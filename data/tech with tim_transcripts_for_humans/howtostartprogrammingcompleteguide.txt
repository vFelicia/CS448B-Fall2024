00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - if you were just getting started with
00:10 - programming then chances are you're
00:11 - overwhelmed by the number of videos
00:13 - courses articles languages frameworks
00:16 - and just overall content that you could
00:18 - potentially start with now getting
00:20 - started is better than not starting at
00:21 - all but you don't want to start with the
00:23 - wrong content and end up learning a
00:24 - bunch of stuff that you really don't
00:26 - need to know for your programming goals
00:28 - so in this video i'm going to give you a
00:30 - five-step guide that you can follow to
00:33 - start programming right now now this is
00:35 - meant to be a general enough guide that
00:37 - this will work for really any
00:38 - programming goals and what i mean by
00:40 - that is why do you want to start
00:42 - programming do you want to write basic
00:43 - scripts do you want to write bots that
00:45 - automate a website do you want to do
00:47 - game development what is it do you want
00:49 - to do and then what should you learn
00:50 - based on those specific goals there is
00:53 - not one size fits all you do have to do
00:55 - a bit of research but this guide should
00:57 - give you the steps that you can follow
00:58 - along with to understand where you
01:00 - should start programming and not be
01:02 - wondering if you're starting in the
01:03 - wrong spot now with that said i will
01:05 - mention that i myself do have a
01:06 - programming course it's called
01:07 - programming expert now this course is
01:10 - designed for people with no prior
01:11 - experience or who are beginner
01:13 - programmers to get to a software
01:15 - engineering level as fast as possible so
01:17 - it teaches programming fundamentals
01:19 - object-oriented programming advanced
01:21 - programming software engineering tools
01:23 - software design we have coding projects
01:26 - in there it's really meant to bring you
01:28 - to this level as fast as possible so if
01:30 - you're serious about programming and you
01:32 - do want to become a software engineer
01:33 - then check it out from the link in the
01:35 - description and you can use discount
01:36 - code tim to get a small discount at
01:38 - checkout now i will mention that this is
01:40 - not for everyone if you want to be a
01:41 - game developer for example if you're
01:43 - just doing this for a hobby maybe you
01:45 - want to just write some basic scripts
01:46 - maybe this course isn't for you and this
01:48 - actually leads me really nicely into
01:50 - step number one for this video which is
01:53 - to pick a topic now what i mean by this
01:55 - is that you need to really narrow down
01:58 - why it is you want to learn how to code
02:00 - and specifically what you want to learn
02:02 - how to code what do you want to make
02:04 - what do you want to do with code why are
02:06 - you learning this once you know that
02:08 - it's a lot easier to go and pick a
02:09 - language or an ide or the tools to
02:12 - download but you need to have that
02:13 - figured out first so what i'm going to
02:15 - do is list out a few topics and maybe
02:17 - reasons why you may want to learn how to
02:19 - code and then in the next section or the
02:21 - next step of this video i'll talk about
02:23 - some specific languages that you may
02:25 - want to learn based on those topics so
02:27 - for example you may be interested in
02:29 - mobile app development web development
02:31 - maybe you want to make bots maybe you
02:32 - want to scrape websites maybe you want
02:34 - to do some basic scripting you just want
02:36 - to write a tool for yourself maybe just
02:38 - want to have some fun you're just doing
02:39 - this as a hobby maybe you want to do
02:41 - machine learning and ai maybe you want
02:42 - to get into data science maybe you want
02:44 - to do game development maybe you don't
02:47 - care and you just want to be a software
02:48 - engineer and get paid six figures
02:50 - there's a bunch of different options
02:52 - here and again you really need to narrow
02:53 - down what this goal is and do some
02:55 - research and figure out the different
02:57 - areas of programming there's so many
02:59 - different fields that you could go in
03:00 - and i'm just barely scratching the
03:02 - surface here on what's possible and what
03:03 - you can do with programming but these
03:05 - are kind of the general disciplines and
03:07 - domains that you're going to be picking
03:09 - between and so do some research figure
03:11 - out what really interests you and what
03:13 - you'd like to start with you can always
03:14 - change later on but the language you're
03:16 - going to learn first is going to be the
03:18 - one that's based on what you're actually
03:19 - going to want to make right what you
03:21 - want to complete what you want to do
03:22 - with your coding knowledge so now we're
03:24 - moving on to step number two which is
03:26 - the most difficult and this is to pick a
03:29 - language now at this point you do have
03:31 - to understand why you want to learn how
03:33 - to code and generally what you want to
03:35 - make with code is it apps is it games is
03:38 - it just general scripting do you want to
03:39 - make bots once you have those answers
03:42 - then i can start recommending some
03:43 - languages for you to learn now i do want
03:45 - to kind of say here that this is tricky
03:47 - and a lot of times you'll start learning
03:49 - a language and realize it's not for you
03:51 - and switch over as a beginner that's
03:53 - completely fine and a lot of the stuff
03:55 - you learn in one programming language
03:56 - will directly translate into another
03:58 - programming language especially when
04:00 - we're talking about kind of just the
04:01 - basics and when you're just getting
04:03 - started it's really when you're getting
04:05 - into more specific stuff that you could
04:06 - say lose a lot of knowledge by learning
04:09 - something you don't need and then moving
04:10 - over to another programming language and
04:12 - having to relearn kind of the advanced
04:14 - and more specific stuff for that
04:15 - language hopefully that makes a bit of
04:17 - sense but i just want to stress here
04:18 - that it's not a huge deal if you pick
04:20 - the wrong language you can switch over
04:22 - especially if you do it in kind of a
04:23 - timely manner anyways the five most
04:26 - popular programming languages today and
04:28 - the ones you can't really go
04:30 - wrong learning are going to be python
04:32 - javascript java c plus plus and c sharp
04:36 - now i didn't list them in the specific
04:37 - order but those are the five most
04:39 - popular programming languages and if you
04:41 - learn any of those that is not going to
04:43 - be wasted knowledge or wasted time those
04:45 - are used at tons of different companies
04:47 - for tons of different projects and you
04:49 - can make almost anything with all of
04:51 - those different languages now each
04:53 - language does have its you know
04:54 - strengths kind of pros and cons but
04:56 - those are very general languages and you
04:58 - can use a lot of stuff and make a lot of
05:00 - stuff with it all right so now that i've
05:02 - gone through all of that what i want to
05:04 - do is go through all of the topics that
05:06 - i uh listed in step one and then talk to
05:08 - you about some specific languages you
05:10 - may want to learn for those topics now
05:12 - these are recommendations this does not
05:14 - mean these are the only languages that
05:16 - you can possibly use these are just kind
05:18 - of the industry standard and what i'm
05:20 - most familiar with so keep that in mind
05:22 - okay mobile app development you need to
05:24 - pick within mobile app development if
05:26 - you want to do ios or android there is a
05:28 - few languages that work for both but
05:30 - generally speaking if you're going to be
05:31 - a mobile app developer you're going to
05:33 - get paid you're going to do just ios or
05:35 - just android so for ios the language
05:38 - you're going to want to learn is swift
05:40 - now you also could learn objective c
05:42 - both of those work but swift is kind of
05:43 - the newer more modern one and what i
05:45 - would recommend now for android you can
05:47 - learn java or you can learn kotlin now
05:50 - both of these languages work for
05:52 - building android applications java is a
05:54 - lot more general so i'd probably
05:55 - recommend that but kotlin is more
05:57 - specific just for android applications
06:00 - so i have a look at both of those
06:02 - okay moving on we have web development
06:04 - now if you want to be a web developer
06:05 - you are going to need to know javascript
06:07 - now that's specifically if you want to
06:08 - work on the front end if you want to
06:10 - work on the back end you may consider
06:12 - checking out a language like python or
06:14 - like go now moving on we have bots in
06:16 - automation one of the best things to do
06:18 - for bots and automation would be python
06:21 - this is if you want to be like web
06:22 - scraping if you want to build a bot that
06:24 - buys sneakers for you you can do that
06:26 - really easily using a language like
06:27 - python
06:28 - continuing we have scripting now
06:30 - scripting is just writing kind of small
06:32 - scripts that aren't you know having a
06:34 - user interface or being a large
06:36 - application you can do this with really
06:37 - any programming language but for this
06:39 - i'm going to recommend python just
06:41 - because it's really easy to learn and
06:42 - generally good for scripting moving on
06:44 - we have machine learning and ai now for
06:47 - machine learning and ai i'm going to
06:48 - recommend python again although you
06:50 - could link learn a language like r sorry
06:53 - then move on to data science for data
06:55 - science you're going to have r and
06:57 - python as the main languages again
06:59 - there's some other ones you can learn
07:00 - this is just generally speaking and then
07:02 - lastly we have game development now for
07:04 - game development you're gonna learn c
07:05 - sharp or c plus plus depends on the type
07:08 - of game development that you're doing i
07:10 - would recommend you look into something
07:11 - called unity as well this is how you can
07:13 - make 3d games it's kind of a
07:15 - full-fledged ide that uses c-sharp as
07:18 - the main programming language so
07:20 - hopefully that gave you a decent kind of
07:22 - introduction to what you want may want
07:24 - to learn for each of these topics again
07:26 - you can get into specifics and some
07:27 - people will tell me oh i'm wrong you
07:29 - should learn this language for that this
07:30 - is generally speaking what you should
07:32 - learn now let's move on to step number
07:35 - three alright so at this point in time
07:37 - hopefully you have picked a topic you
07:38 - have picked a language and now you want
07:40 - to start writing some code however
07:42 - before you can do that you need to have
07:44 - somewhere to write your code and that is
07:46 - why step number three is to download an
07:49 - ide or a code editor now an ide is an
07:52 - integrated development environment this
07:54 - is just a more feature rich program or
07:57 - piece of software you're going to
07:58 - install on your computer a code editor
08:00 - is kind of more bare bones piece of
08:01 - software it doesn't really matter as a
08:04 - beginner which one you download but i
08:05 - just wanted to differentiate you have
08:07 - ides and you have code editors the line
08:09 - is kind of blurred on which is which but
08:11 - you'll see when you're looking around
08:12 - something says ide something says editor
08:15 - that's kind of the main difference one
08:16 - just has more features than the other
08:18 - anyways for this step right here what
08:20 - you download is going to depend on what
08:23 - programming language you want to work in
08:24 - however generally speaking vs code is
08:27 - the ide that i'm going to recommend to
08:29 - you this is completely free i'll leave a
08:31 - link to it in the description and fun
08:33 - fact i actually worked on vs code when i
08:35 - worked at microsoft anyways vs code
08:38 - works for almost every single
08:39 - programming language very general a lot
08:41 - of people use this so that's what i'll
08:43 - recommend however there is a ton of
08:45 - other options and if you're working in
08:47 - something like unity or c-sharp then
08:49 - you're going to download unity now if
08:51 - you want to be a game developer unity is
08:53 - its own ide its own i guess platform you
08:56 - could call it for making 3d games and so
08:58 - you're going to download that
09:00 - if you're working in java there's a ton
09:01 - of other options that may be a little
09:03 - bit better than vs code if you're making
09:05 - android applications there's an ide
09:07 - called android studio if you're making
09:09 - ios applications there's an ide called
09:12 - xcode so you can kind of just go on
09:14 - google and search best ide for enter
09:17 - programming language best code editor
09:19 - for enter programming language now if
09:21 - you want a few kind of lighter weight
09:23 - versions here uh or i guess code editors
09:26 - as opposed to ides because all the ones
09:28 - i've mentioned have been ide so far then
09:30 - you can check out sublime text
09:32 - personally that's my favorite i use that
09:33 - in a bunch of videos you have notepad
09:35 - plus plus you have adam and then you
09:37 - have vim i'll let you guys kind of
09:39 - browse through those and you can see
09:40 - what features they all have but
09:42 - generally those will work for most
09:44 - programming languages as well it's only
09:46 - if you're doing something really
09:47 - specific like game development or mobile
09:50 - app development that you're probably
09:51 - going to pick a specific ide like the
09:54 - ones that i mentioned so at this point
09:55 - in time you have picked a topic picked a
09:58 - language and downloaded an ide or editor
10:01 - now it is time to actually write code
10:02 - with step number four which is to learn
10:05 - the basics now i'm going to tell you how
10:07 - i would learn the basics and what basics
10:10 - to learn
10:11 - first of all if you're learning python
10:12 - you can go and look at programming
10:14 - expert even if you don't buy programming
10:16 - expert it gives you kind of all of the
10:18 - piece of curriculum that you may want to
10:19 - follow along to learn however for other
10:22 - programming languages the basics and
10:24 - what you should learn are going to be
10:26 - very similar so i'll give you all of
10:27 - those topics and list them out i do want
10:29 - to mention though that i highly
10:31 - recommend for beginners and people that
10:33 - are kind of new to programming that they
10:35 - start by watching at least one video
10:38 - now this could be like a 30 or 45 minute
10:40 - long video that gives you an
10:42 - introduction to a specific programming
10:44 - language shows you how to set up your
10:46 - environment shows you how to run code
10:48 - you're going to save a ton of time
10:50 - especially as a complete beginner by
10:51 - watching someone who's an expert or at
10:53 - least very experienced in a language go
10:56 - through and kind of give you all the
10:57 - tips and insight that they've learned
10:59 - over the years now once you've got
11:00 - through that you can learn stuff in
11:02 - whatever way you want but for the very
11:04 - very start like when you're writing a
11:06 - hello world program if you've never done
11:08 - this before save yourself some time and
11:10 - just watch a video even if it's only 20
11:12 - minutes long you don't have to go and
11:13 - watch something that's like six or seven
11:15 - hours on an entire language but watch at
11:17 - least the basics and beginning part
11:19 - again because that's going to save you a
11:21 - ton of time and hopefully give you a
11:22 - bunch of tips and insight you wouldn't
11:24 - have figured out until much later
11:26 - however once you've done that you can
11:28 - then learn the following topics in this
11:30 - order in whatever way you see fit so
11:32 - these topics are first program output
11:35 - and running code so you need to know how
11:38 - to output something to the console and
11:39 - you need to know how to run your code
11:41 - that is the first thing you should learn
11:43 - next you should learn about variables
11:45 - then you should learn about program
11:46 - input so how does the user actually give
11:49 - some input to the program and maybe how
11:51 - does it dynamically respond to that next
11:53 - you're going to want to learn about math
11:55 - and arithmetic so how do you add numbers
11:57 - subtract numbers divide multiply
11:59 - exponents kind of the basic operations
12:02 - in a programming language then you're
12:04 - going to want to learn about conditions
12:06 - so conditions are like checking if two
12:07 - variables have the same value for
12:09 - example or if the user typed in
12:11 - something that matches with this string
12:13 - you get the point next we have if else
12:16 - and else if otherwise known as control
12:18 - flow so how do i execute a block of code
12:20 - based on some condition occurring that's
12:23 - what i'm talking about there then you're
12:25 - going to want to learn looping so for
12:27 - loops while loops how do i iterate over
12:29 - something and repeatedly do something
12:31 - multiple times then you're going to want
12:33 - to learn about errors and exceptions so
12:35 - how do i handle an error in my code what
12:38 - happens if i do something wrong what
12:39 - does an error message look like how do i
12:41 - read an error message that stuff is
12:43 - important and well you probably are
12:44 - going to figure that out earlier as well
12:46 - but specifically i would focus on that
12:48 - at this point then you're going to want
12:49 - to learn about things like arrays and
12:51 - lists you may also want to learn about
12:52 - maps and dictionaries and sets kind of
12:55 - different data structures ways of
12:57 - storing multiple pieces of information
12:59 - that's what this kind of subsection is
13:01 - about and then lastly i would learn
13:03 - about functions now there's a ton of
13:06 - stuff in between all of these topics
13:07 - that you're going to have to learn but
13:09 - generally those are the basics of any
13:11 - programming language and once you learn
13:13 - that stuff and you understand
13:15 - conceptually how it works you can go and
13:18 - very easily pick that up in another
13:19 - programming language that's why i was
13:21 - stressing at the beginning you know even
13:23 - if you pick the wrong programming
13:24 - language at least for the start of that
13:26 - all your knowledge pretty much is going
13:28 - to translate into another one the only
13:30 - thing that's going to change is the
13:31 - exact syntax so the way you write the
13:34 - code as opposed to conceptually what's
13:36 - going to happen and kind of what it's
13:37 - doing anyways that was step number four
13:40 - again i highly recommend that you watch
13:42 - some kind of video tutorial when you're
13:43 - just getting started i have video
13:45 - tutorials on go c plus plus python
13:49 - javascript java bunch of other languages
13:52 - so maybe check my channel if you want to
13:54 - find those and with that said let's go
13:56 - to step number five all right so my last
13:58 - step here is going to be a short one and
14:00 - this is to work on a project so if
14:03 - you're at the point where you have
14:04 - learned the basics of a programming
14:06 - language you know all of those topics
14:08 - that i listed before and you kind of
14:10 - have a general competence or a general
14:13 - sense of how to write code you want to
14:15 - immediately get into some type of
14:17 - project now this does not have to be
14:18 - huge doesn't have to be overwhelming you
14:20 - can work on something very small but you
14:22 - want to apply your skills into a project
14:24 - and make that a habit as you're learning
14:26 - how to code because the best way to get
14:28 - better is to do something yourself and
14:30 - actually work on something where you can
14:32 - apply all of your skills in one place
14:34 - now an example of a few projects that
14:36 - are really beginner friendly and should
14:37 - work in any programming language would
14:40 - be something like a choose your own
14:41 - adventure game so you can ask the user
14:43 - you know do you want to go left or right
14:45 - do you pick up the axe or the sword
14:46 - whatever you get the point let's choose
14:48 - your own adventure game uh you could do
14:50 - something like a quiz game so maybe you
14:51 - have a 10 question quiz you ask the user
14:54 - uh you know a bunch of questions and
14:56 - then you calculate the score at the end
14:58 - give them like what percentage they had
15:00 - that utilizes a fair amount of the
15:01 - things i talked about before you could
15:03 - do something like a contact list so
15:05 - maybe write a program that allows you to
15:07 - store a bunch of users contacts and kind
15:09 - of search for users something like that
15:11 - and if you want some project ideas you
15:13 - could check out programming expert we
15:15 - have a few free ones on there that you
15:16 - can have a look at and of course if you
15:18 - purchased it then you would be able to
15:19 - see the full walkthrough on how to
15:21 - complete that project so that said i am
15:23 - going to start wrapping up the video
15:24 - here this was a difficult video to make
15:26 - because i wanted to make it general
15:28 - enough that it works for everyone but
15:30 - specific enough that i could actually
15:31 - give you some actionable advice and
15:33 - things to go do so hopefully i struck
15:35 - that balance all right i will mention
15:37 - here that if you stuck around to the end
15:39 - you get a little bonus let me turn on my
15:40 - other camera here i just got a new cat

Cleaned transcript:

if you were just getting started with programming then chances are you're overwhelmed by the number of videos courses articles languages frameworks and just overall content that you could potentially start with now getting started is better than not starting at all but you don't want to start with the wrong content and end up learning a bunch of stuff that you really don't need to know for your programming goals so in this video i'm going to give you a fivestep guide that you can follow to start programming right now now this is meant to be a general enough guide that this will work for really any programming goals and what i mean by that is why do you want to start programming do you want to write basic scripts do you want to write bots that automate a website do you want to do game development what is it do you want to do and then what should you learn based on those specific goals there is not one size fits all you do have to do a bit of research but this guide should give you the steps that you can follow along with to understand where you should start programming and not be wondering if you're starting in the wrong spot now with that said i will mention that i myself do have a programming course it's called programming expert now this course is designed for people with no prior experience or who are beginner programmers to get to a software engineering level as fast as possible so it teaches programming fundamentals objectoriented programming advanced programming software engineering tools software design we have coding projects in there it's really meant to bring you to this level as fast as possible so if you're serious about programming and you do want to become a software engineer then check it out from the link in the description and you can use discount code tim to get a small discount at checkout now i will mention that this is not for everyone if you want to be a game developer for example if you're just doing this for a hobby maybe you want to just write some basic scripts maybe this course isn't for you and this actually leads me really nicely into step number one for this video which is to pick a topic now what i mean by this is that you need to really narrow down why it is you want to learn how to code and specifically what you want to learn how to code what do you want to make what do you want to do with code why are you learning this once you know that it's a lot easier to go and pick a language or an ide or the tools to download but you need to have that figured out first so what i'm going to do is list out a few topics and maybe reasons why you may want to learn how to code and then in the next section or the next step of this video i'll talk about some specific languages that you may want to learn based on those topics so for example you may be interested in mobile app development web development maybe you want to make bots maybe you want to scrape websites maybe you want to do some basic scripting you just want to write a tool for yourself maybe just want to have some fun you're just doing this as a hobby maybe you want to do machine learning and ai maybe you want to get into data science maybe you want to do game development maybe you don't care and you just want to be a software engineer and get paid six figures there's a bunch of different options here and again you really need to narrow down what this goal is and do some research and figure out the different areas of programming there's so many different fields that you could go in and i'm just barely scratching the surface here on what's possible and what you can do with programming but these are kind of the general disciplines and domains that you're going to be picking between and so do some research figure out what really interests you and what you'd like to start with you can always change later on but the language you're going to learn first is going to be the one that's based on what you're actually going to want to make right what you want to complete what you want to do with your coding knowledge so now we're moving on to step number two which is the most difficult and this is to pick a language now at this point you do have to understand why you want to learn how to code and generally what you want to make with code is it apps is it games is it just general scripting do you want to make bots once you have those answers then i can start recommending some languages for you to learn now i do want to kind of say here that this is tricky and a lot of times you'll start learning a language and realize it's not for you and switch over as a beginner that's completely fine and a lot of the stuff you learn in one programming language will directly translate into another programming language especially when we're talking about kind of just the basics and when you're just getting started it's really when you're getting into more specific stuff that you could say lose a lot of knowledge by learning something you don't need and then moving over to another programming language and having to relearn kind of the advanced and more specific stuff for that language hopefully that makes a bit of sense but i just want to stress here that it's not a huge deal if you pick the wrong language you can switch over especially if you do it in kind of a timely manner anyways the five most popular programming languages today and the ones you can't really go wrong learning are going to be python javascript java c plus plus and c sharp now i didn't list them in the specific order but those are the five most popular programming languages and if you learn any of those that is not going to be wasted knowledge or wasted time those are used at tons of different companies for tons of different projects and you can make almost anything with all of those different languages now each language does have its you know strengths kind of pros and cons but those are very general languages and you can use a lot of stuff and make a lot of stuff with it all right so now that i've gone through all of that what i want to do is go through all of the topics that i uh listed in step one and then talk to you about some specific languages you may want to learn for those topics now these are recommendations this does not mean these are the only languages that you can possibly use these are just kind of the industry standard and what i'm most familiar with so keep that in mind okay mobile app development you need to pick within mobile app development if you want to do ios or android there is a few languages that work for both but generally speaking if you're going to be a mobile app developer you're going to get paid you're going to do just ios or just android so for ios the language you're going to want to learn is swift now you also could learn objective c both of those work but swift is kind of the newer more modern one and what i would recommend now for android you can learn java or you can learn kotlin now both of these languages work for building android applications java is a lot more general so i'd probably recommend that but kotlin is more specific just for android applications so i have a look at both of those okay moving on we have web development now if you want to be a web developer you are going to need to know javascript now that's specifically if you want to work on the front end if you want to work on the back end you may consider checking out a language like python or like go now moving on we have bots in automation one of the best things to do for bots and automation would be python this is if you want to be like web scraping if you want to build a bot that buys sneakers for you you can do that really easily using a language like python continuing we have scripting now scripting is just writing kind of small scripts that aren't you know having a user interface or being a large application you can do this with really any programming language but for this i'm going to recommend python just because it's really easy to learn and generally good for scripting moving on we have machine learning and ai now for machine learning and ai i'm going to recommend python again although you could link learn a language like r sorry then move on to data science for data science you're going to have r and python as the main languages again there's some other ones you can learn this is just generally speaking and then lastly we have game development now for game development you're gonna learn c sharp or c plus plus depends on the type of game development that you're doing i would recommend you look into something called unity as well this is how you can make 3d games it's kind of a fullfledged ide that uses csharp as the main programming language so hopefully that gave you a decent kind of introduction to what you want may want to learn for each of these topics again you can get into specifics and some people will tell me oh i'm wrong you should learn this language for that this is generally speaking what you should learn now let's move on to step number three alright so at this point in time hopefully you have picked a topic you have picked a language and now you want to start writing some code however before you can do that you need to have somewhere to write your code and that is why step number three is to download an ide or a code editor now an ide is an integrated development environment this is just a more feature rich program or piece of software you're going to install on your computer a code editor is kind of more bare bones piece of software it doesn't really matter as a beginner which one you download but i just wanted to differentiate you have ides and you have code editors the line is kind of blurred on which is which but you'll see when you're looking around something says ide something says editor that's kind of the main difference one just has more features than the other anyways for this step right here what you download is going to depend on what programming language you want to work in however generally speaking vs code is the ide that i'm going to recommend to you this is completely free i'll leave a link to it in the description and fun fact i actually worked on vs code when i worked at microsoft anyways vs code works for almost every single programming language very general a lot of people use this so that's what i'll recommend however there is a ton of other options and if you're working in something like unity or csharp then you're going to download unity now if you want to be a game developer unity is its own ide its own i guess platform you could call it for making 3d games and so you're going to download that if you're working in java there's a ton of other options that may be a little bit better than vs code if you're making android applications there's an ide called android studio if you're making ios applications there's an ide called xcode so you can kind of just go on google and search best ide for enter programming language best code editor for enter programming language now if you want a few kind of lighter weight versions here uh or i guess code editors as opposed to ides because all the ones i've mentioned have been ide so far then you can check out sublime text personally that's my favorite i use that in a bunch of videos you have notepad plus plus you have adam and then you have vim i'll let you guys kind of browse through those and you can see what features they all have but generally those will work for most programming languages as well it's only if you're doing something really specific like game development or mobile app development that you're probably going to pick a specific ide like the ones that i mentioned so at this point in time you have picked a topic picked a language and downloaded an ide or editor now it is time to actually write code with step number four which is to learn the basics now i'm going to tell you how i would learn the basics and what basics to learn first of all if you're learning python you can go and look at programming expert even if you don't buy programming expert it gives you kind of all of the piece of curriculum that you may want to follow along to learn however for other programming languages the basics and what you should learn are going to be very similar so i'll give you all of those topics and list them out i do want to mention though that i highly recommend for beginners and people that are kind of new to programming that they start by watching at least one video now this could be like a 30 or 45 minute long video that gives you an introduction to a specific programming language shows you how to set up your environment shows you how to run code you're going to save a ton of time especially as a complete beginner by watching someone who's an expert or at least very experienced in a language go through and kind of give you all the tips and insight that they've learned over the years now once you've got through that you can learn stuff in whatever way you want but for the very very start like when you're writing a hello world program if you've never done this before save yourself some time and just watch a video even if it's only 20 minutes long you don't have to go and watch something that's like six or seven hours on an entire language but watch at least the basics and beginning part again because that's going to save you a ton of time and hopefully give you a bunch of tips and insight you wouldn't have figured out until much later however once you've done that you can then learn the following topics in this order in whatever way you see fit so these topics are first program output and running code so you need to know how to output something to the console and you need to know how to run your code that is the first thing you should learn next you should learn about variables then you should learn about program input so how does the user actually give some input to the program and maybe how does it dynamically respond to that next you're going to want to learn about math and arithmetic so how do you add numbers subtract numbers divide multiply exponents kind of the basic operations in a programming language then you're going to want to learn about conditions so conditions are like checking if two variables have the same value for example or if the user typed in something that matches with this string you get the point next we have if else and else if otherwise known as control flow so how do i execute a block of code based on some condition occurring that's what i'm talking about there then you're going to want to learn looping so for loops while loops how do i iterate over something and repeatedly do something multiple times then you're going to want to learn about errors and exceptions so how do i handle an error in my code what happens if i do something wrong what does an error message look like how do i read an error message that stuff is important and well you probably are going to figure that out earlier as well but specifically i would focus on that at this point then you're going to want to learn about things like arrays and lists you may also want to learn about maps and dictionaries and sets kind of different data structures ways of storing multiple pieces of information that's what this kind of subsection is about and then lastly i would learn about functions now there's a ton of stuff in between all of these topics that you're going to have to learn but generally those are the basics of any programming language and once you learn that stuff and you understand conceptually how it works you can go and very easily pick that up in another programming language that's why i was stressing at the beginning you know even if you pick the wrong programming language at least for the start of that all your knowledge pretty much is going to translate into another one the only thing that's going to change is the exact syntax so the way you write the code as opposed to conceptually what's going to happen and kind of what it's doing anyways that was step number four again i highly recommend that you watch some kind of video tutorial when you're just getting started i have video tutorials on go c plus plus python javascript java bunch of other languages so maybe check my channel if you want to find those and with that said let's go to step number five all right so my last step here is going to be a short one and this is to work on a project so if you're at the point where you have learned the basics of a programming language you know all of those topics that i listed before and you kind of have a general competence or a general sense of how to write code you want to immediately get into some type of project now this does not have to be huge doesn't have to be overwhelming you can work on something very small but you want to apply your skills into a project and make that a habit as you're learning how to code because the best way to get better is to do something yourself and actually work on something where you can apply all of your skills in one place now an example of a few projects that are really beginner friendly and should work in any programming language would be something like a choose your own adventure game so you can ask the user you know do you want to go left or right do you pick up the axe or the sword whatever you get the point let's choose your own adventure game uh you could do something like a quiz game so maybe you have a 10 question quiz you ask the user uh you know a bunch of questions and then you calculate the score at the end give them like what percentage they had that utilizes a fair amount of the things i talked about before you could do something like a contact list so maybe write a program that allows you to store a bunch of users contacts and kind of search for users something like that and if you want some project ideas you could check out programming expert we have a few free ones on there that you can have a look at and of course if you purchased it then you would be able to see the full walkthrough on how to complete that project so that said i am going to start wrapping up the video here this was a difficult video to make because i wanted to make it general enough that it works for everyone but specific enough that i could actually give you some actionable advice and things to go do so hopefully i struck that balance all right i will mention here that if you stuck around to the end you get a little bonus let me turn on my other camera here i just got a new cat recently her name is sophie and she's chilling right here so there you go i also have another cat if you guys watch the channel her name is fresca don't worry fresca is still around we've just gotten a new addition to the family here called sophie so welcome her to the channel leave a comment down below hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you did like subscribe and i will see you in another one you
