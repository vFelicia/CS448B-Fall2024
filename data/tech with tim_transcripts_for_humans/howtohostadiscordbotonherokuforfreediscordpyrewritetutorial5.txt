00:00 - hey guys and welcome to another discord
00:03 - rewrite tutorial so in today's video I'm
00:05 - not gonna be writing any code I'm just
00:07 - gonna be showing you guys how we can
00:08 - upload our bot to something called
00:10 - Heroku so that it can be hosted for us
00:13 - completely for free and that means we
00:15 - don't actually have to run this Python
00:16 - script on our own computer we can just
00:18 - run it off of a server that Roku is
00:21 - generously letting us use for free and
00:23 - then it will always be online on our
00:25 - server to show you quickly you can see
00:27 - I'm in PyCharm right now and I mean you
00:28 - don't have to believe me but I don't
00:30 - have any other Python processes running
00:32 - on my computer and my bought from my
00:34 - actual discord server is currently
00:36 - running and you can see you guys are
00:38 - just looking at the logs that's fine if
00:39 - I go to bought dog commands like people
00:41 - have been using this bought and it works
00:42 - and everything that we've coded works
00:44 - completely fine and it's running not off
00:47 - of my computer off of the server and it
00:48 - doesn't go offline unless like there's
00:51 - an error that pops up or something like
00:53 - that
00:53 - right so anyways that is what we're
00:56 - gonna be showing you how to do in this
00:58 - tutorial so our first step is what we
01:01 - need to get to Heroku okay so this is
01:03 - I'm gonna leave all these links in the
01:05 - description and this entire instruction
01:06 - set will be on my website so if any of
01:08 - the what do you call it like the
01:10 - commands I use it or stuff like you want
01:12 - to copy them rather than typing them out
01:13 - you can just go to my website website
01:15 - tech with Tim net and they'll all be up
01:17 - on there so anyways I've already created
01:18 - a test bot but we're gonna do is when
01:20 - you go to Heroku and you can just do
01:21 - this by either clicking the link in the
01:23 - description or just searching it up
01:24 - you're gonna click here and you can see
01:26 - I have two BOTS so this one is actually
01:28 - the one that's running on my disk word
01:30 - server this one I just created so what
01:32 - you're gonna do is you gonna sign in or
01:33 - create an account if you don't already
01:34 - have one I don't think I need to walk
01:36 - you through doing that you're gonna
01:38 - click on new and then create new app now
01:41 - it's gonna ask you for a name
01:42 - make sure you remember the name that you
01:44 - use and it has to be unique now it's
01:47 - gonna ask you to like add to pipeline
01:48 - don't do that just I'll show you here
01:50 - just literally make a name and click
01:52 - create app and that's all you need to do
01:54 - to create a new app and then we're gonna
01:56 - go through what I'm gonna do right now
01:57 - okay so then you're gonna go to open
01:59 - your app it should already open up
02:01 - something like this okay
02:02 - and we're gonna do is going to go to
02:05 - what is it deploy now it's gonna say
02:07 - like it's gonna give you some
02:08 - instructions on how to deploy your code
02:10 - to Heroku because essentially what we're
02:12 - gonna do is we're gonna upload this to
02:13 - Heroku and then we're just gonna have
02:15 - like a command that runs and it just
02:17 - gonna continually run our Python script
02:19 - for us so that we don't have to run out
02:21 - on a computer so we're gonna do this
02:23 - using git but what you have to download
02:25 - first this Heroku CLI so I'll actually
02:28 - I'll leave the link here for this in the
02:30 - description as well but if you go and
02:32 - you're on here just click this little
02:33 - thing here this is Heroku CLI and then
02:35 - download that install that run through
02:37 - that make sure you say add to path if it
02:39 - asks you to do that because you're gonna
02:40 - need to do this in the command prompt
02:42 - okay so once you're done that so pause
02:44 - the video do that and then come back to
02:46 - what I'm about to do right now okay so
02:48 - what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
02:49 - have to get into our directory where our
02:51 - Python bot is so this is the directory
02:53 - that mine's in its in desktop Python
02:55 - discord tutorial now you can do this
02:57 - from CMD I just like CD desktop C the
03:01 - Python CD discord tutorial and that's
03:05 - fine now you're in the directory but if
03:07 - you want an easier way to do this or
03:08 - it's like really far what you can do is
03:10 - just go up here and type CMD in the
03:12 - actual name of the directory so in that
03:14 - folder and it'll open up one that'll
03:15 - automatically be the correct directory
03:18 - okay so once you do that what we're
03:19 - gonna type in is Heroku login like this
03:24 - ok now what this is gonna do is just
03:26 - gonna pop up a thing that says something
03:28 - like this it's gonna say press any key
03:30 - to open up browser to login or cue to
03:33 - exit so you're gonna hit enter whatever
03:34 - key you want and now you'll see that it
03:36 - brings me to my browser and then you're
03:38 - just gonna click login and there you go
03:40 - it should just automatically log you in
03:42 - if it asks you to type in your username
03:43 - and password obviously do that and then
03:45 - what you can do is you can close that
03:46 - window and we can come back to the
03:48 - command prompt and start following the
03:50 - next steps so essentially what we do now
03:53 - is we have to set up a few files and
03:55 - dependence dependencies for a project
03:58 - because essentially this is going to
03:59 - upload to like a Linux server and it's
04:01 - just going to read through all your
04:02 - files and look for certain files so that
04:04 - it knows what to do so essentially the
04:06 - first thing you need to do is actually
04:07 - create a something called a proc file
04:10 - now this is gonna do is it's gonna tell
04:12 - the server what file you want to run
04:14 - like what python script because you
04:16 - could have multiple Python scripts
04:18 - so to do this we have to make sure we're
04:20 - in the directory we're gonna type echo
04:22 - like this and then this little what do
04:25 - you call it like greater than sign and
04:26 - then we're just gonna type the name of
04:28 - our file which is gonna be proc file
04:29 - like this a PR OC file okay and just hit
04:33 - enter now you shouldn't see any output
04:34 - here but if you go to will go back to
04:37 - that folder here
04:38 - discord Python discord tutorial you
04:42 - should see now you have a file with no
04:44 - file extension that says proc file so
04:46 - right click on this and edit it with
04:48 - either notepad plus plus that's
04:49 - preferable or notepad and then what
04:51 - you're gonna do is one second sorry it's
04:55 - opening up in my other screen here I
04:56 - think I can drag this yeah there we go
04:58 - sweet so it's gonna say echo is on all
05:00 - you need to do is delete that last line
05:02 - the second line come here and type
05:04 - worker okay and then Python colon log py
05:11 - I think oh I'm I mess it up so it's it's
05:14 - Python log py and you put a colon right
05:16 - before or right after worker hit save
05:19 - like that don't give it a file extension
05:21 - just leave it as like a blank file not a
05:24 - txt or anything okay so worker Python
05:26 - and logged up hi is that what I named it
05:29 - no I named mine bought a pie I don't
05:30 - know why I'm doing it long so bought pie
05:32 - and this is gonna be the name of the
05:33 - Python script you want to run so if you
05:34 - named your like disc where bought then
05:36 - you have to put that there
05:37 - ok so now we have that so now we have
05:39 - that inside of our directory now we have
05:41 - to create one more file in here which is
05:43 - known as the requirements dot txt file
05:45 - now this file is gonna tell us what
05:47 - packages that we need to download to run
05:49 - this bot because obviously this doesn't
05:50 - work on native Python this works using
05:53 - like that discord rewrite package and
05:56 - maybe if you guys use pandas and numpy
05:57 - you're gonna need to put that in your
05:59 - requirements out txt as well so to do
06:01 - this we don't need to do anything in the
06:02 - command prompt just go in your folder
06:03 - click new and then click a text document
06:07 - like this ok now you need to name this
06:09 - require mints dot txt now make sure you
06:14 - spell requirements right I know that's
06:16 - gonna sound stupid but I spelt mine
06:17 - wrong the first like 5 times so trying
06:19 - to upload this and I ran into mistakes
06:21 - so requirements I think that's how you
06:23 - spell it so we'll do that okay now we're
06:25 - gonna open up this txt file and in here
06:27 - we need to paste a few things so I'm
06:29 - just gonna actually paste them and I'll
06:31 - talk about what they
06:32 - and what one do you guys might possibly
06:33 - need that are different from mine okay
06:35 - so I'm gonna paste these right here now
06:37 - I know this looks kind of confusing but
06:39 - essentially these are just everything
06:40 - that it's gonna run pip on so it's gonna
06:42 - run pip get dot this it's gonna run pip
06:44 - pineapple version 1.3 point O it's gonna
06:47 - run pip panda's pip the NS Python pip
06:49 - async timeout now the thing is you might
06:52 - not need all of these like async time
06:53 - out I think automatically comes with
06:55 - Python but I want to make sure that it's
06:57 - the right version for Python 3 6 so
06:59 - that's why I define 3.0 point 1 right
07:02 - and same thing with pineapple um
07:04 - actually I don't think this one
07:06 - automatically installs so there's any
07:07 - packages that you guys knew you had to
07:09 - install using pip make sure you put them
07:12 - in your requirements txt folder like
07:14 - pandas you need that one if you're if
07:16 - you're using that module and like you
07:17 - could put numpy or any other one now I
07:20 - will just say quickly if you guys are
07:21 - trying to use an external database for
07:23 - this that it's gonna like upload to that
07:25 - database for example MongoDB that will
07:28 - not work on Heroku unless you pay for
07:31 - like the extension so just warning there
07:33 - because I tried to do that I was running
07:34 - into a bunch of issues but anyways
07:35 - requirements not txt
07:37 - you need minimum this one you're
07:38 - probably gonna need the NS Python you're
07:40 - probably gonna need pineapple other ones
07:41 - you add in at your own discretion ok
07:43 - there we go so now you're almost set up
07:45 - to actually create a what's known as git
07:47 - repository and now upload this to Heroku
07:49 - so we have these I would actually
07:52 - recommend you delete this dot idea file
07:54 - if you don't need it if like you're in a
07:56 - what do you call it pie charm so I'm
07:57 - gonna delete that and now we'll go back
08:00 - to our command prompt and we'll start
08:02 - the next few commands and actually sorry
08:05 - before I do that I just forgot we're
08:06 - gonna add one thing to our I bought here
08:08 - so I hope you didn't close it but go to
08:10 - uh let's see here settings and you're
08:13 - gonna go down to where it says build
08:15 - packs we're gonna add a Python build
08:17 - pack so to do this we're gonna do add
08:18 - build pack we're gonna go to Python and
08:21 - we're just gonna Save Changes and that
08:24 - is a sense that's that's all you need to
08:25 - do to add the build pack just so it
08:27 - knows we're gonna be running Python I
08:28 - think it will automatically detect
08:29 - anyways but to make sure we're gonna do
08:31 - that okay so now we're back in our
08:32 - command prompt and what we need to type
08:34 - now is I have to look so I don't forget
08:36 - so we're already logged into Heroku so
08:38 - now we're gonna do get an it okay so
08:41 - initialize the empty git repository in
08:43 - this folder alright so
08:45 - what we're gonna be doing now is we're
08:46 - gonna be placing all these files that
08:49 - we've been working into this get and I'm
08:50 - gonna be pushing that get to Roku and
08:52 - it's gonna run the get and run all those
08:54 - files okay so now we've done that what's
08:55 - the next step okay so I'm just gonna
08:57 - copy it in so I don't mess it up
08:59 - but we're gonna type this a Roku get :
09:03 - remote - a and then name okay so name
09:06 - you guys have to change this to whatever
09:08 - the name of your application is so mine
09:10 - is test bought three four five okay so
09:12 - I'm gonna do this - a test bought three
09:15 - four five and yours is gonna be whatever
09:17 - name obviously you named it if you have
09:19 - colon to make sure you had colon spread
09:20 - okay so we'll do that and hit enter and
09:24 - set get remote heroku to this okay
09:27 - perfect awesome next step we need to do
09:29 - this do get add dots now this is gonna
09:33 - add all the files in our current
09:34 - directory into that get let's do that
09:37 - there we go you shouldn't see any open
09:39 - for that if it works and there's no
09:40 - errors you're good okay next is git
09:42 - commit all right - a.m. and now in here
09:47 - you just have to take anything like
09:48 - anything you want in quotation marks
09:50 - you're gonna say we'll attack why
09:51 - because when you commit something you
09:53 - just have to give a message so I'm just
09:54 - gonna say cool okay yet is not yeah it
09:59 - wouldn't be get would it would be get
10:00 - okay so what type get to commits - a.m.
10:03 - cool and then five files changed and
10:06 - then it should go through all this and
10:06 - it say what it created into the get okay
10:09 - so awesome now our last step is to push
10:12 - this to Heroku and once we push this to
10:13 - Heroku we should actually be working and
10:16 - we'll check and make sure that means
10:17 - fine so to do this we're gonna do get
10:18 - push Heroku master okay and hit enter
10:23 - and that you should see output like this
10:25 - if you're not you did something wrong go
10:27 - back and check failed to push what's the
10:29 - issue
10:30 - remote rejected master master pre
10:32 - received hook declined all right give me
10:34 - a sec guys
10:35 - okay so essentially the issue was the
10:38 - fact that this requirements one before
10:40 - this text file sorry in our directory
10:42 - here I had this dot txt extension so it
10:44 - looked like requirements dot txt dot txt
10:47 - because it adds the extension afterwards
10:49 - that we can't see so that was the issue
10:51 - so I just have to remove this dot txt
10:53 - hit enter we're just gonna have to
10:55 - recommit to our get Riyad these files
10:57 - this actually is good because it's
10:58 - showing you like if you ever
10:59 - change anything this is the way that you
11:01 - recommit Andrey push to Heroku so
11:04 - imagine that worked fine and now we
11:06 - change something we want to recommit
11:07 - well what we do is you get commit - am
11:09 - whatever message you want okay nothing
11:12 - to commit that's just because I already
11:13 - committed and looked at it be or should
11:14 - say like changing deleting whatever and
11:16 - then we're gonna do get add period okay
11:19 - now we're good now we can push to Heroku
11:22 - so get Heroku push Mass get push Roku
11:28 - master now I don't even ever vote it was
11:29 - get push Heroku master okay let's try
11:33 - that everything up to date that's just
11:35 - cuz I already uploaded it but you guys
11:37 - should go through this and it should
11:38 - work I apologize for that mistake but
11:41 - it's actually almost kind of good
11:42 - because I'm showing you how you can
11:43 - re-upload stuff and look at it okay so
11:45 - now that is there let's actually see if
11:48 - this is working and let's look at some
11:50 - log files and stuff so let's go test
11:52 - server okay so it's not up yet so let's
11:54 - see if we made any mistakes like in our
11:56 - logs so essentially if that doesn't work
11:58 - for you what you can do is you can go
12:00 - you can look at your logs we're going
12:01 - Heroku logs - a and then whatever the
12:06 - name of your bought was so I don't even
12:07 - know what I named my test - bought -
12:10 - three four five and let's see if that
12:13 - pops up the logs me gonna have a look ok
12:14 - so awesome so it says deploy release so
12:17 - right now it's build failed that was
12:19 - that was earlier but right now it
12:20 - actually worked
12:21 - so let's go to Heroku and let's turn
12:22 - this on and and get the bot running
12:25 - resources okay there you go sweet so now
12:27 - we just have to actually turn this on so
12:29 - we have worker Python potpie so that
12:31 - showed up I didn't just add this in so
12:33 - let's go to this edit tab let's turn
12:35 - this on let's hit confirm and let's pray
12:38 - that this is gonna work okay so now
12:40 - we're gonna come in here and we're gonna
12:42 - hopefully see in like 30 or 40 seconds
12:46 - that this bot turns online so I'll fast
12:47 - forward and wow would you look at that
12:49 - it's online okay sweet so now it's
12:52 - working so let's try like hello and then
12:55 - we get hi back and there we go our
12:56 - discord bot is officially on Heroku now
12:59 - last things I'm sure you guys are
13:00 - probably ready clicked off the video by
13:01 - now but if you want to see how to look
13:03 - at logs and how to manually run stuff on
13:06 - this Heroku server what you can do is
13:08 - you can do Heroku - or
13:11 - Roku logs - a so like whatever I just
13:14 - types a test bought at 3:45 hit enter
13:16 - and then we'll run the most recent logs
13:18 - for you so it'll say like what was
13:19 - created and if you want to see the tale
13:21 - logs because sometimes it doesn't do it
13:22 - you can do logs - - tale it'll show you
13:26 - the ones at the end and let's see and
13:28 - yeah so it goes through and it'll show
13:30 - you the logs and you can have a look so
13:32 - if anything like failed then you can see
13:33 - that now if you want to run bash on your
13:36 - server and like manually run Python
13:38 - scripts what you can do is go to Heroku
13:40 - run bash and then - a again the name of
13:44 - your BOTS o test - bought - 3 4 5 ok it
13:50 - should just take a second to run bash
13:52 - and then if you wanted to manually run a
13:54 - python script you can type python the
13:56 - name of the script and it'll run it for
13:58 - you on the server and we'll give you the
13:59 - output as well so for example I do
14:01 - Python and I ran bought PI this actually
14:04 - won't work is my boss already running
14:06 - but you could do that and then it would
14:08 - run that Python script manually for you
14:10 - when you're done you can just type exit
14:12 - this is like a pretty simple Linux
14:13 - command and it'll just get out of that
14:15 - bash for you so anyway so that has been
14:17 - how to host your bought on Heroku as
14:18 - always if you guys have any questions
14:20 - please don't hesitate to ask me on
14:21 - discord or in the comments below
14:22 - if this video helps you out please make
14:24 - sure you leave a like and subscribe and
14:25 - I will see you again in another one
14:27 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome to another discord rewrite tutorial so in today's video I'm not gonna be writing any code I'm just gonna be showing you guys how we can upload our bot to something called Heroku so that it can be hosted for us completely for free and that means we don't actually have to run this Python script on our own computer we can just run it off of a server that Roku is generously letting us use for free and then it will always be online on our server to show you quickly you can see I'm in PyCharm right now and I mean you don't have to believe me but I don't have any other Python processes running on my computer and my bought from my actual discord server is currently running and you can see you guys are just looking at the logs that's fine if I go to bought dog commands like people have been using this bought and it works and everything that we've coded works completely fine and it's running not off of my computer off of the server and it doesn't go offline unless like there's an error that pops up or something like that right so anyways that is what we're gonna be showing you how to do in this tutorial so our first step is what we need to get to Heroku okay so this is I'm gonna leave all these links in the description and this entire instruction set will be on my website so if any of the what do you call it like the commands I use it or stuff like you want to copy them rather than typing them out you can just go to my website website tech with Tim net and they'll all be up on there so anyways I've already created a test bot but we're gonna do is when you go to Heroku and you can just do this by either clicking the link in the description or just searching it up you're gonna click here and you can see I have two BOTS so this one is actually the one that's running on my disk word server this one I just created so what you're gonna do is you gonna sign in or create an account if you don't already have one I don't think I need to walk you through doing that you're gonna click on new and then create new app now it's gonna ask you for a name make sure you remember the name that you use and it has to be unique now it's gonna ask you to like add to pipeline don't do that just I'll show you here just literally make a name and click create app and that's all you need to do to create a new app and then we're gonna go through what I'm gonna do right now okay so then you're gonna go to open your app it should already open up something like this okay and we're gonna do is going to go to what is it deploy now it's gonna say like it's gonna give you some instructions on how to deploy your code to Heroku because essentially what we're gonna do is we're gonna upload this to Heroku and then we're just gonna have like a command that runs and it just gonna continually run our Python script for us so that we don't have to run out on a computer so we're gonna do this using git but what you have to download first this Heroku CLI so I'll actually I'll leave the link here for this in the description as well but if you go and you're on here just click this little thing here this is Heroku CLI and then download that install that run through that make sure you say add to path if it asks you to do that because you're gonna need to do this in the command prompt okay so once you're done that so pause the video do that and then come back to what I'm about to do right now okay so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna have to get into our directory where our Python bot is so this is the directory that mine's in its in desktop Python discord tutorial now you can do this from CMD I just like CD desktop C the Python CD discord tutorial and that's fine now you're in the directory but if you want an easier way to do this or it's like really far what you can do is just go up here and type CMD in the actual name of the directory so in that folder and it'll open up one that'll automatically be the correct directory okay so once you do that what we're gonna type in is Heroku login like this ok now what this is gonna do is just gonna pop up a thing that says something like this it's gonna say press any key to open up browser to login or cue to exit so you're gonna hit enter whatever key you want and now you'll see that it brings me to my browser and then you're just gonna click login and there you go it should just automatically log you in if it asks you to type in your username and password obviously do that and then what you can do is you can close that window and we can come back to the command prompt and start following the next steps so essentially what we do now is we have to set up a few files and dependence dependencies for a project because essentially this is going to upload to like a Linux server and it's just going to read through all your files and look for certain files so that it knows what to do so essentially the first thing you need to do is actually create a something called a proc file now this is gonna do is it's gonna tell the server what file you want to run like what python script because you could have multiple Python scripts so to do this we have to make sure we're in the directory we're gonna type echo like this and then this little what do you call it like greater than sign and then we're just gonna type the name of our file which is gonna be proc file like this a PR OC file okay and just hit enter now you shouldn't see any output here but if you go to will go back to that folder here discord Python discord tutorial you should see now you have a file with no file extension that says proc file so right click on this and edit it with either notepad plus plus that's preferable or notepad and then what you're gonna do is one second sorry it's opening up in my other screen here I think I can drag this yeah there we go sweet so it's gonna say echo is on all you need to do is delete that last line the second line come here and type worker okay and then Python colon log py I think oh I'm I mess it up so it's it's Python log py and you put a colon right before or right after worker hit save like that don't give it a file extension just leave it as like a blank file not a txt or anything okay so worker Python and logged up hi is that what I named it no I named mine bought a pie I don't know why I'm doing it long so bought pie and this is gonna be the name of the Python script you want to run so if you named your like disc where bought then you have to put that there ok so now we have that so now we have that inside of our directory now we have to create one more file in here which is known as the requirements dot txt file now this file is gonna tell us what packages that we need to download to run this bot because obviously this doesn't work on native Python this works using like that discord rewrite package and maybe if you guys use pandas and numpy you're gonna need to put that in your requirements out txt as well so to do this we don't need to do anything in the command prompt just go in your folder click new and then click a text document like this ok now you need to name this require mints dot txt now make sure you spell requirements right I know that's gonna sound stupid but I spelt mine wrong the first like 5 times so trying to upload this and I ran into mistakes so requirements I think that's how you spell it so we'll do that okay now we're gonna open up this txt file and in here we need to paste a few things so I'm just gonna actually paste them and I'll talk about what they and what one do you guys might possibly need that are different from mine okay so I'm gonna paste these right here now I know this looks kind of confusing but essentially these are just everything that it's gonna run pip on so it's gonna run pip get dot this it's gonna run pip pineapple version 1.3 point O it's gonna run pip panda's pip the NS Python pip async timeout now the thing is you might not need all of these like async time out I think automatically comes with Python but I want to make sure that it's the right version for Python 3 6 so that's why I define 3.0 point 1 right and same thing with pineapple um actually I don't think this one automatically installs so there's any packages that you guys knew you had to install using pip make sure you put them in your requirements txt folder like pandas you need that one if you're if you're using that module and like you could put numpy or any other one now I will just say quickly if you guys are trying to use an external database for this that it's gonna like upload to that database for example MongoDB that will not work on Heroku unless you pay for like the extension so just warning there because I tried to do that I was running into a bunch of issues but anyways requirements not txt you need minimum this one you're probably gonna need the NS Python you're probably gonna need pineapple other ones you add in at your own discretion ok there we go so now you're almost set up to actually create a what's known as git repository and now upload this to Heroku so we have these I would actually recommend you delete this dot idea file if you don't need it if like you're in a what do you call it pie charm so I'm gonna delete that and now we'll go back to our command prompt and we'll start the next few commands and actually sorry before I do that I just forgot we're gonna add one thing to our I bought here so I hope you didn't close it but go to uh let's see here settings and you're gonna go down to where it says build packs we're gonna add a Python build pack so to do this we're gonna do add build pack we're gonna go to Python and we're just gonna Save Changes and that is a sense that's that's all you need to do to add the build pack just so it knows we're gonna be running Python I think it will automatically detect anyways but to make sure we're gonna do that okay so now we're back in our command prompt and what we need to type now is I have to look so I don't forget so we're already logged into Heroku so now we're gonna do get an it okay so initialize the empty git repository in this folder alright so what we're gonna be doing now is we're gonna be placing all these files that we've been working into this get and I'm gonna be pushing that get to Roku and it's gonna run the get and run all those files okay so now we've done that what's the next step okay so I'm just gonna copy it in so I don't mess it up but we're gonna type this a Roku get remote a and then name okay so name you guys have to change this to whatever the name of your application is so mine is test bought three four five okay so I'm gonna do this a test bought three four five and yours is gonna be whatever name obviously you named it if you have colon to make sure you had colon spread okay so we'll do that and hit enter and set get remote heroku to this okay perfect awesome next step we need to do this do get add dots now this is gonna add all the files in our current directory into that get let's do that there we go you shouldn't see any open for that if it works and there's no errors you're good okay next is git commit all right a.m. and now in here you just have to take anything like anything you want in quotation marks you're gonna say we'll attack why because when you commit something you just have to give a message so I'm just gonna say cool okay yet is not yeah it wouldn't be get would it would be get okay so what type get to commits a.m. cool and then five files changed and then it should go through all this and it say what it created into the get okay so awesome now our last step is to push this to Heroku and once we push this to Heroku we should actually be working and we'll check and make sure that means fine so to do this we're gonna do get push Heroku master okay and hit enter and that you should see output like this if you're not you did something wrong go back and check failed to push what's the issue remote rejected master master pre received hook declined all right give me a sec guys okay so essentially the issue was the fact that this requirements one before this text file sorry in our directory here I had this dot txt extension so it looked like requirements dot txt dot txt because it adds the extension afterwards that we can't see so that was the issue so I just have to remove this dot txt hit enter we're just gonna have to recommit to our get Riyad these files this actually is good because it's showing you like if you ever change anything this is the way that you recommit Andrey push to Heroku so imagine that worked fine and now we change something we want to recommit well what we do is you get commit am whatever message you want okay nothing to commit that's just because I already committed and looked at it be or should say like changing deleting whatever and then we're gonna do get add period okay now we're good now we can push to Heroku so get Heroku push Mass get push Roku master now I don't even ever vote it was get push Heroku master okay let's try that everything up to date that's just cuz I already uploaded it but you guys should go through this and it should work I apologize for that mistake but it's actually almost kind of good because I'm showing you how you can reupload stuff and look at it okay so now that is there let's actually see if this is working and let's look at some log files and stuff so let's go test server okay so it's not up yet so let's see if we made any mistakes like in our logs so essentially if that doesn't work for you what you can do is you can go you can look at your logs we're going Heroku logs a and then whatever the name of your bought was so I don't even know what I named my test bought three four five and let's see if that pops up the logs me gonna have a look ok so awesome so it says deploy release so right now it's build failed that was that was earlier but right now it actually worked so let's go to Heroku and let's turn this on and and get the bot running resources okay there you go sweet so now we just have to actually turn this on so we have worker Python potpie so that showed up I didn't just add this in so let's go to this edit tab let's turn this on let's hit confirm and let's pray that this is gonna work okay so now we're gonna come in here and we're gonna hopefully see in like 30 or 40 seconds that this bot turns online so I'll fast forward and wow would you look at that it's online okay sweet so now it's working so let's try like hello and then we get hi back and there we go our discord bot is officially on Heroku now last things I'm sure you guys are probably ready clicked off the video by now but if you want to see how to look at logs and how to manually run stuff on this Heroku server what you can do is you can do Heroku or Roku logs a so like whatever I just types a test bought at 345 hit enter and then we'll run the most recent logs for you so it'll say like what was created and if you want to see the tale logs because sometimes it doesn't do it you can do logs tale it'll show you the ones at the end and let's see and yeah so it goes through and it'll show you the logs and you can have a look so if anything like failed then you can see that now if you want to run bash on your server and like manually run Python scripts what you can do is go to Heroku run bash and then a again the name of your BOTS o test bought 3 4 5 ok it should just take a second to run bash and then if you wanted to manually run a python script you can type python the name of the script and it'll run it for you on the server and we'll give you the output as well so for example I do Python and I ran bought PI this actually won't work is my boss already running but you could do that and then it would run that Python script manually for you when you're done you can just type exit this is like a pretty simple Linux command and it'll just get out of that bash for you so anyway so that has been how to host your bought on Heroku as always if you guys have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me on discord or in the comments below if this video helps you out please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another one
