00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - so as the title of the video states i am
00:10 - joining a tech startup in fact i've
00:12 - already joined this tech startup but now
00:14 - it's completely official which is why
00:16 - i'm actually making this video i'm gonna
00:18 - be joining as the only engineer i'm
00:20 - gonna be responsible for building the
00:22 - entire product which is gonna be a
00:23 - mobile application the back end systems
00:26 - all of the automated testing and devops
00:29 - and all of this type of stuff and i'm
00:30 - very very excited i'm going to share
00:31 - some more details with you in just a
00:33 - minute however one thing i need to
00:35 - announce here and discuss which is
00:36 - highly correlated to this opportunity is
00:39 - that if you're watching this video right
00:40 - now the tech with tim youtube channel
00:42 - has officially hit 1 million subscribers
00:46 - now this is absolutely unbelievable i
00:48 - need to give a massive thank you to all
00:50 - of you for really making this goal and
00:52 - this dream come true and supporting me
00:54 - over the almost six years that i've been
00:56 - doing youtube even though i don't
00:58 - respond to all of your comments or
00:59 - necessarily acknowledge everyone
01:01 - subscribe to this channel i do read
01:03 - every single comment on this channel
01:05 - i've seen a lot of you guys for multiple
01:07 - years commenting on my videos being a
01:09 - part of this community and again i just
01:11 - need to give a massive thank you because
01:13 - really your support has genuinely
01:15 - changed my life now with that said i
01:17 - also have put a massive amount of work
01:20 - into this channel as i said almost six
01:22 - years ago i started this when i was in
01:24 - high school i really started to take it
01:26 - seriously when i was about 18 and got
01:27 - into first year university and at this
01:30 - point in time i have almost 750 videos
01:33 - almost 350 hours of recorded content on
01:36 - this channel and i have dumped just so
01:39 - much time
01:40 - into this uh in the past six years i've
01:42 - you know done probably thousands of
01:44 - hours worth of work this has really been
01:47 - my life and i have quite frankly grinded
01:49 - my ass off to produce youtube content
01:51 - for all of you guys and to hopefully set
01:53 - myself up for success going forward
01:55 - which at this point in time i'm quite
01:57 - happy with and i think i've kind of done
01:59 - so the reason i'm saying all this is
02:01 - because at this point in time i've been
02:03 - doing this for so long this has been
02:04 - something i've just been putting so much
02:06 - work sweat and energy into and i'm
02:09 - finally ready to kind of take a slightly
02:11 - different direction here in my career
02:14 - and in my life and do something more
02:16 - related to development as opposed to
02:19 - just filming youtube content all day so
02:21 - what that really means here is that i'm
02:23 - gonna be scaling back my efforts on
02:25 - youtube i'm no longer gonna be posting
02:27 - three or four times per week or coming
02:29 - out with kind of massive tutorial series
02:31 - i'm probably going to try to do one
02:33 - video a week and just take a bit of a
02:35 - break from this constant grind of
02:38 - youtube which i'm sure many of you are
02:39 - familiar with from kind of watching
02:41 - other content creators and move more
02:43 - into this startup position where i'm
02:45 - going to be writing a lot of code i'm
02:46 - finally going to be learning a lot more
02:48 - by actually applying all of my knowledge
02:50 - which is what i tell you guys to do on
02:52 - this channel all of the time and i'm
02:54 - hoping that once that startup kind of
02:56 - starts to take off if that does occur
02:58 - then i'll move back to youtube and take
03:00 - a lot of the knowledge that i've gained
03:01 - and kind of start teaching that again so
03:03 - really the point of this video is that i
03:05 - am taking a slight break from youtube
03:08 - i'm just going to be scaling the efforts
03:09 - back i'm going to be doing kind of my
03:11 - own thing here with this tech startup
03:13 - and i'm also going to be working a few
03:14 - other freelance things and kind of stuff
03:16 - behind the scenes because to just be
03:18 - quite frank with you guys i'm getting a
03:19 - little bit tired of just posting youtube
03:21 - videos constantly and sitting in front
03:23 - of the camera and filming this was
03:25 - something that at one point in time i
03:27 - really really enjoyed i loved doing and
03:29 - that you didn't even have to pay me to
03:31 - do i was doing it essentially for free
03:33 - when i started the channel i wasn't
03:34 - making any money at all but i've just
03:36 - gotten to the point where i'm feeling a
03:38 - bit burned out there is this kind of
03:40 - constant grind mindset trying to get
03:42 - views trying to get subscribers trying
03:43 - to make sure you're being consistent and
03:45 - it does really take a tear on you and
03:47 - honestly i'm surprised i've made it an
03:49 - entire six years so i'm gonna be scaling
03:51 - back a little bit and focusing on
03:53 - something else that i'm actually really
03:54 - excited about for the first time in a
03:56 - while so that's really what i wanted to
03:58 - talk about in this video i'm going to
04:00 - talk more about the startup now but i
04:02 - just want to let you guys know that i'm
04:03 - not going anywhere i'm still going to be
04:05 - posting i just think the format is going
04:07 - to be a bit different it's probably
04:08 - going to be more talking head style
04:10 - stuff as opposed to kind of in-depth
04:12 - tutorials and again i'm doing that just
04:14 - to kind of recharge focus on something
04:16 - else that i'm a lot more excited about
04:19 - and then hopefully take again the
04:20 - knowledge i learned from working on this
04:22 - tech startup and bring it back to
04:23 - youtube and teach you you know within
04:25 - the next year or two years or something
04:26 - along those lines so to the tech startup
04:29 - here what am i doing for this company
04:31 - you know why am i excited about this etc
04:33 - so this is a very early stage company
04:36 - we're just out of kind of the seed
04:37 - fundraising round here it's pretty much
04:39 - a two or three person company at this
04:41 - point in time i am one of the largest
04:43 - shareholders here i'm not necessarily an
04:46 - employee i'm more of a co-founder in a
04:48 - sense although i'm not the majority
04:50 - shareholder of this company and uh yeah
04:52 - i'm gonna be joining as an engineer
04:54 - although i've actually kind of already
04:56 - been working on this for a few months
04:57 - and i'm going to be building out a react
04:59 - native mobile application so
05:01 - cross-platform for both ios and android
05:04 - as well as doing all of the back-end
05:05 - systems all of the data analytics at
05:07 - least when we're starting out building
05:09 - out actually the entire user interface
05:11 - although i'll have people that will
05:13 - design the interface for me that will
05:14 - kind of hire in terms of freelance uh
05:17 - and yeah all of the engineering related
05:19 - tasks that's kind of my role for this
05:20 - company
05:21 - i've already been doing it and honestly
05:23 - i've been very excited i've been a lot
05:25 - more motivated to get up and to start
05:26 - working and uh yeah it's been really
05:28 - nice to work on a very large code base
05:32 - as opposed to kind of these smaller
05:34 - projects which is what i've really been
05:35 - doing on youtube right when i do youtube
05:37 - tutorials and programming maybe it takes
05:39 - me a day or two to prep i write out some
05:41 - code but beyond that i don't extend
05:43 - these projects i don't continue them on
05:45 - i never really see something all the way
05:47 - through and with this that's what i'm
05:49 - planning on doing and again that's why
05:51 - i'm very very excited to really be
05:53 - building something completely from
05:54 - scratch and pretty much alone
05:57 - now assuming this company does well we
05:58 - start generating some revenue bring on
06:00 - some investment then of course there
06:02 - will be other engineers we'll start to
06:03 - grow the business that is a long way
06:05 - away from here so just to take a quick
06:07 - tangent here as i start to end the video
06:10 - i just want to mention that this was a
06:11 - very difficult decision to kind of stop
06:14 - youtube or not necessarily stop but slow
06:15 - it down
06:16 - and move to something that is a lot
06:18 - higher risk
06:19 - right now i could just keep posting
06:21 - youtube videos a few times a week i'd be
06:23 - very comfortable i don't need to do
06:25 - anything drastic i'm essentially
06:26 - operating a company where i can project
06:29 - pretty uh accurately how much money i'm
06:31 - going to be making per month what i can
06:33 - make in a year it's just kind of
06:35 - operating it'd be just be doing the same
06:36 - thing and it's fairly safe at least from
06:39 - my mind and instead of doing that i'm
06:41 - kind of stepping away and moving into
06:43 - something that is much higher risk
06:44 - obviously a higher reward if it does go
06:46 - well but it has a very high chance of
06:48 - failure and the reason i did that is i
06:50 - just figured that this is kind of a
06:51 - great time in my life to take a risk
06:53 - like that if it fails i'll be fine i can
06:56 - always go back and post youtube videos i
06:58 - can always live off savings and passive
07:00 - income
07:01 - fortunately in a position where i don't
07:02 - need to be making tons of money right
07:04 - now and that was kind of my mindset in
07:07 - terms of of doing this so i'd love to
07:09 - hear what you guys think in the comments
07:11 - down below again a massive thank you to
07:13 - all of you for helping me reach 1
07:15 - million subscribers i know it does seem
07:17 - a bit weird that once i hit this massive
07:19 - milestone i'm kind of taking a break and
07:20 - moving a bit away from it but for me it
07:23 - just feels like a really good point to
07:24 - kind of transition shift a little bit
07:27 - and move into something again that's
07:28 - very exciting and that i've been a lot
07:30 - more motivated to work towards as
07:32 - opposed to just kind of doing a very
07:34 - similar thing that i've been doing for
07:35 - the past few years so hopefully you guys
07:37 - enjoyed this content i know it's a bit
07:39 - different than what i usually post but i
07:40 - just wanted to be real with you talk to
07:42 - you about where my head is at and kind
07:44 - of what's going to be going on in the
07:45 - future if you do have any content ideas
07:47 - for me stuff you'd like to see kind of
07:49 - once a week a few times a month leave
07:51 - that down below and with that said i
07:53 - hope to see you in another youtube video
07:57 - [Music]
08:03 - you
