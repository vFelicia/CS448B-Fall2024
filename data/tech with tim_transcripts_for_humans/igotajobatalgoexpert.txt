00:05 - 10 whatever minutes into the video i
00:07 - will tell you right now
00:08 - the news is true this is not just a
00:10 - click bait title i
00:11 - am indeed working for algo expert now
00:13 - i'll get into all of the details about
00:15 - that and what i'm doing for algo expert
00:17 - and kind of some important announcements
00:19 - and big releases that are going to be
00:20 - happening on that platform
00:22 - but i want to tell you about what this
00:23 - video is really going to be about
00:25 - in this video i'm going to talk to you
00:26 - about what my life is
00:28 - like and what i actually do on a
00:30 - day-to-day basis because a lot of you
00:32 - just see this youtube channel
00:34 - you just see all the hard work i put
00:35 - into these videos but i also
00:37 - am a full-time student currently i'm
00:39 - going to be working for algo expert
00:41 - which is a
00:41 - pretty full-time job there's a lot of
00:43 - stuff that i need to do of course i run
00:45 - this youtube channel and all of the
00:46 - business stuff related to that and then
00:48 - i do a few other things as well that i
00:50 - want to mention
00:50 - in this video so anyways sit back relax
00:53 - and i'm going to give you kind of an
00:54 - inside scoop
00:55 - into my life and talk about what i've
00:57 - been doing for the past year and kind of
00:58 - what my plans are for this channel
01:00 - and going forward over the next few
01:05 - [Music]
01:10 - so i'm not going to make you guys wait
01:12 - to hear the exciting news or what the
01:13 - title of this video
01:14 - is about tech with tim is officially
01:17 - partnering with
01:18 - algo expert now what i mean by
01:20 - partnering is we're actually going to be
01:21 - working together in some different
01:23 - capacities
01:24 - we'll talk to you about both of them but
01:25 - the first thing that i'm going to be
01:27 - doing is i'm actually going to be
01:28 - working
01:29 - for algo expert as an algorithms
01:31 - instructor
01:32 - now if you're not sure what algo expert
01:34 - is let me just give you kind of a quick
01:35 - brief of it so you understand the
01:36 - context here
01:37 - algo expert is a coding interview prep
01:40 - platform that is designed for people
01:42 - that want to become software engineers
01:43 - or pass their technical coding
01:45 - interviews
01:45 - to be able to do so this is the platform
01:48 - that i use to actually prepare for my
01:50 - microsoft interviews as well as my
01:51 - shopify interviews and a few others and
01:53 - while it is genuinely the reason that i
01:56 - was able to get a job at some of these
01:57 - big
01:58 - tech companies especially at 19 which is
02:00 - a lot younger than most of the other
02:02 - interns that were coming
02:03 - in the main selling points for me of the
02:05 - platform at least the reason why i used
02:07 - it when i was preparing for my
02:08 - interviews
02:08 - is that it has really high quality
02:10 - coding interview questions so practice
02:12 - questions that you can do
02:14 - it has a full online ide you can run
02:16 - your code against test cases
02:18 - and you can also see full video
02:21 - explanations
02:22 - for every single question now yes you
02:24 - can go and find coding interview
02:25 - questions
02:26 - anywhere on the internet but the reason
02:28 - why i'm going to be working for algo
02:29 - expert and why i'm happy to promote them
02:31 - and i actually use them myself
02:33 - is because their video explanations are
02:35 - super valuable
02:36 - there's a conceptual overview for every
02:38 - single question that explains to you how
02:40 - to approach the problem
02:41 - kind of the different solutions and
02:43 - avenues that you could go down and how
02:44 - to explain that to your interviewer
02:46 - and then there is a code walk through at
02:48 - the end that actually shows you
02:49 - how to transcribe this kind of
02:51 - theoretical solution into real code that
02:53 - actually passes those test cases
02:55 - so that's pretty much what algo expert
02:57 - is and what i'm going to be doing again
02:58 - to repeat is actually
03:00 - creating unique coding interview
03:02 - questions so as of now there should be a
03:04 - hundred and ten questions on the algo
03:06 - expert platform if you're watching this
03:08 - video right when it goes live
03:09 - and five of those questions are ones
03:11 - that i have come up with or that i have
03:13 - created
03:14 - so i am the one doing the video
03:15 - explanation i'm the one who wrote the
03:17 - prompt and came up with the solution
03:19 - and well that's what i'm going to be
03:20 - doing for the platform now another thing
03:22 - to mention here is that two of the main
03:24 - people that i'm going to be working with
03:25 - both have youtube channels and you
03:27 - probably know who both of them are
03:29 - the first one is clement he has his own
03:31 - youtube channel that really just talks
03:33 - about algo expert all the time
03:35 - and his entrepreneurial kind of career
03:37 - in software engineering and all of that
03:38 - he is the co-founder of this platform
03:40 - and also happens to be a good friend of
03:42 - mine that i met uh probably about a year
03:44 - ago from this point in time
03:46 - and then another person that i'm going
03:47 - to be working with his name is nick
03:49 - white you guys might know him he's on
03:50 - youtube as well
03:51 - and he is the other algorithms
03:53 - instructor that was recently brought on
03:55 - by algo expert so they both have awesome
03:58 - youtube channels i will leave the links
04:00 - down below but you would have seen
04:01 - clement on my channel i've done a bunch
04:03 - of collaborations with him and we've
04:04 - just really been good friends and talked
04:06 - a lot
04:06 - since we met about a year ago and did
04:08 - our first collaboration video
04:10 - two of them were on this channel and
04:11 - then we did one on clemence channel
04:13 - which was actually a
04:14 - mock google coding interview which you
04:15 - can find kind of a reaction version of
04:17 - on
04:18 - this channel as well so that is the
04:19 - first way in which i am working with
04:21 - algo expert and with clement
04:23 - again really excited about this and the
04:26 - next way that i'm going to be working
04:27 - with algoexpert is that they are
04:29 - actually going to be a main
04:30 - sponsor of this youtube channel now you
04:32 - may have already noticed this and you
04:34 - may have already seen in some of my
04:35 - videos that algo expert was the sponsor
04:38 - but from now going forward they are
04:40 - planning on sponsoring a bunch of videos
04:41 - and specifically the tutorial ones
04:43 - and i just want to be really transparent
04:45 - with you guys on this because i am
04:46 - working for the company
04:48 - and of course they are a sponsor and for
04:50 - me this is a really good synergy this
04:52 - works really well and i'm super happy to
04:54 - promote algo expert
04:55 - because as i've said many times
04:57 - genuinely it's a great platform i
04:59 - wouldn't be working for it or allowing
05:01 - it to be sponsoring this video if i
05:02 - didn't think so
05:03 - and i just think this is going to work
05:04 - out really well and i'm really excited
05:06 - about kind of these advancements and
05:07 - what's happening with this channel and
05:09 - what i'm going to be able to do in terms
05:11 - of making questions on the platform
05:13 - now full disclaimer algo expert is also
05:14 - the sponsor of this video right now
05:16 - which means i need to tell you to go to
05:18 - the description
05:19 - and check out the link to algo expert
05:21 - you can use the code tech with tim
05:22 - for a discount on the platform hopefully
05:25 - i've given you enough of a sales pitch
05:27 - by me explaining what the platform is
05:28 - and what i'm gonna be doing for it but
05:30 - at minimum
05:30 - i'm gonna be working there so you know
05:32 - there's gonna be some high quality
05:34 - coding explanations and coding questions
05:36 - on the platform
05:37 - anyways that is kind of the first piece
05:39 - of big news that i wanted to share with
05:41 - you that i'm teaming up with algo expert
05:43 - they're going to be sponsoring a bunch
05:44 - of videos on this channel and i'll be
05:46 - working alongside clement
05:47 - and nick and making coding questions on
05:49 - the platform you'll be seeing regular
05:51 - releases of those questions kind of
05:53 - throughout the months as i finish them
05:55 - and as different batches of them are
05:56 - uploaded so i do apologize that was a
05:58 - long
05:59 - section but my honest intentions are
06:01 - just to be as open and transparent with
06:03 - you guys as possible
06:04 - i want you to know what i'm up to i want
06:05 - you to know why there's algo expert
06:07 - sponsored videos and you're seeing me on
06:08 - the platform well i'd rather give you
06:10 - more information and take more time in
06:12 - the video
06:12 - than give you less and have you guys
06:14 - asking questions and wondering about my
06:15 - intentions and all those different
06:17 - things
06:17 - genuinely i think this is going to be a
06:19 - really positive development for the
06:21 - channel and just for myself personally
06:23 - and i hope you guys are as excited about
06:24 - it or excited for me as
06:26 - i am now with that said let's talk about
06:29 - this channel because i'm sure you guys
06:30 - care more about that
06:32 - so this channel is not going anywhere
06:34 - the uploads are not going to be any less
06:35 - frequent and if anything there's going
06:37 - to be even more effort put into the
06:39 - videos here
06:40 - i hope you guys have realized that at
06:41 - this point i'm investing a significant
06:43 - amount of money into this channel
06:45 - i'll be transparent that this is a
06:46 - business it does generate a good amount
06:48 - of revenue and that's why i'm able to
06:50 - kind of justify the time commitment that
06:52 - i put into it
06:53 - but i also am reinvesting constantly and
06:55 - i'm trying to make my youtube videos
06:57 - genuinely be the best tutorial videos on
07:00 - the planet that is my goal and
07:02 - that might seem ambitious but without a
07:03 - goal that high there's no way that i'm
07:05 - going to get better and improve my
07:06 - videos
07:07 - beyond the current quality that they're
07:09 - at so hopefully you've noticed i've
07:10 - hired out a full editing team
07:12 - they're doing my thumbnails they're
07:13 - doing my videos just small things i've
07:15 - added just like some a little bit better
07:17 - branding i changed my logo that was a
07:19 - while ago but still
07:20 - and i added end screens introductions
07:22 - i'm doing all kinds of new tutorial
07:23 - series that i never really would have
07:25 - imagined doing like this full react web
07:27 - app
07:27 - and i really do see this channel going
07:29 - quite far i don't plan on stopping it
07:31 - anytime in the foreseeable future and if
07:34 - you guys are here
07:35 - just know that there's gonna be lots
07:36 - more videos and i'm listening to you i'm
07:38 - reading pretty much
07:39 - all of your comments and i'm trying my
07:41 - best to accommodate and change my
07:43 - content around what you guys want to see
07:45 - now at this point in time this channel
07:47 - is pretty big we're almost at half a
07:49 - million subscribers
07:50 - that's got to be one of the larger tech
07:52 - channels in the space and i just want to
07:54 - say a big thank you to all of you guys
07:56 - you have made this possible you've made
07:58 - me at 20 years old be able to be
08:00 - successful on my own doing this stuff
08:02 - and genuinely wake up every single
08:04 - morning with a smile on my face because
08:05 - i get to do something that i like
08:07 - and something that helps genuinely
08:09 - millions of people learn how to code
08:12 - it's just a great opportunity and thank
08:14 - you guys so much i'm not going to let
08:15 - you down
08:16 - this channel is going to continue to
08:17 - grow into the millions of subscribers
08:19 - and i have big plans and a lot of things
08:21 - that i want to do
08:22 - now that leads me into some exciting
08:24 - kind of advancements and things that are
08:25 - going on
08:26 - first of all if you're not in my discord
08:28 - server you seriously need to join that
08:30 - that is where a lot of kind of say the
08:32 - die hard fans are quote unquote and a
08:34 - lot of events and things are going on
08:36 - like giveaways we have code jams we have
08:38 - coding competitions and we're planning
08:40 - on actually developing a
08:41 - minecraft server that's going to have
08:43 - all custom plugins
08:44 - and a bunch of really cool stuff all of
08:46 - that stuff is happening in
08:48 - the discord server so just to give you
08:50 - kind of some concrete things that are
08:51 - coming up in the future
08:52 - as of january this year i'm actually
08:55 - going to be taking a four-month break
08:57 - from school now i feel like this is
08:59 - pretty obvious why i'm doing this i have
09:00 - a lot of other things that i'm gonna do
09:02 - and there's actually never been a point
09:04 - in my life where i haven't
09:05 - been doing something else full time and
09:08 - having youtube on the side
09:09 - believe it or not youtube has always
09:11 - been a second priority it's always been
09:13 - something that's been
09:14 - quote unquote a side hustle even when i
09:17 - was younger i was working full-time jobs
09:18 - in the summer and making the youtube
09:20 - channel i've been a full-time student
09:22 - doing the youtube channel i worked at
09:23 - microsoft in the summer doing the
09:25 - youtube channel
09:26 - never once have i had time to just focus
09:28 - on this and now with the addition of the
09:29 - algo expert work
09:30 - i decided taking four months off isn't a
09:33 - bad idea and it's going to let me really
09:34 - build a strong infrastructure
09:36 - and just get this channel ready to go
09:38 - and ready to grow to the numbers that
09:40 - i want it to be at so anyways some
09:42 - things that are coming up we're going to
09:43 - have a big
09:44 - tech with tim minecraft server now i'm
09:46 - really excited about this
09:47 - i may actually potentially start a game
09:49 - with tim channel just something fun
09:51 - where i kind of do live streams and
09:52 - actually play on the minecraft server
09:54 - some of you guys have been asking me
09:56 - about my podcast i would really like to
09:58 - start that up and
09:59 - expect in the future that's going to be
10:01 - a more full-time thing right now i just
10:03 - have so many other things in my life
10:04 - that i can't justify the time to do that
10:06 - but that is something that i'm thinking
10:08 - about i'm hearing you guys and i really
10:10 - want to start the podcast channel up
10:11 - again
10:12 - other than that i have a bunch of really
10:13 - cool series coming out i've started to
10:15 - work with javascript you've seen this
10:17 - recent one with react and django
10:19 - and whatever you guys are asking me to
10:21 - do chances are i'm probably going to do
10:23 - it so leave a comment with what you want
10:24 - to see
10:25 - but i have big plans for this channel
10:27 - big plans for a bunch of other things
10:29 - that i want to do
10:30 - and all i'm saying is don't expect me to
10:31 - go anywhere even though i'm working for
10:33 - algo expert this channel will always be
10:35 - a huge part of my life and while i'm so
10:37 - happy that i'm able to run this and
10:39 - again just
10:39 - a genuine massive thank you to all of
10:42 - you now i want to leave you guys with
10:43 - one last thing before i
10:45 - end this video and i just want to talk
10:47 - to you about how i've
10:48 - really been able to accomplish all of
10:50 - this now i don't want to come across as
10:51 - cocky or arrogant or anything like that
10:54 - just realistically i've done a lot at 20
10:56 - years old and a lot of people ask me how
10:58 - do you do this how do you find the time
10:59 - for this
11:00 - and all i'm gonna say is that it all
11:02 - comes down to mindset
11:03 - i am not some bill gates or mark
11:05 - zuckerberg whatever you guys might call
11:07 - me i genuinely promise you that i'm a
11:09 - pretty normal dude and if you met me in
11:10 - real life you probably wouldn't assume
11:12 - that
11:12 - i do all this kind of stuff but the
11:14 - reason i've been able to accomplish it
11:16 - is because of the mindset that i adopt
11:18 - which is getting better
11:19 - every single day go watch my first
11:22 - videos go look at the stuff i did
11:24 - even one year ago and you will notice a
11:26 - dramatic difference i do not aim for
11:28 - perfection i just aim to beat myself and
11:31 - get better every single day
11:32 - i don't care about the other coding
11:34 - channels i don't care about what other
11:35 - people are doing
11:36 - i care about what i'm doing and doing a
11:38 - better job than i did yesterday and
11:40 - that's how i've been able to grow this
11:41 - youtube channel
11:42 - and have the success that i've had at 20
11:45 - years old so i hope that doesn't come
11:46 - across the wrong way
11:47 - it's just genuinely something i wanted
11:49 - to share with you and if you can adopt a
11:51 - similar mindset to that and just
11:52 - be committed to getting better and doing
11:54 - more every day then you'll have no
11:56 - problem surpassing everything that i've
11:58 - even been able to do
11:59 - so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
12:01 - it gave you a little bit of insight
12:02 - maybe even some motivation
12:04 - with that said i hope to see you again
12:06 - in another youtube video
12:11 - [Music]
12:15 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so i'm not going to make you wait for 5 10 whatever minutes into the video i will tell you right now the news is true this is not just a click bait title i am indeed working for algo expert now i'll get into all of the details about that and what i'm doing for algo expert and kind of some important announcements and big releases that are going to be happening on that platform but i want to tell you about what this video is really going to be about in this video i'm going to talk to you about what my life is like and what i actually do on a daytoday basis because a lot of you just see this youtube channel you just see all the hard work i put into these videos but i also am a fulltime student currently i'm going to be working for algo expert which is a pretty fulltime job there's a lot of stuff that i need to do of course i run this youtube channel and all of the business stuff related to that and then i do a few other things as well that i want to mention in this video so anyways sit back relax and i'm going to give you kind of an inside scoop into my life and talk about what i've been doing for the past year and kind of what my plans are for this channel and going forward over the next few so i'm not going to make you guys wait to hear the exciting news or what the title of this video is about tech with tim is officially partnering with algo expert now what i mean by partnering is we're actually going to be working together in some different capacities we'll talk to you about both of them but the first thing that i'm going to be doing is i'm actually going to be working for algo expert as an algorithms instructor now if you're not sure what algo expert is let me just give you kind of a quick brief of it so you understand the context here algo expert is a coding interview prep platform that is designed for people that want to become software engineers or pass their technical coding interviews to be able to do so this is the platform that i use to actually prepare for my microsoft interviews as well as my shopify interviews and a few others and while it is genuinely the reason that i was able to get a job at some of these big tech companies especially at 19 which is a lot younger than most of the other interns that were coming in the main selling points for me of the platform at least the reason why i used it when i was preparing for my interviews is that it has really high quality coding interview questions so practice questions that you can do it has a full online ide you can run your code against test cases and you can also see full video explanations for every single question now yes you can go and find coding interview questions anywhere on the internet but the reason why i'm going to be working for algo expert and why i'm happy to promote them and i actually use them myself is because their video explanations are super valuable there's a conceptual overview for every single question that explains to you how to approach the problem kind of the different solutions and avenues that you could go down and how to explain that to your interviewer and then there is a code walk through at the end that actually shows you how to transcribe this kind of theoretical solution into real code that actually passes those test cases so that's pretty much what algo expert is and what i'm going to be doing again to repeat is actually creating unique coding interview questions so as of now there should be a hundred and ten questions on the algo expert platform if you're watching this video right when it goes live and five of those questions are ones that i have come up with or that i have created so i am the one doing the video explanation i'm the one who wrote the prompt and came up with the solution and well that's what i'm going to be doing for the platform now another thing to mention here is that two of the main people that i'm going to be working with both have youtube channels and you probably know who both of them are the first one is clement he has his own youtube channel that really just talks about algo expert all the time and his entrepreneurial kind of career in software engineering and all of that he is the cofounder of this platform and also happens to be a good friend of mine that i met uh probably about a year ago from this point in time and then another person that i'm going to be working with his name is nick white you guys might know him he's on youtube as well and he is the other algorithms instructor that was recently brought on by algo expert so they both have awesome youtube channels i will leave the links down below but you would have seen clement on my channel i've done a bunch of collaborations with him and we've just really been good friends and talked a lot since we met about a year ago and did our first collaboration video two of them were on this channel and then we did one on clemence channel which was actually a mock google coding interview which you can find kind of a reaction version of on this channel as well so that is the first way in which i am working with algo expert and with clement again really excited about this and the next way that i'm going to be working with algoexpert is that they are actually going to be a main sponsor of this youtube channel now you may have already noticed this and you may have already seen in some of my videos that algo expert was the sponsor but from now going forward they are planning on sponsoring a bunch of videos and specifically the tutorial ones and i just want to be really transparent with you guys on this because i am working for the company and of course they are a sponsor and for me this is a really good synergy this works really well and i'm super happy to promote algo expert because as i've said many times genuinely it's a great platform i wouldn't be working for it or allowing it to be sponsoring this video if i didn't think so and i just think this is going to work out really well and i'm really excited about kind of these advancements and what's happening with this channel and what i'm going to be able to do in terms of making questions on the platform now full disclaimer algo expert is also the sponsor of this video right now which means i need to tell you to go to the description and check out the link to algo expert you can use the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform hopefully i've given you enough of a sales pitch by me explaining what the platform is and what i'm gonna be doing for it but at minimum i'm gonna be working there so you know there's gonna be some high quality coding explanations and coding questions on the platform anyways that is kind of the first piece of big news that i wanted to share with you that i'm teaming up with algo expert they're going to be sponsoring a bunch of videos on this channel and i'll be working alongside clement and nick and making coding questions on the platform you'll be seeing regular releases of those questions kind of throughout the months as i finish them and as different batches of them are uploaded so i do apologize that was a long section but my honest intentions are just to be as open and transparent with you guys as possible i want you to know what i'm up to i want you to know why there's algo expert sponsored videos and you're seeing me on the platform well i'd rather give you more information and take more time in the video than give you less and have you guys asking questions and wondering about my intentions and all those different things genuinely i think this is going to be a really positive development for the channel and just for myself personally and i hope you guys are as excited about it or excited for me as i am now with that said let's talk about this channel because i'm sure you guys care more about that so this channel is not going anywhere the uploads are not going to be any less frequent and if anything there's going to be even more effort put into the videos here i hope you guys have realized that at this point i'm investing a significant amount of money into this channel i'll be transparent that this is a business it does generate a good amount of revenue and that's why i'm able to kind of justify the time commitment that i put into it but i also am reinvesting constantly and i'm trying to make my youtube videos genuinely be the best tutorial videos on the planet that is my goal and that might seem ambitious but without a goal that high there's no way that i'm going to get better and improve my videos beyond the current quality that they're at so hopefully you've noticed i've hired out a full editing team they're doing my thumbnails they're doing my videos just small things i've added just like some a little bit better branding i changed my logo that was a while ago but still and i added end screens introductions i'm doing all kinds of new tutorial series that i never really would have imagined doing like this full react web app and i really do see this channel going quite far i don't plan on stopping it anytime in the foreseeable future and if you guys are here just know that there's gonna be lots more videos and i'm listening to you i'm reading pretty much all of your comments and i'm trying my best to accommodate and change my content around what you guys want to see now at this point in time this channel is pretty big we're almost at half a million subscribers that's got to be one of the larger tech channels in the space and i just want to say a big thank you to all of you guys you have made this possible you've made me at 20 years old be able to be successful on my own doing this stuff and genuinely wake up every single morning with a smile on my face because i get to do something that i like and something that helps genuinely millions of people learn how to code it's just a great opportunity and thank you guys so much i'm not going to let you down this channel is going to continue to grow into the millions of subscribers and i have big plans and a lot of things that i want to do now that leads me into some exciting kind of advancements and things that are going on first of all if you're not in my discord server you seriously need to join that that is where a lot of kind of say the die hard fans are quote unquote and a lot of events and things are going on like giveaways we have code jams we have coding competitions and we're planning on actually developing a minecraft server that's going to have all custom plugins and a bunch of really cool stuff all of that stuff is happening in the discord server so just to give you kind of some concrete things that are coming up in the future as of january this year i'm actually going to be taking a fourmonth break from school now i feel like this is pretty obvious why i'm doing this i have a lot of other things that i'm gonna do and there's actually never been a point in my life where i haven't been doing something else full time and having youtube on the side believe it or not youtube has always been a second priority it's always been something that's been quote unquote a side hustle even when i was younger i was working fulltime jobs in the summer and making the youtube channel i've been a fulltime student doing the youtube channel i worked at microsoft in the summer doing the youtube channel never once have i had time to just focus on this and now with the addition of the algo expert work i decided taking four months off isn't a bad idea and it's going to let me really build a strong infrastructure and just get this channel ready to go and ready to grow to the numbers that i want it to be at so anyways some things that are coming up we're going to have a big tech with tim minecraft server now i'm really excited about this i may actually potentially start a game with tim channel just something fun where i kind of do live streams and actually play on the minecraft server some of you guys have been asking me about my podcast i would really like to start that up and expect in the future that's going to be a more fulltime thing right now i just have so many other things in my life that i can't justify the time to do that but that is something that i'm thinking about i'm hearing you guys and i really want to start the podcast channel up again other than that i have a bunch of really cool series coming out i've started to work with javascript you've seen this recent one with react and django and whatever you guys are asking me to do chances are i'm probably going to do it so leave a comment with what you want to see but i have big plans for this channel big plans for a bunch of other things that i want to do and all i'm saying is don't expect me to go anywhere even though i'm working for algo expert this channel will always be a huge part of my life and while i'm so happy that i'm able to run this and again just a genuine massive thank you to all of you now i want to leave you guys with one last thing before i end this video and i just want to talk to you about how i've really been able to accomplish all of this now i don't want to come across as cocky or arrogant or anything like that just realistically i've done a lot at 20 years old and a lot of people ask me how do you do this how do you find the time for this and all i'm gonna say is that it all comes down to mindset i am not some bill gates or mark zuckerberg whatever you guys might call me i genuinely promise you that i'm a pretty normal dude and if you met me in real life you probably wouldn't assume that i do all this kind of stuff but the reason i've been able to accomplish it is because of the mindset that i adopt which is getting better every single day go watch my first videos go look at the stuff i did even one year ago and you will notice a dramatic difference i do not aim for perfection i just aim to beat myself and get better every single day i don't care about the other coding channels i don't care about what other people are doing i care about what i'm doing and doing a better job than i did yesterday and that's how i've been able to grow this youtube channel and have the success that i've had at 20 years old so i hope that doesn't come across the wrong way it's just genuinely something i wanted to share with you and if you can adopt a similar mindset to that and just be committed to getting better and doing more every day then you'll have no problem surpassing everything that i've even been able to do so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video it gave you a little bit of insight maybe even some motivation with that said i hope to see you again in another youtube video you
