00:00 - in python there's a useful function that
00:01 - nominee people know about called all now
00:04 - what all does is tell you if all of the
00:06 - values in an iterable are true let's
00:08 - have a look at how this works if i print
00:11 - out all on my first example which is lst
00:13 - c we get false the reason we get false
00:15 - is because zero is interpreted as false
00:17 - in python let's try an example two lst
00:20 - two we get false as well clearly there's
00:22 - no true values in this list let's go to
00:24 - lst of three we get true the reason we
00:26 - get true is any string that has content
00:29 - inside of it is considered true in
00:30 - python clearly true is true as well and
00:33 - then let's look at our last example
00:34 - which is on the tuple notice that we get
00:37 - false because the false is present if i
00:39 - were to change this to true then we
00:41 - would get true hopefully you found this
00:43 - helpful if you did follow for more
