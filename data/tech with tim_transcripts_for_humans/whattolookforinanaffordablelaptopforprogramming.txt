00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:02 - youtube video
00:03 - so in today's video i'm gonna be walking
00:05 - you through my buying guide for a
00:06 - programming laptop
00:08 - now i get asked the question all the
00:09 - time is four gigs of ram enough it's
00:11 - eight gigs of ram enough do i need an i5
00:13 - do i need an i7
00:15 - and so in this video i'm going to focus
00:16 - heavily on the specs of a computer
00:19 - and just kind of what you should look
00:20 - for in terms of specs and features in
00:22 - any laptop that you're going to buy
00:23 - for programming so i'm going to start
00:25 - with the bare minimum requirements
00:27 - the absolute minimum i would recommend
00:30 - for any device that you're going to use
00:31 - for programming
00:32 - then i'll give you kind of my
00:33 - recommended configuration for a decent
00:35 - experience
00:36 - i'll talk about some nice to have
00:38 - features and then we'll get in and talk
00:39 - about some specific exceptions so say
00:41 - you're working with you know 3d
00:43 - games you're doing ios apps what kind of
00:45 - machines you might need for that
00:46 - and finally i'll end off by just walking
00:48 - through a few laptops that look good to
00:50 - me that i would personally recommend
00:52 - so that being said let's go ahead and
00:53 - get started and talk about what you
00:55 - should look for in a programming laptop
01:00 - [Music]
01:05 - so i'm going to get started by
01:06 - discussing the bare minimum requirements
01:09 - that i would recommend for a programming
01:10 - laptop
01:11 - of course you could go lower than these
01:13 - if you're really on a budget
01:15 - but i would personally recommend saving
01:16 - up until you can buy a device that has
01:18 - these kind of specs
01:19 - just because your experience is going to
01:21 - be much better and you're going to be
01:22 - using that really cheap device maybe for
01:24 - a year or two before you decide
01:26 - to upgrade anyways when all of the new
01:28 - software can no longer run on it
01:30 - anyways let me go through the specs so
01:32 - starting with system memory i'm gonna
01:34 - recommend you have at least
01:35 - four gigabytes of system ram this is
01:37 - because a lot of programs require at
01:40 - minimum four gigabytes of ram to run
01:42 - and if you want to run multiple programs
01:44 - at the same time without having them be
01:46 - drastically slower than they usually
01:48 - would be
01:48 - you're gonna want four gigs of ram even
01:51 - in today's age that's a little bit low
01:52 - but for some basic
01:54 - programming tasks that's totally fine
01:56 - and four gigs should be fine
01:58 - next i'm going to recommend you get a
01:59 - quad core processor
02:01 - so this is going to bring the price up
02:03 - on the computer that you're going to be
02:04 - purchasing it's going to push it you
02:06 - know over a few hundred dollars probably
02:08 - but buying something like a pentium or
02:10 - celeron processor which are dual core
02:12 - processors
02:13 - they're just gonna be very slow and for
02:15 - programming it's just not gonna be a
02:17 - good experience whatsoever
02:18 - i'd highly recommend saving up to get a
02:21 - quad core processor
02:22 - something like an i3 or an i3 equivalent
02:25 - on the amd side i'm not quite sure
02:26 - exactly what that model number
02:28 - would be after that i would recommend
02:30 - having about 120 gigabytes of disk space
02:33 - yes you could go with something like 60
02:35 - gigs disk space but there is some quite
02:37 - large packages and
02:38 - applications when you're programming and
02:40 - combined with say a windows install or a
02:42 - linux installer whatever operating
02:44 - system it is
02:45 - you're going to be running out of
02:46 - storage quite quickly if you don't have
02:47 - at least 100 gigabytes
02:49 - after that we're going to be talking
02:50 - about operating system
02:52 - what you're going to want to look for
02:53 - typically is windows mac or linux
02:56 - those are kind of the three options you
02:57 - have yes you could use something like
03:00 - ios so you could buy maybe a cheap
03:02 - mobile phone
03:03 - and try to use that for programming or
03:05 - maybe an ipad or a tablet or something
03:07 - like that
03:08 - but you're going to be highly limited to
03:09 - what you can download what programs you
03:11 - can use and what code you can run
03:14 - if you don't get one of those three
03:15 - mentioned operating systems
03:17 - another thing to be careful with is look
03:19 - out for devices that are running
03:20 - running windows s mode that is kind of
03:23 - like the mobile version of windows
03:25 - it comes with a lot less features than
03:27 - your standard windows
03:28 - and only allows you to download things
03:30 - from the windows store
03:32 - you can turn off windows s mode and put
03:35 - it to a full-fledged windows install
03:37 - but that uses a lot more system
03:39 - resources is going to be very slow
03:41 - on that device if it's meant to run
03:43 - windows s mode so personally i would
03:45 - recommend going with linux
03:47 - if you are comfortable with that
03:48 - operating system something like ubuntu
03:50 - is really easy to get used to if you're
03:52 - not coming from a linux background
03:54 - and it will be much faster on a device
03:56 - like this
03:57 - so that's kind of what i'm recommending
03:59 - for the bare minimum essentials
04:01 - of course if you can't afford that you
04:03 - can definitely code simply using any
04:05 - kind of web browser
04:06 - so whatever device you have if it has a
04:08 - web browser you can write code
04:10 - and you can actually start learning and
04:12 - experimenting and that's totally fine
04:13 - but to start doing anything
04:14 - locally you're going to want the specs
04:16 - that i just mentioned
04:18 - so i'm going to quickly list three
04:19 - websites here that i think you should
04:21 - consider
04:21 - if you're someone who has a lower end
04:23 - machine or just want to experiment with
04:25 - coding and don't want to worry about
04:26 - installing and downloading
04:28 - anything first one is called replit this
04:30 - is a browser-based ide so repl
04:33 - it totally free you can write and test
04:36 - code in the cloud
04:37 - next one is google collaboratory this is
04:39 - specifically for python users but you
04:42 - can actually run a jupyter notebook and
04:44 - execute that in the cloud with hardware
04:46 - acceleration as all
04:47 - as well for free so that's like having
04:50 - access to a gpu
04:51 - to train a machine learning model or
04:53 - something like that and then finally
04:54 - there's vs code code
04:56 - spaces i actually don't know how new
04:58 - this is and how accessible it is
05:00 - but i do know that this is visual studio
05:02 - code in the cloud
05:04 - and that essentially means you can use a
05:06 - full-fledged code editor
05:07 - on the cloud on another device totally
05:10 - for free so check those three things out
05:12 - if you have a lower tier machine
05:13 - or you're just looking to kind of get
05:14 - started without needing to download
05:16 - install and set everything up on your
05:18 - own machine
05:19 - so now time for my recommendation for
05:21 - kind of a decent pc
05:22 - that's going to give you a good
05:23 - experience that's not going to be super
05:25 - fast but it's definitely not going to be
05:27 - slow and it's going to be able to
05:28 - achieve kind of all the programming
05:29 - stuff that you want
05:31 - so i'll start by recommending eight
05:32 - gigabytes of system memory
05:34 - you really don't need any more than this
05:36 - eight gigabytes is plenty when you're
05:38 - doing programming
05:39 - and i personally can't think of many
05:41 - situations where i've been doing some
05:43 - kind of programming stuff and needed
05:44 - more than eight gigabytes of memory
05:46 - now of course if you're doing something
05:48 - with machine learning loading large data
05:50 - sets
05:50 - where you want just a ton of different
05:52 - things open at once maybe you're running
05:53 - like three instances of android studio
05:56 - then you might want some more system
05:58 - memory but eight gigabytes is enough you
05:59 - definitely do not need
06:01 - more then i would recommend a i5
06:04 - processor or higher you also probably
06:06 - could get away with an i3
06:08 - but sticking with kind of the last
06:09 - recommendation just a quad core
06:11 - processor
06:12 - something modern and something that's
06:13 - just going to be kind of fast right
06:15 - that's what we're looking for so an i5
06:17 - equivalent
06:18 - or an i5 i don't know what all the amd
06:20 - model numbers are otherwise i would list
06:22 - them
06:22 - next you're going to want to go with
06:24 - probably about 250 gigabytes of storage
06:27 - or more again really depends on what
06:29 - you're going to be using this for and
06:31 - how much you're going to be downloading
06:32 - but i feel like 250 gigs is enough for
06:35 - most people
06:36 - if you have a ton of different
06:37 - applications you might want to go up to
06:39 - 500 gigabytes
06:40 - and a nice feature to look for here
06:41 - would be an ssd so not all computers
06:44 - come with ssds i know it's much more
06:46 - common now
06:47 - but looking for some kind of ssd just
06:49 - means your storage is going to be a
06:50 - little bit faster
06:51 - and that's just going to make for a
06:52 - better experience especially kind of in
06:54 - your day-to-day use on the operating
06:55 - system loading things up moving files
06:57 - around
06:58 - so on i also like to mention here to
07:00 - look for stuff that has a usbc port
07:02 - this is kind of a newer port i guess but
07:05 - this is
07:06 - pretty important if you want to think
07:07 - about future proofing your device a lot
07:09 - of the accessories that are coming out
07:11 - now are usbc
07:12 - of course you could dongle stuff but
07:14 - it's just nice to have a really fast
07:15 - port on the computer
07:17 - and i always recommend people look out
07:18 - for usbc
07:20 - next i would recommend that you look for
07:22 - something that has a
07:23 - large screen if this is going to be the
07:26 - only device you use
07:27 - so if you don't have a desktop at home
07:29 - if you're not planning on plugging in an
07:30 - external monitor
07:31 - i'd really recommend you go with
07:33 - something that's 14 inches or larger
07:35 - yes you can go with the 12 inch screens
07:37 - or the 11 inch screens
07:38 - but i find programming at least for
07:40 - myself if i want to have multiple things
07:42 - open on the screen it's really nice to
07:44 - have that extra inch or two of screen
07:46 - screen real estate especially when
07:48 - you're scrolling through large code
07:49 - files
07:49 - i find it can actually make you a bit
07:51 - more efficient and of course it's just
07:52 - nicer to have that extra bit of space
07:54 - so i always recommend that and then of
07:57 - course you're going to want to look for
07:58 - a decent keyboard on the laptop
08:00 - of course if you're working at home you
08:02 - know you can plug into a monitor you can
08:04 - buy an external keyboard and mouse and
08:05 - you can just use the laptop
08:07 - but if this is going to be something
08:08 - where you're on the go all the time
08:10 - you're actually using the laptop
08:11 - keyboard
08:12 - look for something that you're going to
08:13 - enjoy typing on i know i've heard that
08:15 - lenovo has a really good keyboard
08:17 - and i've had a lenovo laptop that i've
08:19 - used and i can definitely say it's
08:20 - probably the best keyboard i've seen
08:22 - on a laptop other than that that's
08:24 - really all you're looking for for
08:26 - a laptop for programming there's nothing
08:28 - special that you need you don't need a
08:30 - graphics card just eight gigs of ram
08:32 - modern processor enough storage big
08:35 - screen and a nice keyboard that's really
08:37 - what you're looking for
08:38 - you can get all of that for probably
08:40 - under 800.
08:41 - so that is kind of my recommendation for
08:43 - the mid-tier um you know
08:45 - mid-tier programming laptop no you're
08:47 - not going to be able to game a ton on
08:49 - this um you know it's not going to be
08:50 - the best thing ever but for programming
08:52 - that's really all you need
08:54 - now last thing i'll say here if you're
08:55 - looking for something that's a bit
08:57 - better kind of some nice to have
08:58 - features maybe you've got an extra few
08:59 - hundred bucks in the budget
09:01 - looking for something that has a lower
09:02 - end graphics card maybe with two
09:04 - gigabytes of video memory or four
09:06 - gigabytes
09:06 - will definitely be great if you want to
09:08 - do something like a little bit of video
09:10 - editing
09:10 - content creation maybe you want to play
09:13 - a few video games whatever it may be
09:14 - having some kind of dedicated graphics
09:16 - card is going to be a great investment
09:19 - and it just you know something to look
09:20 - out for in a nice to have feature
09:22 - also looking for some things that have
09:24 - higher than a 9
09:25 - 19 20 by 1080 display so higher than
09:28 - 1080p
09:28 - like a 2k display or 4k display it's
09:31 - just gonna make the screen that much
09:32 - nicer to look at and again a nice to
09:34 - have if you have the extra bit of budget
09:36 - finally you could go to up to 16
09:38 - gigabytes of ram definitely not
09:39 - necessary but if you have the money
09:42 - 16 gigs is probably worth it and you
09:43 - will see a little bit of a speed
09:45 - increase
09:46 - so that is kind of my recommendation for
09:47 - the mid-tier pc
09:49 - now i'm going to talk about some
09:50 - exceptions or sorry mid-tier
09:52 - laptop i'm going to talk about some
09:54 - exceptions now and things you might want
09:56 - to consider if you're doing some
09:57 - specific program-related tasks
09:59 - so i'll quickly list a few exceptions
10:01 - here to keep in mind if you're a
10:02 - specific type of developer
10:04 - first if you want to develop anything
10:06 - for ios so you want to make ios apps you
10:09 - want to make mac
10:09 - applications you're going to need a mac
10:12 - operating system
10:13 - unfortunately that's just the way it is
10:15 - that's what we have to deal with
10:17 - and you just need a mac if you want to
10:19 - develop anything or actually push it
10:21 - sorry to the app store
10:23 - for ios for ipad whatever any you know
10:25 - mac related operating system
10:28 - next if you're doing anything related to
10:30 - 3d modeling 3d graphics
10:32 - 3d games you're going to want a graphics
10:34 - card and probably a decent one in your
10:36 - system
10:37 - this is simply because you probably will
10:39 - not be able to test the code that you
10:41 - write
10:41 - unless you have something that can
10:42 - actually run it and depending on how
10:44 - intensive the 3d stuff is that you're
10:46 - doing
10:47 - you're probably going to want a graphics
10:48 - card next if you are a data scientist
10:52 - or someone is dealing with extremely
10:53 - large data sets and you don't want to
10:55 - deal with having to batch
10:56 - everything out you probably want more
10:59 - ram
10:59 - in your system now that is simply
11:02 - because if you're loading really large
11:03 - data sets or doing data pre-processing
11:05 - or whatever it may be
11:06 - it's just helpful to have at least say
11:08 - 16 gigs of ram or 32 gigs of ram
11:12 - although i'm sure you're probably
11:13 - dealing with files much larger than that
11:14 - but just keep that in mind that if you
11:16 - want to be able to load that much into
11:17 - ram well you're going to
11:18 - need that much ram next if you're doing
11:21 - machine learning and you want to do
11:22 - model training locally on your machine
11:25 - you're going to want a graphics card in
11:26 - there that's cuda enabled so a nvidia
11:28 - graphics card
11:30 - that is simply because the major
11:31 - frameworks like pi torch tensorflow can
11:33 - utilize
11:34 - cuda and that graphics card to actually
11:36 - accelerate training
11:38 - and well if you want to do it locally
11:39 - you should have a graphics card
11:41 - of course a lot of these things you can
11:43 - mitigate by just you know running
11:44 - virtual machines
11:46 - or going in the cloud and renting out
11:47 - compute power but if you want to avoid
11:49 - that then keep those few things in mind
11:52 - so what i'm going to do now is just show
11:53 - you a few laptops that i found on amazon
11:56 - and just browsing the web that look to
11:58 - me to be decent value
12:00 - now keep in mind that i have not used
12:01 - any of these laptops and i'm very
12:03 - hesitant to recommend them
12:05 - simply because i don't have them in
12:07 - front of me and i'm not actually able to
12:08 - test and try them out
12:10 - but these are just ones i saw that look
12:12 - to be decent value so i figured i'd show
12:14 - you and you can kind of get an idea of
12:15 - the price range of these machines
12:17 - and what i would consider purchasing had
12:19 - i not already had my own laptop
12:21 - so first i'll tell you guys i use a
12:23 - macbook pro
12:24 - 16-inch as my main laptop this is a very
12:27 - expensive laptop for me and canadian
12:29 - dollars it was just over three thousand
12:31 - dollars
12:32 - i'm not recommending that to anyone but
12:33 - i just wanted a very high-end laptop
12:36 - and that's what i've used but in the
12:37 - past i've used laptops that were two
12:39 - hundred dollars three hundred dollars
12:40 - five hundred dollars
12:41 - and honestly most of them have been
12:43 - perfectly fine for a lot of the stuff
12:45 - that i needed to do related to
12:46 - programming
12:47 - anyways the first machine that i found
12:49 - here on amazon is coming in at 879
12:52 - canadian dollars
12:53 - i think that's probably somewhere around
12:55 - 600 650
12:57 - us dollars and this is the lenovo
12:59 - ideapad
13:00 - flex 5 14 inch laptop
13:03 - so this is a touch panel as well so it
13:05 - actually folds all the way over into a
13:07 - tablet
13:08 - eight gigabytes of ddr4 ram it has an i5
13:11 - quad core processor 128 gig ssd
13:15 - runs full windows 10 and that's pretty
13:18 - much all it's showing me right here in
13:19 - the listing
13:20 - this looks like a great machine it's got
13:22 - a lenovo keyboard which are known to be
13:24 - really good
13:24 - and this is something that i would
13:25 - definitely think would be good value
13:27 - just you know quickly br
13:29 - looking at the ratings here five and
13:31 - four star looks to be a fine machine and
13:34 - something that i think would be perfect
13:35 - for people with kind of a mid-range
13:36 - budget
13:37 - so next i have a bit of a higher end
13:39 - laptop this one is lenovo
13:41 - legion 5. this is a 15.6 inch
13:44 - gaming laptop the main difference here
13:46 - when it says gaming i believe is that it
13:48 - has a high refresh rate display
13:50 - you don't need to look for this for
13:51 - programming at all but 120 hertz display
13:54 - just means that the pixels refresh
13:55 - faster so if you're gaming it's a better
13:57 - experience
13:58 - this has a ryzen 7 processor in it eight
14:01 - gigabytes
14:02 - of ram 512 gigabyte ssd and
14:05 - a graphics card with four gigabytes of
14:07 - vram and this is coming in
14:09 - at 1029 canadian dollars which is
14:11 - probably about 750
14:13 - 800 us dollars so again this looks like
14:15 - a great machine if you had a bit of a
14:17 - bigger budget this would be something i
14:18 - would recommend
14:19 - has the graphics card so you could do a
14:21 - little machine learning a little gaming
14:23 - content creation
14:24 - as well as a very fast processor eight
14:26 - gigs of ram and that high refresh rate
14:27 - display of course is nice
14:29 - next i have something that's a little
14:30 - bit cheaper again this is the hp
14:33 - envy x360 two in one laptop so this is a
14:37 - tablet as well
14:38 - comes with 15.6 inch display ryzen 5
14:41 - processor 8 gigabytes of memory 256
14:44 - gigabyte ssd
14:45 - uh it has a backlit keyboard and it runs
14:48 - full windows 10. again good reviews
14:50 - and these are the kind of laptops that i
14:52 - would be looking for and that i would
14:53 - personally recommend in kind of that
14:55 - mid-tier range of course there's
14:57 - definitely lower end laptops
14:59 - i don't know much about the kind of low
15:01 - end spectrum so i'm not going to
15:03 - recommend any specific machines in that
15:05 - range but i do know that following the
15:07 - recommendations i made earlier
15:08 - you can probably find something that's
15:10 - about 400 500 canadian dollars so maybe
15:12 - like 300 us
15:14 - that will be perfectly fine for
15:15 - programming especially if you're just
15:17 - getting started and not doing anything
15:19 - crazy
15:19 - so anyways that has been this video i
15:21 - would love to hear from you guys what
15:23 - you would recommend any specific models
15:25 - what machine you
15:26 - started to learn programming on and if
15:28 - you found any mistakes in this video of
15:29 - course leave them down below
15:31 - with that being said if you enjoyed make
15:32 - sure to leave a like subscribe and i
15:34 - will see you all in another youtube
15:38 - video

15:44 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to the youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna be walking you through my buying guide for a programming laptop now i get asked the question all the time is four gigs of ram enough it's eight gigs of ram enough do i need an i5 do i need an i7 and so in this video i'm going to focus heavily on the specs of a computer and just kind of what you should look for in terms of specs and features in any laptop that you're going to buy for programming so i'm going to start with the bare minimum requirements the absolute minimum i would recommend for any device that you're going to use for programming then i'll give you kind of my recommended configuration for a decent experience i'll talk about some nice to have features and then we'll get in and talk about some specific exceptions so say you're working with you know 3d games you're doing ios apps what kind of machines you might need for that and finally i'll end off by just walking through a few laptops that look good to me that i would personally recommend so that being said let's go ahead and get started and talk about what you should look for in a programming laptop so i'm going to get started by discussing the bare minimum requirements that i would recommend for a programming laptop of course you could go lower than these if you're really on a budget but i would personally recommend saving up until you can buy a device that has these kind of specs just because your experience is going to be much better and you're going to be using that really cheap device maybe for a year or two before you decide to upgrade anyways when all of the new software can no longer run on it anyways let me go through the specs so starting with system memory i'm gonna recommend you have at least four gigabytes of system ram this is because a lot of programs require at minimum four gigabytes of ram to run and if you want to run multiple programs at the same time without having them be drastically slower than they usually would be you're gonna want four gigs of ram even in today's age that's a little bit low but for some basic programming tasks that's totally fine and four gigs should be fine next i'm going to recommend you get a quad core processor so this is going to bring the price up on the computer that you're going to be purchasing it's going to push it you know over a few hundred dollars probably but buying something like a pentium or celeron processor which are dual core processors they're just gonna be very slow and for programming it's just not gonna be a good experience whatsoever i'd highly recommend saving up to get a quad core processor something like an i3 or an i3 equivalent on the amd side i'm not quite sure exactly what that model number would be after that i would recommend having about 120 gigabytes of disk space yes you could go with something like 60 gigs disk space but there is some quite large packages and applications when you're programming and combined with say a windows install or a linux installer whatever operating system it is you're going to be running out of storage quite quickly if you don't have at least 100 gigabytes after that we're going to be talking about operating system what you're going to want to look for typically is windows mac or linux those are kind of the three options you have yes you could use something like ios so you could buy maybe a cheap mobile phone and try to use that for programming or maybe an ipad or a tablet or something like that but you're going to be highly limited to what you can download what programs you can use and what code you can run if you don't get one of those three mentioned operating systems another thing to be careful with is look out for devices that are running running windows s mode that is kind of like the mobile version of windows it comes with a lot less features than your standard windows and only allows you to download things from the windows store you can turn off windows s mode and put it to a fullfledged windows install but that uses a lot more system resources is going to be very slow on that device if it's meant to run windows s mode so personally i would recommend going with linux if you are comfortable with that operating system something like ubuntu is really easy to get used to if you're not coming from a linux background and it will be much faster on a device like this so that's kind of what i'm recommending for the bare minimum essentials of course if you can't afford that you can definitely code simply using any kind of web browser so whatever device you have if it has a web browser you can write code and you can actually start learning and experimenting and that's totally fine but to start doing anything locally you're going to want the specs that i just mentioned so i'm going to quickly list three websites here that i think you should consider if you're someone who has a lower end machine or just want to experiment with coding and don't want to worry about installing and downloading anything first one is called replit this is a browserbased ide so repl it totally free you can write and test code in the cloud next one is google collaboratory this is specifically for python users but you can actually run a jupyter notebook and execute that in the cloud with hardware acceleration as all as well for free so that's like having access to a gpu to train a machine learning model or something like that and then finally there's vs code code spaces i actually don't know how new this is and how accessible it is but i do know that this is visual studio code in the cloud and that essentially means you can use a fullfledged code editor on the cloud on another device totally for free so check those three things out if you have a lower tier machine or you're just looking to kind of get started without needing to download install and set everything up on your own machine so now time for my recommendation for kind of a decent pc that's going to give you a good experience that's not going to be super fast but it's definitely not going to be slow and it's going to be able to achieve kind of all the programming stuff that you want so i'll start by recommending eight gigabytes of system memory you really don't need any more than this eight gigabytes is plenty when you're doing programming and i personally can't think of many situations where i've been doing some kind of programming stuff and needed more than eight gigabytes of memory now of course if you're doing something with machine learning loading large data sets where you want just a ton of different things open at once maybe you're running like three instances of android studio then you might want some more system memory but eight gigabytes is enough you definitely do not need more then i would recommend a i5 processor or higher you also probably could get away with an i3 but sticking with kind of the last recommendation just a quad core processor something modern and something that's just going to be kind of fast right that's what we're looking for so an i5 equivalent or an i5 i don't know what all the amd model numbers are otherwise i would list them next you're going to want to go with probably about 250 gigabytes of storage or more again really depends on what you're going to be using this for and how much you're going to be downloading but i feel like 250 gigs is enough for most people if you have a ton of different applications you might want to go up to 500 gigabytes and a nice feature to look for here would be an ssd so not all computers come with ssds i know it's much more common now but looking for some kind of ssd just means your storage is going to be a little bit faster and that's just going to make for a better experience especially kind of in your daytoday use on the operating system loading things up moving files around so on i also like to mention here to look for stuff that has a usbc port this is kind of a newer port i guess but this is pretty important if you want to think about future proofing your device a lot of the accessories that are coming out now are usbc of course you could dongle stuff but it's just nice to have a really fast port on the computer and i always recommend people look out for usbc next i would recommend that you look for something that has a large screen if this is going to be the only device you use so if you don't have a desktop at home if you're not planning on plugging in an external monitor i'd really recommend you go with something that's 14 inches or larger yes you can go with the 12 inch screens or the 11 inch screens but i find programming at least for myself if i want to have multiple things open on the screen it's really nice to have that extra inch or two of screen screen real estate especially when you're scrolling through large code files i find it can actually make you a bit more efficient and of course it's just nicer to have that extra bit of space so i always recommend that and then of course you're going to want to look for a decent keyboard on the laptop of course if you're working at home you know you can plug into a monitor you can buy an external keyboard and mouse and you can just use the laptop but if this is going to be something where you're on the go all the time you're actually using the laptop keyboard look for something that you're going to enjoy typing on i know i've heard that lenovo has a really good keyboard and i've had a lenovo laptop that i've used and i can definitely say it's probably the best keyboard i've seen on a laptop other than that that's really all you're looking for for a laptop for programming there's nothing special that you need you don't need a graphics card just eight gigs of ram modern processor enough storage big screen and a nice keyboard that's really what you're looking for you can get all of that for probably under 800. so that is kind of my recommendation for the midtier um you know midtier programming laptop no you're not going to be able to game a ton on this um you know it's not going to be the best thing ever but for programming that's really all you need now last thing i'll say here if you're looking for something that's a bit better kind of some nice to have features maybe you've got an extra few hundred bucks in the budget looking for something that has a lower end graphics card maybe with two gigabytes of video memory or four gigabytes will definitely be great if you want to do something like a little bit of video editing content creation maybe you want to play a few video games whatever it may be having some kind of dedicated graphics card is going to be a great investment and it just you know something to look out for in a nice to have feature also looking for some things that have higher than a 9 19 20 by 1080 display so higher than 1080p like a 2k display or 4k display it's just gonna make the screen that much nicer to look at and again a nice to have if you have the extra bit of budget finally you could go to up to 16 gigabytes of ram definitely not necessary but if you have the money 16 gigs is probably worth it and you will see a little bit of a speed increase so that is kind of my recommendation for the midtier pc now i'm going to talk about some exceptions or sorry midtier laptop i'm going to talk about some exceptions now and things you might want to consider if you're doing some specific programrelated tasks so i'll quickly list a few exceptions here to keep in mind if you're a specific type of developer first if you want to develop anything for ios so you want to make ios apps you want to make mac applications you're going to need a mac operating system unfortunately that's just the way it is that's what we have to deal with and you just need a mac if you want to develop anything or actually push it sorry to the app store for ios for ipad whatever any you know mac related operating system next if you're doing anything related to 3d modeling 3d graphics 3d games you're going to want a graphics card and probably a decent one in your system this is simply because you probably will not be able to test the code that you write unless you have something that can actually run it and depending on how intensive the 3d stuff is that you're doing you're probably going to want a graphics card next if you are a data scientist or someone is dealing with extremely large data sets and you don't want to deal with having to batch everything out you probably want more ram in your system now that is simply because if you're loading really large data sets or doing data preprocessing or whatever it may be it's just helpful to have at least say 16 gigs of ram or 32 gigs of ram although i'm sure you're probably dealing with files much larger than that but just keep that in mind that if you want to be able to load that much into ram well you're going to need that much ram next if you're doing machine learning and you want to do model training locally on your machine you're going to want a graphics card in there that's cuda enabled so a nvidia graphics card that is simply because the major frameworks like pi torch tensorflow can utilize cuda and that graphics card to actually accelerate training and well if you want to do it locally you should have a graphics card of course a lot of these things you can mitigate by just you know running virtual machines or going in the cloud and renting out compute power but if you want to avoid that then keep those few things in mind so what i'm going to do now is just show you a few laptops that i found on amazon and just browsing the web that look to me to be decent value now keep in mind that i have not used any of these laptops and i'm very hesitant to recommend them simply because i don't have them in front of me and i'm not actually able to test and try them out but these are just ones i saw that look to be decent value so i figured i'd show you and you can kind of get an idea of the price range of these machines and what i would consider purchasing had i not already had my own laptop so first i'll tell you guys i use a macbook pro 16inch as my main laptop this is a very expensive laptop for me and canadian dollars it was just over three thousand dollars i'm not recommending that to anyone but i just wanted a very highend laptop and that's what i've used but in the past i've used laptops that were two hundred dollars three hundred dollars five hundred dollars and honestly most of them have been perfectly fine for a lot of the stuff that i needed to do related to programming anyways the first machine that i found here on amazon is coming in at 879 canadian dollars i think that's probably somewhere around 600 650 us dollars and this is the lenovo ideapad flex 5 14 inch laptop so this is a touch panel as well so it actually folds all the way over into a tablet eight gigabytes of ddr4 ram it has an i5 quad core processor 128 gig ssd runs full windows 10 and that's pretty much all it's showing me right here in the listing this looks like a great machine it's got a lenovo keyboard which are known to be really good and this is something that i would definitely think would be good value just you know quickly br looking at the ratings here five and four star looks to be a fine machine and something that i think would be perfect for people with kind of a midrange budget so next i have a bit of a higher end laptop this one is lenovo legion 5. this is a 15.6 inch gaming laptop the main difference here when it says gaming i believe is that it has a high refresh rate display you don't need to look for this for programming at all but 120 hertz display just means that the pixels refresh faster so if you're gaming it's a better experience this has a ryzen 7 processor in it eight gigabytes of ram 512 gigabyte ssd and a graphics card with four gigabytes of vram and this is coming in at 1029 canadian dollars which is probably about 750 800 us dollars so again this looks like a great machine if you had a bit of a bigger budget this would be something i would recommend has the graphics card so you could do a little machine learning a little gaming content creation as well as a very fast processor eight gigs of ram and that high refresh rate display of course is nice next i have something that's a little bit cheaper again this is the hp envy x360 two in one laptop so this is a tablet as well comes with 15.6 inch display ryzen 5 processor 8 gigabytes of memory 256 gigabyte ssd uh it has a backlit keyboard and it runs full windows 10. again good reviews and these are the kind of laptops that i would be looking for and that i would personally recommend in kind of that midtier range of course there's definitely lower end laptops i don't know much about the kind of low end spectrum so i'm not going to recommend any specific machines in that range but i do know that following the recommendations i made earlier you can probably find something that's about 400 500 canadian dollars so maybe like 300 us that will be perfectly fine for programming especially if you're just getting started and not doing anything crazy so anyways that has been this video i would love to hear from you guys what you would recommend any specific models what machine you started to learn programming on and if you found any mistakes in this video of course leave them down below with that being said if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe and i will see you all in another youtube video
