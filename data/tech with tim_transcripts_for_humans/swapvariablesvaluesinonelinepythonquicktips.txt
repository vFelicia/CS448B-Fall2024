00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to the
00:01 - video of Python quick tips in this video
00:03 - I'm going to show you how we can swap
00:04 - the value of two variables in one line
00:06 - in Python
00:07 - now without knowing this trick the way
00:09 - that we usually go about swapping
00:10 - variables is something like this we
00:12 - start by creating a temp variable that's
00:14 - equal to one of the variables in this
00:15 - case a then we can reassign a's value to
00:18 - BB and when we resize V we're assign
00:20 - that to the temp variable so that we get
00:22 - the original value of a now this works
00:24 - fine if I print this out you can see
00:26 - that does indeed change our values to be
00:27 - 45 and 65 but this is not very nice and
00:30 - we want to do this the pythonic way now
00:32 - the Python way to do this is just do a
00:34 - comma B equals B comma a and this will
00:37 - perform the swab for you automatically
00:39 - so when we do that and I run the program
00:40 - you can see we are still indeed swapping
00:42 - the variables now this works with any
00:44 - number of variables I can do C equals
00:46 - something like 100 and then maybe we'll
00:48 - swap this process completely so I'll say
00:50 - ABC equals I don't know maybe we'll do
00:53 - something like B C a now when we do that
00:56 - we can print out ABC and you can see
00:59 - that this does indeed work and we can
01:00 - swap that many variables this has been
01:02 - Python quick tips if you guys enjoyed
01:04 - make sure you leave a like and let me
01:05 - know what else you want to see from this
01:06 - series
