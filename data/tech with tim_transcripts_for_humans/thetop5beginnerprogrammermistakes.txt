00:04 - error messages please read through your
00:06 - error messages they do often tell you
00:08 - exactly where the error is and what's
00:10 - going wrong number two is using poor
00:12 - variable names using names like X Y X1
00:16 - x2p P1 P2 instead use something more
00:19 - descriptive that actually explains what
00:21 - the variable is doing and the purpose of
00:23 - it in the program number three is
00:25 - repeating logic having the same blocks
00:27 - of code multiple times using say 30 or
00:30 - 40 appends or push statements to get
00:32 - something inside of an array rather than
00:34 - using a for Loop next is rushing into
00:36 - complex topics oftentimes we want to get
00:39 - into classes objects all these Advanced
00:42 - programming language features before we
00:44 - understand the fundamentals and lastly
00:46 - blindly copying code so many times
00:48 - people go to stack Overflow they see a
00:50 - block of code they just blindly copy it
00:52 - and dump it in their program if
00:53 - something goes wrong and they have no
00:55 - idea what this code is because they
00:57 - didn't understand it before they
00:58 - actually used it
