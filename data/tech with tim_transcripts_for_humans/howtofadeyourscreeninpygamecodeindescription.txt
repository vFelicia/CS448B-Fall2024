00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video today's video I'm just
00:04 - doing a quick tutorial in PI game on how
00:07 - to fade your screen so if you guys
00:09 - watched one of my previous videos on a
00:11 - game that I made in PI game it's called
00:13 - a golf game that's just what I called it
00:15 - it's on my channel if you want to go
00:16 - check it out I'll leave a card to it in
00:18 - the top right hand corner here there was
00:20 - someone who asked in the comments down
00:22 - below how I faded this screen now I just
00:25 - pretty much the way that I did that was
00:27 - just by using a surface and PI game and
00:30 - by changing the Alpha property of that
00:32 - so if you don't know what alpha is it's
00:34 - the same thing as opacity so whenever
00:36 - you have a surface you also have an
00:38 - opacity for that service so if you see
00:40 - objects that you can see through like
00:41 - something like glass sunglasses maybe
00:44 - they have opacity meaning that you can
00:47 - see through them if something has a
00:49 - hundred opacity that means you can't see
00:52 - through it and it's opaque a little bit
00:55 - of I guess you might do that in science
00:57 - or something so I'll show you what it
00:58 - looks like here in case you're still
00:59 - confused just by running a little
01:01 - program I made you can see what right
01:03 - here this is what the surface looks like
01:05 - and if I just click on the mouse it
01:07 - starts to fade out now in my opinion
01:09 - that looks pretty damn cool if you're
01:13 - transitioning between like two different
01:14 - scenes or if you're going from like an A
01:17 - level to like a score sheet or something
01:19 - which is what I did in my game so if you
01:21 - guys want to learn how to do this it's
01:23 - really simple and I'm just gonna give
01:25 - you the code for it now you can pretty
01:26 - much just copy and paste it into your
01:28 - program but I'll show you if you watch
01:30 - throughout the rest of the video how to
01:32 - implement it properly so you don't run
01:33 - into any issues so make sure you stay
01:35 - till the end so we're here this is my
01:38 - little thing here now all that we really
01:40 - have to worry about in this program is
01:42 - this right here now this is my function
01:45 - that pretty much creates the fading
01:48 - effect now the way that it fades is
01:50 - simply by creating a new PI game surface
01:54 - that's gonna be the same width and
01:56 - height of your screen so you can see
01:59 - here I take two two arguments width and
02:01 - height now this if you want it to fade
02:04 - only a section of your screen is why I
02:05 - have this on so you could change how
02:08 - large the section of fade is see if I
02:11 - I'll just show you quickly what I mean
02:12 - that is if I change this to like 500 and
02:17 - I run it you can see only half the
02:18 - screen is fading and that's pretty much
02:21 - all that means for the width and height
02:22 - so I'll change it back now and in here
02:25 - we create a new surface and then we fill
02:28 - the surface with block now if you want
02:30 - to fade to white you could just change
02:32 - this color if you wanted to fade to
02:33 - green you could change this color
02:34 - whatever you like in there and then I
02:37 - just do a really simple for loop and
02:38 - it's just for alpha in range 0 and 300
02:42 - now the Alpha goes from 0 to 300 I
02:45 - believe in PI game it might go a little
02:47 - higher than that but this is what I use
02:48 - and pretty much all this does is it
02:50 - integrates 300 times through alpha
02:53 - property so first we're drawing a window
02:56 - that has an opacity or alpha setting of
02:58 - 1 and then it has 2 and that is 3/4 so
03:01 - it keeps getting darker as we move
03:02 - through the for loop now what I do is
03:04 - you just do fade dot set alpha is how
03:06 - you change the Alpha property of of a
03:09 - surface you could do that with your
03:10 - window as well and then we just redraw
03:12 - everything that we're drunk so you
03:13 - should if you have a game have a
03:16 - function that redraws everything just in
03:19 - that one function so you're not drawing
03:20 - things from different areas now if you
03:23 - don't have this is gonna be kind of hard
03:24 - to implement but just pretty much
03:26 - everything that you're drawing is in a
03:27 - function right that's what I have at
03:28 - least here I fill the screen I draw my
03:30 - two rectangles inside this function now
03:32 - it's important that inside the function
03:35 - you don't update the screen if you
03:37 - update the screen inside of the function
03:39 - then you're gonna run into a slight
03:40 - issue so which I can show you in a
03:43 - second now after we redraw everything
03:45 - that's gonna be behind the fade we now
03:48 - draw the fade to the screen so on our
03:50 - main window which I just create up here
03:52 - and then we do PI game dot displayed
03:55 - update just updating the screen and we
03:58 - wait 5 milliseconds so that doesn't move
04:00 - too fast if you want to go slower or
04:02 - faster you just change this number up or
04:03 - down accordingly now it's important that
04:07 - you call your screen win or if you don't
04:09 - want to call it win then you have to
04:10 - change this you can see that this
04:12 - corresponds to my main window redraw
04:15 - window is the name of the function that
04:16 - I used to redraw everything behind the
04:19 - fade and then fade is just something
04:22 - that I came
04:23 - with just a name for the for the surface
04:25 - and that's about it so I'll show you the
04:27 - issue you run into if you update
04:28 - something in your in your window here or
04:30 - in your redraw function you poly game
04:33 - displayed out up that you're gonna see
04:35 - it looks like it's flickering here when
04:36 - I run this thing you can see it starts
04:38 - to flicker and it just that's obviously
04:39 - not what you want kind of hurts your
04:41 - eyes so just make sure you don't do that
04:43 - in there and I'm gonna put this code in
04:46 - the description down below feel free to
04:48 - copy and paste that into your programs
04:50 - and if you guys have any issues don't be
04:52 - afraid to leave me a comment down below
04:54 - I am usually responding to those
04:56 - comments and helping you guys out so if
