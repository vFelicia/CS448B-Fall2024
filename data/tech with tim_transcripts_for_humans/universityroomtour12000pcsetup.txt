00:02 - video so in today's video I'm gonna be
00:04 - doing something completely different
00:05 - that I've never done on my channel
00:07 - before and this is a university room
00:09 - tour in kind of like a vlog style video
00:13 - now I have never done any kind of
00:15 - vlogging or anything like this I think I
00:17 - did a decent job but I'd love to hear

00:21 - you take it easy this is my first time
00:22 - doing a vlog so yeah so anyways before I

00:33 - watching this video today is officially
00:35 - the day the tech with Tim has hit twenty
00:38 - thousand subscribers that's right twenty
00:41 - thousand subscribers only a month and a
00:43 - half ago I just hit ten thousand and
00:46 - even that was absolutely unreal and
00:48 - something that I've been working for for
00:49 - so long so to have that much growth to
00:52 - essentially double my subscriber base in
00:54 - only a month and a half it just is so
00:57 - outstanding and unreal to me I can't
00:59 - even believe that I'm sitting at this
01:01 - number but just thank you guys so much I
01:03 - have so many plans for the future so
01:06 - many cool things I want to do we're
01:07 - really just getting started here and I
01:09 - hope that you guys are coming along for
01:10 - the ride because I can tell you there's
01:12 - gonna be some awesome stuff that you
01:13 - guys are definitely not gonna want to
01:15 - miss in the future before I go too far
01:17 - here I just need to say that I do have a
01:19 - patreon account some of you guys have
01:21 - noted that you'd be willing to support
01:22 - that you know that I don't make that
01:24 - much money off of YouTube and it's
01:26 - something that I really want to do more
01:27 - and more and more and focus as much time
01:29 - as possible
01:30 - so even just providing like a dollar a
01:32 - month a small donation via patreon
01:34 - really helps me out and allows me to
01:36 - focus more of my time and efforts here
01:38 - on YouTube to keep creating awesome free
01:41 - content for you guys so with that being
01:43 - said thank you guys once again so much
01:45 - and I hope that you enjoy the video
01:48 - [Music]
01:55 - alright so the way that my kind of
01:57 - residence style works essentially is
02:00 - that you share a room with one other
02:02 - person and you share kind of a common
02:03 - area which I'm gonna be showing to you
02:06 - guys right now and then you have your
02:07 - own kind of door you can see those are
02:08 - the two doors right there and your own
02:10 - room which is your own private space so
02:12 - it's really nice because you do have a
02:13 - roommate but if you don't want to see
02:14 - them kind of just lock yourself in your
02:15 - room and having your own bathroom in
02:18 - your room is actually really nice luxury
02:20 - for university I'm sure if any you guys
02:21 - are students you can relate that a lot
02:23 - of the residences are not very nice
02:26 - alright so now I'm gonna walk you guys
02:27 - through kind of the main shared space of
02:30 - my room so this is what I call like the
02:33 - common space there's a nice little table
02:34 - we brought it through a few extra chairs
02:36 - into here and then we have what's known
02:38 - as kind of like a little kitchenette so
02:39 - a bit of space for some snacks and some
02:42 - food and some cupboard space and then we
02:44 - have obviously a microwave a sink we all
02:48 - these dishes and stuff we're stuff that
02:50 - I draw it I'm sure you guys know what
02:52 - that is and then I have a little toaster
02:54 - a coffee maker which is essential I love
02:57 - my coffee in the morning and then
02:58 - obviously I keep some snacks and stuff
03:00 - in some of the drawers here so as well a
03:03 - full-size fridge which is also awesome
03:06 - because I have a freezer which means I
03:07 - can keep like frozen food and stuff up
03:09 - here if I wanted to so I mean we had
03:11 - like some cookies some other stuff in
03:13 - there and then obviously the fridge just
03:16 - for I don't know whatever stuff that
03:18 - needs to stay cold now we also share a
03:20 - washroom um it's actually a decent sized
03:22 - washroom I mean you guys can see me now
03:24 - and pretty I don't know standard but
03:28 - it's nice to have a washroom because a
03:29 - lot of university residences don't have
03:32 - that at all so anyways that's kind of it
03:34 - for the main common space there's
03:36 - nothing too exciting here but now I'm
03:37 - gonna bring you guys into my room where
03:39 - I'm sure is what you actually want to
03:41 - see from this video so let's go in
03:46 - alright so now I'm in my actual room by
03:49 - the way the audio sounds a lot better in
03:51 - here I don't know why it's so echo II
03:52 - out there but I'm gonna walk you guys
03:54 - through my whole kind of setup so my
03:56 - whole PC set up and then where I also
03:58 - just spend most of my time in terms of
03:59 - what the room layout looks like so if
04:01 - you guys did follow my Twitter around my
04:03 - Instagram you already know what my
04:04 - looks like just saying so you might want
04:05 - to hop on there if you're not but let's
04:07 - give you guys a quick tour now so
04:09 - essentially this is my room right here
04:13 - give you a quick pan of everything this
04:16 - it's pretty small but for a university
04:18 - room having something like a double bed
04:20 - which I have right now a nice closet
04:22 - like I actually really like this room
04:24 - and this style of kind of living is is
04:26 - perfectly fine um so yeah this is I mean
04:28 - the closet nothing too exciting here
04:31 - just where I hang up on my stuff I've
04:32 - got some shoes laundry standard stuff
04:35 - like that a little fan old side table
04:38 - and yeah so now let's bring you over to
04:41 - the PC setup which I'm sure is the part
04:43 - that you guys are actually most
04:44 - interested in so this is kind of my main
04:48 - PC desk setup layout whatever you want
04:51 - to call it and this is where all of the
04:53 - magic happens in terms of recording
04:55 - videos and actually getting work done so
04:58 - I bring you up close here I'm running a
05:00 - dual monitor setup that's actually my
05:02 - disc word server up right now you guys
05:03 - should definitely hop in there too and I
05:06 - did have a third monitor back at home
05:08 - but I couldn't bring it because it's
05:10 - wall-mounted and I can't actually mount
05:12 - anything on the wall so right now what
05:13 - I'm showing you obviously is my computer
05:15 - it's hard to get a good angle at it but
05:18 - I mean you get the idea it's got the
05:19 - LEDs and it's actually tempered glass on
05:22 - four sides so on the back as well which
05:24 - I can't really show you from here um let
05:27 - me give you guys a quick sneak peek on
05:29 - my cable management ah it's a bit messy
05:33 - but if you guys have a computer setup
05:36 - like mine you'll know like there's a ton
05:38 - of cables and it's not easy to manage
05:41 - them nicely and I can't really be
05:42 - bothered to do that anyways um so yeah
05:44 - go through the rest of the stuff I mean
05:46 - all you guys ask my keyboard I use this
05:48 - is just like a I don't even know das key
05:50 - don't know what brand that is but it's
05:53 - cherry MX red switches which I really
05:55 - actually like they're a bit like I make
05:57 - a few typos with them as you might
05:59 - notice but it's finally good for gaming
06:00 - as well which I do a little bit of this
06:02 - is just my standard SteelSeries mouse
06:04 - like that Mouse as well it's like fifty
06:06 - bucks or something and then obviously my
06:08 - blue Yeti microphone which is what I
06:10 - used to record all of my kind of screen
06:13 - recording videos this is just like my
06:15 - standard face cam I got like a Logitech
06:18 - whatever the highest Logitech face game
06:20 - is that's what I have and then this is
06:21 - my light that I use for the face camp
06:24 - and for doing vlogs like this um so
06:27 - these are kind of my controllers for all
06:29 - this so this is the light controller
06:31 - obviously um it actually changes in
06:34 - brightness as well not sure if you guys
06:35 - can focus focus maybe ok maybe not but
06:40 - anyways it changes like you can change
06:42 - the temperature of it and brightness
06:44 - which is nice and this is my controller
06:45 - just for what he caught underneath the
06:48 - desk in terms of some other stuff that I
06:50 - have in terms of tech stuff I actually
06:53 - have like a whole beam here full of I
06:55 - can't even pull it out there's so much
06:57 - full like tech stuff and wires and
06:59 - cables and that whole bottom thing there
07:02 - is also full of tech stuff and cables
07:04 - and wires in case I ever need them I
07:06 - have my iPad here usually I have my live
07:08 - subscriber count up but I just haven't
07:11 - done it phone charger fidget spinner
07:14 - which I use like consistently especially
07:16 - when I'm trying to focus and then this
07:18 - is my drawing tablet that I use for like
07:20 - all my kind of illustrations or what not
07:23 - so I mean like this isn't too exciting
07:25 - there's not too much stuff but in terms
07:27 - of like a resin this is quite a bit of
07:29 - tech equipment I would say and I'm
07:31 - valuing it at probably close to $12,000
07:37 - which is ridiculous
07:39 - when I say it but over the course of a
07:41 - few years that's probably how much I've
07:42 - spent on it Oh
07:44 - laptops almost forgot this is my main
07:46 - school laptop which I only bring it to
07:48 - class I just use it in class or labs I
07:50 - mean just like a standard Dell laptop
07:53 - it's got an i7 has a GPU in it I don't
07:56 - know it's a decent old laptop 15 inch
07:58 - screen by the way and then this is my
07:59 - Mac old Mac that I just used for like
08:03 - watching YouTube and all that kind of
08:04 - stuff because I like the smaller screen
08:06 - size I just have it on my lap or whatnot
08:08 - um yeah I mean that's really almost it
08:13 - there's not too much to talk about in
08:16 - terms of other stuff in my room I guess
08:19 - I can show you guys my view let's do
08:20 - that so this is the view from my room
08:23 - again
08:24 - nothing special that's a highway we're
08:26 - really fast cars go by and make a lot of
08:28 - noise and then that is another building
08:30 - so
08:31 - nothing too exciting there you can see
08:33 - why I usually keep my drapes closed I've
08:35 - got some cupboards here or cabinets
08:37 - whatever you want to call them and then
08:39 - I keep kind of my school binders down
08:41 - below my desk and obviously you can see
08:44 - the LED strips which I really like they
08:46 - add a nice kind of glow and touch to the
08:48 - room so anyways that has pretty much
08:50 - been it for this kind of vlog tour of my
08:52 - room sorry if this wasn't super exciting
08:55 - but I think it gives you a little bit of
08:56 - an insight into what I've been living in
08:58 - for the past eight months and I'm
09:00 - filming this video now especially
09:01 - because I'm gonna be moving out in
09:02 - probably 1520 days and I want to make
09:06 - sure that I got a quick vlog of what
09:07 - it's like even just for myself so I can
09:09 - look back show family show friends in
09:12 - the future at some point I think that's
09:14 - an interesting concept as well so
09:15 - anyways if you guys have enjoyed the
09:17 - video please make sure you leave a like
09:18 - and subscribe and if you want to see
09:19 - other kind of vlog content like this
09:21 - please let me know as I do have this
09:23 - awesome camera which is the Panasonic g7
09:26 - and I really want to use it for a bunch
09:28 - of other videos like this so with that
09:30 - being said I will see you guys in
09:31 - another video
09:32 - [Music]
