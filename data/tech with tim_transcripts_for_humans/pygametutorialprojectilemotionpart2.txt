00:06 - the angle we're gonna have to use a bit
00:08 - of trig so I already have a function
00:10 - I've
00:10 - wrote here because I didn't want to have
00:12 - to do it on camera so I'm just gonna
00:15 - copy and paste it and I'm gonna go
00:17 - through it and give you as a second to
00:18 - copy it down so I'm just gonna paste it
00:20 - under here and it's called find angle so
00:23 - this is the function right here it
00:26 - pretty much takes a position and the
00:29 - position is well the position of our of
00:32 - our mouse and then vs. the golf ball so
00:37 - it already has a position the golf ball
00:39 - we just have to give it the position of
00:40 - the mouse and then what it does here is
00:42 - it tries to tangent the angle to figure
00:46 - or tangent the the golf balls X&Y to
00:50 - figure out the length of that line to
00:53 - start with right and if you can't do
00:55 - this so it can't arc arc tangent this
00:58 - then it's just gonna do math dot pi
01:00 - divided by two because the only time
01:02 - that math thought that this won't work
01:04 - is if it's if it's a certain value in
01:08 - radians so if you don't understand
01:10 - radians I'm gonna pull up a unit circle
01:11 - here quickly actually pretty much every
01:16 - degree has a Radian equivalent so 30
01:19 - degrees is PI over six 45 degrees is PI
01:22 - over four and you can look on here and
01:24 - so on you don't really have to
01:25 - understand exactly how they work or why
01:27 - we use them but in one full circle we
01:29 - have two pi radians 180 degrees is pi
01:33 - radians and so on so you're gonna see
01:37 - that I have some like math dot PI's and
01:40 - stuff in here that's just because that's
01:41 - the way radiance work you don't really
01:42 - have to understand them but here's unit
01:45 - circle anyways if you want to look at it
01:46 - so we'll close that out so let me just
01:48 - go over this again I think I messed it
01:50 - up so pretty much the arctangent is what
01:52 - we use in for radians to figure out the
01:55 - angle if we're given two positions in a
01:57 - right triangle so let me just pull this
01:59 - up for a second I'm steadily good 0 for
02:02 - now and so if we have a line like this
02:05 - then that means if we go directly down
02:07 - and we go directly across then we can
02:10 - find the two components of those lines
02:12 - so the x value and the y value now if we
02:15 - know those two components or those two
02:18 - lines the values there and we know that
02:20 - it's a right triangle
02:22 - then we can use those two components to
02:26 - figure out the angle here that would be
02:28 - down here to the line it's hard to show
02:30 - you because my mouse is what's creating
02:31 - the line but I hope you can understand
02:34 - that so we're gonna we try to do that
02:35 - now with the with the arctan tangent if
02:39 - that doesn't work then we're just gonna
02:41 - default to this because that would mean
02:43 - that the one case where it doesn't work
02:44 - is is this alright so now this is where
02:47 - we determine what direction we're
02:50 - actually shooting it so once we figure
02:52 - out the angle now we have to determine
02:54 - if we're shooting left if we're shooting
02:56 - right if we're going down if we're going
02:58 - down left just copy this down here don't
03:02 - exactly you don't have to worry exactly
03:04 - what it does this just figure out what
03:05 - quadrant your mouse is in so looking at
03:09 - the unit circle we have four quadrants
03:11 - just figures out what quadrants in so
03:13 - copy this down pause the video and then
03:16 - we're gonna move on to the rest here so
03:18 - what I'm just gonna do for angle isn't I
03:20 - do find angle and then we're gonna put
03:24 - pause in here and pause is gonna be
03:26 - again the position of our mouse like
03:29 - that alright so now we've got that part
03:31 - down and we're gonna find the angle
03:34 - we're gonna find the power and we're
03:36 - gonna set where we're shooting from now
03:38 - we have to get the physics involved so
03:40 - we've used all the math now with the
03:41 - trig now we have to use the physics to
03:44 - determine exactly where the ball is
03:46 - going to be moving and how far at what
03:48 - time so we're gonna go up here to the
03:51 - beginning of our function and we're just
03:52 - gonna do a new thing here we're gonna
03:54 - say if shoot like this so that means the
03:57 - ball is in motion we're shooting the
03:59 - ball then we are going to what we're
04:03 - gonna have to do is now check if the
04:06 - ball has already collided with the
04:07 - ground or not so we know if we should
04:08 - continue shooting it or if we should
04:10 - stop the ball so I'm just gonna say if
04:12 - golf ball dot Y is less than 500 minus
04:18 - golf ball dart radius so this just means
04:22 - that we've now gone past the bottom of
04:24 - the screen or we're about to go past the
04:26 - bottom of the screen we don't want to
04:28 - continue moving the ball because that's
04:29 - our ground so it's gonna hit there and
04:31 - then ideally it would bounce but that's
04:33 - gonna be in the next part of the video
04:35 - now we're just gonna do time plus equals
04:38 - 0.05 the reason I'm doing this is
04:42 - because that's gonna be the increment of
04:43 - time that makes it look like it's moving
04:45 - properly Kanna so 0.05 seconds is what
04:50 - that's gonna be P oh this is just gonna
04:52 - be position I just don't want to
04:54 - override this position here so I just do
04:55 - this and we're gonna do full dot ball
05:00 - path don't worry we're gonna go back up
05:04 - and fix that method we're just gonna
05:05 - plug this in for now we're gonna do XY
05:07 - power angle time like that now we're
05:13 - going to set our positions or change
05:14 - them for the golf ball so golf ball that
05:16 - x equals P o zero and golf ball dot y
05:21 - equals po1 okay so I know I went really
05:27 - fast let's recap here quickly
05:29 - so pretty much what happens here if the
05:31 - user clicks the mouse then we're gonna
05:33 - check to make sure he's not already
05:34 - shooting the ball if he is not we're
05:36 - gonna set shoot equal to true we're
05:38 - gonna determine where he had shot the
05:39 - ball at so wherever that golf ball is at
05:41 - that time we're gonna set time equal to
05:43 - zero so we're gonna reset that to make
05:45 - sure that it is at zero we're gonna do
05:47 - power we're gonna set the power based on
05:49 - the length of the line and we're just
05:50 - gonna divide it by eight so it's not too
05:52 - big of a number then we're gonna find
05:53 - the angle between our mouse and the ball
05:57 - now the way that we do that is by using
05:59 - this function that I've written in here
06:01 - again you don't have to understand how
06:03 - this works but just copy it out and then
06:06 - we now need to do this ball power so
06:09 - this ball path function is what's gonna
06:11 - use the physics to determine how the
06:14 - ball is gonna move through the air so
06:15 - let's get into this now and this is
06:18 - going to be kind of the end or the
06:21 - wrapping up part of the video now so
06:23 - we're just gonna start by doing this we
06:27 - need to find the two components of our
06:30 - movement so we have a X velocity and a Y
06:34 - velocity now the way that a ball moves
06:37 - in physics in two dimensions is each
06:41 - second it moves X by us X by a certain
06:44 - amount of degrees and it moves Y by a
06:45 - certain amount or not degrees a certain
06:47 - amount right
06:48 - so it can move X by five maybe and it's
06:50 - moving Y by two or it's moving X by
06:53 - seven and moving down Y by three so we
06:56 - need to figure out exactly how that is
06:58 - gonna work so now that we have the angle
07:00 - and the power we know the diagonal power
07:02 - but we have to know what the velocity is
07:05 - going to be going X and what the
07:06 - velocity is gonna be going Y so we'll
07:08 - figure that out now to do that we simply
07:11 - need to just do math or cosine and then
07:14 - of angle multiplied by our power and
07:17 - this gives us our X velocity and to find
07:20 - the Y velocity we just do map both sine
07:22 - of our angle and our angle is in radians
07:24 - by the way that's this is y in Python
07:27 - all the mouth stuff it uses radians
07:28 - unless you convert it into degrees and
07:30 - then we have math dot sine angle times
07:33 - power so that gives us our Y component
07:36 - so now we go down and we have to
07:38 - calculate how far we moved on the
07:41 - x-direction and how far you moved on the
07:43 - y-direction now the X Direction is easy
07:45 - because we're moving at a constant
07:48 - velocity right so there's no gravity
07:51 - moving left and right gravity only
07:52 - pushes us downward so the X Direction is
07:55 - easy we just do our velocity of x times
07:58 - our time so if say for example if you're
08:01 - moving five meters per second and you're
08:04 - it was two seconds into your motion then
08:07 - how far would you be you would be ten
08:08 - meters because you moved five meters per
08:10 - second right now our Y is a little bit
08:13 - more complicated now this is just a
08:15 - formula you can find us online it's
08:17 - motion with downwards acceleration so
08:20 - since our acceleration of gravity is
08:22 - negative 9.8 meters per second down we
08:26 - need to use that in this formula so
08:28 - we're just gonna start by doing valve Y
08:29 - times time plus now these brackets are
08:33 - very important so make sure that you do
08:35 - not forget them we're gonna do another
08:37 - set of brackets and now I know gravity
08:39 - is usually negative 9.8 meters per
08:41 - second squared but I like to set my
08:43 - gravity to about half of that just so it
08:45 - doesn't move down as quickly if you want
08:47 - to be more realistic you can change that
08:49 - number you can play with it all these
08:50 - numbers you can play with and it's just
08:54 - gonna give you a different kind of
08:55 - motion x squared divided by 2
08:59 - that so make sure you guys copy this out
09:02 - and it looks exactly like this otherwise
09:05 - it's not gonna work properly again you
09:07 - can change this number but not keep it
09:09 - the same and now we need to calculate
09:11 - our new X and our new Y so to do this we
09:15 - do new X is equal to and then we're just
09:19 - gonna round this here so we don't get
09:21 - crazy decimal numbers we're new distance
09:23 - X so that's how much we moved in the
09:25 - x-direction plus our initial starting
09:29 - direction our starting position and then
09:31 - remember in Python how moving positive
09:36 - actually moves you downwards rather than
09:38 - how you would think it works like if
09:40 - you're subtracting you go downwards so
09:42 - in this case we actually have to
09:44 - subtract to move upwards we're going to
09:47 - start Y minus and then our distance of y
09:51 - and then we're gonna return that value
09:54 - in a tuple let's go return new X and new
10:00 - Y again we went kind of fast there but
10:03 - that's how this works this is the
10:06 - physics that we're incorporating into
10:07 - this and that just gets our X component
10:10 - or Y component and then we can tell how
10:12 - to move our ball and this is exactly how
10:14 - projectile motion works now we're not
10:17 - really bothered about finding like the
10:18 - max distance or the max height we just
10:20 - want to display this on the screen so
10:23 - that we can see it if we wanted to
10:24 - figure that out that would be a
10:25 - different tutorial okay so we've done
10:27 - that now and let's just check the rear
10:30 - code and make sure that everything
10:32 - should be working so we have if shoot
10:34 - then we're gonna check to make sure that
10:36 - our ball is not shouldn't should be
10:39 - moving so it's not like below the screen
10:41 - then we're gonna move it we need to add
10:43 - one thing here which is so once our ball
10:46 - hits the ground or goes lower than the
10:47 - ground we need to stop moving so we're
10:50 - gonna shoot it goes false and we're
10:53 - gonna set its position so that we make
10:55 - sure it's able to shoot next time so
10:57 - it's higher on the ground reach go golf
11:00 - ball dot Y is equal to 494 and that's
11:05 - initially what we set it to here right
11:08 - and that should be about it so I'm just
11:12 - checking through here quickly make sure
11:14 - it looks good and I think it does so
11:17 - let's try this out okay so we have the
11:20 - line and let's see what happens when I
11:23 - click there we go and you can see the
11:26 - ball shoots around the screen now you'll
11:29 - notice this moves kind of fast right if
11:33 - we don't want it to move as fast there's
11:35 - a few things that we can do to fix that
11:38 - so the first thing we're gonna do to fix
11:40 - that is by changing this number here
11:42 - now this time is well exactly what it
11:45 - does by how much you increment it is how
11:47 - fast the program's going to go so if I
11:49 - change this to 0.01 and I run the
11:52 - program
11:52 - you'll notice that we go very very slow
11:55 - like that if I change it to for example
11:58 - 0.1 and I run it then we go really
12:03 - really really fast so you guys have to
12:05 - play around with this number it's gonna
12:07 - be different depending on your computer
12:09 - as well I know it seems weird but pretty
12:11 - much how fast your processor is is gonna
12:13 - determine how fast this while loop runs
12:15 - so there are a few things you can do to
12:17 - set exactly how fast the while loop runs
12:19 - but we're not gonna worry about that
12:21 - right now so just play with this time
12:23 - number
12:23 - I usually go anywhere from 0.01 to 0.1
12:27 - depending on how fast your computer is
12:29 - and you can see that 0.025 seems to be
12:34 - working well for me now the longer that
12:36 - your line gets the more that your ball
12:39 - moves so I hope you guys enjoyed this
12:42 - tutorial I know it's probably not the
12:44 - best I tried to go at a reasonable pace
12:47 - but again we can't spend too long going
12:49 - over everything this involves physics
12:52 - and involves math is pretty complex so
12:55 - if you guys understood it then give
12:57 - yourself a pat on the back and if you
12:59 - want to see the kind of next parts of
13:02 - the tutorial where we make our ball
13:03 - actually bounce off the ground then
13:05 - leave a like and leave a comment just
13:08 - saying you want to see it and I'll be
13:09 - sure to do that later on so yep thank
13:12 - you guys and I'll see you in the next
13:14 - video

Cleaned transcript:

the angle we're gonna have to use a bit of trig so I already have a function I've wrote here because I didn't want to have to do it on camera so I'm just gonna copy and paste it and I'm gonna go through it and give you as a second to copy it down so I'm just gonna paste it under here and it's called find angle so this is the function right here it pretty much takes a position and the position is well the position of our of our mouse and then vs. the golf ball so it already has a position the golf ball we just have to give it the position of the mouse and then what it does here is it tries to tangent the angle to figure or tangent the the golf balls X&Y to figure out the length of that line to start with right and if you can't do this so it can't arc arc tangent this then it's just gonna do math dot pi divided by two because the only time that math thought that this won't work is if it's if it's a certain value in radians so if you don't understand radians I'm gonna pull up a unit circle here quickly actually pretty much every degree has a Radian equivalent so 30 degrees is PI over six 45 degrees is PI over four and you can look on here and so on you don't really have to understand exactly how they work or why we use them but in one full circle we have two pi radians 180 degrees is pi radians and so on so you're gonna see that I have some like math dot PI's and stuff in here that's just because that's the way radiance work you don't really have to understand them but here's unit circle anyways if you want to look at it so we'll close that out so let me just go over this again I think I messed it up so pretty much the arctangent is what we use in for radians to figure out the angle if we're given two positions in a right triangle so let me just pull this up for a second I'm steadily good 0 for now and so if we have a line like this then that means if we go directly down and we go directly across then we can find the two components of those lines so the x value and the y value now if we know those two components or those two lines the values there and we know that it's a right triangle then we can use those two components to figure out the angle here that would be down here to the line it's hard to show you because my mouse is what's creating the line but I hope you can understand that so we're gonna we try to do that now with the with the arctan tangent if that doesn't work then we're just gonna default to this because that would mean that the one case where it doesn't work is is this alright so now this is where we determine what direction we're actually shooting it so once we figure out the angle now we have to determine if we're shooting left if we're shooting right if we're going down if we're going down left just copy this down here don't exactly you don't have to worry exactly what it does this just figure out what quadrant your mouse is in so looking at the unit circle we have four quadrants just figures out what quadrants in so copy this down pause the video and then we're gonna move on to the rest here so what I'm just gonna do for angle isn't I do find angle and then we're gonna put pause in here and pause is gonna be again the position of our mouse like that alright so now we've got that part down and we're gonna find the angle we're gonna find the power and we're gonna set where we're shooting from now we have to get the physics involved so we've used all the math now with the trig now we have to use the physics to determine exactly where the ball is going to be moving and how far at what time so we're gonna go up here to the beginning of our function and we're just gonna do a new thing here we're gonna say if shoot like this so that means the ball is in motion we're shooting the ball then we are going to what we're gonna have to do is now check if the ball has already collided with the ground or not so we know if we should continue shooting it or if we should stop the ball so I'm just gonna say if golf ball dot Y is less than 500 minus golf ball dart radius so this just means that we've now gone past the bottom of the screen or we're about to go past the bottom of the screen we don't want to continue moving the ball because that's our ground so it's gonna hit there and then ideally it would bounce but that's gonna be in the next part of the video now we're just gonna do time plus equals 0.05 the reason I'm doing this is because that's gonna be the increment of time that makes it look like it's moving properly Kanna so 0.05 seconds is what that's gonna be P oh this is just gonna be position I just don't want to override this position here so I just do this and we're gonna do full dot ball path don't worry we're gonna go back up and fix that method we're just gonna plug this in for now we're gonna do XY power angle time like that now we're going to set our positions or change them for the golf ball so golf ball that x equals P o zero and golf ball dot y equals po1 okay so I know I went really fast let's recap here quickly so pretty much what happens here if the user clicks the mouse then we're gonna check to make sure he's not already shooting the ball if he is not we're gonna set shoot equal to true we're gonna determine where he had shot the ball at so wherever that golf ball is at that time we're gonna set time equal to zero so we're gonna reset that to make sure that it is at zero we're gonna do power we're gonna set the power based on the length of the line and we're just gonna divide it by eight so it's not too big of a number then we're gonna find the angle between our mouse and the ball now the way that we do that is by using this function that I've written in here again you don't have to understand how this works but just copy it out and then we now need to do this ball power so this ball path function is what's gonna use the physics to determine how the ball is gonna move through the air so let's get into this now and this is going to be kind of the end or the wrapping up part of the video now so we're just gonna start by doing this we need to find the two components of our movement so we have a X velocity and a Y velocity now the way that a ball moves in physics in two dimensions is each second it moves X by us X by a certain amount of degrees and it moves Y by a certain amount or not degrees a certain amount right so it can move X by five maybe and it's moving Y by two or it's moving X by seven and moving down Y by three so we need to figure out exactly how that is gonna work so now that we have the angle and the power we know the diagonal power but we have to know what the velocity is going to be going X and what the velocity is gonna be going Y so we'll figure that out now to do that we simply need to just do math or cosine and then of angle multiplied by our power and this gives us our X velocity and to find the Y velocity we just do map both sine of our angle and our angle is in radians by the way that's this is y in Python all the mouth stuff it uses radians unless you convert it into degrees and then we have math dot sine angle times power so that gives us our Y component so now we go down and we have to calculate how far we moved on the xdirection and how far you moved on the ydirection now the X Direction is easy because we're moving at a constant velocity right so there's no gravity moving left and right gravity only pushes us downward so the X Direction is easy we just do our velocity of x times our time so if say for example if you're moving five meters per second and you're it was two seconds into your motion then how far would you be you would be ten meters because you moved five meters per second right now our Y is a little bit more complicated now this is just a formula you can find us online it's motion with downwards acceleration so since our acceleration of gravity is negative 9.8 meters per second down we need to use that in this formula so we're just gonna start by doing valve Y times time plus now these brackets are very important so make sure that you do not forget them we're gonna do another set of brackets and now I know gravity is usually negative 9.8 meters per second squared but I like to set my gravity to about half of that just so it doesn't move down as quickly if you want to be more realistic you can change that number you can play with it all these numbers you can play with and it's just gonna give you a different kind of motion x squared divided by 2 that so make sure you guys copy this out and it looks exactly like this otherwise it's not gonna work properly again you can change this number but not keep it the same and now we need to calculate our new X and our new Y so to do this we do new X is equal to and then we're just gonna round this here so we don't get crazy decimal numbers we're new distance X so that's how much we moved in the xdirection plus our initial starting direction our starting position and then remember in Python how moving positive actually moves you downwards rather than how you would think it works like if you're subtracting you go downwards so in this case we actually have to subtract to move upwards we're going to start Y minus and then our distance of y and then we're gonna return that value in a tuple let's go return new X and new Y again we went kind of fast there but that's how this works this is the physics that we're incorporating into this and that just gets our X component or Y component and then we can tell how to move our ball and this is exactly how projectile motion works now we're not really bothered about finding like the max distance or the max height we just want to display this on the screen so that we can see it if we wanted to figure that out that would be a different tutorial okay so we've done that now and let's just check the rear code and make sure that everything should be working so we have if shoot then we're gonna check to make sure that our ball is not shouldn't should be moving so it's not like below the screen then we're gonna move it we need to add one thing here which is so once our ball hits the ground or goes lower than the ground we need to stop moving so we're gonna shoot it goes false and we're gonna set its position so that we make sure it's able to shoot next time so it's higher on the ground reach go golf ball dot Y is equal to 494 and that's initially what we set it to here right and that should be about it so I'm just checking through here quickly make sure it looks good and I think it does so let's try this out okay so we have the line and let's see what happens when I click there we go and you can see the ball shoots around the screen now you'll notice this moves kind of fast right if we don't want it to move as fast there's a few things that we can do to fix that so the first thing we're gonna do to fix that is by changing this number here now this time is well exactly what it does by how much you increment it is how fast the program's going to go so if I change this to 0.01 and I run the program you'll notice that we go very very slow like that if I change it to for example 0.1 and I run it then we go really really really fast so you guys have to play around with this number it's gonna be different depending on your computer as well I know it seems weird but pretty much how fast your processor is is gonna determine how fast this while loop runs so there are a few things you can do to set exactly how fast the while loop runs but we're not gonna worry about that right now so just play with this time number I usually go anywhere from 0.01 to 0.1 depending on how fast your computer is and you can see that 0.025 seems to be working well for me now the longer that your line gets the more that your ball moves so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I know it's probably not the best I tried to go at a reasonable pace but again we can't spend too long going over everything this involves physics and involves math is pretty complex so if you guys understood it then give yourself a pat on the back and if you want to see the kind of next parts of the tutorial where we make our ball actually bounce off the ground then leave a like and leave a comment just saying you want to see it and I'll be sure to do that later on so yep thank you guys and I'll see you in the next video
