With timestamps:

00:00 - if you're playing game of chess and the
00:01 - server goes down or you get disconnected
00:02 - or something like that um but yeah so
00:07 - anyway slip I'll be live right now okay
00:16 - so I'm sorry I just had an issue with
00:18 - the stream I don't know what you guys
00:19 - heard or what you didn't hear let me
00:21 - know but again online multiplayer chess
00:24 - we're gonna be playing this today
00:25 - there's a bunch of bugs we need to
00:26 - figure out we're gonna be doing that for
00:28 - the first 15 20 minutes please don't get
00:30 - too frustrated if we go through stuff
00:32 - and I've already repeated this I'm sorry
00:33 - but um I don't know if you guys can see
00:35 - me or not again this is always a bit
00:37 - buggy alright so first of all before I
00:39 - get too far into the stream I need to
00:41 - give a massive shout-out to cherry
00:43 - servers for hooking me up with a really
00:45 - awesome server for today's stream I'm
00:47 - gonna be using the server for a few
00:48 - videos in future series as well and
00:51 - anyways just massive shout out to cherry
00:53 - servers definitely go check out their
00:55 - website here you can rent servers for
00:57 - like 10 15 cents an hour they're really
01:00 - good they have an awesome support team
01:01 - and they've just been a pleasure to work
01:03 - with so massive shout to them definitely
01:04 - check out their website there's a link
01:06 - in the description and again just thank
01:08 - you guys so much from cherry servers
01:09 - because without you this would not have
01:11 - been paulus have been possible alright
01:13 - so now let me show you guys how you can
01:16 - actually connect and start playing this
01:18 - game so a little tutorial first so that
01:21 - everyone knows how to kind of get set up
01:22 - here so if you're tuning into the stream
01:24 - later just I guess rewind back and see
01:26 - this but anyways if you go to my github
01:28 - link in the description link in the
01:30 - pinned comment you should see a page
01:33 - that looks like this now there's a
01:35 - readme file here and it literally just
01:37 - goes through exactly how to do
01:38 - everything
01:39 - so what you need to do is download this
01:41 - repository and run the game dot PI file
01:43 - now I tried to make this as intuitive as
01:46 - possible
01:46 - and when you run the game top high file
01:48 - I wrote a script that should
01:49 - automatically install PI game and pip
01:51 - for you if this doesn't work you're
01:54 - gonna have to mess with installing pip
01:55 - and PI game yourself again let me know
01:57 - if there's any issues use the stream
01:59 - chat use the github chat for issues I'm
02:02 - gonna be checking and we're kind of just
02:03 - gonna be tweaking things to the first
02:04 - 15-20 minutes so please you know bear
02:07 - with me on that guys
02:09 - but anyways follow this instructions try
02:11 - to connect the servers live right now if
02:12 - you double
02:13 - click the game top high file you should
02:15 - actually get hooked up I can see a few
02:16 - people joining on the server right now
02:18 - and before we you know go too far I will
02:21 - kind of walk through some of the code
02:23 - and how this works but if you guys want
02:24 - to go in the background and kind of be
02:25 - listening to this while I go through the
02:28 - instructions feel free we've already got
02:29 - 4 people connected to games going and
02:32 - yeah we'll just be going through all
02:34 - that so do this get this working github
02:36 - link in the description I'm just
02:37 - repeating this because everyone is like
02:40 - just joining in the stream so I want to
02:41 - make sure people see it if they're just
02:42 - coming on now but remind people in the
02:45 - stream chat and all of that so the
02:47 - server specs that I actually got I got a
02:49 - 4 core or starting out 4 core 4 Xeon
02:52 - processors to 1080 TI's the one i have
02:56 - is actually only 16 gigabytes of ram but
02:59 - i was supposed to get 64 but like
03:01 - something messed up with that and then i
03:02 - think i have like what do you call it
03:05 - some i don't know how much space at like
03:07 - 250 gigabyte SSD or something uh alright
03:10 - let me just see what's going on here i'm
03:12 - running into a few issues on the server
03:13 - again guys i gotta fix a bunch of stuff
03:15 - as we go through but that's what I'm
03:17 - gonna be doing now just fixing some of
03:18 - the stuff on the server side and just
03:20 - bear with me keep connecting the server
03:22 - try to play the games if you run into
03:23 - bugs please let me know inside because
03:26 - I'm relying on you guys to help me test
03:28 - this out and then I also implemented a
03:30 - spectator mode into this because it
03:33 - we're getting key errors here yeah you
03:37 - guys can't connect Kay I'm gonna shut
03:39 - down the server right now guys I'll be
03:40 - back on in one second oh just there's a
03:42 - key error I know how to fix this it just
03:44 - gonna take a second because when you
03:45 - guys are connecting to the games it's
03:47 - just it's a little buggy here I'm so Len
03:49 - of games ok I see here
03:53 - so if connections watches 2 equals 0
03:55 - yeah so again guys just get that stuff
03:58 - going and then we'll we'll get this all
04:00 - working here I just gotta figure out
04:01 - this issue because I have something
04:03 - where like each game is represented by a
04:05 - key in the dictionary if you join the
04:07 - key era can sometimes be off um and and
04:11 - only that so we'll have to fix and work
04:13 - with this what I might actually do is
04:17 - just get it so that
04:19 - this is gonna be a little bit difficult
04:21 - G equals zero let's see here I think I'm
04:27 - just gonna pick a game that doesn't have
04:29 - two connections on it and add you on
04:30 - that how big is the foot you guys asked
04:32 - me all these questions I'll get to them
04:33 - in a second I just really want to get
04:34 - this working with the key areas I
04:36 - haven't had many people on it at once so
04:38 - again we're gonna have some issues going
04:39 - as we get through here is the line of
04:42 - games minus zero is this open source
04:45 - yeah guys this is open source you can go
04:47 - look at everything on github okay
04:50 - so let's just get a list of all the keys
04:53 - and then we'll assign a player based on
04:55 - the amount of connections oh we
04:57 - shouldn't do it based on connections
04:58 - because then connections are just 2
05:01 - equals equals zero yeah so this was an
05:03 - issue I knew I was gonna run into
05:05 - creating new games so this is gonna be
05:09 - difficult to create new games and assign
05:11 - people into the games I haven't had this
05:14 - many people connect and even with you
05:15 - guys like 10 20 people connecting it um
05:17 - it just broke here so we'll have to see
05:19 - how to fix this so what I was trying to
05:22 - do right now is say after every 2 people
05:24 - connect it um creates a new game but
05:27 - what was happening was if people are
05:28 - connecting and they're just instantly
05:29 - leaving and then it wasn't working okay
05:31 - let's just do it we'll do one more test
05:33 - run with this server running and then
05:35 - see if we can get this to to work ok
05:38 - guys to try to connect to the game
05:41 - connection reset by P try to connect I'm
05:43 - gonna be monitoring this server here and
05:45 - I might even connect in a second as you
05:47 - might get my spectator mode to work but
05:48 - I need you guys to connect before I can
05:50 - see if everything is actually working or
05:51 - not
05:52 - again if you're unfamiliar with how to
05:54 - do this this should be the repo that you
05:57 - download should look like this except
05:58 - you want to have this server file most
05:59 - likely and then just double click on
06:01 - game and it should load you up into the
06:03 - chess game I'm gonna show you guys what
06:05 - it looks like in a second but I need
06:06 - enough people to connect it I can get in
06:08 - what's called spectator mode let me see
06:10 - what I can do this now other player left
06:13 - spectator mode is not working so I gotta
06:16 - fix that too Oh a bunch of people are
06:19 - leaving new player connected connection
06:21 - reset by pier number of connections
06:23 - through a number of games to let me know
06:25 - if this is working for you guys or not
06:26 - if you're in games or not because
06:29 - again I don't know game one ended player
06:36 - none left game one kierra player left
06:39 - yeah okay I don't think this is working
06:40 - yet guys so we gotta give it a second
06:42 - here if you're in the game please let me
06:44 - know in the chat guys I haven't heard
06:45 - set had anyone tell me about any issues
06:47 - or not in the chat yet so I gotta see
06:50 - okay I'm gonna stop the server and we're
06:52 - just gonna get this this fixed currently
06:54 - because this is a bit of an issue so I
06:57 - was having this thing where I was like
06:58 - deleting games I think I'm just gonna
07:00 - stop deleting games and just add more
07:02 - keys into the dictionary so when I
07:05 - create a new game so game connections
07:08 - but oh that's why it's not working okay
07:11 - so we'll say current underscore game
07:16 - underscore ID again guys just give me a
07:17 - minute or two let me know if you have
07:18 - any bugs please I really do care if you
07:21 - have the bugs because I need to fix them
07:22 - yeah I know the server's offline is
07:23 - going online in a second okay so we'll
07:25 - say G equals current underscore game
07:31 - underscore ID and we'll just say after
07:34 - every two connections so it'll say like
07:36 - yeah if connections modules two equals
07:39 - zero
07:39 - then we'll just create a new game with
07:40 - current game ID so current current
07:44 - underscore game ID underscore game
07:49 - underscore ID and then we'll add one to
07:51 - that okay so that needs to be
07:54 - incremented plus equals one and then G
08:01 - equals current game ID and then Ralad we
08:04 - won't delete any games which is what I
08:06 - was doing at some point here F Dell yeah
08:10 - we don't need to do this game ended get
08:14 - rid of that
08:16 - okay so let's try this now I just got to
08:19 - push this code over to the server and
08:22 - then we should be able to actually run
08:24 - that desktop chess game server I'm
08:28 - hoping this is as easy as the fixes
08:30 - because if it's not then you know we're
08:32 - gonna be run into some issues here I'm
08:33 - also just gonna modify this specs file
08:36 - all right
08:40 - okay run that no it's not what I want to
08:43 - do same thing again okay there we go all
08:49 - right let's go guys connect now and see
08:52 - if this is working
08:53 - I've already have two games new player
08:55 - connected number of connections 1 number
08:57 - of games
08:57 - oh yeah the number of games output here
09:00 - is gonna be wrong but that's fine let me
09:01 - try to connect now I had this all
09:02 - working before I don't know what's going
09:04 - on I think it's just you guys are
09:05 - flooding me with games and I don't know
09:06 - I didn't code the server well enough to
09:08 - handle this let's run a game name there
09:13 - we go so I'm waiting for player let's
09:14 - see if someone else joins in if I can
09:15 - get in the game with someone here so
09:17 - whoever's gonna join next is gonna be in
09:18 - my game oh there we go I'm in a game ok
09:20 - let's select let me play ok um his turn
09:26 - holy crap a lot of you guys are joining
09:28 - oh my god ok well I did not expect this
09:33 - to happen I did not expect this many
09:35 - people to have to join the game
09:37 - immediately Jesus okay yeah this will be
09:40 - interesting to see if this works if you
09:41 - guys can see my this is my server screen
09:43 - right now oh my god okay people are
09:46 - leaving people are joining yeah oh this
09:48 - is gonna be really interesting okay
09:50 - whoever's playing against me needs to
09:52 - make a move because I'm waiting for them
09:54 - right now I'm gonna have to leave the
09:55 - game if they take too long holy crap
09:59 - Jesus
10:03 - yeah if you guys can't tell us a little
10:05 - bit
10:06 - some guy named himself hey Tim Tims time
10:08 - oh I'm waiting player to left this game
10:10 - clearly block is winner okay let me just
10:12 - do this again um oh my god okay I'll run
10:20 - through all this code works but I want
10:21 - to see if this is gonna work Tim let's
10:24 - run a game here okay I'm with blue jay
10:27 - all right blue jay your turn buddy let's
10:28 - go what's okay he moved there on black
10:34 - alright let's see if he can play with me
10:36 - by the way guys you see this mug
10:37 - available for purchase you can go right
10:40 - underneath he wears it underneath the
10:42 - description you should be able to see
10:43 - that so I'm just testing out the game
10:45 - this is what it looks like I'm in a game
10:47 - right now with blue jay it seems to be
10:48 - working but yeah let me know if you guys
10:52 - what's going on with you ran out of
10:53 - input on pickling stack under flow
10:55 - service server offline okay that's an
10:58 - issue there's gonna be a lot of stuff
10:59 - that I'm gonna need to fix here and by
11:01 - the way I'm just gonna like don't get
11:02 - too attached to your chess game because
11:04 - I'm gonna have to shut down the server
11:05 - at random times and fix stuff but I
11:07 - don't know I think this is pretty
11:08 - interesting and you guys can see the
11:09 - kind of I look at my server code right
11:12 - now look what's happening look how many
11:13 - people are connected I have these
11:16 - connections are wrong we have 40 not
11:18 - that's wrong for games to like people
11:20 - are just joining leaving you can see
11:21 - this guy left game 48 alright
11:26 - see I just keep joining in guys we'll
11:28 - keep testing this and this probably is
11:31 - about like 24 hours worth of coding
11:33 - because the stream that I did it in I
11:35 - only went for 18 hours
11:37 - did I not move what is happening here
11:44 - yeah this is not correct
11:48 - I'm trying to join a game but I'm still
11:50 - waiting server offline yeah this is
11:52 - gonna be a little bit of fixing so the
11:54 - stream might go longer than I expected
11:55 - um okay let me quit this game
11:58 - he can be the winner of that one and
12:00 - let's get in a new one and see what I
12:02 - can get going here there's some latency
12:03 - issues here um oh my god
12:07 - okay join all right I am block there
12:13 - turn who's going here
12:14 - Sahil is playing that right now joins
12:18 - time oh my god
12:20 - okay yeah so clearly this this is not
12:25 - working at the same level that I I
12:27 - thought it would well we'll see if we
12:31 - can get this going soon oh my god okay
12:35 - guys let me know your your errors please
12:37 - send them in the chat because I need to
12:39 - know what is going on here Tim see
12:43 - player one time Tim time okay I can move
12:48 - but it still says player one I don't
12:49 - even know if I'm in a game with someone
12:51 - oh my god okay he is going so I heated
12:57 - messages named himself thought so when
13:01 - you guys load up it should ask you to
13:03 - input like a name Adam at some point but
13:07 - yeah let me know how this is going for
13:08 - you guys for me this seems to be working
13:09 - like okay obviously there's some bugs I
13:11 - got a tune out here oh hey Reb you thank
13:14 - you for the $1 super chat man appreciate
13:16 - that but yeah I mean we'll see if we can
13:21 - get this going
13:22 - and these seems like the naming thing
13:25 - seems to have some issues too
13:28 - yeah I was trying to add some castling
13:31 - in here as well after but I was getting
13:34 - some kind of issues with the castling so
13:36 - we'll see like if you guys try to castle
13:38 - and see if your castling works and let
13:40 - me know so I'm using a bun - I cannot
13:43 - resize window it's bigger on my laptop
13:45 - screen oh god sorry about that I can't
13:47 - really help you with that um well why
13:50 - wouldn't he take my that's an
13:52 - interesting decision ok let's take that
13:55 - I'm not very good at chess either by the
13:57 - way guys I don't know why I decided to
13:59 - create chess but I did
14:04 - let's see here okay how many guys have
14:06 - we got in here right now seven
14:08 - connections 71 games that's because
14:10 - we're not clearing games I'm just
14:11 - incrementing IDs of games when will you
14:14 - continue the tower game at some point
14:16 - I'll continue the tower game where's my
14:17 - pie game script my turn
14:19 - hmm okay so this is working for me guys
14:23 - let me know if this is working for you
14:24 - again people are gonna be leaving
14:25 - joining all that kind of stuff and
14:29 - showed it to review thank you for the
14:32 - super chat 5 bucks again loving your
14:34 - videos and helped me so much in my
14:35 - programming journey appreciate you mate
14:37 - thank you man I appreciate you that
14:39 - super chats awesome means a lot man
14:40 - thank you
14:41 - okay guys I'm gonna do I'm gonna start
14:43 - writing some more code so I apologize
14:45 - whoever I'm playing right now playing
14:47 - against right now I'm gonna write some
14:48 - code to hopefully fix the server a
14:50 - little bit but again I need you guys to
14:51 - let me know in the chat if it's working
14:53 - or if it's not because that's gonna be
14:55 - like that I need I need to know that
14:59 - otherwise this is not gonna go very well
15:01 - you guys need to tell me what's going
15:02 - wrong with all these videos try to
15:04 - castle as well because castling is like
15:06 - a huge thing that I was trying to work
15:08 - on earlier and I want to see if that's
15:10 - working if you don't know what castle is
15:13 - it's like when you switch the king with
15:14 - the rook and the way that I did is you
15:15 - have to click the rook to go to the king
15:17 - so what I want to do now is number of
15:22 - games should really just be equal to
15:24 - number of connections over to I don't
15:28 - even know I don't even think I could
15:29 - show the number of games running pickle
15:31 - Dada was truncated load key 8 server
15:34 - offline Oh God okay um pickle Dada was
15:39 - truncated that one's it I have to change
15:42 - that now take a look okay let's just do
15:46 - that
15:49 - um alright so for those of you that
15:51 - don't know how this works essentially I
15:54 - have these these are all my scripts okay
15:56 - and what happens is I have this server
15:58 - code running on this external linux
16:00 - server it is this one right here that
16:02 - you guys can see and it's handling all
16:05 - the connections in and out of this game
16:07 - now what it's doing is it's storing the
16:09 - games on the server and then it's
16:12 - sending those games like the data for
16:14 - those games to each player so what
16:17 - happens is when someone moves in one
16:18 - game it will move like in the other game
16:21 - that they're connected with now the
16:23 - issue that I'm having right now is
16:24 - having all these different games running
16:26 - at once I obviously haven't programmed
16:28 - the server to work well enough to do
16:30 - this so you can see like people just
16:32 - keep disconnecting and reconnecting but
16:35 - I was in a game and it was working fine
16:37 - for me so I mean I don't know what like
16:40 - is wrong with other people unless people
16:42 - just keep leaving immediately and
16:43 - playing against other people and if you
16:45 - want to post like formal issues code
16:47 - whatever on the issue page on the github
16:50 - then I can look on that as well and I'm
16:52 - gonna be updating that get up if I make
16:54 - changes to the code here so I just want
16:58 - to print the number of connections when
17:01 - people connect now and when people
17:04 - disconnect I'm - saying the connections
17:08 - let's see here oh okay so keeping track
17:13 - of the connections is something that I
17:14 - need to do better now - because if you
17:17 - for some reason like if you got this
17:20 - exception does it break when you get
17:23 - this exception no it doesn't break hmm
17:28 - hmm if not gaming games okay
17:36 - all right I think the server codes fine
17:38 - we're just gonna keep testing this
17:39 - running server with two connections we
17:41 - got two games going right now try to
17:43 - stay in the game if you guys can for
17:45 - like a fair amount of time just to test
17:48 - out if this is working now I have this
17:50 - spectator mode that I had implemented
17:52 - but for some reason the spectator mode
17:54 - wasn't working I'm gonna try to fix that
17:57 - and also this is the main game script
18:00 - and what I did at the top here is I did
18:03 - all this jazz so that if you don't have
18:06 - pip or you don't have PI game installed
18:08 - what happens is it automatically
18:10 - installs it for you so it just
18:12 - implements this thing there's actually a
18:13 - script called get pip and it has the
18:16 - bytecode for pip you can see it's like
18:18 - 21,000 lines or something and so you
18:21 - don't actually have to install pip
18:22 - because I have the actual pip in the
18:24 - file and then what happens is it imports
18:26 - that file and then it tries to use that
18:29 - to install pion how can I talk to it
18:32 - maybe working because you're running the
18:34 - server on your network no no the
18:35 - server's no guys this server is sorry
18:37 - this server is running on like an
18:40 - external server like this servers in
18:42 - like Lithuania or something I don't even
18:44 - know where it is but it's um it's not
18:46 - working it's not running on my network
18:47 - so you guys will be able to join the
18:49 - game and I can see like hey - left game
18:51 - J bros left game number of connections -
18:54 - number of games that should be changed
18:56 - I'm gonna restart the server guys
18:58 - because I just need to change one thing
19:01 - here and modify so we don't I don't get
19:07 - this weird game output anymore because
19:09 - that game output is not correct now I
19:12 - had this really cool spectator mode that
19:14 - I coded and it was working and then now
19:16 - it's not working so that's great but
19:18 - we'll see if I can get it to work I just
19:20 - want to comment out this comment save X
19:26 - okay so I'm gonna try to work on getting
19:29 - this what do you call it's the spectator
19:34 - mode to work from my end you guys just
19:36 - keep playing and let me know again if
19:37 - you have issues and we're just gonna
19:39 - peace through this and hopefully by the
19:40 - time we hit like in the next 10-15
19:41 - minutes everything will be working and I
19:43 - can just play against some of you guys
19:44 - and just chat with you on the live
19:46 - stream you if you guys are new here to
19:47 - join the game link in the description go
19:49 - to the
19:50 - Hubb I think I'd probably still have it
19:52 - up and there's instructions on how to
19:54 - get the game running on your thing you
19:56 - can skip step 1 as it should just
19:58 - install PI game for you automatically
20:00 - this is the repo and I haven't modified
20:03 - anything from the game end so it should
20:05 - just work for you guys now I'm gonna try
20:07 - to get the spectator thing working
20:08 - because for me it's having this
20:10 - spectator thing this spectator issue
20:13 - hey guys left game 7 hey Tim left game 8
20:18 - J Bros so guys oh you guys hate Tim J
20:21 - Bros 2 are you guys leaving the game or
20:22 - is it kicking you from the game that's
20:24 - something that I need to know and like
20:27 - connection reset by Pierre I don't know
20:28 - what issue that is there's a ton of
20:30 - stuff that I don't know so we have to
20:32 - see like if this is working or not J
20:35 - Bros I see you in the chat are you
20:37 - leaving the games or are you being
20:39 - kicked from the game and thank you for
20:41 - congratulations on 30 K um okay so let's
20:45 - upload update this file you guys can't
20:49 - know it's a nut so I'm gonna have to
20:51 - hide that C this year I'm just gonna
20:58 - have someone just send me a message on
20:59 - discord here so I'm just gonna have to
21:00 - grab this here so keep going guys I'm
21:08 - reading the chat if you have any
21:09 - questions let me know but if you have
21:11 - the errors please send them because we
21:12 - get we're just going through the
21:13 - debugging stage I know it's kind of
21:14 - boring right now but that's all we can
21:16 - really do until I figure out what these
21:19 - issues are but it does look to be
21:21 - working like fairly well to be quite
21:23 - honest with you so we'll see you know if
21:26 - we can get this going
21:30 - alright
21:32 - hey Tim left game eights number of
21:34 - connections for its kicking me kicked me
21:37 - out a game it's kicking me okay um how
21:41 - is it kicking you guys out of the game
21:42 - is it just randomly are you just
21:44 - randomly being kicked or what's going on
21:46 - is it like disconnect disconnect
21:49 - disconnect what would what will happen
21:53 - in some instances is you'll be kicked if
21:55 - the other player leaves so that could be
21:56 - the instance but you should see a
21:58 - message that says like you've you've
22:00 - been kicked from the game if once I get
22:02 - this spectator mode going I'll be able
22:04 - to do it a bit easier like looking
22:06 - through the games okay here a bunch of
22:08 - people just joined and a bunch of people
22:09 - got kicked connection reset player W
22:12 - wanting game 9 Xen burr left game 9 okay
22:16 - let me run a script here and let's see
22:17 - if we can get this going
22:18 - randomly kicked yeah um okay one second
22:23 - guys holy crap people are just
22:25 - disconnecting connecting left game 17
22:29 - player none left game 17 hmm okay let me
22:33 - print out the errors from the server
22:35 - side and then I'll try to fix some of
22:36 - them I'm just gonna restart the script
22:38 - guys sorry about that
22:41 - okay so server should be printing these
22:46 - exceptions so I have this try here if
22:50 - it's a server end issue it should just
22:52 - print them if it's not hmm let's see cuz
22:55 - when you disconnect that either men's
22:57 - means you left or it means that you know
22:59 - something happens so let's see here if
23:01 - not game okay let's run the server again
23:11 - okay - so it seems to work like at the
23:14 - beginning somewhat players end bar left
23:16 - game one right like I don't know if
23:18 - that's randomly kicking him or if he's
23:20 - joining in the game um let's see here
23:24 - let me get in the game here hmm so my
23:34 - spectator mode thing isn't working
23:35 - expected your luck game zero let's see
23:37 - if I can get this in here yeah I know
23:44 - it's giving me all this um spectator
23:47 - left game zero
23:48 - oh it's cuz it's okay that'd probably be
23:51 - why let's see your game yeah okay I'm
23:57 - gonna have to reset the server one more
23:58 - time guys sorry about that
24:01 - just delete that alright see if I can
24:13 - get in one here Tim okay there we go
24:17 - there turn I'm playing against this guy
24:19 - now let's see how long I can get this to
24:20 - go for and then I'll see what's going on
24:22 - with your guys games but for me when I
24:24 - do this it seems to be working fairly
24:27 - well to be honest for like my game end
24:30 - but I don't know also these times are
24:32 - messed up p1p2 so I oh this just changed
24:36 - hey Tim's time Zen bars game so the
24:41 - names are getting messed up that's it
24:42 - make a kickin tag on server I don't I
24:45 - don't randomly kick people that's the
24:47 - thing I don't know why people people are
24:49 - getting kicked out he's moving that okay
24:51 - so there's some latency issues here as
24:53 - well hmm okay but like I'm playing
24:57 - against someone here whoever's playing
24:58 - against me let me know
25:05 - if any of you guys are like successfully
25:08 - playing a game of chest against someone
25:09 - um let me know that and that would be
25:13 - helpful to know yeah see now I can't
25:15 - like I can't move right now
25:17 - it just seems frozen connection reset
25:23 - hey Tim's okay I'm gonna quit that and
25:27 - let him go if you want to quit the game
25:29 - it's better if you click Q to quit um
25:32 - hmm disconnect disconnect player to
25:35 - connection reset I don't know what this
25:37 - connection reset by peer means I'm gonna
25:38 - look that up okay keyboard interrupt
25:42 - let's run this again you guys can keep
25:44 - messing with that let me know the errors
25:46 - I'm gonna look up some stuff here
25:48 - connection reset by peer high amount of
25:53 - traffic okay so it may actually be a
25:57 - traffic issue that's that's causing this
25:59 - I'm just gonna make a modification in
26:02 - here and see if I can can fix this by
26:08 - just getting rid of I have like a timers
26:11 - yeah I don't know if that's gonna work I
26:16 - don't know if this is a traffic issue or
26:19 - what's wrong here I'm the winner tag on
26:22 - the server yeah okay
26:25 - connection reset by peer let's see air
26:28 - 404
26:47 - hmm seems a server-side limits the
26:53 - amount of requests per time out as a
26:55 - security issue you need to guess how
26:57 - many maybe using the script with a
26:58 - counter and adjust your script to
27:00 - surpass the limit okay so what the issue
27:02 - I'm having apparently and why you guys
27:03 - are getting kicked is because there's
27:06 - too much traffic going on right now
27:07 - there's too many games running at once
27:09 - which is something I anticipated so what
27:11 - I'm gonna need to do is just make it so
27:13 - that the refresh rate to the server is
27:15 - slower but that means that it's gonna be
27:17 - like whale a gear when you guys are
27:19 - running this so I'm gonna increase it um
27:21 - what you guys are gonna have to do is
27:23 - read download this github repo just
27:27 - redownload it and just run game 2 up
27:29 - high again I I just made the change
27:31 - so just redownload and try to it you can
27:33 - see like people are just getting holy
27:34 - crap
27:37 - Jesus okay umm redownload the repo I'm
27:41 - shutting the server down right now if
27:43 - you see you guys have a chance to do
27:44 - this and we'll see if this fixes it a
27:46 - little bit if it doesn't honestly I
27:48 - don't really know what's going on but I
27:49 - what I really want to get the spectator
27:52 - mode thing working so I wanted to go
27:53 - through and see this in my mind this was
27:54 - gonna work a lot smoother than it has
27:56 - but I mean you know not everything works
27:57 - perfectly
27:59 - I also need why not my ask you with the
28:01 - server on the web so the traffic's
28:03 - better no man I'm not gonna recode a
28:04 - server right now I'm just like messing
28:07 - with it as we speak games zero board
28:10 - okay so we need to get rid of this first
28:12 - of all okay so first thing we should do
28:17 - if connections modulus to equals it with
28:19 - zero current underscore game ID plus
28:22 - equals one game's current ID okay but
28:26 - then connections goes down with someone
28:28 - else joins which means current game ID
28:31 - hmm there's got to be a better way to
28:34 - connect people into games because what's
28:37 - happening is like someone will connect
28:38 - and someone will leave and the
28:39 - connections will be lower and then
28:40 - you're gonna get in a different game
28:42 - based on your connections which we don't
28:45 - want so create a new game know that
28:49 - current game ID plus equals 1 if
28:52 - connections by just 2 equals 0
28:56 - okay let's see here make a server
28:58 - handler for games yeah I have I have oh
29:00 - yeah print create new game I could do
29:02 - that but redownload that guy's for right
29:06 - now I'm gonna modify it on my end too
29:07 - and see if all I did is just add a timer
29:11 - essentially so that it doesn't it goes
29:13 - slower and when it's grabbing
29:16 - information which means it's gonna be
29:17 - kind of annoying but yeah you guys you
29:19 - guys will see how it works
29:21 - invalid game okay
29:24 - disconnect spectator left game that's
29:26 - spectator mode let's see an exception so
29:31 - if you leave while the peer is reset
29:38 - okay this does Python a private and
29:41 - public instances no I'm just trying to
29:46 - find a better way to assign people into
29:49 - games so that we keep hmm like you
29:55 - should really be deleting the old games
29:57 - keep so the current game ID is like that
30:00 - makes sense you add to the current game
30:03 - ID I can delete the other game which
30:08 - will kick someone out I don't know how
30:13 - exactly to go about doing this um let's
30:16 - see so what I had before I want to look
30:22 - at what I had before on the server
30:23 - actually let me go to the github and
30:24 - have a look at this and maybe I can just
30:27 - redownload that code and try again here
30:29 - from server okay let's go to chess game
30:33 - that's fine server okay so what I had
30:39 - essentially was let's see here oh no I
30:43 - didn't have the tries and except though
30:44 - if like for some reason something didn't
30:46 - work like you got disconnected it would
30:48 - delete that instance of the game which
30:51 - would cause the other person to get
30:52 - disconnected that worked for me when I
30:54 - just had like two or three people going
30:56 - at once so I don't know why it's not
30:59 - working now let's let me download this
31:03 - new
31:07 - cept exception okay and commit that all
31:23 - right I'm just gonna literally copy that
31:24 - it's got our raw okay we're gonna just
31:34 - try what I had last time again I said
31:37 - I'm gonna get rid of this address cuz I
31:39 - don't want you guys to see people's IP
31:42 - addresses new connection connection
31:47 - we'll get rid of this data as well
31:48 - because we don't actually we can print
31:50 - the line of games I think you need a
31:52 - lobby than a cube games yeah you'd be
31:54 - correct that I've put people into a
31:56 - lobby first and then IQ I just like
31:58 - right the plan of the car so you guys
32:00 - are aware the plan of this dream was not
32:02 - to write very much code at all like I
32:04 - was just planning on just releasing this
32:06 - and being like go play have fun
32:09 - I wasn't honestly expecting this many
32:12 - people to be playing so that's why maybe
32:16 - I can limit the amount of connections
32:18 - okay look I'm gonna try with the limit
32:21 - and it'll cue you like it'll if I do
32:24 - limit then it won't actually that'll
32:26 - just break you out okay let me try one
32:29 - let me try with the limit so if the
32:30 - connections I will only run like three
32:32 - games at once and see if I can get that
32:34 - working maybe let's see you know what
32:38 - let's just try this connections minus
32:41 - equals one really what's wrong with that
32:45 - that is except oh I forgot to comment
32:51 - out that and I don't need to go back in
32:53 - that nano watch a bit server
33:01 - okay let's try this yeah this is not
33:06 - going as smoothly as I was hoping
33:08 - okay someone's connected let's let's try
33:12 - this I'm really scared to keep running
33:13 - the server because then you guys just
33:15 - overload it like immediately I have it's
33:17 - a good server but I just I just my
33:18 - programming right there's nothing wrong
33:20 - with the server let's run a game it's
33:24 - gonna be I'm gonna be spectator mode
33:25 - right now aren't I
33:26 - oh there we go okay I'm playing against
33:29 - blue jays holy crap
33:38 - okay um so server's going down one more
33:44 - time
33:45 - I'm gonna fix it again I thought I
33:47 - remember that was the issue I ran into
33:48 - we're just gonna loop through the keys
33:50 - and just assign you into the next game
33:52 - if that doesn't work so say if G is less
33:57 - than all right if G not in games then
34:03 - we'll just add a new game so we'll say
34:05 - games say games and then zero was bored
34:17 - 8 comma 8 will do games G actually that
34:23 - should work should I be using a VPN no
34:27 - no you don't need a VPN I'm not stealing
34:28 - your IP don't worry um okay let's fix
34:31 - this No yeah whoever it's someone said
34:37 - in the chat cool idea brave project
34:40 - you're correct a very brave project I
34:42 - already had like I address already in
34:44 - use oh great that's gonna be an issue
34:46 - yeah you guys can see here like this is
34:49 - what the server is that's 8 as 8 cores
34:52 - tasks to 37 through 1 running ok let's
34:55 - let's close out any Python tasks I have
34:58 - right now I feel like the firewall on
35:04 - the server might be blocking all these
35:07 - connections back that's a very possible
35:11 - issue I'm just gonna monitor this server
35:13 - tab you guys go ahead and try to connect
35:15 - her
35:15 - we got one connection let's see what's
35:17 - going on
35:24 - alright guys try to connect I want to
35:27 - see if I can get this going or not we
35:30 - got one connection right now let me run
35:34 - one no I forgot I have two connection
35:40 - reset by peer Connect connect holy crap
35:52 - disconnect player none left game 0
35:55 - number connections to so works with 2
35:57 - games what happens when we have three
35:59 - games because right now there's two
36:00 - games running and I don't see any issues
36:02 - with three connections so it means
36:05 - someone's waiting to queue for game so
36:07 - if I try to go in now and now it's just
36:12 - work anymore oh wait okay your block
36:17 - their turn okay I'm playing against
36:19 - someone see if they can move like I
36:22 - don't seem to get kicked right away when
36:24 - I do this but a lot of people seem to
36:27 - just be like instantly being
36:28 - disconnected oh now I'm playing against
36:32 - someone else so what's actually
36:34 - happening here is other people are
36:38 - joining my game like when someone leaves
36:41 - this game someone else actually gets put
36:43 - into this game which is not obviously
36:45 - what you want what you want when someone
36:46 - leaves it it deletes that game um so you
36:49 - get kicked you can see this is this
36:51 - guy's turn he's not going so I'm just
36:52 - gonna quit and then play again um see if
36:57 - I can get in a game here I've had a few
37:01 - decent ones going waiting for player so
37:04 - that's me I'm the third connection see
37:06 - if someone else comes in here and see if
37:09 - this works
37:09 - um yeah trace my module named name era
37:16 - name Jake is not to find
37:26 - so someone else left
37:28 - ok guys someone joint okay now it's my
37:29 - turn all right sweet I'm playing against
37:31 - someone playing against bluejay this
37:33 - guy's can shout out to bluejay
37:34 - he has consistently been joining these
37:36 - games I've seen him in it like all the
37:38 - time do this ok so I'm playing I'm
37:41 - playing a civil game of chess right now
37:42 - and this seems to be working and this is
37:47 - against again one of the viewers right
37:48 - now blue jay and nothing's going on with
37:51 - our game like at least that I'm noticing
37:54 - there's nothing happening so we'll see
37:58 - here you have to put your name in
38:01 - quotations no you don't have to put your
38:02 - name the quotation your name should just
38:03 - be like text if you type numbers and
38:05 - stuff you might like run into an issue
38:06 - Oh connection so bluej either left that
38:13 - hmm connection reset by pierre blur none
38:17 - left game to get guys options right now
38:21 - we can keep I can keep trying I can set
38:23 - a limit on the amount of connections and
38:25 - see if that fixes things like just set
38:27 - it some max like 10 games running at
38:29 - once or something like that or I can try
38:32 - to program to fix it so infinite people
38:35 - can connect you guys can let me know
38:37 - what you want to see in the stream again
38:39 - I'm just doing this for fun I want to
38:40 - chat with some of you guys I'm not
38:41 - really too bothered that it's not
38:42 - working as well as I was hoping it would
38:44 - because I kind of expected that to be
38:46 - honest with you but um again you guys
38:49 - have to let me know what you want to see
38:51 - from that number of games oh ok let's
38:57 - get rid of this spectator thing the
39:01 - spectator of code is just not working if
39:03 - G not in games games G or what I think I
39:07 - should do is loop through all the games
39:10 - see if they're ready and if they're not
39:12 - ready then just put that player in the
39:15 - game so maybe that's what I'll do to
39:16 - determine the games so we don't get
39:18 - these weird connection issues so yeah ok
39:22 - so let's try that so let's say for game
39:25 - and games
39:27 - keys
39:31 - if game I guess oh it's gonna be keys
39:36 - will say if games game dot ready equals
39:42 - it goes false then we'll just throw
39:44 - someone in that game so I'll just say
39:45 - game say G equals game um
39:50 - with this new bytes object has no
39:53 - attribute ready oh that would have not
39:55 - unpick olden time holy crap okay I
40:00 - didn't miss any Super chats here tonight
40:02 - cuz someone gave me oh it's okay says I
40:04 - have eight dollars in revenue but it's
40:05 - because of its like us to get to
40:08 - Canadian conversion alright let me rerun
40:11 - the server guys again I apologize for
40:13 - all this mess I really wish this was
40:14 - working a bit better but you know we'll
40:16 - see server let's see if I can get this
40:18 - going now override okay so by the way in
40:24 - case you're confused this is win SCP or
40:27 - something which is just allowing me to
40:30 - FTP to the server so that I don't have
40:31 - to like do like I don't know edit the
40:34 - code on the server could you not compile
40:37 - this into an exe I could but I'd like
40:39 - then I'd have to you guys I'd have to
40:41 - keep working with stuff so just easier
40:42 - to do this okay let's try this now I'm
40:44 - game
40:45 - Tim connect all right waiting for player
40:51 - player B 1 in game 0 so I mean someone
40:54 - quits hey Tim left game 0 okay I'm
40:59 - waiting for someone enjoy my game right
41:00 - now there we go
41:02 - in so someone joined they got put in my
41:04 - game that's blue J sweet let's run it
41:08 - I've been playing against this guy like
41:10 - the whole time this is this is funny
41:13 - alright connection reset by peer I can't
41:19 - I don't know how to fix that issue so if
41:22 - the connection resets like how do you
41:26 - get a too much traffic to the socket
41:29 - holy
41:31 - I could set a time so there's too much
41:37 - traffic that's the issue I'm too much
41:39 - traffic on the server that's that's what
41:41 - we've figured out is the issue so it's
41:43 - working sometimes but then we just get
41:44 - randomly kicked because there's too much
41:46 - traffic all right so let's say socket
41:48 - Python too much traffic let's see if I
41:56 - can fix that you guys can keep messing
41:57 - with it what is the name cache when you
42:00 - set by peer it's fatal the remote server
42:02 - has sent you an rst packet which
42:04 - indicates an immediate dropping in the
42:05 - connection this means is disconnect
42:16 - connect yeah so connection reset by peer
42:18 - is the issue
42:27 - oh I can raise the socket time out issue
42:30 - okay let's try that and then that way
42:33 - okay socket time out raise Python let's
42:43 - see here that's all I want to raise that
42:48 - okay I want to raise the socket time out
42:50 - let's see this so you got eliminate yeah
42:52 - I have to limit like how this is low
42:54 - level networking socket how to catch
42:56 - socket time out set default timeout let
43:07 - me see what sockets default timeout is
43:08 - and then set it higher default timeout
43:13 - Python so what I've determined is
43:15 - happening I don't know if this is
43:16 - correct or not is um that it just
43:20 - there's so much traffic then it's not
43:22 - sending back in time and then it's just
43:25 - dropping the connection be the same well
43:26 - you cannot connecting I'm just gonna
43:27 - disconnect so I want to raise that
43:29 - socket timeout if so if I can do that
43:33 - then hopefully this will be work better
43:35 - timeout
43:37 - curses socket timeout okay so subclass
43:41 - socket time a note I don't know what the
43:44 - default socket timeout is I don't know
43:46 - what the thing is that it takes set
43:48 - timeout value set a time and I'm
43:53 - blocking socket operations the value may
43:55 - be non-native floating-point number
43:56 - expressed seconds okay so if that's
43:59 - seconds then let's just set that timeout
44:01 - to like five seconds and five seconds
44:05 - should be plenty of time for that at it
44:11 - socket default timeout five okay so
44:17 - let's run that now and see if I gets to
44:21 - work almost work install pie game for
44:24 - the impressive stuff man yeah then the
44:26 - script that I wrote to install pie game
44:28 - was um I was pretty impressed by that to
44:31 - be quite honest with you guys I'd show
44:32 - you one but like it just makes sure that
44:34 - if you have don't have pie game it
44:35 - automatically I'm oh god it's still not
44:38 - working very well if you're wondering
44:42 - what I'm doing I'm just pouring water
44:43 - into my mug um connect/disconnect Game
44:48 - one ended connections okay uh Pierre
45:00 - okay I don't think it's working guys
45:05 - let's see this server offline try again
45:15 - yeah yeah yeah that's yeah um kierra
45:22 - zero Pierre Pierre here connection reset
45:26 - Pierre so I need to handle that key err
45:29 - what line is that happening on 49 from
45:33 - threaded client
45:38 - oh hey Terry how you doing um okay so
45:42 - let's let's fix that Keir now so I'm
45:48 - getting this I mean this Kiera four
45:53 - games game which means a game clearly
45:56 - it's just not but that it should be a
45:57 - key cuz for game and game stock keys if
46:00 - games game got ready equals equals false
46:03 - G equals game past game that should just
46:06 - work that's not working we need to just
46:10 - try accept that done um
46:13 - bo games games try except when you don't
46:21 - know what to do just put in a try and
46:22 - accept just break that um alright let's
46:31 - try this print error game does not exist
46:42 - maybe we might have to do a like part
46:44 - two to the stream where Tim actually
46:46 - like fixes this and makes it work
46:48 - properly I thought the most common issue
46:50 - was just the timeout issue which I
46:52 - thought I could fix by just setting it
46:54 - bigger but also I'm wondering now where
46:57 - are most of you guys that are connecting
46:59 - let me know in the chat like are you
47:00 - guys in India are you in like Canada are
47:03 - you in Europe because that's probably
47:05 - gonna influence how this works with the
47:08 - timeout issue yeah that's probably gonna
47:12 - have some effect on the timeout again I
47:15 - don't know but let's break outside oh my
47:19 - god okay you fixed that break how do I
47:24 - do this is past
47:27 - okay so if that's the issue then bo
47:32 - games game let's just pick one that's do
47:38 - we use game any rails game if game not
47:41 - in games break so it should do that here
47:45 - Bo games game Bo to start user Bo games
47:49 - game so it'll just it's just crashes I
47:52 - okay try I don't know what's wrong with
47:58 - this I'm in Canada I'm in u.s. sorry wow
48:01 - I'm in I'm in Brazil you drink water
48:04 - from mug yes I do Ottawa sweet okay so
48:06 - we got people from all over USA
48:08 - Indonesia yeah I don't know I don't
48:13 - really know what the issue is to be
48:14 - honest I think it's also a thing like
48:16 - I'm sending a crazy amount of bytes like
48:19 - a lot of information like you can see
48:21 - this is how much it's sending every time
48:23 - so that could be an issue too maybe I'd
48:26 - like at some point you know I can have a
48:28 - look at this when I'm more focused not
48:30 - on stream and try to fix this um we'll
48:34 - keep going with it though okay so
48:36 - connections plus equal one con dot send
48:38 - out a string vo equals games game that
48:43 - doesn't work let's just pick another
48:45 - game so we already have the script to do
48:48 - that
48:48 - so if games game dot ready okay let's
48:55 - try this
49:01 - let's say bo equals games game check
49:08 - Instagram DM great proposition Tim
49:10 - alright let's check well I'll check
49:12 - through my stuff in a second guys okay
49:14 - let's try to run this again I know the
49:15 - server's offline right now so you guys
49:17 - won't be seeing anything
49:17 - I'm server yes but like this works for
49:23 - two-player I might just max the
49:25 - connections at two and play against some
49:27 - of you guys and like if this doesn't
49:28 - work if you guys are interested in doing
49:30 - that let me know or maybe make it like
49:32 - two games running at once and then
49:34 - hopefully that can like make things a
49:35 - bit better cuz again I don't really know
49:38 - what's going wrong with this Tim yeah
49:41 - it's hilarious the second that I start
49:43 - it like a ton of people join in so I
49:45 - know you guys are just like waiting to
49:46 - queue in the game when was this I hear
49:49 - new connections who's keeps naming
49:52 - themself hi Tim okay I'm playing now
49:55 - against someone see how long this can
49:58 - see how long this works I'm playing
50:01 - against blue Jeff why I always play
50:03 - against blue J I think it just me Blue
50:06 - Jay left game hey Tim left game
50:10 - connection reset by Pierre I still I
50:14 - don't get I'm from Greece I still cannot
50:16 - connect oh so I tried ping server's IP
50:17 - and has a hundred milliseconds latency
50:19 - is not too long maybe some thing other
50:21 - is the problem
50:23 - Poland dude yeah you're
50:27 - Bo reference before assignment that's an
50:32 - issue game does not exist okay let's try
50:35 - this again try accept print err game
50:43 - does not exist okay let's not do that
50:46 - just go and so pass well vo equals games
50:50 - games Bo is here though so this should
50:52 - be fun um you know reference before
50:57 - assignment where's that issue be able to
51:01 - start user current ID line sixty-three
51:03 - that shouldn't be an issue should have
51:06 - Bo should be defined Oh if so otherwise
51:10 - so you say if you notice it Bo equals
51:14 - none if not Bo then create a new game
51:21 - some will say I need to global current
51:26 - game I will just do it by connections I
51:28 - guess we'll just create a new game set
51:31 - games connection over to hmm okay I'm
51:40 - gonna leave this running you guys can
51:41 - still try messing with it I think I'm
51:43 - just gonna focus dial in here and try to
51:45 - fix this with this it just it has to be
51:48 - something with just the game queuing and
51:49 - just something like that unless people
51:51 - are quitting from like the client side
51:53 - but I don't think there's something
51:54 - wrong with the client side and if there
51:55 - was then it should be spitting out the
51:57 - error to you guys when the game crashes
51:59 - so if you see those errors let me know
52:00 - but um let's just try to get this
52:02 - working if try bo games game so I want
52:07 - to have a unique ID for each game but
52:10 - I'm doing it based on connections but I
52:12 - can't do it based on connections because
52:14 - if I do it based on connections then it
52:17 - just like that doesn't work okay so
52:21 - deleting games try Dell games games
52:27 - connections - it was one game game ended
52:30 - disconnected player
52:33 - okay that should work get rid of this
52:37 - say Pio eCos games games
52:39 - I got a 56 number a few times and
52:48 - running it oh my I don't even know
52:49 - what's up at that I'll run the game side
52:51 - and see what's up about to you it's
52:54 - funny because this works so well like
52:56 - I've run I'd had like four games running
52:58 - um like on my computer and like my
53:00 - brother's computer and they was working
53:01 - fine but now it's just not working at
53:04 - all
53:04 - let's just do this let's not go based on
53:08 - connections what I think I'm gonna do is
53:11 - just loop through all the games that
53:12 - exist see if first of all those get
53:16 - whole hmm I could just set rather than
53:22 - creating all these new games I could
53:24 - just set like five games have people
53:27 - join I don't know if want to do that
53:29 - either so many different ways to
53:30 - possibly do this if connections modules
53:32 - to equals equals zero games connections
53:35 - over to or eight I don't think I'm even
53:40 - I think I'm just gonna loop through and
53:41 - see if there's any games that aren't
53:43 - ready yet
53:43 - ABB's someone into that game and if
53:46 - there's no games then just create a new
53:48 - one okay so for game and game dog keys
53:52 - if game game to already equals false G
53:54 - equals game okay perfect
53:56 - will say if I will just say G equals
53:58 - negative one here if G equals negative
54:03 - one then we'll say games zero equals and
54:09 - in this case games not ready
54:14 - game zero but how are we ever gonna have
54:17 - game one then G equals equals negative
54:20 - one games and then lists games dot keys
54:31 - plus one game Ducky's negative one plus
54:36 - one equals board eighty I also ran out
54:42 - of input ran on input by subjects not
54:44 - you ready server offline what does that
54:46 - mean
54:47 - it's what I've got in CMD David that
54:50 - means that like you received a bytes
54:52 - object it did an unpick 'el and then the
54:55 - server offline so just like something
54:56 - happened with the server there I know
54:58 - the issue but it's kind of hard to like
54:59 - explain how that works we're getting
55:01 - this this issue with bo2 saying local
55:05 - variable Bo reference for assignment
55:07 - which means that the try/except up here
55:10 - wasn't working properly so Bo goos games
55:12 - if not spec okay Pio goes games game
55:18 - that should just always work if that
55:22 - doesn't then we should just quit the
55:23 - threaded client um pickled Dada was
55:25 - truncated pickled Dada was truncated you
55:31 - shouldn't be getting pickled data
55:33 - truncated I really tried so hard to fix
55:35 - that issue okay let's try this again
55:39 - okay let's send more data I don't think
55:42 - it's a timeout anymore I used to think
55:43 - it was the timeout let's receive this
55:45 - times eight so we don't get truncated
55:48 - pickled Dada anymore and let's see if
55:53 - the server runs a bit better now if we
55:55 - get multiple games going so say for game
55:57 - and game about keys there's nothing I
55:58 - won't do anything obviously so if G
56:00 - equals negative one games list games dog
56:05 - keys negative 1 which is the n plus one
56:09 - he was bored eight eight and then just
56:12 - say me equals madness
56:17 - so gee who's that and then G hates
56:24 - anyone who's new if you guys want to try
56:25 - this out I'm just having some issues
56:27 - getting a server running properly
56:29 - probably go for like another hour
56:30 - something we'll see you know how this
56:34 - works number of connections number of
56:38 - games equals the land of games that
56:40 - should be correct actually should delete
56:42 - game when you leave I almost want to max
56:46 - it to for connections and just say don't
56:48 - accept the connect in case so I'm gonna
56:50 - max the four connections or now I'm
56:51 - gonna say if connections is less than
56:54 - four otherwise break and we'll see it
56:59 - like I'll slowly increment what do you
57:03 - do it I'll slowly increment the amount
57:06 - of games that we have and then you know
57:10 - we'll see how this goes so we'll start
57:13 - with four and then we'll go up from
57:16 - there okay so let me go server yes okay
57:24 - let's run this now invalid syntax yep
57:30 - really okay yeah no server doc hi
57:35 - actually I don't want to edit it like
57:36 - that spend it here server it up high so
57:43 - equal isn't equal equals such a silly
57:48 - mistake that's fine I better fix that in
57:51 - here too so I forget if G equals equals
57:53 - negative one run that no run that okay
57:59 - connections first for people get in the
58:01 - game go list index out of range
58:11 - new fix one second this is actually easy
58:14 - fix
58:15 - I can't believe I didn't think of that
58:16 - um try because there's obviously gonna
58:22 - be no games so you have to create a new
58:24 - one
58:25 - except game 0 equals board so say G is
58:29 - zero games equals board okay try that
58:34 - now this is so stressful because usually
58:38 - I can just test it on my own computer
58:39 - and then like if it doesn't work it's
58:41 - just an issue for me but you guys are
58:42 - all like trying to connect constantly so
58:44 - we like I can get as frustrating for you
58:45 - guys especially because you're just
58:46 - trying to help me out
58:47 - ah all right I gotta be fast yeah
58:50 - otherwise I'm not even gonna get in the
58:51 - game get game Tim
58:56 - server offline if address already in use
59:00 - that that's an issue H top
59:04 - whoever's told me to do it concurrently
59:05 - um that's it that's a problem for
59:09 - another day
59:15 - what is this network manager thing doing
59:18 - I don't know what that's doing I don't
59:22 - think I have any more Python processes
59:24 - running should be at the top if they are
59:27 - oh people just like instantly connect
59:34 - server offline oh I'm not even gonna get
59:37 - in connection reset by Pierre let's see
59:40 - this Tim your block their turn okay
59:48 - what happened here it just stopped
59:51 - running oh my god I'm an idiot so what I
59:59 - did
59:59 - oh no this is that yeah don't do that
60:06 - yeah that's just yeah I essentially made
60:10 - it so once a hits for connection service
60:11 - stops running I don't you don't want
60:14 - that uh me Gayle fishing was ok it was
60:17 - kind of cold but you know it was alright
60:19 - connection reset can actually set it can
60:21 - actually reset connection number of
60:22 - connections three number of connections
60:24 - I want to reach for connections and then
60:26 - that way we can just like chill Johnny
60:28 - left game one come on Johnny
60:30 - Tim your block there turn all right for
60:35 - connections if no one leaves then you
60:37 - should be okay we should see if this
60:39 - works
60:40 - FIFA lover I'm doing good man how are
60:42 - you doing alright
60:44 - come on man let's go Zinberg it's your
60:46 - turn if you don't go see what I'm gonna
60:48 - have to quit okay there we go
60:50 - alright I'm gonna play a casual game of
60:53 - chess if you guys have any questions you
60:54 - just want to chat ask me anything feel
60:56 - free in the chat if you have any tips
60:59 - what I like if this works with four
61:01 - games then we've kind of fixed some of
61:05 - the stuff oh he's going Queen out
61:06 - alright
61:13 - I'm waiting to see if it tells me that I
61:15 - left 'game okay so let's go like hmm I
61:21 - also like very bad at chess so this is
61:23 - gonna be an interesting game I want to
61:24 - protect that pawn you guys have any

61:54 - everything else is having I'm gonna get
61:56 - my music going quickly here you're still
62:01 - watching yes I am knew he's gonna take
62:06 - that this guy's killing me right now
62:12 - this is your old chess game this is my
62:14 - old chess game this is my old chess game
62:16 - faithful lover I wasn't connected when
62:19 - it said I disconnected Oh God this is
62:22 - just okay this game is working though
62:24 - like I'm playing a nice game of chess
62:25 - against this guy although he's
62:32 - absolutely like mopping the floor with
62:34 - me but I mean other than that
62:37 - nice civil game
62:44 - also guys I'm working on this really
62:47 - cool machine learning model it's uh it's
62:50 - a chat bot that talks like me I've got
62:54 - it like kind of working like there's so
62:56 - much more I need to do with it but like
62:57 - it's really it's pretty exciting so if
62:58 - you guys are excited about that let me
63:00 - know I'm planning like what I'm doing is
63:02 - I trained it off all my previous
63:03 - iMessage history and I got all my
63:06 - responses like any given text and I
63:09 - forgot that you can go diagonal oh my
63:12 - god this guy's killing me um I Jesus
63:17 - can't go there do this sorry I got
63:19 - distracted off train it off all my
63:21 - iMessage history and then um what did I
63:26 - do from there sure we got the like
63:28 - responses based on what I've said oh my
63:31 - god this guy's killing I can't focus
63:32 - when I'm getting destroyed in chests now
63:35 - he's gonna take my rook isn't he
63:38 - let's see and right now I'm just working
63:42 - on the model that essentially can like
63:43 - take any string of text and give you a
63:47 - response that sounds like me but it's
63:48 - pretty interesting it's actually like I
63:50 - don't know he's kind of blowing my mind
63:51 - how it actually works
63:53 - I've been following like a few tutorials
63:54 - online on how to figure it out this this
63:59 - video will be saved so you guys can look
64:01 - at it it's kind of just been a mess I've
64:03 - just been trying to figure stuff out and
64:04 - get people connected a few people I
64:06 - think we're playing games but I don't
64:08 - really know I don't know if someone else
64:11 - is playing a game currently I don't know
64:14 - if that's happening all I know is I'm
64:16 - getting killed in this game of chess and
64:17 - it just not is not going great I really
64:19 - wanted to try castling but then he kind
64:21 - of ruined my approach on that alright we
64:26 - got a piece there now he's gonna take it
64:28 - with the rook looks like that one black
64:31 - mirror episode yeah it works okay so his
64:34 - in bars playing against me yeah so I
64:36 - don't know you guys were all saying it
64:37 - wasn't working but as soon as I start
64:39 - playing it works for me and it's nothing
64:40 - to do with my network so I don't know
64:43 - hmm
64:45 - it's coming in a bit of a pickle right
64:48 - here
64:50 - is not really much way to catch up
64:53 - could you guys would think I'd be good
64:59 - at chess but I'm really it's just I'm
65:00 - really just not I'm definitely gonna
65:02 - play around with the server stuff I've
65:04 - seen it done foreign python so thanks
65:05 - man no worries got ya the end of the day
65:07 - you know if it doesn't work you can just
65:09 - steal the code I have on github it's
65:10 - completely open-source right and try to
65:13 - mess with it there what is he going for
65:15 - here
65:16 - Oh
65:19 - Zen bar left the game I don't know if he
65:22 - left or or not if we ran into an issue
65:24 - so yeah that's a question okay guys try
65:29 - to connect see if you can get your games
65:31 - running I'm gonna bump the games up to
65:33 - like six I think so that more people can
65:35 - connect so I'm gonna quit that now and
65:38 - then yeah let's just we'll keep bumping
65:41 - up and see if we get this working
65:42 - properly six I feel like I should be
65:46 - printing out like what game it's putting
65:47 - you in what game it's not putting in but
65:50 - again we don't really not that advanced
65:52 - here um okay so let's go server yes how
65:59 - old do you Tim I'm 18 guys I do really
66:02 - apologize to a lot of you guys I
66:03 - appreciate the help and everyone's
66:05 - joining in and trying to mess with this
66:06 - I think it's kind of fun but I mean like
66:08 - it's also kind of annoying because you
66:09 - want it I want to get working a little
66:11 - bit better but at the end of the day um
66:14 - I'm not left the game oh great so you
66:20 - had block it's their turn I'm playing
66:21 - against player - I don't know whoever
66:23 - that is he must not know type 2 naman
66:26 - Oh connection reset player non left the
66:33 - game player hey Tim left the game left
66:36 - the game left the game hmm I'm gonna try
66:41 - castle because I haven't done that yet
66:43 - that'll be our test currently
66:54 - add a listener for an input let's see oh
67:02 - great
67:03 - he knows I'm trying to Castle cuz he's
67:05 - listening to what I'm saying maybe that
67:08 - other way
67:09 - I remember reading somewhere like the
67:14 - rules of chess like in your opening you
67:16 - never want to move the same piece twice
67:17 - or something like that and I've just
67:19 - violated that rule a bunch of times man
67:20 - really you're not gonna let me Castle I
67:22 - just want to test my castling let's do
67:25 - that
67:26 - so now I'm kind of screwed because he
67:28 - has all these pieces advanced up the
67:30 - board but you know I don't this would be
67:34 - good if I was actually like a decent
67:35 - chess player other player left so again
67:37 - I don't oh there's something I got an
67:40 - error that popped up there let's read
67:42 - that err I mean I'm gonna run this with
67:45 - IDL II and try to play and see like what
67:47 - errors I get one if I disconnect an
67:51 - invalid argument was supplied oh I'm not
67:54 - running server sir why am i running
67:55 - server one run game
67:58 - no edit with ideally five Tim let's get
68:08 - this PI game window open all right
68:11 - waiting for player let's see the next
68:13 - person to successfully connect to the
68:15 - server is going to be yeah was early
68:21 - planning on making this stream like go
68:23 - for a long time if I was I would I trot
68:27 - like attempt to fix all these issues
68:28 - obviously but again I just don't really
68:30 - know like what is going on there's
68:31 - issues on the server side there's issues
68:33 - on the client side just a lot of stuff
68:35 - and apparently okay now I'm in so I'm
68:37 - playing at Blue Jay then playing against
68:38 - this guy like the whole time I just want
68:40 - to have this ideally window open so I
68:42 - can actually see what the air is when
68:44 - when I get one so I'm just gonna keep
68:46 - testing this will keep going just kind
68:48 - of play with it um what else you guys
68:52 - saying here all right
68:57 - I'm so bad at chess I don't know have
68:59 - any idea what made us to actually make
69:04 - if you guys haven't seen my other
69:06 - livestream by the way I did what was it
69:09 - like a 12 hour coding one where actually
69:11 - went for 12 hours this time and I did
69:13 - the tower defense game so that one's
69:15 - cool okay so ran outta input bytes
69:19 - objects has so much we already failed
69:21 - server offline ran Oh to input that is
69:24 - actually a easier fix okay so we can fix
69:27 - that one ran out of input so if you guys
69:29 - we're getting ran out of input as like a
69:31 - main issue I can fix that
69:35 - actually what is ran out of input err
69:43 - Python what is that getting this I would
69:50 - check the file is not empty first most
69:55 - of the answers here I've dealt with how
69:56 - to manage EOF error exceptions which is
69:59 - really handy if you're unsure but
70:00 - whether the pickled object is empty or
70:01 - not however if you're surprised pickle
70:03 - if I was empty okay so the pickle file
70:10 - is empty that it's sending to me which
70:13 - means it wouldn't have been dumped from
70:15 - the server properly or it just like
70:18 - didn't receive anything from the server
70:20 - so it was empty when I was opening it
70:22 - okay let's try to mess with that server
70:27 - okay connection closed they'll print
70:34 - e.honda
70:35 - send all send data it goes pickled dumb
70:41 - Bo okay is that always happening if not
70:46 - d break so it should just be dumping
70:51 - this this pic object every time but I
70:54 - guess if Bo isn't defined but it should
70:57 - be
71:00 - so I don't know why that would be it so
71:02 - in the client error here pickled out
71:06 - loads reply let's try to make this eight
71:14 - yeah I don't know why that's doing that
71:16 - I don't know why I'm getting that except
71:23 - socket air as II trying to apply pickles
71:28 - ran out of input hmm where was I looking
71:32 - at up okay let's see
71:49 - pickle ran on input easy solutions to
71:54 - prefix each message with the length the
71:56 - problem with your code is that receive
71:57 - when you cease to be saga my return
71:59 - different amounts of data from what you
72:00 - might have expect and their slice type
72:02 - packet boundaries so the easy solution
72:03 - is prefect each message then for
72:06 - receiving okay
72:14 - for receiving everything the server
72:16 - sends until it closes its side of the
72:18 - connection try this socket dot send all
72:22 - okay and then start server at address so
72:36 - yeah I don't know why I'm getting that
72:38 - issue you guys were saying you were
72:39 - getting that issue a lot - um yeah I
72:42 - don't know that's it I wonder earn you
72:44 - guys playing right now says something
72:46 - says some games ago I player Jake left
72:48 - game one game one ended I think the game
72:50 - aspect is working but I think what just
72:52 - happening is it's it's just crashing on
72:54 - on this the client-side so I think I've
72:56 - honestly figured out because I don't get
72:58 - these like these happen to once in a
72:59 - while but that's not I don't know that's
73:01 - expected so I think what I need to do
73:03 - now is just mess with the client-side
73:04 - and see if there's a way that it you
73:06 - know it could keep trying rather than
73:09 - just doing this this issue here so we'll
73:13 - send that same data we'll just say like
73:15 - wow should we try it like I just want to
73:19 - set a timer essentially okay so let's
73:23 - import time this is gonna require that
73:25 - you guys read download this after so
73:28 - I'll tell you that after that's probably
73:29 - an issue to you guys are using like
73:31 - different versions of everything okay
73:32 - anyways we'll print E and I will say try
73:37 - or say start time this time that time
73:47 - we'll say Wow time that time - start
73:55 - others where time is less than and we'll
73:58 - do well give it like a 10-second doing
74:02 - this a long time we'll give it a five
74:03 - second time out so it waits five seconds
74:05 - to try to get another response if it
74:06 - doesn't get one in that time it will
74:07 - just break um so then what we'll do is
74:10 - just keep trying to do this so we'll
74:12 - keep if pick okay let's try this
74:15 - keep trying this so I could just do like
74:26 - a Wow let's put the whole thing in a
74:29 - while with whatever I'm trying to do
74:30 - here let's just put it in a while loop
74:31 - with it this time then start time while
74:42 - true and we'll say if reply okay so if
74:49 - we get here then we just break this
74:50 - wallet if we get to the point where we
74:53 - can return reply then break say well
74:58 - I'll just return anyway so we don't even
74:59 - need to break it'll just keep trying it
75:01 - but we need to do that time aspect let's
75:04 - do the hot so say time time - start
75:09 - underscore time okay I don't know if
75:13 - there's any way that I can block people
75:15 - from joining because I want to just try
75:17 - it on my end and see if this works okay
75:18 - I'm gonna stop that connection
75:20 - um Python equals Java they are both to
75:25 - me the same know Python Java are very
75:27 - different
75:27 - okay I first update a few things I think
75:30 - I'm just gonna just throw this code
75:33 - other player left
75:35 - so what's that exception where it says
75:37 - like failed Oh failed just means it it
75:41 - broke that while loop skipper to that
75:48 - try accept and screen break print
75:52 - exception where else is this break
75:55 - sometimes printer please type your name
76:10 - no I can't do that okay so I'm gonna
76:14 - upload this code to github you guys
76:16 - gonna have to read download it I'm gonna
76:19 - change the server here to what it is on
76:22 - my computer now I got to deal with all
76:25 - these different versions just a master
76:26 - cap you read that go to github let's go
76:34 - code update files so once I changed
76:39 - water client and game server as well
77:06 - okay everyone go to the github
77:09 - redownload this code I just updated some
77:12 - stuff I don't like
77:13 - who knows is it gonna work I have no
77:15 - idea we'll see and try that okay we're
77:18 - gonna we're gonna mess with that now and
77:20 - see if we can get that going
77:22 - I just put in the chat too because that
77:23 - was gonna happen sooner I'm waiting for
77:25 - all these connections now to come in so
77:27 - this is let's see this if you try to
77:28 - connect with the other one it still
77:29 - might work but again okay I'm gonna have
77:36 - to update the code on github again I'm
77:37 - I've apologized I should tested this
77:39 - first Tim sir offline
77:45 - what's the issue started connection new
77:50 - connection what's you get says you guys
77:54 - are in though Tim but I can't join
77:59 - server offline why is that happening
78:06 - games you ended number connections one
78:08 - actually reset or any this it's not
78:10 - working is it guys I don't know what the
78:12 - hell what the heck is happening there's
78:14 - nothing I don't think anything is
78:15 - happening on server I think it's just
78:16 - literally not oh the reply might be oh
78:26 - yeah I know what I did wrong
78:32 - oh god okay let's go to network client
78:34 - up I just everyone's like it's broken
78:38 - its broken okay let's see um well time
78:44 - that time is less than five I apologize
78:59 - go redownload again guys I changed it
79:02 - that's yeah that's yeah oh my god okay
79:07 - i'ma modify that when I mind now ideally
79:11 - I dis just yeah that would be why I
79:13 - wasn't working I was like why the heck
79:15 - is this going now it should work uh
79:17 - what's running the wrong thing you're
79:20 - gonna have to go download again guys
79:22 - from the thing I apologize see this
79:27 - still not working oh my god I don't know
79:30 - what the issue is edit with ideally
79:40 - server offline okay let's try this yeah
79:48 - I pulled just for all the mistakes yeah
79:49 - I don't know this is kind of fun to mess
79:50 - around with it but like this is breaking
79:54 - when it shouldn't be actually sleeping
79:57 - and break okay if Ronnie befall Bo
80:04 - equals connect so it's gotta be
80:06 - something here that's messing up print
80:15 - okay I'm just gonna turn the server
80:17 - offline so I don't mess with you guys
80:18 - anymore
80:19 - let's see what this issue is
80:29 - server oh well now the servers actually
80:31 - offline so that's gonna be the issue
80:36 - okay let's try this one more time
80:45 - try this Tim server offline so it's just
80:54 - printing oh I'm not ready Tim let's go
81:04 - this float object is not callable what
81:10 - did I do here subline um float object is
81:18 - not callable that's gonna be in here
81:20 - somewhere that I did this mess son float
81:28 - object is not call well I don't even
81:30 - know where that is time time okay okay
81:46 - where is my github yeah I think I'm
81:48 - gonna go for like another 40 minutes
81:49 - we'll see like we'll get ups like two
81:51 - hours because I am determined to try to
81:54 - fix this and then we'll see
82:11 - alright redownload again guys I'm typing
82:14 - it in the chat because I know it's
82:15 - something you won't see it I'm having
82:16 - silly syntax errors I should test this
82:18 - before I upload it to github I know I'm
82:19 - an idiot but it's fun let's run this now
82:22 - and what this one's probably gonna work
82:25 - either
82:26 - I'm just like going out at each time
82:27 - let's see oh there we go
82:29 - we're in ok so I fix something again I
82:35 - have no idea if this is gonna do
82:36 - anything we have no but you guys you
82:38 - need you need to redownload otherwise
82:39 - it's just gonna kick you every time you
82:40 - try to go in you just hop you got to
82:42 - redownload it otherwise it's not gonna
82:44 - work where's my pie game window my pie
82:52 - game thing shut down I don't know what
82:56 - happened to it run this again main game
83:03 - Tim so I got in ok you're a block so
83:09 - someone's on right now I guess we'll see
83:11 - if someone moves
83:13 - how does Tim type and talk yeah it's an
83:16 - interesting question what is that issue
83:23 - getting some some air here I don't know
83:26 - what it is though I gotta wait for
83:30 - someone else to build successfully
83:31 - connect slow mode maybe no I don't need
83:33 - snow mode it's fine my turn
83:46 - okay so far so good
83:49 - Oh bites at your object has no actually
83:53 - ran out of input ran on input by jumping
83:56 - to actually time one okay so that means
84:04 - it didn't unpick lit um okay sub line
84:09 - bytes object has no attribute time one
84:13 - which would probably be mean that I
84:16 - didn't unpick alit so reply equals
84:18 - pickled loads and I'm returning reply
84:22 - which would just be this because
84:24 - something didn't happen there oh I can't
84:30 - return reply unless we make it over this
84:35 - loop so only if we get to here are we
84:44 - good
84:44 - so because that should be the end of the
84:47 - wallet I only want to break if this
84:49 - works properly break I got Rando to
84:54 - input thing I'm running on a bun - yeah
84:56 - no okay that's let's fix this uh I just
85:01 - got to modify this client file inside
85:04 - live stream thank you guys again for the
85:07 - feedback does really help a lot and
85:09 - let's go can't change that and
85:17 - commit changes what is it case someone
85:21 - was complaining why is this on this
85:22 - playlist it's gonna one I haven't heard
85:25 - yet rockabyebaby comes on in the
85:32 - playlist I know great selling right ok
85:33 - let's run that ivory up I've updated it
85:45 - just like it yes you gonna have to keep
85:47 - downloading it is B if you have the git
85:49 - command you could just keep pulling it
85:50 - it'll be easy but Tim waited for player
85:56 - alright my turn an established
86:06 - connection was aborted by the software
86:07 - in your host machine by itself guys know
86:11 - what ready established connection was
86:22 - how do you know not minecraft is your
86:35 - host machine but not minecraft
86:36 - Python I've just finished watching the
86:40 - tower defense fit how do you like it man
86:41 - using some Frank no I'm using no
86:43 - framework i coded this from scratch
86:45 - which is probably why it's not working
86:46 - and established and remover suffer
86:48 - heroes machine let's see what the issue
86:51 - is here timeout or the never network
86:52 - connection died firewall see do we think
87:00 - it could be a firewall issue
87:02 - timeout to other network network
87:03 - connection dot firewall close the
87:04 - connection because it was open too long
87:06 - connection was closed before process has
87:09 - been finished
87:17 - there's not really a framework it just
87:19 - like I don't know solution disable
87:33 - antivirus disable firewall okay so which
87:37 - it could be an issue with that but I
87:39 - never had any issue before with that hmm
87:52 - let's see
88:02 - so that was the issue that was like run
88:05 - into object has not recovered
88:06 - all right well that's a new issue just
88:08 - there's just a lot you know the funny
88:10 - thing is like this works for like two
88:12 - people I just don't even work for a law
88:16 - so I assume it's just an issue with like
88:17 - it can't handle all these people and I
88:19 - just haven't coated in a way to handle
88:21 - these people socket air and establish
88:22 - connection
88:23 - I should really maybe open like a new
88:25 - socket after a certain amount of people
88:27 - connect why do I keep getting air output
88:33 - this pipe air occurs server responds to
88:36 - requests and the client has already
88:37 - closed the connection browsers do that
88:40 - sometimes finite usage you can ignore
88:42 - this web okay so that means like I want
88:45 - to make sure this client the client
88:48 - doesn't close the connection on himself
88:49 - so where is do I would even close this
88:53 - I'm gonna disconnect here anywhere well
88:57 - time time current II reply equals pickle
89:02 - uploads
89:07 - hmm people that load should load that
89:13 - into an object no I don't need to like
89:15 - cast it or something hmm
89:23 - Piccolo's ply said bytes object has no
89:29 - attribute which means it didn't get
89:31 - loaded in which means when I returned
89:33 - reply would have returned that not that
89:38 - okay
89:43 - who
89:47 - it should really just keep calling until
89:49 - it returns all right we'll do a time out
89:55 - we'll do a longer time out maybe less
90:01 - than ten I don't want to just keep like
90:03 - spamming the error message though
90:07 - invalid load key eight pickle data was
90:10 - truncated I don't know what the heck
90:13 - that error is some guy keeps keeps
90:17 - naming himself hi Tim Tim you really
90:19 - should save your name I should have done
90:21 - that all right let's try this
90:29 - we need to watch that console output oh
90:34 - oh okay I moved it was just lagging I
90:40 - guess so connection was reset means that
90:45 - some like from the client-side it reset
90:48 - the connection which I have no idea how
90:50 - to fix that this game seems to be
90:53 - working smoothly
90:54 - raisa say that's probably in a crash but
90:56 - we'll see see established connection was
91:08 - aborted by the software in your host
91:09 - machine
91:15 - yeah that's established can I don't know
91:22 - to fix that that's the issue
91:32 - Python sockets okay I'm gonna keep going
91:36 - out this for a little bit cuz I can fix
91:37 - that and I might be able to get against
91:38 - you guys
91:38 - but I don't know what we've seen the ER
91:40 - flask okay when running tests to install
91:44 - an established connection I could bump
91:57 - that connection timeout but it shouldn't
91:59 - be a connection issue on hmm you try to
92:06 - reconnect now cuz then it has to start
92:08 - nuke this is a very complicated issue
92:10 - take your time you don't need to be
92:12 - stressed or anything I'm not stressed I
92:13 - just want a little bit stressed but I
92:15 - won't figure this out and it's just
92:17 - frustrating because I had it working so
92:19 - well for two games and then as soon as I
92:21 - went to maybe server blocks the
92:24 - real-time sockets because a lot of
92:25 - requests at the same time I'm gonna send
92:27 - an email to the guys that on my server
92:32 - I'm just gonna post on my other tab and
92:34 - just see if I can get them to respond
92:36 - because maybe there's a firewall on
92:38 - there that's blocking that so let's see
92:40 - if that's the issue so I gotta go to
92:43 - again big shout it to cherry servers
92:45 - they hooked me up with this server it's
92:48 - not definitely not their fault that's
92:49 - not working it's probably mine um like
92:54 - two cherry servers
93:06 - are you guys still trying to connect let
93:09 - me know if you guys are working or not I
93:10 - like you guys get in a game I think in
93:12 - that it just crashes like there's a
93:13 - timeout or something on the server but
93:16 - it does work like the game works
93:18 - everything that's functional it's just
93:20 - that it's just the server issue right so
93:23 - put that down oh man you guys got kicked
93:33 - again I'm mister I'm just on my other
93:39 - monitor right now guys just working
93:40 - developing a game is very hard it can be
93:42 - fixed at once and it can't be fixed at
93:45 - once oh yeah for sure I know you mean
93:46 - that I do think that firewall might be
93:49 - issue let's see here I'm just logging
94:01 - into the cherry server here and getting
94:05 - these guys see if they can help me out I
94:09 - don't know if there's a way to like
94:11 - disable the firewall on my server we'll
94:14 - see though let me we'll get it the hosts
94:21 - load on it too and see if it's like
94:22 - going crazy yeah says it can handle 3
94:33 - gigabits per second bandwidth or that's
94:34 - what it has your bandwidth so this
94:36 - should be fine networking
95:48 - hmm so I'm talking to Zack right now
95:52 - Adam cherry servers and we'll see if he
95:57 - gets back to me we can see what's
95:58 - happening here player as our left game
96:00 - but I didn't connect really what how
96:12 - does it have why would that be happening
96:14 - okay no it's because the thread that
96:17 - didn't end when you guys leave sometimes
96:18 - the thread actually doesn't end oh that
96:20 - can be an issue you I'm hey Tim by the
96:22 - way oh
96:25 - so some hey Tim there should not be any
96:27 - firewall and server by default
96:31 - just running some here let me put this
96:35 - on my other tab here okay so apparently
97:05 - is no firewall in the server so that's
97:07 - not the issue and you guys are saying
97:09 - that you're seeing your names in the
97:11 - console which is how do I see okay let's
97:16 - try this which is like kind of blowing
97:18 - my mind too
97:21 - so that means that the threads aren't
97:23 - stopping so we gotta fix that so thread
97:26 - try break print exception has eat break
97:32 - because I would kick you so we'll just
97:34 - break okay so let's try that now on the
97:38 - server side
97:41 - you know and that wind SB
97:53 - I'm hatin Oh the king of mystery will it
97:56 - make sense because your name is the king
97:58 - of mystery all right let's try this
98:02 - again and go No everyone go try to
98:09 - connect so now I'm starting to think
98:11 - maybe it's an issue I'm like that who
98:13 - knows at this point someone connected
98:15 - let's go to desktop chess game game I
98:22 - will play against you all right there
98:25 - turn hey Tim's time fifteen Tim's time
98:29 - all right
98:30 - see this works ah we left
98:42 - establish connection was aborted by the
98:45 - software in your host machine like I
98:49 - don't know what the heck that means
98:51 - maybe I need to disable firewall if I
98:54 - disable firewall and this works it's
99:00 - probably a bad idea to do this but let's
99:02 - see the main firewall off let's try it
99:07 - out I don't leave that off for long but
99:09 - let's see if this works now
99:18 - hey Tim is back in once again oh alright
99:28 - let's see no issues yet I don't know why
99:41 - I did that I'm just literally randomly
99:43 - moving pieces because I already know
99:44 - that it's just gonna break at some point
99:47 - let's go
99:53 - Nathan you missed quite a bit my friend
99:59 - game one ended connection reset by Peter
100:02 - okay
100:02 - oh dude to Castle that's not how you do
100:04 - it if you wanted to Castle you got to do
100:06 - castle and then hit King but I can't do
100:08 - it because you moved the dude oh so it
100:15 - wasn't the firewall that was the issue
100:16 - let's turn that back on yeah so that's
100:23 - just not the issue
100:26 - okay so go to client no might have to do
100:32 - another part time where I try to do this
100:33 - I really wanted to get a bunch of people
100:35 - going on he was working at first like
100:36 - kinda but then not really strange
100:40 - everyone is called player none yeah I
100:41 - don't know why this called player none I
100:43 - don't know why it's Nathan if you guys
100:45 - see your names and you not connecting
100:46 - then like let me know but who knows
100:51 - so yeah I think threaded clients friends
100:56 - exception II connection reset by peers
101:00 - so it's happening on the client side
101:01 - that it's just disconnecting oh I should
101:04 - probably change the socket timeout on
101:06 - the client side too cuz I down the
101:09 - server side to be oh wait did I don't
101:13 - have that I swear I added like
101:17 - Oh cuz I just brought it back to my
101:19 - other server alright let's see here um
101:24 - okay change socket default time outs
101:30 - this is like the last wind if this
101:33 - doesn't work then we I don't want to
101:35 - give up but we might have to socket dot
101:37 - set default timeout so I'm gonna try
101:41 - this on mine set as a ten-second timeout
101:45 - and then we'll try it on this as well so
101:48 - socket dot set default timeout that's
101:50 - ten seconds I know that sounds long but
101:52 - in chess it's like slow glee anyways so
101:54 - that's probably not that important I
101:55 - would you want to try another Network
101:57 - game like this okay so I got a push I
102:02 - got I'm gonna have to reset this chess
102:05 - game server yes waiting for connections
102:14 - okay
102:18 - game Tim all right waiting for player
102:25 - should get him here there we go okay you
102:28 - are white my turn Oh ran out of input 51
102:35 - what the heck is that
102:41 - invalid load key I know it doesn't it's
102:46 - literally it's yeah it's weird
102:48 - PLC invalid load
102:55 - pickle the air you get is a standard
102:58 - error yet when the network gets with
103:01 - wrong file format what causes the error
103:04 - what the heck
103:14 - [Music]
103:21 - most common pickles to pickle everything
103:23 - with a single dump to a file but then
103:25 - you have to load everything at once with
103:27 - a single load however if you open a file
103:29 - here and it'll do multiple dump calls
103:31 - then your load will mirror that your
103:34 - open we're trying to achieve
103:49 - okay it'll be relevant I had some a
103:57 - problem when the pickle archive had been
103:58 - created using gzip compressed pickle
104:01 - archive has been like this try to open
104:03 - it throws errors but if the pickle is
104:05 - open gzip all is harmonious hmm
104:13 - unpicking err unbowed load key I don't
104:16 - know what that means
104:20 - try to unpick 'el something that had not
104:23 - originally been pickled yeah I know what
104:30 - truncated is I know I fixed like that
104:32 - one's a pretty easy fix but it just this
104:34 - one is kind of weird okay so reply Oh
104:40 - pickle dot loads
104:41 - am I ever sending anything back that's
104:44 - not what did this client used to look
104:48 - like now I don't have the old version of
104:51 - oh I do have the old version of client I
104:52 - can look at that chess game and it was
104:57 - ideal Eve yeah this game is built on
105:00 - Python whoever asked that pic equals
105:07 - okay if pick something like that send
105:14 - people the thumbs ok reply the only
105:17 - thing this should receive
105:23 - is pickled Dada though
105:29 - so wonder if I'm ever sending any downa
105:32 - back that's not pickles self declined a
105:35 - sentence during not encode data applying
105:37 - was something I'd receive if I was
105:41 - people download your ploy turn play
105:44 - [Music]
105:47 - let's see this pickle download reply ok
106:02 - so I don't know how I'm getting that
106:03 - error now that I've added this timeout
106:13 - so I don't know if I need this like
106:16 - timeout thing anymore let's get rid of
106:18 - this I know I could've just shift-tab
106:21 - this but you know we didn't do that so
106:23 - let's get rid of the hots so try this
106:26 - now and let's open this with ideally
106:30 - such a scheme game oh we don't need
106:40 - break anymore them okay let's edit this
106:43 - break you guys I said you guys I love
106:45 - how you guys are still trying to connect
106:47 - just the persistency I love it um okay
106:50 - let's try this game I feel like he was
106:53 - working better at the beginning then I
106:54 - mess with all this stuff and now who
106:56 - knows
106:56 - alright someone join should I use Python
107:02 - as hacking purpose I don't know man I'm
107:05 - just waiting for someone to connect so I
107:06 - can play against someone alright my
107:10 - chain Oh player Tim left game let's see
107:15 - what is our issue here why did that
107:17 - dinosaur ideally
107:24 - Tim you just instantly disconnects now
107:26 - so that's interesting
107:30 - where's my freaking thing server offline
107:37 - service not off on there just oh my gosh
107:41 - other player left holy crap
107:46 - router the input ran out of input menu
107:49 - screen missing one required potential
107:52 - argument name Oh gonna fix that okay
107:55 - bytes object has actually ready ran out
107:57 - of input ran out of input so it's
108:03 - something with the sending yeah I don't
108:08 - know man I am NOT a Python developer no
108:11 - well I mean I don't know what do you
108:12 - consider a Python developer I do a lot
108:14 - of development with Python but I don't
108:15 - have a job as a Python developer ran out
108:18 - of input data stream to go thumbs Bo
108:22 - which is the board client pickle dot
108:27 - loads fly
108:42 - I don't know guys
108:52 - don't know what is going on here it's
108:54 - sending back the board it's now we're
109:02 - getting an issue here we're like we're
109:07 - like all menu screen button menu screen
109:09 - win name could fix that okay let's just
109:16 - dress again it's like you need some
109:22 - break no breaks what I break I'm just
109:25 - gonna get off this to be honest I still
109:26 - haven't even eaten dinner yet so I got
109:28 - to do that probably go for another few
109:30 - minutes see how this works
109:33 - Tim all right load that up I don't know
109:36 - why that doesn't come to the forefront
109:40 - unpicking stack on unpicking stack
109:43 - underflow that's a new one let's try
109:46 - this one I think now it's time to read
109:51 - maybe you're gonna restart the server I
109:52 - don't know I haven't restarted the
109:55 - server in a while try that address
110:02 - already in you so I closed it too quick
110:03 - and this oh my god it doesn't okay under
110:13 - pickling understand a flourish and
110:17 - pickling under flow here this is what
110:21 - this when pickle ends unexpectedly here
110:26 - self to request to receive your
110:27 - seemingly 12 bytes max you pick a large
110:28 - must be longer than 12 bytes so gets cut
110:30 - off I would not recommend to handling
110:32 - TCP sockets directly unless you're very
110:34 - familiar with networking and you need
110:36 - high-performance justing HTTP to wrap
110:38 - your messages in using HTTP library if
110:40 - you do have to be able T to be directly
110:42 - of two choices you can agree on a
110:44 - terminal string
110:52 - when you up this code is on github guys
110:55 - console gave me air 32 broken pipe oh my
110:59 - god alright so it's just a socket error
111:09 - listen process could not create a
111:11 - dedicated process to handle the client
111:13 - requests the error is caused by a
111:14 - resource exhaustion issue either with
111:16 - the OS or within the Oracle Oh God
111:19 - socket air air 32 broken pipe also the
111:25 - following may need to be changed ok so I
111:37 - just gotta find a better way to send
111:44 - large pickle over socket
111:52 - okay hmm socket our byte stream so
112:16 - ideally to write your protocol read this
112:18 - this is a bass amp without protocol
112:20 - should be careful but buffer receive oh
112:23 - yeah because okay so pickle a file over
112:27 - socket IO bytes IO what does that do
112:48 - hmm so the way that I'm sending this
112:54 - data is just like bad that's that's
112:58 - that's the issue python pickle pickling
113:03 - over socket I don't want to read all
113:07 - that
113:16 - Pikul the loads case how do you get size
113:20 - of pic Madonna why would the sink a
113:25 - happy birthday
113:25 - it's interesting pickled data Python
113:44 - since the size of serialized pickle of
113:46 - knowledge can be quite different from
113:47 - the size of the object in memory
113:50 - we should probably persist 5 bytes how
113:52 - to get byte size of pickled out in
113:56 - Python
114:04 - okay I'm just gonna try this again run
114:15 - f5 Tim
114:23 - playing against Johnny right now I don't
114:26 - know who Johnny is but let's see if if
114:27 - we can get a game going other player
114:28 - left pickle data was truncated by table
114:31 - because not she ready all right guys so
114:35 - it's almost been two hours how long has
114:38 - it been actually and we're not really
114:41 - getting anywhere here I'm gonna look at
114:42 - this and see what I can do with the
114:47 - sending of data I think that all I
114:50 - really need to figure out and I you guys
114:52 - have obviously helped me realize this is
114:55 - um that the the way this data is sending
115:00 - is just not it's just not good I need a
115:03 - better way to send this data so well not
115:06 - send receive the data sending it is
115:09 - actually fine I need a better way to
115:11 - receive it on the the client and a
115:13 - better way to send it from the server
115:14 - and so if I just sit down and focus on
115:18 - this like half an hour she probably
115:20 - figured out but I am gonna end the
115:21 - stream now big thank you to everyone who
115:24 - joined again another thank you to cherry
115:26 - servers for hooking me up with that
115:27 - server definitely not their fault that
115:29 - this isn't working I just probably you
115:30 - know messed something up and I really do
115:32 - appreciate everyone helping me out on
115:33 - this I had a good time chatting with you
115:36 - guys and do this unfortunately I
115:37 - couldn't get it to work but you know
115:38 - sometimes that's how it goes and now I'm
115:40 - gonna learn from the mistakes and
115:41 - hopefully be able to fix this and do
115:43 - something better in the next time you
115:44 - guys have any other ideas for streams or
115:46 - more stuff that you want to see
115:48 - definitely let me know I really enjoy
115:51 - doing these streams and like if I can do
115:52 - some more shorter ones that are only
115:54 - like 2 hours long that fits my time
115:56 - schedule kind of a little bit better cuz
115:58 - the last ones I did were like 2 3 4 like
116:00 - no what am I saying
116:02 - they were like 12 and 18 hours long so
116:05 - yeah anyways guys once again thank you
116:08 - gonna hop off the stream now and I
116:10 - definitely will if you guys subscribe to
116:11 - the channel you guys will know when I do
116:13 - more streams and all that kind of fun
116:14 - stuff so see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

if you're playing game of chess and the server goes down or you get disconnected or something like that um but yeah so anyway slip I'll be live right now okay so I'm sorry I just had an issue with the stream I don't know what you guys heard or what you didn't hear let me know but again online multiplayer chess we're gonna be playing this today there's a bunch of bugs we need to figure out we're gonna be doing that for the first 15 20 minutes please don't get too frustrated if we go through stuff and I've already repeated this I'm sorry but um I don't know if you guys can see me or not again this is always a bit buggy alright so first of all before I get too far into the stream I need to give a massive shoutout to cherry servers for hooking me up with a really awesome server for today's stream I'm gonna be using the server for a few videos in future series as well and anyways just massive shout out to cherry servers definitely go check out their website here you can rent servers for like 10 15 cents an hour they're really good they have an awesome support team and they've just been a pleasure to work with so massive shout to them definitely check out their website there's a link in the description and again just thank you guys so much from cherry servers because without you this would not have been paulus have been possible alright so now let me show you guys how you can actually connect and start playing this game so a little tutorial first so that everyone knows how to kind of get set up here so if you're tuning into the stream later just I guess rewind back and see this but anyways if you go to my github link in the description link in the pinned comment you should see a page that looks like this now there's a readme file here and it literally just goes through exactly how to do everything so what you need to do is download this repository and run the game dot PI file now I tried to make this as intuitive as possible and when you run the game top high file I wrote a script that should automatically install PI game and pip for you if this doesn't work you're gonna have to mess with installing pip and PI game yourself again let me know if there's any issues use the stream chat use the github chat for issues I'm gonna be checking and we're kind of just gonna be tweaking things to the first 1520 minutes so please you know bear with me on that guys but anyways follow this instructions try to connect the servers live right now if you double click the game top high file you should actually get hooked up I can see a few people joining on the server right now and before we you know go too far I will kind of walk through some of the code and how this works but if you guys want to go in the background and kind of be listening to this while I go through the instructions feel free we've already got 4 people connected to games going and yeah we'll just be going through all that so do this get this working github link in the description I'm just repeating this because everyone is like just joining in the stream so I want to make sure people see it if they're just coming on now but remind people in the stream chat and all of that so the server specs that I actually got I got a 4 core or starting out 4 core 4 Xeon processors to 1080 TI's the one i have is actually only 16 gigabytes of ram but i was supposed to get 64 but like something messed up with that and then i think i have like what do you call it some i don't know how much space at like 250 gigabyte SSD or something uh alright let me just see what's going on here i'm running into a few issues on the server again guys i gotta fix a bunch of stuff as we go through but that's what I'm gonna be doing now just fixing some of the stuff on the server side and just bear with me keep connecting the server try to play the games if you run into bugs please let me know inside because I'm relying on you guys to help me test this out and then I also implemented a spectator mode into this because it we're getting key errors here yeah you guys can't connect Kay I'm gonna shut down the server right now guys I'll be back on in one second oh just there's a key error I know how to fix this it just gonna take a second because when you guys are connecting to the games it's just it's a little buggy here I'm so Len of games ok I see here so if connections watches 2 equals 0 yeah so again guys just get that stuff going and then we'll we'll get this all working here I just gotta figure out this issue because I have something where like each game is represented by a key in the dictionary if you join the key era can sometimes be off um and and only that so we'll have to fix and work with this what I might actually do is just get it so that this is gonna be a little bit difficult G equals zero let's see here I think I'm just gonna pick a game that doesn't have two connections on it and add you on that how big is the foot you guys asked me all these questions I'll get to them in a second I just really want to get this working with the key areas I haven't had many people on it at once so again we're gonna have some issues going as we get through here is the line of games minus zero is this open source yeah guys this is open source you can go look at everything on github okay so let's just get a list of all the keys and then we'll assign a player based on the amount of connections oh we shouldn't do it based on connections because then connections are just 2 equals equals zero yeah so this was an issue I knew I was gonna run into creating new games so this is gonna be difficult to create new games and assign people into the games I haven't had this many people connect and even with you guys like 10 20 people connecting it um it just broke here so we'll have to see how to fix this so what I was trying to do right now is say after every 2 people connect it um creates a new game but what was happening was if people are connecting and they're just instantly leaving and then it wasn't working okay let's just do it we'll do one more test run with this server running and then see if we can get this to to work ok guys to try to connect to the game connection reset by P try to connect I'm gonna be monitoring this server here and I might even connect in a second as you might get my spectator mode to work but I need you guys to connect before I can see if everything is actually working or not again if you're unfamiliar with how to do this this should be the repo that you download should look like this except you want to have this server file most likely and then just double click on game and it should load you up into the chess game I'm gonna show you guys what it looks like in a second but I need enough people to connect it I can get in what's called spectator mode let me see what I can do this now other player left spectator mode is not working so I gotta fix that too Oh a bunch of people are leaving new player connected connection reset by pier number of connections through a number of games to let me know if this is working for you guys or not if you're in games or not because again I don't know game one ended player none left game one kierra player left yeah okay I don't think this is working yet guys so we gotta give it a second here if you're in the game please let me know in the chat guys I haven't heard set had anyone tell me about any issues or not in the chat yet so I gotta see okay I'm gonna stop the server and we're just gonna get this this fixed currently because this is a bit of an issue so I was having this thing where I was like deleting games I think I'm just gonna stop deleting games and just add more keys into the dictionary so when I create a new game so game connections but oh that's why it's not working okay so we'll say current underscore game underscore ID again guys just give me a minute or two let me know if you have any bugs please I really do care if you have the bugs because I need to fix them yeah I know the server's offline is going online in a second okay so we'll say G equals current underscore game underscore ID and we'll just say after every two connections so it'll say like yeah if connections modules two equals zero then we'll just create a new game with current game ID so current current underscore game ID underscore game underscore ID and then we'll add one to that okay so that needs to be incremented plus equals one and then G equals current game ID and then Ralad we won't delete any games which is what I was doing at some point here F Dell yeah we don't need to do this game ended get rid of that okay so let's try this now I just got to push this code over to the server and then we should be able to actually run that desktop chess game server I'm hoping this is as easy as the fixes because if it's not then you know we're gonna be run into some issues here I'm also just gonna modify this specs file all right okay run that no it's not what I want to do same thing again okay there we go all right let's go guys connect now and see if this is working I've already have two games new player connected number of connections 1 number of games oh yeah the number of games output here is gonna be wrong but that's fine let me try to connect now I had this all working before I don't know what's going on I think it's just you guys are flooding me with games and I don't know I didn't code the server well enough to handle this let's run a game name there we go so I'm waiting for player let's see if someone else joins in if I can get in the game with someone here so whoever's gonna join next is gonna be in my game oh there we go I'm in a game ok let's select let me play ok um his turn holy crap a lot of you guys are joining oh my god ok well I did not expect this to happen I did not expect this many people to have to join the game immediately Jesus okay yeah this will be interesting to see if this works if you guys can see my this is my server screen right now oh my god okay people are leaving people are joining yeah oh this is gonna be really interesting okay whoever's playing against me needs to make a move because I'm waiting for them right now I'm gonna have to leave the game if they take too long holy crap Jesus yeah if you guys can't tell us a little bit some guy named himself hey Tim Tims time oh I'm waiting player to left this game clearly block is winner okay let me just do this again um oh my god okay I'll run through all this code works but I want to see if this is gonna work Tim let's run a game here okay I'm with blue jay all right blue jay your turn buddy let's go what's okay he moved there on black alright let's see if he can play with me by the way guys you see this mug available for purchase you can go right underneath he wears it underneath the description you should be able to see that so I'm just testing out the game this is what it looks like I'm in a game right now with blue jay it seems to be working but yeah let me know if you guys what's going on with you ran out of input on pickling stack under flow service server offline okay that's an issue there's gonna be a lot of stuff that I'm gonna need to fix here and by the way I'm just gonna like don't get too attached to your chess game because I'm gonna have to shut down the server at random times and fix stuff but I don't know I think this is pretty interesting and you guys can see the kind of I look at my server code right now look what's happening look how many people are connected I have these connections are wrong we have 40 not that's wrong for games to like people are just joining leaving you can see this guy left game 48 alright see I just keep joining in guys we'll keep testing this and this probably is about like 24 hours worth of coding because the stream that I did it in I only went for 18 hours did I not move what is happening here yeah this is not correct I'm trying to join a game but I'm still waiting server offline yeah this is gonna be a little bit of fixing so the stream might go longer than I expected um okay let me quit this game he can be the winner of that one and let's get in a new one and see what I can get going here there's some latency issues here um oh my god okay join all right I am block there turn who's going here Sahil is playing that right now joins time oh my god okay yeah so clearly this this is not working at the same level that I I thought it would well we'll see if we can get this going soon oh my god okay guys let me know your your errors please send them in the chat because I need to know what is going on here Tim see player one time Tim time okay I can move but it still says player one I don't even know if I'm in a game with someone oh my god okay he is going so I heated messages named himself thought so when you guys load up it should ask you to input like a name Adam at some point but yeah let me know how this is going for you guys for me this seems to be working like okay obviously there's some bugs I got a tune out here oh hey Reb you thank you for the $1 super chat man appreciate that but yeah I mean we'll see if we can get this going and these seems like the naming thing seems to have some issues too yeah I was trying to add some castling in here as well after but I was getting some kind of issues with the castling so we'll see like if you guys try to castle and see if your castling works and let me know so I'm using a bun I cannot resize window it's bigger on my laptop screen oh god sorry about that I can't really help you with that um well why wouldn't he take my that's an interesting decision ok let's take that I'm not very good at chess either by the way guys I don't know why I decided to create chess but I did let's see here okay how many guys have we got in here right now seven connections 71 games that's because we're not clearing games I'm just incrementing IDs of games when will you continue the tower game at some point I'll continue the tower game where's my pie game script my turn hmm okay so this is working for me guys let me know if this is working for you again people are gonna be leaving joining all that kind of stuff and showed it to review thank you for the super chat 5 bucks again loving your videos and helped me so much in my programming journey appreciate you mate thank you man I appreciate you that super chats awesome means a lot man thank you okay guys I'm gonna do I'm gonna start writing some more code so I apologize whoever I'm playing right now playing against right now I'm gonna write some code to hopefully fix the server a little bit but again I need you guys to let me know in the chat if it's working or if it's not because that's gonna be like that I need I need to know that otherwise this is not gonna go very well you guys need to tell me what's going wrong with all these videos try to castle as well because castling is like a huge thing that I was trying to work on earlier and I want to see if that's working if you don't know what castle is it's like when you switch the king with the rook and the way that I did is you have to click the rook to go to the king so what I want to do now is number of games should really just be equal to number of connections over to I don't even know I don't even think I could show the number of games running pickle Dada was truncated load key 8 server offline Oh God okay um pickle Dada was truncated that one's it I have to change that now take a look okay let's just do that um alright so for those of you that don't know how this works essentially I have these these are all my scripts okay and what happens is I have this server code running on this external linux server it is this one right here that you guys can see and it's handling all the connections in and out of this game now what it's doing is it's storing the games on the server and then it's sending those games like the data for those games to each player so what happens is when someone moves in one game it will move like in the other game that they're connected with now the issue that I'm having right now is having all these different games running at once I obviously haven't programmed the server to work well enough to do this so you can see like people just keep disconnecting and reconnecting but I was in a game and it was working fine for me so I mean I don't know what like is wrong with other people unless people just keep leaving immediately and playing against other people and if you want to post like formal issues code whatever on the issue page on the github then I can look on that as well and I'm gonna be updating that get up if I make changes to the code here so I just want to print the number of connections when people connect now and when people disconnect I'm saying the connections let's see here oh okay so keeping track of the connections is something that I need to do better now because if you for some reason like if you got this exception does it break when you get this exception no it doesn't break hmm hmm if not gaming games okay all right I think the server codes fine we're just gonna keep testing this running server with two connections we got two games going right now try to stay in the game if you guys can for like a fair amount of time just to test out if this is working now I have this spectator mode that I had implemented but for some reason the spectator mode wasn't working I'm gonna try to fix that and also this is the main game script and what I did at the top here is I did all this jazz so that if you don't have pip or you don't have PI game installed what happens is it automatically installs it for you so it just implements this thing there's actually a script called get pip and it has the bytecode for pip you can see it's like 21,000 lines or something and so you don't actually have to install pip because I have the actual pip in the file and then what happens is it imports that file and then it tries to use that to install pion how can I talk to it maybe working because you're running the server on your network no no the server's no guys this server is sorry this server is running on like an external server like this servers in like Lithuania or something I don't even know where it is but it's um it's not working it's not running on my network so you guys will be able to join the game and I can see like hey left game J bros left game number of connections number of games that should be changed I'm gonna restart the server guys because I just need to change one thing here and modify so we don't I don't get this weird game output anymore because that game output is not correct now I had this really cool spectator mode that I coded and it was working and then now it's not working so that's great but we'll see if I can get it to work I just want to comment out this comment save X okay so I'm gonna try to work on getting this what do you call it's the spectator mode to work from my end you guys just keep playing and let me know again if you have issues and we're just gonna peace through this and hopefully by the time we hit like in the next 1015 minutes everything will be working and I can just play against some of you guys and just chat with you on the live stream you if you guys are new here to join the game link in the description go to the Hubb I think I'd probably still have it up and there's instructions on how to get the game running on your thing you can skip step 1 as it should just install PI game for you automatically this is the repo and I haven't modified anything from the game end so it should just work for you guys now I'm gonna try to get the spectator thing working because for me it's having this spectator thing this spectator issue hey guys left game 7 hey Tim left game 8 J Bros so guys oh you guys hate Tim J Bros 2 are you guys leaving the game or is it kicking you from the game that's something that I need to know and like connection reset by Pierre I don't know what issue that is there's a ton of stuff that I don't know so we have to see like if this is working or not J Bros I see you in the chat are you leaving the games or are you being kicked from the game and thank you for congratulations on 30 K um okay so let's upload update this file you guys can't know it's a nut so I'm gonna have to hide that C this year I'm just gonna have someone just send me a message on discord here so I'm just gonna have to grab this here so keep going guys I'm reading the chat if you have any questions let me know but if you have the errors please send them because we get we're just going through the debugging stage I know it's kind of boring right now but that's all we can really do until I figure out what these issues are but it does look to be working like fairly well to be quite honest with you so we'll see you know if we can get this going alright hey Tim left game eights number of connections for its kicking me kicked me out a game it's kicking me okay um how is it kicking you guys out of the game is it just randomly are you just randomly being kicked or what's going on is it like disconnect disconnect disconnect what would what will happen in some instances is you'll be kicked if the other player leaves so that could be the instance but you should see a message that says like you've you've been kicked from the game if once I get this spectator mode going I'll be able to do it a bit easier like looking through the games okay here a bunch of people just joined and a bunch of people got kicked connection reset player W wanting game 9 Xen burr left game 9 okay let me run a script here and let's see if we can get this going randomly kicked yeah um okay one second guys holy crap people are just disconnecting connecting left game 17 player none left game 17 hmm okay let me print out the errors from the server side and then I'll try to fix some of them I'm just gonna restart the script guys sorry about that okay so server should be printing these exceptions so I have this try here if it's a server end issue it should just print them if it's not hmm let's see cuz when you disconnect that either men's means you left or it means that you know something happens so let's see here if not game okay let's run the server again okay so it seems to work like at the beginning somewhat players end bar left game one right like I don't know if that's randomly kicking him or if he's joining in the game um let's see here let me get in the game here hmm so my spectator mode thing isn't working expected your luck game zero let's see if I can get this in here yeah I know it's giving me all this um spectator left game zero oh it's cuz it's okay that'd probably be why let's see your game yeah okay I'm gonna have to reset the server one more time guys sorry about that just delete that alright see if I can get in one here Tim okay there we go there turn I'm playing against this guy now let's see how long I can get this to go for and then I'll see what's going on with your guys games but for me when I do this it seems to be working fairly well to be honest for like my game end but I don't know also these times are messed up p1p2 so I oh this just changed hey Tim's time Zen bars game so the names are getting messed up that's it make a kickin tag on server I don't I don't randomly kick people that's the thing I don't know why people people are getting kicked out he's moving that okay so there's some latency issues here as well hmm okay but like I'm playing against someone here whoever's playing against me let me know if any of you guys are like successfully playing a game of chest against someone um let me know that and that would be helpful to know yeah see now I can't like I can't move right now it just seems frozen connection reset hey Tim's okay I'm gonna quit that and let him go if you want to quit the game it's better if you click Q to quit um hmm disconnect disconnect player to connection reset I don't know what this connection reset by peer means I'm gonna look that up okay keyboard interrupt let's run this again you guys can keep messing with that let me know the errors I'm gonna look up some stuff here connection reset by peer high amount of traffic okay so it may actually be a traffic issue that's that's causing this I'm just gonna make a modification in here and see if I can can fix this by just getting rid of I have like a timers yeah I don't know if that's gonna work I don't know if this is a traffic issue or what's wrong here I'm the winner tag on the server yeah okay connection reset by peer let's see air 404 hmm seems a serverside limits the amount of requests per time out as a security issue you need to guess how many maybe using the script with a counter and adjust your script to surpass the limit okay so what the issue I'm having apparently and why you guys are getting kicked is because there's too much traffic going on right now there's too many games running at once which is something I anticipated so what I'm gonna need to do is just make it so that the refresh rate to the server is slower but that means that it's gonna be like whale a gear when you guys are running this so I'm gonna increase it um what you guys are gonna have to do is read download this github repo just redownload it and just run game 2 up high again I I just made the change so just redownload and try to it you can see like people are just getting holy crap Jesus okay umm redownload the repo I'm shutting the server down right now if you see you guys have a chance to do this and we'll see if this fixes it a little bit if it doesn't honestly I don't really know what's going on but I what I really want to get the spectator mode thing working so I wanted to go through and see this in my mind this was gonna work a lot smoother than it has but I mean you know not everything works perfectly I also need why not my ask you with the server on the web so the traffic's better no man I'm not gonna recode a server right now I'm just like messing with it as we speak games zero board okay so we need to get rid of this first of all okay so first thing we should do if connections modulus to equals it with zero current underscore game ID plus equals one game's current ID okay but then connections goes down with someone else joins which means current game ID hmm there's got to be a better way to connect people into games because what's happening is like someone will connect and someone will leave and the connections will be lower and then you're gonna get in a different game based on your connections which we don't want so create a new game know that current game ID plus equals 1 if connections by just 2 equals 0 okay let's see here make a server handler for games yeah I have I have oh yeah print create new game I could do that but redownload that guy's for right now I'm gonna modify it on my end too and see if all I did is just add a timer essentially so that it doesn't it goes slower and when it's grabbing information which means it's gonna be kind of annoying but yeah you guys you guys will see how it works invalid game okay disconnect spectator left game that's spectator mode let's see an exception so if you leave while the peer is reset okay this does Python a private and public instances no I'm just trying to find a better way to assign people into games so that we keep hmm like you should really be deleting the old games keep so the current game ID is like that makes sense you add to the current game ID I can delete the other game which will kick someone out I don't know how exactly to go about doing this um let's see so what I had before I want to look at what I had before on the server actually let me go to the github and have a look at this and maybe I can just redownload that code and try again here from server okay let's go to chess game that's fine server okay so what I had essentially was let's see here oh no I didn't have the tries and except though if like for some reason something didn't work like you got disconnected it would delete that instance of the game which would cause the other person to get disconnected that worked for me when I just had like two or three people going at once so I don't know why it's not working now let's let me download this new cept exception okay and commit that all right I'm just gonna literally copy that it's got our raw okay we're gonna just try what I had last time again I said I'm gonna get rid of this address cuz I don't want you guys to see people's IP addresses new connection connection we'll get rid of this data as well because we don't actually we can print the line of games I think you need a lobby than a cube games yeah you'd be correct that I've put people into a lobby first and then IQ I just like right the plan of the car so you guys are aware the plan of this dream was not to write very much code at all like I was just planning on just releasing this and being like go play have fun I wasn't honestly expecting this many people to be playing so that's why maybe I can limit the amount of connections okay look I'm gonna try with the limit and it'll cue you like it'll if I do limit then it won't actually that'll just break you out okay let me try one let me try with the limit so if the connections I will only run like three games at once and see if I can get that working maybe let's see you know what let's just try this connections minus equals one really what's wrong with that that is except oh I forgot to comment out that and I don't need to go back in that nano watch a bit server okay let's try this yeah this is not going as smoothly as I was hoping okay someone's connected let's let's try this I'm really scared to keep running the server because then you guys just overload it like immediately I have it's a good server but I just I just my programming right there's nothing wrong with the server let's run a game it's gonna be I'm gonna be spectator mode right now aren't I oh there we go okay I'm playing against blue jays holy crap okay um so server's going down one more time I'm gonna fix it again I thought I remember that was the issue I ran into we're just gonna loop through the keys and just assign you into the next game if that doesn't work so say if G is less than all right if G not in games then we'll just add a new game so we'll say games say games and then zero was bored 8 comma 8 will do games G actually that should work should I be using a VPN no no you don't need a VPN I'm not stealing your IP don't worry um okay let's fix this No yeah whoever it's someone said in the chat cool idea brave project you're correct a very brave project I already had like I address already in use oh great that's gonna be an issue yeah you guys can see here like this is what the server is that's 8 as 8 cores tasks to 37 through 1 running ok let's let's close out any Python tasks I have right now I feel like the firewall on the server might be blocking all these connections back that's a very possible issue I'm just gonna monitor this server tab you guys go ahead and try to connect her we got one connection let's see what's going on alright guys try to connect I want to see if I can get this going or not we got one connection right now let me run one no I forgot I have two connection reset by peer Connect connect holy crap disconnect player none left game 0 number connections to so works with 2 games what happens when we have three games because right now there's two games running and I don't see any issues with three connections so it means someone's waiting to queue for game so if I try to go in now and now it's just work anymore oh wait okay your block their turn okay I'm playing against someone see if they can move like I don't seem to get kicked right away when I do this but a lot of people seem to just be like instantly being disconnected oh now I'm playing against someone else so what's actually happening here is other people are joining my game like when someone leaves this game someone else actually gets put into this game which is not obviously what you want what you want when someone leaves it it deletes that game um so you get kicked you can see this is this guy's turn he's not going so I'm just gonna quit and then play again um see if I can get in a game here I've had a few decent ones going waiting for player so that's me I'm the third connection see if someone else comes in here and see if this works um yeah trace my module named name era name Jake is not to find so someone else left ok guys someone joint okay now it's my turn all right sweet I'm playing against someone playing against bluejay this guy's can shout out to bluejay he has consistently been joining these games I've seen him in it like all the time do this ok so I'm playing I'm playing a civil game of chess right now and this seems to be working and this is against again one of the viewers right now blue jay and nothing's going on with our game like at least that I'm noticing there's nothing happening so we'll see here you have to put your name in quotations no you don't have to put your name the quotation your name should just be like text if you type numbers and stuff you might like run into an issue Oh connection so bluej either left that hmm connection reset by pierre blur none left game to get guys options right now we can keep I can keep trying I can set a limit on the amount of connections and see if that fixes things like just set it some max like 10 games running at once or something like that or I can try to program to fix it so infinite people can connect you guys can let me know what you want to see in the stream again I'm just doing this for fun I want to chat with some of you guys I'm not really too bothered that it's not working as well as I was hoping it would because I kind of expected that to be honest with you but um again you guys have to let me know what you want to see from that number of games oh ok let's get rid of this spectator thing the spectator of code is just not working if G not in games games G or what I think I should do is loop through all the games see if they're ready and if they're not ready then just put that player in the game so maybe that's what I'll do to determine the games so we don't get these weird connection issues so yeah ok so let's try that so let's say for game and games keys if game I guess oh it's gonna be keys will say if games game dot ready equals it goes false then we'll just throw someone in that game so I'll just say game say G equals game um with this new bytes object has no attribute ready oh that would have not unpick olden time holy crap okay I didn't miss any Super chats here tonight cuz someone gave me oh it's okay says I have eight dollars in revenue but it's because of its like us to get to Canadian conversion alright let me rerun the server guys again I apologize for all this mess I really wish this was working a bit better but you know we'll see server let's see if I can get this going now override okay so by the way in case you're confused this is win SCP or something which is just allowing me to FTP to the server so that I don't have to like do like I don't know edit the code on the server could you not compile this into an exe I could but I'd like then I'd have to you guys I'd have to keep working with stuff so just easier to do this okay let's try this now I'm game Tim connect all right waiting for player player B 1 in game 0 so I mean someone quits hey Tim left game 0 okay I'm waiting for someone enjoy my game right now there we go in so someone joined they got put in my game that's blue J sweet let's run it I've been playing against this guy like the whole time this is this is funny alright connection reset by peer I can't I don't know how to fix that issue so if the connection resets like how do you get a too much traffic to the socket holy I could set a time so there's too much traffic that's the issue I'm too much traffic on the server that's that's what we've figured out is the issue so it's working sometimes but then we just get randomly kicked because there's too much traffic all right so let's say socket Python too much traffic let's see if I can fix that you guys can keep messing with it what is the name cache when you set by peer it's fatal the remote server has sent you an rst packet which indicates an immediate dropping in the connection this means is disconnect connect yeah so connection reset by peer is the issue oh I can raise the socket time out issue okay let's try that and then that way okay socket time out raise Python let's see here that's all I want to raise that okay I want to raise the socket time out let's see this so you got eliminate yeah I have to limit like how this is low level networking socket how to catch socket time out set default timeout let me see what sockets default timeout is and then set it higher default timeout Python so what I've determined is happening I don't know if this is correct or not is um that it just there's so much traffic then it's not sending back in time and then it's just dropping the connection be the same well you cannot connecting I'm just gonna disconnect so I want to raise that socket timeout if so if I can do that then hopefully this will be work better timeout curses socket timeout okay so subclass socket time a note I don't know what the default socket timeout is I don't know what the thing is that it takes set timeout value set a time and I'm blocking socket operations the value may be nonnative floatingpoint number expressed seconds okay so if that's seconds then let's just set that timeout to like five seconds and five seconds should be plenty of time for that at it socket default timeout five okay so let's run that now and see if I gets to work almost work install pie game for the impressive stuff man yeah then the script that I wrote to install pie game was um I was pretty impressed by that to be quite honest with you guys I'd show you one but like it just makes sure that if you have don't have pie game it automatically I'm oh god it's still not working very well if you're wondering what I'm doing I'm just pouring water into my mug um connect/disconnect Game one ended connections okay uh Pierre okay I don't think it's working guys let's see this server offline try again yeah yeah yeah that's yeah um kierra zero Pierre Pierre here connection reset Pierre so I need to handle that key err what line is that happening on 49 from threaded client oh hey Terry how you doing um okay so let's let's fix that Keir now so I'm getting this I mean this Kiera four games game which means a game clearly it's just not but that it should be a key cuz for game and game stock keys if games game got ready equals equals false G equals game past game that should just work that's not working we need to just try accept that done um bo games games try except when you don't know what to do just put in a try and accept just break that um alright let's try this print error game does not exist maybe we might have to do a like part two to the stream where Tim actually like fixes this and makes it work properly I thought the most common issue was just the timeout issue which I thought I could fix by just setting it bigger but also I'm wondering now where are most of you guys that are connecting let me know in the chat like are you guys in India are you in like Canada are you in Europe because that's probably gonna influence how this works with the timeout issue yeah that's probably gonna have some effect on the timeout again I don't know but let's break outside oh my god okay you fixed that break how do I do this is past okay so if that's the issue then bo games game let's just pick one that's do we use game any rails game if game not in games break so it should do that here Bo games game Bo to start user Bo games game so it'll just it's just crashes I okay try I don't know what's wrong with this I'm in Canada I'm in u.s. sorry wow I'm in I'm in Brazil you drink water from mug yes I do Ottawa sweet okay so we got people from all over USA Indonesia yeah I don't know I don't really know what the issue is to be honest I think it's also a thing like I'm sending a crazy amount of bytes like a lot of information like you can see this is how much it's sending every time so that could be an issue too maybe I'd like at some point you know I can have a look at this when I'm more focused not on stream and try to fix this um we'll keep going with it though okay so connections plus equal one con dot send out a string vo equals games game that doesn't work let's just pick another game so we already have the script to do that so if games game dot ready okay let's try this let's say bo equals games game check Instagram DM great proposition Tim alright let's check well I'll check through my stuff in a second guys okay let's try to run this again I know the server's offline right now so you guys won't be seeing anything I'm server yes but like this works for twoplayer I might just max the connections at two and play against some of you guys and like if this doesn't work if you guys are interested in doing that let me know or maybe make it like two games running at once and then hopefully that can like make things a bit better cuz again I don't really know what's going wrong with this Tim yeah it's hilarious the second that I start it like a ton of people join in so I know you guys are just like waiting to queue in the game when was this I hear new connections who's keeps naming themself hi Tim okay I'm playing now against someone see how long this can see how long this works I'm playing against blue Jeff why I always play against blue J I think it just me Blue Jay left game hey Tim left game connection reset by Pierre I still I don't get I'm from Greece I still cannot connect oh so I tried ping server's IP and has a hundred milliseconds latency is not too long maybe some thing other is the problem Poland dude yeah you're Bo reference before assignment that's an issue game does not exist okay let's try this again try accept print err game does not exist okay let's not do that just go and so pass well vo equals games games Bo is here though so this should be fun um you know reference before assignment where's that issue be able to start user current ID line sixtythree that shouldn't be an issue should have Bo should be defined Oh if so otherwise so you say if you notice it Bo equals none if not Bo then create a new game some will say I need to global current game I will just do it by connections I guess we'll just create a new game set games connection over to hmm okay I'm gonna leave this running you guys can still try messing with it I think I'm just gonna focus dial in here and try to fix this with this it just it has to be something with just the game queuing and just something like that unless people are quitting from like the client side but I don't think there's something wrong with the client side and if there was then it should be spitting out the error to you guys when the game crashes so if you see those errors let me know but um let's just try to get this working if try bo games game so I want to have a unique ID for each game but I'm doing it based on connections but I can't do it based on connections because if I do it based on connections then it just like that doesn't work okay so deleting games try Dell games games connections it was one game game ended disconnected player okay that should work get rid of this say Pio eCos games games I got a 56 number a few times and running it oh my I don't even know what's up at that I'll run the game side and see what's up about to you it's funny because this works so well like I've run I'd had like four games running um like on my computer and like my brother's computer and they was working fine but now it's just not working at all let's just do this let's not go based on connections what I think I'm gonna do is just loop through all the games that exist see if first of all those get whole hmm I could just set rather than creating all these new games I could just set like five games have people join I don't know if want to do that either so many different ways to possibly do this if connections modules to equals equals zero games connections over to or eight I don't think I'm even I think I'm just gonna loop through and see if there's any games that aren't ready yet ABB's someone into that game and if there's no games then just create a new one okay so for game and game dog keys if game game to already equals false G equals game okay perfect will say if I will just say G equals negative one here if G equals negative one then we'll say games zero equals and in this case games not ready game zero but how are we ever gonna have game one then G equals equals negative one games and then lists games dot keys plus one game Ducky's negative one plus one equals board eighty I also ran out of input ran on input by subjects not you ready server offline what does that mean it's what I've got in CMD David that means that like you received a bytes object it did an unpick 'el and then the server offline so just like something happened with the server there I know the issue but it's kind of hard to like explain how that works we're getting this this issue with bo2 saying local variable Bo reference for assignment which means that the try/except up here wasn't working properly so Bo goos games if not spec okay Pio goes games game that should just always work if that doesn't then we should just quit the threaded client um pickled Dada was truncated pickled Dada was truncated you shouldn't be getting pickled data truncated I really tried so hard to fix that issue okay let's try this again okay let's send more data I don't think it's a timeout anymore I used to think it was the timeout let's receive this times eight so we don't get truncated pickled Dada anymore and let's see if the server runs a bit better now if we get multiple games going so say for game and game about keys there's nothing I won't do anything obviously so if G equals negative one games list games dog keys negative 1 which is the n plus one he was bored eight eight and then just say me equals madness so gee who's that and then G hates anyone who's new if you guys want to try this out I'm just having some issues getting a server running properly probably go for like another hour something we'll see you know how this works number of connections number of games equals the land of games that should be correct actually should delete game when you leave I almost want to max it to for connections and just say don't accept the connect in case so I'm gonna max the four connections or now I'm gonna say if connections is less than four otherwise break and we'll see it like I'll slowly increment what do you do it I'll slowly increment the amount of games that we have and then you know we'll see how this goes so we'll start with four and then we'll go up from there okay so let me go server yes okay let's run this now invalid syntax yep really okay yeah no server doc hi actually I don't want to edit it like that spend it here server it up high so equal isn't equal equals such a silly mistake that's fine I better fix that in here too so I forget if G equals equals negative one run that no run that okay connections first for people get in the game go list index out of range new fix one second this is actually easy fix I can't believe I didn't think of that um try because there's obviously gonna be no games so you have to create a new one except game 0 equals board so say G is zero games equals board okay try that now this is so stressful because usually I can just test it on my own computer and then like if it doesn't work it's just an issue for me but you guys are all like trying to connect constantly so we like I can get as frustrating for you guys especially because you're just trying to help me out ah all right I gotta be fast yeah otherwise I'm not even gonna get in the game get game Tim server offline if address already in use that that's an issue H top whoever's told me to do it concurrently um that's it that's a problem for another day what is this network manager thing doing I don't know what that's doing I don't think I have any more Python processes running should be at the top if they are oh people just like instantly connect server offline oh I'm not even gonna get in connection reset by Pierre let's see this Tim your block their turn okay what happened here it just stopped running oh my god I'm an idiot so what I did oh no this is that yeah don't do that yeah that's just yeah I essentially made it so once a hits for connection service stops running I don't you don't want that uh me Gayle fishing was ok it was kind of cold but you know it was alright connection reset can actually set it can actually reset connection number of connections three number of connections I want to reach for connections and then that way we can just like chill Johnny left game one come on Johnny Tim your block there turn all right for connections if no one leaves then you should be okay we should see if this works FIFA lover I'm doing good man how are you doing alright come on man let's go Zinberg it's your turn if you don't go see what I'm gonna have to quit okay there we go alright I'm gonna play a casual game of chess if you guys have any questions you just want to chat ask me anything feel free in the chat if you have any tips what I like if this works with four games then we've kind of fixed some of the stuff oh he's going Queen out alright I'm waiting to see if it tells me that I left 'game okay so let's go like hmm I also like very bad at chess so this is gonna be an interesting game I want to protect that pawn you guys have any chest tips here help me out please it's an it is cheating but you know it's fun okay ooh it's going for the pawn oh damn it now he's gonna take that takes the take that to go that um okay so this game is working I don't know what like everything else is having I'm gonna get my music going quickly here you're still watching yes I am knew he's gonna take that this guy's killing me right now this is your old chess game this is my old chess game this is my old chess game faithful lover I wasn't connected when it said I disconnected Oh God this is just okay this game is working though like I'm playing a nice game of chess against this guy although he's absolutely like mopping the floor with me but I mean other than that nice civil game also guys I'm working on this really cool machine learning model it's uh it's a chat bot that talks like me I've got it like kind of working like there's so much more I need to do with it but like it's really it's pretty exciting so if you guys are excited about that let me know I'm planning like what I'm doing is I trained it off all my previous iMessage history and I got all my responses like any given text and I forgot that you can go diagonal oh my god this guy's killing me um I Jesus can't go there do this sorry I got distracted off train it off all my iMessage history and then um what did I do from there sure we got the like responses based on what I've said oh my god this guy's killing I can't focus when I'm getting destroyed in chests now he's gonna take my rook isn't he let's see and right now I'm just working on the model that essentially can like take any string of text and give you a response that sounds like me but it's pretty interesting it's actually like I don't know he's kind of blowing my mind how it actually works I've been following like a few tutorials online on how to figure it out this this video will be saved so you guys can look at it it's kind of just been a mess I've just been trying to figure stuff out and get people connected a few people I think we're playing games but I don't really know I don't know if someone else is playing a game currently I don't know if that's happening all I know is I'm getting killed in this game of chess and it just not is not going great I really wanted to try castling but then he kind of ruined my approach on that alright we got a piece there now he's gonna take it with the rook looks like that one black mirror episode yeah it works okay so his in bars playing against me yeah so I don't know you guys were all saying it wasn't working but as soon as I start playing it works for me and it's nothing to do with my network so I don't know hmm it's coming in a bit of a pickle right here is not really much way to catch up could you guys would think I'd be good at chess but I'm really it's just I'm really just not I'm definitely gonna play around with the server stuff I've seen it done foreign python so thanks man no worries got ya the end of the day you know if it doesn't work you can just steal the code I have on github it's completely opensource right and try to mess with it there what is he going for here Oh Zen bar left the game I don't know if he left or or not if we ran into an issue so yeah that's a question okay guys try to connect see if you can get your games running I'm gonna bump the games up to like six I think so that more people can connect so I'm gonna quit that now and then yeah let's just we'll keep bumping up and see if we get this working properly six I feel like I should be printing out like what game it's putting you in what game it's not putting in but again we don't really not that advanced here um okay so let's go server yes how old do you Tim I'm 18 guys I do really apologize to a lot of you guys I appreciate the help and everyone's joining in and trying to mess with this I think it's kind of fun but I mean like it's also kind of annoying because you want it I want to get working a little bit better but at the end of the day um I'm not left the game oh great so you had block it's their turn I'm playing against player I don't know whoever that is he must not know type 2 naman Oh connection reset player non left the game player hey Tim left the game left the game left the game hmm I'm gonna try castle because I haven't done that yet that'll be our test currently add a listener for an input let's see oh great he knows I'm trying to Castle cuz he's listening to what I'm saying maybe that other way I remember reading somewhere like the rules of chess like in your opening you never want to move the same piece twice or something like that and I've just violated that rule a bunch of times man really you're not gonna let me Castle I just want to test my castling let's do that so now I'm kind of screwed because he has all these pieces advanced up the board but you know I don't this would be good if I was actually like a decent chess player other player left so again I don't oh there's something I got an error that popped up there let's read that err I mean I'm gonna run this with IDL II and try to play and see like what errors I get one if I disconnect an invalid argument was supplied oh I'm not running server sir why am i running server one run game no edit with ideally five Tim let's get this PI game window open all right waiting for player let's see the next person to successfully connect to the server is going to be yeah was early planning on making this stream like go for a long time if I was I would I trot like attempt to fix all these issues obviously but again I just don't really know like what is going on there's issues on the server side there's issues on the client side just a lot of stuff and apparently okay now I'm in so I'm playing at Blue Jay then playing against this guy like the whole time I just want to have this ideally window open so I can actually see what the air is when when I get one so I'm just gonna keep testing this will keep going just kind of play with it um what else you guys saying here all right I'm so bad at chess I don't know have any idea what made us to actually make if you guys haven't seen my other livestream by the way I did what was it like a 12 hour coding one where actually went for 12 hours this time and I did the tower defense game so that one's cool okay so ran outta input bytes objects has so much we already failed server offline ran Oh to input that is actually a easier fix okay so we can fix that one ran out of input so if you guys we're getting ran out of input as like a main issue I can fix that actually what is ran out of input err Python what is that getting this I would check the file is not empty first most of the answers here I've dealt with how to manage EOF error exceptions which is really handy if you're unsure but whether the pickled object is empty or not however if you're surprised pickle if I was empty okay so the pickle file is empty that it's sending to me which means it wouldn't have been dumped from the server properly or it just like didn't receive anything from the server so it was empty when I was opening it okay let's try to mess with that server okay connection closed they'll print e.honda send all send data it goes pickled dumb Bo okay is that always happening if not d break so it should just be dumping this this pic object every time but I guess if Bo isn't defined but it should be so I don't know why that would be it so in the client error here pickled out loads reply let's try to make this eight yeah I don't know why that's doing that I don't know why I'm getting that except socket air as II trying to apply pickles ran out of input hmm where was I looking at up okay let's see pickle ran on input easy solutions to prefix each message with the length the problem with your code is that receive when you cease to be saga my return different amounts of data from what you might have expect and their slice type packet boundaries so the easy solution is prefect each message then for receiving okay for receiving everything the server sends until it closes its side of the connection try this socket dot send all okay and then start server at address so yeah I don't know why I'm getting that issue you guys were saying you were getting that issue a lot um yeah I don't know that's it I wonder earn you guys playing right now says something says some games ago I player Jake left game one game one ended I think the game aspect is working but I think what just happening is it's it's just crashing on on this the clientside so I think I've honestly figured out because I don't get these like these happen to once in a while but that's not I don't know that's expected so I think what I need to do now is just mess with the clientside and see if there's a way that it you know it could keep trying rather than just doing this this issue here so we'll send that same data we'll just say like wow should we try it like I just want to set a timer essentially okay so let's import time this is gonna require that you guys read download this after so I'll tell you that after that's probably an issue to you guys are using like different versions of everything okay anyways we'll print E and I will say try or say start time this time that time we'll say Wow time that time start others where time is less than and we'll do well give it like a 10second doing this a long time we'll give it a five second time out so it waits five seconds to try to get another response if it doesn't get one in that time it will just break um so then what we'll do is just keep trying to do this so we'll keep if pick okay let's try this keep trying this so I could just do like a Wow let's put the whole thing in a while with whatever I'm trying to do here let's just put it in a while loop with it this time then start time while true and we'll say if reply okay so if we get here then we just break this wallet if we get to the point where we can return reply then break say well I'll just return anyway so we don't even need to break it'll just keep trying it but we need to do that time aspect let's do the hot so say time time start underscore time okay I don't know if there's any way that I can block people from joining because I want to just try it on my end and see if this works okay I'm gonna stop that connection um Python equals Java they are both to me the same know Python Java are very different okay I first update a few things I think I'm just gonna just throw this code other player left so what's that exception where it says like failed Oh failed just means it it broke that while loop skipper to that try accept and screen break print exception where else is this break sometimes printer please type your name no I can't do that okay so I'm gonna upload this code to github you guys gonna have to read download it I'm gonna change the server here to what it is on my computer now I got to deal with all these different versions just a master cap you read that go to github let's go code update files so once I changed water client and game server as well okay everyone go to the github redownload this code I just updated some stuff I don't like who knows is it gonna work I have no idea we'll see and try that okay we're gonna we're gonna mess with that now and see if we can get that going I just put in the chat too because that was gonna happen sooner I'm waiting for all these connections now to come in so this is let's see this if you try to connect with the other one it still might work but again okay I'm gonna have to update the code on github again I'm I've apologized I should tested this first Tim sir offline what's the issue started connection new connection what's you get says you guys are in though Tim but I can't join server offline why is that happening games you ended number connections one actually reset or any this it's not working is it guys I don't know what the hell what the heck is happening there's nothing I don't think anything is happening on server I think it's just literally not oh the reply might be oh yeah I know what I did wrong oh god okay let's go to network client up I just everyone's like it's broken its broken okay let's see um well time that time is less than five I apologize go redownload again guys I changed it that's yeah that's yeah oh my god okay i'ma modify that when I mind now ideally I dis just yeah that would be why I wasn't working I was like why the heck is this going now it should work uh what's running the wrong thing you're gonna have to go download again guys from the thing I apologize see this still not working oh my god I don't know what the issue is edit with ideally server offline okay let's try this yeah I pulled just for all the mistakes yeah I don't know this is kind of fun to mess around with it but like this is breaking when it shouldn't be actually sleeping and break okay if Ronnie befall Bo equals connect so it's gotta be something here that's messing up print okay I'm just gonna turn the server offline so I don't mess with you guys anymore let's see what this issue is server oh well now the servers actually offline so that's gonna be the issue okay let's try this one more time try this Tim server offline so it's just printing oh I'm not ready Tim let's go this float object is not callable what did I do here subline um float object is not callable that's gonna be in here somewhere that I did this mess son float object is not call well I don't even know where that is time time okay okay where is my github yeah I think I'm gonna go for like another 40 minutes we'll see like we'll get ups like two hours because I am determined to try to fix this and then we'll see alright redownload again guys I'm typing it in the chat because I know it's something you won't see it I'm having silly syntax errors I should test this before I upload it to github I know I'm an idiot but it's fun let's run this now and what this one's probably gonna work either I'm just like going out at each time let's see oh there we go we're in ok so I fix something again I have no idea if this is gonna do anything we have no but you guys you need you need to redownload otherwise it's just gonna kick you every time you try to go in you just hop you got to redownload it otherwise it's not gonna work where's my pie game window my pie game thing shut down I don't know what happened to it run this again main game Tim so I got in ok you're a block so someone's on right now I guess we'll see if someone moves how does Tim type and talk yeah it's an interesting question what is that issue getting some some air here I don't know what it is though I gotta wait for someone else to build successfully connect slow mode maybe no I don't need snow mode it's fine my turn okay so far so good Oh bites at your object has no actually ran out of input ran on input by jumping to actually time one okay so that means it didn't unpick lit um okay sub line bytes object has no attribute time one which would probably be mean that I didn't unpick alit so reply equals pickled loads and I'm returning reply which would just be this because something didn't happen there oh I can't return reply unless we make it over this loop so only if we get to here are we good so because that should be the end of the wallet I only want to break if this works properly break I got Rando to input thing I'm running on a bun yeah no okay that's let's fix this uh I just got to modify this client file inside live stream thank you guys again for the feedback does really help a lot and let's go can't change that and commit changes what is it case someone was complaining why is this on this playlist it's gonna one I haven't heard yet rockabyebaby comes on in the playlist I know great selling right ok let's run that ivory up I've updated it just like it yes you gonna have to keep downloading it is B if you have the git command you could just keep pulling it it'll be easy but Tim waited for player alright my turn an established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine by itself guys know what ready established connection was how do you know not minecraft is your host machine but not minecraft Python I've just finished watching the tower defense fit how do you like it man using some Frank no I'm using no framework i coded this from scratch which is probably why it's not working and established and remover suffer heroes machine let's see what the issue is here timeout or the never network connection died firewall see do we think it could be a firewall issue timeout to other network network connection dot firewall close the connection because it was open too long connection was closed before process has been finished there's not really a framework it just like I don't know solution disable antivirus disable firewall okay so which it could be an issue with that but I never had any issue before with that hmm let's see so that was the issue that was like run into object has not recovered all right well that's a new issue just there's just a lot you know the funny thing is like this works for like two people I just don't even work for a law so I assume it's just an issue with like it can't handle all these people and I just haven't coated in a way to handle these people socket air and establish connection I should really maybe open like a new socket after a certain amount of people connect why do I keep getting air output this pipe air occurs server responds to requests and the client has already closed the connection browsers do that sometimes finite usage you can ignore this web okay so that means like I want to make sure this client the client doesn't close the connection on himself so where is do I would even close this I'm gonna disconnect here anywhere well time time current II reply equals pickle uploads hmm people that load should load that into an object no I don't need to like cast it or something hmm Piccolo's ply said bytes object has no attribute which means it didn't get loaded in which means when I returned reply would have returned that not that okay who it should really just keep calling until it returns all right we'll do a time out we'll do a longer time out maybe less than ten I don't want to just keep like spamming the error message though invalid load key eight pickle data was truncated I don't know what the heck that error is some guy keeps keeps naming himself hi Tim Tim you really should save your name I should have done that all right let's try this we need to watch that console output oh oh okay I moved it was just lagging I guess so connection was reset means that some like from the clientside it reset the connection which I have no idea how to fix that this game seems to be working smoothly raisa say that's probably in a crash but we'll see see established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine yeah that's established can I don't know to fix that that's the issue Python sockets okay I'm gonna keep going out this for a little bit cuz I can fix that and I might be able to get against you guys but I don't know what we've seen the ER flask okay when running tests to install an established connection I could bump that connection timeout but it shouldn't be a connection issue on hmm you try to reconnect now cuz then it has to start nuke this is a very complicated issue take your time you don't need to be stressed or anything I'm not stressed I just want a little bit stressed but I won't figure this out and it's just frustrating because I had it working so well for two games and then as soon as I went to maybe server blocks the realtime sockets because a lot of requests at the same time I'm gonna send an email to the guys that on my server I'm just gonna post on my other tab and just see if I can get them to respond because maybe there's a firewall on there that's blocking that so let's see if that's the issue so I gotta go to again big shout it to cherry servers they hooked me up with this server it's not definitely not their fault that's not working it's probably mine um like two cherry servers are you guys still trying to connect let me know if you guys are working or not I like you guys get in a game I think in that it just crashes like there's a timeout or something on the server but it does work like the game works everything that's functional it's just that it's just the server issue right so put that down oh man you guys got kicked again I'm mister I'm just on my other monitor right now guys just working developing a game is very hard it can be fixed at once and it can't be fixed at once oh yeah for sure I know you mean that I do think that firewall might be issue let's see here I'm just logging into the cherry server here and getting these guys see if they can help me out I don't know if there's a way to like disable the firewall on my server we'll see though let me we'll get it the hosts load on it too and see if it's like going crazy yeah says it can handle 3 gigabits per second bandwidth or that's what it has your bandwidth so this should be fine networking hmm so I'm talking to Zack right now Adam cherry servers and we'll see if he gets back to me we can see what's happening here player as our left game but I didn't connect really what how does it have why would that be happening okay no it's because the thread that didn't end when you guys leave sometimes the thread actually doesn't end oh that can be an issue you I'm hey Tim by the way oh so some hey Tim there should not be any firewall and server by default just running some here let me put this on my other tab here okay so apparently is no firewall in the server so that's not the issue and you guys are saying that you're seeing your names in the console which is how do I see okay let's try this which is like kind of blowing my mind too so that means that the threads aren't stopping so we gotta fix that so thread try break print exception has eat break because I would kick you so we'll just break okay so let's try that now on the server side you know and that wind SB I'm hatin Oh the king of mystery will it make sense because your name is the king of mystery all right let's try this again and go No everyone go try to connect so now I'm starting to think maybe it's an issue I'm like that who knows at this point someone connected let's go to desktop chess game game I will play against you all right there turn hey Tim's time fifteen Tim's time all right see this works ah we left establish connection was aborted by the software in your host machine like I don't know what the heck that means maybe I need to disable firewall if I disable firewall and this works it's probably a bad idea to do this but let's see the main firewall off let's try it out I don't leave that off for long but let's see if this works now hey Tim is back in once again oh alright let's see no issues yet I don't know why I did that I'm just literally randomly moving pieces because I already know that it's just gonna break at some point let's go Nathan you missed quite a bit my friend game one ended connection reset by Peter okay oh dude to Castle that's not how you do it if you wanted to Castle you got to do castle and then hit King but I can't do it because you moved the dude oh so it wasn't the firewall that was the issue let's turn that back on yeah so that's just not the issue okay so go to client no might have to do another part time where I try to do this I really wanted to get a bunch of people going on he was working at first like kinda but then not really strange everyone is called player none yeah I don't know why this called player none I don't know why it's Nathan if you guys see your names and you not connecting then like let me know but who knows so yeah I think threaded clients friends exception II connection reset by peers so it's happening on the client side that it's just disconnecting oh I should probably change the socket timeout on the client side too cuz I down the server side to be oh wait did I don't have that I swear I added like Oh cuz I just brought it back to my other server alright let's see here um okay change socket default time outs this is like the last wind if this doesn't work then we I don't want to give up but we might have to socket dot set default timeout so I'm gonna try this on mine set as a tensecond timeout and then we'll try it on this as well so socket dot set default timeout that's ten seconds I know that sounds long but in chess it's like slow glee anyways so that's probably not that important I would you want to try another Network game like this okay so I got a push I got I'm gonna have to reset this chess game server yes waiting for connections okay game Tim all right waiting for player should get him here there we go okay you are white my turn Oh ran out of input 51 what the heck is that invalid load key I know it doesn't it's literally it's yeah it's weird PLC invalid load pickle the air you get is a standard error yet when the network gets with wrong file format what causes the error what the heck most common pickles to pickle everything with a single dump to a file but then you have to load everything at once with a single load however if you open a file here and it'll do multiple dump calls then your load will mirror that your open we're trying to achieve okay it'll be relevant I had some a problem when the pickle archive had been created using gzip compressed pickle archive has been like this try to open it throws errors but if the pickle is open gzip all is harmonious hmm unpicking err unbowed load key I don't know what that means try to unpick 'el something that had not originally been pickled yeah I know what truncated is I know I fixed like that one's a pretty easy fix but it just this one is kind of weird okay so reply Oh pickle dot loads am I ever sending anything back that's not what did this client used to look like now I don't have the old version of oh I do have the old version of client I can look at that chess game and it was ideal Eve yeah this game is built on Python whoever asked that pic equals okay if pick something like that send people the thumbs ok reply the only thing this should receive is pickled Dada though so wonder if I'm ever sending any downa back that's not pickles self declined a sentence during not encode data applying was something I'd receive if I was people download your ploy turn play let's see this pickle download reply ok so I don't know how I'm getting that error now that I've added this timeout so I don't know if I need this like timeout thing anymore let's get rid of this I know I could've just shifttab this but you know we didn't do that so let's get rid of the hots so try this now and let's open this with ideally such a scheme game oh we don't need break anymore them okay let's edit this break you guys I said you guys I love how you guys are still trying to connect just the persistency I love it um okay let's try this game I feel like he was working better at the beginning then I mess with all this stuff and now who knows alright someone join should I use Python as hacking purpose I don't know man I'm just waiting for someone to connect so I can play against someone alright my chain Oh player Tim left game let's see what is our issue here why did that dinosaur ideally Tim you just instantly disconnects now so that's interesting where's my freaking thing server offline service not off on there just oh my gosh other player left holy crap router the input ran out of input menu screen missing one required potential argument name Oh gonna fix that okay bytes object has actually ready ran out of input ran out of input so it's something with the sending yeah I don't know man I am NOT a Python developer no well I mean I don't know what do you consider a Python developer I do a lot of development with Python but I don't have a job as a Python developer ran out of input data stream to go thumbs Bo which is the board client pickle dot loads fly I don't know guys don't know what is going on here it's sending back the board it's now we're getting an issue here we're like we're like all menu screen button menu screen win name could fix that okay let's just dress again it's like you need some break no breaks what I break I'm just gonna get off this to be honest I still haven't even eaten dinner yet so I got to do that probably go for another few minutes see how this works Tim all right load that up I don't know why that doesn't come to the forefront unpicking stack on unpicking stack underflow that's a new one let's try this one I think now it's time to read maybe you're gonna restart the server I don't know I haven't restarted the server in a while try that address already in you so I closed it too quick and this oh my god it doesn't okay under pickling understand a flourish and pickling under flow here this is what this when pickle ends unexpectedly here self to request to receive your seemingly 12 bytes max you pick a large must be longer than 12 bytes so gets cut off I would not recommend to handling TCP sockets directly unless you're very familiar with networking and you need highperformance justing HTTP to wrap your messages in using HTTP library if you do have to be able T to be directly of two choices you can agree on a terminal string when you up this code is on github guys console gave me air 32 broken pipe oh my god alright so it's just a socket error listen process could not create a dedicated process to handle the client requests the error is caused by a resource exhaustion issue either with the OS or within the Oracle Oh God socket air air 32 broken pipe also the following may need to be changed ok so I just gotta find a better way to send large pickle over socket okay hmm socket our byte stream so ideally to write your protocol read this this is a bass amp without protocol should be careful but buffer receive oh yeah because okay so pickle a file over socket IO bytes IO what does that do hmm so the way that I'm sending this data is just like bad that's that's that's the issue python pickle pickling over socket I don't want to read all that Pikul the loads case how do you get size of pic Madonna why would the sink a happy birthday it's interesting pickled data Python since the size of serialized pickle of knowledge can be quite different from the size of the object in memory we should probably persist 5 bytes how to get byte size of pickled out in Python okay I'm just gonna try this again run f5 Tim playing against Johnny right now I don't know who Johnny is but let's see if if we can get a game going other player left pickle data was truncated by table because not she ready all right guys so it's almost been two hours how long has it been actually and we're not really getting anywhere here I'm gonna look at this and see what I can do with the sending of data I think that all I really need to figure out and I you guys have obviously helped me realize this is um that the the way this data is sending is just not it's just not good I need a better way to send this data so well not send receive the data sending it is actually fine I need a better way to receive it on the the client and a better way to send it from the server and so if I just sit down and focus on this like half an hour she probably figured out but I am gonna end the stream now big thank you to everyone who joined again another thank you to cherry servers for hooking me up with that server definitely not their fault that this isn't working I just probably you know messed something up and I really do appreciate everyone helping me out on this I had a good time chatting with you guys and do this unfortunately I couldn't get it to work but you know sometimes that's how it goes and now I'm gonna learn from the mistakes and hopefully be able to fix this and do something better in the next time you guys have any other ideas for streams or more stuff that you want to see definitely let me know I really enjoy doing these streams and like if I can do some more shorter ones that are only like 2 hours long that fits my time schedule kind of a little bit better cuz the last ones I did were like 2 3 4 like no what am I saying they were like 12 and 18 hours long so yeah anyways guys once again thank you gonna hop off the stream now and I definitely will if you guys subscribe to the channel you guys will know when I do more streams and all that kind of fun stuff so see you guys later
