00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to
00:02 - another youtube video
00:03 - so in this video i'm going to share with
00:05 - you the 10 most popular programming
00:07 - languages
00:08 - and what they're used for now i've taken
00:10 - these rankings from github
00:11 - based on the most popular pull request
00:13 - languages in quarter 2
00:15 - of 2020 so ideally this will give us the
00:18 - best idea of the current most popular
00:20 - programming languages
00:21 - but of course you can argue these
00:23 - rankings and i'm sure that the rankings
00:24 - of these languages will change
00:26 - as we go through the year anyways with
00:28 - that being said let's go ahead
00:30 - and get started
00:34 - [Music]
00:39 - as no surprise coming in at spot number
00:42 - one we have
00:43 - javascript now javascript is an
00:45 - extremely popular programming language
00:47 - that is used everywhere on the web
00:49 - now although javascript can be used as a
00:51 - server-side programming language with
00:53 - tools like node.js
00:54 - it is commonly run client-side within a
00:56 - web browser now this enables javascript
00:58 - to be one of the most versatile
01:00 - languages when it comes to building
01:01 - interactive front-end user interfaces
01:04 - any modern website you visit uses a ton
01:06 - of javascript to make the website
01:08 - interactive
01:09 - and any dialogue form or animation you
01:11 - see is likely being controlled by
01:13 - javascript
01:14 - and now with the popularity of front-end
01:16 - frameworks like vujs
01:18 - react and angular it is not surprising
01:20 - that javascript tops this list
01:22 - now as a final thought it's worth noting
01:24 - that javascript is dynamically typed
01:26 - and although it can be used for many
01:27 - other applications they're typically
01:29 - much better choices and at number 2 we
01:32 - have my personal favorite programming
01:34 - language which is
01:35 - python now python is a general purpose
01:37 - programming language
01:38 - meaning it has a much wider use case
01:40 - than something like javascript now it is
01:42 - heavily used in server-side applications
01:45 - ethical and i guess non-ethical hacking
01:47 - data science machine learning
01:49 - artificial intelligence scientific
01:51 - computing and general scripting tasks
01:53 - now python is known to be easy to learn
01:56 - easy to read and easy to write so this
01:58 - makes it great for smaller projects and
02:00 - the tasks that i listed above
02:02 - but its main disadvantage comes from its
02:04 - lack of speed and the fact that it is
02:06 - dynamically typed now just like
02:08 - javascript this makes it difficult to
02:10 - maintain
02:11 - in large scale projects so python has
02:13 - also been used in millions of
02:15 - applications around the world
02:17 - some of them are instagram youtube
02:19 - dropbox it was actually used by nasa in
02:22 - their integrated planning system
02:23 - and was even responsible for the ai in
02:25 - the game civilization 4.
02:28 - so python is usually capable of
02:29 - accomplishing most programming tasks
02:32 - but oftentimes there are far better
02:33 - choices they may be less versatile but
02:36 - they will be better at that specific
02:37 - task
02:38 - and we will see that as we get through
02:39 - the rest of this list
02:42 - moving on to java so java is known for
02:45 - being a dying programming language but
02:47 - it's actually still
02:48 - quite widely used and comes into our
02:50 - list at number three
02:51 - now java is another general purpose
02:53 - language that is well suited for game
02:55 - and mobile app development
02:57 - enterprise level applications and also
02:59 - building web apps
03:00 - now java is a statically typed language
03:02 - it is compiled
03:04 - and although it may be frustrating to
03:05 - write in it provides many advantages in
03:07 - terms of structure and code
03:09 - maintainability that you won't get in
03:11 - say python and javascript
03:13 - now so in those popular applications
03:14 - that use java are of course minecraft
03:16 - the adobe creative suite and most
03:18 - general android applications
03:20 - now as i said java is the core for
03:22 - android mobile app development
03:24 - and although languages like kotlin now
03:26 - exists it is still used
03:28 - very heavily over 3 billion devices run
03:31 - java and it follows the wora principle
03:34 - which is right once
03:35 - run anywhere so once you've compiled
03:37 - your java code it can run on any device
03:39 - that runs java
03:40 - and to summarize all of this java
03:42 - actually is
03:43 - not that bad of a programming language
03:45 - and i would definitely recommend
03:46 - learning it now go otherwise known as
03:49 - golang
03:50 - is number four on this list and is a
03:52 - fairly new and widely used programming
03:54 - language
03:54 - goaling emerged as an alternative to c
03:56 - plus plus and java for the app
03:58 - developers at google and was actually
04:00 - created by two google employees and
04:01 - released in 2012.
04:03 - now go is a robust system level language
04:06 - typically used on the server side for
04:08 - large-scale distributed systems
04:10 - go is designed around concurrency and is
04:12 - extremely performance heavy
04:14 - go is used across millions of google
04:16 - servers and is the back end of some
04:18 - popular websites
04:19 - like dropbox now golang also has python
04:22 - like syntax and has performance
04:24 - similar to c plus now this makes it its
04:27 - main advantage and how quickly you can
04:29 - develop with it while still maintaining
04:31 - high performance now i personally am a
04:33 - huge fan of go and would encourage
04:35 - anyone especially any of you that know
04:37 - python to look into it because it's a
04:39 - really interesting language and
04:41 - something to add to your tool belt
04:44 - and at number five we have c plus plus
04:48 - so c plus plus is the industry standard
04:50 - for aaa games and is used extensively to
04:52 - develop 3d applications
04:54 - operating systems browsers compilers and
04:57 - other
04:58 - countless performance dependent
04:59 - applications now c plus plus is
05:01 - extremely fast and has a somewhat unique
05:03 - ability to interface with the user's
05:05 - hardware
05:06 - giving it much more control on a lower
05:08 - level so imagine like
05:09 - talking to a graphics card now c plus
05:11 - plus is known for being a difficult
05:13 - language to learn
05:14 - and write in and is not recommended for
05:16 - beginners
05:17 - generally speaking you should have a
05:18 - good reason to use c plus plus when
05:20 - there are often easier and faster
05:22 - options to develop with now it's worth
05:24 - noting that c
05:25 - plus plus is also used on the web but
05:27 - typically you'll see it more in embedded
05:28 - systems and performance concerned
05:30 - applications like i've mentioned
05:32 - now some examples of c plus it's used in
05:34 - the apple os
05:35 - it's part of microsoft windows it's used
05:38 - in database software like mysql and of
05:40 - course almost
05:41 - all your aaa 3d games use c plus plus
05:45 - and moving on to number six we have
05:48 - typescript
05:49 - now typescript is another newish
05:51 - programming language that was actually
05:52 - developed at microsoft
05:54 - and happens to be a superset of
05:56 - javascript so this means almost
05:58 - everything you know about javascript is
05:59 - transferable to typescript with a few
06:02 - minor exceptions
06:03 - now typescript is as it reads a
06:05 - statically typed language
06:07 - that actually transpiles into native
06:09 - javascript so all your typescript code
06:11 - actually gets transpiled or compiled
06:13 - whatever you want to call it
06:14 - into javascript before it runs now the
06:16 - reason why it exists is actually to make
06:19 - developers lives easier by providing
06:21 - interfaces
06:22 - modules optional static typing better
06:24 - code navigation
06:25 - error detection and just a ton of other
06:27 - things that help with maintainability
06:29 - readability and all those things that
06:30 - i've mentioned
06:31 - now typescript is used in replacement or
06:33 - conjunction with javascript to provide a
06:36 - better development experience
06:37 - so while working at microsoft this
06:39 - summer i actually wrote a bunch of code
06:40 - for the python extension in vs code
06:43 - using solely typescript so i highly
06:45 - recommend all javascript developers
06:47 - check out typescript
06:48 - it won't take you long to learn and it's
06:50 - definitely worth it
06:51 - and number seven brings us to ruby now
06:54 - ruby is a general purpose programming
06:56 - language pretty similar to python
06:58 - is also dynamically typed object
07:00 - oriented it is a general
07:02 - purpose scripting language and it can be
07:03 - used for many different applications but
07:06 - obviously its most popular
07:07 - implementation is rails
07:09 - otherwise known as ruby on rails which
07:10 - is used to design web
07:12 - applications now ruby is considered to
07:14 - be more elegant than python
07:16 - in terms of web development and is used
07:17 - on popular sites like shopify
07:19 - github airbnb fiverr and many more it is
07:23 - fast
07:23 - adheres to very strict standards and
07:25 - those standards make it easier to learn
07:27 - and generally makes the code much more
07:29 - clear when you're reading through it
07:31 - and at number eight we have everybody's
07:34 - favorite programming language which is
07:35 - php
07:36 - now php is a general purpose scripting
07:38 - language that is especially well suited
07:40 - to server-side web development
07:42 - so it usually runs on a web server and
07:44 - php is known
07:45 - as an old dying language and there are
07:48 - many alternatives to it now that are
07:50 - typically recommended for new
07:51 - development
07:52 - that being said many developers still
07:54 - must know and be able to write in php
07:57 - and that is because it is used all over
07:59 - the web mostly in older code bases
08:02 - now to give you some examples facebook
08:04 - yahoo and wikipedia
08:05 - were originally developed in php and
08:08 - wordpress actually uses a ton of php
08:10 - today
08:11 - so there's a few specific cases where
08:12 - you may want to use php
08:14 - but personally i wouldn't recommend
08:16 - anyone learn it or even use it
08:17 - unless you have a very good reason to do
08:20 - so
08:21 - and at number nine we have c sharp now c
08:24 - sharp is extremely versatile and can be
08:26 - used to make pretty much
08:27 - anything that said it is particularly
08:29 - well suited for building windows-based
08:31 - applications
08:32 - and games it is also commonly used to
08:34 - build web applications
08:36 - and recently has become more popular in
08:38 - mobile app development
08:39 - now i'm sure many of you are familiar
08:41 - with the game development engine called
08:42 - unity this uses c-sharp to design and
08:45 - create games
08:46 - so like other languages on this list
08:48 - c-sharp is maintained by microsoft
08:50 - and is continuing to grow year over year
08:52 - one of the core advantages of c-sharp is
08:54 - how massive its library is
08:56 - uh providing you with higher level
08:58 - functionality compared to languages say
09:00 - like java or c-plus plus
09:02 - although this language is not as popular
09:03 - as some of the other languages on this
09:05 - list
09:05 - c-sharp is a great language to learn and
09:08 - is still demanded heavily in the
09:10 - programming industry
09:12 - now last but definitely not least we
09:14 - have
09:15 - c now c is by far the most important
09:18 - programming language on this list
09:19 - and is responsible for the existence of
09:21 - many of the tools and languages we use
09:23 - every single day
09:25 - now c is the core of almost all
09:26 - operating systems micro controllers
09:28 - embedded systems and a lot of enterprise
09:31 - level applications
09:32 - c is extremely flexible and versatile
09:34 - and allows control over low-level
09:36 - components and hardware
09:37 - that is not found in many higher level
09:39 - programming languages
09:40 - especially a lot of the other ones on
09:42 - this list now many experienced
09:44 - developers highly recommend learning c
09:46 - as it teaches you many fundamental
09:48 - programming concepts that will carry
09:50 - over to a lot of other programming
09:52 - languages
09:53 - c excels at memory management and fast
09:55 - and efficient execution of code
09:57 - and all that said c is extremely
09:59 - difficult to learn
10:00 - it is not necessary for many developers
10:03 - but it's definitely something that will
10:04 - be worth it if you can get into it and
10:06 - learn about a lot of the lower level
10:07 - concepts
10:08 - last thing i'll say here because i know
10:10 - you guys will ask about these languages
10:12 - rust came in at 13 on this list swift
10:15 - was at 14.
10:16 - kotlin was 15 dart was 16 and objective
10:20 - c was 17.
10:21 - i will link these resources down below
10:23 - so you can have a look
10:24 - but that has been it for the 10 most
10:26 - popular programming languages and what
10:28 - they're used for
10:29 - if you guys enjoyed please do make sure
10:31 - you leave a like subscribe to the
10:32 - channel and let me know down below
10:34 - what is your favorite programming
10:36 - language on this list

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back to another youtube video so in this video i'm going to share with you the 10 most popular programming languages and what they're used for now i've taken these rankings from github based on the most popular pull request languages in quarter 2 of 2020 so ideally this will give us the best idea of the current most popular programming languages but of course you can argue these rankings and i'm sure that the rankings of these languages will change as we go through the year anyways with that being said let's go ahead and get started as no surprise coming in at spot number one we have javascript now javascript is an extremely popular programming language that is used everywhere on the web now although javascript can be used as a serverside programming language with tools like node.js it is commonly run clientside within a web browser now this enables javascript to be one of the most versatile languages when it comes to building interactive frontend user interfaces any modern website you visit uses a ton of javascript to make the website interactive and any dialogue form or animation you see is likely being controlled by javascript and now with the popularity of frontend frameworks like vujs react and angular it is not surprising that javascript tops this list now as a final thought it's worth noting that javascript is dynamically typed and although it can be used for many other applications they're typically much better choices and at number 2 we have my personal favorite programming language which is python now python is a general purpose programming language meaning it has a much wider use case than something like javascript now it is heavily used in serverside applications ethical and i guess nonethical hacking data science machine learning artificial intelligence scientific computing and general scripting tasks now python is known to be easy to learn easy to read and easy to write so this makes it great for smaller projects and the tasks that i listed above but its main disadvantage comes from its lack of speed and the fact that it is dynamically typed now just like javascript this makes it difficult to maintain in large scale projects so python has also been used in millions of applications around the world some of them are instagram youtube dropbox it was actually used by nasa in their integrated planning

versatile but they will be better at that specific task and we will see that as we get through the rest of this list moving on to java so java is known for being a dying programming language but it's
