00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - in today's video I'm gonna be talking
00:03 - about mining and more specifically
00:05 - mining aetherium so today we're just
00:08 - gonna go through the very basics on how
00:10 - to actually start mining and I'm just
00:12 - gonna explain a little bit of what
00:13 - mining is right now before we get
00:15 - started so pretty much what mining is is
00:18 - using computational power so using
00:20 - graphics cards it's more specifically in
00:22 - your computer to secure transactions so
00:26 - whenever a transaction is sent on the
00:28 - blockchain which is how aetherium works
00:30 - it's built on the blockchain all of
00:33 - those transactions go through a bunch of
00:34 - different computers where they then
00:36 - secure that transaction and they are
00:38 - given a very small reward for doing so
00:41 - so just like a fee at a bank that's the
00:44 - same thing that you're getting on your
00:45 - computer for doing amount of work okay
00:48 - so that's really basics of how mining
00:50 - works I'm not gonna explain exactly how
00:52 - to do that if you want to see that go
00:54 - look up another video where I'll make
00:56 - another one on my channel another day
00:57 - okay so the first thing we need to do
00:59 - when we have to start mining is we have
01:01 - to make sure we have the right hardware
01:03 - so pretty much any computer will work as
01:05 - long as it has a graphics card or
01:08 - multiple graphics cards that have 4
01:11 - gigabytes or more of video RAM so for
01:14 - example the 1050 Ti has 4 gigabytes of
01:17 - video RAM so that will work the RX 480
01:19 - has 8 gigabytes of video RAM that will
01:22 - work anything that has less than that so
01:23 - if you have a three gigabyte card that
01:25 - will not work for mining ok so now that
01:29 - we've got that over with let's download
01:31 - our miners so what we're gonna actually
01:32 - have to do if we're mining and we're
01:34 - just starting out we don't have a huge
01:35 - factory yet of mining rings we're gonna
01:38 - have to mind with a pool so if you mind
01:40 - with a pool that means you're gonna get
01:41 - more and more transactions going through
01:44 - your computer and the only downfall of
01:46 - mining with a pool is that they actually
01:48 - take a 1% fee but really that's not that
01:51 - much you can see the 1% fee is here it's
01:54 - a lot faster than doing it alone so
01:56 - you're gonna want to mind with a pool ok
01:58 - so how to connect we're just gonna
01:59 - scroll down this page it's on ether mine
02:01 - org I'm gonna leave that in the
02:03 - description there's a lot of different
02:05 - pools you can use if you want but this
02:06 - is the one I'm gonna be doing a tutorial
02:07 - and is this one that I use personally ok
02:10 - so now we're gonna look for claymores
02:12 - miner
02:13 - this miner works with AMD cards and
02:15 - NVIDIA cards and that's why I use it
02:16 - because I have a combination of both so
02:19 - this one also will work if you have two
02:21 - AMD cards two Nvidia cards whatever this
02:23 - is the one that most people use okay so
02:26 - we're just gonna go to this windows link
02:29 - right here it says Bitcoin talk thread
02:31 - now my Internet's quite slow so actually
02:32 - already have the link opened up here and
02:34 - now you're gonna see this huge thing
02:36 - features whatever all you want to look
02:38 - for is Google right here or mega either
02:40 - way that you want to download it I
02:41 - personally just go with Google you click
02:43 - on that link and it should bring you to
02:45 - a page that looks like this and it is a
02:47 - shared Google Drive right here that has
02:50 - all the different versions of Claim
02:52 - worst miner so all you're gonna do is
02:54 - you can click on one and then you're
02:56 - gonna go up here and you're gonna click
02:58 - on the download button now obviously I
03:00 - already have it downloaded so I'm not
03:02 - gonna do that but you just pick whatever
03:03 - version you want and then download it
03:05 - try to look for the most recent one okay
03:08 - now that we've done that we can put this
03:09 - aside and we should have our miner
03:12 - so you're gonna get a folder that has a
03:14 - bunch of different things and it's gonna
03:15 - be this exact name it's gonna say
03:17 - claymores dual aetherium minor I
03:19 - personally I just renamed it to minor
03:21 - because it looks cleaner on my desktop
03:23 - okay so now that you've done that you
03:25 - want to open it up and now inside you're
03:28 - gonna see a bunch of different stuff and
03:29 - there is something we need to do here so
03:32 - we actually need to create a new text
03:34 - file so we're gonna go new and then text
03:37 - document now I just like to name this
03:40 - ether mine or start or go so in this
03:43 - case I'm just going to name it go
03:44 - doesn't really matter what you name it
03:45 - as long as it's different from
03:46 - everything else in the folder so I'm
03:47 - just gonna name it go then I'm gonna
03:49 - click Edit it's gonna load us up into
03:53 - the text document here and now we're
03:55 - gonna refer back to the first website we
03:57 - were on ether mind don't work now
04:00 - underneath claymores here there is a
04:02 - white box that has all this different
04:04 - stuff here you don't have to worry about
04:06 - what any of this means
04:07 - all you have to do is copy it like that
04:09 - so ctrl C and paste it into your text
04:12 - document now the last line is what we're
04:15 - gonna be associating ourselves with in
04:16 - just a minute so for right now we're
04:18 - just gonna save and we're gonna move
04:20 - over and create an aetherium wallet so
04:22 - if you do not already have an aetherium
04:24 - wallet you need to follow these steps in
04:26 - making one
04:26 - if you do just fast forward the video a
04:28 - little bit and you'll see when we're
04:30 - using our aetherium wallet okay so I
04:33 - personally like to use a website called
04:35 - my ether wallet comm I'm gonna put that
04:37 - link in the description again you can
04:39 - use any etherium wallet you want any
04:40 - etherion website however you like to do
04:43 - it but this is the version and the
04:45 - website that I use personally so what we
04:47 - need to do is we need to create a new
04:48 - wallet so we're right here it says new
04:50 - wallet just make sure that's selected
04:51 - and now we're gonna create a password
04:53 - obviously you want to make sure this is
04:54 - very secure as this gonna encrypt you
04:56 - one of your files that you need to use
04:58 - to open your wallet so in this case I'm
05:00 - gonna do the most secure password I know
05:02 - one two three four five six seven eight
05:03 - because I already have a wallet so
05:05 - doesn't matter alright we're gonna
05:07 - create our new wallet oh it has to be at
05:09 - least nine characters okay there we go
05:11 - one two three four five six seven eight
05:13 - nine now what you're gonna want to do is
05:15 - you're gonna want to download this
05:16 - keystore file so make sure you keep this
05:19 - safe I'm gonna click it right now to
05:22 - download to show you make sure you keep
05:24 - it on multiple devices so maybe a laptop
05:27 - and your desktop or you have an offline
05:28 - location like a USB Drive because you do
05:31 - need that to access your wallet now your
05:33 - private key same thing with this you're
05:35 - gonna want to copy this and put it in a
05:36 - text document I don't really need this
05:38 - because I'm not actually gonna use this
05:40 - wallet but this is another way that you
05:41 - can access your wallet okay so save that
05:44 - and then move on so now if you want to
05:46 - unlock your wallet you can use the
05:48 - keystore file that you just downloaded
05:50 - so from your downloads if I can find my
05:53 - downloads and you have to type in the
05:55 - password alright like that and then you
06:00 - should be able to unlock your wallet and
06:02 - see your balance okay so that's it
06:04 - that's all I'm going to show you for
06:05 - your wallet
06:06 - now what you need to do is you need to
06:08 - actually take your private key so just
06:11 - if you scroll down after opening up your
06:13 - wallet there's something that says your
06:15 - address so sorry not your private key
06:17 - this is your public key is what it's
06:19 - known as you're just gonna copy this to
06:20 - your clipboard is we're gonna need to
06:22 - use this for the next step so this is
06:25 - actually what you can send all your
06:26 - aetherium to so this is how the miner is
06:30 - gonna recognize you and how you're gonna
06:31 - be sent aetherium okay so copy that and
06:35 - then we're gonna go back to that notepad
06:38 - that we made I hope you didn't close it
06:40 - yeah
06:40 - so right here we can see in these
06:43 - greater-than signs and less than signs
06:45 - it says your aetherium address so
06:48 - obviously our address is what we just
06:49 - copied so what we're gonna do is we're
06:51 - gonna paste it right in there and we can
06:53 - get rid of the greater than and less
06:55 - than signs okay and now your rig name so
07:00 - you can call this whatever you want the
07:03 - only reason they have this is for people
07:04 - that have multiple rigs so they can know
07:06 - if one goes offline if one is online and
07:08 - so on so in this case I'm just gonna
07:09 - call mine bedroom because guess where my
07:12 - computer's all right and now the last
07:15 - step is choosing what pool we want to go
07:18 - with so this is our pool right here but
07:21 - there is different pools within this
07:22 - pool at different servers right here so
07:25 - there is us-1 us-2
07:27 - EU and then Asia one so according to
07:31 - where you live you're gonna choose the
07:33 - appropriate one so in this case I live
07:35 - in Canada but the closest one to me
07:36 - would be US one so I'm gonna use u.s.
07:40 - one now the numbers at the end here
07:43 - indicate which one is the correct like
07:48 - key that you need to put in kind of I
07:50 - don't know how to exactly know how to
07:51 - explain it I just pick one of these
07:53 - numbers so for us one you can use either
07:55 - one four four four four or four four
07:58 - four four in this case we're just gonna
08:00 - stick with what we have here so four
08:02 - four four four actually you know what
08:03 - we'll put the one there just because all
08:07 - right and then if you're using Asia you
08:08 - can use the other ones like this okay so
08:11 - here it says you either mind or all
08:13 - right now all we need to do is we need
08:16 - to change the file extension here so
08:17 - that this runs as a batch file so we
08:20 - need to do is we do file save as and now
08:23 - you're gonna change this save type to
08:26 - all files and you're going to do instead
08:28 - of go dot text you're gonna do go dot
08:30 - bat so that stands for batch file and
08:33 - you're just gonna save it in the same
08:35 - directory as where your miner folder was
08:37 - so where you made that text document
08:39 - okay so we go ahead we've saved that so
08:42 - now all we need to do to start mining is
08:44 - we actually need to find that file so go
08:46 - to about and double click it now you can
08:49 - see it loads up a bunch of different
08:50 - text here it's going to be slow
08:52 - especially the first time you run
08:54 - of configuring some files so just let it
08:55 - run so here it's detected my two
08:57 - graphics cards that's good if it doesn't
09:00 - do that you can have to play around with
09:03 - some of the settings you've got going on
09:04 - your computer to make sure that that
09:06 - happens now it's creating the buffer so
09:09 - we're just going to wait a second to see
09:11 - when it starts mining
09:13 - okay so just give it a minute just
09:15 - creating all these buffers this does
09:17 - take a minute or two and while we're
09:19 - doing that we can actually go to the
09:23 - ether mind website to get ready to see
09:25 - if our miner is actually working now
09:27 - this is a good website you can use to
09:29 - track your miners progress say you're
09:31 - out and you want to make sure that your
09:33 - miner is still online it's still running
09:35 - you can do so from that website so what
09:38 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just paste my
09:41 - address into the address thing up here
09:44 - and click enter like so uh now I'm gonna
09:49 - click accept and close and you can see
09:50 - obviously nothing is running right now
09:52 - because I haven't started running now
09:54 - there you go you can see that we've
09:56 - loaded up here and we see the speed so
09:58 - our mega hashes per second for each of
10:00 - the GPUs like so now I'm just gonna
10:03 - close mine because I am recording a
10:04 - video right now so I want to make sure
10:07 - that the frames stay okay now when you
10:10 - do that you should be able to see in a
10:12 - few minutes so it does take a minute or
10:14 - two once your miners running you'll hear
10:16 - the fans on your GPUs run up and then
10:18 - once you've punched in your address here
10:20 - you should
10:20 - if by refreshing the page be able to see
10:23 - the hash rate come up and the active
10:25 - workers and then down here it'll give
10:26 - you a bunch of graphs and it'll tell you
10:29 - all your workers and your estimated
10:31 - payout so if you go to payouts and
10:33 - rounds you can see how much your
10:34 - estimated to make per month obviously
10:36 - it's zero right now because my minor is
10:38 - not run and yeah that's pretty much it
10:41 - for how to mine aetherium

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about mining and more specifically mining aetherium so today we're just gonna go through the very basics on how to actually start mining and I'm just gonna explain a little bit of what mining is right now before we get started so pretty much what mining is is using computational power so using graphics cards it's more specifically in your computer to secure transactions so whenever a transaction is sent on the blockchain which is how aetherium works it's built on the blockchain all of those transactions go through a bunch of different computers where they then secure that transaction and they are given a very small reward for doing so so just like a fee at a bank that's the same thing that you're getting on your computer for doing amount of work okay so that's really basics of how mining works I'm not gonna explain exactly how to do that if you want to see that go look up another video where I'll make another one on my channel another day okay so the first thing we need to do when we have to start mining is we have to make sure we have the right hardware so pretty much any computer will work as long as it has a graphics card or multiple graphics cards that have 4 gigabytes or more of video RAM so for example the 1050 Ti has 4 gigabytes of video RAM so that will work the RX 480 has 8 gigabytes of video RAM that will work anything that has less than that so if you have a three gigabyte card that will not work for mining ok so now that we've got that over with let's download our miners so what we're gonna actually have to do if we're mining and we're just starting out we don't have a huge factory yet of mining rings we're gonna have to mind with a pool so if you mind with a pool that means you're gonna get more and more transactions going through your computer and the only downfall of mining with a pool is that they actually take a 1% fee but really that's not that much you can see the 1% fee is here it's a lot faster than doing it alone so you're gonna want to mind with a pool ok so how to connect we're just gonna scroll down this page it's on ether mine org I'm gonna leave that in the description there's a lot of different pools you can use if you want but this is the one I'm gonna be doing a tutorial and is this one that I use personally ok so now we're gonna look for claymores miner this miner works with AMD cards and NVIDIA cards and that's why I use it because I have a combination of both so this one also will work if you have two AMD cards two Nvidia cards whatever this is the one that most people use okay so we're just gonna go to this windows link right here it says Bitcoin talk thread now my Internet's quite slow so actually already have the link opened up here and now you're gonna see this huge thing features whatever all you want to look for is Google right here or mega either way that you want to download it I personally just go with Google you click on that link and it should bring you to a page that looks like this and it is a shared Google Drive right here that has all the different versions of Claim worst miner so all you're gonna do is you can click on one and then you're gonna go up here and you're gonna click on the download button now obviously I already have it downloaded so I'm not gonna do that but you just pick whatever version you want and then download it try to look for the most recent one okay now that we've done that we can put this aside and we should have our miner so you're gonna get a folder that has a bunch of different things and it's gonna be this exact name it's gonna say claymores dual aetherium minor I personally I just renamed it to minor because it looks cleaner on my desktop okay so now that you've done that you want to open it up and now inside you're gonna see a bunch of different stuff and there is something we need to do here so we actually need to create a new text file so we're gonna go new and then text document now I just like to name this ether mine or start or go so in this case I'm just going to name it go doesn't really matter what you name it as long as it's different from everything else in the folder so I'm just gonna name it go then I'm gonna click Edit it's gonna load us up into the text document here and now we're gonna refer back to the first website we were on ether mind don't work now underneath claymores here there is a white box that has all this different stuff here you don't have to worry about what any of this means all you have to do is copy it like that so ctrl C and paste it into your text document now the last line is what we're gonna be associating ourselves with in just a minute so for right now we're just gonna save and we're gonna move over and create an aetherium wallet so if you do not already have an aetherium wallet you need to follow these steps in making one if you do just fast forward the video a little bit and you'll see when we're using our aetherium wallet okay so I personally like to use a website called my ether wallet comm I'm gonna put that link in the description again you can use any etherium wallet you want any etherion website however you like to do it but this is the version and the website that I use personally so what we need to do is we need to create a new wallet so we're right here it says new wallet just make sure that's selected and now we're gonna create a password obviously you want to make sure this is very secure as this gonna encrypt you one of your files that you need to use to open your wallet so in this case I'm gonna do the most secure password I know one two three four five six seven eight because I already have a wallet so doesn't matter alright we're gonna create our new wallet oh it has to be at least nine characters okay there we go one two three four five six seven eight nine now what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to download this keystore file so make sure you keep this safe I'm gonna click it right now to download to show you make sure you keep it on multiple devices so maybe a laptop and your desktop or you have an offline location like a USB Drive because you do need that to access your wallet now your private key same thing with this you're gonna want to copy this and put it in a text document I don't really need this because I'm not actually gonna use this wallet but this is another way that you can access your wallet okay so save that and then move on so now if you want to unlock your wallet you can use the keystore file that you just downloaded so from your downloads if I can find my downloads and you have to type in the password alright like that and then you should be able to unlock your wallet and see your balance okay so that's it that's all I'm going to show you for your wallet now what you need to do is you need to actually take your private key so just if you scroll down after opening up your wallet there's something that says your address so sorry not your private key this is your public key is what it's known as you're just gonna copy this to your clipboard is we're gonna need to use this for the next step so this is actually what you can send all your aetherium to so this is how the miner is gonna recognize you and how you're gonna be sent aetherium okay so copy that and then we're gonna go back to that notepad that we made I hope you didn't close it yeah so right here we can see in these greaterthan signs and less than signs it says your aetherium address so obviously our address is what we just copied so what we're gonna do is we're gonna paste it right in there and we can get rid of the greater than and less than signs okay and now your rig name so you can call this whatever you want the only reason they have this is for people that have multiple rigs so they can know if one goes offline if one is online and so on so in this case I'm just gonna call mine bedroom because guess where my computer's all right and now the last step is choosing what pool we want to go with so this is our pool right here but there is different pools within this pool at different servers right here so there is us1 us2 EU and then Asia one so according to where you live you're gonna choose the appropriate one so in this case I live in Canada but the closest one to me would be US one so I'm gonna use u.s. one now the numbers at the end here indicate which one is the correct like key that you need to put in kind of I don't know how to exactly know how to explain it I just pick one of these numbers so for us one you can use either one four four four four or four four four four in this case we're just gonna stick with what we have here so four four four four actually you know what we'll put the one there just because all right and then if you're using Asia you can use the other ones like this okay so here it says you either mind or all right now all we need to do is we need to change the file extension here so that this runs as a batch file so we need to do is we do file save as and now you're gonna change this save type to all files and you're going to do instead of go dot text you're gonna do go dot bat so that stands for batch file and you're just gonna save it in the same directory as where your miner folder was so where you made that text document okay so we go ahead we've saved that so now all we need to do to start mining is we actually need to find that file so go to about and double click it now you can see it loads up a bunch of different text here it's going to be slow especially the first time you run of configuring some files so just let it run so here it's detected my two graphics cards that's good if it doesn't do that you can have to play around with some of the settings you've got going on your computer to make sure that that happens now it's creating the buffer so we're just going to wait a second to see when it starts

your estimated to make per month obviously it's zero right now because my minor is not run and yeah that's pretty much it for how to mine aetherium
