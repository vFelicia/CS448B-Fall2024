00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:03 - this video we're going to be doing is
00:04 - talking about the menu aspect of
00:06 - ordering our pizza so if you weren't
00:08 - here in the last video I'd recommend you
00:10 - go back and watch that first as I kind
00:11 - of explained how we work with this API
00:13 - what an API is what we're actually doing
00:16 - here and you know what are all these
00:17 - lines of code because if you just read
00:19 - this this isn't gonna make any sense and
00:20 - there is no documentation online
00:22 - explaining what this is you kind of just
00:24 - have to figure it out which is what we
00:25 - did in the last video anyways before we
00:27 - get too far I do need to mention the
00:29 - sponsor of this series which is kite
00:30 - another Matthew massive thank you to
00:32 - them there will be a link in the
00:33 - description if you'd like to download
00:35 - kites and kite is definitely gonna save
00:37 - us a lot of time in this series by
00:39 - allowing us to kind of see the
00:40 - documentation from all these different
00:42 - modules that we've been exploring before
00:44 - as some Auto completions while we're
00:46 - typing and you guys will see that and
00:48 - I'll point that out as we go through
00:49 - these series okay so without further ado
00:51 - let's get started and let's look at the
00:53 - menu for our store so we've already
00:54 - found the store by using this line of
00:56 - code here so we're gonna go through the
00:57 - next part of the quick start here and
01:00 - just actually get a menu from our store
01:02 - so what we did here was we create a
01:05 - customer object found the closest store
01:07 - the customer printed out that store now
01:09 - what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna
01:10 - print a blank line like that and I'm
01:13 - also just gonna print menu backslash N
01:15 - and we'll do backslash n like this so we
01:19 - just get a little bit nice nicer
01:21 - formatting when we do this so what I'm
01:23 - going to do now is define my menu object
01:26 - so menu equals my local Domino's get
01:29 - menu and I'm gonna use the menu to
01:31 - search for a specific item and the name
01:34 - that I want to search for in this case
01:36 - it's just gonna be Coke so we're gonna
01:39 - look to see what you know items on the
01:41 - menu have Coke involved in them and then
01:43 - we'll print those out and have a look at
01:45 - them so let's look at this now if we
01:47 - just go here and run this oops not cos I
01:50 - want to run that code give it a second
01:52 - and we can see that it loads up the
01:54 - store and then it loads on that menu the
01:56 - prices and the different items for
01:58 - whatever thing of coke it is so in this
02:00 - case you know 500 milliliters coke
02:01 - that's 177 and obviously these prices
02:04 - will be in the currency of whatever
02:06 - country you're searching in so either
02:07 - United States or Canada and yeah that is
02:10 - pretty much how that
02:11 - works okay so now we kind of know how to
02:13 - work with this menu right so what we've
02:15 - done is you know we got the menu and we
02:17 - know to search this is pretty
02:18 - straightforward I'm sure none of you are
02:19 - confused so what I want to do now is
02:21 - actually write a function that's going
02:22 - to allowed the user to search for items
02:24 - on the menu so right now if we wanted to
02:26 - search for something we had to have that
02:28 - line of code which was you know dot
02:29 - search then we manually typed in the
02:31 - name but obviously that's like not very
02:33 - good if someone actually wants to use a
02:34 - program and we will be writing a program
02:36 - that essentially allows the user to do
02:37 - everything without having to you know
02:39 - come in here at hard code stuff so let's
02:41 - get started though you know by doing
02:43 - this with the menu allowing the user to
02:44 - query it and then we'll move into some
02:45 - more advanced stuff later on so what I'm
02:47 - gonna do is I'm gonna say define search
02:50 - menu like this and what we're gonna do
02:53 - is just take some menu object now in
02:55 - here what I'm gonna do is get the user
02:58 - to type in some item that they want to
02:59 - search for show them the results and
03:01 - then you know ask them do you want to
03:02 - search again are you done searching they
03:04 - say yes they can type another item and
03:06 - so on so the first thing we need to do
03:08 - is get what the users going to search
03:10 - for so we need to start by printing say
03:12 - you know you are now searching the menu
03:16 - or something
03:17 - you are now searching the menu dot dot
03:21 - type an item to look for we do something
03:24 - like that so print type an item to look
03:31 - for a colon and this needs to be an
03:33 - input and then what we're gonna do
03:35 - before this is just say item equals
03:38 - input and I'm just gonna do something
03:40 - here which is dot strip which is gonna
03:41 - remove any leading or trailing white
03:43 - spaces and then I'm gonna put this to
03:45 - dot lower so this is just gonna take
03:47 - whatever they type in and make it all
03:48 - lowercase now what I'm gonna do is
03:50 - capitalize the first letter of this
03:52 - string the reason I'm gonna do that is
03:54 - because when we search for something we
03:57 - need to have like the capitals it's kind
03:59 - of weird the way this API works if you
04:01 - have lower cases and you search for
04:03 - something it's not gonna find the item
04:05 - if it has a capital if that makes any
04:06 - sense like for example if I tried to
04:09 - search for coke but all the items had
04:11 - Coke like this
04:12 - this isn't gonna match so we need to
04:13 - make sure that we have capitals on
04:15 - whatever item that we're looking for so
04:17 - we need to correct this so to do that
04:19 - the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm
04:21 - going to say if item so essentially that
04:24 - means
04:25 - it's not a blank string so say if item
04:27 - does not equal some blank string means
04:29 - they actually type something then we
04:31 - will turn this into an upper case so to
04:33 - do that we're gonna say item equals item
04:36 - 0 dot upper + item :
04:43 - like this - the answer : 1 to the end
04:45 - what this is going to do is recreate the
04:47 - item string such that the first
04:50 - character of item is going to be an
04:52 - upper case and the rest of that is going
04:53 - to be whatever the rest of the string is
04:55 - now this should work for us but actually
04:58 - to even make this little bit safer we'll
04:59 - say and the Len of item like this is
05:05 - greater than 1 so essentially if we have
05:07 - two characters in the item that we're
05:09 - searching for then this will work
05:11 - otherwise what we'll do is we'll give
05:12 - some error message saying for them to
05:14 - try again and we're gonna put this all
05:15 - in a while loop in a second but just
05:16 - bear with me then we're gonna say print
05:20 - invalid and actually what we'll do is
05:22 - we'll say exiting search so if they
05:25 - insert some invalid string we'll just
05:27 - get out of the search so what I'm gonna
05:29 - do now is put all this in a while loop
05:30 - so I'm gonna say well true like that and
05:33 - we'll do all this and then inside this
05:35 - else I'm going to break and below here
05:38 - now if we have a valid item we haven't
05:41 - broke it out it wasn't invalid we'll
05:42 - search for that item and display so
05:45 - we'll just say print results for : and
05:51 - then we can actually just format this
05:52 - using an F string so inside of here I'm
05:55 - gonna put F before my quotation marks
05:56 - inside of here I'm gonna put item which
05:59 - is gonna be the item that they search
06:00 - for and then we will simply search that
06:03 - item so say menu dot search and in here
06:07 - item and that should be good to go so
06:10 - now what I'm gonna do is call this
06:12 - function like this so search menu and
06:14 - again notice kite is giving us these
06:16 - completions which is saving us some time
06:18 - and this should actually be good to go
06:20 - so essentially what we've done is you
06:22 - know we've got the closest store of the
06:23 - customer we printed out that store we've
06:25 - now just printed you know menu we're
06:27 - gonna get whatever this menu object is
06:29 - we're going to need to pass that into
06:32 - our function like this when we search
06:33 - the menu we'll do that and then what
06:36 - this search menu function is gonna do is
06:37 - say
06:38 - you are now searching the menu while
06:39 - true so essentially until we get some
06:41 - invalid input we're gonna keep asking
06:43 - them to look for some item we're gonna
06:44 - strip off the white spaces we're gonna
06:46 - put everything to lowercase then what
06:48 - we're gonna do is say so long as the
06:49 - item is not a blank string which
06:51 - actually I can omit that and I can just
06:52 - say if the Len of the item is greater
06:54 - than one so there's more than one
06:55 - character in there then what we'll do is
06:57 - say item equals item zero which will be
06:59 - the first character to uppercase plus
07:01 - item 1 : to the end which essentially
07:04 - means all the other characters in there
07:06 - will combine that together into one
07:07 - string if that's not true so if this
07:09 - condition isn't true will say that's
07:10 - invalid and will break otherwise we'll
07:12 - look for the results for that item and
07:14 - print them out so let's have a look at
07:16 - how this works if I made any mistakes or
07:17 - not which I likely did so python
07:19 - tutorial pie so manual says you are now
07:21 - searching the menu type an item to look
07:23 - for what should we look for let's look
07:25 - for a pizza and search takes one
07:27 - positional argument but two were given
07:29 - Oh interesting sorry we just need to do
07:32 - name equals item my apologies here guys
07:34 - so do that make sure that is a bug so
07:37 - let's do this one more time
07:38 - and you are now search an item let's
07:40 - look for pizza and wow look how many
07:43 - pizzas we get showing up and you know
07:45 - what we can search for another item so
07:46 - let's look for sprites see if there's
07:50 - anything there and it gives us some
07:51 - answers for sprite and this is how we
07:53 - can search and query the menu so that's
07:55 - the first step we've done I think I'm
07:56 - actually going to end the video at this
07:59 - and in the next video what we're gonna
08:00 - do is think about how we can get the
08:02 - customer information to come in so how
08:04 - can we write something like that and
08:05 - then once we have all of these items how
08:08 - can we get the user to select specific
08:10 - items and how can we add that to an
08:12 - order so that we can eventually place
08:14 - that and get the credit card information
08:15 - so you can see there's a lot of steps to
08:16 - go here but this is kind of what we're
08:18 - gonna be doing in this series building
08:19 - some of these functions that can do this
08:21 - for us and working our way towards a
08:23 - program where a user can actually order
08:24 - a pizza from their command line so with
08:26 - that being said if you guys enjoyed make
08:27 - sure you leave a like subscribe to the
08:29 - channel and I will see you guys in the
08:30 - next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video we're going to be doing is talking about the menu aspect of ordering our pizza so if you weren't here in the last video I'd recommend you go back and watch that first as I kind of explained how we work with this API what an API is what we're actually doing here and you know what are all these lines of code because if you just read this this isn't gonna make any sense and there is no documentation online explaining what this is you kind of just have to figure it out which is what we did in the last video anyways before we get too far I do need to mention the sponsor of this series which is kite another Matthew massive thank you to them there will be a link in the description if you'd like to download kites and kite is definitely gonna save us a lot of time in this series by allowing us to kind of see the documentation from all these different modules that we've been exploring before as some Auto completions while we're typing and you guys will see that and I'll point that out as we go through these series okay so without further ado let's get started and let's look at the menu for our store so we've already found the store by
