00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the second video
00:02 - in the neural network tutorial series
00:04 - now in today's video what we're gonna be
00:06 - doing is actually getting our hands
00:07 - dirty and working with a bit of code and
00:09 - loading in our first data set so we're
00:11 - not actually gonna do anything with the
00:12 - model right now we're gonna do that in
00:14 - the next video this video is gonna be
00:15 - dedicated to understanding data the
00:17 - importance of data how we can scale that
00:20 - data look at it and understand how
00:22 - that's going to affect our model when
00:24 - training the most important part of
00:26 - machine learning at least in my opinion
00:28 - is the data and it's also one of the
00:30 - hardest things to actually get done
00:31 - correctly training the model and testing
00:34 - the model and using it is actually very
00:36 - easy and you guys will see that as we go
00:37 - through but getting the right
00:39 - information to our model and having it
00:41 - in the correct form is something that is
00:43 - way more challenging than it may seem
00:45 - with these initial data sets that we're
00:47 - gonna work with things are gonna be very
00:49 - easy because the data sets are gonna be
00:50 - given to us but when we move on into
00:52 - future videos to using our own data
00:54 - we're gonna have to pre-process it we're
00:56 - gonna have to put it in its correct form
00:57 - we're gonna have to send it into an
00:59 - array I'm gonna have to make sure that
01:00 - the data makes sense that we're not
01:02 - adding things that shouldn't be there or
01:04 - we're not omitting things that need to
01:05 - be there so anyways I'm just gonna
01:07 - quickly say here that I am kind of
01:09 - working off of this tensorflow 2.0
01:11 - tutorial that is on tensorflow website
01:14 - now I'm kind of gonna stray from it
01:16 - quite a bit to be honest but I'm just
01:18 - using the data sets that they have and a
01:20 - little bit of the code that they have
01:21 - here because it's a very nice
01:23 - introduction to machine learning and
01:25 - neural networks but there's a lot of
01:26 - stuff in here that they don't talk about
01:28 - and it's not very in-depth so that's
01:30 - what I'm can I get to be adding and the
01:31 - reason why maybe you'd want to watch my
01:33 - version of this as opposed to just
01:35 - reading this off the website because if
01:36 - you have no experience with neural
01:38 - networks it is kind of confusing some of
01:40 - the stuff they do here and they don't
01:41 - really talk about why they use certain
01:44 - things or whatnot so anyways the data
01:46 - set we're gonna be working with today is
01:47 - known as the fashion m-miss data set so
01:50 - you may have heard of the old does so
01:52 - which is image image classification but
01:55 - it was like digits so like you had
01:56 - digits from 0 to 9 and the neural
01:59 - network about classified digits this
02:01 - one's a very similar principle except
02:02 - we're gonna be doing it with like
02:03 - t-shirts and pants and what do you call
02:07 - it sandals and all that so these are
02:08 - kind of some examples what the images
02:10 - look like and we'll be showing them as
02:11 - well
02:12 - in
02:13 - the code so that's enough about it I
02:15 - felt like I should tell you guys that
02:16 - the first thing that we're gonna be
02:18 - doing before we can actually start
02:20 - working with tensor flow is we obviously
02:21 - need to install it now actually maybe
02:23 - I'll grab the install command here so
02:25 - I'll have to copy it but this is the
02:27 - install command for tensor flow 2.0 so
02:30 - I'm just gonna copy here link will be in
02:31 - the description as well as on my website
02:33 - and you can see pink pip install - Q
02:36 - tensor flow equals equals 2.0 point OH -
02:39 - alpha zero now I already have this
02:41 - installed but I'm gonna go ahead and hit
02:42 - enter anyways and the - Q I believe just
02:46 - means don't give any output when you're
02:47 - installing so if this runs and you don't
02:50 - see any output whatsoever then you have
02:52 - successfully installed tensorflow 2.0
02:54 - now I ran into an issue where I couldn't
02:56 - install it because I had a previous
02:58 - version of numpy installed in my system
03:00 - so if for some reason this doesn't work
03:02 - and there's something with numpy I would
03:04 - just PIP uninstall numpy and reinstall
03:07 - so do pip uninstall numpy like that I'm
03:10 - always not gonna run that but if you did
03:12 - that and then you tried to reinstall
03:14 - town flow 2.0 that should work for you
03:16 - and it should actually install its own
03:17 - version of the most updated version of
03:19 - numpy now another thing we're going to
03:21 - install here is going to be matplotlib
03:24 - now matplotlib is a nice library for
03:27 - just graphing and showing images and
03:29 - different information that we'll use a
03:31 - lot through this series so let's install
03:32 - that I already have it installed but go
03:34 - ahead and do that and then finally we
03:36 - will install pandas which we may be
03:39 - using in later videos in the series so I
03:42 - figured we might as well install it now
03:43 - so pip install pandas and once you've
03:45 - done that you should be ready to
03:46 - actually go here and start getting our
03:49 - data loaded in and looking at the data
03:51 - so I'm just gonna be working on sub line
03:54 - text and executing my Python files from
03:56 - the command line just because this is
03:58 - something that will work for everyone no
04:00 - matter what but feel free to work in
04:01 - ideally feel for you to work in pi tram
04:03 - as long as you understand how to set up
04:05 - your environment so that you have the
04:07 - necessary packages like tensorflow and
04:09 - all that then you should be good to go
04:11 - so let's start by importing tensorflow
04:14 - so import tensorflow as TF like that I
04:17 - don't know why it always short forms
04:20 - when I try to do this but anyways we're
04:22 - gonna import or actually sorry from
04:24 - tensorflow
04:26 - will import Kara's now Kara's is an API
04:30 - for tensorflow which essentially just
04:32 - allows us to write less code it does a
04:35 - lot of stuff for us like you'll see when
04:37 - we set up the model we use Kara's and
04:39 - it'll be really nice and simple and just
04:41 - like a high-level API and that's the way
04:43 - that they describe it that makes things
04:44 - a lot easier for people like us that
04:46 - aren't going to be defining our own
04:47 - tensors and writing our own code from
04:50 - scratch essentially now another thing we
04:53 - need to import is numpy so we're gonna
04:54 - say import if I could get this here
04:58 - import numpy as NP and finally we will
05:02 - import matplotlib so mat plot lib in
05:07 - this case dot pie plot as p ot and this
05:11 - again is just going to allow us to graph
05:12 - some things here all right so now what
05:14 - we're gonna do is we're actually gonna
05:15 - get our data set loaded in so the way
05:17 - that we can load in our data set is
05:19 - using care ass so to do this I'm just
05:21 - gonna say data equals in this case
05:22 - Kara's dot data sets dot fashion
05:26 - underscore m-miss and this is just the
05:30 - name of the data set there's a bunch of
05:31 - other data sets inside of Kara's that we
05:33 - will be using in the future now whenever
05:36 - we have data it's very important that we
05:39 - split our data into testing and training
05:41 - data now you may have heard this you
05:44 - talked about this in the previous
05:45 - Michigan learning tutorials I did but
05:47 - essentially what you want to do with any
05:49 - kind of machine learning algorithm
05:50 - especially a neural network is you don't
05:52 - want to pass all of your data into the
05:54 - network when you train it you want to
05:56 - pass about 90 80% of your data to the
06:00 - network to train it and then you want to
06:01 - test the network for accuracy and making
06:04 - sure that it works properly on the rest
06:06 - of your data that it hasn't seen yet
06:08 - now the reason you'd want to do this and
06:10 - a lot of people would say why don't I
06:11 - just give all my dad's the network could
06:13 - it make it better not necessarily and
06:15 - that's because if you test your data on
06:18 - if you test your network on data it's
06:20 - already seen then you can't be sure that
06:24 - it's not just simply memorizing the data
06:25 - it's seen right for example if you show
06:27 - me five images and then like you tell me
06:30 - the classes of all of them and then you
06:32 - show me that the same image again you
06:34 - say what's the class and I get it right
06:35 - well did I get it right because I
06:37 - figured out how to analyze the images
06:39 - properly or because
06:40 - I'd already seen it and I knew what it
06:42 - was right I just memorized what it was
06:44 - so that's something we want to try to
06:45 - avoid with our models so whenever we
06:47 - have our data we're gonna split it up
06:48 - into testing and training data and
06:50 - that's what we're gonna do right here so
06:52 - to do this I'm gonna say train in this
06:54 - case train underscore images and train
06:57 - understory labels combi in this case
07:01 - test underscore images comma test
07:04 - underscore and labels and then we say
07:07 - this is equal to data dot get underscore
07:10 - data so not get low done we're done now
07:13 - the reason we can do this is just
07:15 - because this load data method is gonna
07:16 - return information in a way where we can
07:18 - kind of split it up like this in most
07:20 - cases when you're writing your own
07:21 - models for your own data you're gonna
07:23 - have to write your own arrays and for
07:25 - loops and load and data and do all this
07:27 - fancy stuff but Chara's makes it nice
07:29 - and easy for us just by allowing us to
07:31 - write this line here which will get us
07:32 - our training and testing data in the for
07:35 - kind of variables that we need so
07:38 - quickly let me talk about what labels
07:40 - are now so for this specific data set
07:42 - there are 10 labels that means each
07:44 - image that we have will have a specific
07:46 - label assigned to it now if I actually
07:49 - I'll show you by just printing out if I
07:51 - print for example train underscore
07:53 - labels and let's just print like the 0
07:55 - if I guess the first training label so
07:58 - let me just run this file so python
08:00 - tutorial 1 you can see that we simply
08:04 - get the number 9 now this is just what
08:08 - is represent like the label
08:10 - representation so obviously it's not
08:11 - giving us a string but let's say if I
08:13 - pick for example 6 and I hit enter here
08:16 - you can see that the label is 7 so the
08:19 - labels are between 0 & 9 so 10 labels in
08:23 - total now the thing is that's not very
08:25 - useful to us because we don't really
08:26 - know what label 0 is will label 9 is so
08:29 - what I'm gonna do is create a list that
08:31 - will actually define what those labels
08:33 - are so I'm gonna have to copy it from
08:36 - here because I actually don't remember
08:37 - the labels but you can see it says here
08:39 - what they are so for example label 0 is
08:42 - a t-shirt label 1 is a trouser 9 is an
08:45 - ankle boot and you can see what they all
08:47 - are so we just need to define exactly
08:48 - this list here so class names so that we
08:51 - can simply take whatever value is
08:53 - turn to us from the model of what label
08:55 - it thinks it is and then just throw that
08:57 - as an index to this list so we can get
08:59 - what label this alright sweet so that is
09:03 - how we're getting the data now so now I
09:06 - want to show you what some of these
09:07 - images look like and talk about the
09:10 - architecture of the neural network we
09:11 - might use in the next video so I'm gonna
09:14 - use PI plot just to show you some of
09:16 - these images and explain kind of the
09:18 - input and the output and all that so if
09:21 - you want to show an image using
09:22 - matplotlib you can do this by just doing
09:24 - PLT imshow and then in here simply
09:28 - putting the image so for example if i do
09:29 - train not labels images and let's say we
09:33 - do the seventh image and then I do PLT
09:36 - dot show if I run this now you guys will
09:40 - see what this image is so let's run this
09:43 - and you can see that we get this is
09:46 - actually I believe like a pullover or a
09:47 - hoodie now I know it looks weird and
09:49 - you've got all this like green and
09:51 - purple that's just because of the way
09:53 - that kind of matplotlib shows these
09:55 - images if you want to see it properly
09:56 - what you do is I believe you do see map
09:59 - equals in this case
10:00 - PLT dot see it I think it's like cm de
10:04 - binary or something I gotta have a look
10:07 - here because I forget
10:08 - yeah CM binary so if we do this and now
10:11 - we decide to display the image it should
10:12 - look a little bit better let's see here
10:15 - and there you go we can see now we're
10:17 - actually getting this like black and
10:18 - white kind of image now this is great
10:21 - and all but let me show you actually
10:23 - what our image looks like so like how
10:24 - was I just able to show like how was I
10:26 - just able to do this image well the
10:28 - reason I'm able to do that is because
10:29 - all of our images are actually a raise
10:31 - of 28 by 28 pixels so let me print one
10:35 - out for you here so if I do train
10:36 - underscore images let's do seven the
10:38 - same example here and print that to the
10:40 - screen I'll show you what the data
10:41 - actually looks like give it a second and
10:45 - there we go so you can see this is
10:46 - obviously what our data looks like it's
10:48 - just a bunch of lists
10:50 - so one lists for each row and it just
10:53 - has pixel values and these pixel values
10:55 - are simply representative of I believe
10:57 - like how much I don't actually know the
11:00 - scale that they're on but I think it's
11:02 - like an RGB value but in grayscale right
11:05 - so for example we have like zero
11:07 - 2:255 we're 255 is black and zero is
11:10 - white and I'm pretty sure that's how
11:12 - getting me information in someone can
11:14 - correct me if I'm wrong but I'm almost
11:15 - certain that that's how this actually
11:16 - works so this is gray Knoll but this is
11:20 - these are large numbers and remember I
11:22 - was saying before in the previous video
11:24 - that's typically a good idea to shrink
11:25 - our data down so that it's with it
11:27 - within a certain range that is a bit
11:30 - smaller so in this case what I'm
11:32 - actually going to do is I'm gonna modify
11:34 - this information a little bit so that we
11:35 - only have each value out of one so we
11:39 - instead of having no 255 we have it out
11:41 - of one so the way to do that is to
11:42 - divide every single pixel value by 255
11:45 - now because these trained images are
11:48 - actually stored in what's known as a
11:50 - numpy array we can simply just divide it
11:52 - by 255 to achieve that so we'll say
11:57 - trained images equals trained images /
11:58 - 255 and we'll do the same thing here
12:01 - with our test images as well now
12:03 - obviously we don't have to modify the
12:05 - labels as well also because they're just
12:07 - between 0 & 9 and that's how the labels
12:09 - work but for our images we're going to
12:11 - divide those values so that it's a bit
12:13 - nicer so now let me show you what it
12:15 - looks like so if I go python tutorial 1
12:16 - del pine and now you can see that we're
12:19 - getting these decimal values and that
12:21 - our shirt looks well the same but
12:23 - exactly like we've just shrunk down our
12:25 - data so it's gonna be easier to work
12:27 - with in the future with our model now
12:29 - that's about it I think that I'm gonna
12:31 - show you guys in terms of this data now
12:33 - we have our data loaded in and we're
12:34 - pretty much ready to go in terms of
12:36 - making a model now if you have any
12:38 - questions about the data please don't
12:40 - hesitate to leave a comment down below
12:41 - but essentially again the way it works
12:43 - is we're gonna have 28 by 28 pixel
12:45 - images and they're gonna come in as an
12:47 - array just as I've showed you here so
12:49 - these are all the values that we're
12:50 - gonna have we're gonna pass that to our
12:52 - model and then our model is gonna spit
12:53 - out what class it thinks it is and those
12:55 - classes are gonna be between 0 & 9
12:57 - obviously 0 is gonna represent a t-shirt
13:00 - where 9 is gonna represent ankle boots
13:01 - and we will deal with that all in the
13:04 - next video so with that being said I
13:05 - hope you guys enjoyed if you did please
13:06 - make sure to leave a like and subscribe
13:08 - and I will see you in the next video
13:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome to the second video in the neural network tutorial series now in today's video what we're gonna be doing is actually getting our hands dirty and working with a bit of code and loading in our first data set so we're not actually gonna do anything with the model right now we're gonna do that in the next video this video is gonna be dedicated to understanding data the importance of data how we can scale that data look at it and understand how that's going to affect our model when training the most important part of machine learning at least in my opinion is the

getting the right information to our model and having it in the correct form is something that is way more challenging than it may seem with these initial data sets that we're gonna work with things

honest but I'm just using the data sets that they have and a little bit of the code that they have here because it's a very nice introduction to machine learning and neural networks but there's a lot

reading this off the website because if you have no experience with neural networks it is kind of confusing some of the stuff they do here and they don't really talk about why they use certain things or whatnot so anyways the data set we're gonna be working with today is known as the fashion mmiss data set so you may have heard of the old does so which is image image classification but it was like digits so like you had digits from 0 to 9 and the neural network about classified digits this one's a very similar principle except we're gonna be doing it with like tshirts and pants and what do you call it sandals and all that so these are kind of some examples what the images look like and we'll be showing them as well in the code so that's enough about it I felt like I should tell you guys

line text and executing my Python files from the command line just because this is something that will work for everyone no matter what but feel free to work in ideally feel for you to work in pi tram

you talked about this in the previous Michigan learning tutorials I did but essentially what you want to do with any kind of machine learning algorithm especially a neural network is you don't want to pass all of your data into the network when you train it you want to pass about 90 80% of your data to the network to train it and then you want to test the network for accuracy and making sure that it works properly on the rest of your data that it hasn't seen yet now the reason you'd want to do this and a lot of people would say why don't I just give all my dad's the network could it make it better not necessarily and that's because if you test your data on if you test your network on data it's already seen then you can't be sure that it's not just simply memorizing the data it's seen right for example if you show me five images and then like you tell me the classes of all of them and then you show me that the same image again you say what's the class and I get it right well did I get it right because I figured out how to analyze the images properly or because I'd already seen it and I knew what it was right I just memorized what it was so that's something we want to try to avoid with our models so whenever we have our data we're gonna split it up into testing and training data and that's what we're gonna do right here so to do this I'm gonna say train in this case train underscore images and train understory labels combi in this case test underscore images comma test underscore and labels and then we say this is equal to data dot get underscore data so not get low done we're done now the reason we can do this is just because this load data method is gonna return information in a way where we can kind of split it up like this in most cases when you're writing your own models for your own data you're gonna have to write your own arrays and for loops and load and data and do all this fancy stuff but Chara's makes it nice and easy for us just by allowing us to write this line here which will get us our training and testing data in the for kind of variables that we need so quickly let me talk about what labels are now so for this specific data set there are 10 labels that means each image that we have will have a specific label assigned to it now if I actually I'll show you by just printing out if I print for example train underscore labels and let's just print like the 0 if I guess the first training label so let me just run this file so python tutorial 1 you can see that we simply get the number 9 now this is just what is represent like the label representation so obviously it's not giving us a string but let's say if I pick for example 6 and I hit enter here you can see that the label is 7 so the labels are between 0 & 9 so 10 labels in total now the thing is that's not very useful to us because we don't really know what label 0 is will label 9 is so what I'm gonna do is create a list that will actually define what those labels are so I'm gonna have to copy it from here because I actually don't remember the labels but you can see it says here what they are so for example label 0 is a tshirt label 1 is a trouser 9 is an ankle boot and you can see what they all are so we just need to define exactly this list here so class names so that we can simply take whatever value is turn to us from the model of what label it thinks it is and then just throw that as an index to this list so we can get what label this alright sweet so that is how we're getting the data now so now I want to show you what some of these images look like and talk about the architecture of the neural network we might use in the next video so I'm gonna use PI plot just to show you some of these images and explain kind of the input and the output and all that so if you want to show an image using matplotlib you can do this by just doing PLT imshow and then in here simply putting the image so for example if i do train not labels images and let's say we do the seventh image and then I do PLT dot show if I run this now you guys will see what this image is so let's run this and you can see that we get this is actually I believe like a pullover or a hoodie now I know it looks weird and you've got all this like green and purple that's just because of the way that kind of matplotlib shows these images if you want to see it properly what you do is I believe you do see map equals in this case PLT dot see it I think it's like cm de binary or something I gotta have a look here because I forget yeah CM binary so if we do this and now we decide to display the image it should look a little bit better let's see here and there you go we can see now we're actually getting this like black and white kind of image now this is great and all but let me show you actually what our image looks like so like how was I just able to show like how was I just able to do this image well the reason I'm able to do that is because all of our images are actually a raise of 28 by 28 pixels so let me print one out for you here so if I do train underscore images let's do seven the same example here and print that to the screen I'll show you what the data actually looks like give it a second and there we go so you can see this is obviously what our data looks like it's just a bunch of lists so one lists for each row and it just has pixel values and these pixel values are simply representative of I believe like how much I don't actually know the scale that they're on but I think it's like an RGB value but in grayscale right so for example we have like zero 2255 we're 255 is black and zero is white and I'm pretty sure that's how getting me information in someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I'm almost certain that that's how this actually works so this is gray Knoll but this is these are large numbers and remember I was saying before in the previous video that's typically a good idea to shrink our data down so that it's with it within a certain range that is a bit smaller so in this case what I'm actually going to do is I'm gonna modify this information a little bit so that we only have each value out of one so we instead of having no 255 we have it out of one so the way to do that is to divide every single pixel value by 255 now because these trained images are actually stored in what's known as a numpy array we can simply just divide it by 255 to achieve that so we'll say trained images equals trained images / 255 and we'll do the same thing here with our test images as well now obviously we don't have to modify the labels as well also because they're just between 0 & 9 and that's how the labels work but for our images we're going to divide those values so that it's a bit nicer so now let me show you what it looks like so if I go python tutorial 1 del pine and now you can see that we're getting these decimal values and that our shirt looks well the same but exactly like we've just shrunk down our data so it's gonna be easier to work with in the future with our model now that's about it I think that I'm gonna show you guys in terms of this data now we have our data loaded in and we're pretty much ready to go in terms of making a model now if you have any questions about the data please don't hesitate to leave a comment down below but essentially again the way it works is we're gonna have 28 by 28 pixel images and they're gonna come in as an array just as I've showed you here so these are all the values that we're gonna have we're gonna pass that to our model and then our model is gonna spit out what class it thinks it is and those classes are gonna be between 0 & 9 obviously 0 is gonna represent a tshirt where 9 is gonna represent ankle boots and we will deal with that all in the next video so with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed if you did please make sure to leave a like and subscribe and I will see you in the next video
