00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - youtube video in today's video i'm going
00:04 - to be talking about how much money you
00:06 - can make with a gaming computer mining
00:09 - ethereum so that pretty much means how
00:10 - much money you're going to be able to
00:12 - make with one graphics card mining
00:14 - ethereum today at the current price
00:16 - of
00:17 - 460
00:19 - now this is going to change based on the
00:21 - price of ethereum and the difficulty of
00:23 - mining ethereum so this video may not be
00:26 - relevant in about a month or two but
00:27 - currently at this all-time high price of
00:29 - 460 dollars you can definitely make a
00:31 - lot of money mining ethereum with simply
00:33 - one graphics card so let's go ahead and
00:36 - get started with the video now i'm going
00:38 - to apologize before i even start um my
00:41 - voice is very raspy i've been sick for
00:43 - the past week so i'm just trying to get
00:44 - a video for you guys this weekend um
00:47 - so yeah please don't
00:49 - get too mad at me for my voice sounding
00:51 - like death
00:53 - but yeah
00:54 - all right so let's get started with the
00:56 - rx 480. so on the left here i have a
00:59 - bunch of different graphics cards i have
01:00 - six of them these are just common cards
01:02 - that may be in a mid to high-end gaming
01:04 - pc that you're able to mine with so
01:07 - again if you don't know much about
01:08 - mining you have to have at least four
01:10 - gigabytes of video ram in your graphics
01:12 - card to be able to mine so this means
01:14 - the gtx 1060 three gigabyte model is not
01:17 - on here as you can't actually use that
01:19 - to mine at the current tag size of
01:21 - ethereum now i have also the estimated
01:24 - mega hash per second and the estimated
01:27 - power draw of all of these cards in my
01:29 - little chart over here these are just
01:31 - averages and they're going to be
01:33 - different depending on what card you
01:34 - have and what system you're running them
01:36 - in so
01:37 - i just looked online for the average
01:39 - mega hash per second on these cards
01:40 - obviously i don't have six video cards
01:42 - so i can't test them out all for you
01:44 - and this is just what i found so it's
01:47 - going to be different
01:48 - for you guys and it's going to vary a
01:50 - little bit
01:51 - all right so let's go ahead and get
01:53 - started so the website i'm going to be
01:54 - using for this is just cryptocompare.com
01:57 - and if you simply just type in ethereum
01:59 - mining profibility you'll find this
02:00 - website and you'll be able to see how
02:02 - much money you can make mining ethereum
02:04 - and other cryptocurrencies based on your
02:06 - hash rate and your power consumption so
02:08 - for the first car the rx 480 that's
02:10 - actually the card that i have
02:11 - we're going to be getting about 24 and a
02:13 - half
02:15 - mega hash per second now this again i
02:17 - get 23 mega hash per second some people
02:19 - get 27 so it's going to vary and this is
02:22 - just stock settings so not overclocked
02:25 - nothing done with the power consumption
02:27 - as well
02:28 - all right and we're going to be drawing
02:29 - about 130 watts at full load which is
02:32 - going to net us
02:33 - a nice 460 dollars per year
02:36 - uh mining ethereum and this is in u.s
02:38 - dollars
02:39 - so go ahead and put 460 in our chart
02:43 - here so we can compare later and this is
02:45 - your profit so
02:47 - if you aren't paying electricity you're
02:49 - actually going to be making about 600
02:50 - per year as you don't have to pay for
02:53 - your power cost
02:54 - all right so let's go ahead to the next
02:55 - one the rx 580 it's a very similar card
02:58 - to the rx 480 gonna be getting about 25
03:01 - megahertz per second on this card with a
03:04 - power drop slightly less 120 watts
03:07 - making us 483 dollars per year mining
03:11 - ethereum
03:12 - our next card the gtx 1070 so getting a
03:15 - little bit higher on the on the scale
03:17 - here this card is going to use about 180
03:19 - watts
03:21 - and it's going to mine at about 28 and a
03:23 - half to 29 mega hash per second
03:26 - netting us 505 dollars per year
03:30 - and these are us dollars all right gtx
03:33 - 1080 so this is one definitely the
03:35 - highest end card um that most of you
03:37 - guys will probably have in your system
03:38 - with 11 gigabytes of video ram we're
03:41 - going to be using about 230 to 250 watts
03:44 - on full draw so i'll just put 230 in
03:45 - there to be conservative
03:47 - and we're going to be mining at about 32
03:49 - mega hash per second which is getting us
03:52 - about 537 dollars per year
03:56 - all right the next one gtx 1060 six
03:59 - gigabyte so again going down a little
04:01 - bit not as a high end as a card 120
04:04 - watts
04:05 - we're going to be getting about
04:07 - 20 megahertz per second close to that so
04:09 - we're going to be getting about 350
04:12 - per year with this card
04:15 - all right now the gtx 750 ti so this is
04:18 - definitely a lower end card you can
04:19 - still run some pretty good games on it
04:21 - but for mining you can see its
04:22 - performance does lack
04:24 - with only getting about 12 mega hash per
04:26 - second here with a power consumption of
04:28 - 90 you're really not going to be making
04:30 - that much with this card a little more
04:32 - than the price of the card so
04:35 - about 197 dollars per year mining
04:38 - ethereum
04:40 - now these are all your estimated numbers
04:42 - on how much you're going to make in u.s
04:43 - dollars since i'm canadian i would want
04:46 - to go and convert these into canadian
04:48 - dollars to see how much they are um so
04:50 - right now at the current price of
04:51 - ethereum it's not bad considering these
04:54 - costs right here are about the same if
04:56 - not more than the cost of the video
04:58 - cards so you can see our best card the
05:00 - gtx 1080 is gonna get about 540 dollars
05:03 - and that is if the price of ethereum
05:05 - stays the same as it is right now so as
05:08 - you can see here the price of ethereum
05:10 - does fluctuate quite a bit and this is
05:12 - really going to dictate how much money
05:13 - you're going to be able to make mining
05:15 - it
05:15 - so when people were mining up here
05:17 - you're making a ton of money
05:19 - when you're mining down here at a low of
05:21 - about 200 maybe even lower than that
05:24 - you're really not making that much money
05:26 - it's all about knowing when to sell your
05:27 - cryptocurrency um and when to hold on to
05:30 - it
05:30 - so yeah that's pretty much been my video
05:32 - on how much money you can make mining
05:34 - ethereum um per year now again this is
05:38 - definitely going to vary depending on
05:39 - the system you're running um how much
05:41 - power you're running so here on this
05:43 - website i only actually put in the power
05:45 - draw of the card i didn't put in the
05:47 - power draw of the average computer
05:48 - because it's going to depend on what
05:50 - system you're running if you're running
05:51 - a low end motherboard low end processor
05:53 - that doesn't use a lot of power then
05:55 - this number is going to be lower for
05:57 - your overall computer power draw
06:00 - same thing if you're running a higher
06:01 - end system with a higher
06:03 - power supply a higher end cpu
06:07 - you're going to be using more power so
06:08 - yeah i just put in the power consumption
06:10 - of the card you can expect that you're
06:12 - going to be paying a little bit more in
06:14 - electricity cost as your system is going
06:16 - to be running as well as your graphics
06:18 - card so yeah that's been it for this
06:19 - video if you guys enjoyed please leave a
06:21 - like and subscribe and i will see you
06:22 - again in another

hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video in today's video i'm going to be talking about how much money you can make with a gaming computer mining ethereum so that pretty much means how much

with the power consumption as well all right and we're going to be drawing about 130 watts at full load which is going to net us a nice 460 dollars per year uh mining ethereum and this is in u.s dollars so go ahead and put 460 in our chart here so we can compare later and this is your profit so if you aren't paying electricity you're actually going to be making about 600 per year as you don't have to pay for your power cost all right so let's go ahead to the next one the rx 580 it's a very similar card to the rx 480 gonna be getting about 25 megahertz per second on this card with a power drop slightly less 120 watts making us 483 dollars per year mining ethereum our next card the gtx 1070 so getting a little bit higher on the on the scale here this card is going to use about 180 watts and it's going to mine at about 28 and a half to 29 mega hash per second netting us 505 dollars per year and these are us dollars all right gtx 1080 so this is one definitely the highest end card um that most of you guys will probably have in your system with 11 gigabytes of video ram we're going to be using about 230 to 250 watts on full draw so i'll just put 230 in there to be conservative and we're going to be mining at about 32 mega hash per second which is getting us about 537 dollars per year all right the next one gtx 1060 six gigabyte so again going down a little bit not as a high end as a card 120 watts we're going to be getting about 20 megahertz per second close to that so we're going to be getting about 350 per year with this card all right now the gtx 750 ti so this is definitely a lower end card you can still run some pretty good games on it but for mining you can see its performance does lack with only getting about 12 mega hash per second here with a power consumption of 90 you're really not going to be making that much with this card a little more than the price of the card so about 197 dollars per year mining ethereum now these are all your estimated

ethereum it's not bad considering these costs right here are about the same if not more than the cost of the video cards so you can see our best card the gtx 1080 is gonna get about 540 dollars and that is if the price of ethereum stays the same as it is right now so as you can see here the price of ethereum does fluctuate quite a bit and this is really going to dictate how much money you're

making that much money it's all about knowing when to sell your cryptocurrency um and when to hold on to it so yeah that's pretty much been my video on how much money you can make mining ethereum um per year now again this is definitely going to vary depending on the system you're running um how much power you're running so here on this website i only actually put in the power draw of the card i didn't put in the power draw of the average computer because it's going to depend on what system you're running if you're running a low end motherboard low end processor that doesn't use a lot of power then this number is going to be lower for your overall computer power draw same thing if you're running a higher end system with a higher power supply a higher end cpu you're going to be using more power so yeah i just put in the power consumption of the card you can expect that you're going to be paying a little bit more in electricity cost as your system is going to be running as well as your graphics card so yeah that's been it for this video if you guys enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and i will see you again in another
