00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - in this video i'm going to be testing my
00:10 - python skills by going through a bunch
00:12 - of interactive python quizzes i'm
00:14 - probably going to start easy and then
00:16 - move into some more challenging ones as
00:18 - i do consider myself to be pretty good
00:19 - at python so i'm hoping i'm not going to
00:21 - be proven wrong here by these quizzes
00:24 - now these quizzes are available on the
00:25 - real python website this is an awesome
00:27 - website by the way i use this all of the
00:29 - time it has really great content and
00:31 - i'll leave the link to them in the
00:32 - description i thought this would be cool
00:34 - though because you guys can compare
00:35 - yourself to me and see how many you get
00:38 - correct versus myself and then maybe i
00:40 - can explain some more complicated
00:41 - questions with that said i do quickly
00:43 - want to mention that right now at the
00:45 - time of filming i'm about 5 000
00:47 - subscribers away from 1 million on
00:49 - youtube so if you're watching this
00:51 - please leave a subscribe it helped me
00:53 - get to 1 million i would really
00:54 - appreciate that and now i am actually
00:57 - going to ask you a quiz question before
00:59 - we proceed and go through all of these
01:01 - interactive quizzes so the question is
01:04 - the following what is the sponsor of
01:06 - this video and you're going to have to
01:08 - watch the next minute to find that out
01:10 - before we get started i need to thank

01:59 - try mailgun today by using my link
02:02 - mailgun.com tech with tim alright so
02:05 - hopefully you guys appreciate them being
02:06 - a bit creative with the sponsorship
02:07 - segways at least i'm trying to let's
02:09 - just dive in though and get into this
02:11 - interactive quiz i'm gonna start with
02:13 - basic data types in python now i don't
02:16 - have any idea how hard these quizzes are
02:18 - this sounds like it's gonna be really
02:19 - easy like what's a boolean what's a
02:21 - string what's an integer but it could be
02:23 - a lot more complicated so let's let's
02:24 - see here okay let's start the quiz uh in
02:27 - python 3 the maximum value for an
02:28 - integer is 2 to the 63 minus 1.
02:31 - okay already i have no idea if this is
02:34 - correct or not um i don't even know if
02:36 - there is a maximum value in python i've
02:38 - never seen like a maximum so
02:42 - my feeling is to go false because i
02:43 - don't think there's a maximum but there
02:45 - also would have to be up right um 2 to
02:48 - the 63 minus one seems like that would
02:50 - be the maximum if there was one but
02:52 - i think i'm just going to go with false
02:53 - because again i i have no idea what it
02:56 - would be so let's just let's go false
02:58 - uh okay apparently that was correct
02:59 - let's see what it says here uh limit was
03:02 - removed in python 3 it means there is no
03:04 - defined limit but the amount of
03:06 - available address space on your machine
03:08 - okay
03:09 - um
03:10 - how would you express the hexadecimal
03:12 - value a5
03:14 - as a base 16 integer constant
03:16 - okay so i believe that the hexadecimal
03:19 - in python is 0x i think you lead 0x
03:23 - now a5 i think i can literally just
03:25 - write a5 um
03:28 - yeah i yeah i think that's fine let's
03:30 - try that
03:30 - okay let's go nice
03:32 - next uh how would you express the
03:34 - constant floating point value 3.2 times
03:37 - 10 to the negative 12 in python uh so
03:40 - you have to do something with like e
03:41 - here so it'd be 3.2 asterisks and then
03:45 - this would be 10e
03:47 - negative 12.
03:48 - that's what i think it is but i don't
03:50 - know if you do the e like this so let's
03:52 - try that and was i close
03:55 - um oh it's you just you don't need the
03:58 - 10. okay i mean i think that was pretty
04:00 - good i had the e so if i just removed
04:01 - the 10 it would have worked i also
04:02 - didn't need the uh
04:04 - what do you call it yeah okay i got
04:06 - makes sense okay i'm i'm fine with that
04:08 - one let's go next uh which of the
04:10 - following are valid ways to specify the
04:11 - string literal foo bar in python
04:15 - okay that's not going to be good because
04:17 - you're going to have two
04:19 - separate strings this will work because
04:21 - you're escaping that although oh no it
04:24 - wants that character yeah okay so that
04:25 - will work
04:26 - this will work because you're wrapping
04:28 - the single quote in double quotes this
04:30 - will not work
04:31 - this i believe will work so let's see if
04:33 - that's correct and there we go nice okay
04:36 - next question write an expression for a
04:38 - literal or string literal consisting of
04:40 - the following ascii characters
04:41 - horizontal tab character new line
04:43 - character the character with hexadecimal
04:45 - value 7e
04:46 - oh my god okay
04:48 - a string literal so let's go
04:51 - horizontal tab i believe is slash t
04:53 - uh the new line character i believe is
04:55 - slash n
04:57 - it might be slash r here but i think
04:58 - slash n is is correct
05:00 - and then the hexadecimal value i have no
05:02 - idea what this would be but i would
05:04 - imagine i would escape the zero
05:07 - zero x seven e
05:09 - um
05:10 - i i don't know how to do the hex at all
05:12 - i i think these are correct for the
05:13 - first two but i have no clue what the
05:15 - hex decimal is so let's just try that
05:17 - okay of course that's incorrect uh what
05:19 - is this saying the answer is here okay
05:20 - so i didn't need the zero i just need to
05:22 - escape the x7e
05:24 - and there we go okay you know what i i
05:26 - can live with that i've never had to
05:27 - embed a hexadecimal character in a
05:29 - string before so i'm fine with that okay
05:31 - next question uh consider the statement
05:34 - prince and then you have r foo backslash
05:37 - backslash bar backslash n baz okay which
05:40 - of the phone is the correct repel output
05:43 - oh my god
05:44 - uh i don't even know what the r does
05:46 - when it when it leads that um
05:50 - i have no clue what this would be the
05:52 - backslash n should move it down though
05:54 - so i think that's it
05:56 - really okay so r i guess means ignore
05:58 - the backslash yeah okay r i guess means
06:01 - you ignore any escape characters that's
06:03 - that's very strange i've never seen that
06:05 - before okay next question this is
06:07 - supposed to be basic data types these
06:08 - are really hard for basic data types uh
06:11 - which the following is not a python
06:13 - built in function okay so i know map i
06:15 - know round i know is instance wrapper i
06:18 - think it's diff
06:19 - okay correct
06:21 - all right guys that was a little bit
06:22 - rough i'm uh i'm not gonna lie to you
06:24 - here that was
06:26 - a lot more difficult than i thought it
06:27 - was gonna be let me go back to the main
06:29 - page and see if we can do another quiz
06:31 - and we'll see how hard that one is
06:32 - alright guys so i'm back to the main
06:34 - page here i'm not gonna lie that was
06:35 - really hard i thought these were gonna
06:37 - be easier especially because those basic
06:39 - data types and that was like really
06:40 - obscure and like specific stuff that
06:43 - you're probably never gonna have to know
06:45 - i was looking through here there's a few
06:47 - uh python dictionaries looks decent i
06:48 - clicked on it just to see python
06:50 - conditional statements let's just do
06:52 - conditional statements here and see nine
06:53 - questions
06:54 - let's go through it in a python program
06:57 - a control structure defines a program
06:59 - specific data structure manages the
07:00 - input output of control characters
07:02 - directs the order of execution dictates
07:04 - what happens okay directs the order of
07:06 - execution that one was an easier one
07:08 - which of the following if statements
07:09 - will not execute successfully uh this
07:12 - will not execute
07:14 - because it does not have indentation
07:15 - this might that will work that will work
07:18 - that will work okay so it's got to be
07:20 - that one very good
07:22 - next uh what signifies the end of a
07:24 - statement block or suite in python
07:26 - statement block or sweet a line that is
07:28 - indented less than the previous line not
07:31 - end not a comment not that so yeah it's
07:32 - gonna be that okay much easier much much
07:35 - easier already
07:36 - uh although i don't want to speak too
07:37 - soon what is the output of the following
07:39 - code snippet
07:40 - four bar in
07:42 - and this is foo bar baz
07:46 - okay this is weird i think this is going
07:47 - to be oh if bar sorry i thought i said
07:49 - far if bar is in foo so it is in there
07:51 - so this will print
07:53 - so we'll get one
07:54 - two
07:55 - well that's not gonna work so we'll just
07:57 - get one two four i believe that's
07:59 - correct
08:00 - all right much much easier
08:03 - suppose you have the valid or the
08:04 - following variables defined write a
08:06 - python if else statement to assign the
08:08 - smaller of a and b to the variable m
08:11 - okay uh the smaller of a and b
08:17 - uh write an if-else statement i'm a
08:18 - little bit confused because these are
08:19 - predefined values that ask me to write
08:21 - an if statement
08:22 - write a python if-else statement to
08:24 - assign the smaller of a and b to the
08:27 - variable
08:28 - m i mean could i not just do the min
08:30 - function though okay so i'm going to say
08:32 - if
08:33 - a is less than b
08:35 - then m
08:36 - is equal to
08:38 - a else
08:40 - m is equal to b
08:42 - i mean let's double check this
08:45 - assign the smaller of a and b to the
08:46 - variable i'm okay so a okay
08:49 - yeah okay good that was kind of a weird
08:51 - question again uh the following if l if
08:54 - else statement will raise a key error
08:56 - exception
08:57 - uh if the
08:59 - yes so if d is not in the dictionary
09:00 - then it will raise an exception you have
09:02 - to use dot get so that's true
09:05 - what if d does not refer to an invalid
09:07 - key but the expression in that elif
09:08 - clause never
09:09 - oh
09:10 - sir i didn't even consider the fact that
09:12 - it's not going to execute okay that
09:14 - makes sense i should have read the whole
09:15 - thing okay next question
09:17 - that's why you don't rush i guess on the
09:18 - quizzes which of the following are valid
09:20 - if else statements in python assuming x
09:22 - and y are defined properly
09:24 - if x is less than y if x is greater than
09:27 - 10 print foo i believe that will
09:28 - actually be valid i think that works
09:31 - um
09:33 - this no i don't think this wait if this
09:36 - do that else this
09:39 - this like i think this might work but
09:41 - i'm not sure if that's exactly the
09:43 - syntax on on how you write that
09:46 - uh
09:48 - the semicolons i think actually work as
09:50 - well again again i'm not quite sure here
09:53 - this i don't think will work because of
09:54 - the indentation
09:56 - are all of these correct
09:58 - which is following yeah again these are
10:00 - really weird i've never really seen it
10:02 - written this way i think that will work
10:04 - if another if and then the print that
10:06 - looks like it might work
10:09 - this one with the semicolons i think
10:10 - will work i think if you add semicolons
10:12 - that's fine this one i don't think this
10:14 - works because the else has a colon i
10:16 - don't think you need a colon after the
10:17 - else um and this one here looks like it
10:21 - might work so let's try this
10:23 - okay so this one doesn't actually work
10:25 - you can't do two if statements but these
10:26 - ones are good again very obscure stuff
10:28 - here um but that's fine okay i'll move
10:30 - on to the next question
10:32 - all right what is the value of this
10:33 - expression a plus x if one two three dot
10:36 - is digit else y plus b yeah c you don't
10:39 - actually have the um
10:40 - what do you call it the colon here
10:42 - right the else doesn't have the colon
10:44 - okay so a plus x if one two three
10:48 - okay what is the value of this
10:49 - expression yeah so that is a digit
10:51 - otherwise this so i think it's just ax
10:53 - right
10:54 - i don't know why it would be anything
10:55 - else than that
10:56 - okay very good
10:58 - uh suppose you have two variables x and
10:59 - y to find write a stub if statement to
11:02 - evaluate whether x is less than y
11:05 - the statement should not do anything
11:06 - even if the condition is true
11:08 - write a stub if statement imagine the
11:09 - stub if statement is it's saying like
11:11 - just write an inline if statement that
11:13 - doesn't do anything at all um i don't
11:15 - know what it means by stub though let's
11:17 - get a hint here
11:18 - hint use the past ah gotcha okay that
11:21 - makes sense now so suppose you have x
11:24 - and y register if x is less than y if x
11:26 - less than y
11:28 - then just
11:29 - pass is that what they mean
11:31 - okay that was yeah all right complete
11:33 - quiz and check results okay 770 percent
11:36 - i think one of the questions i got wrong
11:37 - i should have got correct the other one
11:38 - i just didn't know with the if statement
11:40 - much better all right so i think i'm
11:43 - going to end it here i don't know if you
11:44 - guys found this entertaining or not if
11:46 - you or if you were able to follow along
11:48 - again i found this pretty challenging
11:49 - these were some really obscure kind of
11:51 - strange python questions i know that is
11:54 - python for you but a lot of the stuff
11:56 - i've genuinely never seen in my like
11:58 - seven or eight years of writing code in
12:00 - python you know what take what you want
12:02 - from that but uh yeah that that's my
12:04 - thoughts on this quiz some very very
12:05 - strange questions especially for titles
12:08 - like conditional statements and whatnot
12:10 - although i guess now i know and i've
12:12 - learned a few things with that said
12:13 - though i hope you guys enjoyed if you
12:15 - did make sure to leave a like if you
12:16 - want to see more videos like this then
12:18 - let me know in the comments down below
12:20 - help me get to a million subscribers by
12:21 - hitting that subscribe button if you are
12:23 - not already and i will see you in the

Cleaned transcript:

in this video i'm going to be testing my python skills by going through a bunch of interactive python quizzes i'm probably going to start easy and then move into some more challenging ones as i do consider myself to be pretty good at python so i'm hoping i'm not going to be proven wrong here by these quizzes now these quizzes are available on the real python website this is an awesome website by the way i use this all of the time it has really great content and i'll leave the link to them in the description i thought this would be cool though because you guys can compare yourself to me and see how many you get correct versus myself and then maybe i can explain some more complicated questions with that said i do quickly want to mention that right now at the time of filming i'm about 5 000 subscribers away from 1 million on youtube so if you're watching this please leave a subscribe it helped me get to 1 million i would really appreciate that and now i am actually going to ask you a quiz question before we proceed and go through all of these interactive quizzes so the question is the following what is the sponsor of this video and you're going to have to watch the next minute to find that out before we get started i need to thank mailgun for sponsoring this video mailgun lets you send transactional or bulk emails effortlessly regardless of your business use case mail guns ease of use worldclass support and powerful apis empower smart development teams to reach customers at scale mailgun can even prevent fake signups remove invalid email addresses and overall improve your email delivery and conversion rates mailgun controls the entire email life cycle from predeployment through delivery of over 240 billion emails per year for companies like dhl wikipedia lyft and microsoft better yet mail gun send time optimization automatically finds the ideal time to send emails for each individual recipient to improve engagement thank you again to mailgun for sponsoring this video make sure to try mailgun today by using my link mailgun.com tech with tim alright so hopefully you guys appreciate them being a bit creative with the sponsorship segways at least i'm trying to let's just dive in though and get into this interactive quiz i'm gonna start with basic data types in python now i don't have any idea how hard these quizzes are this sounds like it's gonna be really easy like what's a boolean what's a string what's an integer but it could be a lot more complicated so let's let's see here okay let's start the quiz uh in python 3 the maximum value for an integer is 2 to the 63 minus 1. okay already i have no idea if this is correct or not um i don't even know if there is a maximum value in python i've never seen like a maximum so my feeling is to go false because i don't think there's a maximum but there also would have to be up right um 2 to the 63 minus one seems like that would be the maximum if there was one but i think i'm just going to go with false because again i i have no idea what it would be so let's just let's go false uh okay apparently that was correct let's see what it says here uh limit was removed in python 3 it means there is no defined limit but the amount of available address space on your machine okay um how would you express the hexadecimal value a5 as a base 16 integer constant okay so i believe that the hexadecimal in python is 0x i think you lead 0x now a5 i think i can literally just write a5 um yeah i yeah i think that's fine let's try that okay let's go nice next uh how would you express the constant floating point value 3.2 times 10 to the negative 12 in python uh so you have to do something with like e here so it'd be 3.2 asterisks and then this would be 10e negative 12. that's what i think it is but i don't know if you do the e like this so let's try that and was i close um oh it's you just you don't need the 10. okay i mean i think that was pretty good i had the e so if i just removed the 10 it would have worked i also didn't need the uh what do you call it yeah okay i got makes sense okay i'm i'm fine with that one let's go next uh which of the following are valid ways to specify the string literal foo bar in python okay that's not going to be good because you're going to have two separate strings this will work because you're escaping that although oh no it wants that character yeah okay so that will work this will work because you're wrapping the single quote in double quotes this will not work this i believe will work so let's see if that's correct and there we go nice okay next question write an expression for a literal or string literal consisting of the following ascii characters horizontal tab character new line character the character with hexadecimal value 7e oh my god okay a string literal so let's go horizontal tab i believe is slash t uh the new line character i believe is slash n it might be slash r here but i think slash n is is correct and then the hexadecimal value i have no idea what this would be but i would imagine i would escape the zero zero x seven e um i i don't know how to do the hex at all i i think these are correct for the first two but i have no clue what the hex decimal is so let's just try that okay of course that's incorrect uh what is this saying the answer is here okay so i didn't need the zero i just need to escape the x7e and there we go okay you know what i i can live with that i've never had to embed a hexadecimal character in a string before so i'm fine with that okay next question uh consider the statement prince and then you have r foo backslash backslash bar backslash n baz okay which of the phone is the correct repel output oh my god uh i don't even know what the r does when it when it leads that um i have no clue what this would be the backslash n should move it down though so i think that's it really okay so r i guess means ignore the backslash yeah okay r i guess means you ignore any escape characters that's that's very strange i've never seen that before okay next question this is supposed to be basic data types these are really hard for basic data types uh which the following is not a python built in function okay so i know map i know round i know is instance wrapper i think it's diff okay correct all right guys that was a little bit rough i'm uh i'm not gonna lie to you here that was a lot more difficult than i thought it was gonna be let me go back to the main page and see if we can do another quiz and we'll see how hard that one is alright guys so i'm back to the main page here i'm not gonna lie that was really hard i thought these were gonna be easier especially because those basic data types and that was like really obscure and like specific stuff that you're probably never gonna have to know i was looking through here there's a few uh python dictionaries looks decent i clicked on it just to see python conditional statements let's just do conditional statements here and see nine questions let's go through it in a python program a control structure defines a program specific data structure manages the input output of control characters directs the order of execution dictates what happens okay directs the order of execution that one was an easier one which of the following if statements will not execute successfully uh this will not execute because it does not have indentation this might that will work that will work that will work okay so it's got to be that one very good next uh what signifies the end of a statement block or suite in python statement block or sweet a line that is indented less than the previous line not end not a comment not that so yeah it's gonna be that okay much easier much much easier already uh although i don't want to speak too soon what is the output of the following code snippet four bar in and this is foo bar baz okay this is weird i think this is going to be oh if bar sorry i thought i said far if bar is in foo so it is in there so this will print so we'll get one two well that's not gonna work so we'll just get one two four i believe that's correct all right much much easier suppose you have the valid or the following variables defined write a python if else statement to assign the smaller of a and b to the variable m okay uh the smaller of a and b uh write an ifelse statement i'm a little bit confused because these are predefined values that ask me to write an if statement write a python ifelse statement to assign the smaller of a and b to the variable m i mean could i not just do the min function though okay so i'm going to say if a is less than b then m is equal to a else m is equal to b i mean let's double check this assign the smaller of a and b to the variable i'm okay so a okay yeah okay good that was kind of a weird question again uh the following if l if else statement will raise a key error exception uh if the yes so if d is not in the dictionary then it will raise an exception you have to use dot get so that's true what if d does not refer to an invalid key but the expression in that elif clause never oh sir i didn't even consider the fact that it's not going to execute okay that makes sense i should have read the whole thing okay next question that's why you don't rush i guess on the quizzes which of the following are valid if else statements in python assuming x and y are defined properly if x is less than y if x is greater than 10 print foo i believe that will actually be valid i think that works um this no i don't think this wait if this do that else this this like i think this might work but i'm not sure if that's exactly the syntax on on how you write that uh the semicolons i think actually work as well again again i'm not quite sure here this i don't think will work because of the indentation are all of these correct which is following yeah again these are really weird i've never really seen it written this way i think that will work if another if and then the print that looks like it might work this one with the semicolons i think will work i think if you add semicolons that's fine this one i don't think this works because the else has a colon i don't think you need a colon after the else um and this one here looks like it might work so let's try this okay so this one doesn't actually work you can't do two if statements but these ones are good again very obscure stuff here um but that's fine okay i'll move on to the next question all right what is the value of this expression a plus x if one two three dot is digit else y plus b yeah c you don't actually have the um what do you call it the colon here right the else doesn't have the colon okay so a plus x if one two three okay what is the value of this expression yeah so that is a digit otherwise this so i think it's just ax right i don't know why it would be anything else than that okay very good uh suppose you have two variables x and y to find write a stub if statement to evaluate whether x is less than y the statement should not do anything even if the condition is true write a stub if statement imagine the stub if statement is it's saying like just write an inline if statement that doesn't do anything at all um i don't know what it means by stub though let's get a hint here hint use the past ah gotcha okay that makes sense now so suppose you have x and y register if x is less than y if x less than y then just pass is that what they mean okay that was yeah all right complete quiz and check results okay 770 percent i think one of the questions i got wrong i should have got correct the other one i just didn't know with the if statement much better all right so i think i'm going to end it here i don't know if you guys found this entertaining or not if you or if you were able to follow along again i found this pretty challenging these were some really obscure kind of strange python questions i know that is python for you but a lot of the stuff i've genuinely never seen in my like seven or eight years of writing code in python you know what take what you want from that but uh yeah that that's my thoughts on this quiz some very very strange questions especially for titles like conditional statements and whatnot although i guess now i know and i've learned a few things with that said though i hope you guys
