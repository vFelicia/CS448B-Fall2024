00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - Raspberry Pi tutorial so in today's
00:03 - video I'm gonna be talking about the
00:05 - Raspberry Pi camera module of v2 now
00:09 - what I'm gonna be doing is showing you
00:10 - as first of all how to hook this up to
00:11 - our Raspberry Pi just this will just
00:13 - take a minute or two just to make sure
00:14 - we get the same correctly and then I'm
00:16 - gonna be showing you guys how we can
00:17 - take photos with this and record video
00:19 - now in the next video I'm gonna be
00:21 - showing you how we can actually stream
00:23 - live video from this using sockets and
00:26 - some cool Python code but for now on
00:29 - we're gonna start with the basics so
00:30 - photo and video now once you guys
00:32 - unpackage this you should see that you
00:34 - get your Raspberry Pi camera in a
00:36 - package that looks like this now I'm
00:38 - just gonna take it out here I've already
00:40 - actually used this but I'm just storing
00:41 - it in there for now you can see that my
00:43 - cable is slightly bent but that's
00:44 - alright now this is a pretty small
00:46 - camera but I believe it's something like
00:48 - 8 megapixels and actually takes decent
00:50 - photo and video now we're gonna be going
00:53 - through all the settings today but the
00:54 - first thing we need to do is just plug
00:55 - it into this Raspberry Pi now you want
00:58 - to be careful with this because it is
00:59 - fairly fragile and what we're gonna want
01:01 - to do is actually plug it into this slot
01:03 - right here now to open this up what
01:06 - we're gonna do I'm just using a
01:07 - screwdriver here is lift up the kind of
01:09 - the edges of this plastic here just
01:11 - being fairly gentle and you should see
01:14 - that this is actually lifted slightly
01:15 - just a little bit now what we're gonna
01:18 - do is we're gonna take this end here so
01:20 - where you can actually see the prongs
01:22 - I'm gonna plug them in so the blue is
01:24 - facing the back or the USB ports of the
01:27 - Raspberry Pi now once that's in there
01:29 - you're gonna make sure that's in nice
01:31 - and tight it's hard to kind of show this
01:33 - on video while I'm doing it and then
01:35 - you're going to press down on this black
01:39 - piece here until you hear it click snow
01:40 - since mine's in the case it's a little
01:42 - bit more difficult and I usually just
01:44 - use the screwdriver to make sure that
01:45 - I'm actually getting it completely down
01:47 - so there we go mine is in now and now
01:50 - that you have this plugged in correctly
01:51 - we're going to go ahead actually get on
01:54 - our Raspberry Pi and start using this
01:56 - camera alright so now let's start
01:58 - actually setting up the camera on the
01:59 - Raspberry Pi and taking some photo and
02:02 - video now I will warn you guys right now
02:04 - if you're not plugged in directly to
02:06 - your display so you're doing something
02:08 - like bien seeing into your Raspberry Pi
02:10 - which is what I'm actually doing right
02:12 - now
02:13 - which essentially means I'm just remote
02:14 - accessing my raspberry pi that's how I'm
02:16 - able to actually screen record here
02:18 - you're not going to be able to see the
02:20 - live feed of your camera what actually
02:22 - happens is when you do the live feed
02:24 - your raspberry try it your raspberry pi
02:27 - tries to spit that out to the actual
02:29 - display that's plugged into it so if
02:31 - your VN seed into it like I am right now
02:34 - like virtual network something whatever
02:36 - that means then you're not gonna be able
02:38 - to see the display so just make sure
02:40 - that you guys are actually plugged in
02:41 - like your keyboard and mouse is plugged
02:43 - in and you have a display plugged into
02:44 - this Raspberry Pi otherwise it's gonna
02:46 - be difficult to see and actually test if
02:48 - this is working so what I'm gonna do
02:50 - right now is just show you how to set up
02:52 - the camera so the first thing we want we
02:54 - want to do is actually just type rasp I
02:56 - - config and I believe before that we
02:59 - might have typed sudo now when we do
03:01 - that it should bring up something that
03:03 - looks like this and what we're gonna do
03:05 - is we're going to scroll down to
03:06 - interfacing options I just use the
03:08 - number or the arrow keys to do that hit
03:10 - enter I'm gonna go to camera now this
03:13 - should be showing up if this is not
03:15 - showing up this means that you actually
03:17 - haven't plugged in the camera correctly
03:19 - now after we do that we're gonna click
03:21 - enter and we're going to click yes to
03:24 - enable the camera now mine's already
03:26 - enabled so I don't have to do anything
03:28 - past this but you guys will likely have
03:30 - to restart your Raspberry Pi go for a
03:33 - reboot so I'm just gonna hit finish here
03:35 - and that's all we need to do to actually
03:36 - set up the camera and now what we can do
03:38 - is actually start working with it and
03:41 - recording some video and taking photos
03:43 - so I'm gonna close this and what I'm
03:45 - gonna do now is go to ideally so if I
03:48 - can find that under programming I'm
03:50 - going to go to file new once this
03:52 - eventually loads up and I'm just gonna
03:54 - start first of all taking photos and
03:57 - then taking videos so new file and what
04:00 - I'm gonna do is start by importing PI
04:01 - camera and importing the time module and
04:04 - then I'll show you how to take cameras
04:05 - or take photos so we're gonna say from
04:07 - PI camera imports PI camera just
04:13 - capitalizing that P and bc there and now
04:16 - what we're gonna do is import time so
04:18 - we're gonna say import time like that
04:21 - now we're going to define our camera so
04:23 - I'm gonna say camera
04:24 - people's PI camera camera like that and
04:30 - now we can actually start using the
04:31 - camera now whenever you use the PI
04:34 - camera what you actually need to do is
04:36 - you need to let it kind of warm up
04:38 - before you start taking a photo or video
04:40 - so what we're gonna do every time we
04:43 - start using this is we're gonna type
04:44 - camera does start underscore preview
04:49 - like this and then we're gonna sleep for
04:51 - two seconds around your time don't sleep
04:54 - too now this is the minimum amount of
04:56 - time that you can wait before you start
04:58 - taking photos with the camera now some
05:00 - of you will probably try to do this
05:01 - without sleeping and it may work for you
05:03 - but to make sure that you're not gonna
05:04 - run into any issues always do this and
05:06 - just make sure that you're sleeping two
05:08 - seconds after you start the preview now
05:11 - starting this preview will actually
05:13 - display the camera onto the screen for
05:15 - you now you're only gonna see this again
05:17 - if you're plugged directly into the
05:20 - display because it just takes over the
05:21 - entire display to show the camera so on
05:25 - my screen we're not gonna see the live
05:27 - display of the camera but if you guys
05:29 - are plugged in you will be able to see
05:30 - this edging to make that clear so I'm
05:32 - gonna save this now and I'm just gonna
05:33 - save this as let's say camera dot pi and
05:37 - we'll save this onto my desktop now it's
05:40 - important actually I already named one
05:41 - of these cameras so I'm just gonna say
05:43 - tutorial maybe dot pi it's important
05:46 - that you don't name this file PI camera
05:48 - if you do that you're gonna run into a
05:50 - bunch of issues because then this import
05:52 - here is not gonna work properly
05:53 - alright so now if we want to take a
05:55 - photo what we can do is just simply type
05:57 - camera dot capture like this and then we
06:02 - can simply type the name of the file we
06:04 - want to save this to and it will sit
06:05 - you'll just save it wherever our
06:08 - directory is or wherever our script is
06:10 - running so in this case I'm on my
06:11 - desktop so it's gonna save it on the
06:12 - desktop as well so I'm just gonna save
06:14 - this as test dot jpg the standard file
06:18 - format and now if I run this we should
06:21 - actually see that it saves that file and
06:23 - I will be able to open up the image for
06:25 - you guys but again if you're gonna be
06:27 - viewing this image sometimes it may only
06:29 - work if you're actually directly plugged
06:31 - in to the Raspberry Pi so I'm gonna run
06:33 - this with f5 wait are two seconds it's
06:36 - gonna snap a photo I'm just
06:38 - now the camera now hopefully this can
06:40 - photo turned out good for you guys and
06:42 - now we should see on our desktop we have
06:44 - an image called test JPEG you should be
06:46 - able to open this by just
06:47 - double-clicking let's see what we get
06:49 - for our photo and this one is a bit
06:50 - blurry cuz I was moving the camera but
06:52 - you guys can see that we get this photo
06:54 - now it actually saved in the resolution
06:56 - 1920 by 1080 so I can blow this up and
06:59 - you can see the beautiful photo of me
07:01 - nice and blurry while I move the camera
07:03 - but that's it for taking photos now if
07:06 - you want to change the resolution or you
07:08 - want to flip your camera around I'm
07:09 - gonna show you how to do that quickly so
07:11 - the first thing that we can do is we can
07:13 - set our camera resolution now the
07:15 - maximum camera resolution for this I
07:17 - believe is something like 2560 by 1440
07:21 - or something like that I don't know the
07:23 - exact resolution but I'm just gonna go
07:25 - ahead and set mine to 640 by 480 for
07:29 - right now just setting it at a low
07:31 - resolution cuz we're gonna start doing
07:32 - some video in just a second now if I
07:34 - want to flip my camera vertically so say
07:36 - I notice when I took my photo it was
07:38 - upside down to do that we just type it
07:40 - me flip so FL IP equals true and this is
07:45 - just gonna vertically flip our camera so
07:47 - now let's go ahead and do this again so
07:49 - f5 I'll look at my camera right this
07:51 - time and give a nice little wave big
07:54 - smile and then now if we run this and we
07:56 - look at test dot JPEG you can see a
07:58 - beautiful photo of me flipped correctly
08:00 - and a smaller resolution this time is
08:02 - 640 by 480 alright so that's it for
08:06 - taking photos pretty straightforward you
08:08 - can obviously put this into a while loop
08:10 - and take a bunch of photos or wait for
08:11 - some kind of motion and then take a
08:13 - photo you guys can play with that but
08:15 - now I'm going to show you how to take
08:16 - video so to take video is very similar
08:19 - except all we're gonna do to do this is
08:21 - do camera don't start underscore
08:24 - recording so start underscore recording
08:28 - like that now inside of here we're gonna
08:31 - put a file name again but the encoding
08:33 - on this has to be dot h.264 now this is
08:37 - a raw video recording which means that
08:40 - to open this is kind of a bit finicky
08:41 - but I'll show you guys that in just a
08:44 - second so I'm gonna record this under my
08:46 - underscore movie h.264 and then all I'm
08:50 - gonna do is simply sleep
08:52 - for as long as I want to wait for this
08:53 - recording so if I want to record for 10
08:55 - seconds I'll sleep for 10 seconds if I
08:57 - want to record for 5 seconds I'll do it
08:59 - for 5 and then once we're done we're
09:01 - gonna do camera dot stomp underscore
09:04 - recording like that and that'll stop
09:06 - recording our camera now that's actually
09:09 - it to saving this and recording a file
09:12 - essentially you're recording a video now
09:15 - the only thing is to view this video is
09:16 - a little bit finicky and I'm going to
09:18 - show you guys how to do that so let's
09:19 - run this first of all and let's see if
09:21 - this is actually working again my camera
09:23 - is down here so that's why it's kind of
09:25 - like coming up like this we'll wait that
09:27 - five seconds and get our movie recording
09:30 - and I'll show you guys how we can
09:31 - actually view this alright so now it's
09:33 - finished recording and if we want to
09:35 - view this what we can do is actually use
09:37 - something called omx player that should
09:39 - come with your Raspberry Pi so if you
09:42 - want to see if this first of all is on
09:43 - your Raspberry Pi what we're gonna do is
09:45 - just type omx player like this and then
09:48 - if it gives you no errors you have
09:50 - olmecs player and you're ready to move
09:51 - on otherwise you're gonna have to
09:52 - install it and I can't tell you how to
09:54 - do that because I don't know so you
09:55 - gonna have to look that up so what I'm
09:57 - gonna do next is just CD on to my
09:59 - desktop so that I can actually play this
10:02 - video so I'm gonna say o MX player and
10:04 - then I'm just gonna simply gonna type my
10:06 - underscore movie dot h.264 and hit enter
10:10 - now when you do this you should see the
10:13 - video pop up on your screen and you
10:15 - should be viewing it at about 25 fps now
10:18 - for me obviously since I'm BNC it into
10:20 - this and I'm not actually in the display
10:22 - I don't have an HDMI cable plugged into
10:24 - my Raspberry Pi you can see it's just
10:26 - the camera and the power cable I can't
10:27 - view it per few guys you should be able
10:30 - to so that is actually it for recording
10:32 - and taking video if you want to change
10:34 - the resolution just change this if you
10:36 - want to change the vertical flip you can
10:38 - do that you can also do a horizontal
10:40 - flip so camera dot each flip I believe
10:43 - is that one and set that equal to true
10:45 - or false accordingly and if that is how
10:47 - easy it is to record to video and to
10:50 - take photos with your Raspberry Pi
10:52 - camera in the next video I'm gonna show
10:54 - you guys how we can actually stream this
10:56 - tweet live feed so that we can view this
10:58 - from any other computer and that's gonna
11:00 - be kind of cool it's gonna be a bit of a
11:02 - longer video but we're gonna be using
11:03 - sockets
11:04 - and that'll be an interesting video as
11:06 - well so with that being said if you guys
11:08 - enjoyed the video please make sure you
11:09 - pay the like and subscribe and I will
11:10 - see you again

hey guys and welcome back to another Raspberry Pi tutorial so in today's video I'm gonna be talking about the Raspberry Pi camera module of v2 now what I'm gonna be doing is showing you as first of

guys how to do that so let's run this first of all and let's see if this is actually working again my camera is down here so that's why it's kind of like coming up like this we'll wait that five seconds and get our movie recording and I'll show you guys how we can actually view this alright so now it's finished recording and if we want to view this what we can do is actually use something called omx player that should come with your Raspberry Pi so if you want to see if this first of all is on your Raspberry Pi what we're gonna do is just type omx player like this and then if it gives you no errors you have olmecs player and you're ready to move on otherwise you're gonna have to install it and I can't tell you how to do that because I don't know so you gonna have to look that up so what I'm gonna do next is just CD on to my desktop so that I can actually play this video so I'm gonna say o MX player and then I'm just gonna simply gonna type my underscore movie dot h.264 and hit enter now when you do this you should see the video pop up on your screen and you should be viewing it at about 25 fps now for me obviously since I'm BNC it into this and I'm not actually in the display I don't have an HDMI cable plugged into my Raspberry Pi you can see it's just the camera and the power cable I can't view it per few guys you should be able to so that is actually it for recording and taking video if you want to change the resolution just change this if you want to change the vertical flip you can do that you can also do a horizontal flip so camera dot each flip I believe is that one and set that equal to true or false accordingly and if that is how easy it is to record to video and to take photos with your Raspberry Pi camera in the next video I'm gonna show you guys how we can actually stream this tweet live feed so that we can view this from any other computer and that's gonna be kind of cool it's gonna be a bit of a longer video but we're gonna be using sockets and that'll be an interesting video as well so with that being said if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you pay the like and subscribe and I will see you again
