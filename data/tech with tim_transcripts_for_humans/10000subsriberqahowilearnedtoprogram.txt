00:01 - [Music]
00:06 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:08 - video so I have to start off by just
00:10 - giving a massive thank you to everyone
00:12 - who's been subscribed to the channel and
00:14 - to everyone this helped me get to this
00:15 - point yesterday was officially the day
00:18 - that we hit 10,000 subscribers and I
00:20 - can't tell you guys how thrilled I am
00:22 - about done how long I've been waiting
00:24 - and trying to accomplish this goal so
00:26 - obviously a massive thank you to all of
00:28 - you guys I couldn't have done it without
00:29 - you and the amount of support that you
00:31 - guys showed me on this channel
00:32 - it's just unreal and it's the reason
00:34 - that I keep going and keep posting
00:35 - videos so before I get into this video
00:38 - I'm gonna be doing a Q&A I just want to
00:40 - talk about kind of what's going on for
00:42 - the next week or so so I'm gonna be
00:43 - really busy with school actually have
00:45 - three midterms coming up in a few days
00:47 - so it's unlikely that I'm gonna get to
00:49 - posting more than maybe one other video
00:52 - before those midterms on the weekend so
00:54 - I apologize in advance that there won't
00:56 - be many much tutorial content coming out
00:58 - but after that weekend I'm done with the
01:01 - busyness of school done midterm season
01:03 - or whatever you want to call it and then
01:04 - I'll be getting right back into regular
01:07 - uploads and we'll be getting right back
01:08 - on track so hopefully you guys can bear
01:10 - with me on that
01:11 - so starting this video I just want to
01:13 - say like you guys ask me a ton of
01:15 - questions and I get the same questions
01:17 - all the time so I'm gonna start
01:19 - responding to those ones and then I kind
01:20 - of go through some other questions that
01:22 - I get really commonly and just answer
01:24 - those for you so one of the first
01:26 - questions I get all the time it's really
01:28 - simple answer is how old are you now I
01:31 - could not tell you guys how many times I
01:33 - can almost a day I get this question at
01:35 - least once a day so the answer that is
01:37 - 18 and a bit more context 18 years old
01:41 - right and I'm in computer science first
01:44 - year at university because that's also
01:45 - another question that goes along with it
01:47 - are you in school are you doing this
01:48 - professionally what not so I'm by no
01:50 - means a professional programmer or
01:52 - computer scientist I am still learning
01:55 - just like you guys but I love to share
01:57 - my knowledge online and to help out
01:58 - people that were at some point in my
02:00 - position learning and getting better
02:01 - with computers and what okay so the next
02:04 - question is how many programming
02:06 - languages do you know and what is your
02:08 - favorite programming
02:10 - language now I used to know quite a few
02:13 - back when I was learning like when I was
02:14 - like 12 or 13 so I'll go through them
02:16 - quickly but right now the only ones I'm
02:18 - really comfortable programming in would
02:19 - be c-sharp Java and Python and then
02:22 - maybe a bit of Swift but essentially
02:24 - when I started I knew HTML CSS
02:27 - JavaScript PHP that was kind of like one
02:30 - stage of programming all the web
02:31 - development kind of stuff and then I
02:33 - moved into c-sharp where I just kind of
02:36 - did c-sharp for about a year and then I
02:38 - did Python and then a bit of Swift
02:41 - because I was working on some apps and
02:42 - then I did Python and now are sorry not
02:45 - Python Java which I'm doing for my
02:47 - computer science courses right now in
02:49 - school but Python is by far my favorite
02:51 - programming language it's super powerful
02:53 - and super simple and I can write scripts
02:55 - in Python faster than I can write them
02:57 - at anything else and in some cases
02:58 - they're even more effective and more
02:59 - efficient than other languages so that
03:01 - answers that question okay so another
03:03 - question that I get a amazing amount of
03:06 - times is how do I learn programming or I
03:09 - just started learning program and what
03:11 - are my next steps what should I do now
03:13 - I've said this a million times maybe not
03:16 - in the formal video of interesting
03:17 - comments but the number one thing to do
03:19 - is to program a lot of people get stuck
03:22 - up by trying to learn syntax and trying
03:24 - to learn like the formalities of a
03:26 - language before really working on any
03:28 - projects that is by no means what I did
03:31 - to learn programming I learned like the
03:33 - very basics just enough to the point
03:35 - where I was comfortable making my own
03:36 - project or my own program and then what
03:39 - I did is I just learned and you guys
03:41 - would see like on the stream for example
03:42 - that I did the 24 hour stream I didn't
03:45 - know how to do a lot of the stuff that I
03:46 - was doing I had some kind of an idea but
03:48 - what I was doing was I was looking it up
03:50 - I was asking for help going on the
03:52 - Internet and that's essentially the best
03:53 - way to learn is because when you're
03:55 - doing projects you're gonna find really
03:57 - quickly and things you understand and
03:59 - things you don't understand and then
04:00 - you're able to kind of look at the
04:02 - things that you're having trouble with
04:03 - learn those or you also run into issues
04:06 - that you never would have seen by simply
04:08 - reading let's say a book on programming
04:09 - or going to a website now if you're an
04:11 - absolute beginner obviously that can be
04:13 - kind of intimidating trying to just go
04:14 - work on a project so I definitely
04:16 - recommend you know checking out some
04:18 - YouTube videos or doing like maybe an
04:20 - online
04:21 - and just doing that for like a week or
04:23 - two in getting the basics of program
04:25 - understanding fundamentals and then
04:26 - start working on small projects maybe go
04:29 - back learn a bit more another small
04:31 - project and really project project
04:33 - project is all I have to say do your own
04:35 - thing code things that interest you
04:36 - because that is the best way to learn
04:38 - and that's what I've done and that's how
04:40 - I've gone to the point that I'm at right
04:42 - now okay so the next question this one
04:44 - isn't as commonly asked but I figured I
04:45 - answer because I think it's pretty
04:46 - interesting is what is the most
04:48 - difficult part of programming or of
04:50 - coding now obviously this is gonna vary
04:53 - depending on each person some people
04:54 - probably tell you to syntax I'm like
04:56 - really depends for me I would definitely
04:59 - say getting stuck on a problem and
05:02 - something especially that you think you
05:04 - should be able to do and I say this just
05:07 - because I recently did that 24-hour live
05:09 - stream you guys can check that out on
05:10 - the channel but I was realizing pretty
05:13 - quickly that the most frustrating part
05:15 - was when you run into a problem that
05:17 - just stumps you and you can't get past
05:19 - it and especially for me I'm a little
05:21 - bit selfish and I don't want to just
05:22 - move on I want to try to fix the problem
05:24 - and when you keep looking at the same
05:26 - problem for so long without having a
05:28 - fresh perspective on it it can be really
05:31 - frustrating and that's one of the things
05:32 - that I was getting frustrated with as
05:34 - well on the stream was I wasn't really
05:35 - making any progress for about an hour -
05:37 - I would just be stuck on the same
05:39 - problem and I wasn't moving anywhere I
05:41 - forgot two hours I essentially had done
05:43 - nothing except figured out why my code
05:45 - didn't work right so you could say
05:48 - that's something but I think that's
05:50 - maybe one of the hardest parts is going
05:52 - maybe days or hours without really
05:54 - getting anything done and just trying to
05:56 - figure things out and if you're not
05:57 - mentally strong I want to say um it is
06:01 - quite difficult to do and I mean I'm
06:03 - sure you guys probably ran into similar
06:04 - issues where you run into a bug that
06:06 - just really frustrates you and all you
06:08 - want to do is either fix it or just give
06:09 - up on it and that's one of the probably
06:11 - hardest parts of programming is dealing
06:13 - with running into issues where you think
06:16 - everything should be working but it's
06:17 - just not ok so now I'm just kind of
06:19 - taking questions from the live stream
06:20 - that I did a few days ago I just ask
06:22 - people like ask me a bunch of questions
06:23 - and I answered them on there but I'll
06:25 - answer them again here someone asked me
06:27 - what are my thoughts on my computer
06:28 - science classes are they difficult
06:30 - that's very hard to answer because it's
06:33 - going to depend
06:34 - some persons school school but for me
06:36 - personally my computer science classes
06:38 - are very straightforward they are
06:41 - getting a bit more complicated now like
06:43 - a few algorithms and data structures but
06:45 - nothing too advanced or that I'm not
06:47 - capable of handling
06:48 - I personally don't go to many computer
06:50 - science classes because I know most of
06:52 - the concepts they're teaching and I find
06:55 - it's a lot better for me when I'm
06:56 - practicing those concepts to just be at
06:58 - home and you know work on what I need to
07:00 - work on rather than listening to a prof.
07:02 - and maybe he's trying to teach it in a
07:05 - way where other people don't know the
07:06 - concepts already whereas I'm just kind
07:07 - of reinforcing my learning so I would
07:09 - say they're very straightforward at
07:11 - least for first year my introduction of
07:13 - computing class I had last semester was
07:14 - just Python super straightforward like
07:17 - videos on my channel are way more
07:18 - advanced and a lot of stuff they did on
07:20 - there
07:20 - and now the wouldn't call it computing 2
07:23 - which is Java is a bit more advanced but
07:25 - nothing too complicated we're just
07:26 - moving into stacks right now so we did
07:28 - like Q based algorithms now we're doing
07:29 - stacks and I forget what else we're
07:32 - doing for the rest of the semester but
07:33 - pretty straightforward okay so next
07:35 - question and I'm kind of just
07:36 - formulating this in a general question
07:38 - that I get Ansel asked the lawn is are
07:40 - you software developer do you do this
07:43 - for a living is YouTube like a full-time
07:45 - gig for you most of you should know this
07:48 - is not by any means a full-time gig I'm
07:50 - by no means a software developer some of
07:52 - you might try to argue that but I don't
07:54 - consider myself a software developer or
07:56 - like a professional programmer it's just
07:57 - something I like to do and have a
07:59 - passion for YouTube is not a full-time
08:02 - thing whatsoever I'm a full-time student
08:04 - that is my priority but YouTube is
08:08 - something that I do as a hobby and I
08:10 - kind of consider like a part of my day
08:12 - now you know what I mean like when I
08:13 - wake up part of my day is slaughtered
08:15 - doing YouTube part of its to school part
08:17 - of its going to class so I just love
08:19 - doing YouTube videos I wouldn't be doing
08:21 - it if I didn't love it you guys know
08:23 - that this doesn't make me that much
08:24 - money and I don't do it obviously for
08:27 - the money that being said though if you
08:30 - guys would like to help me out and to
08:33 - support the channel you guys could go to
08:34 - my patreon link in the description and
08:36 - by simply just donating like a dollar a
08:38 - month that really shows me like a
08:39 - tremendous amount of support and if you
08:42 - guys can afford then you get a lot of
08:43 - value out of my content I would really
08:45 - appreciate that okay guys so I'm gonna
08:47 - start wrapping up the video now
08:48 - obviously I want to give another massive
08:50 - thank you to everyone that's helped me
08:52 - out everyone that subscribed to the
08:53 - channel that comments that likes it
08:55 - really does mean the world to me this is
08:57 - a massive accomplishment for me and I'm
09:00 - really excited to be at this number but
09:01 - I do have to say this is just the
09:03 - beginning of tech with Tim I have so
09:05 - many new plans so many things planned
09:07 - for the future and I'm really excited to
09:09 - see where the channel goes and I think
09:10 - you guys should be as well not being
09:12 - said quick kind of just what's gonna be
09:14 - going on in the future in some videos
09:16 - I'm gonna be trying I want to know your
09:17 - feedback on them essentially you might
09:18 - notice I'm actually recording with a
09:20 - brand new camera right now so yesterday
09:22 - right when I hit 10k I actually went
09:25 - over to the store and I decided to buy
09:26 - myself a brand new camera and lens I'll
09:29 - put like the specs for it in the
09:30 - description if you care to see what it
09:31 - is but essentially this means now that I
09:34 - have a high quality like recording thing
09:36 - that I like camera I can actually do
09:39 - videos where I'm recording more of
09:40 - myself so like face to face videos like
09:42 - this I can also do videos record like my
09:45 - PC setup or like physical things in real
09:48 - life like maybe a day in the life so let
09:50 - me know what you guys think about that
09:51 - and if there's any videos that you'd
09:53 - specifically like to see that maybe
09:54 - aren't tutorial content and maybe more
09:56 - about me or my life or whatnot I do want
09:59 - to try to do like maybe a video using
10:01 - this camera a week that's kind of the
10:03 - goal right now we'll see where it takes
10:05 - us and what it looks like with that
10:07 - being said I'm gonna wrap up the video
10:09 - here another massive thank you to
10:11 - everyone and I will see you guys again
10:13 - in the next video
10:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to another video so I have to start off by just giving a massive thank you to everyone who's been subscribed to the channel and to everyone this helped me get to this point yesterday was officially the day that we hit 10,000 subscribers and I can't tell you guys how thrilled I am about done how long I've been waiting and trying to accomplish this goal so obviously a massive thank you to all of you guys I couldn't have done it without you and the amount of support that you guys showed me on this channel it's just unreal and it's the reason that I keep going and keep posting videos so before I get into this video I'm gonna be doing a Q&A I just want to talk about kind of what's going on for the next week or so so I'm gonna be really busy with school actually have three midterms coming up in a few days so it's unlikely that I'm gonna get to posting more than maybe one other video before those midterms on the weekend so I apologize in advance that there won't be many much tutorial content coming out but after that weekend I'm done with the busyness of school done midterm season or whatever you want to call it and then I'll be getting right back into regular uploads and we'll be getting right back on track so hopefully you guys can bear with me on that so starting this video I just want to say like you guys ask me a ton of questions and I get the same questions all the time so I'm gonna start responding to those ones and then I kind of go through some other questions that I get really commonly and just answer those for you so one of the first questions I get all the time it's really simple answer is how old are you now I could not tell you guys how many times I can almost a day I get this question at least once a day so the answer that is 18 and a bit more context 18 years old right and I'm in computer science first year at university because that's also another question that goes along with it are you in school are you doing this professionally what not so I'm by no means a professional programmer or computer scientist I am still learning just like you guys but I love to share my knowledge online and to help out people that were at some point in my position learning and getting better with computers and what okay so the next question is how many programming languages do you know and what is your favorite programming language now I used to know quite a few back when I was learning like when I was like 12 or 13 so I'll go through them quickly but right now the only ones I'm really comfortable programming in would be csharp Java and Python and then maybe a bit of Swift but essentially when I started I knew HTML CSS JavaScript PHP that was kind of like one stage of programming all the web development kind of stuff and then I moved into csharp where I just kind of did csharp for about a year and then I did Python and then a bit of Swift because I was working on some apps and then I did Python and now are sorry not Python Java which I'm doing for my computer science courses right now in school but Python is by far my favorite programming language it's super powerful and super simple and I can write scripts in Python faster than I can write them at anything else and in some cases they're even more effective and more efficient than other languages so that answers that question okay so another question that I get a amazing amount of times is how do I learn programming or I just started learning program and what are my next steps what should I do now I've said this a million times maybe not in the formal video of interesting comments but the number one thing to do is to program a lot of people get stuck up by trying to learn syntax and trying to learn like the formalities of a language before really working on any projects that is by no means what I did to learn programming I learned like the very basics just enough to the point where I was comfortable making my own project or my

gonna find really quickly and things you understand and things you don't understand and then you're able to kind of look at the things that you're having trouble with learn those or you also run into

things that interest you because that is the best way to learn and that's what I've done and that's how I've gone to the point that I'm at right now okay so the next question this one isn't as commonly asked but I figured I answer because I think it's pretty interesting is what is the most difficult part of programming or of coding now obviously this is gonna vary depending on each person some people probably tell you to syntax I'm like really depends for me I would definitely say getting stuck on a problem and something especially that you think you should be able to do and I say this

not mentally strong I want to say um it is quite difficult to do and I mean I'm sure you guys probably ran into similar issues where you run into a bug that just really frustrates you and all you want to do is either fix it or just give up on it and that's one of the probably hardest parts of programming is dealing with running into issues where you think everything should be working but it's just not ok so now I'm just kind of taking questions from the live stream that I did a few days ago I just ask people like ask me a bunch of questions and I answered them on there but I'll answer them
