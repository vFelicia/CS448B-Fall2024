00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video I'm gonna be sharing with you
00:03 - my tech slash programming setup and why
00:06 - I've invested so much money into
00:08 - creating this now personally I work for
00:11 - anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day in
00:13 - this chair sitting at this computer so
00:15 - for me this setup better be pleasant and
00:17 - it better be a place that I am
00:19 - comfortable sitting down in for long
00:20 - periods of time throughout this video
00:22 - I'm gonna be showing you guys all the
00:23 - different equipment I have discussing
00:25 - why I've purchased that specific item as
00:27 - well as giving you some tips for when
00:29 - you're building your programming setup a
00:31 - few things you may want to look out for
00:33 - and a few items that you need to have so
00:35 - with that being said let's get into the
00:36 - video and talk about my programming and
00:38 - tech setup so in my opinion there are
00:40 - five essential items that everyone needs
00:42 - when setting up a programming setup now
00:45 - these are the items that I think you
00:46 - should be buying first that should have
00:48 - the largest budget allocated to them
00:50 - there's something that you absolutely
00:51 - cannot cheap out on now I'm gonna
00:53 - discuss those in just a second but I
00:55 - want to quickly go on a little tangent
00:56 - here and talk about software now a lot
00:59 - of people think that having a nice setup
01:00 - is all about hardware and that is you
01:03 - know partially true you want to have a
01:04 - really good clean looking setup with the
01:06 - best tech and all of that but having
01:08 - good software and configuring your
01:10 - system properly is very important as
01:12 - well and this leads me into actually the
01:14 - sponsor of today's video which is kite
01:16 - now kite is a free plugin for your IDE
01:18 - or text editor uses machine learning to
01:20 - give you the best possible completions
01:22 - for your Python code it's capable of
01:24 - completing entire lines entire function
01:26 - calls and it ranks all of its
01:28 - completions by relevance so you get
01:29 - shown the best ones first even as
01:31 - another feature called intelligence
01:33 - snippets which allows you to quickly tab
01:34 - through the different options and choose
01:36 - which completion you'd like one of the
01:38 - coolest features that comes with kite is
01:39 - called co-pilot now what code pilot does
01:41 - this provide one-click documentation it
01:44 - shows you information about modules
01:45 - classes methods and functions based on
01:48 - your cursor location now the best part
01:50 - of kite is that it's free and you can
01:51 - download it at the link below
01:53 - alright so without further ado let's
01:55 - talk about my five essential items for a
01:58 - programming setup now the first item
02:00 - that I'm going to talk about is the
02:01 - computer now this might be kind of
02:03 - obvious to you guys but personally I
02:05 - like working on a desktop computer as
02:07 - you can see behind me but I do actually
02:08 - have two laptops now I recommend that if
02:11 - you have the budget to and if you're
02:13 - to be working mostly from home you
02:15 - invest in a nice desktop machine now the
02:17 - reason I like a desktop machine is
02:19 - personally because I like to be able to
02:20 - have the keyboard wherever I'd like I
02:22 - like to have the monitors kind of spread
02:24 - out nice on my desk and I do actually
02:25 - like the aesthetic of my computer I'm
02:27 - not sure if you guys see it I'll try to
02:29 - do like a few little video clips in
02:30 - between here so you get an idea of what
02:32 - it looks like but this is a custom-built
02:33 - machine it was about twenty-five
02:35 - twenty-six hundred dollars when I built
02:37 - it back in 2017 and it's a top of the
02:40 - end computer you know it's nothing crazy
02:42 - but it gets the job done and you need to
02:44 - definitely have a fast machine that you
02:46 - like working with when you're setting up
02:47 - a programming setup so whether that's
02:49 - gonna be a laptop or a desktop I'm not
02:51 - going to judge you too much if you
02:52 - decide on a laptop make sure you have a
02:54 - nice machine make sure you like it and
02:56 - make sure when you're using it it's a
02:57 - pleasant experience now the next most
03:00 - important item here is the keyboard now
03:03 - if you're working on a desk surface at
03:05 - home and you have a laptop I'd highly
03:07 - recommend you buy yourself a very nice
03:09 - keyboard now personally I used to use a
03:11 - cherry MX red keyboard which was okay
03:14 - but as soon as I bought this new
03:16 - keyboard which was about 250 canadian
03:19 - dollars i saw a massive increase in my
03:21 - efficiency and just my desire to want to
03:23 - type so personally this keeper that you
03:25 - guys are looking at now has brown
03:26 - switches in it it's a desk that's Keith
03:29 - or Q something I'll try to put the model
03:32 - up somewhere and it's just a very very
03:34 - nice keyboard I actually try to find
03:36 - excuses to type on it because I love it
03:38 - so much now having a nice keyboard is
03:40 - really important as well because
03:41 - obviously that's what you're gonna be
03:42 - using the most while you're programming
03:44 - so just making sure that you know you're
03:46 - pleasant with that you'd like it and
03:47 - you're comfortable with the keyboard
03:48 - that you have now the next most
03:50 - important item and this might come as a
03:52 - surprise is your chair
03:54 - now this is my personal opinion but I
03:56 - used to work in a metal back chair just
03:58 - a really crappy chair and it was
04:00 - absolutely horrible not only did my back
04:02 - hurt but just I didn't want to sit in it
04:04 - I'd put a pillow behind it so it was
04:06 - nicer so the first thing I did when I
04:08 - got back home from the summer last year
04:09 - which is where I had that chair was in
04:11 - my university residence I bought myself
04:13 - the nicest most expensive chair I could
04:16 - find
04:17 - now this chair right here this is what
04:18 - are you looking at I'll put up something
04:20 - kind of talking about it it's very
04:22 - adjustable it has a nice high back and
04:24 - it has a lumbar support which is what I
04:26 - kind of look
04:26 - or in a chair I love sitting in this
04:28 - chair it's extremely comfortable and
04:30 - even sometimes I find myself you know
04:32 - kind of falling is sleeping it when I'm
04:33 - reclining it too far back
04:35 - so obviously the chair is important
04:36 - something to consider and I would highly
04:38 - recommend that if you have a limited
04:40 - budget you allocate a lot of it to your
04:42 - chair because this is where you're gonna
04:43 - be sitting for a large majority of time
04:46 - the next most important item in my setup
04:48 - is going to be the monitors now the two
04:51 - monitors that I have here are fairly
04:53 - expensive they're not crazy I have a 27
04:55 - inch 4k monitor LG I think it was about
04:58 - $400 and then I have a 24 inch MSI
05:02 - monitor that's actually a gaming monitor
05:04 - that was about $300 so didn't go all out
05:07 - with the monitors but I do really like
05:09 - the 27-inch display especially when
05:11 - you're programming because gonna have
05:12 - two windows up side by side and I would
05:14 - definitely say that a second monitor is
05:16 - necessary to get work done efficiently I
05:19 - personally have a very hard time working
05:21 - on laptops because I'm so used to
05:23 - working with two monitors and I just
05:24 - want to be dragging things back and
05:26 - forth between my screens and being able
05:27 - to reference things at the same time and
05:29 - on those smaller screens it's harder to
05:31 - split the windows up and down so even if
05:33 - you're using a laptop I would highly
05:35 - recommend that you consider buying a 24
05:37 - a 27-inch monitor as an extension to
05:40 - that or even you know just using the
05:42 - laptop when you're at home plugging it
05:43 - into that monitor and just using the
05:45 - monitor solely I think it's very
05:46 - important to have more than two screens
05:48 - and it definitely definitely increases
05:50 - your in fish efficiency a ton and the
05:53 - last item on my list for some of the
05:55 - essential things in our programming
05:56 - setup is going to be lighting now this
05:59 - might surprise some of you but
06:01 - personally I've never really worked in a
06:03 - well-lit environment until this year and
06:06 - recently I was fortunate enough to have
06:08 - Venky you actually send me what this
06:10 - year eating lamp is and this screen bar
06:12 - plus here which have actually saved me
06:14 - so much this lighting is absolutely
06:18 - phenomenal I'm not actually getting paid
06:19 - to say this I've already done a review
06:21 - video on these products if you want to
06:22 - see them but genuinely they make a world
06:25 - of a difference these specific lamps are
06:27 - actually designed to make it so it's
06:29 - easier to look at your monitor screen
06:31 - and to be honest with you when I first
06:32 - heard this I was kind of like okay
06:33 - whatever it's just a marketing scam but
06:35 - after using this lamp for I think
06:37 - probably about three or four months I
06:38 - can say this makes a
06:40 - massive difference and it's just really
06:42 - nice to have some nice lighting at my
06:44 - desk personally what I usually do is
06:46 - actually turn all the lights off on in
06:48 - my room and just put on this screen bar
06:51 - plus light which is kind of on top of
06:52 - the monitor here and this Big Ben QE
06:54 - reading lamp and what's really nice
06:56 - about this lamp is that it can swing
06:58 - outwards and actually covered the whole
07:00 - surface of my desk so as a student when
07:02 - I'm writing a lot and doing stuff on my
07:04 - desk that's not necessarily using my
07:06 - computer I can really nicely swivel that
07:08 - lamp so I get direct lighting over
07:09 - exactly what I'm doing which makes it
07:11 - nice much nicer for reading and writing
07:13 - and just genuinely doing everything and
07:16 - I think it's very important to consider
07:17 - the lighting that you have whether
07:19 - that's buying a nice lamp or making sure
07:21 - that you have sufficient lighting just
07:22 - from pot lights or whatever it is it's
07:24 - very important and it's definitely gonna
07:26 - save your eyes and just make it much
07:28 - more comfortable to work at your desk
07:29 - all right so now I'm gonna walk you guys
07:31 - through some of the other miscellaneous
07:32 - items in my setup now I have quite a few
07:35 - so I'll just kind of quickly go through
07:36 - a bunch of them and show you know why I
07:38 - kind of have those items alright so I
07:41 - want to start by showing us something
07:42 - which is really cool which is actually
07:43 - this mousepad now this mouse pad has
07:45 - shortcuts for subline text on it which
07:47 - is actually my favorite text editor you
07:49 - can see it shows sub-line up there and
07:51 - it's kind of cool I don't know it's just
07:52 - like you know your standard mousepad
07:53 - I'll leave it on my desk and then if I
07:55 - need to quickly look up some of the
07:57 - shortcuts for my editor I'll just do it
07:59 - on this now they also have some options
08:01 - for vs code and for other popular
08:03 - editors they have Adam I think and all
08:05 - those so if you guys want one of these
08:06 - mouse pads actually teamed up with the
08:08 - guy who makes these and he's giving you
08:10 - guys I think like 10% off so I'll leave
08:12 - a link in the description if you're
08:13 - interested in that now here you can see
08:15 - I actually have a wireless charger which
08:17 - is pretty important because this is
08:18 - usually where I'll charge my phone or my
08:20 - air pods and then you know a few other
08:23 - things like I have a speaker down here
08:25 - if I could show that just a beats pill
08:27 - actually a fairly expensive speaker but
08:29 - I really like listening to music when I
08:31 - program so that's pretty important to me
08:33 - SteelSeries mouse I mean pretty standard
08:35 - nothing too special about that we've got
08:37 - a blue Yeti microphone obviously that's
08:39 - what I used to record most of my YouTube
08:41 - videos this is a quick kind of walk
08:44 - around of my computer it's pretty hard
08:46 - to see because it's tempered glass on
08:47 - four sides but this is like one of the
08:50 - corsair cases pretty nice pretty nice
08:53 - cable man
08:54 - mints are right on that and then what
08:56 - else do I have well I have this which
08:58 - controls the RGB under my desk so I
09:01 - could turn that off or I can turn that
09:03 - back on few other random things like a
09:05 - Nvidia micro board is right there I also
09:08 - have this little personal fan which is
09:10 - kind of nice because it actually will
09:11 - cool down the room so you can actually
09:12 - take this and fill it up with water and
09:15 - it's pretty cool
09:16 - from a company called Eva pool actually
09:18 - send it to me for free I'll leave a link
09:20 - to their thing as well in case you guys
09:21 - are interested in that and then my iPad
09:23 - now this is where I actually just leave
09:25 - my live subscriber count' nothing too
09:28 - special a lot of people find it funny
09:29 - that I have an entire iPad just for that
09:31 - but I got that iPad for free so that's
09:33 - why I'm doing that another cool thing is
09:36 - my drawing tablets now you guys might
09:38 - see me use this in some videos I
09:40 - actually find it really useful if I'm
09:41 - just trying to sketch some stuff because
09:43 - I don't usually like to pull out paper
09:45 - I'll just you know plug that in quickly
09:47 - and I can do a quick sketch and save
09:48 - that on my computer so yeah I mean those
09:51 - are kind of the main items in my
09:53 - programming setup another important one
09:56 - which will grab here quickly is actually
09:58 - this which is my fidget spinner now a
10:00 - lot of people make fun of me for having
10:02 - this but I actually just like using it
10:04 - just spinning it around you know it's
10:06 - something nice and I would actually
10:07 - encourage you guys to get one if you're
10:08 - a programmer because a lot of times and
10:10 - I'm just kind of stuck in deep thought
10:11 - I'll just kind of sit there and spin
10:12 - around and it's a nice kind of way to
10:14 - maybe distract myself a little bit so I
10:17 - was gonna end the video there but I just
10:18 - want to show you guys something that's
10:20 - actually really important to me and it's
10:21 - kind of the main way that I stay
10:23 - organized and stay focused now I
10:25 - actually have these boards in my room
10:27 - and I will kind of drag them to you here
10:29 - and this is where I pretty much write
10:31 - down everything that I need to do and
10:33 - just plan out my days and you know what
10:35 - needs to get done
10:36 - now sometimes you know I have some
10:38 - colored markers here so all like star
10:39 - some things that I want to do but
10:41 - essentially this is a really nice way
10:42 - for me to just kind of keep myself
10:44 - accountable for what it is that I
10:46 - actually need to finish and get a
10:47 - visualization of how much I need to do
10:50 - and I think that's pretty important and
10:51 - if you guys can actually have a calendar
10:53 - write down everything you need to do and
10:54 - get that organized in a physical
10:56 - location to me it really helps to be
10:58 - able to you know knock something off the
10:59 - list and stay motivated and keep getting
11:01 - through all of that so with that being
11:03 - said that has kind of been it for my
11:05 - programming
11:06 - I'd love to know your thoughts in the
11:07 - comments down below if you guys have any
11:09 - recommendations for anything I could add
11:10 - to this to make it even better
11:11 - definitely let me know and with that
11:13 - being said I will see you guys in
11:15 - another video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you my tech slash programming setup and why I've invested so much money into creating this now personally I work for anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day in this chair sitting at this computer so for me this setup better be pleasant and it better be a place that I am comfortable sitting down in for long periods of time throughout this video I'm gonna be showing you guys all the different equipment I have discussing why I've purchased that specific item as well as giving you some tips for when you're building your programming setup a few things you may want to look out for and a few items that you need to have so with that being said let's get into the video and talk about my programming and tech setup so in my opinion there are five essential items that everyone needs when setting up a programming setup now these are the items that I think you should be buying first that should have the largest budget allocated to them there's something that you absolutely cannot cheap out on now I'm gonna discuss those in just a second but I want to quickly go on a little tangent here and talk about software now a lot of people think that having a nice setup is all about hardware and that is you know partially true you want to have a really good clean looking setup with the best tech and all of that but having good software and configuring your system properly is very important as well and this leads me into actually the sponsor of today's video which is kite now kite is a free plugin for your IDE or text editor uses machine learning to give you the best possible completions for your Python code it's capable of completing entire lines entire function calls and it ranks all of its completions by relevance so you get shown the best ones first even as another feature called intelligence snippets which allows you to quickly tab through the different options and choose which completion you'd like one of the coolest features that comes with kite is called copilot now what code pilot does this provide oneclick documentation it shows you information about modules classes methods and functions based on your cursor location now the best part of kite is that it's free and you can download it at the link below alright so without further ado let's talk about my five essential items for a programming setup now the first item that I'm going to talk about is the computer now this might be kind of obvious to you guys but personally I like working on a desktop computer as you can see behind me but I do actually have two laptops now I recommend that if you have the budget to and if you're to be working mostly from home you invest in a nice desktop machine now the reason I like a desktop machine is personally because I like to be able to have the keyboard wherever I'd like I like to have the monitors kind of spread out nice on my desk and I do actually like the aesthetic of my computer I'm not sure if you guys see it I'll try to do like a few little video clips in between here so you get an idea of what it looks like but this is a custombuilt machine it was about twentyfive twentysix hundred dollars when I built it back in 2017 and it's a top of the end computer you know it's nothing crazy but it gets the job done and you need to definitely have a fast machine that you like working with when you're setting up a programming setup so whether that's gonna be a laptop or a desktop I'm not going to judge you too much if you decide on a laptop make sure you have a nice machine make sure you like it and make sure when you're using it it's a pleasant experience now the next most important item here is the keyboard now if you're working on a desk surface at home and you have a laptop I'd highly recommend you buy yourself a very nice keyboard now personally I used to use a cherry MX red keyboard which was okay but as soon as I bought this new keyboard which was about 250 canadian dollars i saw a massive increase in my efficiency and just my desire to want to type so personally this keeper that you guys are looking at now has brown switches in it it's a desk that's Keith or Q something I'll try to put the model up somewhere and it's just a very very nice keyboard I actually try to find excuses to type on it because I love it so much now having a nice keyboard is really important as well because obviously that's what you're gonna be using the most while you're programming so just making sure that you know you're pleasant with that you'd like it and you're comfortable with the keyboard that you have now the next most important item and this might come as a surprise is your chair now this is my personal opinion but I used to work in a metal back chair just a really crappy chair and it was absolutely horrible not only did my back hurt but just I didn't want to sit in it I'd put a pillow behind it so it was nicer so the first thing I did when I got back home from the summer last year which is where I had that chair was in my university residence I bought myself the nicest most expensive chair I could find now this chair right here this is what are you looking at I'll put up something kind of talking about it it's very adjustable it has a nice high back and it has a lumbar support which is what I kind of look or in a chair I love sitting in this chair it's extremely comfortable and even sometimes I find myself you know kind of falling is sleeping it when I'm reclining it too far back so obviously the chair is important something to consider and I would highly recommend that if you have a limited budget you allocate a lot of it to your chair because this is where you're gonna be sitting for a large majority of time the next most important item in my setup is going to be the monitors now the two monitors that I have here are fairly expensive they're not crazy I have a 27 inch 4k monitor LG I think it was about $400 and then I have a 24 inch MSI monitor that's actually a gaming monitor that was about $300 so didn't go all out with the monitors but I do really like the 27inch display especially when you're programming because gonna have two windows up side by side and I would definitely say that a second monitor is necessary to get work done efficiently I personally have a very hard time working on laptops because I'm so used to working with two monitors and I just want to be dragging things back and forth between my screens and being able to reference things at the same time and on those smaller screens it's harder to split the windows up and down so even if you're using a laptop I would highly recommend that you consider buying a 24 a 27inch monitor as an extension to that or even you know just using the laptop when you're at home plugging it into that monitor and just using the monitor solely I think it's very important to have more than two screens and it definitely definitely increases your in fish efficiency a ton and the last item on my list for some of the essential things in our programming setup is going to be lighting now this might surprise some of you but personally I've never really worked in a welllit environment until this year and recently I was fortunate enough to have Venky you actually send me what this year eating lamp is and this screen bar plus here which have actually saved me so much this lighting is absolutely phenomenal I'm not actually getting paid to say this I've already done a review video on these products if you want to see them but genuinely they make a world of a difference these specific lamps are actually designed to make it so it's easier to look at your monitor screen and to be honest with you when I first

gonna walk you guys through some of the other miscellaneous items in my setup now I have quite a few so I'll just kind of quickly go through a bunch of them and show you know why I kind of have those items alright so I want to start by showing us something which is really cool which is actually this mousepad now this mouse pad has shortcuts for subline text on it which is actually my favorite text editor you can see it shows subline up there and it's kind of cool I don't know it's just like you know your standard mousepad I'll leave it on my desk and then if I need to quickly look up some of the shortcuts for my editor I'll just do it on this now they also have some options for vs code and for other popular editors they have Adam I think and all those so if you guys want one of these mouse pads actually teamed up with the guy who makes these and he's giving you guys I think like 10% off so I'll leave a link in the description if you're interested in that now here you can see I actually have a wireless charger which is pretty important because this is usually where I'll charge my phone or my air pods and then you know a few other things like I have a speaker down here if I could show that just a beats pill actually a fairly expensive speaker but I really like listening to music when I program so that's pretty important to me SteelSeries mouse I mean pretty standard nothing too special about that we've got a blue Yeti microphone obviously that's what I used to record most of my YouTube videos this is a quick kind of walk around of my computer it's pretty hard to see because it's tempered glass on four sides but this is like one of the corsair cases pretty nice pretty nice cable man mints are right on that and then what else do I have well I have this which controls the RGB under my desk so I could turn that off or I can turn that back on few other random things like a Nvidia micro board is right there I also have this little personal fan which is kind of nice because it actually will cool down the room so you can actually take this and fill it up with water and it's pretty cool from a company called Eva pool actually send it to me for free I'll leave a link to their thing as well in case you guys are interested in that and then my iPad now this is where I actually just leave my live subscriber count' nothing too special a lot of people find it funny that I have an entire iPad just for that but I got that iPad for free so that's why I'm doing that another cool thing is my drawing tablets now you guys might see me use this in some videos I actually find it really useful if I'm just trying to sketch some stuff because I don't usually like to pull out paper I'll just you know plug that in quickly and I can do a quick sketch and save that on my computer so yeah I mean those are kind of the main items in my programming setup another important one which will grab here quickly is actually this which is my fidget spinner now a lot of people make fun of me for having this but I actually just like using it just spinning it around you know it's something nice and I would actually encourage you guys to get one if you're a programmer because a lot of times and I'm just kind of stuck in deep thought I'll just kind of sit there and spin around and it's a nice kind of way to maybe distract myself a little bit so I was gonna end the video there but I just want to show you guys something that's actually really important to me and it's kind of the main way that I stay organized and stay focused now I actually have these boards in my room and I will kind of drag them to you here and this is where I pretty much write down everything that I need to do and just plan out my days and you know what needs to get done now sometimes you know I have some colored markers here so all like star some things that I want to do but essentially this is a really nice way for me to just kind of keep myself accountable for what it is that I actually need to finish and get a visualization of how much I need to do and I think that's pretty important and if you guys can actually have a calendar write down everything you need to do and get that organized in a physical location to me it really helps to be able to you know knock something off the list and stay motivated and keep getting through all of that so with that being said that has kind of been it for my programming I'd love to know your thoughts in the comments down below if you guys have any recommendations for anything I could add to this to make it even better definitely let me know and with that being said I will see you guys in another video
