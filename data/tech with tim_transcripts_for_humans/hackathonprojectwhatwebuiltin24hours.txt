00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back now
00:02 - some of you might have noticed that
00:03 - wasn't super active the past couple of
00:05 - days on YouTube and that's because there
00:06 - was actually attending a hackathon now
00:08 - what I'm going to be doing in this video
00:10 - is discussing what I built at the
00:11 - hackathon why it was such an awesome
00:13 - event and kind of walking you guys
00:14 - through the story of how we ended up
00:16 - getting to where we went now if you
00:18 - haven't heard of a hackathon I'm gonna
00:19 - briefly introduce you to what kind of
00:21 - the concept an idea is but I would
00:23 - definitely highly recommend that any of
00:25 - you if you have the opportunity to go do
00:26 - attend one as it is a really cool
00:28 - experience
00:29 - so the hackathon that I went to is
00:31 - actually in Montreal at Concordia
00:32 - University now this was a really awesome
00:35 - event it was massive there was about 700
00:38 - or 800 people actually there which broke
00:40 - down into about close to 150 teams of
00:43 - four people now essentially what
00:45 - hackathon is is a 24 hour or 36 or some
00:48 - duration long event where you just build
00:50 - a hack now a hack could be something
00:52 - Hardware related it could be something
00:54 - software related but they all follow a
00:56 - kind of theme now after this event I
00:58 - believe there was something around 25
01:00 - different sponsors and there was about
01:02 - 12 different sponsored challenges now
01:05 - what these challenges are are large
01:06 - sponsors like we had sponsors like TD
01:09 - and Sun Life and a bunch of other
01:11 - massive tech companies like CGI and I'll
01:13 - name a few other ones later it will pick
01:15 - some something that they want you to
01:17 - build so let's say hey use our TD
01:19 - insurance API and build an app that you
01:22 - know does this with it or does that with
01:24 - it so you can decide to compete in these
01:26 - different challenges and then if you win
01:27 - you'll get different prizes so I think
01:29 - one of the better prizes I noticed was
01:31 - an oculus rift and that was given to
01:33 - every single person of the winning team
01:35 - and I believe that was from I don't
01:37 - actually know the company that sponsored
01:39 - it but it was like an augmented reality
01:40 - challenge where you had to build some AR
01:42 - game or some augmented reality
01:44 - application so there's a lot of cool
01:46 - stuff there I know what RS they had like
01:48 - a Unity game development one which is
01:50 - really interesting in the project we
01:51 - actually decided to build with something
01:53 - to do with called the octave music API
01:55 - now you probably haven't heard of this
01:57 - company as I haven't but their challenge
02:00 - was build something with our music API
02:02 - so that's what we decided to do so
02:04 - anyways that's enough about what
02:05 - hackathon is and kind of how they work
02:07 - now let's talk about my adventure to and
02:09 - from this hackathon and how we built the
02:11 - application that we did
02:13 - right so I'm just gonna kind of walk you
02:14 - guys through the itinerary for this
02:15 - hackathon
02:16 - what happened through it a little bit of
02:18 - story of how we built our application so
02:20 - I'm gonna start from actually midnight
02:22 - the day before the hackathon so this
02:24 - would have been I guess Friday night so
02:26 - since our bus actually left to go to
02:28 - Montreal at 3:30 in the morning we kind
02:30 - of decided that we weren't gonna go to
02:31 - bed the night before we're gonna sleep
02:33 - the entire day and then we were gonna
02:34 - stay up until the bus so maybe from like
02:36 - 9 p.m. until when the bus arrived and
02:39 - that would be fine
02:40 - so that's what we decided to do maybe a
02:41 - bit of a mistake but anyways we went to
02:43 - one of our other guys on the teams house
02:44 - and we stayed there and just kind of got
02:46 - to know each other a bit better because
02:48 - some of us hadn't worked together before
02:49 - like I didn't know to the teammates that
02:51 - were on our team and we looked at all of
02:53 - the sponsored prizes and all the
02:56 - different companies that were gonna be
02:57 - there
02:57 - so this is where we actually decided our
02:59 - idea which was gonna be to build this
03:01 - music player we had a whole bunch of
03:04 - features we wanted to add to it then we
03:05 - didn't get end up getting with our first
03:08 - initial concept was we wanted to use ml
03:10 - to detect your face and figure out what
03:12 - emotion you were and then based on that
03:14 - emotion so I guess mood vibe whatever
03:16 - you want to call it we would serve
03:17 - different music to you this didn't end
03:20 - up working I'll talk about that later
03:21 - but now I'm just gonna be looking at
03:23 - this itinerary and just kind of walking
03:24 - you through the hours of the hackathon
03:25 - and what happened so our bus left at
03:27 - 3:30 4:00 in the morning we got to
03:29 - Montreal around 6:00 there was breakfast
03:31 - at 7:00 a.m. in between 6:30 and 7:00
03:34 - was where we got to find our workspace
03:35 - now this was like vitally important
03:37 - which we didn't really realize was
03:39 - finding a good workspace so there's a
03:41 - massive building is about 12 stories
03:43 - tall that just had a ton of rooms in it
03:45 - there were kind of like boardroom study
03:46 - room kind of things so we had to find
03:48 - one of those literally every room was
03:50 - taken when we got there we got lucky and
03:52 - we actually had the security guard open
03:54 - up a different room on one of the higher
03:55 - floors for us so I'll show you a photo
03:57 - we ended up getting a decent room and
03:59 - then between that time and 9:30 a.m. was
04:02 - kind of a time to continue planning and
04:04 - think about what idea we wanted now 9:30
04:06 - a.m. was the opening ceremonies I'll
04:08 - show some clips of it here and they're
04:09 - essentially all the sponsors came out
04:11 - they announced you know what their
04:12 - challenges were and why they were you
04:14 - know sponsoring the events and that was
04:15 - pretty cool I got to hear about a lot of
04:17 - the cool stuff that some Canadian
04:18 - companies were doing to lift some
04:20 - sponsors I'm just gonna go to the back
04:21 - of the book here because I can't
04:22 - remember some of them there was a
04:25 - P unity tell us sap Zendesk sonlife
04:29 - octave group Shutterstock CGI and you
04:32 - know there's a ton more as like lenôtre
04:35 - Ubisoft matte rocks there I think there
04:38 - was like 30 sponsors or something for
04:40 - this event so after 9:30 at 10:45 the
04:44 - hacking period started now this is 24
04:46 - hour hacking so literally between that
04:48 - time and 10:45 a.m. the next day is when
04:51 - you had time to build your projects we
04:52 - got started right away and you know
04:54 - built a ton of different stuff now in
04:57 - between there I believe there was lunch
04:58 - at 12:00
04:59 - there was a career fair they had that I
05:01 - didn't end up going to that was in the
05:02 - main kind of Lobby where they had all
05:04 - the sponsored booth it's and you had an
05:06 - opportunity to go talk to the sponsors
05:07 - network you give your resumes if you
05:09 - wanted to and they actually gave us
05:11 - these badges which I'm holding right
05:12 - here that have a QR code on them that
05:14 - represent like this QR code is pretty
05:17 - much everything about you so when you
05:18 - applied to the event you gave in your
05:20 - resume and all this information so any
05:21 - of the sponsors if they wanted your info
05:23 - they could just scan this QR and I'm
05:25 - just wearing it so you guys so I
05:26 - remembered to talk about it and they'd
05:28 - get all that info which was pretty cool
05:29 - this was also how we got lunch we just
05:31 - scanned that and all the meals that they
05:33 - provided for free at the event so lunch
05:35 - was at 12:00
05:36 - there was a midnight snack at 6:45 or
05:39 - not midnight sack sorry supper at 6:45
05:41 - and then midnight snack obviously at
05:43 - midnight and then hacking ended 10:45
05:45 - a.m. the next day
05:46 - so I'll kind of walk you through our
05:47 - sequence of events while hacking
05:49 - so once hacking started when you got a
05:51 - really good start for the first like two
05:53 - three hours everyone was just kind of
05:55 - learning all the modules we knew exactly
05:56 - what we were gonna do and then at kind
05:59 - of the three hour mark I had been trying
06:00 - to train this ml model to do your motion
06:02 - recognition it was like kind of working
06:04 - but it just was a huge headache and it
06:06 - was gonna take way longer and I knew I
06:08 - wouldn't have enough time to implement
06:09 - it so we scrapped that and then I
06:10 - started working on the music API now the
06:13 - guys the other guys on our team were
06:14 - just like learning front-end development
06:16 - and learning all the stuff they needed
06:17 - to do to make the website which I'm
06:19 - gonna show you guys later so the
06:21 - company's API that we use was called
06:23 - octave group and they do like all kinds
06:25 - of music delivery systems and stuff for
06:27 - companies and they have like apple music
06:29 - for business they're like partners with
06:31 - that so they had this API that they
06:33 - wrote custom for this event
06:34 - unfortunately this was the worst API
06:37 - I've ever worked with and it result
06:38 - to me taking about seven hours to
06:40 - actually get it fully functioning and
06:41 - part of those seven hours was me going
06:43 - down to the sponsored booth and sitting
06:45 - beside the guy who wrote the API who was
06:47 - actually there and I was texting with
06:48 - him on this little chat app like for
06:50 - like three hours before that so I went
06:52 - down sat with him we debug this API and
06:55 - eventually after like two hours of doing
06:57 - that we got it working while I was
06:59 - sitting down here I'll say about five or
07:00 - six groups actually came up and had the
07:02 - same issue was as us so anyways that was
07:04 - fun so after that we got the music part
07:06 - working we're already kind of behind cuz
07:08 - I figured I would have done that quicker
07:10 - and then I just started working on more
07:11 - back and more back and more back-end and
07:13 - you know I can't really walk you guys
07:15 - through everything that was happening
07:16 - but essentially I'll say that once we
07:17 - got to the 12 hour mark of hacking all
07:19 - of us had been up for at least I want to
07:21 - say 30 hours so we were pretty exhausted
07:25 - and it was starting to get a lot
07:26 - sloppier when it came to coding like at
07:28 - the beginning everything was beautiful I
07:30 - get commits we're wonderful and then you
07:32 - know all you guys can see the repository
07:34 - I'll put in the description things just
07:35 - kind of went to crap um and yeah so I
07:38 - was interesting so names we stopped
07:39 - hacking at 10:45 a.m. we had a
07:41 - functioning application with a few
07:42 - things kind of broken but as we expected
07:44 - and then it was time for project demos
07:46 - so project demos are essentially you
07:48 - bring all your stuff downstairs you set
07:50 - up your laptop and you just demo what
07:51 - you made now this was really cool cuz I
07:53 - got to see what everyone else was
07:54 - working on and I will say there was some
07:56 - groups that made some mind-boggling just
07:58 - amazing things some ones off the top of
08:00 - my head were like a sign language
08:01 - detector these guys made an augmented
08:04 - reality like clash of clans kind of like
08:06 - game there was one for like parking
08:09 - assistance there was just all these
08:11 - different apps I'm not gonna run you
08:12 - guys through all of them but really cool
08:14 - to see what people were able to come up
08:15 - with and some of these things looking at
08:17 - them like could have been full-on
08:18 - businesses what they made in 24 hours
08:21 - which makes me question if they really
08:22 - did it at during the hackathon if they
08:24 - did it beforehand but regardless and
08:26 - really cool so after that we had the
08:29 - closing ceremony so that demo was
08:31 - actually also known as the judging
08:32 - period where judges would go around and
08:34 - rank your kind of stuff and look at it
08:36 - unfortunately during the closing
08:37 - ceremonies we didn't win any awards
08:39 - that's just because as you guys will see
08:40 - when I demo the project it wasn't very
08:42 - fine-tuned the initial idea and concepts
08:44 - were there but a lot of things we wanted
08:46 - to add we couldn't execute on and you
08:48 - know looking back all of us probably
08:49 - would have changed our approach to what
08:50 - we decided to me
08:51 - if we were really going for awards but
08:53 - it was a great learning experience had a
08:55 - great time and at the end of the day I
08:57 - mean you know as much as some of the
08:58 - prizes were pretty meaningful that's not
09:00 - why we went to we went to have a good
09:01 - time create an app and that's exactly
09:03 - what we did so during the closing
09:05 - ceremonies they announced you know the
09:06 - winners that's where people got to got
09:08 - to go up and present what they maiden
09:10 - get the prizes from the sponsors then
09:12 - after that we took our bus back from
09:14 - Montreal back home and that was the
09:16 - event so that was kind of the story of
09:18 - my hackathon event really great time and
09:20 - again I would recommend to any of you if
09:22 - you'd like to go to those you don't do
09:24 - it just go even if you don't have a team
09:26 - go solo there was a ton of people that
09:27 - went solo there's actually someone who
09:29 - won I think like fifth place in the
09:31 - entire event of like 700 people alone
09:34 - which was really impressive and it was
09:35 - good for her so anyways that was my
09:37 - story now I'm gonna get into a demo and
09:38 - show you guys exactly what we built all
09:41 - right so I'm on my computer here and I'm
09:42 - gonna be showing you guys the website
09:44 - that we actually built now unfortunately
09:46 - there's quite a few errors with this
09:47 - website now because our API token that
09:49 - was used to access the API for the music
09:52 - was actually invalidated today so that
09:54 - means a lot of the kind of online and
09:56 - cooler features of this website don't
09:58 - work anymore so I've had to modify it to
10:00 - work offline but I still will be able to
10:02 - show you most of the functionality so
10:04 - this is our website it is called vibe
10:06 - now you can see this is running
10:08 - localhost right we haven't deployed this
10:10 - this is meant to run localhost it's not
10:11 - meant to run on an actual proper you
10:13 - know web server and this is run using
10:15 - flask now I'm just gonna show you guys
10:17 - some of the features of the website and
10:18 - I'll talk about the more technical
10:20 - details so obviously on the sidebar here
10:22 - you can choose your vibe so happy sad
10:24 - energetic or calm and that was kind of
10:25 - the selling point of our website was
10:27 - just really simple really easy we don't
10:29 - want all these custom features just
10:31 - simplistic you pick a vibe and it shows
10:33 - you some songs that are in that fight
10:35 - now I've manually added these songs to
10:37 - this playlist but the idea is you can
10:39 - search for songs at the top here
10:41 - this isn't currently working as I'll
10:43 - show you because we don't have access to
10:44 - the API anymore and then you can decide
10:46 - to add those songs to whatever playlist
10:48 - you want and you can kind of organize
10:50 - your songs into four different vibes so
10:53 - what we have here is you know the
10:55 - duration the artist and the song and if
10:57 - we want to go ahead and play some music
10:58 - we can press play now the idea here
11:01 - again would be that you would cue songs
11:03 - and then you know you
11:05 - view your cue and play the songs again I
11:07 - can't do that for you guys because the
11:09 - API is not working so we can't actually
11:10 - do that now I'll show you a little bit
11:13 - about how this communication actually
11:15 - happens from the websites so the API
11:17 - we're using actually runs on your
11:20 - computer it runs a music server locally
11:22 - so the way that you need to play music
11:25 - is by sending specific commands to this
11:27 - music server in the form of you know get
11:29 - requests work post request so in this
11:31 - case you can see all the different
11:32 - commands running on my web server which
11:34 - is on the right side here which runs the
11:36 - website and then you can see some
11:38 - commands on the left side which runs the
11:39 - music server so what we did was we had
11:41 - this website here send commands to the
11:45 - music server to play the sound so this
11:47 - is really just an interface for the
11:48 - music playing in the background of your
11:50 - computer and that's why again we can't
11:52 - make this work you know over the web on
11:53 - HTTP because that wouldn't work you need
11:56 - to have the music server running on your
11:58 - computer as well so I mean I'll just
12:00 - play a few songs for you guys to prove
12:02 - that this is indeed working so I'm just
12:03 - gonna fast forward and we see we'll play
12:05 - the next song in our playlist last
12:08 - fast-forward again and we get another
12:10 - song now unfortunately I can't play too
12:13 - much of the song otherwise YouTube is
12:15 - probably gonna take down this video for
12:17 - copyright but you get the point right so
12:19 - this is the web server here we can
12:20 - decide which songs to play and yeah
12:23 - that's pretty much what we were able to
12:24 - accomplish on this website so I'll walk
12:26 - you a little bit through the code here
12:28 - and just give you an idea of how much
12:29 - actually went into the site and why you
12:31 - know maybe it's not as amazing as you
12:33 - guys would have pictured in 24 hours
12:35 - keep in mind that this was created with
12:37 - pretty well absolutely no breaks so at
12:39 - the beginning the code was all nice and
12:41 - beautiful and then by the time we got to
12:43 - you know probably 12 hours
12:44 - we stopped really caring and just coded
12:46 - and tried to get it done as fast as
12:47 - possible so you'll notice that the
12:49 - entire front and I'm kind of looking at
12:50 - it right here with index is built with
12:52 - pretty well all custom HTML and CSS so
12:55 - almost everything we did here was custom
12:57 - we used a little bit of bootstrap but
12:59 - really only for those tables that you
13:01 - saw in the main page bootstrap was not a
13:04 - main part of this website and then we
13:06 - wrote all custom jQuery and JavaScript
13:08 - to handle some of the things like
13:10 - changing the vibe in the gradient based
13:12 - on the one that you could choose so
13:14 - notice this is the gradient for
13:15 - energetic if we go to happy we get a
13:17 - different gradient that gives us some
13:18 - different
13:18 - colors so that was kind of a cool
13:20 - feature of our website as well one of
13:21 - our other teammates managed to get those
13:23 - gradients working which was awesome and
13:24 - now I'm in kind of the main back end
13:26 - which is what I was responsible for for
13:29 - most of the event so I handled kind of
13:31 - setting up most of this flask backend
13:33 - although those guys did do some of it as
13:35 - well the other teammates and then I
13:37 - pretty much wrote everything in this
13:38 - models folder here which handles all the
13:41 - connection to the website are certain as
13:44 - the website to the music server that I
13:45 - showed you guys are running so we have a
13:46 - database we actually store all of the
13:48 - songs that people select and add to
13:51 - their playlist in a MySQL database
13:52 - that's local on the computer then we had
13:55 - this player module and you can see kind
13:57 - of some of the things that I was sending
13:58 - here so all of my different
14:00 - authorization you know you guys can copy
14:01 - this token if you want it's not working
14:03 - anymore
14:03 - we have playlist which just handles you
14:05 - know playlist object song pretty basic
14:07 - and then song library which actually
14:09 - searches through all the songs from the
14:11 - API but again this isn't working because
14:13 - we don't have access then we had a few
14:15 - other things we had to do so we had a
14:17 - setup script just to remove some old
14:19 - songs and to update the playlist
14:20 - manually so that this would work locally
14:22 - and then a start music and start website
14:24 - just as some shortcuts to actually get
14:26 - the music server and website running so
14:28 - that was pretty much what we did at the
14:30 - hackathon in 24 hours the people that we
14:32 - showed this to were pretty impressed
14:33 - just because they did understand how
14:35 - difficult it actually was to work with
14:37 - that API so I'm happy with it it was a
14:39 - cool event and definitely a great
14:41 - learning experience especially when it
14:42 - comes to front-end development as I had

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back now some of you might have noticed that wasn't super active the past couple of days on YouTube and that's because there was actually attending a hackathon now what I'm going to be doing in this video is discussing what I built at the hackathon why it was such an awesome event and kind of walking you guys through the story of how we ended up getting to where we went now if you haven't heard of a hackathon I'm gonna briefly introduce you to what kind of the concept an idea is but I would definitely highly recommend that any of you if you have the opportunity to go do attend one as it is a really cool experience so the hackathon that I went to is actually in Montreal at Concordia University now this was a really awesome event it was massive there was about 700 or 800 people actually there which broke down into about close to 150 teams of four people now essentially what hackathon is is a 24 hour or 36 or some duration long event where you just build a hack now a hack could be something Hardware related it could be something software related but they all follow a kind of theme now after this event I believe there was something around 25 different sponsors and there was about 12 different sponsored challenges now what these challenges are are large sponsors like we had sponsors like TD and Sun Life and a bunch of other massive tech companies like CGI and I'll name a few other ones later it will pick some something that they want you to build so let's say hey use our TD insurance API and build an app that you know does this with it or does that with it so you can decide to compete in these different challenges and then if you win you'll get different prizes so I think one of the better prizes I noticed was an oculus rift and that was given to every single person of the winning team and I believe that was from I don't actually know the company that sponsored it but it was like an augmented reality challenge where you had to build some AR game or some augmented reality application so there's a lot of cool stuff there I know what RS they had like a Unity game development one which is really interesting in the project we actually decided to build with something to do with called the octave music API now you probably haven't heard of this company as I haven't but their challenge was build something with our music API so that's what we decided to do so anyways that's enough about what hackathon is and kind of how they work now let's talk about my adventure to and from this hackathon and how we built the application that we did right so I'm just gonna kind of walk you guys through the itinerary for this hackathon what happened through it a little bit of story of how we built our application so I'm gonna start from actually midnight the day before the hackathon so this would have been I guess Friday night so since our bus actually left to go to Montreal at 330 in the morning we kind of decided that we weren't gonna go to bed the night before we're gonna sleep the entire day and then we were gonna stay up until the bus so maybe from like 9 p.m. until when the bus arrived and that would be fine so that's what we decided to do maybe a bit of a mistake but anyways we went to one of our other guys on the teams house and we stayed there and just kind of got to know each other a bit better because some of us hadn't worked together before like I didn't know to the teammates that were on our team and we looked at all of the sponsored prizes and all the different companies that were gonna be there so this is where we actually decided our idea which was gonna be to build this music player we had a whole bunch of features we wanted to add to it then we didn't get end up getting with our first initial concept was we wanted to use ml to detect your face and figure out what emotion you were and then based on that emotion so I guess mood vibe whatever you want to call it we would serve different music to you this didn't end up working I'll talk about that later but now I'm just gonna be looking at this itinerary and just kind of walking you through the hours of the hackathon and what happened so our bus left at 330 400 in the morning we got to Montreal around 600 there was breakfast at 700 a.m. in between 630 and 700 was where we got to find our workspace now this was like vitally important which we didn't really realize was finding a good workspace so there's a massive building is about 12 stories tall that just had a ton of rooms in it there were kind of like boardroom study room kind of things so we had to find one of those literally every room was taken when we got there we got lucky and we actually had the security guard open up a different room on one of the higher floors for us so I'll show you a photo we ended up getting a decent room and then between that time and 930 a.m. was kind of a time to continue planning and think about what idea we wanted now 930 a.m. was the opening ceremonies I'll show some clips of it here and they're essentially all the sponsors came out they announced you know what their challenges were and why they were you know sponsoring the events and that was pretty cool I got to hear about a lot of the cool stuff that some Canadian companies were doing to lift some sponsors I'm just gonna go to the back of the book here because I can't remember some of them there was a P unity tell us sap Zendesk sonlife octave group Shutterstock CGI and you know there's a ton more as like lenôtre Ubisoft matte rocks there I think there was like 30 sponsors or something for this event so after 930 at 1045 the hacking period started now this is 24 hour hacking so literally between that time and 1045 a.m. the next day is when you had time to build your projects we got started right away and you know built a ton of different stuff now in between there I believe there was lunch at 1200 there was a career fair they had that I didn't end up going to that was in the main kind of Lobby where they had all the sponsored booth it's and you had an opportunity to go talk to the sponsors network you give your resumes if you wanted to and they actually gave us these badges which I'm holding right here that have a QR code on them that represent like this QR code is pretty much everything about you so when you applied to the event you gave in your resume and all this information so any of the sponsors if they wanted your info they could just scan this QR and I'm just wearing it so you guys so I remembered to talk about it and they'd get all that info which was pretty cool this was also how we got lunch we just scanned that and all the meals that they provided for free at the event so lunch was at 1200 there was a midnight snack at 645 or not midnight sack sorry supper at 645 and then midnight snack obviously at midnight and then hacking ended 1045 a.m. the next day so I'll kind of walk you through our sequence of events while hacking so once hacking started when you got a really good start for the first like two three hours everyone was just kind of learning all the modules we knew exactly what we were gonna do and then at kind of the three hour mark I had been trying to train this ml model to do your motion recognition it was like kind of working but it just was a huge headache and it was gonna take way longer and I knew I wouldn't have enough time to implement it so we scrapped that and then I started working on the music API now the guys the other guys on our team were just like learning frontend development and learning all the stuff they needed to do to make the website which I'm gonna show you guys later so the company's API that we use was called octave group and they do like all kinds of music delivery systems and stuff for companies and they have like apple music for business they're like partners with that so they had this API that they wrote custom for this event unfortunately this was the worst API I've ever worked with and it result to me taking about seven hours to actually get it fully functioning and part of those seven hours was me going down to the sponsored booth and sitting beside the guy who wrote the API who was actually there and I was texting with him on this little chat app like for like three hours before that so I went down sat with him we debug this API and eventually after like two hours of doing that we got it working while I was sitting down here I'll say about five or six groups actually came up and had the same issue was as us so anyways that was fun so after that we got the music part working we're already kind of behind cuz I figured I would have done that quicker and then I just started working on more back and more back and more backend and you know I can't really walk you guys through everything that was happening but essentially I'll say that once we got to the 12 hour mark of hacking all of us had been up for at least I want to say 30 hours so we were pretty exhausted and it was starting to get a lot sloppier when it came to coding like at the beginning everything was beautiful I get commits we're wonderful and then you know all you guys can see the repository I'll put in the description things just kind of went to crap um and yeah so I was interesting so names we stopped hacking at 1045 a.m. we had a functioning application with a few things kind of broken but as we expected and then it was time for project demos so project demos are essentially you bring all your stuff downstairs you set up your laptop and you just demo what you made now this was really cool cuz I got to see what everyone else was working on and I will say there was some groups that made some mindboggling just amazing things some ones off the top of my head were like a sign language detector these guys made an augmented reality like clash of clans kind of like game there was one for like parking assistance there was just all these different apps I'm not gonna run you guys through all of them but really cool to see what people were able to come up with and some of these things looking at them like could have been fullon businesses what they made in 24 hours which makes me question if they really did it at during the hackathon if they did it beforehand but regardless and really cool so after that we had the closing ceremony so that demo was actually also known as the judging period where judges would go around and rank your kind of stuff and look at it unfortunately during the closing ceremonies we didn't win any awards that's just because as you guys will see when I demo the project it wasn't very finetuned the initial idea and concepts were there but a lot of things we wanted to add we couldn't execute on and you know looking back all of us probably would have changed our approach to what we decided to me if we were really going for awards but it was a great learning experience had a great time and at the end of the day I mean you know as much as some of the prizes were pretty meaningful that's not why we went to we went to have a good time create an app and that's exactly what we did so during the closing ceremonies they announced you know the winners that's where people got to got to go up and present what they maiden get the prizes from the sponsors then after that we took our bus back from Montreal back home and that was the event so that was kind of the story of my hackathon event really great time and again I would recommend to any of you if you'd like to go to those you don't do it just go even if you don't have a team go solo there was a ton of people that went solo there's actually someone who won I think like fifth place in the entire event of like 700 people alone which was really impressive and it was good for her so anyways that was my story now I'm gonna get into a demo and show you guys exactly what we built all right so I'm on my computer here and I'm gonna be showing you guys the website that we actually built now unfortunately there's quite a few errors with this website now because our API token that was used to access the API for the music was actually invalidated today so that means a lot of the kind of online and cooler features of this website don't work anymore so I've had to modify it to work offline but I still will be able to show you most of the functionality so this is our website it is called vibe now you can see this is running localhost right we haven't deployed this this is meant to run localhost it's not meant to run on an actual proper you know web server and this is run using flask now I'm just gonna show you guys some of the features of the website and I'll talk about the more technical details so obviously on the sidebar here you can choose your vibe so happy sad energetic or calm and that was kind of the selling point of our website was just really simple really easy we don't want all these custom features just simplistic you pick a vibe and it shows you some songs that are in that fight now I've manually added these songs to this playlist but the idea is you can search for songs at the top here this isn't currently working as I'll show you because we don't have access to the API anymore and then you can decide to add those songs to whatever playlist you want and you can kind of organize your songs into four different vibes so what we have here is you know the duration the artist and the song and if we want to go ahead and play some music we can press play now the idea here again would be that you would cue songs and then you know you view your cue and play the songs again I can't do that for you guys because the API is not working so we can't actually do that now I'll show you a little bit about how this communication actually happens from the websites so the API we're using actually runs on your computer it runs a music server locally so the way that you need to play music is by sending specific commands to this music server in the form of you know get requests work post request so in this case you can see all the different commands running on my web server which is on the right side here which runs the website and then you can see some commands on the left side which runs the music server so what we did was we had this website here send commands to the music server to play the sound so this is really just an interface for the music playing in the background of your computer and that's why again we can't make this work you know over the web on HTTP because that wouldn't work you need to have the music server running on your computer as well so I mean I'll just play a few songs for you guys to prove that this is indeed working so I'm just gonna fast forward and we see we'll play the next song in our playlist last fastforward again and we get another song now unfortunately I can't play too much of the song otherwise YouTube is probably gonna take down this video for copyright but you get the point right so this is the web server here we can decide which songs to play and yeah that's pretty much what we were able to accomplish on this website so I'll walk you a little bit through the code here and just give you an idea of how much actually went into the site and why you know maybe it's not as amazing as you guys would have pictured in 24 hours keep in mind that this was created with pretty well absolutely no breaks so at the beginning the code was all nice and beautiful and then by the time we got to you know probably 12 hours we stopped really caring and just coded and tried to get it done as fast as possible so you'll notice that the entire front and I'm kind of looking at it right here with index is built with pretty well all custom HTML and CSS so almost everything we did here was custom we used a little bit of bootstrap but really only for those tables that you saw in the main page bootstrap was not a main part of this website and then we wrote all custom jQuery and JavaScript to handle some of the things like changing the vibe in the gradient based on the one that you could choose so notice this is the gradient for energetic if we go to happy we get a different gradient that gives us some different colors so that was kind of a cool feature of our website as well one of our other teammates managed to get those gradients working which was awesome and now I'm in kind of the main back end which is what I was responsible for for most of the event so I handled kind of setting up most of this flask backend although those guys did do some of it as well the other teammates and then I pretty much wrote everything in this models folder here which handles all the connection to the website are certain as the website to the music server that I showed you guys are running so we have a database we actually store all of the songs that people select and add to their playlist in a MySQL database that's local on the computer then we had this player module and you can see kind of some of the things that I was sending here so all of my different authorization you know you guys can copy this token if you want it's not working anymore we have playlist which just handles you know playlist object song pretty basic and then song library which actually searches through all the songs from the API but again this isn't working because we don't have access then we had a few other things we had to do so we had a setup script just to remove some old songs and to update the playlist manually so that this would work locally and then a start music and start website just as some shortcuts to actually get the music server and website running so that was pretty much what we did at the hackathon in 24 hours the people that we showed this to were pretty impressed just because they did understand how difficult it actually was to work with that API so I'm happy with it it was a cool event and definitely a great learning experience especially when it comes to frontend development as I had not very much experience with that before the event so no reason that has been it for this video if you guys enjoyed make sure you
