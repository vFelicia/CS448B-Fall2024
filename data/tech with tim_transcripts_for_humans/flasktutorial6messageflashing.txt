00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this last tutorial what we're gonna be
00:03 - doing is talking about message flashing
00:05 - now essentially message flashing is
00:07 - showing some kind of information from a
00:09 - previous page on the next page when
00:10 - something happens on the GUI so for
00:12 - example say I login it redirects me to
00:15 - another page and then maybe on the top
00:16 - of that page it says logged in
00:17 - successfully or if I log out maybe I'm
00:20 - gonna get redirected to another page but
00:22 - I want to show on that other page that I
00:24 - logged out successfully so I'll flash a
00:26 - message in a certain part of that page
00:28 - so that the user has some idea what they
00:31 - actually did so it's to give them a
00:32 - little bit more interaction with the
00:33 - page some feedback for things that they
00:35 - do so they have an idea what's going on
00:37 - and that rather than having to change
00:39 - the whole page entirely or passing
00:40 - through some other variables to show on
00:42 - the screen you can just flash a message
00:44 - and it makes it really easy to do this
00:46 - in flask so to actually flash a message
00:48 - all you need to do is to import flash
00:50 - and then you can use this function to
00:53 - display or kind of like post the
00:55 - messages that are to be flashed and then
00:56 - from the different pages we can decide
00:58 - where we want to flash those and we'll
01:00 - do that in a second so a basic example
01:02 - of when you might want to flash a
01:03 - message in our kind of script here and
01:05 - this is where we left off in the last
01:07 - tutorial is when we log out because what
01:09 - happens when we log out is we go to this
01:11 - page but then it pops our session and
01:13 - redirects us back to the login page so
01:15 - on the login page we probably want to
01:17 - show logged out successful so that they
01:19 - know there wasn't an error and they
01:21 - didn't you know they're not still logged
01:22 - in they know that they logged out so to
01:24 - do this I'm gonna say flash and then
01:26 - here I'll just put the message that I
01:27 - want to show which is you have been
01:30 - logged out like that and then the next
01:34 - actual parameter for this is the
01:36 - category now this is optional but I'm
01:38 - just gonna put info as the category as
01:40 - that's one of the built-in one so I
01:42 - believe that warning info and air and
01:43 - that's just if you want to show some
01:45 - icons and stuff beside it you could use
01:47 - the category to do that so that is
01:50 - pretty much it for flashing a message
01:52 - now we actually need to display the
01:54 - message from our different pages so what
01:56 - I'm gonna do is go to the login page and
01:58 - inside my block content I'm gonna write
02:00 - a few kind of templated code here to
02:03 - display all of the flashed messages that
02:05 - come up so to do this I'm going to say
02:08 - with oops if I could spell with
02:10 - correctly messages equals gets punished
02:13 - or flashed hundred square messages makes
02:17 - you add the brackets and then I will end
02:19 - my with so do % % and wit then what I'm
02:23 - gonna do is an if statement inside of
02:25 - here this if statement will just check
02:26 - if we actually have any messages to
02:28 - display so if messages like that we will
02:33 - end the if statement and then if we do
02:34 - have any messages to display we will
02:36 - loop through them and actually display
02:38 - them so now what I'm gonna do is go
02:41 - percent percent for in this case MSG in
02:46 - messages making sure we're spelling
02:48 - everything correctly then we'll end the
02:51 - for loop and then what I can do is
02:52 - display all these messages so to do that
02:55 - we'll just add a piece AG we'll put two
02:57 - of these curly braces will put MSG and
02:59 - then we'll end the P tag now I kind of
03:01 - zip through this cuz we've seen this
03:02 - before but essentially the width is just
03:04 - another Python syntax you can use in
03:06 - here we're gonna say messages equals
03:08 - whatever these get flashed messages are
03:10 - check if there's any to display if there
03:12 - is we'll loop through them we'll display
03:13 - them and that will be it now notice that
03:15 - we can actually have more than one flash
03:17 - message which means if we go between a
03:18 - few different pages maybe we'll show two
03:20 - or three flash messages on a specific
03:22 - page so I'm gonna leave that like this
03:24 - for now and we'll do a quick test and
03:26 - then we'll talk about some issues with
03:27 - what we have right now and adding some
03:29 - different flashes and some different
03:30 - ways of handling it so I'm gonna run
03:32 - this script so python tutorial 6.2 pi
03:35 - open this up in my browser you can see i
03:38 - had it running before so let's refresh
03:39 - that i'm on the home page i've also
03:41 - modified this navbar so that i have log
03:44 - in and log out as direct links here
03:46 - pretty basic you guys could probably
03:47 - figure out how to do that so i'll go to
03:49 - login will go like you know hello submit
03:52 - there we go around the user page now if
03:54 - we go to slash log out you can see that
03:57 - we get the message you have been logged
03:59 - out and it still shows our name now
04:01 - notice though if I go to like let's say
04:03 - the slash and then I go to slash logout
04:06 - again it says you have been logged out
04:08 - once more now maybe we only want to show
04:11 - that you have been logged out if you
04:12 - actually were logged in so in that case
04:14 - what we could do is we could check if we
04:17 - have a user in the session and only if
04:18 - we do then we will say you've been
04:20 - locked out so we could say
04:22 - we'll actually just copy this so if user
04:26 - in session user equals session user and
04:29 - then maybe we actually display like
04:30 - whatever their name is that they've been
04:32 - logged out so in this case we can say
04:34 - flash you have been logged out comma and
04:37 - then maybe we'll put their name so in
04:39 - this case I'll actually just use an F
04:40 - string like that and put user so now
04:45 - this way we actually display their name
04:46 - and tell them they've been logged out
04:48 - but only if we actually had a user in
04:50 - the session ok so that is pretty much it
04:53 - for that so now I'm going to show you
04:54 - how we can flash a few different
04:55 - messages I also want to change the page
04:57 - for this because we're gonna be using
04:58 - something different so let's start by
05:00 - actually creating a new HTML file which
05:02 - we'll use to render the user page
05:04 - because right now we just have these h1
05:06 - tags and I'd like to make something that
05:08 - looks a little bit nicer so I'm gonna
05:09 - say user dot HTML new file we will
05:12 - simply extend that base template so
05:15 - extends in quotes face dot HTML and then
05:20 - we can add our blocks
05:21 - so we'll say block in this case title I
05:25 - don't really know what to call this one
05:27 - so I'll just call it oops what am I
05:30 - doing here
05:30 - and block we'll just call it like user
05:33 - because why not and then we'll add the
05:35 - blocks for content we'll set up our
05:37 - message flashing and we'll be good to go
05:39 - so block content and then and block I'm
05:44 - actually gonna make it so it displace
05:46 - like hello like welcome user whatever it
05:48 - is so to do that I'll just add a P tag
05:50 - and I'll just say welcome comma and then
05:55 - we'll just pass in actually like a user
05:58 - so we'll say user like that and then we
06:00 - can display that message flashing which
06:01 - all I'm gonna do to do that is copy this
06:03 - from the login page and put that at the
06:05 - top of the user page like that so now I
06:08 - think I missed one of the things from
06:10 - here I did I missed this with so let's
06:12 - grab that put that back in here top that
06:16 - in and now we'll display the message
06:17 - flashing and then this so now what we
06:19 - need to do is simply render this from
06:21 - our other page here so what I'm gonna do
06:22 - is go back to where we have user rather
06:24 - than just rendering the user's name will
06:26 - actually render the template so we'll
06:28 - say render template believe I've called
06:30 - this users HTML and then we'll pass user
06:34 - equal
06:35 - user like that and that should display
06:37 - it for us now let's see where else we
06:39 - might want to flash a few more messages
06:41 - before we end here so let's grab a flash
06:43 - here actually I don't need to copy the
06:45 - I'll just type it out so for example
06:46 - when they login we probably want to tell
06:49 - them that they logged in so to do that
06:50 - we can flash a message in here so we'll
06:53 - say flash and then login successful like
06:59 - that so we'll flash that one there we'll
07:01 - also flash that one hmm you know what
07:05 - what what I'm gonna do here is what this
07:07 - is doing right is saying if you go to
07:09 - the login page but you're already logged
07:10 - in it just brings you to the user page
07:14 - it just redirects you there
07:16 - so what I'll do is say if they go to the
07:18 - login page and they get redirected
07:19 - already logged in so that way when they
07:22 - go back to the user page they know that
07:24 - no nothing went wrong they actually just
07:26 - are already logged in so that's why they
07:27 - got redirected there okay so I think
07:30 - that is pretty much good for now when I
07:32 - go to this user page I'm actually gonna
07:34 - flash a message - that says you are not
07:36 - logged in because that means that if
07:40 - they try to go to the user page and
07:41 - they're not logged in they shouldn't be
07:42 - able to see anything so we'll redirect
07:44 - them back to the login page so anyways
07:46 - this might not be perfect but this will
07:48 - do for now so let's test it out and see
07:49 - if I made any errors which I likely did
07:51 - so let's go back to the home page so
07:55 - I'll just go home like that you have
07:58 - been logged out okay I think that was
07:59 - just the last message to show so let's
08:01 - go to slash login there we go let's
08:05 - login as Tim submit long and successful
08:08 - welcome Tim okay looks like that's
08:09 - working right now let's go back to the
08:11 - home page no messages to display
08:13 - let's go login already logged in welcome
08:16 - Tim and then last we will check out
08:18 - logout and when we did that he didn't
08:21 - flash the message back on this page let
08:23 - me check if this is actually correct
08:26 - here what I'm gonna do is just honestly
08:28 - rather than checking this session here
08:30 - let's just always flash that you've been
08:32 - logged out because regardless of what
08:33 - they do they probably should be told
08:35 - that they were logged out so let's just
08:37 - do this now again login you know H
08:41 - submit oh what's going on here let's see
08:44 - here okay successful login now if we go
08:47 - to back to slash law
08:49 - you've been logged out function user at
08:51 - blah blah okay that's interesting why
08:53 - that showed that um user Oh oops
08:57 - this is displaying a function I need to
08:58 - get rid of f string my apologies guys
09:00 - okay but that is essentially how we
09:02 - flash the messages don't worry about
09:04 - that last error just because I was
09:05 - passing the user function so displayed
09:08 - this weird string of text but that is
09:10 - message flashing so with that if you
09:12 - guys enjoyed the video make sure you
09:13 - leave a like and subscribe in the next
09:16 - video I think we're gonna get into some
09:17 - database stuff and start getting a bit
09:18 - more complicated and talk about how to
09:20 - set up an actual scalable web server so
09:22 - anyways that has been it and I will see
09:23 - you guys in the next flasks tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this last tutorial what we're gonna be doing is talking about message flashing now essentially message flashing is showing some kind of information from a previous page on the next page when something happens on the GUI so for example say I login it redirects me to another page and then maybe on the top of that page it says logged in successfully or if
