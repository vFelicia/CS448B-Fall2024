00:01 - you actually get good this video is
00:03 - going to give you a detailed guide on
00:05 - exactly what you need to focus on to
00:07 - improve your programming skills quickly
00:09 - now the first thing you'll want to focus
00:11 - on is really mastering the syntax of a
00:13 - language what I'm really referring to
00:15 - here is getting really comfortable with
00:17 - the way in which you write code in a
00:18 - language so you don't need to constantly
00:20 - look up some of the more basic features
00:22 - once you get that down you're going to
00:24 - want to develop a bit of pattern
00:25 - recognition which means you've seen a
00:27 - lot of basic problems and you
00:28 - immediately know the way in which you
00:30 - should go about solving them after that
00:32 - you really want to focus on
00:33 - understanding the various tools you have
00:35 - available to you to solve different
00:37 - problems what you're really focusing on
00:38 - is being able to take a more abstract
00:40 - concept something that's theoretical and
00:42 - then bring that into a project what you
00:44 - really need to get good at next is just
00:46 - figuring things out getting really good
00:48 - at problem solving and building the
00:49 - confidence to know that no matter what
00:51 - problem you're presented with you can
00:53 - solve it it just a matter of how and how
00:55 - long it's going to take you
