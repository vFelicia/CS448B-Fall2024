00:00 - hey guys and welcome back from the kV
00:02 - tutorial so in today's video we're gonna
00:04 - be going through how to change screens
00:06 - so essentially having multiple windows
00:08 - and then doing some kind of transition
00:10 - between them based on like an event
00:12 - occurs so the exact example that I'm
00:14 - gonna be using is we're gonna have a
00:15 - login form and if you type in the
00:17 - password correctly it'll move you to the
00:19 - next page
00:20 - if not then obviously it won't move you
00:22 - there so this is actually quite a few
00:23 - steps so make sure you guys follow along
00:25 - closely and as always all the code will
00:27 - be up on tech with Tim net ok so what
00:29 - we're actually gonna start by doing is
00:31 - something different that we haven't done
00:33 - yet so notice that I change the name of
00:35 - my main app I've just deleted
00:37 - essentially everything there's nothing
00:38 - in my KB file to my main app instead of
00:41 - just my app so now this Cavey file won't
00:44 - actually load incorrectly if we remember
00:46 - the naming conventions from before so
00:49 - what I want to do is only use something
00:50 - called a builder which will allow us to
00:52 - load in the KB file no matter what the
00:55 - name of it is so let's just start by
00:56 - importing it so I leave us from K V dot
00:58 - Lang we're gonna import builder and then
01:02 - what we're gonna do is just type right
01:03 - above our class we'll say K V equals
01:05 - builder if I could type load underscore
01:11 - file believe that's the name and then
01:13 - what we'll do is put the name of our
01:15 - file so my dot K V and what we're gonna
01:17 - do now is we're just gonna return K V
01:20 - from this my main app so essentially
01:23 - what this is gonna do is this she's
01:24 - gonna load up this file it doesn't
01:25 - matter what the name of this file is now
01:27 - and we're gonna return this file when
01:30 - we're building the app so like let's
01:32 - just do an example here if I say button
01:34 - and I say text and we'll just go like
01:38 - Tim and to see if this works just to
01:42 - test and there we go we see we get a
01:43 - button Tim and again because we're
01:45 - loading up this KB fall it's the way
01:47 - this builder thing works just you don't
01:48 - have to name your K V file like the same
01:50 - thing as the class ok so that's it for
01:53 - Builder so what we're gonna do now is
01:55 - since we're setting up screens we
01:57 - actually have to use something from
01:59 - Kibby which is well screens and screen
02:01 - managers what we're gonna do is going to
02:02 - say from Kivi dot UI x dot screen
02:07 - manager import screen manager and import
02:10 - screen so we're gonna set up three
02:12 - classes
02:13 - and they're not gonna have anything
02:14 - inside of them but they're just gonna
02:15 - dictate our different screens and then
02:17 - our screen manager so our first class
02:19 - will be our first window so I'm just
02:21 - gonna say this main window okay and this
02:24 - is just gonna inherit from screen and
02:26 - then all we have to do in here is just
02:28 - pass now I'll actually copy this and
02:30 - paste this and instead of having main
02:33 - window we'll do second window and then
02:36 - we'll paste this one more time and
02:38 - against the main window we're gonna do
02:41 - what is it window manager the names of
02:45 - these don't really matter as long as you
02:47 - remember what they are and that instead
02:49 - of screen we're gonna do screen manager
02:51 - okay screen manager so essentially what
02:55 - this is gonna do now is this is gonna
02:56 - represent our main window which is our
02:58 - login form this will represent the page
02:59 - we go to next and this window manager
03:02 - will just represent like the transitions
03:05 - and stuff between the windows okay so
03:08 - what we're gonna do now is what we will
03:10 - I think we may be done actually for the
03:12 - Python file so let's move over to the kV
03:14 - file and start setting some stuff up so
03:17 - the first thing we need to do is we're
03:18 - just gonna grab this window manager and
03:21 - we're gonna set what type of screens are
03:23 - what screens are going to be inside of
03:24 - this so the two screens we have our main
03:27 - window okay and then we also have a
03:30 - second window right so we'll put those
03:32 - in here like that and just leave these
03:36 - as you need a colon here and we're not
03:37 - gonna type anything else but you just
03:39 - need the colon because there is possible
03:40 - options you could put so this right now
03:42 - is just saying we're gonna have two
03:44 - windows main window in second window if
03:45 - you wanted to add a third window you do
03:47 - something like third window here if I
03:51 - could type this and yeah then that's how
03:54 - you do that
03:55 - but you'd also have to make sure that
03:57 - you have a third window class here and I
03:58 - think you guys probably get the point so
04:00 - what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna
04:01 - start creating the kind of forms for our
04:03 - different windows now this is really
04:04 - similar to what we've done before except
04:06 - we just need to add a few other things
04:08 - to it so essentially what we're gonna do
04:09 - is gonna go May in the window like this
04:12 - and then in here what we'll put is uh
04:15 - first need to give it a name now the
04:17 - name is gonna be how we what do you call
04:20 - it call it in terms of moving between
04:22 - screens so the name of this one we'll
04:24 - just call this main now we'll even just
04:26 - we'll just
04:26 - the second window right now so we don't
04:27 - forget so second window and it's for the
04:31 - name here we'll just do second okay now
04:35 - again these names can be whatever you
04:36 - want just make sure you remember them
04:38 - because we are gonna have to use them so
04:39 - name main names second now all I'm gonna
04:41 - do in the second window notice - it's
04:43 - already here is just create a button and
04:44 - on my button all I'm gonna do is just
04:46 - have some text and that Texas is gonna
04:49 - say go back right because if we make it
04:51 - to this screen then we just want to be
04:54 - able to navigate back to the other
04:55 - screen so that's what we need for second
04:57 - window now for main window I want to set
04:59 - up this login form that essentially all
05:01 - it does is is just gonna have like a
05:04 - label a text input box and then a button
05:06 - so we're gonna do this similar to what
05:08 - we've done before with multiple grid
05:10 - layouts so in case you forget we're
05:11 - gonna do a grid layout and then for the
05:14 - first grid layout we're gonna have calls
05:15 - is one okay and then what should we put
05:19 - inside here we need to put another grid
05:21 - layout so the other grid layout will be
05:23 - calls too
05:25 - and then inside here we're gonna have a
05:27 - label and Wow okay I don't know what I
05:30 - just clicked to do that that was
05:32 - interesting and we'll say text and for
05:34 - this we'll just say is password okay
05:37 - colon and then we'll put a text input
05:40 - box and we're gonna need to give this an
05:42 - ID so the ID for this I'll just say is
05:44 - passed W okay and then in here what
05:47 - we'll do is we'll say for text input
05:50 - multi-line equals false okay so that's
05:55 - all we need for here now we actually
05:57 - know we need to add a button sorry give
05:59 - me on that one so add a button and this
06:01 - button is just gonna have a text that
06:02 - says submit and we're gonna have an on
06:06 - press event which were actually on
06:08 - release event which we'll do in just a
06:10 - second and we're gonna have a non
06:11 - release event here so let's just do that
06:13 - so we don't forget let's do a quick
06:14 - summary of what we've done so
06:16 - essentially this is all like this is
06:17 - probably a review except for this part
06:19 - here of what we've done before so we
06:21 - just created a very basic form all we're
06:23 - going to do is we have what do you call
06:25 - it the text input which is going to just
06:28 - ask you for a password you can type and
06:29 - password and then we're just gonna check
06:31 - here if the password is a certain value
06:33 - and if it is then we're going to
06:34 - transition to the other window so the
06:36 - way that we transition to the other
06:38 - windows is we
06:39 - you this we do app JA root dot current
06:44 - okay and then we set it equal to the
06:47 - window we want to go to so in this case
06:49 - if we hit submit we want to go to the
06:50 - second window that that is this right
06:52 - now the name of that window is second
06:54 - like we named it here so that's all
06:56 - we're gonna do we're gonna say app dot
06:57 - root current equals second now we can
07:00 - actually copy this and we can paste it
07:02 - right here as well and here though if we
07:05 - want to go back we won't want to do the
07:07 - name main so that's what we'll do and
07:09 - actually let's just tab this in here
07:11 - underneath on release and this should be
07:13 - working fine so let's run this quickly
07:16 - and assuming I didn't make any mistakes
07:17 - which I probably did we should be
07:19 - working invalid property property name
07:21 - multi-line I can't do equals false I
07:25 - have to do : false believe that's the
07:28 - issue yes there we go okay so we have a
07:31 - little login window make it a bit
07:33 - smaller you can see it resizes so I'd
07:35 - type something in here hit submit and
07:37 - you can see it brings me over to my
07:39 - other page and then if I hit go back it
07:42 - brings me back now notice though that
07:44 - these transitions are probably not ideal
07:46 - moving like left right or just keep
07:48 - moving to the left but we want to go
07:49 - left and then to the right so how do we
07:51 - do that well luckily there is a way that
07:53 - we can do that so on the release here
07:56 - what we're actually gonna type in type
07:58 - root dot manager dot transition assuming
08:04 - I spell this correctly so root dot
08:06 - manager dot transition dot direction and
08:10 - then this is gonna be equal to what
08:13 - direction I wanted ghost in this case
08:14 - we're gonna go left okay and then if we
08:16 - copy this and we paste it here we can go
08:19 - right so now let's check this out and
08:22 - see if I did this correctly okay so if I
08:25 - hit submit you can see removing to the
08:27 - left now watch this if I hit go back we
08:29 - move to the right so you can see that
08:30 - it's kind of going back and forth and
08:32 - that's awesome okay so the last thing I
08:34 - want to do for this video is I want to
08:36 - make it so it only lets us go to the
08:37 - next page if we type this password
08:39 - correctly right so how can we do that
08:41 - well we just need to do a little bit of
08:44 - logic inside of here
08:46 - so the reason we gave this an idea so
08:48 - that we can check the value so on on
08:49 - release here let's go in here and let's
08:51 - do a bit of logic
08:52 - let's just say if or we'll say second if
08:56 - and I will say Pass W dot txt equals
09:01 - equals and let's just make the password
09:02 - Tim in this case we'll say else we're
09:06 - just gonna stay on this main page so
09:08 - we'll go to second if the password is
09:10 - Tim otherwise we'll go we'll just stay
09:12 - on the main page okay so let's try this
09:14 - if I hit submit I'm not typing a
09:17 - password it's not working if I type T I
09:18 - doesn't work if I type Tim you can see
09:22 - we go to the next page and that is
09:24 - essentially oh we should probably
09:26 - actually would want to clear this as
09:27 - well so we could do that too you know
09:31 - what let's not worry about that right
09:32 - now how am I do in the next video but
09:33 - essentially that's how that works
09:35 - this is how we can go between multiple
09:37 - windows if you want to create another
09:38 - window create another class inherit from
09:41 - screen same thing here and then you can
09:44 - kind of lay out the navigation for
09:45 - yourself so if you guys enjoyed the
09:47 - video please make sure you leave a like
09:49 - and subscribe and I will see you again
09:50 - in another one

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back from the kV tutorial so in today's video we're gonna be going through how to change screens so essentially having multiple windows and then doing some kind of transition between them based on like an event occurs so the exact example that I'm gonna be using is we're gonna have a login form and if you type in the password correctly it'll move you to the next page if not then obviously it won't move you there so this is actually quite a few steps so make sure you guys follow along closely and as always all the code will be up on tech with Tim net ok so what we're actually gonna start by doing is something different that we haven't done yet so notice that I change the name of my main app I've just deleted essentially everything there's nothing in my KB file to my main app instead of just my app so now this Cavey file won't actually load incorrectly if we remember the naming conventions from before so what I want to do is only use something called a builder which will allow us to load in the KB file no matter what the name of it is so let's just start by importing it so I leave us from K V dot Lang we're gonna import builder and then what we're gonna do is just type right above our class we'll say K V equals builder if I could type load underscore file believe that's the name and then what we'll do is put the name of our file so my dot K V and what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna return K V from this my main app so essentially what this is gonna do is this she's gonna load up this file it doesn't matter what the name of this file is now and we're gonna return this file when we're building the app so like let's just do an example here if I say button and I say text and we'll just go like Tim and to see if this works just to test and there we go we see we get a button Tim and again because we're loading up this KB fall it's the way this builder thing works just you don't have to name your K V file like the same thing as the class ok so that's it for Builder so what we're gonna do now is since we're setting up screens we actually have to use something from Kibby which is well screens and screen managers what we're gonna do is going to say from Kivi dot UI x dot screen manager import screen manager and import screen so we're gonna set up three classes and they're not gonna have anything inside of them but they're just gonna dictate our different screens and then our screen manager so our first class will be our first window so I'm just gonna say this main window okay and this is just gonna inherit from screen and then all we have to do in here is just pass now I'll actually copy this and paste this and instead of having main window we'll do second window and then we'll paste this one more time and against the main window we're gonna do what is it window manager the names of these don't really matter as long as you remember what they are and that instead of screen we're gonna do screen manager okay screen manager so essentially what this is gonna do now is this is gonna represent our main window which is our login form this will represent the page we go to next and this window manager will just represent like the transitions and stuff between the windows okay so what we're gonna do now is what we will I think we may be done actually for the Python file so let's move over to the kV file and start setting some stuff up so the first thing we need to do is we're just gonna grab this window manager and we're gonna set what type of screens are what screens are going to be inside of this so the two screens we have our main window okay and then we also have a second window right so we'll put those in here like that and just leave these as you need a colon here and we're not gonna type anything else but you just need the colon because there is possible options you could put so this right now is just saying we're gonna have two windows main window in second window if you wanted to add a third window you do something like third window here if I could type this and yeah then that's how you do that but you'd also have to make sure that you have a third window class here and I think you guys probably get the point so what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna start creating the kind of forms for our different windows now this is really similar to what we've done before except we just need to add a few other things to it so essentially what we're gonna do is gonna go May in the window like this and then in here what we'll put is uh first need to give it a name now the name is gonna be how we what do you call it call it in terms of moving between screens so the name of this one we'll just call this main now we'll even just we'll just the second window right now so we don't forget so second window and it's for the name here we'll just do second okay now again these names can be whatever you want just make sure you remember them because we are gonna have to use them so name main names second now all I'm gonna do in the second window notice it's already here is just create a button and on my button all I'm gonna do is just have some text and that Texas is gonna say go back right because if we make it to this screen then we just want to be able to navigate back to the other screen so that's what we need for second window now for main window I want to set up this login form that essentially all it does is is just gonna have like a label a text input box and then a button so we're gonna do this similar to what we've done before with multiple grid layouts so in case you forget we're gonna do a grid layout and then for the first grid layout we're gonna have calls is one okay and then what should we put inside here we need to put another grid layout so the other grid layout will be calls too and then inside here we're gonna have a label and Wow okay I don't know what I just clicked to do that that was interesting and we'll say text and for this we'll just say is password okay colon and then we'll put a text input box and we're gonna need to give this an ID so the ID for this I'll just say is passed W okay and then in here what we'll do is we'll say for text input multiline equals false okay so that's all we need for here now we actually know we need to add a button sorry give me on that one so add a button and this button is just gonna have a text that says submit and we're gonna have an on press event which were actually on release event which we'll do in just a second and we're gonna have a non release event here so let's just do that so we don't forget let's do a quick summary of what we've done so essentially this is all like this is probably a review except for this part here of what we've done before so we just created a very basic form all we're going to do is we have what do you call it the text input which is going to just ask you for a password you can type and password and then we're just gonna check here if the password is a certain value and if it is then we're going to transition to the other window so the way that we transition to the other windows is we you this we do app JA root dot current okay and then we set it equal to the window we want to go to so in this case if we hit submit we want to go to the second window that that is this right now the name of that window is second like we named it here so that's all we're gonna do we're gonna say app dot root current equals second now we can actually copy this and we can paste it right here as well and here though if we want to go back we won't want to do the name main so that's what we'll do and actually let's just tab this in here underneath on release and this should be working fine so let's run this quickly and assuming I didn't make any mistakes which I probably did we should be working invalid property property name multiline I can't do equals false I have to do false believe that's the issue yes there we go okay so we have a little login window make it a bit smaller you can see it resizes so I'd type something in here hit submit and you can see it brings me over to my other page and then if I hit go back it brings me back now

can see we go to the next page and that is essentially oh we should probably actually would want to clear this as well so we could do that too you know what let's not worry about that right now how am I do in the next video but essentially that's how that works this is how we can go between multiple windows if you want to create another window create another class inherit from screen same thing
