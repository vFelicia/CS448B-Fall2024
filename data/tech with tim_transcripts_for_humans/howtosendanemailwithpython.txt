00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:03 - going to be showing you how to send
00:05 - emails from a Python script this is
00:07 - actually extremely simple it's not gonna
00:08 - take us very long but I'm just gonna be
00:10 - showing you very basic emails so just
00:11 - like plain text emails with a subject
00:13 - and a message line if you want some more
00:15 - advanced emails with like HTML and like
00:17 - making them look nice I can do that but
00:19 - I need you guys to let me know in the
00:21 - comments down below so anyways let's get
00:24 - started so this function you guys aren't
00:26 - going to need but I'm just using it to
00:28 - read in my email and password from a
00:30 - text file so that you guys can't see it
00:32 - but obviously on your own computer you
00:34 - can just type out your username and
00:36 - password or your email password when we
00:38 - get to that point
00:39 - I'm also importing SMTP Lib and SSL this
00:43 - is what we're gonna do to connect to the
00:44 - server so we can actually set an email
00:46 - so our first step is gonna be to define
00:48 - our username password and then who we're
00:52 - gonna send the email to so I'm gonna say
00:55 - sender is so sender password is equal to
01:00 - read creds now read creds simply returns
01:04 - to me obviously my username and the
01:06 - password now you guys can just type out
01:09 - like sender equals and then just put
01:11 - your gmail address here and then
01:12 - password is gonna be the password to
01:14 - that gmail account now I don't know how
01:16 - this works with two-factor
01:17 - authentication but if you're running
01:19 - into an issue with credentials it might
01:21 - be because your email accounts
01:22 - two-factor authenticated and you can't
01:23 - connect to it from here
01:24 - so in that case I would say maybe just
01:26 - create like a new email account that you
01:28 - want to send it from or disable the
01:30 - two-factor authentication at least for
01:32 - this example okay so now we're just
01:34 - gonna define receive and this will be
01:36 - equal to the email that you want to send
01:38 - it to now in my instance I'm just gonna
01:41 - actually send it to myself so to the
01:42 - sender so that I don't have to bother
01:44 - going into a new email account but for
01:45 - you guys you can literally just type any
01:47 - Gmail account or whatever other account
01:48 - you want in here and it should work as
01:50 - long as it's a valid address okay so our
01:53 - next thing is to define our message and
01:55 - this is what is obviously we're gonna be
01:56 - sending to the person so we're just
01:58 - gonna do a multi-line string here and
02:00 - I'm just gonna do this to define that
02:02 - we're going to the next line and we're
02:04 - gonna do subject colon and then whatever
02:08 - you want the subject to be so I'm just
02:09 - gonna say Python email tutorial
02:13 - in the mainline so this is actually
02:15 - gonna show up as the subject line for us
02:17 - this and then down here will be the
02:18 - message content so just say this is from
02:23 - Python exclamation point and we'll just
02:25 - say check with Tim as like the little
02:29 - goodbye message or whatever okay so we
02:32 - have that so we have our sender receiver
02:34 - message what else do we need we need to
02:36 - define a variable now it's called
02:38 - context and what this is gonna be as SSL
02:40 - dot pre 8 underscore default underscore
02:45 - context and we're gonna use this in a
02:47 - second you'll see why I'll explain let
02:49 - me just move up here and then down here
02:51 - what we're gonna do is we're going to
02:53 - actually connect to the server and send
02:55 - email we're almost actually done this is
02:57 - super fast so we'll just say with and
02:59 - then SMTP dot or not dot sorry Lib SMTP
03:05 - SM TP my bad guys underscore SSL and
03:09 - then in here we're gonna put our actual
03:11 - email server so in this case I'm using
03:14 - Gmail and I assume most of you will
03:15 - probably be using Gmail but if you're
03:17 - using like hotmail you're gonna have to
03:18 - find where that server is to put in here
03:20 - but I believe it's just smtp.gmail.com
03:25 - this is the email server we're going to
03:28 - connect to and send emails from now I
03:30 - don't know if you can use this with what
03:33 - do you call it other emails that aren't
03:35 - Gmail if that's your sender email but if
03:38 - you try it and it doesn't work then
03:40 - you'll have to find whatever this kind
03:42 - of SMTP thing for like hotmail or
03:44 - Outlook or whatever it is email that you
03:46 - have okay so next thing I'm going to do
03:49 - is I'm just gonna say a port and then
03:51 - context equals context and this reminds
03:54 - we actually up at the top here we got a
03:56 - defined port now so I'm just gonna say
03:58 - port is equal to four five six and this
04:01 - is just the standard port for SSL if
04:04 - this for some reason doesn't work then
04:06 - that probably means that your router is
04:08 - blocking the connection to SSL and in
04:10 - that case there's not really much you
04:12 - can do you can try to find another port
04:14 - on your router that accepts SSL or
04:16 - that's empty maybe but for now that's
04:19 - all I know is four five six so it works
04:21 - for me so we'll see if it works for you
04:22 - guys ok so after that
04:25 - we've kind of connected now we'll just
04:27 - say this is AZ server and sorry one
04:31 - second we're gonna say server dot login
04:34 - so just simply logging into our
04:36 - credentials so to login here I'm just
04:38 - gonna say sender and then password and
04:41 - then we're gonna say it server dot send
04:44 - email and then we're simply just gonna
04:46 - put our sender which is whose sending
04:48 - email our receiver which is who's gonna
04:51 - receive the email and then the message
04:52 - which is message and that should be
04:56 - about it I'm just gonna add some print
04:57 - statements in here quickly so we get a
04:58 - little bit of output to our console
05:00 - saying starting to send and then at the
05:04 - end here I'll just say print sent email
05:09 - just so we know you know if something
05:11 - hangs here and we run into an issue or
05:12 - if it's taking a long time to send the
05:14 - email so yeah that's pretty much what we
05:17 - do port 465 we'll just get your username
05:20 - and password again this is gonna be like
05:22 - your sender is gonna be your Gmail
05:24 - account so the exact address and then
05:26 - password is gonna be whatever the
05:27 - password is for that receive this is any
05:30 - email that you want to send it to
05:31 - message this is what you're gonna be
05:32 - sending context we just need this to
05:35 - create a new SSL thing not gonna explain
05:37 - exactly what that does and then we're
05:39 - just gonna open up a connection to the
05:41 - email server login with our credentials
05:43 - and simply send an email so let's run
05:45 - this now and see what happens no such
05:49 - followed Directory credentials txt okay
05:52 - so give me one second we'll create that
05:53 - directory and then I'll be right back
05:55 - okay so I just realized I made a really
05:57 - small mistake and essentially my file
05:59 - was just in the wrong directory but I
06:01 - also tried to run it and realize that we
06:03 - have two issues that I need to fix the
06:05 - first one here is down here this
06:06 - originally said past W I just had to
06:08 - change this to password so just add that
06:11 - Ord there because I figure out that I
06:12 - named this password and then here where
06:14 - it says send email we're gonna make this
06:15 - sent mail I don't know why I added that
06:18 - either but anyways that should be
06:20 - working now so if I run this we see
06:23 - starting to sent and then sent email you
06:25 - know that's great it's showing us this
06:27 - output but let me prove to you that
06:28 - actually did send that by opening up the
06:31 - email address here so you can see right
06:33 - now it's actually well I mean you guys
06:35 - can't really see the time but it is 814
06:37 - a.m. and you can see that we've just
06:38 - received an email
06:39 - it says tests anymo this is just
06:42 - whatever the email I'm using this is
06:44 - from Python and then it signs it with
06:45 - tech with Tim and if you go to my sent
06:48 - mail you can see that it was sent from
06:49 - this address and received here as well
06:51 - so that is essentially how you send an
06:54 - email with python really straightforward
06:56 - really basic if you guys have any
06:58 - questions or anything snot working
06:59 - please let me know in the description
07:00 - below and with that being said I will
07:02 - see you again in a new video
07:04 - [Music]
