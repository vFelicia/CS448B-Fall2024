00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so what
00:02 - we're gonna be doing in this video is
00:03 - doing a review for the BenQ screen bar
00:06 - plus which is a more affordable version
00:08 - of the Ben QE reading lamp which I
00:10 - talked about in a previous video
00:12 - now another bonus for you guys here in a
00:13 - massive thank you to Ben Q once again
00:15 - for sponsoring this video and for
00:16 - sponsoring the giveaway that I'm about
00:18 - to talk about is I'm actually gonna be
00:20 - giving away a Ben QE reading lamp now
00:23 - these are very expensive high-quality
00:25 - lamps I have one sitting right there you
00:27 - can kind of see just the edges of it but
00:29 - this is valued at almost 300 dollars and
00:31 - they're gonna be giving it away to one
00:32 - of you lucky viewers so make sure you
00:34 - guys stay tuned throughout the video to
00:35 - learn how to enter that giveaway and
00:38 - with that being said let's get into the
00:39 - review and talk about the screen bar
00:41 - plus now the way that I like to describe
00:43 - the screen bar plus is an intelligent
00:45 - lightbar
00:46 - now this light bar sits on top of your
00:48 - monitor and projects light downwards and
00:50 - outwards now this light is anti glare
00:52 - which means you don't see anything on
00:54 - your monitor and the whole point of it
00:55 - is to provide accurate and sufficient
00:57 - lighting to help you look at your
00:59 - monitor screen for longer so this is
01:00 - advertised as an ear eating lamp which
01:03 - essentially means that it's designed to
01:05 - save your eyes now if you guys are like
01:07 - me and you sit at your computer screen
01:08 - for 6 to 7 hours a day then you know
01:10 - that this can have a massive effect on
01:12 - your eyesight and it's not difficult to
01:14 - strain and stress your eyes out now the
01:16 - great features of this lamp is that it
01:17 - takes up hardly any room because of
01:19 - where it sits on your screen and it's
01:20 - fully adjustable like you guys are
01:22 - seeing me use now so you can adjust both
01:23 - the temperature and the brightness of
01:25 - the lamp which means that you can kind
01:27 - of change from a nice cold light when
01:29 - you're trying to get some work done to a
01:30 - nice warm reading light now another
01:32 - standout feature here is the automatic
01:34 - sensing this light has I'll talk about
01:36 - it a little bit in the future but
01:37 - essentially what it does is sense the
01:39 - light in the room and automatically
01:41 - adjust the light temperature and
01:42 - brightness to fit that so this is the
01:44 - main controller for the lamp and this
01:46 - allows you to toggle all of the
01:48 - different settings so to turn the light
01:49 - on and off to change the temperature
01:51 - which I just did there and then to
01:52 - change the brightness the way you
01:54 - typically do it is you set your
01:55 - temperature and then you can kind of
01:56 - tweak the brightness from there and this
01:58 - is the automatic sensing I'm talking
02:00 - about where you hit this green button
02:01 - here it lights up and it automatically
02:03 - changes the temperature and brightness
02:05 - accordingly toggling the lamp is pretty
02:07 - easy you just press down on the main
02:08 - kind of spinner there and that is all
02:11 - there is to it
02:12 - now this
02:12 - the light sitting above the monitors we
02:14 - just want to give you guys an idea of
02:15 - kind of what it looks like from below
02:16 - but when you are looking at your monitor
02:18 - you can't actually see that little light
02:20 - aspect there because the light is
02:21 - projected directly downwards unless you
02:24 - tilted a few degrees out which I showed
02:25 - in the previous clip so here we're just
02:28 - gonna talk about some of the parts and
02:29 - kind of putting together this lamp so
02:31 - this is the counterweight that actually
02:32 - sits at the back of your monitor it's
02:34 - extremely adjustable I have a bunch of
02:36 - different monitors I've tried it on I
02:37 - haven't had any issues getting this
02:38 - light on now all you do is essentially
02:40 - just clip that light bar into there and
02:42 - that's all there is to it this is the
02:44 - main controller we've kind of already
02:45 - talked about this a bit it has a nice
02:47 - rubber pad on the back to kind of keep
02:49 - it from slipping and it does look
02:50 - actually decent on the desk in my
02:52 - opinion now the nice thing about this
02:54 - lamp is it actually would be powered
02:56 - from like a monitor or a keyboard or
02:58 - even your computer it uses one USB for
03:00 - the power and then I believe that's a
03:02 - micro USB that just plugs into the back
03:04 - of the lamp so this is really nice
03:05 - because you don't actually need to run
03:06 - this into a wall outlet although you can
03:09 - if you want and you can just plug it
03:10 - into the computer and then whatever your
03:11 - computer's on your light will actually
03:13 - turn on as well obviously with the
03:15 - toggle so I just want to show you guys
03:17 - here how you kind of attach this it's
03:18 - very easy you just kind of clip it on
03:20 - the back you can adjust that
03:21 - counterweight like I'm doing now and
03:23 - just clip it right on to the monitor I
03:25 - haven't had any issues getting this on
03:27 - and even on a curved monitor which this
03:28 - is it actually works fine now one of the
03:31 - few complaints I do have about this lamp
03:32 - is the length of the cable that comes
03:34 - with it now it should be fine for most
03:36 - people that use this but personally for
03:38 - me I have my lamp on the other side of
03:40 - my desk from where my computers and it's
03:42 - actually not long enough for me to
03:43 - stretch and plug in both the lamp and
03:45 - the USB into my computer so I've had to
03:47 - run it into a little power brick that I
03:49 - plug into the wall outlet that I have
03:50 - down below but just a small
03:52 - inconvenience that I figured I'd mention
03:53 - in case you guys have a massive really
03:55 - long set up this might not work
03:56 - perfectly for you now what you're
03:59 - looking at right now is a clip of my
04:00 - desk with only the screen bar plus light
04:02 - on now I have this on my secondary
04:04 - monitor but I'm trying to illustrate to
04:06 - you how much light actually comes off
04:08 - from this now this is really nice
04:10 - because for me as a student what I
04:11 - usually end up doing is writing
04:13 - something while looking at my computer
04:14 - screen so by being able to have this
04:17 - lighting kind of adjust it out to where
04:18 - my paper might be I can actually write
04:20 - and see what I'm writing while I look at
04:22 - my computer screen without having a
04:23 - glare
04:24 - from a lamp which you would usually get
04:26 - just a quick warning here be careful
04:28 - when purchasing this lamp if you do have
04:30 - a webcam I mean it's pretty
04:31 - straightforward you can see here
04:32 - essentially this lamp is gonna block the
04:34 - webcam unless you move it kind of to the
04:36 - very edge of your monitor or a different
04:37 - location just want to make sure you guys
04:39 - were aware of that so you didn't buy
04:40 - this lamp and realize that now your
04:42 - webcam can't actually see anything based
04:44 - on the location it's in so now time for
04:46 - some of my final thoughts about this
04:47 - lamp now to be transparent I did receive
04:50 - this lamp for free as a review unit but
04:52 - it does retail for 129 US dollars and
04:55 - you can find it on Amazon at the link
04:57 - below now in terms of kind of wrapping
04:59 - up this video here I will say that this
05:01 - lamp definitely does make a difference
05:03 - I've been skeptical about whether these
05:05 - products really work but after using
05:07 - them for about a month now I can
05:08 - definitely say that it does make a
05:10 - difference and I notice a huge
05:12 - difference when I go to a monitor that
05:13 - doesn't have this kind of lighting setup
05:15 - and even just in terms of lighting up
05:17 - the working area of my desk it's been
05:19 - really nice and I really am glad that
05:21 - BenQ reached out to me to do this kind
05:23 - of partnership in sponsorship so anyways
05:25 - with that being said if you guys do have
05:26 - the budget for this lamp I would
05:27 - definitely recommend it and I think it's
05:29 - a worthwhile investment in your eyesight
05:31 - and just kind of in the future of
05:33 - looking at your monitor screen alright
05:35 - so now it's time to talk about the part
05:36 - that you guys probably clicked on this
05:38 - video for which is the giveaway so I'm
05:40 - gonna be giving away one BenQ e reading
05:43 - lamp obviously thanks to Ben Q so
05:46 - they've sponsored this video and this
05:47 - giveaway so a massive thank you to them
05:49 - you can check out both their products in
05:50 - the link in the description but anyways
05:52 - if you want to enter the giveaway
05:53 - listing closely because there are a few
05:55 - kind of rules that you need to follow so
