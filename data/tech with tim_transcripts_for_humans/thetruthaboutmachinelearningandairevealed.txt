00:00 - so let's begin here by walking through
00:01 - the steps that's involved in training a
00:03 - machine learning model or really
00:05 - developing some kind of artificial
00:06 - intelligence very little of what you're
00:08 - going to do as a machine learning
00:10 - engineer is actually building machine
00:12 - learning models or artificial
00:13 - intelligence most of your work is not
00:15 - going to be training a model coming up
00:17 - with a model architecture and doing all
00:18 - of that fun stuff you might see in
00:20 - YouTube videos or hear about In Articles
00:22 - a lot of it is going to have to do with
00:23 - data collecting data processing data and
00:25 - then testing and evaluating your model
00:27 - and continuing to repeat that process
00:29 - until you hit a point that you are
00:31 - satisfied with this is not as glorious
00:33 - and as glamorous as a field as you might
00:35 - make it out to be and there's a lot of
00:36 - very frustrating time consuming and
00:38 - difficult work that goes into actually
00:40 - being successful in training machine
00:42 - learning models and creating artificial
