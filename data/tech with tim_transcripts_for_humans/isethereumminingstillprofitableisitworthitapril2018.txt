00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:03 - youtube video so in today's video i am
00:05 - going to be talking about ethereum
00:07 - mining now uh ethereum mining about a
00:10 - year ago when i started doing it about
00:11 - then uh was really popular and it was
00:14 - fairly profitable you could make back
00:16 - your initial investment in only a few
00:18 - months
00:19 - as time has gone on that has increased
00:22 - so if you bought a mining rig recently
00:24 - you'll know that it's going to take a
00:25 - long time
00:27 - to make back that initial investment and
00:29 - that ethereum mining is not as
00:30 - profitable anymore so i'm gonna be
00:32 - talking about in this video is it still
00:34 - profitable
00:35 - and should you still be mining now this
00:38 - obviously this answer varies depending
00:39 - on your situation uh for example for me
00:42 - i already have a mining rig
00:44 - i already have the graphics cards so i
00:46 - might as well just mine uh to make that
00:49 - profit whereas someone who's just coming
00:51 - in maybe they only have one graphics
00:52 - card they're thinking about making an
00:54 - ethereum mining rig it's probably not
00:56 - going to be very profitable to do that
00:57 - i'm going to talk about why in this
00:58 - video so there's a bunch of factors we
01:00 - need to consider when we're talking
01:01 - about the profitability of ethereum
01:04 - mining now you can just go ahead uh and
01:06 - this is a simple way to do it and go to
01:07 - cryptocompare.com and go to this
01:09 - ethereum mining profitability calculator
01:12 - and you could punch in your hash power
01:14 - your cost per uh i always just put zero
01:16 - as my power consumption because i don't
01:18 - pay power because i still live with my
01:19 - parents and then you can do like your
01:21 - pool fee all this stuff and figure out
01:23 - how much money you're approximately
01:24 - gonna make in us dollars per month per
01:26 - week
01:27 - per year etc now looking at this
01:30 - obviously this is very low for 20
01:33 - mega hash per second if i punch this in
01:35 - a few months ago this number would have
01:36 - been about three or four times higher
01:38 - and that's because of the price of
01:39 - ethereum
01:40 - so if you're just going off this then
01:42 - obviously these numbers don't look very
01:43 - promising 200 that's not even gonna
01:45 - cover the cost of um what do you call it
01:48 - i don't know my power supply and my ram
01:50 - for a mining rig so what's the point of
01:53 - mining with that if i go to 100 megahash
01:55 - per second you can see we're making
01:56 - about a thousand dollars but still if
01:58 - you have 100 megahash per second that
01:59 - means you have four or five pretty
02:01 - powerful graphics cards that's
02:02 - definitely not even covering the price
02:03 - of maybe two or three of them so right
02:05 - now if you're looking to buy a rig it's
02:07 - definitely not a time that you'd be uh
02:10 - that you should be going into ethereum
02:12 - mining now
02:14 - the reason why if you already have
02:15 - hardware it's somewhat worth still
02:17 - mining is because if we're looking at
02:19 - the price here we're comparing we're
02:21 - assuming that ethereum is going to stay
02:22 - at a price of 375 dollars now if i go to
02:26 - the ethereum charts here uh you can see
02:28 - that the price obviously has been
02:30 - plummeting recently but if we
02:32 - expect or if you think that ethereum is
02:35 - going to pull back up to maybe even just
02:37 - like the 700 range the 900 range then
02:40 - mining now and holding on to your
02:42 - ethereum may not be a bad idea
02:44 - it's also worth it because you can get
02:46 - your ethereum and then you're able to
02:47 - buy other cryptocurrency with that uh
02:49 - while you're mining it so that's
02:50 - personally why i'm still mining um i
02:52 - just leave my computer running for i
02:54 - think like when i go to beds like 12
02:55 - hours a day just to pick up a bit of
02:57 - ethereum so i can be buying uh other
02:59 - cryptocurrency now don't get me wrong
03:01 - it's not extremely
03:03 - profitable right now but if and if i
03:05 - hold on to my ethereum for long enough
03:07 - and we see it go back up
03:09 - higher then it will be worth it for
03:10 - right now now the reason why uh the
03:13 - profitability has been going down is
03:15 - because of this chart here that i'm
03:17 - showing you now this is the block
03:18 - difficulty growth chart and you can see
03:21 - that back in even just january of last
03:24 - year um we were having an average
03:26 - difficulty of about 90 okay so you don't
03:28 - really have to know what this number
03:29 - means but just you can look at the
03:31 - magnitude of it so at 90 this is when
03:34 - not very many people were mining the
03:35 - ethereum network was just kind of
03:36 - starting out uh getting a bit more
03:38 - popular as we moved again into april
03:40 - we're moving up we're moving up and when
03:42 - i started mining was about the 650 range
03:46 - 600 range and i was making a good amount
03:48 - of money i made back uh the money on my
03:50 - mining rig in i don't know i think five
03:52 - or six months so it was definitely worth
03:54 - mining at the time but then you can see
03:56 - that we're just climbing climbing
03:58 - climbing climbing and from that 60 at
03:59 - the beginning of the year we're now at 3
04:01 - 000.
04:02 - so you can see it's becoming much more
04:04 - difficult to mine ethereum and what that
04:06 - means is that it takes longer
04:08 - to mine one full block which means
04:10 - you're making less money you're getting
04:12 - less rewards
04:13 - for the work that you're doing
04:16 - and
04:16 - pretty much you can see now we're at 3
04:18 - 200 about i mean right now we're at
04:20 - 31.76 it's fluctuating just a bit um but
04:24 - that's not very
04:25 - profitable at all especially at the
04:27 - price of ethereum
04:28 - to try to be mining at this difficulty
04:30 - with just basic graphics cards and not
04:32 - asic hardware um you're not going to be
04:35 - making too much money so that's what
04:37 - kind of why
04:39 - the
04:40 - you're not going to be making as much
04:41 - money it's not going to be as profitable
04:42 - because as a network continues and grows
04:45 - uh the difficulty gets well more
04:46 - difficult we can look again at the
04:48 - bitcoin charts here so i'll try to try
04:49 - to find a chart bitcoin
04:52 - difficulty mining
04:55 - see if something comes up for this
04:57 - difficulty and hash rate trick and yeah
04:59 - again you can see here just climbing and
05:01 - climbing and climbing uh and the similar
05:03 - thing happens uh is happening to
05:06 - ethereum now because if you were to try
05:07 - to mine bitcoin from well your uh pc
05:11 - then uh that's not gonna be making you
05:12 - very much money and that's what's
05:14 - happening with ethereum now i'm trying
05:15 - to find a better chart here to show you
05:17 - guys uh this is a better looking one
05:19 - okay so i don't know okay this ranges
05:21 - from let's start at about 2015 and you
05:24 - can see the exponential growth of the
05:26 - network and a similar thing is happening
05:28 - again with ethereum and the difficulty
05:30 - here you can see that if we're looking
05:32 - from january 17th this definitely is an
05:34 - exponential curve
05:35 - and it's just going to continue to get
05:36 - more difficult from here on
05:39 - so overall um kind of the consensus here
05:41 - or the
05:43 - final statement is if you're looking to
05:45 - get into mining now and you don't
05:47 - already have the hardware it's
05:48 - definitely not a time to be buying any
05:50 - of that hardware if you really want to
05:52 - think about ethereum mining or mining
05:54 - i'd think about a different currency
05:55 - maybe mining something like litecoin or
05:57 - zed cash i'm not sure how profitable
05:59 - those are but they can't be much worse
06:01 - than ethereum
06:03 - right now at this current price it's
06:05 - worth just holding on to your ethereum
06:07 - if you are mining um and waiting for it
06:09 - to hopefully go back up or maybe buying
06:11 - other cryptocurrency with it but it's
06:13 - definitely not a time to be getting
06:14 - heavily invested in any mining
06:16 - whatsoever or to be looking to buying
06:19 - buy any mining hardware if anything
06:21 - cloud mining may be a better option for
06:24 - for yourself but
06:26 - yeah really mining theorem right now
06:27 - it's not very profitable and i wouldn't
06:29 - recommend it unless you already have the
06:30 - hardware and it's just sitting around
06:32 - there especially if you're not paying
06:34 - electricity so that's been it for this

hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video so in today's video i am going to be talking about ethereum mining now uh ethereum mining about a year ago when i started doing it about then uh was really popular and it was fairly profitable you could make back your initial investment in only a few months as time has gone on that has increased so if you bought a mining rig recently you'll know that it's going to take a long time to make back that initial investment and that ethereum mining is not as profitable anymore so i'm gonna be talking about in this video is it still profitable and should you still be mining now this obviously this answer varies depending on your situation uh for example for me i already have a mining rig i already have the graphics cards so i might as well just mine uh to make that profit whereas someone who's just coming in maybe they only have one graphics card they're thinking about making an ethereum mining rig it's probably not going to be very profitable to do that i'm going to talk about why in this video so there's a bunch of factors we need to consider when we're talking about the profitability of ethereum mining now you can just go ahead uh and this is a simple way to do it and go to cryptocompare.com and go to this ethereum mining profitability calculator and you could punch in your hash power your cost per uh i always just put zero as my power consumption because i don't pay power because i still live with my parents and then you can do like your pool fee all this stuff and figure out how much money you're approximately gonna make in us dollars per month per week per year etc now looking at this obviously this is very low for 20 mega hash per second if i punch this in a few months ago this number would have been about three or four times higher and that's because of the price of ethereum so if you're just going off this then obviously these numbers don't look very promising 200 that's not even gonna cover the cost of um what do you call it i don't know my power supply and my ram for a mining rig so what's the point of mining with that if i go to 100 megahash per second you can see we're making about a

them so right now if you're looking to buy a rig it's definitely not a time that you'd be uh that you should be going into ethereum mining now the reason why if you already have hardware it's somewhat

that's personally why i'm still mining um i just leave my computer running for i think like when i go to beds like 12 hours a day just to pick up a bit of ethereum so i can be buying uh other cryptocurrency now don't get me wrong it's not extremely profitable right now but if and if i hold on to my ethereum for long enough and we see it go back up higher then it will be worth it for right now now the reason why uh the profitability has been going down is because of this chart here that i'm showing you now this is the block difficulty growth chart and you can see that back in even just january of last year um we were having an average difficulty of about 90 okay so you don't really have to know what this number means but just you can look at the magnitude of it so at 90 this is when not very many people were mining the ethereum network was just kind of starting out uh getting a bit more popular as we moved again into april we're moving up we're moving up and when i started mining was about the 650 range 600 range and i was making a good amount of money i made back uh the money on my mining rig in i don't know i think five or six months so it was definitely worth mining at the time but then you can see that we're just climbing climbing climbing climbing and from that 60 at the beginning of the year we're now at 3 000. so you can see it's becoming much more difficult to mine ethereum and what that means is that it takes longer to mine one full block which means you're making less money you're getting less rewards for the work that you're doing and pretty much you can see now we're at 3 200 about i mean right now we're at 31.76 it's fluctuating just a bit um but that's not very profitable at all especially at the price of ethereum to try to be mining at this difficulty with just basic graphics cards and not asic hardware um you're not going to be making too much money so that's what kind of why the you're not going to be making as much money it's not going to be as profitable because as a network continues and grows uh the difficulty gets well more difficult we can look again at the bitcoin charts here so i'll try to try to find a chart bitcoin difficulty mining see if something comes up for this difficulty and hash rate trick and yeah again you can see here just climbing and climbing and climbing uh and the similar thing happens uh is happening to ethereum now because if you were to try to mine bitcoin from well your uh pc then uh that's not gonna be making you very much money and that's what's happening with ethereum now i'm trying to find a better chart here to show you guys uh this is a better looking one okay so i don't know okay this ranges from let's start at about 2015 and you can see the exponential growth of the network and a similar thing is happening again with ethereum and the difficulty here you can see that if we're looking from january 17th this definitely is an exponential curve and it's just going to continue to get more
