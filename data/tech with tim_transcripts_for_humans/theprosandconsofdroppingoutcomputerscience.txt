00:17 - safety net you can't really go wrong by
00:19 - having one but at the same time anything

00:28 - space for a large tech company I've been

00:43 - years and twenty five thousand dollars
00:45 - but at the same time I can always go
00:47 - back and complete the degree if I want
00:48 - to and that's kind of what really pushed
00:50 - me to make the decision is that if I
00:52 - ever really do need this I can go back
00:54 - and complete it
