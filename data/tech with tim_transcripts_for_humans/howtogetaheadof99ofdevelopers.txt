With timestamps:

00:00 - this is how you get ahead of 99% of
00:04 - [Music]
00:06 - developers step one be language agnostic
00:10 - the top developers can write code in any
00:12 - language even if they've never used that
00:14 - language before the reason for that is
00:16 - they have experience with multiple
00:18 - programming languages specifically
00:20 - languages of different styles and
00:22 - paradigms they understand strong typing
00:25 - static typing Dynamic typing weak typing
00:28 - and they know the different paradigms of
00:29 - language anges like procedural logical
00:32 - functional objectoriented and really how
00:34 - programming languages are designed and
00:37 - the different features that are similar
00:38 - across languages of different types this
00:41 - means that it doesn't matter what
00:42 - language they need to use they can very
00:44 - quickly learn it adapt and be very
00:47 - flexible this is exactly who you want to
00:49 - be that means you should get experience
00:51 - with as many languages as you possibly
00:53 - can you don't need to be an expert in
00:55 - them but if you know different types of
00:57 - languages it's really going to set you
00:58 - apart that's exact exactly why we teach
01:00 - multiple programming languages in my
01:02 - brand new software development course
01:04 - which you can check out from the link in
01:05 - the
01:07 - [Music]
01:09 - description now step two is to
01:11 - specialize if you want to stand out you
01:14 - really need to be an expert in one
01:16 - certain area of programming now that
01:18 - could be a language but more
01:19 - specifically probably a framework a
01:21 - certain type of development like backend
01:23 - frontend devops Etc if you can be really
01:26 - really good in one area it's going to
01:28 - set you apart and there's going to be
01:29 - lot of roles that you'll actually be the
01:31 - ideal candidate for that's exactly why
01:34 - in my software development course after
01:36 - you go through the fundamentals course
01:37 - Top by myself you pick a specialization
01:40 - in front end backend or devops if you
01:42 - want to check it out again from the link
01:43 - in the
01:45 - [Music]
01:47 - description now step three is to stay
01:49 - current if you want to be a top
01:51 - developer you constantly need to be on
01:53 - top of what's going on in the industry
01:54 - you need to know the new languages and
01:56 - Frameworks you need to be up to date
01:58 - with things like Ai and new tools tools
02:00 - and development strategies if you can do
02:02 - this it's going to set you apart and if
02:04 - you don't do this you're really just
02:05 - going to fall slowly behind think about
02:07 - a developer who doesn't utilize chat gbt
02:10 - today they just can't keep up with
02:11 - developers that do that's why if you
02:13 - want to be a top 1% developer you need
02:16 - to stay current and up to-date with
02:17 - what's going on in the
02:19 - [Music]
02:22 - industry step number four is to have a
02:24 - strong portfolio but even more
02:26 - importantly to have a portfolio that's
02:28 - easy to navigate easy to understand it
02:31 - doesn't matter if you have the most
02:32 - complex backend library that you've
02:34 - written if people can't understand that
02:36 - clearly and they can't access it view it
02:39 - install it Etc it's not going to matter
02:41 - right that's why some of the best
02:42 - portfolios are just a really clean
02:44 - landing page a great portfolio website
02:47 - obviously stands out a bit more if
02:49 - you're a front-end web developer but
02:50 - even if you're a back-end developer you
02:52 - do devop stuff doesn't matter I'd highly
02:54 - recommend having a really slick clean
02:57 - website or at least something that has a
02:59 - huge wow factor to it right in my case
03:02 - it's a YouTube channel I'll Point people
03:04 - to my YouTube they'll see I have 1.3
03:05 - million subscribers wow right that's an
03:08 - immediate thing that makes me stand out
03:10 - and shows okay this guy probably knows
03:12 - what he's talking about in your case you
03:13 - need to have something like that it can
03:15 - take any form you want but if I were to
03:17 - click on some link that you sent me I
03:19 - should immediately be blown away and
03:21 - know without a shadow of a doubt that
03:23 - you're a great developer because of the
03:24 - work or the portfolio that you've just
03:26 - showed
03:28 - me
03:31 - step number five time management I think
03:33 - this is pretty obvious but as you climb
03:35 - the ranks it's going to be expected that
03:37 - you can manage your own time you can
03:39 - prioritize tasks you can delegate when
03:41 - you need to and you can put your energy
03:43 - to the most productive and most
03:44 - efficient thing you can possibly be
03:46 - doing the worst case scenario is your
03:48 - manager has to constantly remind you of
03:50 - deadlines ask you when things are
03:52 - getting done you want to be proactive
03:54 - you want to be telling people how much
03:55 - time you need when something's going to
03:57 - be done and you want to be able to
03:58 - estimate that and manage it very very
04:00 - well so that you can be as efficient and
04:02 - productive as
04:04 - [Music]
04:06 - possible step number six business
04:09 - knowledge if you're someone who can take
04:11 - your engineering hat off and actually
04:12 - look at what you're doing from a
04:14 - business perspective whether that be
04:16 - marketing accounting profit raising
04:18 - money whatever the specific field is
04:21 - that's really going to set you apart
04:22 - because many developers can't do that
04:24 - and they only look at things purely from
04:26 - an engineering lens at the end of the
04:28 - day you're working for company what
04:30 - you're doing is helping the company
04:31 - achieve some type of goal typically at
04:33 - the end of the day that means driving
04:35 - revenue or driving profit and if you
04:37 - want to move up the ranks in the company
04:39 - and eventually be a manager director
04:42 - executive you're going to have to have
04:44 - that Baseline business knowledge I know
04:46 - for me what's really helped in a lot of
04:48 - things that I've done is that I have the
04:50 - business knowledge as well as the
04:51 - development knowledge and I can speak
04:53 - both languages I can talk about the
04:55 - engineering challenges while at the same
04:57 - time being able to talk to my CEO and
04:59 - and say hey this is how this is going to
05:01 - support the business objectives from
05:03 - what I've seen a lot of companies
05:04 - actually end up promoting the more kind
05:06 - of middle level Engineers the guys that
05:08 - aren't necessarily the best because they
05:10 - have more of that hybrid understanding
05:12 - they're good enough at engineering and
05:14 - good enough at business that you can
05:15 - actually bring them up to a higher level
05:17 - whereas some of the best software
05:19 - Engineers you want to just keep them as
05:21 - software Engineers you don't really want
05:22 - to move them into a management position
05:24 - or a more business oriented position
05:26 - because that's not where their skill set
05:28 - lies so it's really up to what you want
05:30 - to be doing but I've found in my life
05:32 - that business knowledge has really
05:33 - helped me quite a bit and it's allowed
05:35 - me to stand out as a developer in many
05:37 - different roles that I've been in now
05:39 - speaking of business knowledge I
05:40 - wouldn't be taking my own advice if I
05:41 - didn't share with you my new software
05:43 - development course the main goal of this
05:45 - course is to actually help you land a
05:47 - job that's how the course is designed
05:49 - from the very beginning and it's meant
05:51 - to do this as quickly as possible
05:53 - without leaving any gaps in your
05:54 - knowledge not only do we teach you all
05:56 - of the fundamental software development
05:58 - skills we allow you to pick a
06:00 - specialization in front-end devops or
06:02 - backend which is included in the price
06:04 - of the course this is taught by an
06:06 - industry expert and we give you career
06:08 - advice mentorship one-on-one support
06:10 - access to all of the instructors like
06:12 - myself literally everything we do is so
06:15 - that by the time you finish this program
06:17 - you are better qualified than all of the
06:19 - other Junior developers and you're going
06:21 - to stand out for any type of job you
06:22 - apply for I'm super pumped about this
06:24 - course we even have a free introduction
06:26 - course that tells you everything you
06:28 - need to do to break into s development
06:30 - you can sign up for that with no
06:31 - obligation from the link in the
06:33 - description I hope you guys like it with
06:35 - that said let's get into our last
06:37 - [Music]
06:39 - point the last Point here guys is soft
06:42 - skills this is a big Topic in the course
06:44 - as well but is so important because if
06:46 - you want to move up the ranks as a
06:48 - developer or just not get fired from
06:50 - your job you need to be a friendly
06:52 - person you need to know how to
06:53 - communicate you need to be confident
06:55 - speak clearly concisely and understand
06:58 - how you actually work with the team of
07:00 - people that's really what you're doing
07:02 - as a software developer you're working
07:04 - in a team very rarely are you working
07:06 - completely by yourself and communication
07:08 - is as important as the code that you
07:10 - write even if you're the best developer
07:12 - in the world if you can't communicate no
07:14 - one's going to want to work with you and
07:15 - I can say from experience even not being
07:18 - the best developer since I had strong
07:20 - communication skills I was always
07:22 - considered for raises and promotions
07:24 - versus some of the better developers
07:26 - simply because I was more well-rounded
07:28 - that's what you want to aim to be not
07:30 - just the absolute expert in one certain
07:32 - area but well-rounded so you have that
07:34 - business knowledge you have those
07:36 - communication skills you have those
07:37 - development skills if you have that
07:39 - you're going to stand out and you're
07:40 - going to be that top 1% developer
07:43 - anyways if you guys enjoyed this video

07:46 - the channel and I will see you in the
