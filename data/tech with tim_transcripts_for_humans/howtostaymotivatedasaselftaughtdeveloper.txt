00:03 - one thing that worked for me when I was
00:04 - learning how to code was creating an
00:06 - actual plan having an idea of the topics
00:08 - that I wanted to learn and then checking
00:10 - those topics off as I got through them I
00:12 - know this seems really basic but
00:14 - spending maybe one day or a few hours
00:16 - kind of creating a whole curriculum or
00:18 - list of topics that you want to go
00:19 - through and then every single day that
00:21 - you complete one checking it off that
00:23 - list seems trivial but when you go back
00:25 - to this two weeks three weeks four weeks
00:27 - later and you can see all of the things
00:29 - that you've accomplished it really
00:30 - allows you to conceptualize how much
00:32 - you're learning and how far you're
00:33 - actually moving in your journey beyond
00:35 - that make sure you give yourself
00:37 - reasonable time periods to take a break
00:39 - apply some of your knowledge and work on
00:41 - projects that maybe aren't on your
00:42 - roadmap maybe at week four you're gonna
00:44 - do some cool AI project week five you're
00:46 - gonna do a game that you always wanted
00:47 - to work on allow yourself to have these
00:49 - kind of mini breaks and mini
00:51 - celebrations where you can do things
00:52 - that maybe aren't the most productive
00:54 - that are helping you stay excited and
00:56 - passionate about programming
