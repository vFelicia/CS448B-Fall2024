00:00 - Welcome to our digital City just like
00:02 - any city is composed of different
00:04 - buildings each with its specific
00:06 - function a software application too can
00:08 - be composed of different parts instead
00:10 - of a monolithic structure where one
00:12 - component handles every task imagine
00:14 - dividing these tasks among smaller
00:16 - specialized components each of these
00:19 - tiny self-contained units is a
00:21 - microservice they handle one function do
00:24 - it well and communicate with others to
00:25 - create a complete software experience so
00:28 - how do we erect these specialized
00:30 - buildings well python with its versatile
00:32 - tools simplifies the process consider a
00:35 - building whose sole purpose is to greet
00:36 - newcomers using the flask framework in
00:39 - Python it might look something like this
00:41 - voila our greeter microservice Stands
00:43 - Tall and ready maybe we have another
00:46 - service that handles processing
00:47 - someone's documents and maybe one more
00:50 - for arranging leases and house rentals
00:52 - you can see that with microservices we
00:54 - create small simple and easy to
00:56 - understand components that work together
00:58 - to build an entire system this provides
01:01 - many different advantages now after
01:03 - we've made some microservices we
01:05 - typically use a server to deploy them
01:06 - now that's where the sponsor of this
01:08 - video occupy comes in occupies Cloud
01:11 - formerly called lenode cloud computing
01:13 - provides all of the cloud resources you
01:15 - need including high performance virtual
01:17 - private servers personally myself and my
01:20 - team use Akamai for everything from load
01:22 - balancers kubernetes clusters databases
01:25 - and storage volumes the best part is
01:27 - because I've been working with Akamai
01:28 - formed Lila node for over three years
01:30 - all of you can claim a free 100 credit
01:33 - by clicking the link in the description
01:35 - and signing up for a new account now as
01:38 - our city gains popularity it's as if
01:40 - flights from all over 1 to land here an
01:42 - airport efficiently directs planes to
01:44 - specific runways ensuring smooth
01:46 - operation and in our software context a
01:49 - load balancer acts just like this
01:51 - airport ensuring users requests are
01:53 - efficiently directed to the right
01:54 - microservice ensuring everyone gets
01:57 - timely service without overburdening a
01:59 - single component now we use a load
02:01 - balancer to direct traffic to different
02:02 - Services based on usage latency and a
02:05 - variety of other factors as we scale our
02:07 - system we create multiple instances of
02:09 - each microservice and a load balancer
02:11 - sits in front of them and manages the
02:13 - traffic across these instances but
02:15 - airports have challenges too what if a
02:18 - Runway undergoes repairs or a specific
02:19 - flight needs a specific gate similarly
02:22 - load balancers while efficient can face
02:25 - hiccups when Services change or require
02:27 - specific handling to handle the dynamic
02:30 - nature of our digital City we resort to
02:32 - Containers now in the software realm
02:34 - think of containers as specialized
02:36 - garages for our micro Services each
02:39 - garage or container ensures that the
02:41 - service it houses is uniform
02:43 - standardized and possesses all of the
02:45 - tools and configurations it needs to
02:47 - function optimally this isolation
02:49 - ensures our microservices run
02:51 - consistently regardless of where they're
02:53 - deployed but how do we craft these
02:55 - containers how do we ensure that each
02:57 - containerized service is built deployed
02:59 - and ran in a harmonized manner now
03:01 - that's where Docker comes in Docker is
03:04 - like the master architect and builder
03:06 - for these garages it provides the
03:08 - blueprint known as a Docker file to
03:10 - describe what goes into each container
03:12 - with Docker we create an image which is
03:14 - a template of our microservice complete
03:17 - with its dependencies libraries and
03:19 - configurations this image ensures that
03:22 - our service will run the same be it on a
03:24 - developer's laptop or a massive Cloud
03:26 - Server in essence Docker not only helps
03:28 - in creating these containerized services
03:30 - but ensures they are portable consistent
03:33 - and isolated making the development
03:34 - shipping and running of our
03:36 - microservices a truly seamless Affair if
03:39 - you want to learn more about Docker you
03:40 - can check out this video right here yet
03:43 - when we zoom out our city is just a part
03:45 - of a sprawling Metropolis at the
03:48 - Enterprise level scaling isn't just
03:50 - multiplying it's strategizing Services
03:52 - interconnect data consistency becomes
03:55 - Paramount and the city resilience is
03:57 - tested the true challenge lies in
03:59 - growing not just in size but in the
04:01 - efficiency and reliability of the
04:03 - different services that we have scaling
04:06 - our city involves making choices just as
04:08 - a city can grow upwards with taller
04:10 - skyscrapers or sprawl outwards covering
04:12 - more land our digital Metropolis can
04:14 - scale vertically or horizontally now
04:17 - vertical scaling often called scaling up
04:19 - is like adding more floors to an
04:21 - existing building in the digital world
04:23 - it means bolstering an existing system
04:25 - with more power be it Ram CPU storage
04:28 - gpus Etc it's a straightforward method
04:31 - but it has its ceiling there's a limit
04:33 - to how tall we can build or how much
04:35 - Hardware we can jam into one single
04:37 - machine on the other hand horizontal
04:39 - scaling or scaling out involves adding
04:42 - more buildings to our city each
04:44 - mirroring the other in our software City
04:46 - it means adding more instances of the
04:48 - same service to handle the increased
04:50 - load it's like creating a bridge between
04:52 - two parts of a city to distribute the
04:54 - traffic with horizontal scaling our city
04:56 - can expand almost indefinitely adapting
04:59 - to increased demands but it introduces
05:01 - complexities ensuring every service
05:03 - communicates efficiently data remains in
05:05 - consistent and the entire network
05:07 - functions as a cohesive unit so when our
05:10 - city grows from a local Hub to a
05:11 - sprawling Metropolis we're not just
05:13 - adding buildings we're strategizing
05:15 - ensuring traffic flows smoothly services
05:17 - are interconnected data is consistent
05:20 - and our digital dwellers enjoy
05:22 - uninterrupted Services it's an art and
05:24 - science of optimizing both size and
05:27 - efficiency our digital City's Journey
05:29 - from its micro services to its vast
05:31 - expanse mirrors the evolution of
05:33 - software and I hope that it helped you
05:34 - understand the basics of microservices
05:37 - if you want to learn more about scaling
05:39 - software and microservices make sure to

05:42 - I've linked below from our video sponsor
