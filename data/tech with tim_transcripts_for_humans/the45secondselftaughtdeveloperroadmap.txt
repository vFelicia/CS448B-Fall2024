00:00 - if you want to be a software engineer or
00:01 - developer well if so here's a list of
00:03 - things that you need to learn first of
00:05 - all programming fundamentals then object
00:08 - oriented programming then you need to
00:09 - move into advanced programming where you
00:11 - look at things like asynchronous
00:13 - programming threading and
00:14 - multi-processing then I'm going to learn
00:16 - about data structures and algorithms
00:18 - then you want to learn about the basics
00:19 - of databases continuing you might want
00:21 - to learn about how to use your IDE how
00:24 - to use tools like debuggers then you're
00:26 - going to want to get into git and GitHub
00:27 - and be familiar with those commands I'd
00:29 - also be learning A bash Linux and
00:32 - terminal commands then I'd move on to
00:34 - testing so end-to-end testing unit
00:35 - testing Etc and then lastly learning
00:38 - about some design principles and
00:40 - software engineering best practices
00:41 - obviously I left a few things out on
00:43 - this list if you want the full
00:44 - curriculum then check out my course
00:46 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
00:48 - the description
