00:00 - coding is changing quite a bit in 2024
00:02 - and here's what you need to know if you
00:04 - want to keep up first let's go through
00:06 - three facts coding is easier than ever
00:08 - to learn more people than ever know how
00:10 - to code and are learning how to code and
00:12 - AI tools like chat gbt have completely
00:14 - demolished the barrier to entry for
00:16 - building technical projects now here's
00:19 - what all of this means for you the fact
00:20 - that anyone can go online and really
00:22 - quickly figure out how to build anything
00:24 - they want with any language and any text
00:26 - stack means that basic coding skills are
00:29 - not enough we've seen that the
00:30 - requirements for junior Dev jobs are
00:32 - just getting steeper and steeper and now
00:34 - you pretty much need to be equivalent to
00:36 - a mid-level developer of two to three
00:38 - years ago to be able to land just a
00:39 - junior or internship level position what
00:42 - this really means is that if you want to
00:43 - be a great software engineer and you
00:45 - want to land a job you need to stand out
00:48 - and I'm going to tell you exactly how
00:49 - you can do that so first things first of
00:51 - course you've got to have the basics
00:53 - down you need to know fundamental
00:54 - programming skills you need to know
00:56 - tools like G and GitHub how to use an
00:58 - IDE how to do professional development
01:00 - and even things like data structures and
01:02 - algorithms are important you want to
01:04 - make sure that you're a well-rounded
01:05 - developer you've got all of these areas
01:07 - covered but that's just the starting
01:09 - point if you want to land a job now
01:11 - what's really important is that you
01:12 - specialize where people are still hiring
01:15 - developers and where I've specifically
01:16 - looked for developers I've needed to
01:18 - hire is people that have specialized
01:20 - knowledge that means they're really good
01:22 - in one area of development and they can
01:24 - do things a lot quicker than I'd be able
01:26 - to figure out using something like chat
01:28 - GPT specifically front end development
01:30 - backend development devops architecture
01:33 - system design if you're really good in
01:35 - one area of programming there's a
01:36 - language that you are a true expert in
01:39 - or a Frameworks that you know really
01:40 - really well you're going to stand out
01:42 - and those are a lot of the jobs that are
01:44 - popping up they want people that are
01:45 - really good at this really good at using
01:47 - this database really good with this
01:49 - framework or this language it's no
01:50 - longer enough to just be a generalist
01:53 - everyone can be a generalist using
01:54 - something like chat GPT you need to be
01:56 - the person that can audit chat GPT
01:59 - understand what it's going wrong and
02:00 - going right and how to use it the most
02:02 - effectively which ties into Point number
02:04 - two if you want to be a good developer
02:06 - and be able to land a job you need to be
02:08 - resourceful that means that like
02:10 - everyone else you need to know how to
02:12 - use these AI tools to become as
02:14 - productive as possible I know myself I
02:16 - almost always use chat GPT and AI coding
02:19 - tools that's become a part of my
02:20 - workflow and since I'm an experienced
02:22 - developer I can use them so much better
02:24 - and more effectively than many other
02:26 - beginners out there I know the questions
02:28 - to ask I know when it's me in the wrong
02:30 - direction I know how to prompt it to get
02:32 - the information I want and even though I
02:34 - could write the code myself I know how
02:36 - to direct it to do it in a faster way
02:39 - that's the big change with coding what's
02:41 - happening now is people are coding as if
02:43 - it's natural language what's really
02:45 - become important is how you explain how
02:47 - you articulate how you instruct
02:49 - something like an AI model and how you
02:51 - know when it's giving you the right
02:53 - answer and the wrong one no longer do
02:55 - you need to be an expert extremely fast
02:57 - level programmer writing all of the code
02:59 - you're yourself you need to be someone
03:00 - who knows what code needs to be written
03:03 - who can solve the problem at a high
03:04 - level and break it down into the
03:06 - discrete enough steps that it could be
03:08 - solved by an AI or assisted at least by
03:11 - some kind of artificial intelligence
03:13 - tool this is where I'm seeing the major
03:14 - change where moving away from coding
03:17 - being a pretty difficult thing where
03:18 - there's all this syntax and it's tough
03:20 - to learn to being something that can be
03:21 - implemented with natural language
03:23 - however understanding what language to
03:25 - give it is the hard part and that comes
03:28 - with experience now even if you've done
03:29 - all that and you've became a specialist
03:31 - and you know how to use all these types
03:32 - of tools you still need to be credible
03:35 - you need to show all of this knowledge
03:37 - to someone who's potentially going to be
03:39 - hiring you and that's a lot easier said
03:41 - than done so here's three simple ways
03:43 - that you can provide some credibility
03:45 - and things that you can put on your
03:46 - resume that will make you stand out and
03:48 - actually demonstrate your skills first
03:50 - this is an obvious one projects the best
03:52 - way to demonstrate you know how to do
03:54 - something is to actually have done it to
03:56 - have a project that's complex enough but
03:58 - also easy enough for someone to
04:00 - understand you can share on your resume
04:02 - you can talk about an interview and you
04:04 - can relate your experience back to
04:06 - beyond that having some kind of social
04:08 - media presence now in my case I'm
04:10 - instantly credible because of the
04:11 - hundreds if not thousands of videos at
04:13 - this point I have online the multiple
04:15 - courses that I've built the people that
04:17 - trust me in the Partnerships that I've
04:19 - built and this isn't something that
04:20 - everyone can do overnight but even when
04:22 - I had a really small YouTube channel
04:24 - just those 50 or 100 videos with minimal
04:26 - views demonstrated that I did actually
04:28 - know how to code you could go watch me
04:30 - do a coding live stream and see for a
04:32 - fact that I actually do know what I'm
04:34 - talking about and I'm able to build
04:35 - something out completely by myself this
04:37 - is what employers want to know that if
04:39 - you come on board you're not going to be
04:41 - someone they need to teach right from
04:42 - the beginning you already have that
04:44 - background you're confident working on
04:46 - your own and you just need a bit of
04:47 - mentorship and advice to get to that
04:49 - next level they're looking for people
04:50 - that can quickly accelerate up the ranks
04:53 - they want those god tier highlevel High
04:55 - productivity programmers and you need to
04:57 - demonstrate that you're already well on
04:59 - your your way to getting there lastly of
05:01 - course you can do this with experience
05:03 - if you've done an internship if you've
05:04 - done some volunteer work if you've done
05:06 - coding projects on the side maybe you've
05:08 - deployed some you built a website you've
05:10 - helped out in a Discord server or a
05:12 - community that can be great and in fact
05:13 - with my software development course
05:15 - we're giving students a ton of
05:17 - experience by actually hiring them to
05:18 - work for us after they complete the
05:20 - course if they're good enough obviously
05:22 - not everyone's going to get that
05:23 - position but we just hired two people
05:25 - graduating our software development
05:27 - course they really stood out they're
05:28 - great candidates based our final exam
05:30 - and now they're working as coaches
05:32 - they're doing grading and we're
05:33 - immediately trying to get them into our
05:35 - system because we know what potential
05:37 - they have to be a great developer if you
05:39 - guys want to check out my course you can

06:05 - make sure you actually know what you're
06:07 - talking about next join a community
06:09 - really important to network with other
06:11 - developers learn how to work in a team
06:13 - and get some inspiration and Insider
06:15 - Knowledge from other people that are
06:17 - going through the application process
06:18 - trying to land jobs gives you some
06:21 - motivation helps you out and gives you a
06:22 - lot of extra information you want a
06:24 - great Community there is one a part of
06:26 - the course careers software development
06:28 - course can check that out below I'm very

06:51 - are cleaned up that you come across as a
06:54 - professional when someone Googles your
06:56 - name ideally having a resume or
06:58 - portfolio website maybe having a little
07:00 - social media presence where you share
07:02 - some coding projects having a great
07:04 - GitHub where all the projects are
07:05 - organized clean easy to understand and

coding is changing quite a bit in 2024 and here's what you need to know if you want to keep up first let's go through three facts coding is easier than ever to learn more people than ever know how to
