00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so as
00:02 - you all know my name is Tim I'm a
00:03 - computer science major currently in my
00:05 - second year and I've just finished my
00:07 - third semester what I'm gonna be doing
00:09 - in this video is sharing with you my
00:11 - tips and strategies for doing well in
00:13 - computer science and surviving the harsh
00:15 - workload that comes with a major like
00:17 - computer science now this video is
00:19 - probably going to relate to people that
00:20 - are in engineering fields or science
00:22 - fields as well anything that shares a
00:23 - similar amount of workload to a major
00:26 - like computer science as they are you
00:28 - know fairly similar programs at least in
00:30 - the beginning years so before I get too
00:32 - far into this I'm gonna give you a very
00:33 - brief background on Who I am why I'm
00:35 - even qualified to be giving you this
00:36 - information so essentially my name is
00:38 - Tim as I've said I'm a computer science
00:40 - major I run this YouTube channel where I
00:42 - teach programming this is pretty much my
00:44 - full-time job I would say I probably
00:46 - commit five or six hours a day to
00:47 - working on this channel and to on my
00:49 - business and the rest of the time during
00:51 - my day I focus on school so after three
00:54 - semesters my current GPA I believe is in
00:56 - nine point four out of ten I'll put that
00:58 - up my unofficial transcript so you guys
01:00 - can get the exact figure but I'm pretty
01:02 - sure off the top of my head that's what
01:03 - it is and I think that is equivalent to
01:05 - a 4.0 on a 4.0 GPA scale so clearly I
01:09 - know how to spend my time I know how to
01:11 - get things done and that's why I'm gonna
01:12 - be sharing some tips with you guys here
01:14 - today so without further ado let's get
01:16 - into my first tip for surviving and
01:17 - doing well in computer science
01:19 - alright so my first and most important
01:21 - tip is to spend your time wisely and be
01:24 - very very careful the activities that
01:26 - you participate in that are wasting your
01:28 - time now
01:29 - let me kind of explain what I mean by
01:31 - this to break this down I hope all of
01:33 - you would agree with me is that if you
01:34 - had unlimited time you could get an A+
01:36 - in every single class you can do
01:37 - extremely well and you know everything
01:39 - will be fine you'd have enough time to
01:40 - do everything you need so the goal
01:42 - really here should be to maximize the
01:45 - amount of time you can spend doing
01:47 - things that you find for yourself
01:48 - productive right that you think was a
01:50 - good use of your time and the way that
01:53 - you can do this is to take one day your
01:55 - average school day maybe even a week
01:57 - actually and this might help and keep
01:59 - track of the activities you do in a day
02:01 - keep track of exactly what you get done
02:03 - and how long you spend doing different
02:05 - things now I'm telling you this because
02:06 - I know you guys are gonna realize when
02:08 - you look at that log afterwards how much
02:11 - time you're wasting and I'm not just
02:12 - talking about a few ow
02:13 - here and there I'm talking about entire
02:16 - day's worth of work just gone into the
02:19 - abyss just destroyed because they're
02:21 - spent doing things that you don't really
02:22 - care about that you're kind of just
02:23 - doing to waste time now obviously you
02:25 - have to have the mindset to do this you
02:27 - have to want to do better in school you
02:28 - have to want to get things done but if
02:30 - you have that mindset all you need to do
02:32 - is really just be careful in the ways in
02:34 - which you spend your time and stop doing
02:36 - activities that waste your time
02:38 - stop watching seven hours of TV every
02:41 - single day
02:41 - stop watching you know four hours of
02:43 - useless YouTube videos at night unless
02:45 - they're tech whatin programming YouTube
02:47 - videos right but that is kind of my
02:49 - point here you want to evaluate your
02:50 - time and be extremely careful in the
02:52 - activities that you participate in
02:54 - because if you don't find those
02:55 - meaningful activities you shouldn't be
02:57 - doing them now this obviously comes with
02:59 - a balance right and if you can do this
03:01 - and you can eliminate activities you
03:03 - don't care about you're gonna have more
03:04 - time to do things that you do care about
03:06 - and that's not even just school that
03:07 - could be working on a side project that
03:09 - could be hanging out with your friends
03:10 - maybe you go and play sports but if you
03:12 - can just eliminate the things that you
03:13 - don't care about from your life and
03:15 - those time wasting activities that
03:17 - really just eat up big chunks of your
03:18 - day you're gonna be much much better off
03:21 - I can tell you and I did this in first
03:22 - semester no joke absolutely no
03:24 - exaggeration I would say after a week of
03:26 - kind of employing this technique of
03:28 - really being careful with the way that I
03:30 - spend my time I was four or five times
03:32 - more productive since then from them and
03:35 - now I mean you guys can probably gauge
03:37 - how much I can actually do in a day that
03:39 - is simply because I don't waste time now
03:42 - I want to give you one very good example
03:43 - of how you can actually do this how you
03:45 - can stop wasting time now this is gonna
03:47 - sound like a very strange kind of
03:49 - request but I hope a lot of you would
03:51 - agree with me when I say most of our
03:54 - professors don't really teach very
03:56 - effectively they don't you know convey
03:58 - information well and what they teach in
04:00 - that hour-and-a-half lecture you can
04:01 - probably learn on your own in about 45
04:03 - minutes the first week of school every
04:06 - week what I do in my strategy is I go to
04:08 - class and rather than listen for all the
04:10 - course content I mean I do that a bit
04:12 - what I do is I evaluate my professor and
04:14 - I determine whether or not this person
04:17 - is an effective teacher so that I know
04:19 - whether I'm going to go to their class
04:21 - for the rest of the year or not and in
04:23 - that one day I make the decision whether
04:25 - I'm going or whether I'm not
04:26 - and honestly most of the time my
04:28 - decision is I'm not going to go and
04:30 - doing that has actually increased my
04:32 - grades a ton because what I've been able
04:34 - to do is now rather than spending
04:35 - probably two hours by the time I walked
04:37 - to class and walked back in a lecture
04:39 - hall with someone that can't teach me
04:41 - anything I learned on my own at my desk
04:43 - and it takes me 20 minutes and this has
04:45 - allowed me so much more time to just be
04:48 - able to study and get things done
04:50 - because I'm not having my time wasted by
04:52 - someone that can't teach me something
04:53 - effectively so something to think about
04:55 - again not really recommending this but
04:56 - just you know kind of keep it in the
04:58 - back of your head that is how I really
04:59 - employ this technique and it seems a bit
05:01 - drastic
05:02 - he seems like I should tell you to go to
05:03 - class but if you're not learning
05:04 - anything in class there's really no
05:06 - point alright so time for tip number two
05:08 - which is gonna be get organized now we
05:11 - just talked about time management for a
05:13 - long time I apologize that went on for
05:14 - longer than I expected but if you can
05:17 - now manage your time effectively and
05:19 - you've cut out the activities from your
05:21 - day that you shouldn't be doing or that
05:22 - you don't want to do that aren't
05:24 - considered productive to yourself what
05:26 - you can do now is really really get
05:28 - super efficient by getting organized now
05:31 - what I mean by that is really keeping
05:33 - track of everything so every assignment
05:35 - every every lecture every midterm
05:38 - everything you have you should have that
05:39 - written down you should have that
05:40 - storage somewhere personally for me I
05:42 - use a Google Calendar
05:43 - and what I do during syllabus week is I
05:45 - read through all my syllabuses and I add
05:47 - every single assignment every single lab
05:49 - every single lecture everything that I
05:50 - have in my calendar and the reason I do
05:53 - this is because this allows me to open
05:54 - up my calendar and at any point in time
05:56 - be able to tell you exactly what I kind
05:59 - of need to be working on and get done
06:00 - and not get lost and forget about
06:02 - activities another thing that I do is I
06:04 - have a whiteboard I you can't see it
06:05 - there over here and whenever I have an
06:07 - activity I need to do I immediately
06:09 - write it down on my whiteboard the
06:11 - reason I do this is because when I get
06:12 - back in my room after class or when I
06:14 - wake up in the morning it's right there
06:16 - in front of my face I see that activity
06:17 - and I can't forget about not doing that
06:20 - there's so many times where you tell
06:22 - yourself you know the night before I'm
06:23 - gonna get up and I'm gonna grind this
06:24 - I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do all this
06:25 - and then you get up and none of it
06:27 - happens for me I find it really helps to
06:29 - have a visual somewhere that you can see
06:31 - it somewhere that you can just pan your
06:33 - head from your desk to see all of the
06:35 - things that you need to do now some
06:36 - people might find this overwhelming I
06:37 - understand that but for me its moe
06:40 - evading to try to wipe those things off
06:41 - of the whiteboard and get them done so
06:43 - just make sure you're keeping track of
06:44 - everything you need to do and that you
06:46 - have all of those different things ready
06:48 - and you can at any point in time realize
06:50 - okay next week I'm gonna be really busy
06:51 - maybe I gotta do a little bit more more
06:53 - work right now so my third tip and this
06:55 - one is actually extremely important as
06:57 - well is to get things done early
06:59 - we're immediately when they're assigned
07:01 - to you now what I do personally is when
07:03 - I'm given an assignment or I'm given a
07:05 - lab or something like that I do it as
07:07 - soon as I possibly can as soon as that
07:09 - comes up on my brightspace which is my
07:11 - virtual campus where I have all this
07:12 - stuff I just do it and I get it out of
07:14 - the way and I get it done the reason I
07:16 - need to do this is because I have a lot
07:18 - of work I need to do for this YouTube
07:19 - channel and if I let schoolwork pile up
07:22 - there will be times where I will have to
07:24 - dedicate two or three days to finish all
07:26 - of that school work and to get that done
07:28 - and I don't have that luxury I need to
07:30 - be able to do this so for me the way
07:32 - that I you know kind of combat that is
07:34 - by when I get something I do it
07:35 - immediately I never let things stack and
07:38 - I never let things pile up and that also
07:39 - allows me to live very stress-free
07:42 - there's never a point in time where I
07:44 - wake up and my assignments due at
07:46 - midnight and I haven't finished it yet
07:47 - and that is a whole new lifestyle that
07:50 - I'm sure a lot of you probably have
07:51 - never experienced before but it really
07:53 - makes things a lot easier on yourself
07:55 - getting things done early you know
07:57 - you're incrementally kind of doing work
07:59 - throughout the semester and you're not
08:00 - just waiting for weekends where you just
08:02 - grind and just spend 18 hours doing
08:05 - homework assignments and you're just
08:06 - stressed and you don't know if you're
08:07 - gonna get something done and you end up
08:08 - getting a poor grade on it it's just
08:10 - this really lets you relax by doing this
08:13 - immediately when you get it yes you know
08:15 - it's a pain maybe you don't have time
08:16 - the day to get it done but as soon as
08:18 - you possibly can get an assignment done
08:20 - as soon as it's assigned that's the best
08:22 - time to do it because you're never
08:23 - piling up and you're allowed to kind of
08:25 - live stressful eat free and relax and
08:27 - for me you know if I want to take a day
08:29 - off I want to lie down for 20 minutes
08:30 - I'm allowed to do that because
08:32 - everything I need to do has been done I
08:34 - haven't let it and they pile up and I
08:35 - only have a little bit of work that
08:37 - needs to come so that's a really big tip
08:38 - I know a lot of you guys aren't going to
08:40 - do this but just trust me when I tell
08:41 - you this makes your life so much easier
08:43 - so much less stressful and allows you to
08:46 - take a break to relax because obviously
08:47 - everyone needs that they need that
08:49 - balance okay so my tip number 4 and
08:51 - again this one is just this makes
08:53 - big difference when it comes to actually
08:55 - getting a better grade and doing better
08:57 - in the program in general is do well
08:59 - extremely well in everything before the
09:03 - midterm and the final
09:04 - so we not first kind of I want to say
09:06 - third of the semester you should do
09:08 - extremely well now the reason I'm saying
09:10 - this is because this is the easiest time
09:13 - to do well the only things you're
09:14 - probably going to have in a computer
09:16 - science or engineering degree is gonna
09:18 - be quizzes which are like you study a
09:20 - day or two before the thing and you
09:21 - should be able to do well on those
09:22 - assignments which are take-home there's
09:24 - absolutely no excuse to not do well on
09:26 - assignments and labs which are usually
09:28 - just free marks anyways if you can do
09:31 - well on these sections you can secure
09:33 - yourself you know usually a good chunk
09:34 - of your grade before you get to the
09:36 - midterm or the final and for me I know
09:38 - most of my classes there's about a 20%
09:40 - chunk of the grade that comes from all
09:42 - that stuff that's not the midterm or the
09:43 - final doing well on this helps you a ton
09:46 - but I don't understand why people you
09:49 - know take this for granted and don't do
09:50 - well on it I see so many people that
09:52 - just you know bomb the assignments or
09:54 - you know the Obama midterm and they just
09:56 - say oh it doesn't matter because my
09:58 - final will override my mark and what I'm
10:00 - saying by that is there's a lot of
10:01 - programs I think my program most of the
10:04 - classes are like this if you do better
10:05 - on your final exam than your current
10:07 - grade your current grade just becomes
10:09 - your final exam or at least like it'll
10:11 - override the midterm there's some
10:12 - formulas for that but why would you ever
10:15 - want to do this to yourself why do you
10:17 - want to put you know your entire grade
10:19 - so you say you have a 40 and you're like
10:21 - oh it's fine I'll just do well on the
10:22 - exam on this one exam that's now gonna
10:24 - be pretty much 95% of your mark this is
10:27 - the hardest thing to do well on it's the
10:29 - most amount of content it's during the
10:31 - most stressful time of the year and
10:32 - you're saying it's fine I don't need to
10:34 - do anything in the easy point in the
10:35 - year because when it comes to the really
10:37 - hard part of the year and I have five
10:38 - classes that I need to do this for I'll
10:40 - be fine
10:40 - it just doesn't really make any sense if
10:42 - you can do really well in the beginning
10:44 - the semester do really well on the
10:45 - midterm you're not gonna be that stress
10:47 - going into the exam because all you need
10:49 - is a 40% to pass the class and you know
10:52 - you can just have a better grade in
10:54 - general a lot of times for me you know I
10:55 - don't really study that hard for my
10:56 - exams I'll get like a seventy on the
10:58 - exam but because I have a hundred in the
11:00 - rest of the class I'll finish with a
11:01 - ninety right and that's kind of what you
11:03 - want to do that's what you want to allow
11:04 - yourself to get just
11:06 - well in the beginning in the year get
11:07 - all that easy stuff out of the way go to
11:09 - all the labs do all these you know what
11:11 - tedious things that are gonna build your
11:12 - grade up and then during the exam you
11:14 - know try your best study wealth but if
11:16 - you don't it's not a big deal and you
11:17 - don't need to stress about it
11:18 - so my last and final tip this one's not
11:21 - crazy important but it definitely makes
11:23 - a difference is to make friends and use
11:25 - the resources available to you now a lot
11:28 - of people go through school and they
11:29 - just go and they do it solo and they say
11:32 - you know it's me I got this I don't need
11:33 - help I don't need to go to the guidance
11:35 - office I don't need friends I don't need
11:36 - and they just go and they just grind you
11:38 - know usually they end up doing okay but
11:39 - I can tell you being someone that's
11:41 - capable of doing that it's way easier if
11:43 - you just have a few friends and you work
11:45 - with them and get some stuff from them
11:46 - the amount of times that I feel okay
11:49 - just skipping a class because I know one
11:50 - of my friends will send me the notes or
11:52 - he'll let me know if something is
11:53 - important is crazy that's a really
11:55 - massive advantage that you want to give
11:56 - yourself and everyone really like wants
11:59 - to be your friend a lot of people in
12:01 - these programs are fairly nice you know
12:03 - they're in the same boat as you there's
12:04 - Facebook group chats there's so many
12:06 - resources and you don't need to do
12:08 - everything on your own you know work in
12:10 - a team make some friends like team up
12:12 - with people in your computer science
12:14 - classes get to know them and use each
12:16 - other you know they'll probably ask you
12:17 - for help and then you can ask them for
12:19 - help back so use your resources use
12:20 - everything available and be smart and
12:23 - that's kind of the whole point of this
12:24 - video it's just be smart about the way
12:26 - in which you're doing things I will
12:28 - never tell you to grind and work as hard
12:30 - as you possibly can for school and do
12:32 - all that that's not at all what I want
12:34 - to say to you guys what I want to say is
12:35 - just be smart you know make a good
12:37 - decision when it comes to what you're
12:39 - doing get things done early manage your
12:41 - time well stay organized these things
12:43 - aren't that hard to do and they're gonna
12:45 - bring you from genuinely like a 70
12:47 - percent to an 85 or a 90 and that's
12:49 - exactly what they did for me when I
12:51 - really start employing this techniques
12:52 - into my daily schedule so anyways that
12:56 - has kind of been this video I'd love to
12:58 - hear from you guys what you thought of
12:59 - these tips do you agree do you disagree
13:01 - obviously this isn't gonna work for
13:03 - everyone and this is my kind of you know
13:05 - standpoint and viewpoint of the things
13:07 - that work well but I figured I would
13:08 - share it with you guys because I know a
13:09 - lot of you are in computer science and
13:11 - you can benefit so leave a comment
13:12 - before you go with your best tip for
13:14 - computer science majors or for students
13:16 - the way that you study in the way that
13:18 - people can you know
13:19 - get better and with that being said I
13:20 - hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
13:22 - did leave a like subscribe to the
13:24 - channel and I will see you in another
13:25 - one

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so as you all know my name is Tim I'm a computer science major currently in my second year and I've just finished my third semester what I'm gonna be doing in this video is sharing with you my tips and strategies for doing well in computer science and surviving the harsh workload that comes with a major like computer science now this video is probably going to relate to people that are in engineering fields or science fields as well anything that shares a similar amount of workload to a major like computer science as they are you know fairly similar programs at least in the beginning years so before I get too far into this I'm gonna give you a very brief background on Who I am why I'm even qualified to be giving you this information so essentially my name is Tim as I've said I'm a computer science major I run this YouTube channel where I teach programming this is pretty much my fulltime job I would say I probably commit five or six hours a day to working on this channel and to on my business and the rest of the time during my day I focus on school so after three semesters my current GPA I believe is in nine point four out of ten I'll put that up my unofficial transcript so you guys can get the exact figure but I'm pretty sure off the top of my head that's what it is and I think that is equivalent to a 4.0 on a 4.0 GPA scale so clearly I know how to spend my time I know how to get things done and that's why I'm gonna be sharing some tips with you guys here today so without further ado let's get into my first tip for surviving and doing well in computer science alright so my first and most important tip is to spend your time wisely and be very very careful the activities that you participate in that are wasting your time now let me kind of explain what I mean by this to break this down I hope all of you would agree with me is that if you had unlimited time you could get an A+ in every single class you can do extremely well and you know everything will be fine you'd have enough time to do everything you need so the goal really here should be to maximize the amount of time you can spend doing things that you find for yourself productive right that you think was a good use of your time and the way that you can do this is to take one day your average school day maybe even a week actually and this might help and keep track of the activities you do in a day keep track of exactly what you get done and how long you spend doing different things now I'm telling you this because I know you guys are gonna realize when you look at that log afterwards how much time you're wasting and I'm not just talking about a few ow here and there I'm talking about entire day's worth of work just gone into the abyss just destroyed because they're spent doing things that you don't really care about that you're kind of just doing to waste time now obviously you have to have the mindset to do this you have to want to do better in school you have to want to get things done but if you have that mindset all you need to do is really just be careful in the ways in which you spend your time and stop doing activities that waste your time stop watching seven hours of TV every single day stop watching you know four hours of useless YouTube videos at night unless they're tech whatin programming YouTube videos right but that is kind of my point here you want to evaluate your time and be extremely careful in the activities that you participate in because if you don't find those meaningful activities you shouldn't be doing them now this obviously comes with a balance right and if you can do this and you can eliminate activities you don't care about you're gonna have more time to do things that you do care about and that's not even just school that could be working on a side project that could be hanging out with your friends maybe you go and play sports but if you can just eliminate the things that you don't care about from your life and those time wasting activities that really just eat up big chunks of your day you're gonna be much much better off I can tell you and I did this in first semester no joke absolutely no exaggeration I would say after a week of kind of employing this technique of really being careful with the way that I spend my time I was four or five times more productive since then from them and now I mean you guys can probably gauge how much I can actually do in a day that is simply because I don't waste time now I want to give you one very good example of how you can actually do this how you can stop wasting time now this is gonna sound like a very strange kind of request but I hope a lot of you would agree with me when I say most of our professors don't really teach very effectively they don't you know convey information well and what they teach in that hourandahalf lecture you can probably learn on your own in about 45 minutes the first week of school every week what I do in my strategy is I go to class and rather than listen for all the course content I mean I do that a bit what I do is I evaluate my professor and I determine whether or not this person is an effective teacher so that I know whether I'm going to go to their class for the rest of the year or not and in that one day I make the decision whether I'm going or whether I'm not and honestly most of the time my decision is I'm not going to go and doing that has actually increased my grades a ton because what I've been able to do is now rather than spending probably two hours by the time I walked to class and walked back in a lecture hall with someone that can't teach me anything I learned on my own at my desk and it takes me 20 minutes and this has allowed me so much more time to just be able to study and get things done because I'm not having my time wasted by someone that can't teach me something effectively so something to think about again not really recommending this but just you know kind of keep it in the back of your head that is how I really employ this technique and it seems a bit drastic he seems like I should tell you to go to class but if you're not learning anything in class there's really no point alright so time for tip number two which is gonna be get organized now we just talked about time management for a long time I apologize that went on for longer than I expected but if you can now manage your time effectively and you've cut out the activities from your day that you shouldn't be doing or that you don't want to do that aren't considered productive to yourself what you can do now is really really get super efficient by getting organized now what I mean by that is really keeping track of everything so every assignment every every lecture every midterm everything you have you should have that written down you should have that storage somewhere personally for me I use a Google Calendar and what I do during syllabus week is I read through all my syllabuses and I add every single assignment every single lab every single lecture everything that I have in my calendar and the reason I do this is because this allows me to open up my calendar and at any point in time be able to tell you exactly what I kind of need to be working on and get done and not get lost and forget about activities another thing that I do is I have a whiteboard I you can't see it there over here and whenever I have an activity I need to do I immediately write it down on my whiteboard the reason I do this is because when I get back in my room after class or when I wake up in the morning it's right there in front of my face I see that activity and I can't forget about not doing that there's so many times where you tell yourself you know the night before I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna grind this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do all this and then you get up and none of it happens for me I find it really helps to have a visual somewhere that you can see it somewhere that you can just pan your head from your desk to see all of the things that you need to do now some people might find this overwhelming I understand that but for me its moe evading to try to wipe those things off of the whiteboard and get them done so just make sure you're keeping track of everything you need to do and that you have all of those different things ready and you can at any point in time realize okay next week I'm gonna be really busy maybe I gotta do a little bit more more work right now so my third tip and this one is actually extremely important as well is to get things done early we're immediately when they're assigned to you now what I do personally is when I'm given an assignment or I'm given a lab or something like that I do it as soon as I possibly can as soon as that comes up on my brightspace which is my virtual campus where I have all this stuff I just do it and I get it out of the way and I get it done the reason I need to do this is because I have a lot of work I need to do for this YouTube channel and if I let schoolwork pile up there will be times where I will have to dedicate two or three days to finish all of that school work and to get that done and I don't have that luxury I need to be able to do this so for me the way that I you know kind of combat that is by when I get something I do it immediately I never let things stack and I never let things pile up and that also allows me to live very stressfree there's never a point in time where I wake up and my assignments due at midnight and I haven't finished it yet and that is a whole new lifestyle that I'm sure a lot of you probably have never experienced before but it really makes things a lot easier on yourself getting things done early you know you're incrementally kind of doing work throughout the semester and you're not just waiting for weekends where you just grind and just spend 18 hours doing homework assignments and you're just stressed and you don't know if you're gonna get something done and you end up getting a poor grade on it it's just this really lets you relax by doing this immediately when you get it yes you know it's a pain maybe you don't have time the day to get it done but as soon as you possibly can get an assignment done as soon as it's assigned that's the best time to do it because you're never piling up and you're allowed to kind of live stressful eat free and relax and for me you know if I want to take a day off I want to lie down for 20 minutes I'm allowed to do that because everything I need to do has been done I haven't let it and they pile up and I only have a little bit of work that needs to come so that's a really big tip I know a lot of you guys aren't going to do this but just trust me when I tell you this makes your life so much easier so much less stressful and allows you to take a break to relax because obviously everyone needs that they need that balance okay so my tip number 4 and again this one is just this makes big difference when it comes to actually getting a better grade and doing better in the program in general is do well extremely well in everything before the midterm and the final so we not first kind of I want to say third of the semester you should do extremely well now the reason I'm saying this is because this is the easiest time to do well the only things you're probably going to have in a computer science or engineering degree is gonna be quizzes which are like you study a day or two before the thing and you should be able to do well on those assignments which are takehome there's absolutely no excuse to not do well on assignments and labs which are usually just free marks anyways if you can do well on these sections you can secure yourself you know usually a good chunk of your grade before you get to the midterm or the final and for me I know most of my classes there's about a 20% chunk of the grade that comes from all that stuff that's not the midterm or the final doing well on this helps you a ton but I don't understand why people you know take this for granted and don't do well on it I see so many people that just you know bomb the assignments or you know the Obama midterm and they just say oh it doesn't matter because my final will override my mark and what I'm saying by that is there's a lot of programs I think my program most of the classes are like this if you do better on your final exam than your current grade your current grade just becomes your final exam or at least like it'll override the midterm there's some formulas for that but why would you ever want to do this to yourself why do you want to put you know your entire grade so you say you have a 40 and you're like oh it's fine I'll just do well on the exam on this one exam that's now gonna be pretty much 95% of your mark this is the hardest thing to do well on it's the most amount of content it's during the most stressful time of the year and you're saying it's fine I don't need to do anything in the easy point in the year because when it comes to the really hard part of the year and I have five classes that I need to do this for I'll be fine it just doesn't really make any sense if you can do really well in the beginning the semester do really well on the midterm you're not gonna be that stress going into the exam because all you need is a 40% to pass the class and you know you can just have a better grade in general a lot of times for me you know I don't really study that hard for my exams I'll get like a seventy on the exam but because I have a hundred in the rest of the class I'll finish with a ninety right and that's kind of what you want to do that's what you want to allow yourself to get just well in the beginning in the year get all that easy stuff out of the way go to all the labs do all these you know what tedious things that are gonna build your grade up and then during the exam you know try your best study wealth but if you don't it's not a big deal and you don't need to stress about it so my last and final tip this one's not crazy important but it definitely makes a difference is to make friends and use the resources available to you now a lot of people go through school and they just go and they do it solo and they say you know it's me I got this I don't need help I don't need to go to the guidance office I don't need friends I don't need and they just go and they just grind you know usually they end up doing okay but I can tell you being someone that's capable of doing that it's way easier if you just have a few friends and you work with them and get some stuff from them the amount of times that I feel okay just skipping a class because I know one of my friends will send me the notes or he'll let me know if something is important is crazy that's a really massive advantage that you want to give yourself and everyone really like wants to be your friend a lot of people in these programs are fairly nice you know they're in the same boat as you there's Facebook group chats there's so many resources and you don't need to do everything on your own you know work in a team make some friends like team up with people in your computer science classes get to know them and use each other you know they'll probably ask you for help and then you can ask them for help back so use your resources use everything available and be smart and that's kind of the whole point of this video it's just be smart about the way in which you're doing things I will never tell you to grind and work as hard as you possibly can for school and do all that that's not at all what I want to say to you guys what I want to say is just be smart you know make a good decision when it comes to what you're doing get things done early manage your time well stay organized these things aren't that hard to do and they're gonna bring you from genuinely like a 70 percent to an 85 or a 90 and that's exactly what they did for me when I really start employing this techniques into my daily schedule so anyways that has kind of been this video I'd love to hear from you guys what you thought of these tips do you agree do you disagree obviously this isn't gonna work for everyone and this is my kind of you know standpoint and viewpoint of the things that work well but I figured I would share it with you guys because I know a lot of you are in computer science and you can benefit so leave a comment before you go with your best tip for computer science majors or for students the way that you study in the way that people can you know get better and with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in another one
