00:00 - let me explain to you the concept of
00:01 - asynchronous programming in under 60
00:03 - seconds so let's imagine we're a chef in
00:05 - a kitchen we're only one person and that
00:07 - means we can only really do one thing at
00:09 - a time let's say we're preparing some
00:10 - dish and we have three steps or three
00:12 - things that we need to make as a part of
00:14 - that dish if we were doing this
00:15 - synchronously then we'd have to wait for
00:17 - each individual component of the dish to
00:19 - be finished before we moved on to the
00:21 - next one so that means if it took 20
00:22 - minutes to cook our chicken we'd wait
00:24 - that full 20 minutes cook the chicken
00:25 - and then move on to the next step now
00:27 - this is different than asynchronous
00:29 - programming in asynchronous programming
00:30 - we can only be working on one thing at a
00:32 - time but we can pause working on
00:34 - something while we wait and move on to a
00:37 - separate task so while the chicken is in
00:38 - the oven we can start preparing the
00:40 - sauce or cooking the vegetables we're
00:41 - working on the next steps well we don't
00:43 - need to be doing any work on the chicken
00:45 - this is the general concept behind
00:47 - asynchronous programming you can
00:48 - implement this in pretty much any
00:50 - programming language and the idea is
00:51 - you're only doing one thing at a time
00:53 - but you're switching between the
00:55 - different tasks not waiting for one
00:57 - thing to completely finish before you
00:59 - move on to the next one
