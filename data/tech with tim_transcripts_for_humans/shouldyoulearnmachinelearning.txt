00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:12 - discussing if i think that you
00:14 - should learn machine learning and the
00:16 - reason i'm making this video is because
00:18 - recently there has been a ton of hype
00:20 - related to machine learning and ai
00:22 - and it seems like everybody wants to
00:23 - dive into this field regardless of their
00:25 - background
00:26 - and even beginner programmers are
00:28 - constantly asking me should i get into
00:30 - machine learning where should i get
00:31 - started i want to build ai
00:33 - so on and so forth so in this video what
00:35 - i'll do is share some advantages and
00:37 - disadvantages kind of pros and cons
00:39 - of getting into machine learning and
00:41 - hopefully help answer the question if
00:43 - machine learning is right for you
00:44 - and if you should start on the path of
00:46 - kind of getting into ai and
00:47 - ml regardless if you're someone who
00:50 - knows that you want to get into machine
00:51 - learning
00:52 - there is an awesome platform i need to
00:54 - share with you which is called machine
00:56 - learning expert which happens to be the
00:57 - sponsor of this video
00:59 - before we get started i need to thank
01:01 - algo expert for sponsoring this video
01:03 - and having me talk to you about their
01:04 - awesome new product machine learning
01:06 - expert ml expert is a revolutionary
01:09 - platform to learn machine learning and
01:10 - prepare for your machine learning
01:12 - interviews
01:12 - as an awesome ml crash course that
01:14 - teaches you supervised learning
01:16 - unsupervised learning deep learning and
01:18 - much more once you've mastered the
01:20 - basics you can move on to learn about
01:21 - large-scale machine learning
01:23 - and see how to design and build complex
01:25 - machine learning systems that scale
01:27 - finally to practice your skills and
01:29 - prepare for your interviews you can
01:30 - check out the machine learning coding
01:32 - questions
01:33 - ml quiz and ml design questions this
01:36 - whole course is taught by ryan
01:37 - an ex-amazon machine learning
01:39 - infrastructure engineer that is a true
01:41 - machine learning expert
01:42 - check out ml expert today from the link
01:44 - in the description and use the code tech
01:46 - with tim for a discount on the platform
01:48 - all right so let's go ahead and dive
01:49 - into the video here the first thing i'm
01:51 - going to do is just share with you a
01:52 - very interesting story that was actually
01:54 - told to me
01:55 - by my marketing professor i took a
01:57 - marketing class probably about a year
01:58 - ago
01:59 - and it relates to machine learning and
02:00 - how machine learning is used
02:02 - for marketing efforts for large retail
02:04 - chains like walmart costco
02:06 - so on and so forth so if you don't want
02:08 - to hear that story feel free to fast
02:09 - forward i'll put some kind of timestamps
02:10 - in the description but i found it really
02:12 - interesting
02:13 - interesting enough that i'm going to
02:14 - share it with you here so i'm going to
02:15 - start by sharing a little bit of context
02:16 - here as it relates to retail stores
02:18 - and their use of machine learning so
02:20 - retail stores have been using machine
02:22 - learning
02:22 - for a very long time even probably
02:24 - before social media although i would
02:26 - assume it'd be a lot less advanced than
02:27 - it is now but they've been using it for
02:29 - a long time to optimize things like
02:31 - what products you should have on what
02:32 - shelves where you should lay out stores
02:34 - how to optimize
02:35 - foot traffic in the store how many staff
02:37 - you should have each day based on the
02:38 - volume of transactions
02:40 - what time of year you want to have
02:41 - certain products in store right they've
02:43 - been doing that
02:44 - all the time and that's one of the
02:45 - reasons why they're very successful
02:47 - is they have mass amounts of data and
02:49 - information and they run them through
02:50 - these advanced machine learning models
02:52 - that are able to actually help them
02:54 - increase revenue profits uh decrease
02:56 - costs so on and so forth
02:57 - one of the main things that retail
02:59 - chains like this use machine learning
03:01 - for
03:01 - is marketing right they want to be able
03:03 - to target you with specific ad campaigns
03:05 - and they want to entice you to come in
03:06 - and buy stuff that is really the end
03:08 - end goal of machine learning make money
03:10 - right in a lot of cases
03:12 - so anyways this story here kind of
03:14 - starts with this woman who goes into
03:16 - costco or walmart one of these very
03:18 - large retail chains and she's using a
03:20 - rewards card now whenever you use a
03:22 - rewards card to use the same credit card
03:24 - constantly or you give an email or
03:26 - something to a store
03:27 - they start building a profile on you and
03:29 - keeping track of
03:30 - everything that that you buy they know
03:32 - when you bought it what time you bought
03:33 - it how much you spent your average
03:34 - purchase price
03:35 - they know all of these things and
03:37 - they're able to build a pretty detailed
03:39 - profile on you
03:40 - and start making pretty accurate guesses
03:42 - on when you're going to come in next
03:43 - what you're buying frequently what they
03:45 - should try to encourage you to buy
03:46 - and then from that profile they will
03:48 - specifically target ads towards you
03:50 - by sending you know coupons to you or
03:52 - sending emails with discounts
03:54 - whatever right they'll target you with
03:56 - ads based on what is that you've bought
03:58 - so the story kind of goes like this this
04:00 - young woman is going into this walmart
04:02 - this costco as i was saying she's using
04:03 - a rewards card and so they're able to
04:05 - build this profile on her
04:07 - on what she's purchasing and what she's
04:09 - purchasing is a lot of stuff related to
04:10 - pregnancy they're
04:11 - kind of an expecting mother what you
04:12 - might buy if you're expecting to have a
04:14 - baby right
04:15 - and so she's buying all of this stuff
04:17 - and i guess the machine learning model
04:18 - that's sending out these coupons
04:20 - kind of realizes that this picks it up
04:22 - and all of a sudden sends a coupon
04:23 - booklet to her address where she's still
04:25 - living with her parents
04:26 - and all of these coupons are related to
04:28 - stuff that she's been purchasing right
04:29 - trying to entice her to come back and
04:31 - buy more
04:32 - giving her coupons for you know diapers
04:33 - pregnancy related items
04:35 - and so the dad takes this coupon box
04:37 - from the mail and starts
04:38 - reading through it and realizes that
04:40 - everything here is related to
04:42 - pregnancy pretty much right and so he is
04:44 - extremely upset
04:45 - super pissed he thinks that this walmart
04:47 - this costco is trying to entice his
04:49 - daughter
04:49 - to go and get pregnant or do whatever it
04:52 - is that he thinks they're doing
04:53 - and so he sends all these nasty emails
04:55 - calls up the manager blah blah blah and
04:56 - is all upset about it
04:57 - but then goes and talks to his daughter
04:59 - and realizes that his daughter
05:00 - actually is pregnant and then kind of
05:02 - has to go back on the email and say
05:04 - sorry we had a long discussion blah blah
05:06 - but i just thought that was an
05:06 - interesting story because that kind of
05:08 - shows you the power of machine learning
05:10 - this machine learning model was able to
05:12 - identify that this woman was pregnant
05:15 - before her own father now obviously this
05:17 - is probably a rare case or a strange
05:18 - situation
05:19 - but it just kind of emphasized to me the
05:21 - power of machine learning
05:23 - and how it actually is used so heavily
05:25 - in our daily lives that we may not
05:27 - realize
05:27 - and well that's kind of how i'm going to
05:29 - segue into this video here
05:30 - and start talking about some of the pros
05:32 - and cons of learning this so hopefully
05:34 - you guys enjoyed that story but now i'm
05:35 - going to get into the pros
05:37 - one of the first pros that i have to
05:39 - share with you here is that
05:40 - learning machine learning and
05:42 - understanding how it works and
05:43 - specifically its use cases and
05:44 - applications
05:45 - allows you to better understand how you
05:48 - are being influenced
05:49 - by machine learning models in your
05:51 - everyday life because machine learning
05:53 - really is everywhere it's actually kind
05:55 - of scary how much stuff is using machine
05:57 - learning
05:57 - and how much data companies and just the
05:59 - internet in general has on you
06:01 - and by having some kind of insight and
06:03 - background in this field
06:04 - hopefully that allows you to act a
06:06 - little bit more independently and
06:07 - realize the conscious and subconscious
06:09 - effects
06:10 - of all of these recommendations and
06:11 - machine learning models that really are
06:13 - impacting you on a day-to-day life
06:15 - so that is pro number one so the second
06:17 - pro i have for you here is that
06:19 - understanding machine
06:20 - learning even on a very basic
06:21 - rudimentary level allows you to take
06:24 - any data that you may have even if it's
06:26 - not mass amounts of data even if it's
06:28 - not business related data even if it's
06:29 - something
06:30 - super personal like your average
06:32 - calendar or schedule
06:33 - or daily routines whatever it may be you
06:35 - can take this data now
06:37 - run it through a machine learning model
06:39 - and actually find very very interesting
06:41 - patterns and information that you would
06:42 - never be able to see by simply analyzing
06:45 - this
06:45 - as a human humans just are not good at
06:47 - picking out patterns in data
06:49 - especially large volumes of data and
06:51 - machine learning models can expose
06:53 - very very interesting things even
06:55 - something super simple
06:56 - like putting in all of your grades into
06:58 - a calculator right or into a machine
07:00 - learning model story and trying to
07:01 - predict what average you're going to end
07:03 - up with next semester
07:04 - now of course there's a lot of other
07:05 - factors than your previous grades that
07:07 - are going to determine that but just
07:08 - really cool to take any data that you
07:10 - have
07:10 - and understand how you can turn this
07:12 - data which is relatively meaningless
07:14 - into actual information and there's a
07:17 - lot of quotes related to data and
07:18 - information
07:19 - but data is said to be pretty worthless
07:21 - unless you can turn it into some
07:23 - knowledge some information
07:24 - that you can actually utilize right and
07:26 - i know for myself someone that has a ton
07:28 - of data accessible to myself whether it
07:30 - be through my youtube channel whether it
07:31 - be through my discord server or my other
07:33 - social medias
07:34 - being able to actually analyze this data
07:36 - look at patterns
07:37 - run through models look at predictions
07:39 - and just see correlations between
07:41 - different things
07:42 - is really really helpful when it comes
07:44 - to determining you know what videos i'm
07:45 - going to make next
07:46 - how i'm going to increase revenue of my
07:48 - youtube channel what videos on the
07:49 - channel seem to attract more clicks so
07:51 - on and so forth
07:52 - i'm just trying to kind of open you up
07:54 - to the idea of if you have some data
07:57 - and you understand machine learning you
07:59 - can find some very very interesting
08:00 - piece of information
08:01 - from this so that's kind of point number
08:03 - two hard to elaborate too much more give
08:05 - you any great examples because i don't
08:06 - know your own use cases but if you're
08:08 - someone who runs a small business
08:10 - or just has any data in front of you
08:12 - learning machine learning is definitely
08:13 - going to be very valuable
08:14 - and you're going to see some pretty
08:16 - interesting patterns and information
08:17 - likely from this data that you do have
08:20 - so now the third pro i have for you when
08:21 - it comes to learning machine learning is
08:23 - that you get to be a part of a
08:24 - constantly evolving field
08:26 - that is genuinely changing the way in
08:28 - which humans live
08:29 - you know either in a good or bad way you
08:31 - can make that argument for yourself
08:33 - and you can now understand
08:35 - state-of-the-art research that's going
08:36 - on in these fields and actually
08:38 - be a part of this in some sense now some
08:40 - of you may argue that because you know
08:42 - you're not very good at machine learning
08:43 - or you're just getting started
08:44 - you're not really a part of this you
08:46 - know constantly evolving and very
08:47 - exciting field
08:48 - but i would beg to differ because even
08:50 - just having that basic understanding
08:52 - as i was saying allows you to really
08:54 - appreciate what is being created
08:56 - by the absolute geniuses out there you
08:58 - know even something like tesla
08:59 - self-driving
09:00 - uh you know chess ais like stock fish or
09:02 - alpha zero
09:03 - all of these really cool things that are
09:05 - coming out it just gives you an
09:06 - appreciation for them
09:07 - and personally i am super uh fascinated
09:10 - and just very interested in watching
09:12 - what people are able to create with this
09:14 - technology
09:14 - because i can actually go in and read a
09:16 - little bit of research paper
09:17 - kind of understand what it is that
09:19 - they've done on a very very simple level
09:21 - and it's just a really really cool thing
09:23 - to be able to do and even when it comes
09:24 - to uh
09:25 - you know implementing some stuff in
09:26 - hobby projects for example i created a
09:28 - flappy bird ai
09:30 - like that is really interesting and
09:31 - really cool even though i made a youtube
09:33 - video on that
09:34 - i would have totally done that just for
09:36 - fun because it's just really fascinating
09:38 - to watch a computer
09:39 - learn and get better and understand
09:41 - patterns and trends
09:42 - anyways i think this is really cool i'll
09:44 - kind of terminate the point here because
09:45 - i could just keep going with all of
09:46 - these descriptive words
09:48 - but now let's move on to some of the
09:49 - cons of learning machine learning so the
09:51 - first con i have to share with you here
09:52 - is probably the number one reason why
09:54 - people don't get into machine learning
09:56 - and this is that it is pretty
09:57 - challenging and it can be very
09:58 - intimidating
09:59 - especially for people that have never
10:01 - programmed before and now we're being
10:03 - thrown
10:04 - into this world where not only do they
10:05 - have to write sometimes pretty advanced
10:07 - code but they also have to understand a
10:09 - lot of mathematical concepts
10:11 - to really grasp what is going on in
10:14 - these machine learning models
10:15 - so that's kind of the first con here if
10:17 - you want to get good at machine learning
10:19 - this is not something you're going to do
10:20 - overnight you're not going to learn it
10:21 - in a month or a week or something like
10:23 - that this is going to take time a lot of
10:25 - practice
10:26 - and can definitely be very frustrating
10:27 - and intimidating as you're getting into
10:29 - it at the start
10:30 - especially if you're someone who's
10:31 - younger i see a lot of people on my
10:32 - channel that are very young like 13
10:34 - 14 15 that want to go and build ai and
10:37 - that's great i definitely encourage them
10:39 - to try to do that
10:40 - but you will reach a point where your
10:42 - lack of math
10:43 - understanding may hold you back and then
10:45 - you're going to have to spend time
10:46 - learning some fairly advanced math
10:48 - concepts like linear algebra
10:50 - calculus gradient descent for example
10:52 - they may be very hard to comprehend and
10:54 - may just
10:55 - kind of be frustrating and discourage
10:56 - you from going further in this field
10:59 - so you can say this is a con you can say
11:00 - this is a pro because it's challenging
11:02 - and you want to learn it
11:03 - but one of the main reasons people don't
11:04 - get into this is because it isn't
11:06 - something that's super simple and unlike
11:08 - programming
11:09 - you do actually need to have a decent
11:11 - math background at least in my opinion
11:13 - to really make good use and understand
11:15 - what is going on
11:16 - in machine learning so the second con i
11:18 - have for you is that machine learning
11:20 - can be
11:20 - very frustrating and time consuming and
11:22 - often times your efforts can lead to
11:24 - absolutely nothing
11:26 - so i'm going to compare this to
11:27 - programming when you are writing code
11:29 - at least you have some code right even
11:31 - if your code doesn't work at all
11:33 - you can go and kind of fix it you can
11:35 - tweak it you can find where the bugs are
11:37 - that might be difficult but you can do
11:38 - that you have some work it's not just
11:40 - all gone it's not meaningless you've
11:41 - done something
11:42 - however when you make a machine learning
11:44 - model a lot of times especially if you
11:46 - don't know what you're doing
11:47 - you can get to the end of your you know
11:49 - eight hour training process
11:50 - just to realize that your model doesn't
11:52 - work at all it doesn't do anything that
11:54 - you thought it was gonna do
11:55 - you have no idea what is wrong you don't
11:57 - even know where to start when it comes
11:58 - to debugging there's so many different
12:00 - things that could be wrong with this
12:01 - and it's just a very time consuming and
12:03 - oftentimes very frustrating process
12:05 - now that may be trumped by the reward
12:07 - you get when you actually get a proper
12:09 - model
12:09 - but i can say in my experience there's
12:11 - been times when i've just given up on
12:12 - machine learning projects
12:13 - because it's been too frustrating it's
12:15 - been too difficult and i just didn't
12:16 - even know what to try next
12:18 - because there's so many different things
12:20 - and it just seemed like it wasn't worth
12:21 - my time
12:22 - so that is the second con frustrating
12:24 - time consuming and often times your
12:26 - effort leads to absolutely nothing
12:28 - so the last con i have for you here is
12:30 - that taking a machine learning model
12:32 - and applying it at scale and actually
12:34 - taking it from your development
12:36 - environment
12:36 - into a production environment can be
12:38 - very very difficult
12:40 - it's one thing to create a machine
12:41 - learning model that you can use on your
12:42 - own local machine and can serve you a
12:44 - few recommendations predictions whatever
12:46 - but it's another thing to take that
12:48 - machine learning model
12:49 - go and host that up on some cloud
12:51 - provider aws
12:52 - whatever and now have this work for say
12:55 - millions of customers per month
12:56 - or work on your website or be deeply
12:58 - integrated with your application
12:59 - that is a whole another story and
13:02 - companies like google you know facebook
13:04 - amazon
13:04 - their entire business model is pretty
13:06 - much predicated on the fact that they
13:08 - are able to do that
13:09 - so this is not something that's easy
13:11 - this is difficult and again that goes
13:12 - back to point number two
13:14 - you could do all this effort even get a
13:15 - machine learning model that works
13:17 - but how the heck do you actually use it
13:19 - in your application that's a whole
13:20 - nother step that could take a whole
13:22 - another few months or weeks of learning
13:24 - to actually pull off correctly so
13:26 - anyways i think i'm going to leave the
13:27 - video here
13:28 - hopefully this opened your eyes a little
13:29 - bit to how machine learning is used some
13:31 - of the pros and cons
13:33 - and maybe encourage you to learn it or
13:34 - kind of maybe give you the idea that you
13:36 - want to try a different path
13:37 - regardless if you do want to learn
13:39 - machine learning definitely check out
13:40 - the sponsor of this video machine
13:41 - learning expert
13:42 - again a massive thank you to ryan for
13:44 - helping with some of the prep
13:45 - for this video if you guys enjoyed make
13:47 - sure to leave a like subscribe to the
13:49 - channel
13:49 - i will see you in another youtube video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be discussing if i think that you should learn machine learning and the reason i'm making this video is because recently there has been a ton of hype related to machine learning and ai and it seems like everybody wants to dive into this field regardless of their background and even beginner programmers are constantly asking me should i get into machine learning where should i get started i want to build ai so on and so forth so in this video what i'll do is share some advantages and disadvantages kind of pros and cons of getting into machine learning and hopefully help answer the question if machine learning is right for you and if you should start on the path of kind of getting into ai and ml regardless if you're someone who knows that you want to get into machine learning there is an awesome platform i need to share with you which is called machine learning expert which happens to be the sponsor of this video before we get started i need to thank algo expert for sponsoring this video and having me talk to you about their awesome new product machine learning expert ml expert is a

infrastructure engineer that is a true machine learning expert check out ml expert today from the link in the description and use the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so let's go ahead and dive into the video here the first thing i'm going to do is just share with you a very interesting story that was actually told to me by my marketing professor i took a marketing class probably about a year ago and it relates to machine learning and how machine learning is used for marketing efforts for large retail chains like walmart costco so on and so forth so if you don't want to hear that story feel free to fast forward i'll put some kind of timestamps in the description but i found it really interesting interesting enough that i'm going to share it with you here so i'm going to start by sharing a little bit of context here as it relates to retail stores and their use of machine learning so retail stores have been using machine learning for a very long time even probably before social media although i would assume it'd be a lot less advanced than it is now but they've been using it for a long time to optimize things like what products you should have on what shelves where you should lay out stores how to optimize foot traffic in the store how many staff you should have each day based on the volume of transactions what time of year you want to have certain products in store right they've been doing that all the time and that's one of the reasons why they're very successful is they have mass amounts of data and information and they run them through these advanced machine learning models that are able to actually help them increase revenue profits uh decrease costs so on and so forth one of the main things that retail chains like this use machine learning for is marketing right they want to be able to target you with specific ad campaigns and they want to entice you to come in and buy stuff that is really the end end goal of machine learning make money right in a lot of cases so anyways this story here kind of starts with this woman who goes into costco or walmart one of these very large retail chains and she's using a rewards card now whenever you use a rewards card to use the same credit card constantly or you give an email or something to a store they start building a profile on you and keeping track of everything that that you buy they know when you bought it what time you bought it how much you spent your average purchase price they know all of these things and they're able to build a pretty detailed profile on you and start making pretty accurate guesses on when you're going to come in next what you're buying frequently what they should try to encourage you to buy and then from that profile they will specifically target ads towards you by sending you know coupons to you or sending emails with discounts whatever right they'll target you with ads based on what is that you've bought so the story kind of goes like this this young woman is going into this walmart this costco as i was saying she's using a rewards card and so they're able to build this profile on her on what she's purchasing and what she's purchasing is a lot of stuff related to pregnancy they're kind of an expecting mother what you might buy if you're expecting to have a baby right and so she's buying all of this stuff and i guess the machine learning model that's sending out these coupons kind of realizes that this picks it up and all of a sudden sends a coupon booklet to her address where she's still living with her parents and all of these coupons are related to stuff that she's been purchasing right trying to entice her to come back and buy more giving her coupons for you know diapers pregnancy related items and so the dad takes this coupon box from the mail and starts reading through it and realizes that everything here is related to pregnancy pretty much right and so he is extremely upset super pissed he thinks that this walmart this costco is trying to entice his daughter to go and get pregnant or do whatever it is that he thinks they're doing and so he sends all these nasty emails calls up the manager blah blah blah and is all upset about it but then goes and talks to his daughter and realizes that his daughter actually is pregnant and then kind of has to go back on the email and say sorry we had a long discussion blah blah but i just thought that was an interesting story because that kind of shows you the power of machine learning this machine learning model was able to identify that this woman was pregnant before her own father now obviously this is probably a rare case or a strange situation but it just kind of emphasized to me the power of machine learning and how it actually is used so heavily in our daily lives that we may not realize and well that's kind of how i'm going to segue into this video here and start talking about some of the pros and cons of learning this so hopefully you guys enjoyed that story but now i'm going to get into the pros one of the first pros that i have to share with you here is that learning machine learning and understanding how it works and specifically its use cases and applications allows you to better understand how you are being influenced by machine learning models in your everyday life because machine learning really is everywhere it's actually kind of scary how much stuff is using machine learning and how much data companies and just the internet in general has on you and by having some kind of insight and background in this field hopefully that allows you to act a little bit more independently and realize the conscious and subconscious effects of all of these recommendations and machine learning models that really are impacting you on a daytoday life so that is pro number one so the second pro i have for you here is that understanding machine learning even on a very basic rudimentary level allows you to take any data that you may have even if it's not mass amounts of data even if it's not business related data even if it's something super personal like your average calendar or schedule or daily routines whatever it may be you can take this data now run it through a machine learning model and actually find very very interesting patterns and information that you would never be able to see by simply analyzing this as a human humans just are not good at picking out patterns in data especially large volumes of data and machine learning models can expose very very interesting things even something super simple like putting in all of your grades into a calculator right or into a machine learning model story and trying to predict what average you're going to end up with next semester now of course there's a lot of other factors than your previous grades that are going to determine that but just really cool to take any data that you have and understand how you can turn this data which is relatively meaningless into actual information and there's a lot of quotes related to data and information but data is said to be pretty worthless unless you can turn it into some knowledge some information that you can actually utilize right and i know for myself someone that has a ton of data accessible to myself whether it be through my youtube channel whether it be through my discord server or my other social medias being able to actually analyze this data look at patterns run through models look at predictions and just see correlations between different things is really really helpful when it comes to determining you know what videos i'm going to make next how i'm going to increase revenue of my youtube channel what videos on the channel seem to attract more clicks so on and so forth i'm just trying to kind of open you up to the idea of if you have some data and you understand machine learning you can find some very very interesting piece of information from this so that's kind of point number two hard to elaborate too much more give you any great examples because i don't know your own use cases but if you're someone who runs a small business or just has any data in front of you learning machine learning is definitely going to be very valuable and you're going to see some pretty interesting patterns and information likely from this data that you do have so now the third pro i have for you when it comes to learning machine learning is that you get to be a part of a constantly evolving field that is genuinely changing the way in which humans live you know either in a good or bad way you can make that argument for yourself and you can now understand stateoftheart research that's going on in these fields and actually be a part of this in some sense now some of you may argue that because you know you're not very good at machine learning or you're just getting started you're not really a part of this you know constantly evolving and very exciting field but i would beg to differ because even just having that basic understanding as i was saying allows you to really appreciate what is being created by the absolute geniuses out there you know even something like tesla selfdriving uh you know chess ais like stock fish or alpha zero all of these really cool things that are coming out it just gives you an appreciation for them and personally i am super uh fascinated and just very interested in watching what people are able to create with this technology because i can actually go in and read a little bit of research paper kind of understand what it is that they've done on a very very simple level and it's just a really really cool thing to be able to do and even when it comes to uh you know implementing some stuff in hobby projects for example i created a flappy bird ai like that is really interesting and really cool even though i made a youtube video on that i would have totally done that just for fun because it's just really fascinating to watch a computer learn and get better and understand patterns and trends anyways i think this is really cool i'll kind of terminate the point here because i could just keep going with all of these descriptive words but now let's move on to some of the cons of learning machine learning so the first con i have to share with you here is probably the number one reason why people don't get into machine learning and this is that it is pretty challenging and it can be very intimidating especially for people that have never programmed before and now we're being thrown into this world where not only do they have to write sometimes pretty advanced code but they also have to understand a lot of mathematical concepts to really grasp what is going on in these machine learning models so that's kind of the first con here if you want to get good at machine learning this is not something you're going to do overnight you're not going to learn it in a month or a week or something like that this is going to take time a lot of practice and can definitely be very frustrating and intimidating as you're getting into it at the start especially if you're someone who's younger i see a lot of people on my channel that are very young like 13 14 15 that want to go and build ai and that's great i definitely encourage them to try to do that but you will reach a point where your lack of math understanding may hold you back and then you're going to have to spend time learning some fairly advanced math concepts like linear algebra calculus gradient descent for example they may be very hard to comprehend and may just kind of be frustrating and discourage you from going further in this field so you can say this is a con you can say this is a pro because it's challenging and you want to learn it but one of the main reasons people don't get into this is because it isn't something that's super simple and unlike programming you do actually need to have a decent math background at least in my opinion to really make good use and understand what is going on in machine learning so the second con i have for you is that machine learning can be very frustrating and time consuming and often times your efforts can lead to absolutely nothing so i'm going to compare this to programming when you are writing code at least you have some code right even if your code doesn't work at all you can go and kind of fix it you can tweak it you can find where the bugs are that might be difficult but you can do that you have some work it's not just all gone it's not meaningless you've done something however when you make a machine learning model a lot of times especially if you don't know what you're doing you can get to the end of your you know eight hour training process just to realize that your model doesn't work at all it doesn't do anything that you thought it was gonna do you have no idea what is wrong you don't even know where to start when it comes to debugging there's so many different things that could be wrong with this and it's just a very time consuming and oftentimes very frustrating process now that may be trumped by the reward you get when you actually get a proper model but i can say in my experience there's been times when i've just given up on machine learning projects because it's been too frustrating it's been too difficult and i just didn't even know what to try next because there's so many different things and it just seemed like it wasn't worth my time so that is the second con frustrating time consuming and often times your effort leads to absolutely nothing so the last con i have for you here is that taking a machine learning model and applying it at scale and actually taking it from your development environment into a production environment can be very very difficult it's one thing to create a machine learning model that you can use on your own local machine and can serve you a few recommendations predictions whatever but it's another thing to take that machine learning model go and host that up on some cloud provider aws whatever and now have this work for say millions of customers per month or work on your website or be deeply integrated with your application that is a whole another story and companies like google you know facebook amazon their entire business model is pretty much predicated on the fact that they are able to do that so this is not something that's easy this is difficult and again that goes back to point number two you could do all this effort even get a machine learning model that works but how the heck do you actually use it in your application that's a whole nother step that could take a whole another few months or weeks of learning to actually pull off correctly so anyways i think i'm going to leave the video here hopefully this opened your eyes a little bit to how machine learning is used some of the pros and cons and maybe encourage you to learn it or kind of maybe give you the idea that you want to try a different path regardless if you do want to learn machine learning definitely check out the sponsor of this video machine learning expert again a massive thank you to ryan for helping with some of the prep for this video if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel i will see you in another youtube video
