00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video what I'm going to be doing is
00:03 - sharing with you my top five picks for
00:05 - the best programming language to learn
00:07 - in 2020 now before we get into those
00:09 - picks I want to quickly discuss the
00:11 - criteria that I've used to decide these
00:13 - and to rank these different languages
00:15 - now the first thing that I always
00:16 - consider when I look at a programming
00:18 - language is how mainstream or well-known
00:21 - this language is how well-established is
00:24 - it is it stable has it been around for a
00:26 - long time now obviously more newer
00:29 - languages or languages that have just
00:30 - come out can't really win on this front
00:32 - but I think it's something that's
00:33 - important to consider to make sure that
00:35 - you're going to learn a language that is
00:36 - going to be around for a long time the
00:38 - next thing that I like to look at is
00:40 - popularity so not just in terms of how
00:42 - many people are using the language but
00:44 - is it being learned more and more day by
00:46 - day are more people looking it up are
00:48 - less people looking at the language it's
00:50 - something to consider and languages that
00:52 - are growing in popularity are obviously
00:54 - going to be favorable for us to want to
00:56 - learn for the future the next thing is
00:58 - going to be the tools frameworks and
01:00 - libraries that come with this language
01:02 - there that have been built off of this
01:03 - language that's very important that's
01:05 - some of the reasons why some of the
01:06 - languages that are on our list are there
01:08 - is because of the amazing frameworks
01:10 - that come with them and what it allows
01:12 - you to do with the language itself next
01:14 - we're gonna get into a little bit about
01:15 - the job market so you know how many jobs
01:17 - are there for this specific position and
01:19 - what is the average salary look like for
01:21 - ones that we can actually find the
01:23 - statistics for and then finally what is
01:25 - learning this language actually going to
01:27 - do for you so not just for a company
01:30 - that wants to hire you or for getting
01:31 - paid what is this gonna do for your
01:33 - professional and skill development and
01:35 - is this gonna help you possibly learn
01:37 - another language in the future and
01:38 - become a better programmer I think
01:40 - that's something a lot of people skim
01:41 - over and that's a point that I'm gonna
01:43 - try to make a lot through this video is
01:44 - what this language will actually do for
01:46 - you as a programmer and allow you to
01:48 - move on towards you know in your future
01:50 - career or future programming experience
01:52 - so with that being said let's get into
01:54 - my top 5 picks for the best programming
01:56 - language to learn in 2020 before we get
01:58 - started I need to thank simply learn for
02:00 - sponsoring this video and introducing
02:02 - all of us to the whole stack web
02:04 - developer course called the mean stack
02:06 - master's program in this course you'll
02:08 - master back-end and front-end JavaScript
02:09 - technologies using MongoDB Express
02:12 - angular and know
02:13 - AAS you learn tools and skills like node
02:16 - packet manager sqlite3 typescript
02:18 - bootstrap and many others you'll gain
02:21 - in-depth knowledge of no SQL principles
02:23 - like data modeling and ingestion and
02:24 - work on seven real-life industry based
02:27 - projects you'll build dynamic and
02:29 - interact web pages using HTML and CSS
02:31 - and be able to pick between electives
02:33 - like react Jas and docker compose start
02:36 - mastering web development today by
02:37 - hitting the link in the description and
02:39 - signing up for the mean stack masters
02:41 - program so coming in at pick number five
02:44 - I have C and C++
02:46 - now I've grouped these languages
02:47 - together because I believe they're
02:49 - similar enough that we can talk about
02:50 - them in the same category for this video
02:52 - and when we're talking about languages
02:54 - being well established and mainstream I
02:56 - would say there's no better example than
02:58 - that then C and C++ now C and C++ are
03:01 - some of the most well established
03:03 - languages that exist they're used by
03:05 - millions of different developers across
03:07 - millions of different organizations
03:09 - around the world and they've been around
03:11 - for such a long time that there's
03:12 - amazing community behind these languages
03:14 - and tons of different resources online
03:17 - to be able to learn them now when it
03:19 - comes to the popularity of this language
03:21 - or these languages I would say it's been
03:23 - decreasing as the years go on but the
03:25 - reason for that would likely be that new
03:27 - beginners picking up new programming
03:29 - languages in the past few years wouldn't
03:31 - really be introduced to C or C++ as
03:33 - their first language and therefore
03:35 - there's less people learning it that
03:37 - doesn't mean that there's less jobs and
03:39 - that it's less in demand in fact looking
03:40 - at the job market for C and C++ we can
03:43 - see that it stayed fairly stable over
03:45 - the past few years and although there's
03:46 - not a massive surge and boom and these
03:48 - kind of jobs with developing and C and
03:50 - C++ they're not they don't look to be
03:53 - going anywhere just because so many
03:55 - organizations use this as their core
03:57 - code for a lot of their systems and that
04:00 - again is because C and C++ is super fast
04:02 - it's super capable there's nothing that
04:05 - you can't really do if you know C or C++
04:07 - and this brings me into my last point
04:09 - which is learning C and C++ is only
04:12 - gonna make you a better programmer even
04:14 - if you're not looking to do this as your
04:15 - career or your job I would definitely
04:17 - recommend looking into it or at least
04:19 - you know getting a general idea what
04:21 - it's like to program in C and C++
04:23 - because it's much different than a lot
04:25 - of these hireling
04:26 - that we see today and learning to use
04:28 - something like this just makes you a
04:30 - much better programmer finally the
04:32 - salary the average salary of a C++
04:35 - developer in the United States here is
04:37 - listed at a hundred six thousand US
04:39 - dollars I'm going to be using indeed for
04:41 - all of these salary kind of insights or
04:43 - averages these are gonna change and vary
04:45 - depending on where you're located your
04:47 - age your amount of experience and all of
04:49 - that but this is what the average I'm
04:51 - getting is from indeed so anyways that's
04:52 - my pick number five C and C++ so coming
04:56 - in at pick number four I have Java now
04:59 - Java is also a very well-established
05:00 - programming language it's been around
05:02 - for a very long time
05:04 - it's trusted it's reliable and it's used
05:06 - for very large complex systems which we
05:09 - can't say about a lot of the other
05:11 - languages that I'll be mentioning later
05:12 - on now Java is a great language a lot of
05:15 - people seem to think that it's been
05:16 - dying down in popularity
05:18 - I wouldn't necessarily agree with that I
05:20 - think it's been staying fairly level if
05:22 - not increasing a slight amount the
05:24 - reason a lot of people seem to think
05:25 - that Java is dying is because a lot of
05:28 - these other newer programming languages
05:30 - are so kind of surpassing it in the
05:32 - ranks but that doesn't mean that Java is
05:34 - not still used by millions of different
05:36 - organizations around the world and has
05:39 - one of the largest code bases on github
05:41 - so I believe it's actually ranked the
05:43 - third or the fourth most contributed
05:46 - code on github something around the line
05:47 - so that someone can correct me if I'm
05:49 - wrong on that and there's a ton of
05:51 - open-source api's and libraries for Java
05:53 - so this essentially means that you can
05:55 - do pretty much anything with Java code
05:57 - as well I wouldn't say it's as capable
06:00 - and flexible as something like C or C++
06:02 - but when it comes to building out
06:04 - large-scale systems job is a great
06:06 - option for that and it's not as complex
06:09 - and difficult to learn as a language
06:10 - like C or C++ it also runs on the JVM
06:14 - which means that you can scale this to
06:16 - pretty much any device or platform you
06:18 - want you can run this on a server you
06:20 - can run this on iOS you can put this on
06:22 - you know pretty much anything you want
06:24 - right you can make that stuff
06:25 - applications and when it comes to the
06:27 - job market there's so many jobs in Java
06:29 - development because this is what so many
06:31 - companies have been trusting and using
06:33 - since they've been founded or since they
06:35 - even existed as their core technology so
06:37 - knowing Java you will most likely be
06:39 - able
06:40 - to get a job and I believe the average
06:41 - salary of a Java developer is 90,000 now
06:45 - one of the reasons I like telling people
06:46 - to learn Java is if they're coming from
06:48 - a background say like Python or a
06:50 - scripting language or something that's
06:52 - not statically typed moving to a
06:54 - statically typed language and learning
06:56 - Java it's not that difficult a lot of
06:58 - the syntax is similar to something
06:59 - you've seen before but it really shows
07:01 - you how important structure in your code
07:03 - can be and allows you to get a really
07:05 - good kind of fundamentals and
07:06 - understanding of object-oriented design
07:08 - so I think it's a great language to
07:10 - learn in 2020 especially if you're
07:11 - someone who's only been doing scripting
07:13 - languages beforehand so the next
07:15 - language on my list coming in at rank
07:17 - number three is go otherwise known as
07:19 - golang now for those of you that don't
07:21 - know much about Go Go is a statically
07:23 - typed compiled language that's built on
07:26 - a functional programming paradigm now
07:28 - what that means is there's actually no
07:30 - object orientated programming or style
07:32 - even built into the language go you can
07:35 - kind of try to simulate it but instead
07:36 - of using objects and classes and
07:38 - actually use something called Struck's
07:39 - now--go is actually built around
07:42 - concurrent programming so making
07:44 - concurrency really easy to implement
07:45 - into the program and I almost like to
07:48 - compare it to almost a high-performance
07:49 - version of Python so the language itself
07:51 - is actually very simple it's a pretty
07:54 - small in comparison like if we're
07:56 - looking at the amount of keywords and
07:57 - just the amount of features built into
07:58 - the language itself but it's very very
08:00 - powerful and building high performance
08:03 - almost scripts very quickly is something
08:04 - that go is really good at so that's the
08:06 - way I like to the way you can kind of
08:08 - think about go is a high-performance
08:09 - version of Python it does a lot of
08:11 - similar things that Python will be able
08:13 - to do like it does some web development
08:14 - stuff some enterprise applications you
08:16 - can pretty much do anything you want
08:18 - with go as well and since it's compiled
08:20 - that means it's pretty easy to transfer
08:22 - your go applications to different
08:24 - computers now in terms of being well
08:26 - established I would say go is probably a
08:27 - little bit away from getting to that
08:29 - point there's not a huge community
08:31 - around at least from what I've seen on
08:32 - the internet myself doing some research
08:34 - and I think in the next few years we're
08:36 - gonna see grow go continue to rise in
08:39 - popularity may become one of the
08:40 - mainstream languages now right now in
08:42 - terms of popularity go has been kind of
08:45 - booming and just skyrocketing over the
08:47 - past few years more people have been
08:49 - learning about it figuring out what it
08:50 - does and you know
08:51 - falling in love with NGO the language
08:53 - itself so that's why I've ranked it at
08:55 - number three here I can see in the next
08:57 - maybe five ten years actually probably a
08:59 - little bit shorter than that go becoming
09:01 - one of the next mean stream languages I
09:03 - think it's really powerful it's really
09:04 - interesting and learning it is gonna
09:06 - show you a different style of
09:08 - programming that you've probably never
09:09 - been introduced to before in terms of
09:11 - average salary and jobs those figures
09:13 - are hard to determine just because this
09:16 - language is so new so I'm gonna stick
09:18 - from not telling you anything about them
09:19 - as I don't want to mislead anyone but I
09:21 - would definitely recommend at least
09:22 - looking into go and considering learning
09:24 - it as your next language in 2020 and
09:26 - coming in at number 2 we have JavaScript
09:30 - now I'm sure this is no surprise to any
09:32 - of you but JavaScript back in the day I
09:34 - would say maybe you know seven eight
09:36 - years ago was really not nearly as big
09:39 - as it was today it was something that
09:40 - was just used for kind of front-end web
09:42 - development work a lot of developers
09:44 - almost ridiculed JavaScript and we're
09:46 - like you know it's a horrible language
09:47 - personally when I started learning
09:48 - JavaScript when I was about that age you
09:50 - know eight years ago I didn't find it
09:52 - that useful but now with all of these
09:54 - new frameworks being invented for it
09:56 - something like you know react vous
09:58 - angular nodejs
10:00 - it's turned JavaScript from something
10:02 - that was just a great front-end web
10:03 - development language into a great
10:05 - multi-purpose programming language and
10:07 - now learning JavaScript not only can you
10:10 - do front-end web development but you can
10:11 - also do backend work you can do full
10:13 - stack you can do stuff with um you know
10:15 - client-server architectures you can go
10:18 - crazy with what you're gonna do with
10:19 - JavaScript because of all the things
10:21 - that have been invented recently for it
10:22 - now github is actually ranked JavaScript
10:25 - as the number one most contributed code
10:27 - for the past five years the average
10:30 - salary of a JavaScript developer in the
10:32 - u.s. is actually 114 thousand US dollars
10:34 - and there is a ton and increasing amount
10:37 - of jobs for javascript and it just seems
10:40 - like overall a great language to learn
10:41 - in 2020 it's pretty simple it you can
10:44 - learn it you know honestly I would say
10:46 - in a week or two especially if you're an
10:47 - experienced developer and becoming kind
10:49 - of a master at javascript now just means
10:52 - you can do so much more with your career
10:54 - and with the language in general and
10:56 - that's why I've put this language out
10:57 - number two I don't think I need to say
10:59 - much more about it you guys know how
11:00 - awesome javascript is now in 2020 and I
11:03 - think for anyone that wants to get a
11:05 - into the web development game or get a
11:07 - quick entry into programming that
11:08 - learning JavaScript is probably be one
11:10 - of your best bets so my number one pick
11:12 - for the best programming language to
11:14 - learn in 2020 is going to have to go to
11:17 - Python now I do have a slight bias here
11:19 - as my entire channel is pretty much
11:21 - based on Python and that's what I you
11:23 - know my kind of bread and butter is but
11:25 - despite that Python was actually ranked
11:27 - the fastest growing programming language
11:29 - according to github last year and also
11:31 - is the second most popular programming
11:33 - language based on code contributions on
11:35 - github and it's just in a really amazing
11:38 - language and tool to have under your
11:40 - belt as a developer it's great at doing
11:42 - so many different things from so many
11:44 - different domains no it might not be the
11:46 - best tool for every single project that
11:48 - you're gonna be working on but chances
11:50 - are if you know Python you need to do
11:53 - something you will be able to do that in
11:55 - Python there's a pretty well infinite
11:57 - amount of libraries and modules for
11:59 - Python code which allow you to do things
12:01 - like make games make websites desktop
12:04 - applications iOS applications Android
12:07 - apps you name it you can likely do it
12:09 - with Python and it's a really great
12:10 - language to get into and to learn
12:12 - especially if you're a beginner it's
12:13 - something that's so simple and just very
12:16 - easy to use but yet extremely powerful
12:19 - and that's one of the reasons that I
12:20 - recommend it as my top choice in my top
12:22 - programming language to learn in 2020
12:25 - now other than that the average salary
12:27 - of a Python developer in the US and this
12:29 - is the highest on the list so far is a
12:31 - hundred and twenty thousand US dollars
12:32 - annually and the amount of jobs for
12:35 - Python related work has been increasing
12:37 - steadily over the past few years and
12:40 - this year alone I think there was an
12:41 - increase of something like fifteen
12:43 - thousand jobs in the United States which
12:45 - is actually a substantial amount so
12:47 - Python is a great language again it's a
12:49 - general-purpose programming language
12:50 - there's nothing you really can't do with
12:52 - it and in terms of building a strong
12:54 - foundation learning Python is really
12:56 - gonna help you do that and it's gonna
12:58 - give you almost an appreciation for the
13:00 - simplicity built into the language
13:02 - versus some other languages that are
13:04 - more complex again like C++ so with that
13:07 - being said that has been my top 5 picks
13:09 - for the best programming languages to
13:11 - learn in 2020 do you agree with me do
13:14 - you horribly disagree let me know in the
13:16 - comments down below let's have a little
13:18 - about it with that being said I hope you
13:19 - guys enjoyed the video if you did leave
13:21 - a like subscribe to the channel and I
13:23 - will see you in another one

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I'm going to be doing is sharing with you my top five picks for the best programming language to learn in 2020 now before we get into those picks I want to quickly discuss the criteria that I've used to decide these and to rank these different languages now the first thing that I always consider when I look at a programming language is how mainstream or wellknown this language is how wellestablished is it is it stable has it been around for a long time now obviously more newer languages or languages that have just come out can't really win on this front but I think it's something that's important to consider to make sure that you're going to learn a language that is going to be around for a long time the next thing that I like to look at is popularity so not just in terms of how many people are using the language but is it being learned more and more day by day are more people looking it up are less people looking at the language it's something to consider and languages that are growing in popularity are obviously going to be favorable for us to want to learn for the future the next thing is going to be the tools frameworks and libraries that come with this language there that have been built off of this language that's very important that's some of the reasons why some of the languages that are on our list are there is because of the amazing frameworks that come with them and what it allows you to do with the language itself next we're gonna get into a little bit about the job market so you know how many jobs are there for this specific position and what is the average salary look like for ones that we can actually find the statistics for and then finally what is learning this language actually going to do for you so not just for a company that wants to hire you or for getting paid what is this gonna do for your professional and skill development and is this gonna help you possibly learn another language in the future and become a better programmer I think that's something a lot of people skim over and that's a point that I'm gonna try to make a lot through this video is what this language will actually do for you as a programmer and allow you to move on towards you know in your future career or future programming experience so with that being said let's get into my top 5 picks for the best programming language to learn in 2020 before we get started I need to thank simply learn for sponsoring this video and introducing all of us to the whole stack web developer course called the mean stack master's program in this course you'll master backend and frontend JavaScript technologies using MongoDB Express angular and know AAS you learn tools and skills like node packet manager sqlite3 typescript bootstrap and many others you'll gain indepth knowledge of no SQL principles like data modeling and ingestion and work on seven reallife industry based projects you'll build dynamic and interact web pages using HTML and CSS and be able to pick between electives like react Jas and docker compose start mastering web development today by hitting the link in the description and signing up for the mean stack masters program so coming in at pick number five I have C and C++ now I've grouped these languages together because I believe they're similar enough that we can talk about them in the same category for this video and when we're talking about languages being well established and mainstream I would say there's no better example than that then C and C++ now C and C++ are some of the most well established languages that exist they're used by millions of different developers across millions of different organizations around the world and they've been around for such a long time that there's amazing community behind these languages and tons of different resources online to be able to learn them now when it comes to the popularity of this language or these languages I would say it's been decreasing as the years go on but the reason for that would likely be that new beginners picking up new programming languages in the past few years wouldn't really be introduced to C or C++ as their first language and therefore there's less people learning it that doesn't mean that there's less jobs and that it's less in demand in fact looking at the job market for C and C++ we can see that it stayed fairly stable over the past few years and although there's not a massive surge and boom and these kind of jobs with developing and C and C++ they're not they don't

hireling that we see today and learning to use something like this just makes you a much better programmer finally the salary the average salary of a C++ developer in the United States here is listed at a hundred six thousand US dollars I'm going to be using indeed for all of these salary kind of insights or averages these are gonna change and vary depending on where you're located your age your amount of experience and all of that but this is what the average I'm getting is from indeed so anyways that's my pick number five C and C++ so coming in at pick number four I have Java now Java is also a very wellestablished programming language it's been around for a very long time it's trusted it's reliable and it's used for very large complex systems which we can't say about a lot of the other languages that I'll be mentioning later on now Java is a great language a lot of people seem to think that it's been dying down in popularity I wouldn't necessarily agree with that I think it's been staying fairly level if not increasing a slight amount the reason a lot of people seem to think that Java is dying is because a lot of these other newer programming languages are so kind of surpassing it in the ranks but that doesn't mean that Java is not still used by millions of different organizations around the world and has one of the largest code bases on github so I believe it's actually ranked the third or the fourth most contributed code on github something around the line so that someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that and there's a ton of opensource api's and libraries for Java so this essentially means that you can do pretty much anything with Java code as well I wouldn't say it's as capable and flexible as something like C or C++ but when it comes to building out largescale systems job is a great option for that and it's not as complex and difficult to learn as a language like C or C++ it also runs on the JVM which means that you can scale this to pretty much any device or platform you want you can run this on a server you can run this on iOS you can put this on you know pretty much anything you want right you can make that stuff applications and when it comes to the job market there's so many jobs in Java development because this is what so many companies have been trusting and using since they've been founded or since they even existed as their core technology so knowing Java you will most likely be able to get a job and I believe the average salary of a Java developer is 90,000 now one of the reasons I like telling people to learn Java is if they're coming from a background say like Python or a scripting language or something that's not statically typed moving to a statically typed language and learning Java it's not that difficult a lot of the syntax is similar to something you've seen before but it really shows you how important structure in your code can be and allows you to get a really good kind of fundamentals and understanding of objectoriented design so I think it's a great language to learn in 2020 especially if you're someone who's only been doing scripting languages beforehand so the next language on my list coming in at rank number three is go otherwise known as golang now for those of you that don't know much about Go Go is a statically typed compiled language that's built on a functional programming paradigm now what that means is there's actually no object orientated programming or style even built into the language go you can kind of try to simulate it but instead of using objects and classes and actually use something called Struck's nowgo is actually built around concurrent programming so making concurrency really easy to implement into the program and I almost like to compare it to almost a highperformance version of Python so the language itself is actually very simple it's a pretty small in comparison like if we're looking at the amount of keywords and just the amount of features built into the language itself but it's very very powerful and building high performance almost scripts very quickly is something that go is really good at so that's the way I like to the way you can kind of think about go is a highperformance version of Python it does a lot of similar things that Python will be able to do like it does some web development stuff some enterprise applications you can pretty much do anything you want with go as well and since it's compiled that means it's pretty easy to transfer your go applications to different computers now in terms of being well established I would say go is probably a little bit away from getting to that point there's not a huge community around at least from what I've seen on the internet myself doing some research and I think in the next few years we're gonna see grow go continue to rise in popularity may become one of the mainstream languages now right now in terms of popularity go has been kind of booming and just skyrocketing over the past few years more people have been learning about it figuring out what it does and you know falling in love with NGO the language itself so that's why I've ranked it at number three here I can see in the next maybe five ten years actually probably a little bit shorter than that go becoming one of the next mean stream languages I think it's really powerful it's really interesting and learning it is gonna show you a different style of programming that you've probably never been introduced to before in terms of average salary and jobs those figures are hard to determine just because this language is so new so I'm gonna stick from not telling you anything about them as I don't want to mislead anyone but I would definitely recommend at least looking into go and considering learning it as your next language in 2020 and coming in at number 2 we have JavaScript now I'm sure this is no surprise to any of you but JavaScript back in the day I would say maybe you know seven eight years ago was really not nearly as big as it was today it was something that was just used for kind of frontend web development work a lot of developers almost ridiculed JavaScript and we're like you know it's a horrible language personally when I started learning JavaScript when I was about that age you know eight years ago I didn't find it that useful but now with all of these new frameworks being invented for it something like you know react vous angular nodejs it's turned JavaScript from something that was just a great frontend web development language into a great multipurpose programming language and now learning JavaScript not only can you do frontend web development but you can also do backend work you can do full stack you can do stuff with um you know clientserver architectures you can go crazy with what you're gonna do with JavaScript because of all the things that have been invented recently for it now github is actually ranked JavaScript as the number one most contributed code for the past five years the average salary of a JavaScript developer in the u.s. is actually 114 thousand US dollars and there is a ton and increasing amount of jobs for javascript and it just seems like overall a great language to learn in 2020 it's pretty simple it you can learn it you know honestly I would say in a week or two especially if you're an experienced developer and becoming kind of a master at javascript now just means you can do so much more with your career and with the language in general and that's why I've put this language out number two I don't think I need to say much more about it you guys know how awesome javascript is now in 2020 and I think for anyone that wants to get a into the web development game or get a quick entry into programming that learning JavaScript is probably be one of your best bets so my number one pick for the best programming language to learn in 2020 is going to have to go to Python now I do have a slight bias here as my entire channel is pretty much based on Python and that's what I you know my kind of bread and butter is but despite that Python was actually ranked the fastest growing programming language according to github last year and also is the second most popular programming language based on code contributions on github and it's just in a really amazing language and tool to have under your belt as a developer it's great at doing so many different things from so many different domains no it might not be the best tool for every single project that you're gonna be working on but chances are if you know Python you need to do something you will be able to do that in Python there's a pretty well infinite amount of libraries and modules for Python code which allow you to do things like make games make websites desktop applications iOS applications Android apps you name it you can likely do it with Python and it's a really great language to get into and to learn especially if you're a beginner it's something that's so simple and just very easy to use but yet extremely powerful and that's one of the reasons that I recommend it as my top choice in my top programming language to learn in 2020 now other than that the average salary of a Python developer in the US and this is the highest on the list so far is a hundred and twenty thousand US dollars annually and the amount of jobs for Python related work has been increasing steadily over the past few years and this year alone I think there was an increase of something like fifteen thousand jobs in the United States which is actually a substantial amount so Python is a great language again it's a generalpurpose programming language there's nothing you really can't do with it and in terms of building a strong foundation learning Python is really gonna help you do that and it's gonna give you almost an appreciation for the simplicity built into the language versus some other languages that are more complex again like C++ so with that being said that has been my top 5 picks for the best programming languages to learn in 2020 do you agree with me do you horribly disagree let me know in the comments down below let's have a little about it with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in another one
