00:00 - how efficient are you using different
00:02 - software engineering tools so like an
00:04 - IDE maybe GitHub Version Control maybe
00:07 - you're really good in the command line
00:08 - with terminal and stuff like that and
00:10 - you can even extend this to different
00:12 - framer so one thing that I always try to
00:14 - do when I'm using different softwares is
00:16 - I try to think about how can I make
00:18 - myself more efficient here what's
00:19 - something that I'm constantly doing
00:21 - maybe I should learn the shortcut for
00:22 - that maybe I need to add a keybind on my
00:24 - keyboard maybe I need to spend a few
00:26 - minutes really trying to learn this
00:28 - software better so that in the future
00:30 - I'm going to be more efficient with it
