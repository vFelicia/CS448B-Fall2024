00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video this is gonna be the
00:04 - second video in my Python turtle
00:07 - programming series or a tutorial
00:09 - whatever I called it on there and in
00:11 - this video I'm going to be showing you
00:12 - how to fill shapes and how you can draw
00:15 - shapes kind of randomly on the screen
00:17 - now there's a few new things that I have
00:19 - that I'm gonna be going over in just a
00:21 - minute but I just want to say if you
00:23 - guys aren't really interested in shapes
00:24 - and you kind of want to learn some
00:25 - cooler stuff maybe just head on to the
00:28 - next video in that video I'm going to be
00:29 - showing you what happens when you have
00:31 - mouse click events and key click events
00:33 - and how you can kind of drag the turtle
00:36 - around and it can draw based on where
00:37 - your mouse is going and that one's cool
00:39 - as well I still recommend you watch this
00:41 - video just you have some more basics of
00:43 - the turtle module but if you're not
00:44 - interested in that go ahead and hop over
00:46 - to the next one alright so let's go
00:48 - ahead and get started so again at the
00:50 - beginning of our program I've just
00:51 - written a little starter file here just
00:53 - to save some time we import turtle I do
00:55 - import random just because I'm gonna do
00:57 - something cool at the end of the video
00:58 - but I'm just leaving up there now and I
01:01 - have Tim equals turtle turtle creating
01:03 - again a new turtle object and then I
01:06 - have this list of colors again we're not
01:07 - going to use right now and then set the
01:09 - color for the turtle so we go red and
01:12 - then this is a little bit different from
01:13 - the last video so red is going to be our
01:15 - outline color and blue is gonna be our
01:18 - fill color so by simply putting a comma
01:19 - here we can separate those setting the
01:22 - pen width of the turtle width which is
01:24 - going to be width of 5 and then this is
01:27 - how we fill in a shape so to fill in the
01:30 - shape we start by writing our total
01:31 - objects Tim dot begin fill after that we
01:35 - can draw whatever we want and after
01:37 - we're done we hit end fill and it's
01:39 - gonna fill in the shape it just drew so
01:42 - when we make a circle of radius 50 and
01:45 - this one is new so inside circle it
01:48 - creates a circle of radius 50 then it's
01:52 - gonna end the fill and we can see what
01:54 - happens when I run the program now don't
01:56 - think you can go ahead and do turtle to
01:58 - Tim's square Tim triangle doesn't work
02:01 - like that there's only one for circle
02:03 - okay so let's go ahead and run the
02:05 - program and see what happens
02:07 - there we go so we get a circle and it's
02:10 - filled in blue pretty straightforward
02:12 - now I'm going to show you
02:14 - how we would do a square per say it's
02:16 - the same kind of idea but I'm showing
02:18 - you guys anyways so first I'm just gonna
02:20 - move my pen up off the screen so we're
02:22 - not drawing and I'm moving my turtle I'm
02:24 - gonna go Tim go forward 150 pixels get
02:29 - out of the way and Tim dot and down now
02:33 - I do also want to change the color so
02:35 - I'm gonna get Tim color and in this case
02:37 - let's do yellow and black like that and
02:42 - see how that looks and now I'm gonna go
02:45 - ahead and draw a square so the you can
02:47 - draw a square by using like Tim dot
02:49 - forward
02:50 - Tim dot right Tim go for Tim dot right
02:51 - and having eight lines of code or you
02:54 - can do the easy way by creating a for
02:56 - loop so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna show
02:58 - you guys how it works so 4x in range for
03:01 - Tim dot forward 100 pixels and then Tim
03:07 - dot right nine
03:10 - now this is gonna execute four times
03:14 - we're gonna go forward ones turn right
03:16 - at forward ones turn right and it's
03:17 - gonna end up creating a square now
03:19 - that's a much easier way to do it then
03:21 - just keep writing out forward right
03:23 - forward right it's just kind of a pain
03:25 - now I also want to fill it this in so
03:27 - what I'm gonna do is before I start
03:28 - drawing the objects I'm gonna do Tim dot
03:29 - begin underscore bill and then Tim dot
03:34 - and underscore fill just like that and
03:37 - now we can go ahead and run the program
03:39 - and see what we get there we go
03:42 - so again really straightforward we have
03:45 - the circle and then bill the screen we
03:46 - move to the right and then we draw the
03:47 - rectangle filled in now that's pretty
03:50 - much all the commands I'm gonna be
03:52 - showing you guys but stick around
03:54 - because what I'm gonna do now is show
03:56 - you how you would go about drawing
03:58 - random circles or random objects on the
04:00 - screen and it actually does use one
04:03 - command so I so I lied that I haven't
04:05 - shown you guys yet and that command is
04:06 - gonna be set underscore position like
04:09 - this okay so the way that positions work
04:13 - in turtle is unlike pi game if you've
04:15 - seen that let me just open up this
04:17 - window here quickly it's probably gonna
04:19 - crash because I didn't give it a
04:20 - position yep don't worry about that so
04:22 - right here where the circles drawn is
04:24 - the middle of our screen now
04:27 - the way it works here is if we can draw
04:29 - an axis here and an axis here then we
04:32 - can have a Cartesian kind of a plane
04:36 - right so here from right on if we have
04:39 - an imaginary line down the middle we
04:41 - have 0 1 2 3 4 for the X and then
04:44 - upwards so above this line we have 1 2 3
04:47 - 4 positive for the X so in this right
04:49 - quadrant here it's positive down here we
04:52 - have positive in the X and negative in
04:55 - the Y because we're underneath that
04:57 - horizontal line and I'm making with my
05:00 - mouse right now
05:00 - imaginary now if we move over into this
05:02 - furthest left quadrant here that means
05:04 - we're underneath the horizontal line or
05:06 - to the left of the what do you call it
05:09 - vertical line so we have negative for
05:13 - the x value so negative 1 negative 2
05:15 - negative 3 and negative for the Y values
05:17 - get negative 1 negative 2 negative 3
05:19 - going downwards again last quadrant top
05:22 - left we have negative for the X because
05:24 - again from this horizontal line which
05:26 - the left of it and then we're positive
05:28 - for the Y because we're above this
05:30 - horizontal line it's just an Cartesian
05:33 - plane it's really basic and if you guys
05:34 - don't understand just look up Cartesian
05:36 - plane on Google and I'm sure you can
05:38 - find something that can explain it to
05:40 - you or you help you visualize better so
05:43 - when I've set positions here if I want
05:45 - to move to the left of the middle of the
05:47 - screen then I have to do something like
05:49 - negative 200 and then if I want to be
05:52 - moving downwards I would go negative 150
05:55 - like so and that would put me in the
05:57 - bottom left quadrant of the screen so
05:59 - just explain that before I started using
06:00 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
06:03 - create the for loop I'm just going to go
06:05 - for X and range and this is going to be
06:07 - how many objects I want to draw so in
06:08 - this case I just want to do five and
06:10 - we're gonna make it really basic and I'm
06:11 - just gonna make a bunch of circles so
06:14 - what I won't need to do is I need to
06:15 - create two random integers so a way that
06:19 - we do that by importing random is we can
06:21 - do Rand 1 it's gonna be random dots Rand
06:27 - range and then I believe you can do this
06:30 - I'm gonna do negative 300 - 300 because
06:34 - again we need negative values so we can
06:36 - go to the left and down
06:38 - and now for rent - I'm gonna do the
06:41 - exact same thing we're just gonna be
06:43 - called rant - and there we go now what
06:48 - I'm when I set the position for my
06:50 - turtle I want to make sure that I have
06:52 - my pen up so that it doesn't draw a line
06:54 - while I'm moving the turtle that makes
06:56 - sense so I'm gonna do tim duck pen up
06:58 - set the position and we're just going to
07:01 - simply set an x-coordinate and a
07:03 - y-coordinate so we're gonna use R and 1
07:05 - as the X and ran to as the Y now I'm not
07:08 - sure if this has to come in as a tuple
07:10 - we'll test this out but excuse me if we
07:13 - get an error then I'm gonna put the pen
07:15 - down like that I'm gonna begin a fill so
07:19 - to begin the fill again we do Tim dog
07:21 - begin underscore oops
07:24 - yeah underscore fill like so and then I
07:28 - am going to go here I'm gonna draw a
07:31 - circle so the way we did is certainly
07:33 - got his Tim dog circle and in here I'm
07:35 - going to do random dog Rand ring and
07:40 - we're gonna put zero to 80 so we can get
07:44 - different size circles they're not all
07:45 - the same and end the fill right here
07:48 - oops not begin and underscore fill now I
07:52 - also would like to change the color of
07:54 - my turtle every time that I create a new
07:56 - object so the way I can do that is we
08:00 - need to create another random integer so
08:01 - in this case I'm just gonna call this R
08:03 - and call there like so and that's gonna
08:05 - be between say a Rand brand range like
08:12 - that and then in here we need to do zero
08:17 - and then the length of our couple is so
08:19 - zero and Len of colors like so now I
08:24 - know it's a lot of typing going on here
08:27 - we need to change the color of our
08:29 - turtle so timko there and then in here
08:33 - is going to be equal to colors brand
08:38 - color like so now I probably made a
08:41 - mistake here so forgive me but let's
08:43 - give it a try
08:44 - so we first start by drawing a circle
08:46 - then our square and has no attribute set
08:51 - ha
08:51 - okay let me just have a quick look at
08:54 - what the position is for setting here go
08:59 - to maybe go to is the one that we have
09:01 - to use set position set post
09:03 - oh no underscore that's what sorry about
09:05 - that guns so set pause is what we needed
09:08 - and hopefully this will work for us
09:10 - crossing our fingers there we go
09:13 - Circle Circle Circle and we're drawing
09:17 - random circles around the screen awesome
09:19 - so unfortunately we didn't get a too
09:21 - many variety of different colors but you
09:24 - can see how that works if we wanted to
09:26 - have a different fill color you can just
09:28 - do this do colors and then random branch
09:35 - range again zero blend colors like so
09:40 - and then that would give us a random
09:43 - fill color for our circles hopefully
09:46 - yeah there we go
09:47 - and we can see we get more of a variety
09:49 - now as they draw on the screen all right
09:52 - so that's been it for this video on
09:54 - python turtle graphics if you have any
09:57 - questions or anything you'd like to
09:59 - address just leave a comment down below
10:01 - I'd be more than happy to help you guys
10:02 - out and if you liked the video please
10:04 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
10:05 - and I will see you again in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video this is gonna be the second video in my Python turtle programming series or a tutorial whatever I called it on there and in this video I'm going to be showing you how to fill shapes and how you can draw shapes kind of randomly on the screen now there's a few new things that I have that I'm gonna be going over in just a minute but I just want to say if you guys aren't really interested in shapes and you kind of want to learn some cooler stuff maybe just head on to the next video in that video I'm going to be showing you what happens when you have mouse click events and key click events and how you can kind of drag the turtle around and it can draw based on where your mouse is going and that one's cool as well I still recommend you watch this video just you have some more basics of the turtle module but if you're not interested in that go ahead and hop over to the next one alright so let's go ahead and get started so again at the beginning of our program I've just written a little starter file here just to save some time we import turtle I do import random just because I'm gonna do something cool at the end of the video but I'm just leaving up there now and I have Tim equals turtle turtle creating again a new turtle object and then I have this list of colors again we're not going to use right now and then set the color for the turtle so we go red and then this is a little bit different from the last video so red is going to be our outline color and blue is gonna be our fill color so by simply putting a comma here we can separate those setting the pen width of the turtle width which is going to be width of 5 and then this is how we fill in a shape so to fill in the shape we start by writing our total objects Tim dot begin fill after that we can draw whatever we want and after we're done we hit end fill and it's gonna fill in the shape it just drew so when we make a circle of radius 50 and this one is new so inside circle it creates a circle of radius 50 then it's gonna end the fill and we can see what happens when I run the program now don't think you can go ahead and do turtle to Tim's square Tim triangle doesn't work like that there's only one for circle okay so let's go ahead and run the program and see what happens there we go so we get a circle and it's filled in blue pretty straightforward now I'm going to show you how we would do a square per say it's the same kind of idea but I'm showing you guys anyways so first I'm just gonna move my pen up off the screen so we're not drawing and I'm moving my turtle I'm gonna go Tim go forward 150 pixels get out of the way and Tim dot and down now I do also want to change the color so I'm gonna get Tim color and in this case let's do yellow and black like that and see how that looks and now I'm gonna go ahead and draw a square so the you can draw a square by using like Tim dot forward Tim dot right Tim go for Tim dot right and having eight lines of code or you can do the easy way by creating a for loop so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna show you guys how it works so 4x in range for Tim dot forward 100 pixels and then Tim dot right nine now this is gonna execute four times we're gonna go forward ones turn right at forward ones turn right and it's gonna end up creating a square now that's a much easier way to do it then just keep writing out forward right forward right it's just kind of a pain now I also want to fill it this in so what I'm gonna do is before I start drawing the objects I'm gonna do Tim dot begin underscore bill and then Tim dot and underscore fill just like that and now we can go ahead and run the program and see what we get there we go so again really straightforward we have the circle and then bill the screen we move to the right and then we draw the rectangle filled in now that's pretty much all the commands I'm gonna be showing you guys but stick around because what I'm gonna do now is show you how you would go about drawing random circles or random objects on the screen and it actually does use one command so I so I lied that I haven't shown you guys yet and that command is gonna be set underscore position like this okay so the way that positions work in turtle is unlike pi game if you've seen that let me just open up this window here quickly it's probably gonna crash because I didn't give it a position yep don't worry about that so right here where the circles drawn is the middle of our screen now the way it works here is if we can draw an axis here and an axis here then we can have a Cartesian kind of a plane right so here from right on if we have an imaginary line down the middle we have 0 1 2 3 4 for the X and then upwards so above this line we have 1 2 3 4 positive for the X so in this right quadrant here it's positive down here we have positive in the X and negative in the Y because we're underneath that horizontal line and I'm making with my mouse right now imaginary now if we move over into this furthest left quadrant here that means we're underneath the horizontal line or to the left of the what do you call it vertical line so we have negative for the x value so negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and negative for the Y values get negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 going downwards again last quadrant top left we have negative for the X because again from this horizontal line which the left of it and then we're positive for the Y because we're above this horizontal line it's just an Cartesian plane it's really basic and if you guys don't understand just look up Cartesian plane on Google and I'm sure you can find something that can explain it to you or you help you visualize better so when I've set positions here if I want to move to the left of the middle of the screen then I have to do something like negative 200 and then if I want to be moving downwards I would go negative 150 like so and that would put me in the bottom left quadrant of the screen so just explain that before I started using so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create the for loop I'm just going to go for X and range and this is going to be how many objects I want to draw so in this case I just want to do five and we're gonna make it really basic and I'm just gonna make a bunch of circles so what I won't need to do is I need to create two random integers so a way that we do that by importing random is we can do Rand 1 it's gonna be random dots Rand range and then I believe you can do this I'm gonna do negative 300 300 because again we need negative values so we can go to the left and down and now for rent I'm gonna do the exact same thing we're just gonna be called rant and there we go now what I'm when I set the position for my turtle I want to make sure that I have my pen up so that it doesn't draw a line while I'm moving the turtle that makes sense so I'm gonna do tim duck pen up set the position and we're just going to simply set an xcoordinate and a ycoordinate so we're gonna use R and 1 as the X and ran to as the Y now I'm not sure if this has to come in as a tuple we'll test this out but excuse me if we get an error then I'm gonna put the pen down like that I'm gonna begin a fill so to begin the fill again we do Tim dog begin underscore oops yeah underscore fill like so and then I am going to go here I'm gonna draw a circle so the way we did is certainly got his Tim dog circle and in here I'm going to do random dog Rand ring and we're gonna put zero to 80 so we can get different size circles they're not all

colors like so and then that would give us a random fill color for our circles hopefully yeah there we go and we can see we get more of a variety now as they draw on the screen all right so that's been it for this video on python turtle graphics if you have any questions or anything you'd like to address just leave a comment down below I'd be more than happy to help you guys out and if you liked the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
