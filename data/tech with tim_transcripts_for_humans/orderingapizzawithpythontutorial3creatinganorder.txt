00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the third
00:02 - video in the Python Pizza ordering
00:05 - tutorial series whatever it's gonna be
00:07 - called later on but anyways what we're
00:08 - gonna be doing in this video is
00:09 - essentially working with the menu to
00:11 - allow users to actually type in the
00:13 - codes that they see and add that to an
00:15 - order so we're gonna need to do a few
00:17 - modifications to this search menu
00:18 - function that we've created before and a
00:20 - few other things but I need to quickly
00:21 - mention the sponsor of this tutorial
00:23 - series which we've heard about before
00:24 - which is kite now guys kite is actually
00:27 - amazing I use it for all of my
00:29 - programming I know they're a sponsor and
00:30 - you guys think I'm biased but genuinely
00:32 - even one you know they're not a sponsor
00:33 - I'm using kite all of the completions
00:36 - you've seen in this tutorial series so
00:37 - far have been from kites and there will
00:39 - be a link in the description of this
00:40 - video as well as all the other videos in
00:42 - this series to download kite for free so
00:45 - take advantage of that it genuinely is a
00:47 - massive time saver and another massive
00:48 - thank you them for sponsoring this video
00:50 - alright so let's get started now and
00:53 - let's actually start by just modifying
00:54 - this search menu function after I
00:56 - explain kind of what our problem is
00:57 - right now so what this search menu does
01:00 - and I mean we've seen this if I just run
01:03 - this here is allow us us to look for
01:05 - items on the menu right so I can say you
01:06 - know let's actually try route and see if
01:08 - we get something for like root beer
01:09 - which we do there I could do coke like
01:13 - that and you can see we get some
01:14 - different items for coke but there's not
01:16 - really any way to like insert the items
01:18 - you know how do we select these items
01:20 - when we search for them on the menu so
01:21 - what I want to do is make this so rather
01:23 - than having this just constantly search
01:25 - for things it just searches for one
01:27 - thing and just prints that out for us so
01:29 - it's actually gonna be much simpler than
01:31 - what we've had right now I'm gonna get
01:32 - rid of read of this wild troop and it's
01:35 - gonna say you were now searching the
01:36 - menu will keep all of this so we'll just
01:38 - tab this back so shift tab and now what
01:41 - I'm gonna do is simply rather than
01:43 - having this break statement will keep
01:46 - that else like that but we're gonna put
01:48 - all of this inside here the reason for
01:52 - this is because since we don't have the
01:53 - break anymore we need to just put it
01:55 - inside the actual if statement so it
01:56 - only runs if we have you know a valid
01:58 - item that we've typed in otherwise we'll
02:01 - print invalid and we can exit the search
02:03 - and actually we don't necessarily even
02:05 - need to print anything you know if they
02:07 - type an item that's not valid we just
02:09 - won't get any results so maybe we can
02:11 - just type
02:12 - no results like that okay so that's good
02:17 - we'll leave that like that for now let's
02:19 - just have a look at how search menus
02:20 - gonna operate now by doing a quick test
02:22 - so now it should just ask us for it one
02:25 - so let's search for pizza like that you
02:27 - can see we get all the pizzas and then
02:29 - our program exits and let's run this one
02:31 - more time and let's just hit enter we
02:33 - can see we get no results because
02:34 - obviously you know we didn't really type
02:36 - anything valid okay so the next method
02:38 - or function that I want to write is
02:40 - going to allow us to add items to an
02:42 - order but to do that we need to create
02:44 - an order so how do we do that well if we
02:46 - look at our API we can see that to make
02:50 - an order all we need to do is use this
02:52 - line of code so order equals order begin
02:55 - customer order customer my local
02:57 - Domino's so let's copy that and let's
02:59 - paste this underneath our menu line here
03:02 - like that and let's go to the top of our
03:04 - program and import order like such now
03:08 - we actually look at order which I have
03:10 - open here and we can see all the
03:13 - different things that are associated
03:14 - with it so obviously we initialize it
03:16 - with a store a customer a country this
03:18 - isn't really actually that important but
03:20 - it's fine
03:21 - we have begin customer order add item
03:24 - remove item add coupon remove coupon
03:27 - send validate all of these different
03:29 - methods right we're not gonna dig into
03:31 - all those right now but I figured I
03:32 - would show you so we've created this
03:33 - order object now and the main method
03:35 - that we're gonna use on this order
03:36 - object is dad underscore item what this
03:41 - will allow us to do is add some item
03:43 - code and again those codes correspond to
03:46 - what we've searched here so like 16s CSP
03:49 - you know whatever that is to our order
03:52 - so we need a way to do that we need some
03:54 - function that can do that for us so what
03:56 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
03:57 - function and I'm gonna call it add to
04:00 - order and what this is gonna do is ask
04:02 - the user to essentially type in some
04:05 - different values from the you know
04:06 - search menu because they see that they
04:08 - want to add to the order so we really
04:10 - take order as a parameter and in here
04:12 - what I'm gonna do is start by printing
04:14 - say please type the codes of the items
04:20 - you'd like to order
04:23 - like that dot dot dot and now what we'll
04:27 - do is we'll say item equals input and
04:30 - we'll simply do code like that to dot
04:34 - upper because everything needs to be
04:36 - uppercase we don't want to make sure
04:37 - that we get an error if they types into
04:39 - the lower case so we'll put this in
04:40 - awhile true because we're gonna ask them
04:42 - this multiple times and what we're gonna
04:44 - do now is simply try to add whatever
04:46 - code that they have to our order so I'm
04:48 - gonna say try order dot add underscore
04:52 - item height and then we're gonna say
04:55 - accept and all we'll do in the except is
04:58 - break so if they type an invalid code I
05:01 - mean what we can do is we can print we
05:03 - can say invalid code like that dot dot
05:07 - dot but what I'll do is say if it's an
05:10 - invalid code and that invalid code is
05:13 - actually like just a space like they
05:15 - just hit enter we're gonna assume that
05:17 - they don't want to order anything else
05:18 - so what am i I'll do here is actually
05:20 - say hit enter to stop order so we'll do
05:24 - friends another line press ENTER to stop
05:30 - order dot dot like that alright we'll
05:33 - just do a period so if they if they have
05:36 - this order it doesn't work but this item
05:39 - that they typed in is like you they just
05:41 - hit enter then what we'll do is we'll
05:42 - exit this will say if item equals equals
05:46 - blank break so I'll break out of this
05:49 - wallet before us now we actually don't
05:51 - need to return anything from this
05:52 - function because all we've done is added
05:54 - these items to our order if they're
05:56 - valid and that should actually be good
05:58 - to go and now what I'm gonna do is say
05:59 - add to order we need to give it an order
06:02 - object so we'll pass it order and let's
06:04 - run this and see how this works so let's
06:06 - quit run this so it says menu and what
06:11 - is the issue we're getting here I'll
06:13 - have a look in one second I'll be right
06:14 - back alright so I've looked through the
06:16 - API here to determine what this issue
06:18 - was and I found that the issue has to do
06:20 - with the country that is defined in the
06:22 - API by default so by default the API or
06:26 - all this code assumes that we're
06:27 - ordering from the United States but
06:29 - since I am ordering from Canada I need
06:32 - to change some things to make it know
06:34 - that I am ordering from
06:35 - Canada so to do this is actually pretty
06:37 - straightforward all I need to do is do
06:39 - comma and then put CA after this order
06:42 - begin customer order in here if you're
06:45 - ordering from the US you can put us like
06:47 - this if you want to define that or you
06:49 - can just leave it blank because if we
06:51 - actually go into order and we have a
06:53 - look at begin customer order well I've
06:55 - changed this to say country Canada but
06:57 - this usually and for you will say
06:59 - country u.s. so in here it should
07:01 - actually say country u.s. which means
07:03 - that by default you're using country
07:05 - u.s. now if you're wondering where that
07:06 - variable actually comes from at the top
07:09 - here what was imported before was
07:11 - country USA and then same thing here so
07:14 - country USA was the default and then
07:16 - country USA was here as well I've just
07:18 - changed this to do some tests and if we
07:20 - look for where that was from if we go to
07:22 - the URLs library we can see that these
07:24 - are the codes that were referencing so
07:26 - us for country USA and CA for country
07:29 - Canada so I need to define inside of my
07:32 - tutorial here that I'm ordering from CA
07:34 - so that this is actually gonna work
07:36 - properly we're not gonna get some JSON
07:38 - request error so let me open up the
07:40 - command prompt and we'll run this again
07:41 - so desktop pizza CMD I'm just gonna
07:46 - activate an environment that I've been
07:48 - using and then I'm just gonna say Python
07:50 - tutorial dot pie okay so let's run this
07:53 - we say you are now searching the menu
07:55 - type an item to look for what I want to
07:57 - look for always the same example we'll
07:59 - go with coke we can see that we get all
08:01 - these codes here and that says please
08:03 - type the codes of the item you'd like to
08:04 - order so let's pick one in this case I
08:06 - want to do 500 coke like that let's add
08:10 - another item so 12c coke like that and
08:14 - then let's hit enter and we can see that
08:16 - that exits and we've you know added all
08:18 - those items to our order so now what we
08:21 - want to do though is after we've added
08:22 - items to our order we want to be able to
08:24 - search again and repeat this process and
08:27 - then at some point if you know they
08:29 - search the menu or they say they type in
08:31 - some specific input we can stop
08:33 - searching so what I'm gonna do is I'm
08:34 - gonna put a while true loop here and
08:37 - we're just gonna do both of these
08:38 - commands constantly and after we add
08:41 - items to the order I'm gonna ask the
08:42 - question inside of this while loop would
08:44 - you like to place your order now or
08:46 - continue searching and then if they say
08:48 - you know play
08:49 - order now or whatever it is but we're
08:50 - gonna ask for we will actually place the
08:53 - order which is what we'll do in the next
08:54 - video otherwise we'll keep searching so
08:56 - what I'm gonna do now is going to say
08:57 - answer equals input would you like to
09:03 - add more items question mark and then
09:06 - here we'll just put what we're looking
09:08 - for as a response so we can say y /n and
09:12 - then we'll say if answer does not equal
09:16 - or actually will say I've answered not
09:17 - in and in this case I'm just gonna put
09:20 - yes and Y and we even do answer dot
09:24 - lower here to make sure that they can
09:25 - type uppercase if they'd like to then we
09:28 - will simply break otherwise we will
09:30 - continue allow them to search the menu
09:32 - and then add some more items to their
09:33 - menu so our sorry to their order so once
09:36 - we've done all this I'd like to output
09:38 - what the order actually is so I don't
09:40 - actually know how to do that but I'm
09:42 - gonna look to see here if there's
09:44 - something to actually print it okay so
09:46 - this is what we can do we can actually
09:48 - just print the order object because if
09:50 - I'm looking inside order here we have
09:52 - this wrapper this method and what this
09:55 - will do is actually show us all the
09:57 - items that are in the order and this is
09:59 - kind of a crazy line of code that is
10:01 - gonna show that for us so let's do this
10:03 - let's just print that border object
10:06 - after so we'll say print your order is
10:11 - as follows like that and then we can see
10:15 - what they have in their order so let's
10:16 - run this one more time and see how this
10:18 - is working so would you like to look for
10:20 - an item let's look for an item I'm just
10:21 - gonna look for sauce we have these so
10:25 - I'm gonna add gar butter we can add
10:29 - marinara like that and then we'll hit
10:32 - enter would you like to add more items
10:34 - I'm gonna say no and now we say your
10:37 - order is as follows an order for 10 with
10:39 - two items in it okay so it only shows us
10:41 - the two items if we wanted to get those
10:43 - two items how would we do that well
10:45 - let's look at here so it doesn't seem
10:48 - like there is any method to actually
10:50 - show us all the items that are in our
10:52 - order let's see if there's a way that we
10:54 - can actually grab those so self data
10:57 - products so this is the Len of self data
11:00 - products so what that means is we should
11:02 - be able
11:02 - reference this actual attribute from
11:05 - inside tutorial here and print out all
11:07 - those items so what I'm actually gonna
11:09 - do is I'm gonna put a backslash n here
11:10 - just so this goes down one line and
11:12 - rather than just printing the order I'm
11:14 - actually gonna loop through all the
11:15 - items in our order and print them out so
11:16 - I'm gonna say for item in self dot R
11:22 - what am I saying self data
11:23 - this is gonna be order dot data and I
11:26 - believe this was products like that so
11:31 - let's see if that we actually have here
11:32 - so products okay
11:35 - and then what we'll do is simply print
11:38 - these out so we'll just print and here I
11:44 - okay so I'm not sure if this is gonna
11:46 - work we'll do a quick test here then we
11:47 - can always fix it after so python
11:49 - tutorial pi uh what do you like to look
11:51 - yeah let's search for coke one more time
11:54 - what we want 500 coke let's enter would
11:58 - you like to add more items no and then
12:00 - whoa okay so this is what we're printing
12:02 - out when we have all of the item in it
12:05 - Jesus okay so what do we need to do here
12:08 - if we just want to grab this code well
12:09 - we just need to reference the item like
12:12 - this and then the code so let's do this
12:15 - python tutorial pi let's look on the
12:18 - menu let's go coke let's add 500 coke
12:21 - let's hit enter say no and there's no
12:24 - code for code so let's try this with
12:26 - capital c cuz i think that's actually
12:28 - what it was so my apologies on that
12:30 - let's do this again so search for an
12:32 - item coke 500 coke enter no and there we
12:37 - go our orders as follows 500 coke okay
12:40 - so that should actually print out all
12:41 - the items that we add and at that I
12:43 - think I'm gonna leave the video here so
12:45 - there might be issues with this little
12:46 - bottom line of code yeah I'd recommend
12:48 - you guys to test this out a little bit
12:49 - before we move forward but in the next
12:50 - video I'll kind of tweak will clean some
12:52 - of this stuff up and then we'll actually
12:53 - get to you know placing this word or
12:55 - getting some credit card information and
12:57 - cleaning up some of this console stuff a
12:58 - little bit better just so this program
13:00 - is a little bit nicer to actually use so
13:02 - as always if you guys enjoyed make sure
13:03 - they but like subscribe to the channel
13:05 - and I will see you guys in the next
13:06 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to the third video in the Python Pizza ordering tutorial series whatever it's gonna be called later on but anyways what we're gonna be doing in this video is essentially working with the menu to allow users to actually type in the codes that they see and add that to an order so we're gonna need to do a few modifications to this search menu function that we've created before and a few other things but I need to quickly mention the sponsor of this tutorial series which we've heard about before which is kite now guys kite is actually amazing I use it for all of my programming I know they're a sponsor and you guys think I'm biased but genuinely even one you know they're not a sponsor I'm using kite all of the completions you've seen in this tutorial series so far have been from kites and there will be a link in the description of this video as well as all the other videos in this series to download kite for free so take advantage of that it genuinely is a massive time saver and another massive thank you them for sponsoring this video alright so let's get started now and let's actually start by just modifying this search menu function after I explain kind of what our problem is right now so what this search menu does and I mean we've seen this if I just run this here is allow us us to look for items on the menu right so I can say you know let's actually try route and see if we get something for like root beer which we do there I could do coke like that and you can see we get some different items for coke but there's not really any way to like insert the items you know how do we select these items when we search for them on the menu so what I want to do is make this so rather than having this just constantly search for things it just searches for one thing and just prints that out for us so it's actually gonna be much simpler than what we've had right now I'm gonna get rid of read of this wild troop and it's gonna say you were now searching the menu will keep all of this so we'll just tab this back so shift tab and now what I'm gonna do is simply rather than having this break statement will keep that else like that but we're gonna put all of this inside here the reason for this is because since we don't have the break anymore we need to just put it inside the actual if statement so it only runs if we have you know a valid item that we've typed in otherwise we'll print invalid and we can exit the search and actually we don't necessarily even need to print anything you know if they type an item that's not valid we just won't get any results so maybe we can just type no results like that okay so that's good we'll leave that like that for now let's just have a look at how search menus gonna operate now by doing a quick test so now it should just ask us for it one so let's search for pizza like that you can see we get all the pizzas and then our program exits and let's run this one more time and let's just hit enter we can see we get no results because obviously you know we didn't really type anything valid okay so the next method or function that I want to write is going to allow us to add items to an order but to do that we need to create an order so how do we do that well if we look at our API we can see that to make an order all we need to do is use this line of code so order equals order begin customer order customer my local Domino's so let's copy that and let's paste this underneath our menu line here like that and let's go to the top of our program and import order like such now we actually look at order which I have open here and we can see all the different things that are associated with it so obviously we initialize it with a store a customer a country this isn't really actually that important but it's fine we have begin customer order add item remove item add coupon remove coupon send validate all of these different methods right we're not gonna dig into all those right now but I figured I would show you so we've created this order object now and the main method that we're gonna use on this order object is dad underscore item what this will allow us to do is add some item code and again those codes correspond to what we've searched here so like 16s CSP you know whatever that is to our order so we need a way to do that we need some function that can do that for us so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a function and I'm gonna call it add to order and what this is gonna do is ask the user to essentially type in some different values from the you know search menu because they see that they want to add to the order so we really take order as a parameter and in here what I'm gonna do is start by printing say please type the codes of the items you'd like to order like that dot dot dot and now what we'll do is we'll say item equals input and we'll simply do code like that to dot upper because everything needs to be uppercase we don't want to

code I mean what we can do is we can print we can say invalid code like that dot dot dot but what I'll do is say if it's an invalid code and that invalid code is actually like just a space like they just hit enter we're gonna assume that they don't want to order anything else so what am i I'll do here is actually say hit enter to stop order so we'll do friends another line press ENTER to stop order dot dot like that alright we'll just do a period so if they if they have this order it doesn't work but this item that they typed in is like you they just hit enter then what we'll do is we'll exit this will say if item equals equals blank break so I'll break out of this wallet before us now we actually don't need to return anything from this function because all we've done is added these items to our order if they're valid and that should actually be good to go and now what I'm gonna do is say add to order we need to give it an order object so we'll pass it order and let's run this and see how this works so let's quit run this so it says menu and what is the issue we're getting here I'll have a look in one second I'll be right back alright so I've looked through the API here to determine what this issue was and I found that the issue has to do with the country that is defined in the API by default so by default the API or all this code assumes that we're ordering from the United States but since I am ordering from Canada I need to change some things to make it know that I am ordering from Canada so to do this is actually pretty straightforward all I need to do is do comma and then put CA after this order begin customer order in here if you're ordering from the US you can put us like this if you want to define that or you can just leave it blank because if we

country u.s. which means that by default you're using country u.s. now if you're wondering where that variable actually comes from at the top here what was imported before was country USA and then same thing here so country USA was the default and then country USA was here as well I've just changed this to do some tests and if we look for where that was from if we go to the URLs library we can see that these are the codes that were referencing so us for country USA and CA for country Canada so I need to define inside of my tutorial here that I'm ordering from CA so that this is actually gonna work properly we're not gonna get some JSON request error so let me open up the command prompt and we'll run this again so desktop pizza CMD I'm just gonna activate an environment that I've been using and then I'm just gonna say Python tutorial dot pie okay so let's run this we say you are now searching the menu type an item to look for what I want to look for always the same example we'll go with coke we can see that we get all these codes here and that says please type the codes of the item you'd like to order so let's pick one in this case I want to do 500 coke like that let's add another item so 12c coke like that and then let's hit enter and we can see that that exits and we've you know added all those items to our order so now what we want to do though is after we've added items to our order we want to be able to search again and repeat this process and then at some point if you know they search the menu or they say they type in some specific input we can stop searching so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a while true loop here and we're just gonna do both of these commands constantly and after we add items to the order I'm gonna ask the question inside of this while loop would you like to place your order now or continue searching and then if they say you know play order now or whatever it is but we're gonna ask for we will actually place the order which is what we'll do in the next video otherwise we'll keep searching so what I'm gonna do now is going to say answer equals input would you like to add more items question mark and then here we'll just put what we're looking for as a response so we can say y /n and then we'll say if answer does not equal or actually will say I've answered not in and in this case I'm just gonna put yes and Y and we even do answer dot lower here to make sure that they can type uppercase if they'd like to then we will simply break otherwise we will continue allow them to search the menu and then add some more items to their menu so our sorry to their order so once we've done all this I'd like to output what the order actually is so I don't actually know how to do that but I'm gonna look to see here if there's something to actually print it okay so this is what we can do we can actually just print the order object because if I'm looking inside order here we have this wrapper this method and what this will do is actually show us all the items that are in the order and this is kind of a crazy line of code that is gonna show that for us so let's do this let's just print that border object after so we'll say print your order is as follows like that and then we can see what they have in their order so let's run this one more time and see how this is working so would you like to look for an item let's look for an item I'm just gonna look for sauce we have these so I'm gonna add gar butter we can add marinara like that and then we'll hit enter would you like to add more items I'm gonna say no and now we say your order is as follows an order for 10 with two items in it okay so it only shows us the two items if we wanted to get those two items how would we do that well let's look at here so it doesn't seem like there is any method to actually show us all the items that are in our order let's see if there's a way that we can actually grab those so self data products so this is the Len of self data products so what that means is we should be able reference this actual attribute from inside tutorial here and print out all those items so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna put a backslash n here just so this goes down one line and rather than just printing the order I'm actually gonna loop through all the items in our order and print them out so I'm gonna say for item in self dot R what am I saying self data this is gonna be order dot data and I believe this was products like that so let's see if that we actually have here so products okay and then what we'll do is simply print these out so we'll just print and here I okay so I'm not sure if this is gonna work we'll do a quick test here then we can always fix it after so python tutorial pi uh what do you like to look yeah let's search for coke one more time what we want 500 coke let's enter would you like to add more items no and then whoa okay so this is what we're printing out when we have all of the item in it Jesus okay so what do we need to do here if we just want to grab this code well we just need to reference the item like this and then the code so let's do this python tutorial pi let's look on the menu let's go coke let's add 500 coke let's hit enter say no and there's no code for code so let's try this with capital c cuz i think that's actually what it was so my apologies on that let's do this again so search for an item coke 500 coke enter no and there we go our orders as follows 500 coke okay so that should actually print out all the items that we add and at that I think I'm gonna leave the video here so there might be issues with this little bottom line of code yeah I'd recommend you guys to test this out a little bit before we move forward but in the next video I'll kind of tweak will clean some of this stuff up and then we'll actually get to you know placing this word or getting some credit card information and cleaning up some of this console stuff a little bit better just so this program is a little bit nicer to actually use so as always if you guys enjoyed make sure they but like subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in the next video
