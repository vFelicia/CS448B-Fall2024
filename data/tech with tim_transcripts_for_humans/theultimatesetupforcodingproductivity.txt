00:00 - welcome and prepare to be amazed as I
00:02 - show you a setup that I've been building
00:04 - and iterating on for the past five years
00:06 - now this is the ultimate setup for
00:08 - programming gaming and of course content
00:11 - Creation in fact I actually have three
00:14 - setups the first setup is an M1 Mac Mini
00:16 - the second one is an absolutely Overkill
00:19 - PC and the last one is a docking station
00:22 - for my MacBook Pro now if you're
00:24 - wondering why I need three different
00:25 - setups then stick around until the end
00:27 - of the video where I talk to you about
00:28 - their use cases and show you all of the
00:30 - super high-end Tech that I'm using in
00:32 - each setup with that said let's dive
00:34 - into the two
00:36 - [Music]
00:39 - [Applause]
00:41 - [Music]
00:49 - so for any setup you need a good room
00:51 - now the room that I'm using is a spare
00:53 - bedroom in my house fortunately I own
00:55 - this house so I can do any
00:56 - customizations that I like now what I've
00:59 - done is added some custom sound proofing
01:00 - here on each of the walls as well as the
01:02 - ceiling just to give it a nice dead
01:04 - sound and make it super quiet when I'm
01:06 - recording I've also got a nice window
01:08 - here to let in some natural light and I
01:10 - have a shade on that window so I can
01:11 - pull that down and of course kind of
01:12 - make it a full blackout scene throughout
01:15 - the room I'm using different Hue Lights
01:16 - this allows me to kind of set the scene
01:18 - and set the different color profile when
01:20 - I'm doing a recording or when I'm doing
01:22 - something like gaming so now on to the
01:24 - desks obviously I have a large L desk
01:26 - which is made up of two countertops both
01:28 - that are from Ikea now I also have some
01:31 - drawers that are from Ikea this is a
01:32 - very popular setup quite a few people
01:34 - buy it and it's relatively inexpensive
01:36 - especially if you're going for a desk
01:38 - kind of the size that I have here now I
01:40 - like having a nice deep desk so that I
01:42 - can have a ton of stuff on it and I'm
01:44 - not kind of crammed or feel like my
01:45 - monitors are too close to my face now
01:47 - beyond that you can see my main setup is
01:49 - those three monitors this is where I
01:51 - spend about eighty percent of my time
01:53 - and this is connected to my Windows
01:55 - machine where I'm doing gaming editing
01:57 - programming all kinds of stuff really
01:59 - most of my work is done in this area
02:01 - then to the left of that I have my M1
02:04 - Mac Mini setup and this is solely used
02:06 - for recording audio literally all I do
02:08 - on that computer is run logic pro I have
02:11 - some filters set up in there and that's
02:12 - what records the audio that you're
02:14 - hearing right now moving on to my right
02:16 - side we have another setup this is a
02:18 - docking station for my MacBook Pro now
02:20 - the reason I need this is I do a lot of
02:22 - iOS development it's not super fast on
02:24 - the M1 Mac Mini so instead I use my
02:26 - MacBook Pro and that's where I kind of
02:28 - use xcode I'll go in and do iOS specific
02:31 - Dev connect my phone to the computer
02:33 - Etc so I just made a second setup over
02:35 - there so I have one Mac side and one
02:37 - Windows side and that is actually using
02:39 - a standing desk that can go up and down
02:40 - sometimes if I'm building computers I'll
02:42 - clear that desk off and put it on there
02:44 - I like to stand up when I'm doing all of
02:46 - those builds so next I guess I'll
02:48 - quickly mention to you my chair there so
02:49 - I am using a Herman Miller Aeron chair
02:51 - this is the classic version I got this a
02:54 - long time ago it's been holding up
02:55 - completely fine now even though this is
02:57 - an extremely expensive chair I would
02:59 - definitely recommend it to anyone who's
03:01 - sitting down for a long period of time
03:02 - it is pretty much reformed my back
03:05 - completely changed my posture and I know
03:07 - that this is a worthwhile investment so
03:09 - I think the new ones are going for
03:10 - almost fifteen hundred dollars but a
03:12 - share of this caliber is definitely
03:14 - something that you should consider
03:15 - especially if you're going to be moving
03:17 - into a software engineering career where
03:18 - you're going to be sitting 8 10 12 hours
03:20 - every single day alright so now let's
03:22 - dive into some computer specs so the
03:25 - first computer I'll start with is my
03:26 - main computer this is the one that I
03:28 - built myself now in this computer I'm
03:30 - using a ryzen 9 3900x I have 64
03:33 - gigabytes of RAM I'm using a 4090 and
03:36 - then I have dual Elgato 4K capture cards
03:39 - which actually capture the video from
03:41 - both of my professional cameras beyond
03:43 - that I have four terabytes of nvme SSD
03:46 - storage that's typically used for a
03:48 - scratch disk when I'm recording or for
03:50 - games applications
03:52 - Etc and if you're wondering where I
03:53 - store all of my videos actually have a
03:55 - home file server which I'll talk to you
03:57 - about later in this video regardless
03:59 - let's move on to my M1 Mac Mini this is
04:01 - a pretty standard configuration has the
04:03 - M1 chip I just upgraded to have 16
04:06 - gigabytes of RAM so it can handle some
04:08 - larger audio recordings and that's
04:10 - pretty much it next we have my MacBook
04:12 - Pro now this is a 16 inch MacBook Pro
04:15 - from 2019 I believe it has an i7 in it
04:17 - 16 gigs of RAM a basic GPU nothing
04:20 - insane but it is a fairly powerful
04:22 - laptop now I actually have a few other
04:24 - machines tucked away that I don't use
04:26 - too often one of them that you might
04:27 - find interesting is the Asus Rog is a
04:30 - forest Duo 15 absolutely ridiculous name
04:32 - regardless of say dual screen laptop I
04:35 - got as a part of a sponsorship that has
04:37 - a 2080 and I9 64 gigs of RAM 2 terabytes
04:41 - of storage absolutely Beast laptop but
04:43 - it has about 45 minutes of battery life
04:45 - when you're actually using all of those
04:46 - components lastly I do have an i iPad
04:49 - this iPad is what I use if I'm doing any
04:51 - kind of whiteboarding style questions or
04:53 - trying to explain something with like a
04:55 - pen and pencil alright so now that you
04:56 - know my main machines let's talk about
04:58 - how I view my main machines so my
05:00 - monitors now you may have noticed that
05:02 - every single monitor I have in this room
05:04 - is actually from BenQ now I've been
05:06 - primarily using BenQ monitors for the
05:08 - past five years or so just because I
05:10 - really prefer the colors that they have
05:12 - and the different features that are on
05:13 - the monitors however recently BenQ
05:16 - actually hooked me up with entirely new
05:18 - monitors replacing every single monitor
05:20 - I have in this office so now they are
05:22 - the official monitor company for Tech
05:24 - with Tim regardless let me go through
05:26 - the different monitors that I have it
05:28 - could be a little confusing with the
05:29 - model numbers but I'll link everything
05:30 - in the description in case you want to
05:32 - check it out yourself alright so let's
05:33 - begin with my main setup here the
05:35 - primary monitor that I have in the
05:37 - middle is the BenQ
05:39 - ex2710u which is a 27 inch 4K 144 Hertz
05:44 - display I have this because I like to
05:46 - game on my kind of main monitor so
05:48 - that's why I went with something it was
05:49 - so high end here beyond that both my
05:51 - vertical monitors are the same they are
05:53 - both 27 inches and they are the PD
05:56 - 2705u they are also 4K but they're just
05:59 - 60 hertz because I don't need a high
06:00 - refresh rate display for my secondary
06:02 - monitors now for my Mac Mini I have a PD
06:06 - 3420q this is a 34 inch 4K Ultra wide
06:09 - monitor that looks amazing now although
06:12 - I can honestly say that I do recommend
06:14 - these monitors I love them they look
06:15 - great if I didn't love them I'd swap
06:17 - them out they're definitely not budget
06:19 - friendly or a great option if you're
06:21 - just doing some basic coding these are
06:23 - really for someone like myself who's
06:24 - doing content creation gaming Etc so if
06:27 - you're someone who's just getting into
06:29 - coding then you'll probably like the
06:30 - other monitors that I have in my MacBook
06:32 - Pro setup so in that setup I'm using two
06:36 - gw2785 TC monitors again I'll link these
06:40 - in the description now I'm using the 27
06:42 - inch version of these monitors but they
06:44 - also come in 24 inches and they actually
06:46 - have a coding mode and are specifically
06:48 - designed designed for programmers now
06:50 - this mode works fantastic it makes a
06:52 - little bit easier to read your code
06:53 - gives you some better contrast and these
06:56 - monitors being 1080P and 60 hertz are a
06:58 - much more budget-friendly option and
07:00 - they also come with some of benq's
07:02 - Technology like the iCare technology now
07:04 - what this will do is automatically
07:06 - adjust the brightness of your screen
07:07 - based on the ambient lighting and this
07:10 - is something that's a little bit
07:10 - underrated and you might not notice a
07:12 - ton unless you don't have it so for me
07:14 - since I've been using BenQ monitors
07:16 - forever I'm so used to it doing this and
07:18 - it really does have a massive effect on
07:20 - the strain of your eyes when you're able
07:22 - to dynamically adjust that brightness
07:23 - without having to go in and constantly
07:25 - kind of tap on all of those features now
07:27 - the monitor comes with a ton of other
07:28 - features it has a mic it has speakers I
07:30 - don't know if you guys care about that
07:32 - obviously you can adjust it you can move
07:33 - it up and down Etc the reality is it's
07:35 - just a great entry level option for any
07:37 - of you that are looking for a secondary
07:39 - display and you can kind of do something
07:40 - like what I did here where you set up
07:42 - either vertical monitor or kind of two
07:43 - of these monitors here and connect
07:45 - something to a docking station it's just
07:47 - going to be a more pleasant experience
07:48 - when you're are working at home and not
07:50 - from some remote location alright so now
07:52 - let's move on and talk about some
07:53 - peripherals specifically my keyboard and
07:56 - mouse so for both my M1 Mac Mini and my
07:59 - main PC I use the exact same keyboard
08:01 - This is the hyperx alloy Origins with
08:03 - cherry Blue switches now these are super
08:06 - loud switches but these are the ones
08:07 - that I prefer and even though this
08:09 - keyboard isn't super high end I actually
08:11 - prefer it over a lot of the super way
08:13 - more expensive versions I think it's
08:15 - only like 100 bucks but it's been one of
08:17 - my favorite keyboards for about the past
08:18 - two years now for my Mac Pro setup I
08:21 - actually have a keychron K1 that's just
08:24 - a more compact keyboard I wanted to try
08:26 - one of those out it's not my favorite
08:27 - but it works for that setup okay so
08:30 - moving on to my mouse so all three of
08:32 - the mice that I use are Logitech MX
08:34 - Master mice I actually have two of the
08:36 - V3 ones and then one of the V1 if you're
08:39 - not sure they have like B1 B2 V3 I think
08:41 - that might be up to V4 now of this
08:43 - Logitech MX Master super popular Mouse
08:45 - it is really expensive almost the same
08:47 - price as my keyboard however definitely
08:50 - worth it and something I can highly
08:51 - recommend so continuing let's have a
08:53 - look at some different peripherals so I
08:55 - always like to listen to music when I'm
08:57 - coding or really doing any kind of work
08:59 - at all but I hate wearing headphones so
09:01 - that's why I invested in these kef LSX
09:04 - speakers which sound fantastic and
09:06 - connect to my audient ID 14 audio
09:08 - interface now this is a bit of a higher
09:10 - end audio interface that has some better
09:12 - preamps and this is what handles my mic
09:14 - input to my computer as well as routing
09:17 - the different audio between something
09:18 - like headphones if I have those plugged
09:19 - in or my speakers now this might be kind
09:22 - of a small touch or a small note here
09:24 - but I personally love having physical
09:26 - buttons on my desk for controlling the
09:28 - volume muting the mic doing a hardware
09:30 - mute not just a software mute so I do
09:32 - really appreciate having this kind of
09:34 - little control board in front of me I
09:36 - know I could go a bit crazier and get
09:37 - some more boards here but I do like
09:39 - having these kind of physical buttons
09:40 - now I have a ton of other peripherals I
09:42 - could go through but the main one I'll
09:43 - mention here is my benqe reading lamp
09:46 - now I've been talking about this for
09:47 - probably four years if you've been
09:48 - following my channel I have the same
09:50 - lamp I had back in first year university
09:52 - right now but this thing is awesome it
09:54 - goes right over top of your monitor it's
09:56 - anti-glare and what it does is provide a
09:59 - little bit of light to your eyes when
10:01 - you're actually looking at your screen
10:02 - most programmers are looking at just a
10:04 - plain screen they have no real light in
10:06 - their room other than maybe a window or
10:08 - something so having this light actually
10:10 - drastically reduces The Strain on your
10:12 - eyes I can say that from experience
10:14 - using it for a ton of years and you can
10:15 - kind of adjust the color temperature and
10:17 - the brightness of it and also if you're
10:19 - just doing something like writing or
10:20 - reading a book it's kind of nice to have
10:21 - that right over top of your setup so
10:24 - definitely recommend that if you want to
10:25 - check it out something that honestly I
10:27 - don't think I'd not have in any of my
10:29 - setups going forward alright so now
10:31 - let's get into some of the more
10:32 - expensive stuff which is my recording or
10:34 - content creation equipment so usually I
10:36 - record right here at my desk in this
10:38 - kind of scene that you're seeing right
10:40 - now and I have two cameras I have my
10:41 - main camera which is the Canon 90d and I
10:44 - have a pretty high-end Sigma lens here
10:46 - which has an F 1.8 aperture that allows
10:49 - me to get the kind of background blur
10:50 - that you're seeing and then I have a
10:52 - secondary camera which is a different
10:54 - angle I usually do shorts and stuff with
10:56 - that one and this is the Fuji xt4 this
10:59 - is a mirrorless camera again pretty high
11:01 - on camera kind of in the same line as
11:03 - the Canon 90d now both of these connect
11:05 - to capture cards in my main PC so when
11:07 - I'm recording I actually don't record on
11:09 - the camera I record from the HDMI output
11:11 - directly in OBS on my computer allowing
11:14 - me to do pretty much infinite recordings
11:16 - and not worrying about you know filling
11:18 - up SD cards and all of that now of
11:20 - course for my microphone I'm using the
11:22 - famous Shure sm7b now this is the one
11:25 - that all the YouTubers use I'm sure you
11:26 - guys know it this connects to a cloud
11:28 - lifter which gives it a bit more gain
11:30 - because these mics are very very quiet
11:32 - uh by default you need to kind of boost
11:34 - the gain up and then what I do is
11:35 - actually put this into a mic splitter
11:37 - and this splitter splits the mic signal
11:39 - to my main PC and to my Mac Mini now
11:43 - that's because the Mac Mini actually
11:44 - records the audio and then I need to
11:46 - split the audio to my main PC so I can
11:48 - use this microphone phone for like teams
11:50 - calls meetings I can record the audio if
11:52 - I'm streaming or something like that but
11:54 - the reason I go to the M1 Mac Mini is
11:56 - because the recording quality is just
11:57 - way better so I kind of need this mic
11:59 - signal in two different places which is
12:01 - why I have this more complicated kind of
12:03 - splitter setup configured now of course
12:05 - I also have some lights here I control
12:06 - all of these with a remote control and
12:09 - the way I've set everything up is that I
12:10 - can pretty much just sit down press like
12:12 - two or three different buttons and be
12:13 - ready to record not have to worry about
12:15 - doing a set setting up the light setting
12:17 - up the camera getting a tripod out I
12:19 - want to be able to just go as fast as
12:20 - possible so that's kind of how I've
12:22 - optimized my setup okay so now quickly
12:24 - I'm just gonna go through a few extra
12:25 - things in my setup that didn't really
12:27 - fit into a section so first of all
12:29 - pretty much everything you see that's
12:30 - connected to power especially if it's a
12:32 - computer is running off of a UPS which
12:35 - is an uninterruptible power supply I
12:37 - have three of them in this office and
12:39 - they all have all the computers monitors
12:41 - Etc on battery backup meaning that if
12:44 - the power goes out these are going to be
12:45 - protected and I can actually use them
12:46 - for a few minutes allowing me to kind of
12:48 - save my work or close some things up
12:50 - before I have to shut off my machine
12:52 - other than that I've actually got a 20
12:54 - terabyte home file server this is what
12:56 - allows me to work on all these different
12:58 - machines and kind of share different
12:59 - files between them super easily since
13:01 - I'm using different operating systems I
13:03 - can't just use airdrop or something like
13:05 - I would use on Mac so I actually have
13:07 - this dedicated file server that I built
13:09 - myself that stores all of my videos all
13:11 - of my audio files Etc and allows me to
13:13 - very easily transfer the files and
13:15 - access them between my different
13:16 - computers so that is my setup I could
13:18 - probably do an hour long video going
13:20 - through everything showing you the cable
13:21 - management showing you all of the
13:23 - million things that I forgot to talk
13:24 - about here but I think this was a good
13:26 - high level overview and hopefully gave
13:28 - you a little bit of inspiration for
13:29 - things maybe you can add to your setup
13:31 - or at least just entertain you a bit so
13:32 - you can go through and see kind of all
13:34 - this high-end tech gear anyways I want
13:36 - to hear what you think leave a comment
13:37 - down below and let me know what you
13:38 - thought of my setup and if you're
13:40 - curious I have a few older setup tour
13:42 - videos that you can go have a look at
13:43 - that have some different Tech and are in
13:45 - like my University dorm room it's kind
13:47 - of uh you know a blast from the past
13:48 - there want to take a look at it so I'll
13:50 - leave those on the screen here
13:52 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome and prepare to be amazed as I show you a setup that I've been building and iterating on for the past five years now this is the ultimate setup for programming gaming and of course content Creation in fact I actually have three setups the first setup is an M1 Mac Mini the second one is an absolutely Overkill PC and the last one is a docking station for my MacBook Pro now if you're wondering why I need three different setups then stick around until the end of the video where I talk to you about their use cases and show you all of the super highend Tech that I'm using in each setup with that said let's dive into the two so for any setup you need a good room now the room that I'm using is a spare bedroom in my house fortunately I own this house so I can do any customizations that I like now what I've done is added some custom sound proofing here on each of the walls as well as the ceiling just to give it a nice dead sound and make it super quiet when I'm recording I've also got a nice window here to let in some natural light and I have a shade on that window so I can pull that down and of course kind of make it a full blackout scene throughout the room I'm using different Hue Lights this allows me to kind of set the scene and set the different color profile when I'm doing a recording or when I'm doing something like gaming so now on to the desks obviously I have a large L desk which is made up of two countertops both that are from Ikea now I also have some drawers that are from Ikea this is a very popular setup quite a few people buy it and it's relatively inexpensive especially if you're going for a desk kind of the size that I have here now I like having a nice deep desk so that I can have a ton of stuff on it and I'm not kind of crammed or feel like my monitors are too close to my face now beyond that you can see my main setup is those three monitors this is where I spend about eighty percent of my time and this is connected to my Windows machine where I'm doing gaming editing programming all kinds of stuff really most of my work is done in this area then to the left of that I have my M1 Mac Mini setup and this is solely used for recording audio literally all I do on that computer is run logic pro I have some filters set up in there and that's what records the audio that you're hearing right now moving on to my right side we have another setup this is a docking station for my MacBook Pro now the reason I need this is I do a lot of iOS development it's not super fast on the M1 Mac Mini so instead I use my MacBook Pro and that's where I kind of use xcode I'll go in and do iOS specific Dev connect my phone to the computer Etc so I just made a second setup over there so I have one Mac side and one Windows side and that is actually using a standing desk that can go up and down sometimes if I'm building computers I'll clear that desk off and put it on there I like to stand up when I'm doing all of those builds so next I guess I'll quickly mention to you my chair there so I am using a Herman Miller Aeron chair this is the classic version I got this a long time ago it's been holding up completely fine now even though this is an extremely expensive chair I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's sitting down for a long period of time it is pretty much reformed my back completely changed my posture and I know that this is a worthwhile investment so I think the new ones are going for almost fifteen hundred dollars but a share of this caliber is definitely something that you should consider especially if you're going to be moving into a software engineering career where you're going to be sitting 8 10 12 hours every single day alright so now let's dive into some computer specs so the first computer I'll start with is my main computer this is the one that I built myself now in this computer I'm using a ryzen 9 3900x I have 64 gigabytes of RAM I'm using a 4090 and then I have dual Elgato 4K capture cards which actually capture the video from both of my professional cameras beyond that I have four terabytes of nvme SSD storage that's typically used for a scratch disk when I'm recording or for games applications Etc and if you're wondering where I store all of my videos actually have a home file server which I'll talk to you about later in this video regardless let's move on to my M1 Mac Mini this is a pretty standard configuration has the M1 chip I just upgraded to have 16 gigabytes of RAM so it can handle some larger audio recordings and that's pretty much it next we have my MacBook Pro now this is a 16 inch MacBook Pro from 2019 I believe it has an i7 in it 16 gigs of RAM a basic GPU nothing insane but it is a fairly powerful laptop now I actually have a few other machines tucked away that I don't use too often one of them that you might find interesting is the Asus Rog is a forest Duo 15 absolutely ridiculous name regardless of say dual screen laptop I got as a part of a sponsorship that has a 2080 and I9 64 gigs of RAM 2 terabytes of storage absolutely Beast laptop but it has about 45 minutes of battery life when you're actually using all of those components lastly I do have an i iPad this iPad is what I use if I'm doing any kind of whiteboarding style questions or trying to explain something with like a pen and pencil alright so now that you know my main machines let's talk about how I view my main machines so my monitors now you may have noticed that every single monitor I have in this room is actually from BenQ now I've been primarily using BenQ monitors for the past five years or so just because I really prefer the colors that they have and the different features that are on the monitors however recently BenQ actually hooked me up with entirely new monitors replacing every single monitor I have in this office so now they are the official monitor company for Tech with Tim regardless let me go through the different monitors that I have it could be a little confusing with the model numbers but I'll link everything in the description in case you want to check it out yourself alright so let's begin with my main setup here the primary monitor that I have in the middle is the BenQ ex2710u which is a 27 inch 4K 144 Hertz display I have this because I like to game on my kind of main monitor so that's why I went with something it was so high end here beyond that both my vertical monitors are the same they are both 27 inches and they are the PD 2705u they are also 4K but they're just 60 hertz because I don't need a high refresh rate display for my secondary monitors now for my Mac Mini I have a PD 3420q this is a 34 inch 4K Ultra wide monitor that looks amazing now although I can honestly say that I do recommend these monitors I love them they look great if I didn't love them I'd swap them out they're definitely not budget friendly or a great option if you're just doing some basic coding these are really for someone like myself who's doing content creation gaming Etc so if you're someone who's just getting into coding then you'll probably like the other monitors that I have in my MacBook Pro setup so in that setup I'm using two gw2785 TC monitors again I'll link these in the description now I'm using the 27 inch version of these monitors but they also come in 24 inches and they actually have a coding mode and are specifically designed designed for programmers now this mode works fantastic it makes a little bit easier to read your code gives you some better contrast and these monitors being 1080P and 60 hertz are a much more budgetfriendly option and they also come with some of benq's Technology like the iCare technology now what this will do is automatically adjust the brightness of your screen based on the ambient lighting and this is something that's a little bit underrated and you might not notice a ton unless you don't have it so for me since I've been using BenQ monitors forever I'm so used to it doing this and it really does have a massive effect on the strain of your eyes when you're able to dynamically adjust that brightness without having to go in and constantly kind of tap on all of those features now the monitor comes with a ton of other features it has a mic it has speakers I don't know if you guys care about that obviously you can adjust it you can move it up and down Etc the reality is it's just a great entry level option for any of you that are looking for a secondary display and you can kind of do something like what I did here where you set up either vertical monitor or kind of two of these monitors here and connect something to a docking station it's just going to be a more pleasant experience when you're are working at home and not from some remote location alright so now let's move on and talk about some peripherals specifically my keyboard and mouse so for both my M1 Mac Mini and my main PC I use the exact same keyboard This is the hyperx alloy Origins with cherry Blue switches now these are super loud switches but these are the ones that I prefer and even though this keyboard isn't super high end I actually prefer it over a lot of the super way more expensive versions I think it's only like 100 bucks but it's been one of my favorite keyboards for about the past two years now for my Mac Pro setup I actually have a keychron K1 that's just a more compact keyboard I wanted to try one of those out it's not my favorite but it works for that setup okay so moving on to my mouse so all three of the mice that I use are Logitech MX Master mice I actually have two of the V3 ones and then one of the V1 if you're not sure they have like B1 B2 V3 I think that might be up to V4 now of this Logitech MX Master super popular Mouse it is really expensive almost the same price as my keyboard however definitely worth it and something I can highly recommend so continuing let's have a look at some different peripherals so I always like to listen to music when I'm coding or really doing any kind of work at all but I hate wearing headphones so that's why I invested in these kef LSX speakers which sound fantastic and connect to my audient ID 14 audio interface now this is a bit of a higher end audio interface that has some better preamps and this is what handles my mic input to my computer as well as routing the different audio between something like headphones if I have those plugged in or my speakers now this might be kind of a small touch or a small note here but I personally love having physical buttons on my desk for controlling the volume muting the mic doing a hardware mute not just a software mute so I do really appreciate having this kind of little control board in front of me I know I could go a bit crazier and get some more boards here but I do like having these kind of physical buttons now I have a ton of other peripherals I could go through but the main one I'll mention here is my benqe reading lamp now I've been talking about this for probably four years if you've been following my channel I have the same lamp I had back in first year university right now but this thing is awesome it goes right over top of your monitor it's antiglare and what it does is provide a little bit of light to your eyes when you're actually looking at your screen most programmers are looking at just a plain screen they have no real light in their room other than maybe a window or something so having this light actually drastically reduces The Strain on your eyes I can say that from experience using it for a ton of years and you can kind of adjust the color temperature and the brightness of it and also if you're just doing something like writing or reading a book it's kind of nice to have that right over top of your setup so definitely recommend that if you want to check it out something that honestly I don't think I'd not have in any of my setups going forward alright so now let's get into some of the more expensive stuff which is my recording or content creation equipment so usually I record right here at my desk in this kind of scene that you're seeing right now and I have two cameras I have my main camera which is the Canon 90d and I have a pretty highend Sigma lens here which has an F 1.8 aperture that allows me to get the kind of background blur that you're seeing and then I have a secondary camera which is a different angle I usually do shorts and stuff with that one and this is the Fuji xt4 this is a mirrorless camera again pretty high on camera kind of in the same line as the Canon 90d now both of these connect to capture cards in my main PC so when I'm recording I actually don't record on the camera I record from the HDMI output directly in OBS on my computer allowing me to do pretty much infinite recordings and not worrying about you know filling up SD cards and all of that now of course for my microphone I'm using the famous Shure sm7b now this is the one that all the YouTubers use I'm sure you guys know it this connects to a cloud lifter which gives it a bit more gain because these mics are very very quiet uh by default you need to kind of boost the gain up and then what I do is actually put this into a mic splitter and this splitter splits the mic signal to my main PC and to my Mac Mini now that's because the Mac Mini actually records the audio and then I need to split the audio to my main PC so I can use this microphone phone for like teams calls meetings I can record the audio if I'm streaming or something like that but the reason I go to the M1 Mac Mini is because the recording quality is just way better so I kind of need this mic signal in two different places which is why I have this more complicated kind of splitter setup configured now of course I also have some lights here I control all of these with a remote control and the way I've set everything up is that I can pretty much just sit down press like two or three different buttons and be ready to record not have to worry about doing a set setting up the light setting up the camera getting a tripod out I want to be able to just go as fast as possible so that's kind of how I've optimized my setup okay so now quickly I'm just gonna go through a few extra things in my setup that didn't really fit into a section so first of all pretty much everything you see that's connected to power especially if it's a computer is running off of a UPS which is an uninterruptible power supply I have three of them in this office and they all have all the computers monitors Etc on battery backup meaning that if the power goes out these are going to be protected and I can actually use them for a few minutes allowing me to kind of save my work or close some things up before I have to shut off my machine other than that I've actually got a 20 terabyte home file server this is what allows me to work on all these different machines and kind of share different files between them super easily since I'm using different operating systems I can't just use airdrop or something like I would use on Mac so I actually have this dedicated file server that I built myself that stores all of my videos all of my audio files Etc and allows me to very easily transfer the files and access them between my different computers so that is my setup I could probably do an hour long video going through everything showing you the cable management showing you all of the million things that I forgot to talk about here but I think this was a good high level overview and hopefully gave you a little bit of inspiration for things maybe you can add to your setup or at least just entertain you a bit so you can go through and see kind of all this highend tech gear anyways I want to hear what you think leave a comment down below and let me know what you thought of my setup and if you're curious I have a few older setup tour videos that you can go have a look at that have some different Tech and are in like my University dorm room it's kind of uh you know a blast from the past there want to take a look at it so I'll leave those on the screen here foreign
