00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new tutorial series
00:03 - on linux 4 programmers now this series
00:07 - is going to aim to make you comfortable
00:09 - using a linux device and teach you the
00:11 - things that you need to know
00:12 - as a programmer about the linux
00:14 - operating system
00:15 - now specifically we're going to be
00:16 - focusing on common linux commands we're
00:19 - also going to be talking about
00:20 - networking
00:20 - ssh we're going to be talking about
00:22 - users and permissions
00:24 - the basic linux text editors that you
00:26 - need to know and then a few more
00:27 - advanced things like cron jobs
00:29 - shell scripts and how you can actually
00:31 - connect a domain with a virtual
00:33 - server now these are all good things to
00:35 - know and as a programmer you do need to
00:38 - have a lot of these skills in fact at
00:40 - many job interviews you will get asked
00:42 - are you comfortable using linux do you
00:44 - know these different linux distributions
00:46 - and depending on your answer to that
00:48 - question you may or may not be getting a
00:50 - job
00:51 - linux is just something that you really
00:53 - should be comfortable with as a
00:54 - programmer
00:55 - and even though you're not going to be
00:56 - using it every single day it's very
00:58 - important that if you do need to work on
01:00 - a linux machine you know how to do so
01:02 - so with that said let's get started in
01:04 - this tutorial series
01:05 - in this first video we're going to be
01:07 - learning how to set up a virtual linux
01:09 - machine
01:09 - and then how to ssh into it
01:14 - [Music]
01:20 - so as i mentioned the first step in this
01:22 - series is to get access to a linux
01:24 - device so you can follow along with the
01:26 - rest of the videos
01:27 - now if you have your own linux device at
01:28 - home that is great but if you don't we
01:31 - have a solution for you and that is
01:33 - lenode now lenode is actually the
01:35 - sponsor of this video
01:36 - and this series and they were kind
01:38 - enough to provide all of you with a free
01:39 - a hundred dollar
01:41 - credit towards your first lenode servers
01:43 - so if you want to get started using
01:45 - lenode go to the link in the description
01:47 - it should bring you to a page that looks
01:49 - like this
01:50 - and what you need to do is press this
01:51 - create free account button
01:53 - and it will redirect you to a page to
01:55 - create a brand new lenode account where
01:57 - your 100
01:58 - credit will automatically be applied now
02:00 - lenode is a server hosting company they
02:02 - also have a bunch of other things as
02:03 - well which i'll talk about later
02:05 - but they're awesome i've been using them
02:07 - for over two years i host
02:09 - websites on lenode i have servers that i
02:11 - use for databases i actually have one of
02:13 - my main domains hosted on lenode
02:15 - so definitely super reliable i trust
02:17 - them and i've been a long time customer
02:19 - and that's why i'm happy to have them
02:20 - sponsoring this video and this series
02:23 - now the last thing that i need to say
02:24 - about lenode is that they're actually
02:26 - going to be providing early access to
02:28 - the later videos in this series
02:30 - so almost all of these videos will be
02:32 - posted on youtube on a regular upload
02:34 - schedule
02:35 - but the last five videos will be on
02:37 - lenode's platform
02:38 - and if you want to get access to them
02:40 - immediately so as soon as i finish
02:42 - filming and editing them
02:43 - then you do need to sign up at this
02:44 - webpage right here they will be posted
02:47 - to youtube
02:47 - at a later date but i don't know that
02:49 - exact date right now
02:50 - so if you want to make sure you have
02:52 - these immediately as soon as they are
02:54 - finished
02:54 - then sign up at this page the link will
02:56 - be in the description
02:57 - and these are the specific videos so
02:59 - shell scripts cron jobs advanced
03:01 - commands deploying a simple python web
03:03 - server
03:04 - and registering a domain on lenode and
03:06 - we're going to be connecting that domain
03:07 - with the web server
03:09 - anyways let's move on now and boot up
03:10 - our first server
03:12 - so at this point in time i'm going to
03:13 - assume that your account is set up and
03:15 - ready to go
03:16 - if it's not pause the video and come
03:18 - back afterwards
03:19 - anyways now that we're here on the note
03:21 - i'll just quickly walk you through the
03:22 - platform
03:23 - so to create a brand new node you can
03:25 - press this create button here you can
03:27 - also create a bunch of other things like
03:28 - volumes
03:29 - node balancers you can deal with domains
03:31 - on the node in fact i actually host one
03:33 - of my domains on the node
03:35 - as well as two of my servers that i use
03:38 - related to my discord server which you
03:39 - guys should definitely join from the
03:40 - link in the description
03:42 - anyways lenode also has strong
03:44 - integration and support for kubernetes
03:46 - and pretty much anything that you need
03:47 - as a developer you can access
03:49 - here on lenove now let's get started by
03:52 - creating our first server you can see i
03:54 - have two right here but to create one
03:56 - we're going to press the create a
03:57 - node button or create at the top left
04:00 - and then press
04:01 - the node now from here we need to select
04:03 - a few things so the distribution of our
04:05 - lenod
04:06 - the region root password and all of that
04:08 - now for this tutorial series i'm going
04:10 - to be using ubuntu as my distribution
04:13 - so i'm going to pick ubuntu 20.10 i
04:16 - would recommend that you all use ubuntu
04:18 - as well
04:18 - and the rationale behind this is that
04:20 - ubuntu is one of the most common linux
04:22 - distributions
04:23 - a lot of the other linux distributions
04:24 - are fairly similar so a bunch of the
04:26 - stuff that i teach here
04:28 - will actually apply to other linux
04:29 - distributions as well
04:31 - of course there's differences between
04:32 - them but ubuntu is what i'm most
04:34 - comfortable with and familiar with and i
04:36 - figured that's what we should use
04:37 - for this series anyways after we pick
04:39 - our image we can go to
04:41 - our region so i'm going to select
04:43 - toronto ontario
04:44 - and then we can choose our lenode plan
04:47 - so you can see that the cheapest lenod
04:48 - plan and this is really all that we need
04:50 - for this series
04:51 - is five dollars a month and is the
04:53 - nanoed one
04:54 - gigabyte with 25 gigabytes of storage
04:57 - personally i'm gonna go with the node
04:59 - four gigabyte just because i want
05:00 - something that's a little bit faster but
05:02 - you're welcome to pick whatever you like
05:04 - and you can also see that they have
05:05 - dedicated cpu options high memory
05:08 - options and gpu options as well though
05:10 - just not in this region
05:12 - so let's stick with the node 4 gigabyte
05:14 - and then
05:15 - let's give a label to our lenove so i'm
05:17 - just going to call this one tutorial but
05:19 - i'd highly recommend you call this
05:20 - something that's meaningful to you
05:22 - because when you have a lot of the nodes
05:24 - it's hard to keep track of which one is
05:25 - which
05:26 - lastly we need to enter our root
05:28 - password so i'm going to go ahead and do
05:30 - that right now
05:31 - all right so i've entered my password
05:32 - and we're actually ready to go and
05:34 - create our first lynn node
05:35 - now before i do that i will mention that
05:37 - there's some add-ons like you can add
05:39 - backups each month and a private ip
05:41 - address
05:42 - you also if you wanted a node that's for
05:44 - a specific purpose so you wanted it
05:46 - say for like mongodb you're a minecraft
05:48 - server or something like that
05:49 - could click on the marketplace and
05:51 - within the marketplace there's actually
05:52 - a bunch of options for kind of pre-built
05:54 - lenods or pre-configured servers
05:57 - and you can press on this and then
05:58 - that's actually going to kind of do a
06:00 - lot of the necessary setup for you for
06:02 - whatever the application is that you're
06:04 - running
06:05 - anyways i just need to go back and
06:06 - reselect my distribution because we're
06:08 - not going to choose any of those
06:09 - marketplace apps but it's really
06:10 - interesting and definitely makes it much
06:12 - faster to set something up
06:14 - so i guess i'm going to have to go back
06:15 - through and redo a bit of this yes i
06:18 - need to re-enter my password
06:20 - but that's fine now we are ready to go
06:23 - so i'm going to go ahead and press
06:24 - create and this will just take one
06:26 - second and then our la node will be
06:28 - booted up and i will be
06:29 - right back all right so our lenode is
06:31 - now running you can see that because we
06:34 - see
06:34 - the running icon right here before it
06:36 - was showing booting and it was kind of a
06:38 - little yellow icon
06:39 - now quickly if you want to power off or
06:41 - reboot your lenode you can press the
06:43 - buttons right here
06:44 - we don't really need to mess around with
06:45 - anything more on this page though
06:47 - all we need to do is keep track of this
06:49 - ip address right here so find your
06:51 - lenods ip address it should just be
06:53 - under ip addresses you're going to want
06:55 - the one that's shorter
06:56 - yours will probably look a little bit
06:57 - different than this but copy it to your
07:00 - clipboard and also make sure you
07:01 - remember your root password because
07:03 - that's what we're going to need
07:04 - next so now that we have this ip address
07:06 - we actually need to ssh into this server
07:09 - and start doing something on it start
07:11 - working on the server so now before we
07:13 - move any further i do need to quickly
07:14 - thank the other sponsor of this series
07:17 - which is algo
07:18 - expert algo expert is the best platform
07:20 - to use when preparing for your software
07:22 - engineering coding interviews
07:23 - i actually work there as an instructor
07:25 - on the platform and i can highly
07:27 - recommend it as many high quality coding
07:29 - interview practice questions
07:30 - so get started using algo expert today
07:32 - by hitting the link in the description
07:34 - and using the code tech with tim for a
07:36 - discount on the platform
07:37 - so what i'm going to do now is i'm going
07:39 - to show you how to ssh into your machine
07:41 - on mac and then i will show you how to
07:42 - do so on windows
07:44 - so on mac it's really straightforward
07:45 - you don't need to download anything
07:47 - you simply need to open up your terminal
07:49 - you can do that by going to the
07:50 - spotlight search and searching for
07:52 - terminal
07:53 - then go inside of your terminal and
07:54 - simply type ssh
07:56 - then root at and then the ip address of
07:59 - your server
08:00 - after you do that simply press enter it
08:02 - will likely prompt you with some
08:04 - question that says yes slash no as the
08:06 - potential answer
08:08 - just type yes in there and press enter
08:10 - and then it should show you a password
08:12 - field
08:13 - here at the password field simply type
08:15 - in the password for your server so what
08:17 - you set up when you were on
08:18 - lenode so the root password it's not
08:20 - going to actually show you any
08:21 - characters are being typed in but it is
08:23 - working so just type it in and then
08:25 - press
08:25 - enter and then you are good to go you
08:27 - can now skip through the windows section
08:30 - but i will show you now how to ssh into
08:32 - your machine on windows
08:34 - if you do not have a mac so go to this
08:37 - website right here i'm going to leave a
08:38 - link in the description but it's simply
08:40 - putty.org
08:41 - and download this tool this is simply an
08:44 - ssh
08:44 - client and it just allows us to actually
08:46 - ssh into our server
08:48 - it makes it really easy to store all of
08:50 - the ssh credentials and information and
08:52 - all of that
08:52 - so once you've downloaded putty what you
08:54 - need to do is open that up so you can do
08:56 - that from the windows bar down here and
08:58 - you should see an application that looks
09:00 - something
09:01 - like this what we're going to do is
09:03 - we're going to paste our ip address
09:04 - right into the host name or ip address
09:07 - field
09:08 - and then i'm going to show you a few
09:09 - more things to configure our putty
09:11 - session
09:11 - so first of all the port number of 22 is
09:14 - fine you can leave it like that
09:15 - you want the connection type to be ssh
09:18 - and then
09:18 - close window on exit you're welcome to
09:21 - select what you want here but i'm going
09:22 - to leave it only on
09:23 - clean exit next what i'm going to do is
09:25 - just make the font size
09:27 - of my putty window or ssh client or
09:30 - console or whatever you want to call it
09:31 - a little bit larger
09:32 - so i'm going to go to the window thing
09:33 - here i'm going to go to appearance
09:35 - i'm going to go here where it says
09:36 - change and i'm going to change the font
09:38 - to just be
09:38 - size 24 just so that you guys can read
09:41 - this because it's a little bit small
09:42 - otherwise
09:43 - you also can change the colors and all
09:45 - of that from this page but
09:46 - we don't need to do that anyways let's
09:48 - go back to session you can see that we
09:50 - still have the ip address in
09:52 - and now what we're going to do is just
09:53 - save the settings that we just put in so
09:55 - anything that we do or anything that
09:57 - we're changing
09:57 - kind of in this putty client it's
09:59 - usually a good idea just to save it so
10:00 - we don't have to do this again
10:02 - so what we're going to do is insert a
10:03 - name where it says saved sessions
10:05 - i'm just going to call this tutorial and
10:08 - then you can go ahead and press
10:09 - save and that will save all of this
10:11 - information so just to show you how this
10:13 - works
10:13 - if i delete this ip address here and
10:15 - then i press on tutorial
10:17 - and i double press it i didn't actually
10:19 - mean to double press it let me close
10:21 - this and show you again here
10:22 - all right so i just had to reopen putty
10:24 - i don't know i accidentally double
10:25 - pressed it didn't mean to but if you
10:27 - press it
10:27 - and then you press load then you see
10:29 - that it actually loads the name it loads
10:31 - the ip
10:32 - address and if i were to go back to
10:33 - appearance here you can see the 24
10:35 - point font is still saved so anyways
10:38 - this is how you save a session i usually
10:39 - recommend you to save them and then you
10:40 - can easily load it after
10:42 - anyways once you have the ip address in
10:44 - this field and you've changed all the
10:45 - settings that you want
10:46 - go ahead and press open or as you saw
10:48 - double click on the tutorial thing there
10:51 - and then this will open up a little
10:52 - window so when you're prompted with a
10:54 - little window that looks something like
10:55 - this just go ahead and press yes there's
10:57 - no worries with this
10:58 - and then you should be good and you
11:00 - should see something that says log
11:02 - in as now i'm just going to make this
11:04 - full screen so that it's easier to see
11:06 - but when it says login as you're going
11:08 - to log in as the root user it's going to
11:10 - say
11:11 - root like that and then it's going to
11:12 - ask you for the password
11:14 - now the password is whatever you put in
11:16 - when you actually set up this land so in
11:18 - that root password field
11:20 - so i'm just going to type mine in you're
11:21 - going to notice that you don't actually
11:22 - see anything popping up but it is indeed
11:25 - being typed in
11:26 - and then once you've typed in the
11:27 - password press enter
11:29 - now assuming this password is correct
11:31 - you should get a screen that looks
11:32 - something like this
11:33 - and now you can see information about
11:35 - your lenode
11:36 - so at this point in time if you've
11:38 - successfully logged into your lenode
11:41 - you have completed this first tutorial
11:43 - series there's one last thing that we
11:45 - can do that's usually a good idea which
11:46 - is just to update the software on our
11:48 - lenode
11:48 - but after we do that that's going to
11:50 - conclude video one and then in video two
11:52 - we'll move on and talk about some basic
11:54 - linux commands you need to know so
11:56 - anyways to end here we're going to
11:57 - update the software on our lenode by
11:59 - typing sudo
12:00 - apt update like that and this will just
12:03 - run through and update all of the
12:04 - necessary packages and then the last
12:06 - thing we're going to do after we update
12:07 - is we are going to upgrade so we're
12:09 - going to say sudo
12:10 - apt hyphen up and then grade
12:13 - like that then this will upgrade all of
12:15 - the packages that we need if you're
12:17 - prompted with something that says
12:18 - do you want to use this much extra space
12:20 - just go ahead and type yes
12:22 - it may prompt you that multiple times
12:24 - after you type yes
12:25 - press enter and then you should be good
12:27 - to go so anyways
12:29 - now that our server is updated and
12:31 - upgraded we are ready to continue with
12:33 - this series
12:34 - so i hope you enjoyed if you did make
12:36 - sure to leave a like and subscribe and i
12:37 - will see you
12:38 - in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on linux 4 programmers now this series is going to aim to make you comfortable using a linux device and teach you the things that you need to know as a programmer about the linux operating system now specifically we're going to be focusing on common linux commands we're also going to be talking about networking ssh we're going to be talking about users and permissions the basic linux text editors that you need to know and then a few more advanced things like cron jobs shell scripts and how you can actually connect a domain with a virtual server now these are all good things to know and as a programmer you do need to have a lot of these skills in fact at many job interviews you will get asked are you comfortable using linux do you know these different linux distributions and depending on your answer to that question you may or may not be getting a job linux is just something that you really should be comfortable with as a programmer and even though you're not going to be using it every single day it's very important that if you do need to work on a linux machine you know how to do so so with that said let's get started in this tutorial series in this first video we're going to be learning how to set up a virtual linux machine and then how to ssh into it so as i mentioned the first step in this series is to get access to a linux device so you can follow along with the rest of the videos now if you have your own linux device at home that is great but if you don't we have a solution for you and that is lenode now lenode is actually the sponsor of this video and this series and they were kind enough to provide all of you with a free a hundred dollar credit towards your first lenode servers so if you want to get started using lenode go to the link in the description it should bring you to a page that looks like this and what you need to do is press this create free account button and it will redirect you to a page to create a brand new lenode account where your 100 credit will automatically be applied now lenode is a server hosting company they also have a bunch of other things as well which i'll talk about later but they're awesome i've been using them for over two years i host websites on lenode i have servers that i use for databases i actually have one of my main domains hosted on lenode so definitely super reliable i trust them and i've been a long time customer and that's why i'm happy to have them sponsoring this video and this series now the last thing that i need to say about lenode is that they're actually going to be providing early access to the later videos in this series so almost all of these videos will be posted on youtube on a regular upload schedule but the last five videos will be on lenode's platform and if you want to get access to them immediately so as soon as i finish filming and editing them then you do need to sign up at this webpage right here they will be posted to youtube at a later date but i don't know that exact date right now so if you want to make sure you have these immediately as soon as they are finished then sign up at this page the link

you need as a developer you can access here on lenove now let's get started by creating our first server you can see i have two right here but to create one we're going to press the create a node button or create at the top left and then press the node now from here we need to select a few things so the distribution of our lenod the region root password and all of that now for this tutorial series i'm going to be using ubuntu as my distribution so i'm going to pick ubuntu 20.10 i would recommend that you all use ubuntu as well and the rationale behind this is that ubuntu is one of the most common linux distributions a lot of the other linux distributions are fairly similar so a bunch of the stuff that i teach here will actually apply to other linux distributions as well of course there's differences between them but ubuntu is what i'm most comfortable with and familiar with and i figured that's what we should use for this series anyways after we pick our image we can go to our region so i'm going to select toronto ontario and then we can choose our lenode plan so you can see that the cheapest lenod plan and this is really all that we need for this series is five dollars a month and is the nanoed one gigabyte with 25 gigabytes of storage personally i'm gonna go with the node four gigabyte just because i want something that's a little bit faster but you're welcome to pick whatever you like and you can also see that they have dedicated cpu options high memory options and gpu options as well though just not in this region so let's stick with the node 4 gigabyte and then let's give a label to our lenove so i'm just going to call this one tutorial but i'd highly recommend you call this something that's meaningful to you because when you have a lot of the nodes it's hard to keep track of which one is which lastly we need to enter our root password so i'm going to go ahead and do that right now all right so i've entered my password and we're actually ready to go and create our first lynn node now before i do that i will mention that there's some addons like you can add backups each month and a private ip address you also if you wanted a node that's for a specific purpose so you wanted it say for like mongodb you're a minecraft server or something like that could click on the marketplace and within the marketplace there's actually a bunch of options for kind of prebuilt lenods or preconfigured servers and you can press on this and then that's actually going to kind of do a lot of the necessary setup for you for whatever the application is that you're running anyways i just need to go back and reselect my distribution because we're not going to choose any of those marketplace apps but it's really interesting and definitely makes it much faster to set something up so i guess i'm going to have to go back through and redo a bit of this yes i need to reenter my password but that's fine now we are ready to go so i'm going to go ahead and press create and this will just take one second and then our la node will be booted up and i will be right back all right so our lenode is now running you can see that because we see the running icon right here before it was showing booting and it was kind of a little yellow icon now quickly if you want to power off or reboot your lenode you can press the buttons right here we don't really need to mess around with anything more on this page though all we need to do is keep track of this ip address right here so find your lenods ip address it should just be under ip addresses you're going to want the one that's shorter yours will probably look a little bit different than this but copy it to your clipboard and also make sure you remember your root password because that's what we're going to need next so now that we have this ip address we actually need to ssh into this server and start doing something on it start working on the server so now before we move any further i do need to quickly thank the other sponsor of this series which is algo expert algo expert is the best platform to use when preparing for your software engineering coding interviews i actually work there as an instructor on the platform and i can highly recommend it as many high quality coding interview practice questions so get started using algo expert today by hitting the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to show you how to ssh into your machine on mac and then i will show you how to do so on windows so on mac it's really straightforward you don't need to download anything you simply need to open up your terminal you can do that by going to the spotlight search and searching for terminal then go inside of your terminal and simply type ssh then root at and then the ip address of your server after you do that simply press enter it will likely prompt you with some question that says yes slash no as the potential answer just type yes in there and press enter and then it should show you a password field here at the password field simply type in the password for your server so what you set up when you were on lenode so the root password it's not going to actually show you any characters are being typed in but it is working so just type it in and then press enter and then you are good to go you can now skip through the windows section but i will show you now how to ssh into your machine on windows if you do not have a mac so go to this website right here i'm going to leave a link in the description but it's simply putty.org and download this tool this is simply an ssh client and it just allows us to actually ssh into our server it makes it really easy to store all of the ssh credentials and information and all of that so once you've downloaded putty what you need to do is open that up so you can do that from the windows bar down here and you should see an application that looks something like this what we're going to do is we're going to paste our ip address right into the host name or ip address field and then i'm going to show you a few more things to configure our putty session so first of all the port number of 22 is fine you can leave it like that you want the connection type to be ssh and then close window on exit you're welcome to select what you want here but i'm going to leave it only on clean exit next what i'm going to do is just make the font size of my putty window or ssh client or console or whatever you want to call it a little bit larger so i'm going to go to the window thing here i'm going to go to appearance i'm going to go here where it says change and i'm going to change the font to just be size 24 just so that you guys can read this because it's a little bit small otherwise you also can change the colors and all of that from this page but we don't need to do that anyways let's go back to session you can see that we still have the ip address in and now what we're going to do is just save the settings that we just put in so anything that we do or anything that we're changing kind of in this putty client it's usually a good idea just to save it so we don't have to do this again so what we're going to do is insert a name where it says saved sessions i'm just going to call this tutorial and then you can go ahead and press save and that will save all of this information so just to show you how this works if i delete this ip address here and then i press on tutorial and i double press it i didn't actually mean to double press it let me close this and show you again here all right so i just had to reopen putty i don't know i accidentally double pressed it didn't mean to but if you press it and then you press load then you see that it actually loads the name it loads the ip address and if i were to go back to appearance here you can see the 24 point font is still saved so anyways this is how you save a session i usually recommend you to save them and then you can easily load it after anyways once you have the ip address in this field and you've changed all the settings that you want go ahead and press open or as you saw double click on the tutorial thing there and then this will open up a little window so when you're prompted with a little window that looks something like this just go ahead and press yes there's no worries with this and then you should be good and you should see something that says log in as now i'm just going to make this full screen so that it's easier to see but when it says login as you're going to log in as the root user it's going to say root like that and then it's going to ask you for the password now the password is whatever you put in when you actually set up this land so in that root password field so i'm just going to type mine in you're going to notice that you don't actually see anything popping up but it is indeed being typed in and then once you've typed in the password press enter now assuming this password is correct you should get a screen that looks something like this and now you can see information about your lenode so at this point in time if you've successfully logged into your lenode you have completed this first tutorial series there's one last thing that we can do that's usually a good idea which is just to update the software on our lenode but after we do that that's going to conclude video one and then in video two we'll move on and talk about some basic linux commands you need to know so anyways to end here we're going to update the software on our lenode by typing sudo apt update like that and this will just run through and update all of the necessary packages and then the last thing we're going to do after we update is we are going to upgrade so we're going to say sudo apt hyphen up and then grade like that then this will upgrade all of the packages that we need if you're prompted with something that says do you want to use this much extra space just go ahead and type yes it may prompt you that multiple times after you type yes press enter and then you should be good to go so anyways now that our server is updated and upgraded we are ready to continue with this series so i hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like and subscribe and i will see you in the next video
