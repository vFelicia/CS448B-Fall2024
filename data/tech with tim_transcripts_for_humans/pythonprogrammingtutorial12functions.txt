00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:03 - this is the 12th video in my Python
00:05 - Programming series and today we're going
00:07 - to be talking about functions so this is
00:10 - a function up here um we're going to
00:13 - talk more about the syntax and what a
00:15 - function does but it's first important
00:17 - to understand what is a function well if
00:20 - you're in math you know that a function
00:23 - pretty much you pass it an x value and
00:25 - then it does something to that x value
00:26 - and you get a y value back well it's a
00:29 - similar idea here in Python except
00:31 - there's different types of functions
00:32 - that can do different things so the
00:35 - first function I've just written right
00:36 - here um pretty much I've named it add
00:39 - two and what happens is we give it an x
00:41 - value and then it simply returns x + 2
00:45 - now this doesn't have to make sense to
00:47 - you right now I just want to show an
00:48 - example of what a function looks like so
00:50 - if we wanted to make our own function
00:53 - what we would type is we type DF this is
00:55 - stands for definition um and then the
00:58 - function name so maybe in this case I
01:00 - want to do another math related function
01:02 - so I'll do
01:03 - subtract two and oops two as a word and
01:08 - then I'm going to put two brackets and
01:10 - inside of the brackets we're going to
01:11 - put something that's called a parameter
01:14 - so in this case I can name it anything I
01:15 - want I'm going to put number in here and
01:18 - then I'm going to do a colon click enter
01:21 - it should tab me in one space and I'm
01:23 - simply going to return X or sorry number
01:28 - minus 2
01:31 - now I'm I'll talk about what all this
01:32 - really does um a little bit later but I
01:34 - just want to give some examples so now
01:36 - if we want to call our function or we
01:38 - want to actually use these functions we
01:41 - have to do something we can't just leave
01:43 - it like this I'll show you if I run this
01:44 - right now nothing's going to happen what
01:47 - we actually have to do is we have to do
01:48 - a um call statement so what I can do is
01:51 - I can do add
01:53 - to and then in here we have a parameter
01:58 - X but what's actually going to happen is
02:00 - I have to give add to a number because
02:03 - we're going to add two to that number
02:05 - and it's going to be returned so let's
02:07 - say
02:08 - 7 now you'll see what's going to happen
02:11 - here uh I'll run it quickly and nothing
02:14 - prints out to the screen that's simply
02:17 - because we haven't printed anything what
02:19 - actually happens is in this add to call
02:21 - statement we have it sets x equal to 7
02:24 - so it comes up here and it says okay
02:26 - we're going to add two to 7 so we have X
02:28 - here we add to and then we're going to
02:31 - return that back down here so pretty
02:34 - much we call this function and it
02:36 - returns it right here now I have to set
02:38 - this equal to a variable or simply print
02:41 - it out to the screen so I'll set it
02:42 - equal to a variable right now so I'll
02:44 - say new number is equal to add to 7 and
02:48 - now if I print
02:50 - out new number like this we get nine
02:56 - okay so that that's how that works all
02:58 - right now what about subtract two so we
03:01 - can do the same thing here with seven so
03:02 - we do subtract two we'll leave seven in
03:06 - here for
03:08 - number and you'll see we get five so
03:11 - that works correctly now I can do it
03:14 - again I could do
03:15 - 12 and we get 10 and maybe I could even
03:19 - change what I want to do in these
03:20 - functions so this one's called add two
03:23 - but maybe I wanted to add two to X and
03:27 - then I wanted to square it so then I
03:30 - would do that and then if we go back to
03:32 - the add two so I'm going to put 12 + 2^
03:35 - 2 which would be 14 s which will be a
03:37 - pretty big number which will give us 196
03:40 - just like that so you can kind of see um
03:43 - and understand how these functions are
03:45 - working they have a parameter this is
03:47 - what that's called up here so a variable
03:49 - name I could do X I could do y I could
03:52 - do Zed doesn't matter I can do any
03:54 - letter I want any name I want um it
03:56 - makes sense to call it something that
03:58 - makes sense in terms of the function so
04:00 - here x works fine but if I was doing a
04:02 - string so maybe we want to write another
04:04 - function let's let's do another function
04:06 - here and we'll do Define and we'll call
04:09 - we'll say
04:10 - print
04:12 - string and now inside of here I'm just
04:14 - going to put string like that as our
04:18 - parameter name and then we're simply
04:19 - just going to print the string to the
04:22 - screen so now what actually happens is
04:25 - instead of setting something equal to a
04:27 - variable all I have to do is I have to
04:29 - do
04:30 - print string this is my call statement
04:32 - and then in here I'm going to give it a
04:33 - string so I'm just going to type
04:36 - hello and you'll see if we run the
04:38 - function we get hello and we didn't
04:41 - print it down here we just printed it
04:43 - from the function so I know I've gone
04:46 - kind of fast but the easiest way to
04:48 - understand the functions are to show
04:49 - examples of them and how they're working
04:51 - pretty much there's a
04:53 - parameter I'm going to give the
04:55 - parameter I'm in the argument of the
04:57 - call statement so this in the definition
05:00 - of the function is called a parameter
05:03 - and in the call statement in between the
05:06 - brackets it's called an
05:08 - argument um so those are just some key
05:10 - words now I can actually use these
05:12 - functions as many times as I want so I
05:14 - can print string again and I could
05:16 - print my name is Tim just like that and
05:19 - you'll see it should do it twice yeah
05:21 - there we go so that's why these
05:23 - functions are extremely useful because
05:26 - say for example I'm wrting a big program
05:28 - and I know that I would need to do a
05:30 - certain thing multiple times well I
05:32 - don't want to have to constantly write
05:34 - it out um in the main line of my program
05:37 - here when I can just have a function
05:39 - that's going to do it for me and all I
05:40 - have to do is call that function using a
05:42 - simple call statement like this so we
05:45 - haven't really done many big programs
05:46 - yet where functions make sense but
05:48 - you'll see when you start programming
05:50 - that you're going to be using a lot of
05:51 - functions um to do things because you're
05:53 - going to be repeating code um now these
05:55 - are very basic functions we have
05:57 - subtract two add two but you can have
06:00 - like physics functions for example if I
06:02 - know I'm need to find the uh
06:05 - acceleration of an object then maybe I
06:07 - would make another function here and I
06:08 - do
06:09 - Define excel I'll just do like that uh
06:13 - short form and then I'll put in mass and
06:16 - the force like that so you see I can
06:19 - actually have more than one um parameter
06:22 - I can have two parameters here and I'm
06:23 - going to say a is equal
06:27 - to mass * Force I know that's not
06:30 - correct but we could do something like
06:31 - that mass time
06:33 - force and then I could return the
06:36 - variable a and now if I called my Excel
06:40 - function and I printed that to the
06:41 - screen well that would give me what the
06:43 - acceleration would be right um so that
06:46 - those are just some examples of why
06:47 - functions are extremely useful well
06:49 - we're going to talk more about functions
06:51 - I'll do a more advanced tutorial um a
06:53 - little later on but this is just an
06:55 - introduction so that you can hopefully
06:57 - understand how they work pretty much you
06:58 - have if you're writing a function you
07:00 - have the defa keyword um you have the
07:04 - function name so this case it's
07:06 - highlighted in blue so I did add to then
07:09 - you have brackets and say for example
07:11 - when we do a function we can actually do
07:13 - one without a parameter so I could do
07:15 - Define to do something and in
07:19 - here I could simply print high right I
07:24 - don't need to have any parameters that
07:26 - just means when I call this function so
07:29 - do something I don't put anything inside
07:32 - of the brackets right we just do this
07:34 - and we see hi hello my name is Tim right
07:37 - um so yeah it doesn't have to have
07:39 - parameters it can have multiple
07:40 - parameters um if for example in this
07:43 - acceleration function you have multiple
07:44 - parameters that means that when you call
07:46 - the function so I'll do an example here
07:49 - then you're going to have to put two
07:50 - numbers in or two strings so I do two
07:53 - comma 5 like that and we'll print this
07:57 - to this to the screen because we don't
07:59 - print in that function so we can see
08:00 - what we're
08:02 - getting so yeah we get hi hello my name
08:05 - is Tim and then 10 right so acceleration
08:08 - 25 okay um so yeah that's just the
08:11 - basics of functions we're going to talk
08:13 - more about them uh in more in depth
08:14 - later but just try to understand how
08:16 - they work and yeah so if you like the
08:19 - video please like And subscribe and I
08:21 - will see you again later

anything what actually happens is in this add to call statement we have it sets x equal to 7 so it comes up here and it says okay we're going to add two to 7 so we have X here we add to and then we're

equal to a variable right now so I'll say new number is equal to add to 7 and now if I print out new number like this we get nine okay so that that's how that works all right now what about subtract two so we can do the same thing here with seven so we do subtract two we'll leave seven in here for number and you'll see we get five so that works correctly now I can do it again I could do 12 and we get 10 and maybe I could even change what I want to do in these functions so this one's called add two but maybe I wanted to add two to X and then I wanted to square it so then I would do that and then if we go back to the add two so I'm going to put 12 + 2^ 2 which would be 14 s which will be a pretty big number which will give us 196 just like that so you can kind of see um and understand how
