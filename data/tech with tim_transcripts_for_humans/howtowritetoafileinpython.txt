00:00 - in this video i'll show you how to write
00:01 - to a file in python to do this we first
00:03 - need to create a file i'm going to say
00:04 - file equals open i'm going to put the
00:05 - name of my file which is file.txt and
00:07 - then the mode to open the file in if the
00:08 - file doesn't already exist use w mode if
00:10 - it does already exist use a w will
00:12 - create a new file even if the file
00:13 - currently exists so we'll override an
00:15 - existing file a will open an existing
00:17 - file and append stuff to the end of it
00:19 - so if this file doesn't exist you can't
00:20 - open it in a mode anyways we're going to
00:22 - go in w mode i'm going to say file dot
00:24 - write and then i'm going to write my
00:26 - content like this and then after i'm
00:28 - done that i need to close the file so
00:30 - let's run the code and see if this may
00:31 - be a new file if i go here to my
00:33 - directory notice a new file opens file
00:35 - like that now let's do this in a mode if
00:37 - i put this in a mode and now that i run
00:39 - the code let me go open my file when i
00:41 - open my file notice we get hello world
00:42 - twice one other quick way to do this is
00:44 - the following you can use with open
00:46 - file.txt and now you no longer need to
00:48 - close the file because it will
00:49 - automatically close once it's done you
00:51 - need to do as file like this let's run
00:53 - the code now if i go back to my file and
00:55 - i look at it notice we have a low world
00:56 - three times hopefully this was helpful
00:58 - if it was follow for more
