00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another YouTube
00:02 - video in today's video I'm gonna be
00:03 - talking about how you can cool down your
00:05 - graphics card so a lot of people's
00:07 - graphics cards are on very hot there's a
00:09 - variety of different reasons why that
00:11 - may happen one may be just the case
00:14 - they're running and doesn't have enough
00:15 - intake not enough airflow in the case it
00:17 - could just be the card itself some cards
00:19 - do run very hot and depending on the
00:21 - cooler that comes with the card you're
00:23 - gonna get different temperatures on your
00:24 - card you can see my card here I have the
00:26 - AMD radon rx 480 and I'm running at 43
00:29 - degrees Celsius which is pretty warm
00:30 - considering this is not idle
00:32 - temperatures and I have good airflow in
00:34 - my case so on any other card this should
00:36 - have been running cooler but I mean my
00:37 - card in general it runs very hot it also
00:40 - could be if you have an overclock
00:41 - applied on your card and it's
00:42 - overheating or it's running really hot
00:44 - there's tons of different reasons why
00:46 - your card could be overheating one last
00:49 - one is just the dust buildup so this one
00:52 - a lot of people overlook or they don't
00:53 - realize especially if they don't have a
00:55 - side panel in their case is that if you
00:57 - haven't opened up your computer in a
00:58 - year or you haven't looked inside or
01:01 - even cleaned it out there's gonna be a
01:02 - huge amount of dust building up inside
01:04 - of your components and inside of your
01:06 - case especially if you don't have
01:07 - positive airflow in your case so what
01:10 - you're gonna want to do is clean that
01:12 - dust out because if you have dust
01:13 - building up in the fans and in the cards
01:15 - and the components then that's obviously
01:17 - gonna create a lot more heat so to do
01:20 - that you can get an electronic duster
01:22 - they're like 10 bucks off Amazon where
01:24 - at Staples or whatever you want to get
01:26 - them from and just blow em out at your
01:27 - components to get rid of all the dust
01:28 - and that should definitely make them run
01:30 - cooler so say you've looked inside your
01:32 - case and there's no dust buildup you
01:34 - have good airflow well what can I do to
01:36 - make my card run cooler now this method
01:39 - here that I'm gonna show you is
01:40 - completely software related so you don't
01:42 - have to actually do anything inside your
01:43 - case all you're gonna have to do is
01:45 - download msi afterburner so that's the
01:46 - program I have open right now and you
01:50 - can do that by simply going to their
01:51 - website I'm gonna leave a link in the
01:53 - description below now once you've
01:55 - downloaded that you'll see the
01:56 - temperature on the side mine is that 43
01:57 - right now should see all these little
01:59 - bars don't worry about those all we're
02:01 - gonna do is click on the Settings button
02:02 - right here now once we do that we're
02:05 - gonna click on fan now what we're
02:07 - actually going to do here is we're gonna
02:09 - move our fan up so that we're making it
02:12 - run faster
02:13 - so pretty much the faster we run our fan
02:15 - the cooler our card is going to be so we
02:17 - can see we have a little grid here with
02:19 - fan speed and temperature now you don't
02:22 - want to play with this too much but what
02:24 - we're gonna do is pretty much just move
02:25 - up all of these things so that our fan
02:28 - speed is running higher per temperature
02:30 - so you're just gonna move these bars up
02:33 - like so and you can just play around
02:37 - with them until it's at a speed that
02:40 - you're happy with and you can check the
02:42 - temperature while you're running games
02:44 - by just leaving this open and going to
02:45 - check that now once you've done that all
02:47 - you have to do it's pretty much click OK
02:49 - and you should start to hear the fan go
02:52 - louder in your computer especially if it
02:54 - is a louder fan and you can see here my
02:57 - fan just jumped from 36 to 45 now if you
03:00 - want to turn off this preset fan that
03:02 - you just changed all you have to do is
03:04 - click on this setting button here that's
03:06 - highlighting a red around the fan speed
03:08 - now if you click that you can see my fan
03:10 - speed drops all the way back to 19 and I
03:13 - should see my temperatures start to rise
03:14 - a little bit because the fan is gonna be
03:16 - running so much slower so you can see
03:19 - that's what we've just done is we made a
03:22 - custom fan profile so that we're
03:24 - actually changing how fast our fan runs
03:27 - per temperature on the card so if we go
03:30 - back to that we go to fan right here you
03:33 - can see we have the grid we have
03:35 - temperature and we have fan speed so for
03:36 - example here at a hundred degrees which
03:39 - is not safe for the card our fan will be
03:41 - running at a hundred percent to get all
03:43 - of that heat off the cart now if I go
03:45 - back and I change from custom here to
03:47 - default you can see that this profile
03:50 - has moved and that's just because of the
03:52 - way I changed it right now same thing
03:54 - here if you actually don't want to cool
03:56 - down your card but you want your fan to
03:58 - go slower say you're fine if your card
04:00 - is running hotter but you just don't
04:02 - want to hear the sound you can move all
04:04 - of these values down so that at thirty
04:07 - degrees here you're only running at 21%
04:10 - fan speed which you can't really hear so
04:13 - that's the way that you can change the
04:14 - fan settings on your card so by default
04:18 - they come with once you hit 30 degrees
04:21 - we're at 30% fan speed but if you change
04:23 - that by yourself then you can kind of
04:25 - control the temperature of your card
04:27 - and the volume of your cards to the
04:29 - acoustics which is a really nice thing
04:30 - to be able to do especially if you're
04:32 - running a really high-end game and you
04:34 - see your cards running at 85 degrees
04:35 - Celsius maybe you want to cool that down
04:37 - you can just change the fan speed with
04:40 - that fan profile so you can also change
04:42 - the fan speed by simply unclicking this
04:44 - and unclicking auto and just setting it
04:46 - to whatever you want it to be so by
04:48 - dragging that bar but that's not good
04:50 - because then that means every single
04:51 - time that you want the to change the fan
04:54 - speed you have to go back and drag that
04:56 - bar so yeah that is pretty much how you
04:59 - can cool down your graphics card it's
05:01 - really simple way just using software
05:02 - just like clicking a little setting
05:04 - button here and just changing the fan
05:05 - profile so if you enjoyed please leave a
05:08 - like and subscribe and I'll see you
05:09 - again in another
