00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - so about a month ago i told all of you
00:10 - that my tech startup velocity was hiring
00:13 - software engineers specifically game
00:15 - developers now i received hundreds of
00:17 - applications for this role and thank you
00:19 - to everyone who applied i personally
00:21 - read through every single application
00:23 - and i'm still going through them today
00:25 - now i'm not going to lie to you guys i
00:26 - was pretty disappointed in the quality
00:28 - of applicant and just the amount of
00:30 - effort that went into the applications
00:32 - so much so that i felt the need to make
00:34 - this video and share with you all of the
00:36 - things that you should never do if you
00:38 - want to get hired by a tech company or
00:40 - even get an email response these are
00:42 - really simple things in some cases
00:44 - they're single words that you just
00:45 - shouldn't include in your application
00:47 - and i guarantee if you follow what i say
00:49 - in this video you're gonna have a much
00:51 - higher chance of actually getting an
00:52 - interview and getting some response
00:54 - based on your applications again i don't
00:56 - want to single any of you out here but i
00:58 - really think that i can help you because
01:00 - a lot of these applications i'm talking
01:02 - about ninety percent of the applications
01:03 - i received i was able to rule out in
01:05 - about five or ten seconds of reading
01:07 - through them and i really wanted to hire
01:09 - game developers i wanted to hire as many
01:11 - of you as i could but some of you just
01:12 - made it completely impossible for me to
01:14 - even consider you so with that said
01:16 - let's get into the video and i'll share
01:18 - with you what you should never do if you
01:19 - want to get hired by a tech company but

02:12 - in the description thanks again design
02:14 - now for sponsoring this video alright so
02:16 - let's start here with first impressions
02:18 - now obviously first impressions are very
02:20 - important but they are especially
02:22 - important when you are trying to stand
02:23 - out from hundreds of other people and
02:25 - you have someone like me who doesn't
02:27 - want to spend 10 hours reading every
02:29 - single aspect of an application so what
02:31 - you need to understand about say a
02:33 - manual review process here of applicants
02:35 - which a lot of smaller companies like my
02:37 - company is doing is that as the person
02:40 - reviewing your application i am going to
02:42 - take any opportunity i can to move your
02:44 - application into the trash pile the
02:46 - reason for that is i want less
02:47 - applications to review and i want to
02:49 - narrow down all of the possible
02:51 - applicants before i start reading into
02:53 - all of their applications more in depth
02:55 - i'd rather really quickly scan through
02:57 - 300 applications then look more in depth
02:59 - at say 20 or 30 of them before maybe
03:02 - reaching out and contacting a few people
03:04 - then read every single application all
03:06 - the way through so if you give me a
03:08 - reason why i can move your application
03:10 - into the trash pile i'm going to do that
03:12 - so what am i talking about when i say
03:13 - this well a lot of you in the first
03:15 - sentence of let's say the long answer
03:17 - aspect of the application where i asked
03:19 - you something like what's your
03:20 - experience or what are some games that
03:22 - you've built in the past you started
03:24 - very first sentence first impression
03:26 - saying i have no experience i am just
03:28 - beginning i am a beginner i don't know
03:31 - react i don't know javascript i don't
03:33 - know this i'm not good at this or
03:35 - alternatively you said something like i
03:37 - want this job because or i want to work
03:39 - with tim or i'm looking forward to
03:41 - working in a tech startup now all of
03:44 - those things are not necessarily bad to
03:45 - say but they're not the first thing that
03:47 - you should lead off with when you're
03:49 - trying to grab someone's attention for
03:51 - me for example as soon as i read the
03:52 - word beginner if that was in the first
03:54 - or second sentence of your application i
03:56 - immediately put it into the trash
03:57 - because even though yes you may be
03:59 - someone that i could train you may be
04:00 - someone that's going to be a great
04:02 - member of the team and really committed
04:04 - right now as a tech startup we're not
04:05 - looking for beginners we're looking for
04:07 - people that are confident people that
04:08 - know what they're doing and people that
04:10 - want to work and that i don't have to
04:11 - handhold when they're building different
04:13 - games now this goes with another section
04:15 - of this video which is knowing the role
04:17 - but you don't want to start out with
04:18 - something negative or something that
04:20 - gives someone a reason to discredit you
04:22 - or to move you away from the possible
04:24 - applicant pile you want to start with
04:26 - something along the lines of i have
04:27 - experience in react in javascript i'm
04:30 - confident that i would be a good
04:32 - person for this role you want to do
04:33 - something that gives some passion that
04:35 - gives some energy that shares experience
04:38 - that gives me a reason to continue
04:40 - reading your application and if you can
04:41 - make it unique that's great for example
04:44 - all of the applications that started
04:45 - with something like i'm an athlete
04:47 - myself as well as a programmer i read
04:49 - the entire application the reason for
04:50 - that is that the company that we're
04:52 - building has to do with athletics so if
04:54 - you're someone who's an athlete and you
04:56 - know at a program i'm interested in you
04:58 - because even if i can't use you as a
04:59 - software engineer maybe you have some
05:01 - other role in the company so that's what
05:02 - i'm talking about here you want to build
05:04 - a good first impression and you want to
05:06 - avoid putting anything in the first few
05:08 - lines of your application that allows
05:10 - someone to stop reading the application
05:12 - or kind of rule you out due to a red
05:14 - flag alright so moving on to section two
05:16 - here which is projects now once i've
05:19 - gone through kind of the basic text of
05:21 - your application i'm gonna start
05:22 - clicking on links i'm going to look at
05:23 - your linkedin i'm going to look at
05:24 - different projects and i want to get a
05:26 - sense of what you're able to do so with
05:28 - projects here so many of you submitted
05:30 - projects that were not relevant at all
05:32 - to the role so you submitted stuff that
05:33 - was like a machine learning application
05:35 - or a python app or something that just
05:37 - was not a game or didn't show the
05:39 - ability to work with html css javascript
05:42 - etc which was listed under the job
05:44 - requirements so if you submitted any
05:46 - project even if you submitted five
05:47 - projects and one of the projects you
05:49 - submitted was completely irrelevant to
05:51 - what we asked you to submit i'm crossing
05:53 - you off because if that's one of the
05:54 - best projects you have and it's not even
05:56 - relevant to the role it's another reason
05:58 - for me to get rid of you right now with
06:00 - the projects a lot of you also submitted
06:02 - just super basic projects you submitted
06:05 - stuff that anyone was able to do it's
06:06 - been a tic-tac-toe application you
06:08 - submitted stuff that was just ripped
06:10 - from my tutorials or ripped from other
06:11 - people's tutorials right that was just
06:13 - almost the exact same code not that i
06:15 - went and looked at the code but i just
06:16 - knew looking at the project how you came
06:18 - up with this you didn't submit anything
06:20 - that was original at all right so if you
06:22 - did that again immediately i've just
06:24 - crossed you off of the list here
06:25 - continuing some people submitted like 20
06:28 - projects you submit 20 projects i'm not
06:30 - going to go look at all 20 projects i'm
06:32 - going to look at maybe the first three
06:33 - i'm going to click on a few random ones
06:35 - so if coincidentally the one that i
06:37 - clicked on looks really bad that's too
06:38 - bad right so i'm fortunate because now
06:40 - that's the impression that i've got of
06:42 - one of the three projects that i looked
06:44 - at so what i would recommend for the
06:45 - projects here is make sure you're only
06:47 - submitting at most i'd say like three
06:50 - projects on something like this that the
06:52 - projects are relevant to what the role
06:54 - actually is so in this case they're
06:55 - games or they show you have the ability
06:57 - to make games or they're a really
06:59 - polished portfolio website or react
07:01 - website and that all of the projects you
07:04 - submit look really good are completely
07:06 - polished are things that could be a
07:08 - production application
07:09 - also all of the projects need to be
07:11 - click and run they can't be things where
07:13 - i got to download the github repository
07:15 - i got to build the npm packages i got to
07:17 - host it on localhost if you do something
07:20 - like that i'm just not going to do that
07:21 - that's too much effort for me to go
07:23 - through just to find out that oh this is
07:25 - from a tutorial or you're not even going
07:27 - to be the person that i end up
07:28 - interviewing so you have to understand
07:29 - again from the interview perspective i
07:31 - want it to be as easy for me as possible
07:33 - to look at your application and get rid
07:35 - of it so don't make it easy for me to do
07:37 - that make it really hard give me a
07:38 - really polished project give me two
07:40 - really polished projects
07:42 - do a few really good games or show me
07:44 - that you have the ability to do that as
07:46 - soon as i see that now i'm excited and i
07:48 - want to look through the rest of your
07:49 - application and i'm kind of rooting for
07:51 - you at this point right after looking
07:52 - through hundreds of really really bad
07:54 - applications so that's what i have on
07:56 - projects again the first impression of
07:58 - projects is super important they need to
08:00 - look good they need to be relevant they
08:02 - can't be simple or trivial and you don't
08:04 - need to submit 100 of them if you submit
08:06 - 100 i'm not going to look through all of
08:07 - them i'm only going to look through two
08:09 - or three anyways so pick your two or
08:10 - three best ones and put those forward
08:12 - all right so next section here is on
08:14 - confidence
08:15 - self doubt now when i was reading these
08:17 - applications one of the tones i was kind
08:19 - of looking for in your writing was
08:21 - confidence the fact that you had the
08:23 - ability to do the job you knew you could
08:25 - do the job there wasn't any doubt that
08:27 - you were going to be able to fulfill the
08:29 - role that you were going to be able to
08:30 - complete what was being asked of you as
08:32 - soon as there was even a little hint
08:34 - that you weren't sure of yourself that
08:36 - you didn't quite know if you were going
08:37 - to have the the skills or the chops for
08:39 - lack of a better word to complete the
08:40 - job again i had to throw your
08:42 - application out unfortunately in this
08:44 - type of role i can't be someone who's
08:46 - motivating you or training you
08:48 - constantly or hand holding you through
08:50 - what you need to do this isn't something
08:52 - where we're trying to ramp someone up
08:53 - over a few months this is a role where
08:55 - we need someone to come in and finish
08:57 - the job without really any help at all
09:00 - yes i can give you you know a few
09:01 - minutes a day or i can you know walk
09:03 - through how to set up the repository or
09:04 - something but beyond that there can't be
09:07 - a kind of reliance on someone else or
09:09 - this you know doubt of ability so just a
09:11 - note there you want to be confident
09:13 - obviously you don't want to overstep and
09:14 - become super arrogant in your
09:16 - application but honestly i would rather
09:18 - read an application from someone who
09:19 - knows what they're doing who says yes
09:20 - i'm a professional i make games this is
09:22 - what i do i have this much experience i
09:24 - absolutely can complete this job as
09:26 - opposed to someone saying well i'm just
09:28 - getting started and you know i'm really
09:30 - motivated about learning i want to join
09:31 - the company i want to work with tim and
09:34 - they just this kind of hint of
09:35 - self-doubt right they're not giving me
09:37 - this confidence it's not giving me the
09:38 - fact that they know how to do this
09:40 - they're saying well i think i can figure
09:41 - it out and that's great for a lot of
09:43 - other types of roles but i don't want
09:44 - someone who thinks i want someone who
09:46 - knows all right so next section here is
09:47 - to give more than you take now this is
09:50 - in really any area of life you are going
09:52 - to be attracted to someone if you offer
09:54 - them more than you are going to take
09:56 - from them this is the case in
09:58 - relationships this is the case in
09:59 - employment agreements this is the case
10:01 - in any type of relationship that you
10:03 - have with a seller with a company
10:05 - however it may be there's always some
10:07 - reciprocation right and people don't
10:08 - want to be in relationships where
10:10 - they're giving more than they are
10:12 - getting from the other person and they
10:13 - feel there's not a accurate say value
10:16 - exchange or i guess a fair value
10:18 - exchange so when you are trying to get a
10:21 - job what you want to be doing is saying
10:23 - this is what i'm going to give you this
10:24 - is what i can give to the company this
10:26 - is how i'm going to be an asset this is
10:28 - how i can help you you do not want to be
10:29 - saying this is what i want from the
10:31 - company some companies will ask you that
10:33 - and it's fine to answer and you can give
10:35 - some answers to that but you want to be
10:37 - very careful how you phrase that because
10:38 - the last thing i want to do is hire
10:40 - someone who just wants to work with me
10:41 - and just wants to talk to me all day or
10:44 - just wants to learn that's all they want
10:46 - to do right they just want to get
10:47 - experience in a startup they don't want
10:48 - to help us build games they don't want
10:50 - to help take this company to another
10:51 - level right they're not saying those
10:53 - things they're saying this is what i
10:54 - want from the company not this is what
10:56 - i'm going to give you and this is what
10:57 - i'm going to do for you even if you do
10:59 - want those things the most likely way to
11:01 - get them is to first state what you're
11:03 - going to offer and then later on you
11:05 - sprinkle in a little bit of okay this is
11:07 - why i'm interested this is why i want to
11:08 - work from you it's a balance and you
11:10 - need to make sure you are giving more
11:12 - than you are taking otherwise like in
11:14 - anything people don't want to have a
11:15 - relationship with you especially
11:17 - employees so hopefully this is making a
11:18 - bit of sense general rule in life if
11:20 - you're trying to sell something to
11:21 - someone give them more than you are
11:23 - asking from them that's the only reason
11:25 - someone would buy a product from you
11:26 - they think they're getting more than how
11:28 - much money they're giving you for the
11:30 - product right or they think it's a fair
11:31 - value exchange so with that said let's
11:33 - move on to the next section all right so
11:35 - last section here and i can't even
11:36 - believe i'm saying this but you need to
11:38 - know the role when you are applying for
11:40 - a job you have to craft your application
11:42 - around the specific role and understand
11:45 - that every company is looking for
11:46 - something slightly different and you
11:48 - want to make your application appear as
11:50 - though you are the ideal candidate for
11:52 - this specific role not any software
11:55 - developer role not any game developer
11:57 - role this specific role so that is why i
12:00 - was telling you before that a lot of the
12:02 - applications said i'm a beginner or i
12:03 - want to learn or i'll work for free i
12:05 - didn't even read through because that's
12:06 - not what we're looking for for this role
12:08 - i don't care if you work for free or if
12:10 - i have to pay you i just need this to
12:11 - get done so if you tell me i'm a
12:12 - beginner but i'll work for free i can't
12:14 - hire you that's more of a burden on me
12:16 - than it is if i just pay someone to do
12:18 - the job right so you need to read
12:20 - through the rule you need to completely
12:22 - understand it you need to accept the
12:23 - fact that maybe you aren't the ideal
12:25 - candidate and if that's the scenario
12:27 - maybe you don't apply or you omit saying
12:29 - a few things that just make you seem a
12:31 - lot worse uh than they do better right
12:34 - so kind of this whole section here just
12:36 - understand the role do some research you
12:38 - should have watched through the five
12:39 - minute video you should have read
12:41 - through the application online you
12:42 - should have tried to understand or put
12:44 - yourself in the shoes of me who's going
12:46 - to be hiring you and say what does tim
12:47 - want here does tim want to train someone
12:49 - for six months to learn how to do this
12:51 - or does tim want someone who can come in
12:53 - and complete the games hopefully the
12:54 - tone of my video would have you know
12:56 - kind of set that and explain that to you
12:58 - maybe that's my fault for not clearly
12:59 - articulating that but you want to put
13:01 - yourself in the shoes of the employer
13:02 - and say would i hire me right now
13:04 - writing this application am i the ideal
13:06 - candidate based on what i've written
13:08 - here and again i want to be clear i'm
13:09 - not saying lie i'm not saying to be
13:11 - untruthful or deceitful i'm just saying
13:13 - that there's a lot of times where you
13:14 - don't need to say something in the
13:16 - application and saying it is just going
13:18 - to hurt you a lot more than it's gonna
13:19 - help so with that said i think i'm gonna
13:20 - wrap it up here i hope this was not
13:22 - hurtful i hope you guys didn't take this
13:24 - personally i genuinely want to help you
13:26 - here i know a lot of you can be great
13:28 - software engineers you can be great in
13:30 - the role that you're talking about and
13:32 - that you probably would have been good
13:33 - for this company
13:34 - however some of the things you said were
13:35 - just too big of a red flag for me to
13:37 - take the risk at even interviewing you
13:39 - and spend that time and that's why i
13:41 - wanted to make this video so hopefully
13:43 - in the future you're going to have more
13:44 - luck and you can take some of this to
13:46 - heart and really consider it the next
13:47 - time you're writing an application where
13:49 - you're applying for any type of company
13:51 - so with that said i hope you guys
13:52 - enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a
13:54 - like subscribe to the channel and i will
13:55 - see you in the next one
13:58 - [Music]
14:04 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so about a month ago i told all of you that my tech startup velocity was hiring software engineers specifically game developers now i received hundreds of applications for this role and thank you to everyone who applied i personally read through every single application and i'm still going through them today now i'm not going to lie to you guys i was pretty disappointed in the quality of applicant and just the amount of effort that went into the applications so much so that i felt the need to make this video and share with you all of the things that you should never do if you want to get hired by a tech company or even get an email response these are really simple things in some cases they're single words that you just shouldn't include in your application and i guarantee if you follow what i say in this video you're gonna have a much higher chance of actually getting an interview and getting some response based on your applications again i don't want to single any of you out here but i really think that i can help you because a lot of these applications i'm talking about ninety percent of the applications i received i was able to rule out in about five or ten seconds of reading through them and i really wanted to hire game developers i wanted to hire as many of you as i could but some of you just made it completely impossible for me to even consider you so with that

are especially important when you are trying to stand out from hundreds of other people and you have someone like me who doesn't want to spend 10 hours reading every single aspect of an application so what you need to understand about say a manual review process here of applicants which a lot of smaller companies like my company is doing is that as the person reviewing your application i am going to take any opportunity i can to move your application into the trash pile the reason for that is i want less applications to review and i want to narrow down all of the possible applicants before i start reading into all of their applications more in depth i'd rather really quickly scan through 300 applications then look more in depth at say 20 or 30 of them before maybe reaching out and contacting a few people then read every single application all the way through so if you give me a reason why i can move your application into the trash pile i'm going to do that so what am i talking about when i say this well a lot of you in the first sentence of let's say the long answer aspect of the application where i asked you something like what's your experience or what are some games that you've built in the past you started very first sentence first impression saying i have no experience i am just beginning i am a beginner i don't know react i don't know javascript i don't know this i'm not good at this or alternatively you said something like i want this job because or i want to work with tim or i'm looking forward to working in a tech startup now all of those things are not necessarily bad to say but they're not the first thing that you should lead off with when you're trying to grab someone's attention for me for example as soon as i read the word beginner if that was in the first or second sentence of your application i immediately put it into the trash because even though yes you may be someone that i could train you may be someone that's going to be a great member of the team and really committed right now as a tech startup we're not looking for beginners we're looking for people that are confident people that know what they're doing and people that want to work and that i don't have to handhold when they're building different games now this goes with another section of this video which is knowing the role but you don't want to start out with something negative or something that gives someone a reason to discredit you or to move you away from the possible applicant pile you want to start with something along the lines of i have experience in react in javascript i'm confident that i would be a good person for this role you want to do something that gives some passion that gives some energy that shares experience that gives me a reason to continue reading your application and if you can make it unique that's great for example all of the applications that started with something like i'm an athlete myself as well as a programmer i read the entire application the reason for that is that the company that we're building has to do with athletics so if you're someone who's an athlete and you know at a program i'm interested in you because even if i can't use you as a software engineer maybe you have some other role in the company so that's what i'm talking about here you want to build a good first impression and you want to avoid putting anything in the first few lines of your application that allows someone to stop reading the application or kind of rule you out due to a red flag alright so moving on to section two here which is projects now once i've gone through kind of the basic text of your application i'm gonna start clicking on links i'm going to look at your linkedin i'm going to look at different projects and i want to get a sense of what you're able to do so with projects here so many of you submitted projects that were not relevant at all to the role so you submitted stuff that was like a machine learning application or a python app or something that just was not a game or didn't show the ability to work with html css javascript etc which was listed under the job requirements so if you submitted any project even if you submitted five projects and one of the projects you submitted was completely irrelevant to what we asked you to submit i'm crossing you off because if that's one of the best projects you have and it's not even relevant to the role it's another reason for me to get rid of you right now with the projects a lot of you also submitted just super basic projects you submitted stuff that anyone was able to do it's been a tictactoe application you submitted stuff that was just ripped from my tutorials or ripped from other people's tutorials right that was just almost the exact same code not that i went and looked at the code but i just knew looking at the project how you came up with this you didn't submit anything that was original at all right so if you did that again immediately i've just crossed you off of the list here continuing some people submitted like 20 projects you submit 20 projects i'm not going to go look at all 20 projects i'm going to look at maybe the first three i'm going to click on a few random ones so if coincidentally the one that i clicked on looks really bad that's too bad right so i'm fortunate because now that's the impression that i've got of one of the three projects that i looked at so what i would recommend for the projects here is make sure you're only submitting at most i'd say like three projects on something like this that the projects are relevant to what the role actually is so in this case they're games or they show you have the ability to make games or they're a really polished portfolio website or react website and that all of the projects you submit look really good are completely polished are things that could be a production application also all of the projects need to be click and run they can't be things where i got to download the github repository i got to build the npm packages i got to host it on localhost if you do something like that i'm just not going to do that that's too much effort for me to go through just to find out that oh this is from a tutorial or you're not even going to be the person that i end up interviewing so you have to understand again from the interview perspective i want it to be as easy for me as possible to look at your application and get rid of it so don't make it easy for me to do that make it really hard give me a really polished project give me two really polished projects do a few really good games or show me that you have the ability to do that as soon as i see that now i'm excited and i want to look through the rest of your application and i'm kind of rooting for you at this point right after looking through hundreds of really really bad applications so that's what i have on projects again the first impression of projects is super important they need to look good they need to be relevant they can't be simple or trivial and you don't need to submit 100 of them if you submit 100 i'm not going to look through all of them i'm only going to look through two or three anyways so pick your two or three best ones and put those forward all right so next section here is on confidence self doubt now when i was reading these applications one of the tones i was kind of looking for in your writing was confidence the fact that you had the ability to do the job you knew you could do the job there wasn't any doubt that you were going to be able to fulfill the role that you were going to be able to complete what was being asked of you as soon as there was even a little hint that you weren't sure of yourself that you didn't quite know if you were going to have the the skills or the chops for lack of a better word to complete the job again i had to throw your application out unfortunately in this type of role i can't be someone who's motivating you or training you constantly or hand holding you through what you need to do this isn't something where we're trying to ramp someone up over a few months this is a role where we need someone to come in and finish the job without really any help at all yes i can give you you know a few minutes a day or i can you know walk through how to set up the repository or something but beyond that there can't be a kind of reliance on someone else or this you know doubt of ability so just a note there you want to be confident obviously you don't want to overstep and become super arrogant in your application but honestly i would rather read an application from someone who knows what they're doing who says yes i'm a professional i make games this is what i do i have this much experience i absolutely can complete this job as opposed to someone saying well i'm just getting started and you know i'm really motivated about learning i want to join the company i want to work with tim and they just this kind of hint of selfdoubt right they're not giving me this confidence it's not giving me the fact that they know how to do this they're saying well i think i can figure it out and that's great for a lot of other types of roles but i don't want someone who thinks i want someone who knows all right so next section here is to give more than you take now this is in really any area of life you are going to be attracted to someone if you offer them more than you are going to take from them this is the case in relationships this is the case in employment agreements this is the case in any type of relationship that you have with a seller with a company however it may be there's always some reciprocation right and people don't want to be in relationships where they're giving more than they are getting from the other person and they feel there's not a accurate say value exchange or i guess a fair value exchange so when you are trying to get a job what you want to be doing is saying this is what i'm going to give you this is what i can give to the company this is how i'm going to be an asset this is how i can help you you do not want to be saying this is what i want from the company some companies will ask you that and it's fine to answer and you can give some answers to that but you want to be very careful how you phrase that because the last thing i want to do is hire someone who just wants to work with me and just wants to talk to me all day or just wants to learn that's all they want to do right they just want to get experience in a startup they don't want to help us build games they don't want to help take this company to another level right they're not saying those things they're saying this is what i want from the company not this is what i'm going to give you and this is what i'm going to do for you even if you do want those things the most likely way to get them is to first state what you're going to offer and then later on you sprinkle in a little bit of okay this is why i'm interested this is why i want to work from you it's a balance and you need to make sure you are giving more than you are taking otherwise like in anything people don't want to have a relationship with you especially employees so hopefully this is making a bit of sense general rule in life if you're trying to sell something to someone give them more than you are asking from them that's the only reason someone would buy a product from you they think they're getting more than how much money they're giving you for the product right or they think it's a fair value exchange so with that said let's move on to the next section all right so last section here and i can't even believe i'm saying this but you need to know the role when you are applying for a job you have to craft your application around the specific role and understand that every company is looking for something slightly different and you want to make your application appear as though you are the ideal candidate for this specific role not any software developer role not any game developer role this specific role so that is why i was telling you before that a lot of the applications said i'm a beginner or i want to learn or i'll work for free i didn't even read through because that's not what we're looking for for this role i don't care if you work for free or if i have to pay you i just need this to get done so if you tell me i'm a beginner but i'll work for free i can't hire you that's more of a burden on me than it is if i just pay someone to do the job right so you need to read through the rule you need to completely understand it you need to accept the fact that maybe you aren't the ideal candidate and if that's the scenario maybe you don't apply or you omit saying a few things that just make you seem a lot worse uh than they do better right so kind of this whole section here just understand the role do some research you should have watched through the five minute video you should have read through the application online you should have tried to understand or put yourself in the shoes of me who's going to be hiring you and say what does tim want here does tim want to train someone for six months to learn how to do this or does tim want someone who can come in and complete the games hopefully the tone of my video would have you know kind of set that and explain that to you maybe that's my fault for not clearly articulating that but you want to put yourself in the shoes of the employer and say would i hire me right now writing this application am i the ideal candidate based on what i've written here and again i want to be clear i'm not saying lie i'm not saying to be untruthful or deceitful i'm just saying that there's a lot of times where you don't need to say something in the application and saying it is just going to hurt you a lot more than it's gonna help so with that said i think i'm gonna wrap it up here i hope this was not hurtful i hope you guys didn't take this personally i genuinely want to help you here i know a lot of you can be great software engineers you can be great in the role that you're talking about and that you probably would have been good for this company however some of the things you said were just too big of a red flag for me to take the risk at even interviewing you and spend that time and that's why i wanted to make this video so hopefully in the future you're going to have more luck and you can take some of this to heart and really consider it the next time you're writing an application where you're applying for any type of company so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one you
