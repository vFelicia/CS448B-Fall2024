00:00 - so I remember when I first started
00:01 - programming one of the first things that
00:03 - I did was create a password generator
00:05 - you gave it a bunch of inputs so say the
00:07 - length of the password if you wanted
00:08 - special characters if you wanted any
00:10 - characters omitted and then it went
00:11 - ahead and generated that password so the
00:13 - best example of this is say you go and
00:15 - try to create a new account on some
00:17 - website and then you get that little
00:18 - notification popping up or you get that
00:20 - little red line saying hey your password
00:21 - isn't strong enough maybe you don't have
00:23 - enough digits or whatever it may be and
00:25 - then the opposite of that is actually
00:26 - creating or recommending a password to a
00:29 - user so definitely a great idea and a
00:32 - great beginner programming project
