With timestamps:

00:00 - it's 2024 and despite the advancements
00:02 - with AI developers are still in extreme
00:04 - demand they're getting paid an insane
00:06 - amount of money and whether you're an
00:08 - experienced developer or a complete
00:10 - beginner one of the best things you can
00:11 - do to level up your skills in this year
00:14 - is learn a new language that's why in
00:16 - this video I'm going to share with you
00:18 - my top five programming languages that I
00:20 - recommend you learn in 2024 starting off
00:23 - our list we have JavaScript now this
00:26 - consistently ranks in the top five most
00:28 - in demand and popular program in
00:30 - languages in the world it's really a
00:32 - language you can't go wrong learning and
00:34 - something I recommend everyone has at
00:36 - least a little bit of understanding of
00:38 - now the great thing with JavaScript is
00:39 - that it's beginner friendly it's easy to
00:41 - learn and allows you to build a ton of
00:43 - different applications very quickly not
00:45 - only can you build websites frontend
00:47 - user interfaces but you can also work on
00:49 - the back end you can use Frameworks like
00:51 - node.js you can build mobile apps with
00:53 - things like react and react native and
00:56 - you can even go ahead and learn
00:57 - typescript on top of JavaScript and give
00:59 - yourself a more flexible language for
01:01 - working on larger systems this is
01:03 - something that I recommend specifically
01:05 - to beginners or people just starting out
01:07 - in your career if you don't yet know any
01:09 - programming languages JavaScript is a
01:11 - great one to start with and it's going
01:12 - to give you probably the most flexible
01:14 - language that you're starting with
01:16 - allowing you to build the most number of
01:17 - applications possible so if you don't
01:19 - really know where to start you don't
01:20 - know exactly what you want to do in the
01:22 - tech field or programming industry I
01:24 - definitely recommend starting with
01:26 - JavaScript there's all kinds of free
01:27 - courses online but if you do want
01:29 - something a bit more premium I do have a
01:30 - software development course which
01:32 - teaches JavaScript in depth which you
01:34 - can check out from the link in the
01:35 - description moving on the second item on
01:37 - our list is python now this is
01:39 - personally my favorite programming
01:41 - language and one I recommend to pretty
01:43 - much all beginner programmers I
01:45 - personally think every programmer should
01:46 - have some basic Python and that's
01:48 - because it's very versatile very easy to
01:50 - write in and very easy to learn now just
01:53 - like JavaScript python is extremely
01:55 - popular it's right up there in terms of
01:57 - demand and popularity it just has some
01:59 - different use cases and I'll kind of
02:01 - tell you which you should learn
02:02 - JavaScript or python based on your
02:04 - interest so python is more suited
02:06 - towards automation backend and data
02:09 - science related tasks if you're someone
02:10 - who's really interested in working on
02:12 - the front end you want to be a full
02:13 - stack developer you want to design
02:15 - websites frontend interfaces Etc
02:17 - javascript's going to be better for you
02:19 - if you're someone who's more interested
02:20 - in working with data creating automation
02:22 - projects you want to do machine learning
02:24 - apps you want to work with AI python is
02:27 - going to be a better choice for you with
02:29 - that said you can still create things
02:31 - like websites and games with python it's
02:33 - just not quite as flexible as a language
02:35 - like JavaScript and often times you'll
02:37 - end up actually using a bit of
02:38 - JavaScript with your python applications
02:41 - to get the full functionality that
02:42 - you're looking for with that said there
02:44 - is still great Frameworks like Jango and
02:46 - flask where you can build full-fledged
02:47 - websites and many have been built using
02:49 - languages like python so with that said
02:52 - quickly summarize here if you're more
02:53 - interested in websites frontend
02:55 - development and actually creating user
02:56 - interfaces highly recommend JavaScript
02:59 - if you're someone someone who is more
03:00 - interested in automation backend you
03:02 - don't really care that much about the
03:04 - graphics or the front end component of
03:05 - things then Python's probably a better
03:07 - choice also if you want to do anything
03:09 - with data working with machine learning
03:11 - AI definitely pick up python rather than
03:14 - JavaScript either way both great options
03:16 - both easy to learn and both beginner
03:18 - friendly languages I'd recommend one of
03:20 - those two if you're just starting out
03:22 - moving on the third language on my list
03:24 - is go or goang now this is a relatively
03:27 - new modern programming language at least
03:28 - compared to something like python this
03:31 - is very performant and something I'd
03:32 - highly recommend as your second language
03:35 - so once you've learned something like
03:36 - python or JavaScript you're comfortable
03:38 - with coding and you want to be a bit
03:40 - more of a well-rounded developer picking
03:42 - up a statically typed language like go
03:44 - is really going to help you do that and
03:46 - it's going to teach you a lot of
03:47 - features that you just don't need to
03:48 - know and learn when you're working with
03:50 - languages like JavaScript or python go
03:53 - is a much more highly performance
03:54 - language it's again more going to be
03:56 - focused on the back end but allows you
03:58 - to learn features like threading
04:00 - concurrency pointers references Etc and
04:03 - gives you a different style of language
04:05 - which will show you the contrast between
04:06 - dynamically typed languages and
04:08 - statically typed languages and also give
04:10 - you some more information or force you
04:11 - to learn about things like compilers
04:14 - interpreters Etc I won't get into this
04:16 - too much I don't want to confuse anyone
04:17 - if you're just a complete beginner but
04:19 - if you are someone who already knows
04:21 - JavaScript or python I highly recommend
04:23 - learning go now in terms of some of its
04:25 - strengths and use cases go has a very
04:27 - simple and readable syntax and brings
04:29 - you the performance of a language like
04:31 - C++ with the Simplicity of a language
04:34 - like python or JavaScript that's
04:36 - actually specifically how it was
04:37 - designed when it was designed at Google
04:40 - it's a pretty new language and it's very
04:42 - performant and specifically designed for
04:44 - building infrastructure cloud services
04:46 - backend Services Etc so if you are
04:49 - someone who is at all concerned about
04:51 - performance efficiency you like building
04:53 - distributed systems larger scale systems
04:55 - or you want to get into that field of
04:57 - computer science and just programming in
04:59 - general definitely pick up go you're
05:01 - going to see immediately that it has a
05:02 - bunch of features that you just probably
05:04 - didn't know exist because you wouldn't
05:06 - have seen them in languages like
05:07 - JavaScript and Python and most of all
05:09 - this is going to make you a better more
05:11 - rounded developer because you're going
05:13 - to learn how to work with a statically
05:14 - typed language this is actually the
05:16 - second language that we teach in my
05:18 - software development course if you're
05:19 - interested check it out from the link in
05:20 - the description moving on the fourth
05:22 - language on my list is rust now this is
05:25 - a language that's been gaining a ton of
05:26 - popularity over the past few years and
05:28 - it's specifically targeted at developers
05:30 - that are building performance critical
05:32 - applications so if you're working on a
05:34 - game engine an operating system systems
05:37 - level programming and you need something
05:39 - that's safe secure and reliable rust is
05:42 - the language for you this wouldn't be
05:43 - something I'd recommend to beginners
05:45 - it's a great second or third language in
05:47 - my opinion and something that you'd
05:49 - probably learn once you picked up the
05:50 - fundamentals of programming from a bit
05:52 - of an easier language similar to
05:54 - learning something like go this is going
05:55 - to teach you a lot of features in
05:57 - development and programming in general
05:59 - that you just didn't need to know in
06:00 - more simple languages like python or
06:02 - JavaScript and it's going to give you
06:04 - some flexibility to really create some
06:05 - more performant applications if you are
06:08 - interested in using concurrency this is
06:10 - also what rust is loved for overall the
06:12 - main feature that many people talk about
06:14 - related to rust is its memory safety
06:16 - with a lack of a garbage collector and
06:18 - this makes it a great language for
06:20 - building reliable and secure
06:22 - applications moving on the fifth
06:24 - language or languages on my list are
06:26 - going to be specifically targeted for
06:28 - mobile app Developers and that's going
06:30 - to be swift for the iOS side or for the
06:32 - Apple side and cotlin for the Android
06:35 - side I'm not going to talk about these
06:36 - languages too much but if you are
06:38 - someone who wants to create mobile apps
06:39 - so you want to be in the Apple ecosystem
06:41 - creating Mac apps iOS apps uh watch apps
06:45 - TV apps whatever you're going to want to
06:46 - learn Swift you can pretty much skip
06:48 - everything else I said in this video and
06:50 - just go directly over to that because
06:52 - that's all you're going to need to know
06:53 - that's the most native language you can
06:55 - learn it's pretty new it's pretty modern
06:57 - it's actually relatively easy to pick up
06:59 - and it's something again that you will
07:01 - do if you want to do any iOS or apple
07:03 - development on the other side we have
07:05 - cotlin now this is another modern
07:07 - language kind of similar to Swift in
07:09 - terms of what it accomplishes relatively
07:11 - easy to pick up has a lot of resources
07:13 - related to it and a bit easier on my
07:15 - opinion to use than something like Java
07:17 - now Java is also something you can do to
07:19 - build Android applications but cotlin is
07:21 - kind of the new way or has been for a
07:23 - while now to build Android applications
07:25 - so if you do want to do mobile apps skip
07:27 - what I said above and just go right into
07:29 - Swift or right into cotland those are
07:31 - going to be the only languages that you
07:32 - need to know and if you need to pick up
07:33 - some small scripting language on the
07:35 - side you can do that afterwards so to
07:37 - quickly summarize here if you are a
07:38 - complete beginner I recommend going with
07:40 - python or JavaScript for your first
07:42 - language once you've learned one of
07:44 - those you can diversify a bit and learn
07:45 - a statically typed language like go or
07:48 - rust if you're really focused on
07:49 - performance optimizations you think you
07:51 - might want to build things like
07:53 - operating systems and work with those
07:54 - low-level features definitely go with
07:56 - rust as an additional language and if
07:58 - you are someone interested in iOS or
08:00 - Android development then you can go with
08:02 - swift or cotlin respectively now at the
08:04 - end of the day guys programming
08:05 - languages really just our tools you
08:07 - should always select the best tool for
08:09 - the job and many of those tools are not
08:12 - listed in this video that doesn't mean
08:14 - they're not great languages doesn't mean
08:16 - you shouldn't learn them I simply put
08:18 - what I thought were the most popular
08:20 - flexible and versatile languages that
08:22 - you can't really go wrong learning so
08:24 - with that said I'll wrap it up here if
08:26 - you want to become a software developer
08:27 - as fast as possible then check out my
08:29 - software development course from the
08:31 - link in the description there is a free
08:32 - intro course there that tells you all
08:34 - the information you need to know before
08:35 - you make a commitment I hope you guys
08:37 - enjoyed if you did leave a like
08:39 - subscribe and I will see you in the next

it's 2024 and despite the advancements with AI developers are still in extreme demand they're getting paid an insane amount of money and whether you're an experienced developer or a complete beginner one of the best things you can do to level up your skills in this year is learn a new language that's why in this video I'm going to share with you my top five programming languages that I recommend
