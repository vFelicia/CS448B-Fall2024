00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the final
00:02 - video in this tutorial Series where I'll
00:04 - be talking to you about next steps and
00:06 - what you can actually build with cartei
00:09 - now the reality is you can build pretty
00:11 - much anything you can imagine and that's
00:13 - because with a framework like cartei
00:15 - you're not limited by the language or
00:17 - the technology you can go and use Python
00:19 - you can use JavaScript you can use the
00:21 - languages you already know and that
00:23 - immediately should give you a lot more
00:24 - ideas than if you had to build something
00:26 - in a traditional web 3 environment using
00:29 - something like solidity in this video
00:31 - though what I'll do is show you a few
00:33 - examples of projects that have already
00:34 - been built using cartei just to give you
00:36 - some inspiration and kind of show you
00:38 - what's actually possible so with that
00:40 - said let's hop over to the computer here
00:42 - let me go through a few examples and
00:44 - we'll talk about how you can get started
00:45 - building some real world projects today
00:48 - all right so I'm back on the rollup Lab
00:50 - website here highly recommend you check
00:52 - this out it'll be Link in the
00:53 - description and this is where there's a
00:55 - bunch of projects that are either being
00:56 - worked on or already completed that use
00:59 - cartez now as a reminder if you do
01:00 - actually want to build something out you
01:02 - could be eligible for some grant money
01:04 - meaning you get paid just to work on a
01:06 - project that you want to build if you
01:08 - want to check that out there will be a
01:09 - link in the description and you can
01:11 - actually set up a meeting and talk
01:12 - completely for free to some of the
01:14 - cartei staff and you can run through an
01:16 - idea that you have and they can kind of
01:17 - let you know if it's worth building if
01:19 - you could be eligible for a grant Etc so
01:22 - check out the links in the description
01:23 - but let's go through a few of the
01:25 - projects so cartei does a bunch of
01:27 - hackathons they also just have community
01:29 - members that are constantly working on
01:30 - projects I'm going to show you some that
01:32 - are fully finished but as we scroll
01:34 - through the page here you can see
01:35 - there's just so many different projects
01:37 - for example cartisian Battleship there
01:39 - is a chess one I actually really want
01:41 - this one to come out so I can try it cuz
01:43 - I play chess all the time but this is
01:45 - where you could actually wage your
01:46 - ethereum or you could wage your
01:47 - cryptocurrency on a chess game I think
01:49 - that'd be pretty cool there's Biometrics
01:52 - classifier Liquidator you can see a
01:53 - bunch of these are just being worked on
01:55 - or a proof of concept but some of them
01:57 - are actually finished or built during
01:58 - something like a hackathon now let me
02:00 - show you one that's actually fully built
02:02 - and we can look at a quick demo of it so
02:04 - this is called DCA dooner now DCA stands
02:07 - for dollar cost averaging and this is
02:10 - the idea of buying into a market at a
02:12 - certain frequency so for example every
02:14 - week every day every month every year
02:17 - and the idea is if you buy a small
02:18 - amount at a certain frequency your
02:22 - investment is kind of going to follow
02:23 - the trend of that market so if it's
02:25 - slowly going up over time it will slowly
02:27 - go up now this is a risk mitigation
02:29 - strategy so instead of putting all your
02:31 - money in at once and potentially buying
02:34 - really high or I guess really low you're
02:36 - kind of mitigating that and you're
02:38 - putting in a large sum over a period of
02:40 - time so that the fluctuations in the
02:42 - market aren't going to affect your
02:43 - overall investment as much I'm not an
02:46 - investment advisor so take what I say
02:47 - with a grain of salt here but that's the
02:49 - basic idea so the thing is on the
02:51 - blockchain or doing this with
02:53 - cryptocurrency is actually pretty
02:55 - difficult and a lot of times to do this
02:57 - there's some bugs you got to use a
02:58 - centralized Exchange is just not ideal
03:01 - so this project is actually built to
03:03 - allow you to do this using Unis swap so
03:05 - I can actually go to their web page here
03:07 - which is dc- monster. verell doapp and
03:11 - you can see that there's actually a way
03:13 - here to select the token that you want
03:14 - to buy with the token that you'd like to
03:16 - buy when you want to start when you want
03:18 - to end Etc and this will do a dollar
03:21 - cost average for you and automatically
03:23 - buy the token now I'm obviously not
03:25 - going to go through and actually do this
03:26 - myself but you can see that you can
03:28 - select the token address Etc and this is
03:30 - a function decentralized app that was
03:33 - built with caresan now the next project
03:35 - that was built is something called Bug
03:37 - list now this was built during a
03:38 - hackathon and caresan fored me that they
03:40 - do plan to actually improve this and
03:42 - move it forward but what this does is
03:44 - Implement a bug bounty on the blockchain
03:47 - or using web 3 now if you're unfamiliar
03:50 - with a bug Bounty this is typically a
03:51 - program set out by some kind of company
03:53 - that has some software and they say hey
03:55 - if you find a bug in our software we're
03:57 - going to pay you x amount of dollars to
03:59 - typically that amount is going to depend
04:01 - on the severity of the bug but for
04:02 - example Google has had bug Bounty
04:04 - programs that are like a million dollars
04:06 - for certain security bugs Etc now
04:09 - obviously the issue with this is that
04:10 - the company controls the flow of money
04:12 - they control how much that Bounty is
04:14 - going to be they could change that at
04:15 - any point in time there's no guarantee
04:17 - that they're necessarily going to pay
04:18 - you so putting this on the blockchain
04:20 - just removes all of that uncertainty and
04:23 - allows this to be handled by a smart
04:24 - contract or a cartei decentralized
04:27 - application so there's no question on
04:29 - what the amount is if you're going to
04:30 - get paid Etc now we could read through
04:33 - the description here if we want I can
04:35 - link this in the description for you
04:36 - guys to check out but pretty much what
04:38 - this does is implement the bug Bounty
04:39 - program using cartei so through a
04:41 - friendly web interface anyone can submit
04:43 - applications and sponsor them with ether
04:45 - to incentivize hackers all major wallets
04:47 - are supported meanwhile hackers can test
04:49 - their exploits right on the browser
04:50 - without even having to sign web through
04:52 - transactions once the hacker finds a
04:54 - valid exploit they can finally send a
04:56 - transaction requesting the reward be
04:57 - transferred to their account if however
04:59 - no one is able to submit a valid exploit
05:01 - until a certain deadline the sponsors
05:03 - May request a refund so kind of like a
05:05 - Marketplace almost where people can
05:07 - submit a project say hey find some bug
05:09 - if you find a bug I'm going to pay you x
05:10 - amount of dollars they find it they
05:12 - submit it and then they can get paid
05:14 - directly to their wallet this also means
05:16 - that it's Anonymous which is another
05:18 - great thing about web 3 moving on the
05:20 - next project that was built a long time
05:22 - ago using cesi is something called Texas
05:25 - hodum poker kind of a play on words of
05:27 - Texas Holdem now this is a decentralized
05:30 - Texas holder poker game using cartei
05:32 - again built a long time ago so it
05:34 - doesn't use the whole upto-date cartei
05:36 - framework not something I'd recommend
05:37 - using as a code reference but kind of a
05:39 - cool idea that illustrates the power of
05:41 - web 3 and the advantage of doing
05:43 - something like gambling or games like
05:45 - this in a decentralized fashion now I
05:48 - don't know if this story is completely
05:49 - accurate that I'm about to tell you but
05:50 - this is what I remember hearing a while
05:53 - ago there was actually a poker website
05:54 - that had a pretty big exploit or scam on
05:57 - it essentially one of the players that
05:59 - was playing playing could actually see
06:00 - everybody's cards while they were
06:02 - playing this was real money real
06:04 - gambling and this person obviously
06:05 - scammed a bunch of people exploited them
06:07 - out of a bunch of money and the reason
06:09 - why that was even possible was because
06:11 - this site was ran centralized there was
06:13 - someone controlling it they could easily
06:15 - change things they could let other
06:16 - people see your cards and that's the
06:18 - issue when you're doing anything
06:19 - involving money with a central Source
06:21 - you need to actually trust them right
06:24 - even things like Banks other entities
06:26 - that you'd hope you'd be able to trust
06:28 - they can often times do things things
06:29 - that are a little bit sketchy especially
06:31 - in maybe less developed Nations Etc and
06:33 - you want to be careful any type of
06:35 - entity that you're trusting especially
06:36 - with your money so when it comes to
06:38 - gambling when it comes to staking money
06:40 - when it comes to holding money it's
06:41 - obviously more advantageous to do that
06:43 - in a decentralized way because you can
06:45 - trust the source it's trustless you can
06:48 - go and verify the code you can read it
06:50 - for yourself you know it's running in a
06:51 - decentralized manner and there's no
06:53 - essential control no one can go in there
06:55 - and change things flip around settings
06:57 - Etc so just an example of a project that
07:00 - obviously takes advantage of web 3 and
07:02 - that trustless environment all right so
07:04 - excuse the Quick Change in location here
07:06 - I'm actually in a different country
07:07 - while filming this part of the video but
07:09 - I realized when I was watching it back I
07:11 - forgot to include a really great example
07:13 - which really demonstrates how cool some
07:15 - of this technology is so this here is
07:17 - called World Arcade now this actually
07:19 - allows you to play a game in your web
07:21 - browser and then kind of save the
07:22 - snapshot or replay of that game and then
07:25 - submit it to the blockchain where it's
07:26 - verifiable now I'm not going to lie to
07:28 - you I don't know exactly how all of this
07:30 - works the cartei team shared it with me
07:32 - as a great demo for you but there is
07:34 - some links that I'll leave in the
07:35 - description that kind of share more
07:37 - details about how this works you can
07:38 - read through it the basic idea is you're
07:40 - kind of running a game in the browser
07:43 - here you're able to play that game and
07:44 - then based on the score you get you can
07:46 - submit that to blockchain and that way
07:48 - we can verify who actually got the
07:49 - highest score and we can trust that
07:51 - information so it's not just like a
07:53 - hacker submitting a fake score or
07:55 - something anyways here is the famous
07:57 - game of Doom I can actually play this
07:59 - here here so I've connected my wallet to
08:00 - this application and you can see we can
08:03 - kind of move around here and I think I
08:05 - can shoot like this honestly I've never
08:08 - played this game before so I don't even
08:10 - know what you're supposed to do which
08:12 - will probably shock some of you but you
08:13 - get the idea so I'll play I'll get my
08:15 - score I can click on stop now it says my
08:18 - gam play is ready so I can download the
08:20 - game play or I can submit that so if I
08:22 - submit this it should pop up metamask
08:25 - and what I can do is actually make a
08:26 - submission here to the blockchain this
08:28 - is just running on a test Network so you
08:30 - guys can actually mess with it if you
08:31 - want it should then submit that score
08:33 - and then eventually you'll be able to
08:34 - see like a list of all the high scorers
08:36 - who got the best score who got the worst
08:38 - score Etc and it's provable and
08:40 - verifiable on the blockchain obviously
08:42 - this can work for other games as well
08:44 - but a really cool application that kind
08:46 - of demonstrates you the potential here
08:48 - of using something like caresia if you
08:50 - want to learn more I'll leave the links
08:51 - in the description so you guys can check
08:53 - it out now there's tons of other
08:54 - projects that I could share with you I
08:56 - just picked one here that I found
08:57 - interesting I'm not sure if this is
08:58 - fully finished but kind of a cool idea
09:00 - this is called ctis sign I'm not sure
09:02 - how you pronounce that and this is a
09:04 - handwritten Biometrics tool which can
09:06 - bring traditional security to the world
09:08 - of digital signature-based smart
09:10 - contracts so obviously we've used things
09:12 - like DocuSign or eign before those are
09:15 - great but they don't really work in a
09:16 - web three environment so my
09:18 - understanding from kind of reading
09:19 - through the description here is this is
09:21 - meant to kind of mitigate that or add
09:23 - that functionality where there's
09:24 - actually a Biometrics tool that you can
09:26 - use to kind of digitally sign something
09:28 - and it's more secure it can be Minted as
09:30 - an nft I'm probably butchering the
09:32 - explanation but you guys can read
09:33 - through this if you want and kind of
09:35 - have a look at exactly what this does
09:37 - anyways tons of cool projects being
09:39 - built using cartisian and the web 3
09:41 - ecosystem in general being able to build
09:43 - these with languages that you already
09:45 - know really opens up the possibilities
09:47 - of what you can do again the reality is
09:50 - you can build pretty much anything you
09:51 - want but obviously if you want to build
09:53 - something real world it's going to have
09:54 - to solve some problem and use case which
09:56 - is why I shared with you a few of the
09:58 - project that ideas in this video with
10:00 - that said guys I think I'll wrap up the
10:02 - video here I want to give a massive
10:04 - thank you to cartei for sponsoring this
10:06 - series and to you for watching if you've
10:08 - made it to video 8 that is a huge
10:10 - accomplishment not many people make it
10:12 - through these really long tutorial
10:13 - series especially when there's a lot of
10:15 - complex code setup Etc so if you've made
10:17 - it this far congratulations I hope you
10:20 - enjoyed I hope you learned a lot and
10:22 - that you're looking forward to building
10:23 - some more applications if you need any
10:25 - help support or resources again you can
10:27 - contact the caresi team from the link in
10:30 - the description and I look forward to
10:31 - seeing you in another YouTube
10:34 - [Music]
10:41 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to the final video in this tutorial Series where I'll be talking to you about next steps and what you can actually build with cartei now the reality is you can build pretty much anything you can imagine and that's because with a framework like cartei you're not limited by the language or the technology you can go and use Python you can use JavaScript you can use the languages you already know and that immediately should give you a lot more ideas than if you had to build something in a traditional web 3 environment using something like solidity in this video though what I'll do is show you a few examples of projects that have already been built using cartei just to give you some inspiration and kind of show you what's actually possible so with that said let's hop over to the computer here let me go through a few examples and we'll talk about how you can get started building some real world projects today all right so I'm back on the rollup Lab website here highly recommend you check this out it'll be Link in the description and this is where there's a bunch of projects that are either being worked on or already completed that use cartez now as a reminder if you do actually want to build something out you could be eligible for some grant money meaning you get paid just to work on a project that you want to build if you want to check that out there will be a link in the description and you can actually set up a meeting and talk completely for free to some of the cartei staff and you can run through an idea that you have and they can kind of let you know if it's worth building if you could be eligible for a grant Etc so check out the links in the description but let's go through a few of the projects so cartei does a bunch of hackathons they also just have community members that are constantly working on projects I'm going to show you some that are fully finished but as we scroll through the page here you can see there's just so many different projects for example cartisian Battleship there is a chess one I actually really want this one to come out so I can try it cuz I play chess all the time but this is where you could actually wage your ethereum or you could wage your cryptocurrency on a chess game I think that'd be pretty cool there's Biometrics classifier Liquidator you can see a bunch of these are just being worked on or a proof of concept but some of them are actually finished or built during something like a hackathon now let me show you one that's actually fully built and we can look at a quick demo of it so this is called DCA dooner now DCA stands for dollar cost averaging and this is the idea of buying into a market at a certain frequency so for example every week every day every month every year and the idea is if you buy a small amount at a certain frequency your investment is kind of going to follow the trend of that market so if it's slowly going up over time it will slowly go up now this is a risk mitigation strategy so instead of putting all your money in at once and potentially buying really high or I guess really low you're kind of mitigating that and you're putting in a large sum over a period of time so that the fluctuations in the market aren't going to affect your overall investment as much I'm not an investment advisor so take what I say with a grain of salt

can see that there's actually a way here to select the token that you want to buy with the token that you'd like to buy when you want to start when you want to end Etc and this will do a dollar cost average for you and automatically buy the token now I'm obviously not going to go through and actually do this myself but you can see that you can select the token address Etc and this is a function decentralized app that was built with caresan now the next project that was built is something called Bug list now this was built during a hackathon and caresan fored me that they do plan to actually improve this and move it forward but what this does is Implement a bug bounty on the blockchain or using web 3 now if you're unfamiliar with a bug Bounty this is typically a program set out by some

they control how much that Bounty is going to be they could change that at any point in time there's no guarantee that they're necessarily going to pay you so putting this on the blockchain just removes all of that uncertainty and allows this to be handled by a smart contract or a cartei decentralized application so there's no question on what the amount is if you're going to get paid Etc now

general being able to build these with languages that you already know really opens up the possibilities of what you can do again the reality is you can build pretty much anything you want but obviously if you want to build something real world it's going to have to solve some problem and use case which is why I shared with you a few of the project that ideas in this video with that said guys I think I'll wrap up the video here I want to give a massive thank you to cartei for sponsoring this series and to you for watching if you've made it to video 8 that is a huge accomplishment not many people make it through these really long tutorial series especially when there's a lot of complex code setup Etc so if you've made it this far congratulations I hope you enjoyed I hope you learned a lot and that you're looking forward to building some more applications if you need any help support or resources again you can contact the caresi team from the link in the description and I look forward to seeing you in another YouTube video
