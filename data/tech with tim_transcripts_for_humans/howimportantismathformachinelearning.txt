00:05 - what's going on should have a
00:06 - understanding of linear algebra basic
00:09 - calculus like something you'd take in
00:10 - grade 12 or first year university and
00:13 - then probably understand things like
00:14 - matrices vectors multi-dimensional math
00:16 - and just be generally speaking okay at
00:19 - reading like mathematical notation and
00:21 - comfortable kind of digging into it a
00:23 - little bit I'm not telling you you have
00:25 - to be a math whiz I am not a math genius
00:27 - myself but I did go through two years of
00:29 - math courses in University these were
00:31 - the computer science math classes and
00:33 - that helped me tremendously when I was
00:35 - learning machine learn so if you don't
00:36 - know the math it's fine you can still
00:38 - continue here but I will warn you it's
00:39 - going to be much more difficult to
00:41 - really grasp what's going on and I'd
00:43 - highly recommend you don't skip this if
00:45 - you have access to these kind of math
00:47 - courses
