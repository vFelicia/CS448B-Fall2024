00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - Raspberry Pi video now in today's video
00:04 - what I'm gonna be doing is showing you
00:05 - how to stream data using Python sockets
00:08 - so purely with Python code there's
00:11 - nothing else that we need to install on
00:12 - our Raspberry Pi all we need to do is
00:14 - just use this Python code that I'm gonna
00:15 - give you guys so you can view live image
00:18 - data from any machine that you want and
00:20 - it doesn't obviously have to be that
00:22 - Raspberry Pi itself because let's be
00:23 - honest what's the point of just having
00:25 - our Raspberry Pi camera if we can't view
00:27 - it from anywhere else so to do this what
00:30 - you're gonna do is first of all just
00:31 - download the code that I have in the
00:33 - description now this code is written by
00:35 - Raspberry Pi I've done some slight
00:37 - modifications to it to make it work a
00:39 - little bit better but other than that
00:41 - just download that code and it's gonna
00:42 - have what's known as a server script and
00:44 - a client script now before I move too
00:47 - far let me show you guys how this works
00:48 - you can get idea of what we're about to
00:50 - do so I'm just gonna run the server
00:52 - script here which is actually on the
00:53 - machine that's gonna be accepting the
00:55 - image data and then on my Raspberry Pi
00:57 - here I'm gonna run the client script and
01:00 - wait for that to load for one second
01:02 - and now if we just give this client and
01:04 - server a second to connect you can see
01:06 - that we're seeing this live image data
01:08 - from our Raspberry Pi now it's still
01:09 - laying about a second and you can see
01:11 - that it's pretty slow in the FPS I'm
01:14 - gonna talk about why and how you might
01:15 - speed that up and all of that fun stuff
01:17 - in just a second so I don't want to run
01:19 - this anymore so I'm just gonna go to
01:21 - tools cancel build and now let's talk
01:24 - about how to set this up so first of all
01:27 - we're want we want to get on the machine
01:28 - that we're gonna be accepting the image
01:30 - data from so whatever computer this is
01:32 - and you're gonna put the server PI
01:34 - script on it now what we're gonna do is
01:37 - first of all just modify the script a
01:40 - little bit to work for your computer so
01:42 - what we're gonna do is install some
01:44 - Python packages and then figure out what
01:46 - IP address we're gonna use for this
01:47 - server so we're gonna start by doing pip
01:50 - install and now hello and the reason I'm
01:55 - doing this is because I need to install
01:56 - some Python modules that will allow this
01:58 - script to run and the two modules we
02:00 - need our pillow and matplotlib now if
02:03 - you already have these installed go
02:04 - ahead and move forward but you probably
02:06 - don't so go ahead and run this command
02:08 - in your command prompt this stands for a
02:10 - package installer Python I believe or
02:13 - Python installer packages something like
02:15 - that and hit enter if I do that's now I
02:18 - already have this satisfied so it song
02:20 - and do anything but for you guys you
02:21 - should see a little loading bar and it
02:22 - should install that now after this we're
02:24 - gonna do pip install Matt's plot lib and
02:27 - this is what we're gonna use to actually
02:29 - view the image now you can view the
02:31 - image however you'd like for me I found
02:32 - that plot lib was just the easiest so
02:34 - that's what I'm gonna use now once
02:36 - you've done that you should be good to
02:37 - go if you're having issues with your pip
02:39 - and you're getting pip is unrecognized
02:41 - command I'm gonna leave a card to a
02:43 - video in the top right hand corner right
02:44 - now that's gonna show you how to install
02:46 - pip now I know it's gonna look like the
02:48 - wrong video because it talks about Pi
02:50 - game but watch to that video and it
02:51 - shows you how to fix your pip now after
02:54 - you've done that we're gonna type
02:55 - ipconfig in our console here in our
02:58 - command prompt and it should pop up
03:00 - something that looks like this now what
03:02 - we're looking for here is our ipv4
03:05 - address now this is the address or you
03:08 - might have an ipv6 one as well it should
03:11 - look something like this 192.168.1.1
03:14 - five nine except this one five nine
03:16 - it'll be different depending on what
03:18 - computer you're on
03:18 - you might also have one that looks like
03:20 - 10.10 Don something what we're gonna do
03:23 - is just copy this address and we're
03:25 - gonna use this as our server address now
03:28 - this is if we're gonna be working on our
03:29 - local network which means that your
03:31 - Raspberry Pi is on the same network as
03:33 - your computer that's trying to connect
03:35 - to it now if you're not working on your
03:37 - local network what you're gonna do is go
03:39 - to the internet and you're gonna search
03:40 - my IP like that like my public IP
03:43 - whatever it is and I'm gonna take that
03:46 - value and you're gonna use that for the
03:47 - rest of the tutorial I'm not gonna
03:49 - search this because I don't want to get
03:50 - ddosed by you guys but go ahead search
03:53 - my IP address it'll give it to you and
03:54 - then that way you can use that as a
03:56 - server address so you can see that
03:58 - mine's already punched in here but right
04:00 - here we're just gonna put in the server
04:01 - address so where it's a server socket
04:03 - dump bind and that's all we need to do
04:05 - from this computer now time to go over
04:08 - to the Raspberry Pi so let's load that
04:09 - up now so on the Raspberry Pi we are
04:12 - gonna need this um what do you call it
04:15 - this client script that we've downloaded
04:17 - as well so find some way to get it over
04:19 - to the Raspberry Pi however you need to
04:20 - do that and what you're gonna paste that
04:22 - same address that you put on the server
04:24 - script into here now if you're on your
04:27 - local network
04:27 - again it should be something like this
04:29 - so one nine one nine two or like a 10.10
04:32 - or something like that if you're on
04:34 - you're just like Internet in general not
04:37 - local network then it's gonna be some
04:39 - arbitrary number right so now that we've
04:41 - done that it's actually time to start
04:43 - streaming the data it's as easy as that
04:45 - we'll go through how the script works in
04:46 - a second but what you're gonna want to
04:48 - do is go to your main computer so one
04:50 - that's gonna be accepting the images and
04:51 - run the script now to do this you're
04:54 - gonna whatever editor using just run the
04:56 - script so for me it's controlled be
04:57 - gonna wait a second and you shouldn't
05:00 - see any output because we haven't yet
05:02 - connected the Raspberry Pi so this is
05:04 - gonna wait for a connection and just be
05:06 - running in the background idle until
05:07 - eventually we connect so if we go to a
05:11 - Raspberry Pi now and we run this client
05:14 - script so I'm just gonna click f5 to do
05:15 - this now you should see in about a few
05:18 - seconds it connects and it's ready to go
05:20 - so now you can see we're getting some
05:22 - outputs as image is verified which
05:24 - essentially is just telling us that this
05:25 - image is actually working or we're
05:26 - getting it through and then we can see
05:28 - our live feed like this now I'm gonna go
05:31 - through the script and explain to you
05:32 - how it works so you get an idea of how
05:34 - you can modify it and play with it by
05:36 - yourself but that's all you need to do
05:38 - to view the live feed and the great
05:41 - thing with this is all your image data
05:42 - is coming in through Python code which
05:44 - means you can draw things on it you can
05:46 - add things to it you can turn it around
05:47 - you do whatever you want with it rather
05:49 - than getting a live feed from some other
05:51 - kind of you know area right so what I'm
05:54 - gonna do essentially is just walk you
05:56 - guys through this so this first part
05:57 - here is setting up what's known as the
05:59 - socket now a socket is how incoming
06:02 - connections are gonna connect to this
06:04 - machine and essentially what's gonna
06:05 - happen and you need either you need to
06:07 - be on some kind of network obviously for
06:09 - this to work he's gonna set up a port
06:11 - that's looking for connections and then
06:13 - the other script that we have is going
06:14 - to connect to them now once we accept a
06:16 - connection we're gonna create a file
06:18 - object that's readable which means we're
06:21 - gonna look for a file and read it and
06:23 - the other script is actually going to
06:24 - write to a file now what we're gonna do
06:26 - here is just run a while loop that's
06:28 - gonna constantly grab information from
06:30 - this file and that information is going
06:32 - to be our binary image data so what
06:35 - we're gonna do is use this which we're
06:37 - going to use a struct and I'm talking
06:38 - about how this works to essentially
06:39 - unpack our information
06:41 - take it into our code we're gonna make
06:43 - sure that we're actually getting image
06:45 - data and if we're not so if not image
06:47 - data we're gonna break and get out of
06:48 - this while loop we're gonna turn this
06:50 - into bytes io which is just kind of like
06:53 - a streaming thing we're gonna write to
06:57 - this bytes IO which is like a streaming
06:58 - thing the stuff that we read from our
07:01 - connection then what we're gonna do is
07:03 - we're gonna seek the beginning of this
07:05 - stream which is this bytes iostream
07:06 - again I'm not going to talk about this
07:07 - stuff too much we're gonna open up the
07:09 - image that's there and then what we're
07:12 - gonna do is try to display this image
07:14 - using matplotlib and that's what this
07:16 - part does right here now after this
07:18 - we're just printing out to make sure
07:19 - that our image is indeed working and
07:21 - then finally so if we break out of this
07:24 - loop or something goes wrong in this try
07:25 - statement we're just gonna close the
07:27 - connection and close the server and
07:29 - that's how easy this service script is
07:30 - now now over to our Raspberry Pi so if
07:35 - we go to our Raspberry Pi and I'm just
07:36 - gonna make this fullscreen like that
07:40 - will read through this script now we're
07:42 - just gonna import all the stuff at the
07:44 - beginning similar as to before we're
07:45 - gonna set up a socket and we're going to
07:48 - set up the connection so again using our
07:50 - IP address and port 8000 that's just a
07:53 - default port can change that if you'd
07:54 - like and now we're gonna create a file
07:57 - object on our socket essentially but
08:00 - instead of reading we are going to write
08:02 - to it and that's what WB stands for I
08:04 - believe this stands for right bytes now
08:07 - what we're gonna do is try to open up
08:09 - our PI camera and this is where you're
08:10 - gonna set up your resolution and if you
08:12 - need to flip the camera which I've done
08:14 - using a vertical flip you can set your
08:16 - resolution right here so I have mine at
08:17 - 500 by 480 now notice that the smaller
08:21 - your resolution
08:23 - the faster your image is going to come
08:25 - in so if you try to set this at 1080p
08:27 - it's gonna take a lot longer to stream
08:30 - this image data to the other computer
08:31 - because it's essentially sending eight
08:34 - times the bytes at least I'm pretty sure
08:37 - that's what it works out too if you go
08:38 - to 1080p from this or something like
08:40 - that so anyways the smaller your
08:42 - resolution the faster the image you get
08:43 - but obviously the lowest quality now
08:46 - down here what we're gonna do is
08:47 - actually just set up a timer and what we
08:50 - were doing this is because we're only
08:51 - going to run the stream for 60 seconds
08:53 - now if you don't want to
08:55 - on the stream for a limited amount of
08:57 - time which is what I'm doing you can
08:58 - simply remove this line of code right
09:00 - here which says if time time - start is
09:04 - greater than 60 and essentially what
09:06 - this is doing is checking to see if the
09:07 - stream has been running for over 60
09:08 - seconds if it does it just closes it I
09:11 - just have that there to make sure I
09:12 - don't have like the stream infinitely
09:15 - going but again you guys can remove that
09:16 - if you like and change that to be
09:18 - whatever time you want now in here what
09:21 - we're doing is simply writing to a file
09:23 - object which is a bytes stream I'm not
09:26 - gonna talk about how that really works
09:27 - using the continuous capture from our
09:30 - camera and then we're just kind of doing
09:32 - some stuff with the stream here writing
09:34 - it to the connection and then again here
09:36 - if we get any issues we're going to
09:37 - close the connection and close the
09:38 - socket and that is essentially how this
09:41 - works so this is a cool way to stream
09:44 - image data I know that it's not super
09:46 - fast FPS but it's really useful because
09:48 - you get the actual image in Python code
09:50 - which is what a lot of other tutorials
09:52 - don't show you how to do again most of
09:54 - this code is right from the Raspberry Pi
09:56 - documentation I've just modified it
09:58 - slightly like only a few lines really
10:00 - and just kind of walked you guys through
10:02 - it so you understand how this works so
10:03 - with that being said I hope you guys
10:05 - enjoyed this video I hope you can start
10:07 - streaming your Raspberry Pi camera
10:08 - information and I'd be interested to
10:10 - know what you guys are doing with this
10:11 - so let me know in the comment down below

hey guys and welcome back to another Raspberry Pi video now in today's video what I'm gonna be doing is showing you how to stream data using Python sockets so purely with Python code there's nothing

pip now after you've done that we're gonna type ipconfig in our console here in our command prompt and it should pop up something that looks like this now what we're looking for here is our ipv4

like the stream infinitely going but again you guys can remove that if you like and change that to be whatever time you want now in here what we're doing is simply writing to a file object which is a
