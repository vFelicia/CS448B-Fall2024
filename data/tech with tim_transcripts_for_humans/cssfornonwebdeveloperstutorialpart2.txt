00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to part two
00:10 - of this css for non-web developers
00:13 - series in the last video i gave you a
00:15 - pretty long but hopefully fairly
00:17 - comprehensive overview of kind of the
00:18 - core css properties you should know and
00:21 - kind of be memorizing if you want to be
00:23 - efficient at writing css now in this
00:26 - video i want to actually take all of
00:27 - that theory all of that knowledge and
00:29 - apply that by building out kind of a
00:31 - basic layout and showing you how we
00:33 - would nest different flexboxes inside of
00:35 - each other how we would align items how
00:37 - we would just kind of create something
00:39 - by looking at a visual so i'll walk you
00:41 - through my thought process on doing that
00:43 - and show you kind of how we design that
00:44 - basic layout i'm hoping this shouldn't
00:46 - take too long um but yeah that's that's
00:49 - kind of what we're doing so what i'm
00:50 - actually going to be doing is designing
00:51 - a component from the programming expert
00:53 - website so if you guys don't know i have
00:54 - a course it's called programming expert
00:56 - if you are not interested in web
00:58 - development but you want to learn python
00:59 - goaling software design software
01:01 - engineering tools there's all kinds of
01:03 - stuff here i mean i'm on the website
01:04 - right now then definitely check it out i
01:07 - think this is great value for people
01:08 - looking to get better at programming if
01:10 - you want you can use discount code tim
01:12 - however i thought okay well it would be
01:13 - kind of a cool idea to just design one
01:15 - of these components from the programming
01:17 - expert website um again i mean i haven't
01:20 - actually made this i wasn't the one who
01:21 - coded like the ui for this website i
01:23 - just did the content so i'm kind of
01:24 - doing this from scratch if you will
01:27 - anyways what we're going to build is
01:28 - kind of this right here
01:30 - which is like one of the cards for one
01:32 - of the sections so i'm going to show you
01:34 - know how we do the header how we do
01:35 - everything laid out how we have these
01:37 - kind of things inside how we add a
01:39 - shadow how we have a hover effect for a
01:40 - button uh how we have images beside each
01:43 - other you know it seems pretty simple
01:44 - but when you actually think about
01:45 - building out this layout if you're not
01:47 - familiar with css this can look a little
01:49 - bit intimidating if we want it to look
01:51 - exactly like this so that's what i'm
01:53 - going to try to do with the exception of
01:54 - the progress bar which we're not going
01:56 - to add
01:57 - okay so let's uh let's try that then
01:59 - let's put this on the right hand side of
02:00 - my screen i have my html document here i
02:03 - have html and css excuse me at times you
02:06 - probably won't be able to see both of
02:07 - them just because you know it's not
02:09 - really enough screen real estate for
02:10 - that but let's start by by trying to
02:12 - design this and we'll try to make it
02:14 - responsive as well so that it kind of
02:16 - looks like this on this screen size
02:18 - right
02:19 - so the first thing i usually do
02:21 - is kind of just build out the html
02:24 - layout myself i start adding classes to
02:26 - it and then i go style it after um you
02:29 - know there's times when i'll style
02:30 - before but usually i like to just get
02:31 - all the content on the page and then
02:33 - once the content's there we can kind of
02:34 - lay it out how we need to
02:36 - so let's begin by creating a div
02:39 - in this div will be kind of the card i'm
02:41 - going to call this white thing like a
02:43 - card on the page and then that way we
02:44 - could reuse this div and make multiple
02:46 - cards and see how those are kind of laid
02:48 - out so i'm going to say class is equal
02:50 - to card
02:51 - okay so that's div 1 that's going to be
02:53 - the container for everything inside of
02:55 - this div we need a header so let's have
02:57 - an h1 tag
02:58 - let's say class
03:00 - is equal to
03:02 - header text and then this is going to be
03:05 - two dash programming
03:08 - fundamentals
03:10 - uh is that how you spell it yeah
03:11 - fundamentals like that okay uh after we
03:14 - have that we have kind of three icons of
03:17 - sorts let me just make these a little
03:18 - bit larger so we can see
03:19 - so we have you know 17 hours 25 videos
03:22 - 131 practice questions and i see
03:23 - immediately that i'm going to probably
03:25 - need these in some kind of row right
03:26 - because they need to be kind of aligned
03:28 - with each other if i just put 3p tags
03:30 - they're going to be block style and
03:31 - they're not really going to work very
03:32 - well so what i'm going to do is make a
03:34 - div
03:35 - and i'm going to say class is equal to
03:37 - and let's just call this stats or
03:39 - something i mean the naming is not super
03:40 - important right now because we don't
03:41 - have a lot of content so i'll just call
03:43 - this the stats
03:45 - container
03:46 - okay
03:48 - now inside of here i'm now going to make
03:50 - three divs one for each of these kind of
03:52 - things because we're going to have the
03:54 - logo or like the little emblem and then
03:56 - the text and i think i should kind of
03:58 - keep those in a container so that we can
04:01 - then space them out differently
04:03 - from from the text itself there's a
04:06 - bunch of different ways to do this by
04:06 - the way so don't think that how i'm
04:08 - doing this is the only way you can
04:09 - challenge yourself to do this as well
04:11 - so let's say class is equal to and let's
04:14 - say stat item like that
04:17 - now i'll make three of these because
04:18 - we're going to have three stat items and
04:20 - inside of the stat item container i want
04:22 - to have a paragraph tag
04:24 - this first one will be 17 hours
04:27 - and my icon which i will show you how we
04:29 - can add that in a second
04:31 - okay so 17 hours
04:33 - uh we're gonna have 25 videos let's say
04:37 - 25 videos and then 131 practice
04:40 - questions so
04:42 - practice
04:44 - questions like that
04:45 - okay and then of course again we need
04:47 - that icon but again i will i will add
04:48 - that later all right so we have this div
04:50 - now outside of this div we're going to
04:52 - have our description so let's make a p
04:54 - tag i'll say class is equal to
04:56 - description like that i spell that
04:58 - correctly i believe i did and we just
05:00 - copy this
05:01 - and dump this here inside of the
05:03 - description
05:04 - okay
05:05 - beyond the description we have these
05:07 - things right so we have kind of this i
05:09 - don't know i don't know what you want to
05:10 - call this
05:11 - button container
05:12 - you know pressable item
05:14 - i'll just call it
05:16 - a graycard or something i don't really
05:17 - know what we would want to call that so
05:19 - let's say
05:20 - div
05:21 - like that
05:23 - slash div by the way notice how whenever
05:25 - i open a tag i close it right away
05:27 - usually just makes sure i don't forget
05:29 - that to close the tag so that's why i'm
05:30 - doing that i'm going to say class is
05:32 - equal to and let's say gray
05:34 - container now we're going to need two of
05:36 - those gray containers so let's just copy
05:38 - them here and we'll use the same class
05:39 - name right because they're going to have
05:40 - the same styles now inside of the gray
05:42 - container let's make this a bit larger
05:44 - so we can kind of analyze how it would
05:45 - look in the proper format we're going to
05:47 - have a button we're going to have
05:49 - another like logo of some sort and then
05:51 - we're gonna have the text so i'll just
05:52 - put those in there and then we'll wrap
05:54 - them in some kind of div uh later on let
05:56 - me just close this for right now
05:58 - okay so let's make
05:59 - a
06:00 - uh
06:01 - i guess we'll make this like an h3 tag
06:03 - and we can just say
06:05 - lessons and then copy this
06:09 - and this will be assessment
06:12 - okay
06:13 - assessment like that
06:15 - okay and then we need a button
06:18 - so let's say button and class will be
06:21 - equal to we can just call this button
06:23 - and for this one we'll say
06:25 - class is equal to
06:27 - um
06:28 - sub header
06:30 - okay that's fine just copy this and put
06:32 - that here and then for the button this
06:35 - needs to say resume
06:37 - and then we'll just add an arrow
06:40 - okay
06:41 - nice so we've just built out pretty well
06:43 - the content for this right now of course
06:44 - when we look at this you know actually
06:46 - doesn't even look that bad to be honest
06:48 - obviously it's not looking like this
06:49 - card but we kind of have all the content
06:51 - that we need and now we need to lay
06:52 - everything out now we also want to add
06:53 - some icons uh and i'm gonna show you how
06:55 - we add kind of these little icons by
06:57 - using something called font awesome let
06:59 - me load that up and then i'll show you
07:00 - how we have that okay so in front of me
07:02 - i have something called font awesome now
07:03 - font awesome is just kind of a free cdn
07:06 - that lets you use kind of pre-built
07:08 - icons now the way it works is you need
07:10 - to enter your email and then kind of
07:12 - create an account and once you do that
07:14 - it will give you access to a cdn and
07:17 - anyways you could just follow this
07:18 - website it's very straightforward but
07:19 - essentially it involves just copying a
07:21 - tag into the head of your html document
07:23 - once that tag is in there you can then
07:25 - use some predefined class names like i'm
07:27 - going to show you
07:28 - to use some predefined icons so go to
07:30 - this website fontawesome.com i'll try to
07:32 - leave it in the description someone
07:33 - remind me if i forget and download or
07:36 - get access to your cdn copy that into
07:38 - your head tag it should give you the
07:40 - instructions on how to do that and then
07:41 - you can start accessing the different
07:43 - icons
07:44 - okay so
07:45 - let me start using this now so for the
07:49 - icons i'm just going to copy in mine
07:51 - which is this i mean i guess you could
07:53 - copy mine as well but
07:54 - i don't know exactly how that works if
07:56 - i'm going to get rate limited or
07:57 - something and now the way that you add
07:59 - an icon
08:01 - is you do the following you go here you
08:03 - go i
08:05 - and i kind of stands for icon the tag
08:07 - and then you say class is equal to and
08:10 - then you write the class of the icon now
08:12 - i'm just going to pull up a cheat sheet
08:13 - here and find the different icons so i
08:15 - have to search for them okay so the
08:16 - first one actually i'm just going to
08:17 - copy this in
08:18 - is going to be f a f a clock dash o
08:21 - arya hidden is going to be true okay
08:24 - next one
08:25 - this is going to be f a video
08:29 - okay i'm just trying to get one that
08:30 - looks similar to the the programming
08:32 - extra ones here and then i think this is
08:34 - just f a
08:35 - pencil and then we also need two icons
08:38 - for this
08:40 - so let me grab those
08:41 - okay i'm just going to copy them in here
08:44 - so
08:45 - go lessons we're going to have fa solid
08:47 - f8 clapperboard and then
08:51 - i'm going to have this one here
08:53 - which is fa solid fa file lines they
08:55 - won't look exactly the same but they
08:56 - should be good enough okay so there you
08:58 - go we can see our icons are kind of
09:00 - showing up here obviously nothing's
09:02 - really laid out how we want it to be so
09:03 - now that's what we need to do now one
09:06 - thing i don't know why these are getting
09:08 - like why is lessons getting um
09:11 - highlighted like that all right so i was
09:13 - kind of tripping out there for a second
09:14 - i just forgot to close one of my icon
09:15 - tags so it was like messing up the whole
09:17 - document and showing it like a bunch of
09:19 - times uh anyways i just i closed it here
09:21 - so now that that looks good okay so
09:22 - let's just go back here and figure out
09:24 - what we want to do first so i probably
09:26 - want to start with the exterior
09:27 - container that's usually what i do set
09:29 - its color um set like a little box
09:31 - shadow for it i guess a border of some
09:33 - sort kind of the interior margin and
09:36 - then once i have that i will go with the
09:38 - rest so the first thing i need to do is
09:40 - kind of color the card so let's open up
09:42 - our styles here
09:44 - okay
09:45 - just close that and go split right
09:49 - here and we have card
09:51 - so i'm going to say doc card and the
09:53 - first thing i'm going to do is say
09:54 - background color i'm going to set that
09:55 - to white
09:57 - now i'm also going to say margin
09:58 - i'm just going to add a 5 margin here
10:01 - and that will be 5 margin based on the
10:04 - height of the body now what i also want
10:07 - to do is just add a background color to
10:08 - the body here so we actually see the uh
10:10 - the background color of the card so i'm
10:13 - going to say background color and then
10:15 - this will be
10:17 - light gray
10:18 - and now we can actually see the card
10:20 - okay
10:21 - next i'm going to
10:23 - make the body 100 height so we're going
10:26 - to say
10:27 - height
10:28 - 100 vertical height just so that my
10:30 - margin now is going to be based on the
10:33 - height of the screen uh not based on
10:36 - just the body content okay
10:38 - continuing i want to add some rounded
10:40 - edges here for the card now to do that
10:43 - there is a property called border radius
10:46 - and i'll just set this to be 5 pixels
10:48 - and now we have kind of some rounded
10:49 - edges
10:50 - now the next thing i want to do is add a
10:52 - little bit of a shadow here so i'm going
10:53 - to say box
10:55 - shadow
10:56 - now for the box shadow i don't remember
10:58 - all of the properties for this but i
10:59 - believe you do the offset in the x y
11:02 - direction and then the color so i'm
11:03 - going to say one pixel one pixel and
11:06 - then rgba
11:08 - and then zero zero zero and zero point
11:12 - nine so we have some kind of opacity
11:15 - okay and then you see i'm getting a bit
11:17 - of a shadow however i want to kind of
11:18 - blur this shadow so i'm going to add one
11:20 - more property here which is 5 pixels and
11:22 - now notice i kind of get a blur around
11:24 - this and i'm also going to change the
11:25 - opacity to be like 0.7 so it's not quite
11:28 - as thick
11:30 - however i also want to get this box
11:32 - shadow on the other side because right
11:34 - now it's kind of heavily on the bottom
11:36 - right based on the way i've done it
11:38 - so the way you do this and i apologize
11:40 - that it's kind of hard to see here is
11:42 - you copy this
11:43 - you put a comma and then you put it
11:45 - again and then it should do this in the
11:48 - opposite direction but i need to change
11:49 - these now to be negative so negative 2
11:51 - pixels negative 2 pixels and now notice
11:54 - i'm getting a shadow kind of on all
11:55 - sides
11:56 - there might be a better way to do this
11:57 - but this is the way that i'm familiar
11:58 - with so that's what we'll go with for
12:00 - now and again the opacity is very very
12:02 - thick so let's go with 0.5
12:05 - and make it a little a little more
12:07 - blurred there
12:08 - okay i think that's uh that's fine for
12:10 - now
12:11 - all right so now that we have that
12:14 - uh let's make this a bit smaller just so
12:16 - we can see this a little bit easier i
12:18 - want to
12:19 - make it so that there is kind of margin
12:20 - within the card right so if we go here
12:23 - obviously these items are not hitting
12:25 - the the card there's some margin between
12:27 - them so how are we going to do that well
12:28 - we're going to add another div inside of
12:31 - here and then add margin to it so this
12:33 - is a common practice what you'll do is
12:34 - you'll have kind of a main container and
12:36 - then you'll have an interior container
12:38 - and that interior container will kind of
12:40 - be
12:41 - have a margin to the the outside
12:43 - container now i also just realized
12:45 - though that we can probably just add
12:46 - padding to the card and avoid doing that
12:48 - so let's try that there's many different
12:50 - ways to do stuff here in css so let's
12:51 - say padding
12:52 - let's just go with 10 pixels and it's
12:55 - because i didn't have a semicolon here
12:57 - so let's add that and notice when i add
12:58 - my 10 pixels of padding now it actually
13:00 - pads the content inside however i want
13:03 - kind of the same padding on top and
13:04 - bottom so i'm going to say
13:07 - 5 pixels 10 pixels
13:10 - 5 pixels 10 pixels so that it looks a
13:13 - little less extreme on the vertical
13:15 - padding but we still have the same
13:16 - horizontal padding that we wanted before
13:19 - okay so that's actually good right now
13:20 - for the kind of container of the card
13:24 - going here now we want to lay these out
13:25 - in a row and kind of change this this
13:27 - font style so it looks a little bit
13:28 - nicer so for the font let's just say
13:31 - font family
13:33 - and we'll set this just to
13:35 - i don't know what do we want to have
13:37 - here
13:38 - uh let's set it to this that looks fine
13:40 - to me for now
13:41 - i don't really care to to pick the font
13:43 - and actually why is there so many
13:45 - let's just set it to arial yeah ariel is
13:47 - fine okay so font family will be ariel
13:49 - when i set that on the body it will set
13:50 - for all of the other elements so that's
13:51 - why i'm doing that all right now we want
13:53 - to lay these out
13:55 - um
13:56 - what do you call this
13:57 - want to lay out these these items here
13:59 - so they're in the correct position so
14:01 - the first thing i want to do is make it
14:02 - so this icon is beside my text so the
14:05 - way i'm going to do that is i'm going to
14:07 - first look for what i need to change
14:08 - which is going to be stat item so i want
14:10 - the stat item to be a
14:12 - flexbox essentially that has the
14:14 - items laid out layout laid out sorry
14:17 - horizontally so let's say stat
14:20 - item
14:23 - if we could get that correctly and this
14:25 - will be f
14:26 - display
14:29 - flex
14:30 - okay when i make that display flex now
14:32 - they are aligned in a row now the next
14:35 - thing i need to do is say align items
14:38 - center so now i'm going to align on the
14:40 - vertical axis the cross axis in the
14:42 - center
14:43 - okay now that i've done that let's add a
14:44 - gap between the items of five pixel and
14:48 - now they're kind of spaced out a little
14:49 - bit so that's nice and actually let's
14:50 - just do one em
14:52 - as the spacing just so that that will
14:54 - kind of scale with the font size
14:56 - all right that's nice now for our text
14:58 - within the stat item container i want it
15:00 - to be bold so i'm going to say stat item
15:02 - p
15:03 - and i'll say font weight and this will
15:05 - be bold like that
15:08 - i could add a strong tag but i think
15:09 - it's better to do it in css styling so
15:11 - that's how i'm going to do it and just
15:12 - to show you how that works
15:13 - now that these are laid out properly i
15:15 - would like to change the color of my
15:17 - icons so to do that again i can say stat
15:20 - item and then i can say i
15:23 - and i can say that my color
15:27 - is red and now i've changed my icon
15:29 - color to be red
15:30 - now i also want to have
15:32 - some padding or
15:34 - kind of like a box around my icons so
15:38 - there's a few ways to do this again but
15:39 - let's do the following
15:42 - let's say padding
15:43 - 10 pixels okay and that's going to pad
15:46 - the uh what is it the content box here
15:49 - then i'm going to say my background
15:51 - color is and let's just go with red
15:53 - alright so
15:55 - that's fine but i would like
15:59 - it to be transparent so we're going to
16:01 - say
16:02 - let's do it in hex this time ff000
16:07 - and now we have kind of this transparent
16:09 - box around and then i'm going to say my
16:12 - border radius
16:14 - is 5 pixel all right so that kind of now
16:17 - matches up with what programming expert
16:18 - one had my boxes are slightly different
16:20 - size because it's sizing based on the
16:22 - icon size but that's fine i won't get
16:24 - that picky right now okay so already
16:27 - looking much better
16:28 - the next thing i need to do now is lay
16:30 - all these out in a row so i see i have
16:32 - my stats container so i'm just going to
16:34 - now apply flex styling to my stats
16:36 - container so i'm going to say stats
16:37 - container
16:39 - i'm going to say display
16:41 - and then flex
16:43 - okay and now automatically they're going
16:45 - to go into row now we need some gap so
16:48 - let's say gap be 1em
16:50 - and there we go and then i will
16:53 - align items
16:55 - in the center
16:57 - and i will justify content flex start
17:00 - so now let's make this a bit bigger
17:01 - and this is looking good okay so
17:04 - good looking card so far of course
17:06 - obviously we got to add these down below
17:07 - but if we go look at this uh you know
17:09 - we're not too far off
17:11 - somewhat from uh from what the layout's
17:13 - looking like
17:14 - let's look at that
17:16 - we might want more a slightly more of a
17:18 - margin there but
17:19 - for now that's fine okay so let's add
17:21 - more of a margin on our
17:24 - uh interior padding so
17:27 - let's go 10
17:29 - 15
17:31 - 10 15.
17:32 - now we just squish it in a little bit
17:34 - more that looks a bit nicer
17:35 - all right
17:37 - continuing we now need to handle the
17:38 - bottom uh of of what we need here so the
17:42 - bottom section is our gray container
17:45 - so let's start with that and then we can
17:46 - do what's inside of the container
17:48 - all right so let's say dot gray
17:52 - container
17:54 - okay background color
17:57 - will be
17:59 - light gray
18:01 - all right and then we want to add a
18:04 - border radius so border radius of 5
18:07 - pixels add some rounded edges here
18:11 - okay so now we have our rounded edges
18:13 - now that we need to align the items
18:14 - within the gray container so i'm going
18:16 - to say display
18:18 - flex
18:19 - okay and now we've aligned on row that's
18:22 - good but we want to push the button to
18:24 - the right hand side and keep the icon
18:27 - and the text on the left hand side right
18:29 - so if you look here we have kind of if
18:31 - we make this larger
18:33 - this kind of stays on the left hand side
18:34 - and then the button gets pushed to the
18:35 - right so we'll do that with flexbox
18:38 - let's not minimize that let's put that
18:40 - over here
18:41 - the way we will do that
18:43 - is
18:44 - we'll change this slightly so we have
18:46 - three items here now what i want to do
18:47 - is i want to use the property space
18:49 - between when i use space between it's
18:51 - going to push my items out with the
18:52 - space between now the issue is since i
18:54 - have three items if i do space between
18:56 - right now and actually i mean we might
18:58 - as well just add it because we're going
18:59 - to add it anyways let's say justify
19:00 - content
19:01 - space
19:03 - not around space between
19:05 - you'll see that we get them kind of all
19:06 - aligned right i don't want lessons in
19:08 - the middle i want this pushed to the
19:10 - left so the way i have to fix that is i
19:12 - have to make it so i only have two items
19:13 - here so to do that i will now take my i
19:17 - and my lessons wrap those in a div and
19:20 - then by wrapping those in a div the two
19:21 - direct flex items will be the div and
19:24 - the button so the contents of the div
19:26 - will push to the left and then the
19:27 - button will be pushed to the right
19:30 - hopefully that makes a bit of sense i
19:31 - don't even need to give this a class
19:33 - right now i just need to wrap it in a
19:34 - div and when i do that we get pushed to
19:37 - left right
19:38 - so let's say
19:40 - div
19:41 - div now i will add a class because as
19:43 - you can see
19:44 - since i have my h3 tag which is display
19:46 - block i'm going down what i want to do
19:49 - instead is i want to push them so
19:51 - they're on the same line so to do that
19:53 - we'll add our class
19:55 - and we'll say
19:57 - class is equal to i'll just call this
19:59 - left for right now
20:01 - okay
20:03 - now let's go here and add our left so
20:05 - we're going to say dot left
20:08 - okay and then this is going to be
20:10 - display
20:12 - flex
20:13 - like that and now they are
20:16 - kind of pushed together however again
20:18 - we're having this issue where this icon
20:20 - here right
20:22 - is uh not in line with lessons so to fix
20:24 - that we just say
20:26 - uh align items
20:28 - and then this is going to be center and
20:30 - now we've aligned them now of course the
20:31 - problem is we want some padding here and
20:33 - some margins so let's add that we're
20:34 - going to say gap
20:36 - 5 pixels now we're separating slightly
20:38 - from the icon which is what we wanted
20:40 - okay so that's going well
20:43 - continuing we want to style the button
20:45 - we want to add some space now between
20:47 - our two gray containers
20:48 - and how are we going to do that well
20:50 - there's multiple ways to add space
20:51 - between the gray containers the first
20:53 - way is just to add a margin bottom
20:55 - property
20:56 - or alternatively a margin top property
20:58 - so i'll show you the first way if i do
21:00 - something like margin dash top of let's
21:03 - say five percent now you see that we
21:05 - just have a five percent gap based on
21:06 - the height of this card um between the
21:09 - items now the reason why you may not
21:11 - want to do that is because that adds
21:12 - five percent margin to both of these not
21:15 - just the assessment one right because
21:17 - you have the same class for both so now
21:19 - you're getting five percent margin from
21:21 - the description tag now i actually don't
21:23 - think that's too bad but then you see
21:25 - when you do something like this okay
21:27 - well now five percent looks really
21:28 - really big right so maybe we don't want
21:30 - to use five percent maybe we want to use
21:31 - something else so rather than five
21:33 - percent maybe we just do
21:35 - one em
21:36 - and now we'll have the same amount of
21:37 - margin no matter how big the size is and
21:39 - that looks fine to me
21:41 - uh okay yeah that's that's good for for
21:44 - right now uh okay looks good
21:46 - all right so actually let's just leave
21:48 - the margin top of 1em and i'll show you
21:51 - if you change this to bottom now you
21:52 - just get some margin at the bottom right
21:54 - so you're getting a margin of this plus
21:57 - the margin of the original content
21:59 - so just to continue this there's a lot
22:01 - of stuff to go through here if i now
22:03 - change my margin bottom which is this to
22:06 - be
22:06 - zero pixels um
22:09 - okay no actually i don't want to do that
22:11 - um
22:13 - okay i don't know where i was going with
22:14 - that anyways you get the point the point
22:15 - is we have you know the padding here
22:17 - right for the card padding the content
22:19 - but then we also have added a margin
22:21 - here so you're getting a little bit of a
22:22 - weird kind of layout thing going because
22:24 - we have margin bottom on on both of
22:25 - these uh these classes
22:27 - anyways that's fine for now okay so this
22:29 - is looking good now we want to style the
22:30 - button and we want to just push
22:31 - everything in a bit so let's go to our
22:33 - great container and let's add some
22:34 - padding with the content so let's just
22:36 - say padding dash left
22:38 - 10 pixels okay and then we'll just do
22:41 - the same thing on padding right
22:44 - and rather than pixels uh just to keep
22:46 - it a bit more dynamic let's go 1em
22:49 - and uh and one em here as well
22:52 - now i'm just doing that because i don't
22:53 - really care about the padding vertically
22:54 - at least right now but once i resize the
22:56 - button i will probably add the same
22:58 - padding actually everywhere so let's
22:59 - just say padding
23:01 - 1em uh like
23:03 - like that
23:04 - okay yeah so that looks a bit better so
23:06 - let's now adjust our button so let's go
23:08 - here to button
23:11 - and it'll be dot button although i guess
23:13 - we could just directly access the button
23:15 - and let's change the color so let's say
23:17 - the background color of the button will
23:19 - be
23:20 - i guess
23:21 - navy
23:22 - and then we'll say the color of the text
23:25 - will be white and then we want to adjust
23:28 - the font size so i'm going to say font
23:29 - size be
23:31 - 20
23:32 - uh px
23:34 - okay so that's nice now we want a border
23:37 - radius on the button so it's a bit
23:38 - rounded so let's say 5 pixels
23:41 - okay
23:42 - that looks fine to me
23:44 - and then we want to remove the border so
23:46 - we're going to say border
23:47 - dash color
23:49 - and i'm just going to make that
23:50 - transparent and now that gets rid of our
23:51 - border all right so i know it's not
23:54 - quite the same color as this and we also
23:56 - probably want to make it a bit longer so
23:57 - let's do that by saying
23:59 - padding dash left
24:02 - 1em
24:04 - and padding dash right
24:08 - ym as well
24:09 - all right so now let's have a look at
24:11 - this and it's starting to look somewhat
24:13 - like this car now i know this cart takes
24:15 - up less less width on the screen but you
24:17 - get the idea we kind of have a general
24:18 - layout as opposed to the colors and
24:21 - and all of that
24:22 - okay so that looks good uh last thing
24:24 - i'll do is just add a hover effect here
24:25 - to the button
24:27 - and then
24:28 - i think we'll be pretty well good so
24:30 - let's go button let's go hover
24:34 - and let's change the background color
24:36 - just be blue
24:38 - so now when i hover
24:39 - there you go
24:40 - all right so let's
24:42 - now just add one more of these
24:44 - to the screen so let's copy the card
24:47 - we'll add some margin between the cards
24:49 - uh and actually oh they already have did
24:51 - i already add the margin on the card
24:52 - let's see where's my card oh yeah margin
24:54 - five percent so since i have margin of
24:56 - five percent they already have the
24:56 - margins that's what i need so you can
24:58 - see here i have my program fundamentals
25:00 - and then of course you know i get the
25:01 - same thing again
25:02 - and
25:04 - there you are so we have essentially
25:06 - created this i know it doesn't look
25:07 - exactly the same but you guys get the
25:08 - idea it's close enough for me and that
25:11 - hopefully showed you how you design kind
25:14 - of a responsive flexible layout and as i
25:17 - continue to change the size here these
25:18 - cards still make sense there is a
25:20 - minimum size i can't go any smaller
25:22 - based on the way that i've done this and
25:23 - everything should kind of automatically
25:25 - be scaling because of the way that i've
25:26 - used flexbox
25:29 - so
25:29 - with that said i think i will end the
25:32 - video here if you guys want to challenge
25:34 - yourself try to create some components
25:35 - on programming expert maybe buy it while
25:38 - you're at it you can use discount code
25:39 - tim with that said hope you enjoyed the
25:41 - video if you did make sure you hit like
25:42 - subscribe to the channel let me know if
25:44 - you want to see some more css content
25:45 - and i will see you in another youtube

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to part two of this css for nonweb developers series in the last video i gave you a pretty long but hopefully fairly comprehensive overview of kind of the core css properties you should know and kind of be memorizing if you want to be efficient at writing css now in this video i want to actually take all of that theory all of that knowledge and apply that by building out kind of a basic layout and showing you how we would nest different flexboxes inside of each other how we would align items how we would just kind of create something by looking at a visual so i'll walk you through my thought process on doing that and show you kind of how we design that basic layout i'm hoping this shouldn't take too long um but yeah that's that's kind of what we're doing so what i'm actually going to be doing is designing a component from the programming expert website so if you guys don't know i have a course it's called programming expert if you are not interested in web development but you want to learn python goaling software design software engineering tools there's all kinds of stuff here i mean i'm on the website right now then definitely check it out i think this is great value for people looking to get better at programming if you want you can use discount code tim however i thought okay well it would be kind of a cool idea to just design one of these components from the programming expert website um again i mean i haven't actually made this i wasn't the one who coded like the ui for this website i just did the content so i'm kind of doing this from scratch if you will anyways what we're going to build is kind of this right here which is like one of the cards for one of the sections so i'm going to show you know how we do the header how we do everything laid out how we have these kind of things inside how we add a shadow how we have a hover effect for a button uh how we have images beside each other you know it seems pretty simple but when you actually think about building out this layout if you're not familiar with css this can look a little bit intimidating if we want it to look exactly like this so that's what i'm going to try to do with the exception of the progress bar which we're not going to add okay so let's uh let's try that then let's put this on the right hand side of my screen i have my html document here i have html and css excuse me at times you probably won't be able to see both of them just because you know it's not really enough screen real estate for that but let's start by by trying to design this and we'll try to make it responsive as well so that it kind of looks like this on this screen size right so the first thing i usually do is kind of just build out the html layout myself i start adding classes to it and then i go style it after um you know there's times when i'll style before but usually i like to just get all the content on the page and then once the content's there we can kind of lay it out how we need to so let's begin by creating a div in this div will be kind of the card i'm going to call this white thing like a card on the page and then that way we could reuse this div and make multiple cards and see how those are kind of laid out so i'm going to say class is equal to card okay so that's div 1 that's going to be the container for everything inside of this div we need a header so let's have an h1 tag let's say class is equal to header text and then this is going to be two dash programming fundamentals uh is that how you spell it yeah fundamentals like that okay uh after we have that we have kind of three icons of sorts let me just make these a little bit larger so we can see so we have you know 17 hours 25 videos 131 practice questions and i see immediately that i'm going to probably need these in some kind of row right because they need to be kind of aligned with each other if i just put 3p tags they're going to be block style and they're not really going to work very well so what i'm going to do is make a div and i'm going to say class is equal to and let's just call this stats or something i mean the naming is not super important right now because we don't have a lot of content so i'll just call this the stats container okay now inside of here i'm now going to make three divs one for each of these kind of things because we're going to have the logo or like the little emblem and then the text and i think i should kind of keep those in a container so that we can then space them out differently from from the text itself there's a bunch of different ways to do this by the way so don't think that how i'm doing this is the only way you can challenge yourself to do this as well so let's say class is equal to and let's say stat item like that now i'll make three of these because we're going to have three stat items and inside of the stat item container i want to have a paragraph tag this first one will be 17 hours and my icon which i will show you how we can add that in a second okay so 17 hours uh we're gonna have 25 videos let's say 25 videos and then 131 practice questions so practice questions like that okay and then of course again we need that icon but again i will i will add that later all right so we have this div now outside of this div we're going to have our description so let's make a p tag i'll say class is equal to description like that i spell that correctly i believe i did and we just copy this and dump this here inside of the description okay beyond the description we have these things right so we have kind of this i don't know i don't know what you want to call this button container you know pressable item i'll just call it a graycard or something i don't really know what we would want to call that so let's say div like that slash div by the way notice how whenever i open a tag i close it right away usually just makes sure i don't forget that to close the tag so that's why i'm doing that i'm going to say class is equal to and let's say gray container now we're going to need two of those gray containers so let's just copy them here and we'll use the same class name right because they're going to have the same styles now inside of the gray container let's make this a bit larger so we can kind of analyze how it would look in the proper format we're going to have a button we're going to have another like logo of some sort and then we're gonna have the text so i'll just put those in there and then we'll wrap them in some kind of div uh later on let me just close this for right now okay so let's make a uh i guess we'll make this like an h3 tag and we can just say lessons and then copy this and this will be assessment okay assessment like that okay and then we need a button so let's say button and class will be equal to we can just call this button and for this one we'll say class is equal to um sub header okay that's fine just copy this and put that here and then for the button this needs to say resume and then we'll just add an arrow okay nice so we've just built out pretty well the content for this right now of course when we look at this you know actually doesn't even look that bad to be honest obviously it's not looking like this card but we kind of have all the content that we need and now we need to lay everything out now we also want to add some icons uh and i'm gonna show you how we add kind of these little icons by using something called font awesome let me load that up and then i'll show you how we have that okay so in front of me i have something called font awesome now font awesome is just kind of a free cdn that lets you use kind of prebuilt icons now the way it works is you need to enter your email and then kind of create an account and once you do that it will give you access to a cdn and anyways you could just follow this website it's very straightforward but essentially it involves just copying a tag into the head of your html document once that tag is in there you can then use some predefined class names like i'm going to show you to use some predefined icons so go to this website fontawesome.com i'll try to leave it in the description someone remind me if i forget and download or get access to your cdn copy that into your head tag it should give you the instructions on how to do that and then you can start accessing the different icons okay so let me start using this now so for the icons i'm just going to copy in mine which is this i mean i guess you could copy mine as well but i don't know exactly how that works if i'm going to get rate limited or something and now the way that you add an icon is you do the following you go here you go i and i kind of stands for icon the tag and then you say class is equal to and then you write the class of the icon now i'm just going to pull up a cheat sheet here and find the different icons so i have to search for them okay so the first one actually i'm just going to copy this in is going to be f a f a clock dash o arya hidden is going to be true okay next one this is going to be f a video okay i'm just trying to get one that looks similar to the the programming extra ones here and then i think this is just f a pencil and then we also need two icons for this so let me grab those okay i'm just going to copy them in here so go lessons we're going to have fa solid f8 clapperboard and then i'm going to have this one here which is fa solid fa file lines they won't look exactly the same but they should be good enough okay so there you go we can see our icons are kind of showing up here obviously nothing's really laid out how we want it to be so now that's what we need to do now one thing i don't know why these are getting like why is lessons getting um highlighted like that all right so i was kind of tripping out there for a second i just forgot to close one of my icon tags so it was like messing up the whole document and showing it like a bunch of times uh anyways i just i closed it here so now that that looks good okay so let's just go back here and figure out what we want to do first so i probably want to start with the exterior container that's usually what i do set its color um set like a little box shadow for it i guess a border of some sort kind of the interior margin and then once i have that i will go with the rest so the first thing i need to do is kind of color the card so let's open up our styles here okay just close that and go split right here and we have card so i'm going to say doc card and the first thing i'm going to do is say background color i'm going to set that to white now i'm also going to say margin i'm just going to add a 5 margin here and that will be 5 margin based on the height of the body now what i also want to do is just add a background color to the body here so we actually see the uh the background color of the card so i'm going to say background color and then this will be light gray and now we can actually see the card okay next i'm going to make the body 100 height so we're going to say height 100 vertical height just so that my margin now is going to be based on the height of the screen uh not based on just the body content okay continuing i want to add some rounded edges here for the card now to do that there is a property called border radius and i'll just set this to be 5 pixels and now we have kind of some rounded edges now the next thing i want to do is add a little bit of a shadow here so i'm going to say box shadow now for the box shadow i don't remember all of the properties for this but i believe you do the offset in the x y direction and then the color so i'm going to say one pixel one pixel and then rgba and then zero zero zero and zero point nine so we have some kind of opacity okay and then you see i'm getting a bit of a shadow however i want to kind of blur this shadow so i'm going to add one more property here which is 5 pixels and now notice i kind of get a blur around this and i'm also going to change the opacity to be like 0.7 so it's not quite as thick however i also want to get this box shadow on the other side because right now it's kind of heavily on the bottom right based on the way i've done it so the way you do this and i apologize that it's kind of hard to see here is you copy this you put a comma and then you put it again and then it should do this in the opposite direction but i need to change these now to be negative so negative 2 pixels negative 2 pixels and now notice i'm getting a shadow kind of on all sides there might be a better way to do this but this is the way that i'm familiar with so that's what we'll go with for now and again the opacity is very very thick so let's go with 0.5 and make it a little a little more blurred there okay i think that's uh that's fine for now all right so now that we have that uh let's make this a bit smaller just so we can see this a little bit easier i want to make it so that there is kind of margin within the card right so if we go here obviously these items are not hitting the the card there's some margin between them so how are we going to do that well we're going to add another div inside of here and then add margin to it so this is a common practice what you'll do is you'll have kind of a main container and then you'll have an interior container and that interior container will kind of be have a margin to the the outside container now i also just realized though that we can probably just add padding to the card and avoid doing that so let's try that there's many different ways to do stuff here in css so let's say padding let's just go with 10 pixels and it's because i didn't have a semicolon here so let's add that and notice when i add my 10 pixels of padding now it actually pads the content inside however i want kind of the same padding on top and bottom so i'm going to say 5 pixels 10 pixels 5 pixels 10 pixels so that it looks a little less extreme on the vertical padding but we still have the same horizontal padding that we wanted before okay so that's actually good right now for the kind of container of the card going here now we want to lay these out in a row and kind of change this this font style so it looks a little bit nicer so for the font let's just say font family and we'll set this just to i don't know what do we want to have here uh let's set it to this that looks fine to me for now i don't really care to to pick the font and actually why is there so many let's just set it to arial yeah ariel is fine okay so font family will be ariel when i set that on the body it will set for all of the other elements so that's why i'm doing that all right now we want to lay these out um what do you call this want to lay out these these items here so they're in the correct position so the first thing i want to do is make it so this icon is beside my text so the way i'm going to do that is i'm going to first look for what i need to change which is going to be stat item so i want the stat item to be a flexbox essentially that has the items laid out layout laid out sorry horizontally so let's say stat item if we could get that correctly and this will be f display flex okay when i make that display flex now they are aligned in a row now the next thing i need to do is say align items center so now i'm going to align on the vertical axis the cross axis in the center okay now that i've done that let's add a gap between the items of five pixel and now they're kind of spaced out a little bit so that's nice and actually let's just do one em as the spacing just so that that will kind of scale with the font size all right that's nice now for our text within the stat item container i want it to be bold so i'm going to say stat item p and i'll say font weight and this will be bold like that i could add a strong tag but i think it's better to do it in css styling so that's how i'm going to do it and just to show you how that works now that these are laid out properly i would like to change the color of my icons so to do that again i can say stat item and then i can say i and i can say that my color is red and now i've changed my icon color to be red now i also want to have some padding or kind of like a box around my icons so there's a few ways to do this again but let's do the following let's say padding 10 pixels okay and that's going to pad the uh what is it the content box here then i'm going to say my background color is and let's just go with red alright so that's fine but i would like it to be transparent so we're going to say let's do it in hex this time ff000 and now we have kind of this transparent box around and then i'm going to say my border radius is 5 pixel all right so that kind of now matches up with what programming expert one had my boxes are slightly different size because it's sizing based on the icon size but that's fine i won't get that picky right now okay so already looking much better the next thing i need to do now is lay all these out in a row so i see i have my stats container so i'm just going to now apply flex styling to my stats container so i'm going to say stats container i'm going to say display and then flex okay and now automatically they're going to go into row now we need some gap so let's say gap be 1em and there we go and then i will align items in the center and i will justify content flex start so now let's make this a bit bigger and this is looking good okay so good looking card so far of course obviously we got to add these down below but if we go look at this uh you know we're not too far off somewhat from uh from what the layout's looking like let's look at that we might want more a slightly more of a margin there but for now that's fine okay so let's add more of a margin on our uh interior padding so let's go 10 15 10 15. now we just squish it in a little bit more that looks a bit nicer all right continuing we now need to handle the bottom uh of of what we need here so the bottom section is our gray container so let's start with that and then we can do what's inside of the container all right so let's say dot gray container okay background color will be light gray all right and then we want to add a border radius so border radius of 5 pixels add some rounded edges here okay so now we have our rounded edges now that we need to align the items within the gray container so i'm going to say display flex okay and now we've aligned on row that's good but we want to push the button to the right hand side and keep the icon and the text on the left hand side right so if you look here we have kind of if we make this larger this kind of stays on the left hand side and then the button gets pushed to the right so we'll do that with flexbox let's not minimize that let's put that over here the way we will do that is we'll change this slightly so we have three items here now what i want to do is i want to use the property space between when i use space between it's going to push my items out with the space between now the issue is since i have three items if i do space between right now and actually i mean we might as well just add it because we're going to add it anyways let's say justify content space not around space between you'll see that we get them kind of all aligned right i don't want lessons in the middle i want this pushed to the left so the way i have to fix that is i have to make it so i only have two items here so to do that i will now take my i and my lessons wrap those in a div and then by wrapping those in a div the two direct flex items will be the div and the button so the contents of the div will push to the left and then the button will be pushed to the right hopefully that makes a bit of sense i don't even need to give this a class right now i just need to wrap it in a div and when i do that we get pushed to left right so let's say div div now i will add a class because as you can see since i have my h3 tag which is display block i'm going down what i want to do instead is i want to push them so they're on the same line so to do that we'll add our class and we'll say class is equal to i'll just call this left for right now okay now let's go here and add our left so we're going to say dot left okay and then this is going to be display flex like that and now they are kind of pushed together however again we're having this issue where this icon here right is uh not in line with lessons so to fix that we just say uh align items and then this is going to be center and now we've aligned them now of course the problem is we want some padding here and some margins so let's add that we're going to say gap 5 pixels now we're separating slightly from the icon which is what we wanted okay so that's going well continuing we want to style the button we want to add some space now between our two gray containers and how are we going to do that well there's multiple ways to add space between the gray containers the first way is just to add a margin bottom property or alternatively a margin top property so i'll show you the first way if i do something like margin dash top of let's say five percent now you see that we just have a five percent gap based on the height of this card um between the items now the reason why you may not want to do that is because that adds five percent margin to both of these not just the assessment one right because you have the same class for both so now you're getting five percent margin from the description tag now i actually don't think that's too bad but then you see when you do something like this okay well now five percent looks really really big right so maybe we don't want to use five percent maybe we want to use something else so rather than five percent maybe we just do one em and now we'll have the same amount of margin no matter how big the size is and that looks fine to me uh okay yeah that's that's good for for right now uh okay looks good all right so actually let's just leave the margin top of 1em and i'll show you if you change this to bottom now you just get some margin at the bottom right so you're getting a margin of this plus the margin of the original content so just to continue this there's a lot of stuff to go through here if i now change my margin bottom which is this to be zero pixels um okay no actually i don't want to do that um okay i don't know where i was going with that anyways you get the point the point is we have you know the padding here right for the card padding the content but then we also have added a margin here so you're getting a little bit of a weird kind of layout thing going because we have margin bottom on on both of these uh these classes anyways that's fine for now okay so this is looking good now we want to style the button and we want to just push everything in a bit so let's go to our great container and let's add some padding with the content so let's just say padding dash left 10 pixels okay and then we'll just do the same thing on padding right and rather than pixels uh just to keep it a bit more dynamic let's go 1em and uh and one em here as well now i'm just doing that because i don't really care about the padding vertically at least right now but once i resize the button i will probably add the same padding actually everywhere so let's just say padding 1em uh like like that okay yeah so that looks a bit better so let's now adjust our button so let's go here to button and it'll be dot button although i guess we could just directly access the button and let's change the color so let's say the background color of the button will be i guess navy and then we'll say the color of the text will be white and then we want to adjust the font size so i'm going to say font size be 20 uh px okay so that's nice now we want a border radius on the button so it's a bit rounded so let's say 5 pixels okay that looks fine to me and then we want to remove the border so we're going to say border dash color and i'm just going to make that transparent and now that gets rid of our border all right so i know it's not quite the same color as this and we also probably want to make it a bit longer so let's do that by saying padding dash left 1em and padding dash right ym as well all right so now let's have a look at this and it's starting to look somewhat like this car now i know this cart takes up less less width on the screen but you get the idea we kind of have a general layout as opposed to the colors and and all of that okay so that looks good uh last thing i'll do is just add a hover effect here to the button and then i think we'll be pretty well good so let's go button let's go hover and let's change the background color just be blue so now when i hover there you go all right so let's now just add one more of these to the screen so let's copy the card we'll add some margin between the cards uh and actually oh they already have did i already add the margin on the card let's see where's my card oh yeah margin five percent so since i have margin of five percent they already have the margins that's what i need so you can see here i have my program fundamentals and then of course you know i get the same thing again and there you are so we have essentially created this i know it doesn't look exactly the same but you guys get the idea it's close enough for me and that hopefully showed you how you design kind of a responsive flexible layout and as i continue to change the size here these cards still make sense there is a minimum size i can't go any smaller based on the way that i've done this and everything should kind of automatically be scaling because of the way that i've used flexbox so with that said i think i will end the video here if you guys want to challenge yourself try to create some components on programming expert maybe buy it while you're at it you can use discount code tim with that said hope you enjoyed the video if you did make sure you hit like subscribe to the channel let me know if you want to see some more css content and i will see you in another youtube video you
