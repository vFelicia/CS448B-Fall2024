00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in today's
00:02 - video what we're gonna be doing is
00:03 - setting up a Google Calendar API or I
00:07 - guess just working with the Google
00:09 - Calendar API for our voices system so I
00:11 - saw a lot of comments on the previous
00:12 - videos saying that you guys want some
00:14 - kind of calendar support so whether that
00:16 - be you know asking the bot for your next
00:18 - event in the day or adding an event or
00:20 - changing something and whatever it is
00:22 - we're gonna add a few of those different
00:23 - functions in here
00:24 - the first thing that we need to do in
00:26 - what this video is kind of gonna be
00:27 - dedicated to is just getting set up with
00:29 - this API now fortunately for us Google
00:31 - actually writes a ton of really helpful
00:33 - kind of QuickStart tutorials on how to
00:35 - use this so we're just gonna follow
00:36 - along with this today I mean it's pretty
00:39 - straightforward and you could probably
00:40 - figure it out without actually watching
00:42 - the video if you just want to read
00:43 - through this but for anyone running into
00:44 - any issues I'm gonna walk you through it
00:46 - step by step here so the first thing we
00:48 - need to do is go to this link here that
00:50 - I'm gonna have in the description down
00:52 - below and you're gonna make sure that
00:54 - you sign in to the correct Google
00:55 - account now I know for me I have a bunch
00:57 - of different Google accounts for this
00:59 - tutorial I'm just using one that's like
01:00 - a random one that I just created because
01:03 - you guys are gonna actually see my
01:04 - credentials while I do this now what I'm
01:07 - gonna do here and start by turning on
01:09 - the Google Calendar API and we're gonna
01:12 - do is click enable the Google Calendar
01:14 - API and for you guys if this your first
01:16 - time working with like Google developer
01:19 - console or whatever this is called it
01:21 - may ask you to create an application all
01:23 - you need to do is just give it some kind
01:24 - of name I just named mine like test or
01:26 - tutorial or Python or whatever you want
01:28 - and then go ahead and click Next and it
01:30 - should bring you a page that looks like
01:32 - this
01:32 - from here we're gonna download our
01:34 - client configuration which is gonna come
01:37 - in the form of a JSON file in the bottom
01:38 - left hand corner of our screen this just
01:40 - stores the information that we need to
01:42 - sign in on and authenticate with Google
01:45 - which we need to do every time we
01:46 - actually want to activate this API and
01:48 - start using it from Python now what
01:51 - we're gonna do here with this
01:52 - credentials JSON is we're gonna put it
01:54 - in the working directory of our Python
01:57 - script so hopefully you guys know where
01:58 - that is I have to find mine which I
02:01 - believe is here I was already testing
02:03 - this out so I'm gonna delete that one
02:04 - and just drag in I guess I have to put
02:07 - these like split-screen and just drag in
02:09 - my credentials here so make sure that's
02:11 - in the same
02:12 - directory as your main DUP Python
02:13 - whatever file you were using for the
02:15 - last video okay so now that we've done
02:18 - that we can move on to step two which is
02:20 - installing the pip modules which is
02:23 - Google auth Lib and the Python API so
02:27 - what this is gonna do is just you know
02:29 - allow you to authenticate and all of
02:30 - that and we're gonna get through this
02:32 - code in a second that tells you how to
02:33 - do that so I'm just gonna copy this I
02:35 - can open up the command prompt window
02:36 - and I'm gonna type this by just hitting
02:38 - Enter now obviously I already have this
02:41 - all installed as you guys can see here
02:43 - that's all you need to do again make
02:45 - sure you're in the right virtual
02:46 - environment and that pip is working
02:47 - correctly and then you know if you
02:49 - already have this installed because of
02:50 - this upgrade here it's gonna upgrade to
02:52 - the newest version which is obviously
02:53 - what we want okay awesome so now that we
02:56 - have that we're actually kind of almost
02:57 - done setting this up but we just need to
02:59 - actually copy all of this code from the
03:02 - web page here and run it somewhat within
03:05 - our scripts we're gonna do a little bit
03:06 - of refactoring here we're gonna copy
03:08 - this we're gonna open up our Python
03:10 - script from the previous videos which
03:12 - looks something like this yours might
03:15 - look a little bit different and then
03:16 - we're just gonna kind of paste this code
03:17 - in and refactor it a little bit so I'm
03:19 - just gonna put it at the bottom of my
03:21 - screen here and what I'm gonna do is
03:23 - just kind of start moving some of these
03:25 - import statements up against the top of
03:27 - our program so I'm gonna copy all of
03:29 - these and make sure you actually paste
03:32 - them above all of these import
03:34 - statements because whenever you import
03:36 - the future module you actually need to
03:38 - have that at the beginning of your
03:40 - program here so make sure you have that
03:42 - all the way up at the top so all of
03:44 - these go before you know OS time and all
03:46 - the other imports you did in the
03:47 - previous video next I'm gonna take
03:50 - scopes here and that comment I guess and
03:52 - just throw it up at the top of my
03:54 - program here because I like to have it's
03:56 - like all my global variables defined at
03:59 - the top then what I'm gonna do is kind
04:01 - of just clean up some of these comments
04:03 - here that I don't actually really need
04:04 - and just get rid of them here okay so
04:08 - now I'm gonna kind of talk about what
04:10 - this code does and we're actually gonna
04:12 - run the program but I'm else we're just
04:13 - gonna get rid of this little bit here
04:15 - that says text equals get audio if hello
04:18 - and text because for right now we don't
04:20 - actually want that so clean up some of
04:22 - these indentation and then we should be
04:24 - good to actually test this out okay so
04:27 - what this script is actually gonna do
04:29 - that we just downloaded is it's gonna
04:31 - create kind of like a local cache of
04:33 - your credentials so that every time you
04:35 - sign into Google you don't need to do
04:37 - what we're about to do so what this does
04:40 - is uses the pickle module to actually
04:43 - open up your credentials which is from
04:46 - that JSON file and then log you in to
04:48 - Google what you guys gonna see in a
04:50 - second save kind of that token
04:52 - information and all of that so that
04:53 - every time we run this we don't need to
04:56 - re kind of I guess what is it like
04:58 - validate ourselves re sign in which
05:00 - actually ends up taking a little bit of
05:01 - time so let's actually just run this now
05:03 - by the way to run something sub line
05:05 - text I've been hitting control B give
05:08 - this a second and you can see it's
05:09 - actually gonna pop up this here to sign
05:11 - into your Google accounts now I've
05:13 - blurred my other ones out but I'm gonna
05:15 - do use this test send email account that
05:17 - I made a while ago that doesn't have
05:19 - anything important on it and it's gonna
05:20 - say this app isn't verified what we
05:23 - actually need to do is click on advanced
05:25 - and click go to QuickStart I know it
05:27 - says it's unsafe but it's not just
05:30 - because you're opening it from Python
05:31 - and it doesn't think that it's a valid
05:33 - program so now what I'm gonna do is
05:35 - click on allow this to view my calendars
05:38 - but I can also allow them and actually
05:40 - wait I think that's it yeah so we'll do
05:41 - that and we will hit allow so now we are
05:45 - actually giving that app that we just
05:47 - use a Python script access to view our
05:50 - calendars so we'll go ahead and click
05:52 - allow there and now you can see it says
05:54 - the authentication flow has completed
05:56 - you may close this window awesome so
05:59 - there we go and now we are actually
06:01 - authenticated and ready to go okay so I
06:04 - had a quick bug there because I don't
06:05 - think I've waited long enough but
06:06 - essentially what should happen is after
06:08 - you authenticate yourself the first time
06:11 - so you run the program what it does is
06:13 - it generates a pickle file which
06:15 - actually looks like this of token pickle
06:17 - which stores that credential information
06:19 - so now every time after when we run the
06:22 - program what ends up happening is we
06:24 - actually don't need to go through that
06:26 - kind of web browser thing where we sign
06:28 - into the account and click allow it
06:29 - should just automatically authenticate
06:31 - us and then actually print out the
06:34 - ten upcoming events that we have now
06:36 - that's what this bottom part is doing
06:38 - here when we get the time and we have
06:40 - this if statements down here this part
06:42 - up here is doing all of your kind of
06:44 - credentials and logging in all right so
06:46 - we're gonna do now is just refactor this
06:48 - code a little bit so it works better for
06:50 - our actual use and then we're gonna get
06:52 - into some specific applications of
06:54 - Google Calendar like actually using this
06:56 - bot to ask you know what is the next
06:58 - event or do I have an event on Thursday
07:00 - in the next video but what I need to do
07:02 - here is kind of split up this function
07:04 - into two and what I want to do is have
07:06 - one function that authenticates the user
07:10 - and that happens before the bot even
07:12 - really starts running kind of in the
07:13 - main script so that that way we don't
07:15 - have to wait for this token file to be
07:17 - generated before we actually want to run
07:19 - this voice assistant and start speaking
07:21 - to it the next function I'm gonna have
07:23 - is what's gonna actually get the events
07:25 - for us and so what we're pretty much
07:28 - gonna do is just split this into two I'm
07:30 - gonna show you how to do that pretty
07:31 - easily so I'm gonna start by renaming
07:34 - this main function to authenticate
07:37 - underscore and Google now I could do
07:40 - calendar as well but I think that's
07:42 - pretty straightforward right now and
07:44 - what I'm gonna do is actually add a
07:45 - return statement comma in the middle
07:47 - here that says return service so what
07:50 - we're gonna do is have this function run
07:53 - at the beginning of our program and
07:55 - return to us a service that contains the
07:58 - Google calendar for our user so or I
08:01 - guess for us in this case then what
08:03 - we're going to do is create another
08:03 - function here so after this return
08:06 - statement that's gonna be called gets
08:07 - underscore events and what we're gonna
08:10 - do in here is put two parameters so the
08:14 - first one is gonna be n and the second
08:15 - one is gonna be service now what n is
08:17 - gonna do is be the amount of events we
08:20 - want to get and service is going to be
08:22 - well the service that was returned to us
08:24 - from authenticate Google so that way we
08:27 - can just pass through this service and
08:28 - pass through the number of events we
08:30 - want to get and we are able to do that
08:32 - so what I'm gonna do is start by in the
08:35 - main line of my program just calling
08:38 - authenticate Google and that's actually
08:41 - going to be equal to service so service
08:44 - equals authenticate Google and since
08:46 - we're returning the service
08:47 - that contains the calendar with all the
08:49 - events we can store that in a variable
08:50 - here and whenever we call yet events we
08:53 - can simply pass it through so anyways
08:55 - we're not done with get events yet what
08:56 - we're gonna do is just change wherever
08:58 - it says 10:00 essentially to say n so
09:00 - that this will be kind of more dynamic
09:02 - and be able to get any amount of events
09:04 - that we want so I'm gonna make this
09:06 - print statement and F string and put in
09:08 - here n so it stands for it getting the
09:11 - upcoming end events which will be how
09:13 - many we pass through and then what I'm
09:14 - gonna do is change max results here to
09:17 - be n so now what's gonna happen is we're
09:19 - only gonna get however many events we
09:21 - pass through to the parameter so now I'm
09:23 - simply gonna say get underscore events
09:26 - here I'm gonna pass in n as like just
09:29 - say two in this case and then service
09:31 - will pass in there as well and now what
09:33 - I'm gonna do is just run this program
09:35 - and see if everything is working now
09:38 - apparently when I run this on sub line
09:40 - text it takes like a really long time so
09:42 - I'll fast forward until it actually
09:44 - shows it but you can run it through
09:45 - command prompt and usually it runs way
09:47 - faster okay so there we are you can see
09:49 - that we have now these two events that
09:51 - came up so these are the first two that
09:52 - show up in my calendar so test event and
09:54 - then Thursday event and that is pretty
09:57 - much how this works now obviously we're
09:59 - gonna make this more advanced in the
10:00 - next video and actually use the voice
10:02 - assistant to trigger this and give us
10:04 - the information and read it out to us
10:05 - but for now that should hopefully give
10:07 - you enough to look maybe play with a
10:09 - little bit and figure out how to do
10:10 - things we already know how to check if
10:13 - the user has said specific things you
10:15 - can probably match that up and read out
10:17 - some of these events and all of that so
10:18 - with that being said if you guys enjoyed
10:20 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
10:21 - to the channel and as always if you have
10:24 - any ideas for the rest of the series
10:25 - please leave them in the comments down
10:26 - below as I was always looking for those

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back so in today's video what we're gonna be doing is setting up a Google Calendar API or I guess just working with the Google Calendar API for our voices system so I saw a lot of comments on the previous videos saying that you guys want some kind of calendar support so whether that be you know asking the bot for your next event in the day or adding an event or changing something and whatever it is we're gonna add a few of those different functions in here the first thing that we need to do in what this video is kind of gonna be dedicated to is just getting set up with this API now fortunately for us Google actually writes a ton of really helpful kind of QuickStart tutorials on how to use this so we're just gonna follow along with this today I mean it's pretty straightforward and you could probably figure it out without actually watching the video if you just want to read through this but for anyone running into any issues I'm gonna walk you through it step by step here so the first thing we need to do is go to this link here that I'm gonna have in the description down below and you're gonna make sure that you sign in to the correct Google account now I know for me I have a bunch of different Google accounts for this tutorial I'm just using one that's like a random one that I just created because you guys are gonna actually see my credentials while I do this now what I'm gonna do here and start by turning on the Google Calendar API and we're gonna do is click enable the Google Calendar API and for you guys if this your first time working with like Google developer console or whatever this is called it may ask you to create an application all you need to do is just give it some kind of name I just named mine like test or tutorial or Python or whatever you want and then go ahead and click Next and it should bring you a page that looks like this from here we're gonna download our client configuration which is gonna come in the form of a JSON file in the bottom left hand corner of our screen this just stores the information that we need to sign in on and authenticate with Google which we need to do every time we actually want to activate this API and start using it from Python now what we're gonna do here with this credentials JSON is we're gonna put it in the working directory of our Python script so hopefully you guys know where that is I have to find mine which I believe is here I was already testing this out so I'm gonna delete that one and just drag in I guess I have to put these like splitscreen and just drag in my credentials here so make sure that's in the same directory as your main DUP Python whatever file you were using for the last video okay so now that we've done that we can move on to step two which is installing the pip modules which is Google auth Lib and the Python API so what this is gonna do is just you know allow you to authenticate and all of that and we're gonna get through this code in a second that tells you how to do that so I'm just gonna copy this I can open up the command prompt window and I'm gonna type this by just hitting Enter now obviously I already have this all installed as you guys can see here that's all you need to do again make sure you're in the right virtual environment and that pip is working correctly and then you know if you already have this installed because of this upgrade here it's gonna upgrade to the newest version which is obviously what we want okay awesome so now that we have that we're actually kind of almost done setting this up but we just need to actually copy all of this code from the web page here and run it somewhat within our scripts we're gonna do a little bit of refactoring here we're gonna copy this we're gonna open up our Python script from the previous videos which looks something like this yours might look a little bit different and then we're just gonna kind of paste this code in and refactor it a little bit so I'm just gonna put it at the bottom of my screen here and what I'm gonna do is just kind of start moving some of these import statements up against the top of our program so I'm gonna copy all of these

sure you have that all the way up at the top so all of these go before you know OS time and all the other imports you did in the previous video next I'm gonna take scopes here and that comment I guess and just throw it up at the top of my program here because I like to have it's like all my global variables defined at the top then what I'm gonna do is kind of just clean up some of these comments here that I don't actually really need and just get rid of them here okay so now I'm gonna kind of talk about what this code does and we're actually gonna run the program but I'm else we're just gonna get rid of this little bit here that says text equals get audio if hello and text because for right now we don't actually want that so clean up some of these indentation and then we should be good to actually test this out okay so what this script is actually gonna do that we just downloaded is it's gonna create kind of like a local cache of your credentials so that every time you sign into Google

yeah so we'll do that and we will hit allow so now we are actually giving that app that we just use a Python script access to view our calendars so we'll go ahead and click allow there and now you can see it says the authentication flow has completed you may close this window awesome so there we go and now we are actually authenticated and ready to go okay so I had a quick bug there because I don't
