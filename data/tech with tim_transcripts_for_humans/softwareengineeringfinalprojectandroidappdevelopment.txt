00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video I will be doing a demo of my
00:03 - first ever Android application now this
00:06 - Android app was built for school so as
00:08 - most of you know I'm a computer science
00:10 - student I'm actually enrolled in a
00:11 - software engineering class this semester
00:13 - and our final project for this class was
00:16 - to create this exact application so
00:18 - every group had to create the same app a
00:20 - walk-in clinic organizer you guys will
00:22 - see how this works there's three main
00:24 - users that we had to accommodate here so
00:25 - an admin user an employee user and a
00:28 - patient user and I'll talk about the
00:29 - responsibilities of each of those users
00:31 - as we kind of go in and talk more about
00:33 - the application I will say actually did
00:35 - build this with four other students so
00:38 - most of the other students did a lot of
00:39 - the UI stuff and kind of the
00:40 - lighter-weight back and work whereas my
00:42 - main responsibility was doing the more
00:44 - kind of intense back-end stuff that was
00:46 - a bit more difficult as well as all of
00:48 - the database components and I would say
00:50 - that I probably wrote a lot of the code
00:52 - that you guys gonna see in the github
00:54 - repository that I've linked down below
00:55 - for this project also if you guys would
00:57 - like to run this app there is an APK
00:59 - down there so if you have an android
01:00 - phone or you just want to try it on
01:01 - android studio you're more than welcome
01:03 - to do that and in case I didn't mention
01:05 - that this is written in Java
01:07 - alright so let's actually just get in
01:08 - and start looking at the application so
01:10 - I'm gonna start from the administrator
01:11 - user and then go to the employee user
01:13 - and the patient user which is our three
01:15 - users for this application and talk
01:17 - about what each can do so this is our
01:19 - admin log and I'm gonna blur it out
01:21 - because you guys can actually log in if
01:23 - you see that and our admin has two main
01:25 - things that it can do it can create
01:27 - modify and delete services that can be
01:29 - offered by the different walking clinics
01:31 - and it can view and delete the different
01:34 - users of this actual walking clinic app
01:36 - so here you can see this is a list of
01:39 - all the users coincidentally they're all
01:40 - named Tim because those obviously is me
01:42 - that's doing the user there and here is
01:45 - a list of all the services and they can
01:47 - be offered by the walking clinic now if
01:48 - I hard press on one of these services I
01:50 - can actually modify them so I could
01:51 - change this to be something like I don't
01:53 - know checkup or whatever like that we'll
01:57 - do an exclamation point that can be
01:59 - performed by a doctor I can update that
02:01 - and now you see we have that there and
02:03 - then obviously I can add services by
02:05 - putting them up here choosing who
02:07 - performs them and clicking at now this
02:09 - is useful use this allows the admin to
02:11 - kind of moderate which services
02:13 - are allowed to be offered by the
02:14 - different walking clinics okay so that
02:16 - is our admin user now the next user that
02:19 - I'm going to talk about is our employee
02:20 - user so actually login as one that I've
02:22 - already created just to save us a bit of
02:24 - time here and you can see that this is
02:27 - our employee on user kind of interface
02:29 - so we have a profile hours services and
02:33 - working hours so essentially kind of the
02:35 - theory behind this is each employee is
02:37 - responsible for one walking clinic and
02:40 - they're responsible for setting up that
02:41 - clinic profile so information say about
02:44 - like you know the road or the street
02:46 - address that this clinic is on as well
02:48 - as the phone number for the clinic and
02:49 - the name you know I can change this
02:51 - clinic name to just be cool clinic or
02:53 - something like that so we can see which
02:55 - one this is
02:55 - I can change the accepted payment
02:57 - methods and notice obviously we'll have
03:00 - some checks here so like let's say I
03:01 - don't enter a valid phone number then
03:03 - and I click Save please choose that one
03:06 - okay let's choose one of those now it
03:08 - should give us the pop-up message
03:09 - invalid phone number so there's checks
03:11 - to make sure all this works and if I
03:12 - click on this little trigger icon
03:14 - whatever this we want to call that will
03:16 - actually open up Google Maps and show us
03:18 - the address of what we're talking about
03:19 - all right so let's go back here let's
03:21 - actually hit save for this clinic
03:23 - profile that's gonna save that in the
03:24 - database now which I'm going to show you
03:26 - guys later
03:26 - next we can actually configure the
03:28 - clinic working hours so this is the
03:30 - hours that the clinic will be open for
03:32 - so this is important obviously to be
03:33 - able to set now this was an interesting
03:36 - decision on how we were gonna do this
03:38 - because technically you know what clinic
03:40 - could be open some days you get closed
03:41 - for a holiday you could be open one week
03:44 - and then maybe on Friday next week you
03:46 - don't want to be open so what we decided
03:47 - to do was allow the user to set the
03:49 - working hours for the clinic using these
03:51 - little time Pickers and then decide if a
03:53 - day was open or closed by simply
03:54 - clicking open or closed on this little
03:56 - toggle on the side now that can
03:58 - obviously change every week you could go
04:01 - in whenever you want and close a day
04:02 - without actually modifying these hours
04:04 - but you know that's up to you so save
04:06 - we'll save that change for us obviously
04:08 - and then here this little bit
04:09 - information about how this works in case
04:11 - anyone's confused when using this page
04:13 - awesome so we updated those the next
04:16 - thing to talk about is the clinic
04:17 - services now clinic services needs to be
04:19 - added by the employee so essentially the
04:22 - employee says well what services do our
04:23 - walk-in clinic adds they can have a look
04:25 - at all the services that
04:26 - and be offered and they can long press
04:28 - on one of them if they'd like them to be
04:30 - offered by their clinic and we can see
04:31 - that these are the ones that are
04:32 - currently offered next we have working
04:35 - hours which is simply kind of similar to
04:37 - clinic hours but this is actually
04:39 - working hours of the specific employee
04:41 - that's using this application so they're
04:44 - setting kind of their own shift or their
04:46 - own schedule don't ask me why we need
04:48 - this it's just was part of the rubric
04:50 - that we need to follow when creating
04:51 - this app okay so lastly I'm actually
04:54 - gonna sign in as a patient employee now
04:57 - or a patient employee as a patient user
04:59 - oh that's not a login so let's actually
05:01 - just create a new account and I'll show
05:03 - you that feature as well so let's make
05:04 - our name you know patient like that we
05:08 - make our username Tim I should just make
05:10 - it P Tim like patient Tim and then
05:12 - Bertie is the famous password okay so
05:16 - that's a patient account we'll click
05:17 - that we've created this account now it
05:19 - says welcome P Tim you are logged in as
05:20 - a patient and as a patient we can do two
05:22 - things which is book appointments or we
05:24 - can view and rate past appointments so
05:27 - if I show you and I view appointments
05:29 - here currently we have nothing but if I
05:32 - go to book slash check-in I can view the
05:35 - list of different clinics I can actually
05:36 - search for clinics based on name if I
05:38 - wanted to so in this case let's go Tim
05:40 - you can see that now that actually is
05:42 - gonna filter out and give me this clinic
05:43 - and it shows the rating for this clinic
05:45 - I can also search by address as well as
05:47 - the days of operation so what days the
05:49 - clinic they are open for it but by
05:51 - default it starts by just showing me all
05:52 - clinics that are available okay so let's
05:54 - look at Tim's clinic here we can see
05:56 - that it's rated 3 stars I can click this
05:58 - little icon again if I want to see the
06:00 - address in Google Maps and then I have a
06:02 - current waiting time so if I were to go
06:04 - to that walking clinic now how long
06:06 - would I have to wait to be seen and that
06:07 - I'll talk about later
06:08 - sometimes this messes up a little bit
06:11 - but you can see the list of clinics that
06:13 - are here first time when you click on it
06:14 - sometimes it doesn't show up just a
06:16 - database like there and this is actually
06:18 - what I can use to book an appointment so
06:20 - I'm in my clinic I can view the
06:21 - information about it and if I'd like to
06:22 - book an appointment well I can choose a
06:24 - date so let's maybe choose you know
06:26 - Tuesday the 10th is when I want to book
06:28 - an appointment I'll choose a time if I
06:30 - try to hit save in a time that is not
06:32 - available it's gonna tell me clinic is
06:34 - closed at that time so let's make this
06:35 - available let's go
06:37 - you know 1026 a.m. will
06:39 - same and notice when I do that it
06:41 - actually automatically rounds my time to
06:43 - the nearest 15 minute interval because
06:45 - that is when we allow appointments to be
06:46 - booked
06:47 - next I can click booked appointment give
06:49 - that a second that's gonna book the
06:50 - appointment for me and now if I go into
06:52 - view appointments I can actually view my
06:54 - upcoming appointments and click on that
06:55 - for some information or decide to cancel
06:57 - the appointment if I like now I'm just
06:59 - gonna make an appointment in the past
07:01 - quickly and show you guys how it works
07:02 - to rating past appointments okay so now
07:05 - I'm going to show you a more advanced
07:06 - feature of kind of the clinic booking
07:09 - check-in process
07:10 - so essentially what I've actually done
07:11 - if I view my appointments I've booked
07:13 - another appointment here so I've booked
07:14 - one that's actually at 8:30 which is in
07:16 - two minutes from what it is right now
07:18 - and I just want to show you what happens
07:19 - when I go to try to book another
07:20 - appointment so if I go to cool clinic
07:22 - you can see that it gives us a current
07:24 - estimated waiting time of 16 minutes now
07:27 - the reason we get this is because
07:29 - currently it's 829 and the next
07:31 - appointment will be finished at 8:45
07:33 - because we booked one at 8:30 each
07:35 - appointment actually lasts 15 minutes so
07:37 - this is telling us essentially when is
07:39 - the next time from the current time that
07:41 - we could book another appointment that
07:42 - we could be seen so I think that that is
07:44 - pretty cool this is a feature that we
07:46 - needed to add it was mandatory for kind
07:48 - of a deliverable but to get it work
07:50 - properly with like time in the past and
07:52 - appointment stacking up is actually not
07:53 - as easy as it looks now I'm gonna go
07:55 - back to view appointments here and I'm
07:57 - gonna show you what happens as soon as
07:59 - this hits 8:30 where my appointments are
08:01 - actually gonna change so my appointment
08:03 - from the here that is you know at 8:30
08:05 - is actually gonna go into the past
08:07 - appointments page as soon as we hit 8:30
08:09 - all right so it's 8:30 now which means
08:11 - this appointment is officially in the
08:13 - past because you know it's actually just
08:15 - happened technically we could have made
08:16 - it at you know 8:45 once the
08:18 - appointments finished it goes in the
08:19 - past but I think this is more than fine
08:21 - and you can see that now when I have
08:23 - this past appointment there's a button
08:25 - that allows me to rape my service so how
08:27 - I felt that the service was so here you
08:29 - know this pumps up a little dialog I can
08:31 - choose the amount of stars I want to
08:32 - give this so maybe we'll give it five
08:33 - stars then it says you rated this five
08:36 - stars and if you click on it again you
08:38 - can see the rating that you gave it now
08:40 - I can also decide to remove this
08:42 - appointment from my list of past
08:44 - appointments so say I have a ton of
08:45 - different appointments here I can decide
08:47 - to remove that if I want to see you know
08:49 - my most recent ones or anything like
08:50 - that and then the
08:51 - upcoming appointment set on one anymore
08:53 - I can just cancel it by doing that
08:55 - alright so that has been 8 for my first
08:57 - ever Android application now don't get
08:59 - me wrong there's a ton of stuff that
09:01 - needs to be improved I'm gonna say right
09:03 - now for any of you guys that look at the
09:04 - github repository you were gonna be very
09:07 - disappointed when you read through the
09:08 - source code but I will say this project
09:10 - was on a deadline and kind of my last
09:12 - concern was writing good source code
09:14 - when you know I have a million things to
09:16 - do and all I need to do is finish this
09:17 - project so it's an absolute mess of a
09:19 - project you guys can read through it
09:21 - look at the source code if you want but
09:23 - please you know go easy on me because
09:25 - remember this is my first time building
09:26 - an Android app I had no plan and this is
09:28 - really just patch fixes whenever
09:30 - something went wrong anyways yeah that
09:32 - has been in I mean if you guys have made
09:34 - it this far let me know in the comments
09:36 - down below what you think of this app
09:37 - could I add anything to it is there
09:39 - anything that's really bad did you like
09:40 - something about it and are you
09:41 - interested in possibly building an
09:43 - Android app in the future
09:44 - personally I had a lot of fun doing this
09:46 - I learned a ton and I feel like I could
09:48 - go out there and build you know a proper
09:49 - Android oh now with the amount of
09:51 - knowledge that I've had so as always if
09:53 - you guys enjoyed leave a like on the
09:55 - video subscribe to the channel down
09:56 - below and if you want to run this app
09:57 - the github repository is in the
09:59 - description

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video I will be doing a demo of my first ever Android application now this Android app was built for school so as most of you know I'm a computer science student I'm actually enrolled in a software engineering class this semester and our final project for this class was to create this exact application so every group had to create the same app a walkin clinic organizer you guys will see how this works there's three main users that we had to accommodate here so an admin user an employee user and a patient user and I'll talk about the responsibilities of each of those users as we kind of go in and talk more about the application I will say actually did build this with four other students so most of the other students did a lot of the UI stuff and kind of the lighterweight back and work whereas my main responsibility was doing the more kind of intense backend stuff that was a bit more difficult as well as all of the database components and I would say that I probably wrote a lot of the code that you guys gonna see in the github repository that I've linked down below for this project also if you guys would like to run this app there is an APK down there so if you have an android phone or you just want to try it on android studio you're more than welcome to do that and in case I didn't mention that this is written in Java alright so let's actually just get in and start looking at the application so I'm gonna start from the administrator user and then go to the employee user and the patient user which is our three users for this application and talk about what each can do so this is our admin log and I'm gonna blur it out because you guys can actually log in if you see that and our admin has two main things that it can do it can create modify and delete services that can be offered by the different walking clinics and it can view and delete the different users of this actual walking clinic app so here you can see this is a list of all the users coincidentally they're all named Tim because those obviously is me that's doing the user there and here is a list of all the services and they can be offered by the walking clinic now if I hard press on one of these services I can actually modify them so I could change this to be something like I don't know checkup or whatever like that we'll do an exclamation point that can be performed by a doctor I can update that and now you see we have that there and then obviously I can add services by putting them up here choosing who performs them and clicking at now this is useful use this allows the admin to kind of moderate which services are allowed to be offered by the different walking clinics okay so that is our admin user now the next user that I'm going to talk about is our employee user so actually login as one that I've already created just to save us a bit of time here and you can see that this is our employee on user kind of interface so we have a profile hours services and working hours so essentially kind of the theory behind this is each employee is responsible for one walking clinic and they're responsible for setting up that clinic profile so information say about like you know the road or the street address that this clinic is on as well as the phone number for the clinic and the name you know I can change this clinic name to just be cool clinic or something like that so we can see which one this is I can change the accepted payment methods and notice obviously we'll have some checks here so like let's say I don't enter a valid phone number then and I click Save please choose that one okay let's choose one of those now it should give us the popup message invalid phone number so there's checks to make sure all this works and if I click on this little trigger icon whatever this we want to call that will actually open up Google Maps and show us the address of what we're talking about all right so let's go back here let's actually hit save for this clinic profile that's gonna save that in the database now which I'm going to show you guys later next we can actually configure the clinic working hours so this is the hours that the clinic will be open for so this is important obviously to be able to set now this was an interesting decision on how we were gonna do this because technically you know what clinic could be open some days you get closed for a holiday you could be open one week and then maybe on Friday next week you don't want to be open so what we decided to do was allow the user to set the working hours for the clinic using these little time Pickers and then decide if a day was open or closed by simply clicking open or closed on this little toggle on the side now that can obviously change every week you could go in whenever you want and close a day without actually modifying these hours but you know that's up to you so save we'll save that change for us obviously and then here this little bit information about how this works in case anyone's confused when using this page awesome so we updated those the next thing to talk about is the clinic services now clinic services needs to be added by the employee so essentially the employee says well what services do our walkin clinic adds they can have a look at all the services that and be offered and they can long press on one of them if they'd

actually working hours of the specific employee that's using this application so they're setting kind of their own shift or their own schedule don't ask me why we need this it's just was part of the

try to hit save in a time that is not available it's gonna tell me clinic is closed at that time so let's make this available let's go you know 1026 a.m. will same and notice when I do that it actually automatically rounds my time to the nearest 15 minute interval because that is when we allow appointments to be booked next I can click booked appointment give that a second that's gonna book

checkin process so essentially what I've actually done if I view my appointments I've booked another appointment here so I've booked one that's actually at 830 which is in two minutes from what it is right now and I just want to show you what happens when I go to try to book another appointment so if I go to cool clinic you can see that it gives us a current estimated waiting time of 16 minutes now the reason we get this is because currently it's 829 and the next appointment will be finished at 845 because we booked one at 830 each appointment actually lasts 15 minutes so this is telling us essentially when is the next time from the current time that we could book another appointment that we could be seen so I think that that is pretty cool this is a feature that we needed to add it was mandatory for kind of a deliverable but to get it work properly with like time in the past and appointment stacking up is actually not as easy as it looks now I'm gonna go back to view appointments here and I'm gonna show you what happens as soon as this hits 830 where my appointments are actually gonna change so my appointment from the here that is you know at 830 is actually gonna go into the past appointments page as soon as we hit 830 all right so it's 830 now which means this appointment is officially in the past because you know it's actually just happened technically we could have made it at you know 845 once the appointments finished it goes in the past but I think this is more than fine and you can see that now when I have this past appointment there's a button that allows me to rape my service so how I felt that the service was so here you know this pumps up a little dialog I can choose the amount of stars I want to give this so maybe we'll give it five stars then it says you rated this five stars and if you click on it again you can see the rating that you gave it now I can also decide to remove this appointment from my list of past appointments so say I have a ton of different appointments here I can decide to remove that if I want to see you know my most recent ones or anything like that and then the upcoming appointment set on one anymore I can just cancel it by doing that alright so that has been 8 for my first ever Android application now don't get me wrong there's a ton of stuff that needs to be improved I'm gonna say right now for any of you guys that
