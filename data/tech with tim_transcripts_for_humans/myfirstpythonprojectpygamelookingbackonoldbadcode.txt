00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so
00:01 - we're not the YouTube video so in
00:03 - today's video what I'm going to be doing
00:05 - is reviewing / reacting to an old Python
00:08 - project of mine notice a project I made
00:10 - in grade 11 and this is actually the
00:12 - first ever real Python project of mine
00:15 - what I mean by realist it's the first
00:17 - one that I was kind of proud of it was
00:18 - the first one that I really put a lot of
00:20 - effort into and that was kind of passed
00:22 - like four or five hundred lines so
00:24 - actually something that took more than
00:25 - just a few days this took a few weeks
00:27 - and maybe actually even about a month to
00:29 - make so keep in mind I did this when I
00:30 - was about sixteen seventeen and the
00:32 - reason I'm reviewing this is because I
00:34 - know that I made so many horrible
00:37 - mistakes in the codebase and I think
00:39 - it's gonna be kind of funny to go back
00:40 - and look at how much I've changed since
00:42 - then and then point out some of those
00:44 - mistakes and hopefully by doing that you
00:46 - guys can look at a few mistakes that you
00:49 - should not make one year programming so
00:51 - with that being said let me actually go
00:52 - ahead and do a quick demo of this game
00:54 - and then after that we'll get into the
00:56 - the code review so this is the game it's
00:58 - called super mini-golf and this is
01:00 - largely inspired by a game on the App
01:03 - Store called super stickman golf I used
01:05 - to play this game all the time with my
01:07 - friends at lunch probably in grade 11
01:09 - and grade 12 and well that's why it kind
01:12 - of inspired me to make this I wanted to
01:13 - recreate my own version of it on the
01:15 - computer alright so I'm in the game now
01:17 - I'm not sure if you guys can hear the
01:18 - sound effects I have them kind of
01:19 - faintly paying in the playing in the
01:21 - background but there is some music and
01:23 - sound effects when you do specific
01:24 - things in this game and the first thing
01:26 - I'll show you is actually the ball shop
01:27 - now I won't spend too much time on it
01:29 - but here you can equip different balls
01:30 - so you can the kind of the objective is
01:33 - you collect coins and then you can
01:34 - purchase different balls and you can see
01:36 - I can equipped let's say like the
01:37 - Aqualand here so I'll use that one if I
01:39 - wanted to purchase one I could select it
01:41 - it will bring up this window and then I
01:42 - can press yes or no
01:43 - so let's actually get into the game
01:45 - we'll start my first level we can see we
01:47 - go to level 1 and I'll just play through
01:48 - level 1 so you guys get an idea of kind
01:50 - of how the physics work and the bounces
01:52 - and then I'm gonna skip through a few of
01:54 - them and show you some of the later
01:55 - levels because those ones are kind of
01:56 - cool so immediately you'll notice
01:58 - there's kind of a power bar in that
01:59 - bottom left hand corner and to shoot the
02:01 - ball it's just all with the mouse you
02:02 - press down once starts the power press
02:04 - again it locks the power and then it
02:06 - shoots you aim by just moving the mouse
02:08 - around you can go close far it doesn't
02:11 - matter and then there's power ups so
02:12 - there's power shop
02:13 - and sticky ball those the power-ups that
02:15 - you can use so you'll notice that here
02:17 - there's actually this pink or purple II
02:19 - kind of substance on the wall and that
02:21 - is a sticky pad so if you hit that you
02:23 - actually stick to it and then this laser
02:25 - does laser is another hazard so if you
02:27 - run into it you lose a stroke now I'm
02:29 - just gonna skip through all the levels
02:30 - and get to kind of the end screen here
02:32 - just to show you what that looks like
02:34 - but again a really cool game I made all
02:36 - these levels myself a little bit of
02:37 - inspiration from that original game but
02:39 - you'll see when we get to the code
02:41 - review how difficult it was to actually
02:42 - kind of design these levels even though
02:44 - it is this little 2d thing there's all
02:46 - these different objects we have to check
02:48 - for collision with and while it gets
02:49 - pretty complicated pretty fast and lets
02:52 - go and it says noobest course completed
02:54 - 40 14 strokes par 40 score negative 26
02:57 - coins collected to press the mouse to
02:59 - continue and that is the game demo so
03:02 - let's go ahead and get into the code
03:03 - review after a quick word from our
03:05 - sponsor I need to thank simply learned
03:07 - for sponsoring this video and introduce
03:08 - you to the machine learning

03:44 - integrated laps after completion of this
03:46 - course you will receive a certificate
03:48 - from simply learned to testify to your
03:50 - skills in machine learning
03:51 - get started today by hitting the link in
03:53 - the description all right so now we're
03:55 - onto the code review which is gonna be
03:57 - very interesting because I do not
03:59 - remember exactly how I wrote this code
04:01 - so it's gonna be yeah interesting to say
04:03 - the least on how I'm actually going to
04:05 - understand what's going on in here I'll
04:07 - try my best to explain it but again this
04:10 - was 3-4 years ago so god knows if I'm
04:12 - gonna remember what happened in here
04:14 - anyways we can see that I have four
04:16 - Python files here so I have courses dot
04:18 - PI main dot PI physics dot PI and start
04:21 - screened out PI this is where all the
04:23 - codes written I did not organize things
04:25 - all nicely into different classes
04:27 - with a structure which I probably should
04:29 - have done because you're gonna see that
04:30 - main dot pie is like a few thousand
04:32 - lines of code and then I have been nice
04:34 - this is just the Python virtual
04:36 - environment I have sounds at least I put
04:38 - all of the sounds in their own folder so
04:40 - there is actually music and sound
04:42 - effects for the game but I can't play
04:43 - them just cuz I don't know if they're
04:45 - copyright or not so I don't want to uh
04:46 - to risk that and then images these are
04:49 - all the images of all the different
04:50 - things in there so like the icon like
04:53 - the laser there was some other levels
04:55 - where I added some more things that we
04:57 - didn't see the power bar sand the title
05:01 - right water all these different things
05:03 - so that is all the images and now let's
05:05 - actually just get started on let's keep
05:07 - the smaller module first so this is the
05:10 - physics module so as you noticed all of
05:13 - the stuff in this game actually worked
05:15 - off of like pretty realistic physics
05:16 - like the bounce was working pretty good
05:18 - flying through the air was working
05:20 - pretty well and this is based strictly
05:21 - off of projectile motion which you learn
05:24 - in grade 11 so since I actually knew
05:26 - projectile motion because I was pretty
05:27 - good at physics in high school I was
05:29 - able to actually implement a fairly
05:31 - realistic kind of physics simulator that
05:33 - I wrote from scratch I didn't use any
05:35 - module or anything from this and this
05:36 - was the main kind of I don't know module
05:39 - or brains behind the physics so ball
05:41 - paths we have a start X a start Y a
05:44 - power and an angle and the amount of
05:46 - time and this simply calculates at what
05:49 - like what coordinate this ball should be
05:51 - at given it start at this X that Y had a
05:54 - power angle and time and then of course
05:55 - gravity is built in at negative 9.8
05:58 - meters per second which I probably
05:59 - should have changed that but actually I
06:00 - ended up working fairly well for this
06:02 - project so you can see this is ball path
06:04 - that's what that function does find
06:06 - power this just finds the amount of
06:08 - power based on where that line was on
06:11 - the power meter because that angle the
06:14 - angle off the line determines how much
06:16 - power are you gonna shoot with so I had
06:17 - to figure that out in here find angle I
06:20 - don't actually know what that does I
06:23 - don't remember and then max time don't
06:25 - remember what that does either but those
06:27 - were this is like the physics module and
06:29 - now I'll go into maned up high and then
06:30 - I'll talk about the other ones so maned
06:32 - up high let me just scroll through here
06:34 - is what is it oh yes oh it's a thousand
06:37 - lines of code so I exaggerated a bit but
06:39 - it is a signal
06:40 - an amount of code considering none of
06:42 - its like broken up into functions at all
06:44 - it's just this massive massive while
06:47 - statement others too so there's one for
06:49 - the Start screen and then there's one
06:50 - that just boom for the entire main game
06:52 - loop so you can imagine that like if I
06:54 - want to fix anything oh my god this is
06:57 - gonna be like literally impossible
06:58 - trying to figure out where anything is
07:00 - because there's like Elif Elif Elif Elif
07:03 - Elif Elif everywhere so not the most
07:06 - readable thing well we'll start from the
07:07 - top to bottom and then we'll keep going
07:08 - alright so I load up all the stuff I'm
07:10 - fine with this all these images I
07:13 - probably have made these capitals as
07:14 - they're constants but that's fine we
07:16 - have our global variables here yeah I
07:21 - didn't put anything in classes this was
07:23 - all like this is a very functional was
07:26 - it very functional program if you want
07:28 - to put it that way
07:29 - and yeah so loading all the music power
07:31 - up variables fonts and there is one
07:36 - class I guess I wrote which is the score
07:37 - sheet so let's have a look at this all
07:39 - right so so par with two R's nice okay
07:43 - self dot parlous par I'm not seeing
07:45 - anything that's like hurting my head too
07:47 - horribly except for these just massive
07:50 - methods so draw sheet I mean I'm okay
07:52 - with this but I really don't like seeing
07:55 - huge blocks of code where they're
07:56 - definitely doing more than one thing and
07:58 - like that's the huge thing with this
07:59 - this program here this is just this huge
08:02 - blocks and just chunks of code and I I
08:04 - can't immediately tell you what all
08:06 - these things they're doing and and these
08:07 - kind of things but should probably have
08:09 - gone in their own method at least so
08:11 - they would have been easier to change
08:12 - and mess around although I did add some
08:14 - decent comments so setup grid column
08:16 - lines rows display all headers for rows
08:18 - so at least I did that so that's not
08:20 - horrible catch the index out of range
08:22 - error display strokes each level mmm try
08:25 - catch I don't know why I needed that but
08:27 - I guess I did and then we go down to
08:29 - error so this is displays an error
08:32 - message if you try to buy yeah out of
08:34 - power-ups you have no more powers
08:35 - remaining for this course okay so that's
08:37 - what that does n screen this is what
08:40 - handles the main loop for the end screen
08:41 - again right like just all this code oh
08:44 - my god
08:45 - rewrite the text file containing the
08:47 - scores draw all the stuff on the screen
08:49 - I should have put that in its own
08:50 - function global variables
08:53 - we don't want to do that do we but a
08:54 - bunch of global variables so obviously
08:56 - nothing in this project we can take out
08:58 - and reuse it's all just now completely
09:01 - tied together there's no chance that we
09:03 - can even take small sections of this
09:05 - other than the physics module and move
09:07 - it anywhere so that's an absolute mess
09:09 - old score old coins file okay I am
09:13 - noticing that when I name variables I'm
09:15 - not doing camelcase
09:17 - or underscores I'm just doing if you
09:19 - guys can see here the actual name which
09:22 - is not usually a good thing to be doing
09:23 - I have a lot of like one letter variable
09:26 - names which just make it really hard to
09:28 - read like F L wouldn't be doing that
09:31 - anymore Co like I have no idea what Co
09:34 - stands for and I probably could have
09:36 - named that something more descriptive
09:38 - wait okay
09:40 - while loop for events yeah like just a
09:43 - lot of stuff that just doesn't make any
09:44 - sense when you come back and read it
09:46 - which is obviously something you want to
09:47 - avoid and then this just massive
09:49 - diagonal code indentation levels so
09:52 - let's try to decipher some of this set
09:55 - up level okay and maybe that makes sense
09:57 - starting shop click ok so this is
10:00 - handling the main menu it looks like
10:03 - potentially any ways set up what is this
10:06 - view set up set up objects for the level
10:08 - from module courses okay so now what I'm
10:10 - gonna do is go to courses and show you
10:12 - how I actually built these courses so
10:14 - notice that I had like all the lines
10:16 - there and I had these just notice what
10:19 - the levels looked like there was
10:20 - platforms and there was like a sand trap
10:22 - and there was a flag well you're gonna
10:23 - see how I decided to do that so this is
10:27 - courses DUP I yeah just just here you
10:32 - guys can just just look so what I
10:35 - actually did is I defined objects by
10:39 - strings so like a floor was denoted by
10:42 - floor and that corresponds to the image
10:44 - here which is where sit do we have a
10:48 - floor somewhere platform floor green
10:52 - icon laser power tile title water sticky
10:56 - sand edge sand bottom so sand bottom
10:59 - potentially I don't know there's
11:00 - something that was a floor like
11:01 - something is a floor one of the images
11:03 - anyways so if we go back to courses top
11:06 - I though
11:07 - you can see that I denote what the
11:09 - object was by string and then I put the
11:11 - position that I want it to be at so 0
11:14 - negative 8 1224 okay so I believe what
11:18 - I'm saying here is the this is gonna be
11:22 - the X I believe this is the Y and I
11:25 - believe this is how long and how high it
11:26 - is yeah I think that's what it is so
11:28 - this is X Y width height that's what I'm
11:31 - defining here and you can see I have
11:33 - hard-coded window width and window
11:34 - height up here which is just not a good
11:36 - thing to do and I'm using those
11:37 - variables up here so no you cannot
11:39 - change the window height and the width
11:40 - and I literally went in and manually
11:42 - added all of the objects rather than
11:45 - building some kind of like level builder
11:47 - or something which probably would have
11:48 - been easier and then I put all of them
11:50 - in a list for the courses so course 1 is
11:53 - denoted by just all of this and if you
11:55 - want to move anything well have fun
11:57 - trying to figure out where they are
11:58 - heart and what is what I have these
12:00 - functions in here that are meant to just
12:02 - help get you like a few things from
12:04 - these levels so they get you the par
12:06 - they get you whatever you like whatever
12:09 - else is here gets start Oh getting the
12:11 - start position that's because inside of
12:13 - all of these I have something that's
12:14 - labeled to start I believe let's see if
12:17 - there's anything called start well maybe
12:19 - not but there's like there's some way
12:22 - that we define like where people start
12:24 - and where the green is and where the
12:25 - flags are and all of that that's just a
12:27 - mess that's courses PI yeah and so set
12:31 - up I guess is handling some of that the
12:33 - course is up I couldn't even tell you
12:35 - and then I have some other functions
12:36 - here so fade fade up the screen when
12:38 - player gets hit by ball show score
12:40 - display the score from the class score
12:41 - sheet so these are ok I'm actually ok
12:43 - with some of these functions I can live
12:44 - with these one one if a player gets a
12:47 - hole-in-one display a special message
12:48 - screen ok that's fine I can do that ah
12:50 - displays stroke okay so this is based on
12:54 - what you get versus the par it gives you
12:57 - all of the the names right so like oh I
13:00 - didn't even know what these were what
13:01 - things albatraoz negative for skipped
13:03 - Eagle birdie par bogey double bogey
13:06 - triple bogey so on and then plus
13:08 - whatever that's okay redraw window this
13:11 - is meant to handle all the redrawing so
13:13 - this actually uses that courses you can
13:15 - see I have sand water edge bottom flag
13:17 - floor green wall laser sticky coin and
13:19 - then of course there's a ball
13:21 - somewhere that I'm drawing although I
13:23 - don't know where it is but essentially I
13:25 - just load in a list of objects and then
13:27 - draw all of them based on what string
13:29 - they have using the correct image so
13:31 - that's how this draw thing works I mean
13:33 - I couldn't really come up with a better
13:34 - way to do that now I probably would but
13:38 - that's how I went about doing it
13:39 - coin image this calculates the spinning
13:41 - coin so how it spins
13:42 - PowerBar this handles out power by
13:45 - moving back and forth find angle I think
13:48 - is a duplicate of something else
13:49 - oh no find the angle that the ball hits
13:51 - the ground out so good I have that
13:52 - comment but that's actually pretty hard
13:54 - to do if you think about it like you
13:56 - have this ball which is a circular
13:57 - object first of all that's coming down
13:59 - and then you got to figure out what
14:00 - angle it hit set so you can bounce off
14:02 - at the corresponding angle and then
14:04 - reduce power core accordingly so that's
14:07 - interesting on green this tells us if
14:09 - we're on the green because if we're on
14:11 - the green you go into puttting mode so
14:13 - we need to know if that's true over
14:15 - whole this tells us if the ball is over
14:18 - the hole so that we know if it went in
14:19 - or not so that's interesting and now
14:22 - yeah we get into this main game loop
14:25 - collision a ball looking angle locking
14:28 - angle and power checking if powerup
14:30 - buttons are clicked shooting the ball
14:31 - using physics module keeping track of
14:33 - strokes and calls all functions and uses
14:35 - module slash class is important to find
14:36 - above yeah so like we should not do all
14:39 - of that in one area which is what I did
14:41 - but you can see that like this is just
14:43 - an absolute mess so this is the screen
14:45 - the Start screen sorry and what do we do
14:48 - Start screen
14:49 - main screen so I believe if I go to
14:52 - Start screen
14:53 - ball so class ball okay interesting I
14:57 - didn't even use a capital there and
14:59 - where's the Start screen somewhere in
15:02 - here main screen so I believe that
15:04 - displays some stuff mouse over like
15:07 - there's just so much code it's hard to
15:10 - wrap my head around all of it now but
15:12 - draw shop oh my gosh just whenever you
15:15 - see these cascading if statements it
15:17 - just can never be a good thing and I
15:18 - just yeah I'm not gonna skip that
15:20 - anyways let's go back here so display
15:23 - Start screen okay and so we say this
15:25 - Start screen works we get past that now
15:27 - we get into like the core of this is the
15:29 - most difficult part by far this main
15:31 - loop which actually handles all the
15:32 - physics so first of all this is Han
15:35 - all the power-ups so depending on which
15:37 - one you hit do something right and I
15:40 - don't even know what all these x4 like
15:43 - what is X I don't I don't know what that
15:45 - is I shouldn't have used one letter
15:48 - variable names for X in powerup buttons
15:50 - yeah this is just so interesting I don't
15:52 - I don't know what those are event dot
15:55 - type so this is if you press the mouse
15:57 - button down we can see that this is
16:00 - checking the collision of the powerup
16:01 - buttons and then this is clicking if you
16:04 - click the powerup buttons but you don't
16:05 - lock the angle then it doesn't work so
16:07 - you have to actually lock the angle
16:09 - first if we haven't locked powers stay
16:11 - in this loop until we do so this is
16:13 - waiting for you to actually lock the
16:15 - power for that arm to spit to go back
16:17 - and forth change the position of the
16:20 - angle line so this is Mouse motion what
16:23 - the heck oh so that's based on if I move
16:27 - my mouse left or right that changes how
16:29 - that power bar moves so that's there's a
16:31 - lot of complicated stuff here
16:32 - redraw window crates and now another
16:35 - while loop so while putt and not shoot
16:37 - so if you're putting but we aren't in
16:39 - the shooting mode yet and if we aren't
16:41 - over the hole then do this otherwise do
16:45 - all of this right so you can just see
16:46 - that this is a mess like at least I
16:47 - commented it so I can read it but it's
16:49 - just so many things happening in one
16:51 - place and so many horrible names and
16:53 - inconsistency like I'm using camelcase
16:55 - here and then I use snake case other
16:57 - places and then I have just s like that
16:59 - with no camel case at all all these
17:02 - random constants throwing up like just
17:05 - these magic numbers everywhere like Pi
17:07 - game time ductile 8:20 like Y 20 why did
17:09 - I pick 20 I have no idea while shoot so
17:13 - while we're in the shooting mode so now
17:14 - this is responsible for actually moving
17:16 - the ball which is oh my gosh yeah
17:18 - collision loop very complex I love how I
17:22 - stated that so if as if everything else
17:24 - wasn't to fix glitch where you go
17:25 - through walls and floors great right
17:27 - like this is these are my solutions to
17:29 - common problems to just comment in all
17:31 - capitals this fixes the glitch don't
17:34 - remove it to leave it there okay
17:36 - collision loop very complex all angles
17:38 - are in radians physics are in jet in
17:40 - general real and correct that's actually
17:41 - true I know I did a decent job on the
17:43 - physics and oh my god so if I for equals
17:46 - coins so if we collided with a
17:48 - coin then check if we collided and do
17:52 - this if we collided with a laser check
17:55 - the exact same thing we did up here
17:56 - except with the laser and do all of this
17:59 - if we collided with water that do all of
18:02 - this we're I'm sure like most of this is
18:04 - the same stuff that I've just repeated
18:06 - like in all of these loops if we hit the
18:08 - flag where we hit the coin do all of
18:10 - this and recalculate the angles and all
18:12 - of that it's just so much reused and
18:14 - repetitive code and it just makes it
18:16 - like we can see here literally
18:17 - impossible to understand at all so
18:20 - honestly with that I feel like I've
18:22 - probably dragged this video on long
18:24 - enough I could go through and review
18:25 - this for like hours and talk about it
18:27 - but I just wanted to to show you guys
18:29 - that what my first kind of real Python
18:32 - project looked like an absolute mess no
18:35 - idea of design practices I used like one
18:37 - class or two classes inside of here I
18:40 - had no idea the proper way to do this
18:42 - and I just jumped into this huge project
18:44 - with no real planning and well you can
18:46 - see that it just turned into something
18:48 - that's really cool that I'm definitely
18:49 - still proud of that I was able to create
18:50 - but just an absolute colossal mess and
18:53 - this should show you why it's hopefully
18:55 - important that you're applying good
18:57 - practices when you're coding so that if
18:59 - you want to look back at a project in
19:01 - two years you have some idea what the
19:03 - heck is going on
19:04 - so anyways with that being said I hope
19:05 - you all enjoyed if you did make sure you
19:07 - leave a like subscribe to the channel
19:09 - and let me know what you thought of my
19:11 - first Python project

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so we're not the YouTube video so in today's video what I'm going to be doing is reviewing / reacting to an old Python project of mine notice a project I made in grade 11 and this is actually the first ever real Python project of mine what I mean by realist it's the first one that I was kind of proud of it was the first one that I really put a lot of effort into and that was kind of passed like four or five hundred lines so actually something that took more than just a few days this took a few weeks and maybe actually even about a month to make so keep in mind I did this when I was about sixteen seventeen and the reason I'm reviewing this is because I know that I made so many horrible mistakes in the codebase and I think it's gonna be kind of funny to go back and look at how much I've changed since then and then point out some of those mistakes and hopefully by doing that you guys can look at a few mistakes that you should not make one year programming so with that being said let me actually go ahead and do a quick demo of this game and then after that we'll get into the the code review so this is the game it's called super minigolf and this is largely inspired by a game on the App Store called super stickman golf I used to play this game all the time with my friends at lunch probably in grade 11 and grade 12 and well that's why it kind of inspired me to make this I wanted to recreate my own version of it on the computer alright so I'm in the game now I'm not sure if you guys can hear the sound effects I have them kind of faintly paying in the playing in the background but there is some music and sound effects when you do specific things in this game and the first thing I'll show you is actually the ball shop now I won't spend too much time on it but here you can equip different balls so you can the kind of the objective is you collect coins and then you can purchase different balls and you can see I can equipped let's say like the Aqualand here so I'll use that one if I wanted to purchase one I could select it it will bring up this window and then I can press yes or no so let's actually get into the game we'll start my first level we can see we go to level 1 and I'll just play through level 1 so you guys get an idea of kind of how the physics work and the bounces and then I'm gonna skip through a few of them and show you some of the later levels because those ones are kind of cool so immediately you'll notice there's kind of a power bar in that bottom left hand corner and to shoot the ball it's just all with the mouse you press down once starts the power press again it locks the power and then it shoots you aim by just moving the mouse around you can go close far it doesn't matter and then there's power ups so there's power shop and sticky ball those the powerups that you can use so you'll notice that here there's actually this pink or purple II kind of substance on the wall and that is a sticky pad so if you hit that you actually stick to it and then this laser does laser is another hazard so if you run into it you lose a stroke now I'm just gonna skip through all the levels and get to kind of the end screen here just to show you what that looks like but again a really cool game I made all these levels myself a little bit of inspiration from that original game but you'll see when we get to the code review how difficult it was to actually kind of design these levels even though it is this little 2d thing there's all these different objects we have to check for collision with and while it gets pretty complicated pretty fast and lets go and it says noobest course completed 40 14 strokes par 40 score negative 26 coins collected to press the mouse to continue and that is the game demo so let's go ahead and get into the code review after a quick word from our sponsor I need to thank simply learned for sponsoring this video and introduce you to the machine learning certification course this course incorporates fifty eight hours of selfpaced learning live virtual classes and 24/7 teaching assistants all in combinations with a high engagement online classroom environment this job oriented training focuses on preparing you for the real world and giving you lots of handson experience you'll work with realtime data will develop and analyze algorithms and learn indemand machine learning skills like time series modeling decision trees unsupervised learning kmeans clustering deep learning and much more you'll master these skills through handson exercises for reallife industry projects and integrated laps after completion of this course you will receive a certificate from simply learned to testify to your skills in machine learning get started today by hitting the link in the description all right so now we're onto the code review which is gonna be very interesting because I do not remember exactly how I wrote this code so it's gonna be yeah interesting to say the least on how I'm actually going to understand what's going on in here I'll try my best to explain it but again this was 34 years ago so god knows if I'm gonna remember what happened in here anyways we can see that I have four Python files here so I have courses dot PI main dot PI physics dot PI and start screened out PI this is where all the codes written I did not organize things all nicely into different classes with a structure which I probably should have done because you're gonna see that main dot pie is like a few thousand lines of code and then I have been nice this is just the Python virtual environment I have sounds at least I put all of the sounds in their own folder so there is actually music and sound effects for the game but I can't play them just cuz I don't know if they're copyright or not so I don't want to uh to risk that and then images these are all the images of all the different things in there so like the icon like the laser there was some other levels where I added some more things that we didn't see the power bar sand the title right water all these different things so that is all the images and now let's actually just get started on let's keep the smaller module first so this is the physics module so as you noticed all of the stuff in this game actually worked off of like pretty realistic physics like the bounce was working pretty good flying through the air was working pretty well and this is based strictly off of projectile motion which you learn in grade 11 so since I actually knew projectile motion because I was pretty good at physics in high school I was able to actually implement a fairly realistic kind of physics simulator that I wrote from scratch I didn't use any module or anything from this and this was the main kind of I don't know module or brains behind the physics so ball paths we have a start X a start Y a power and an angle and the amount of time and this simply calculates at what like what coordinate this ball should be at given it start at this X that Y had a power angle and time and then of course gravity is built in at negative 9.8 meters per second which I probably should have changed that but actually I ended up working fairly well for this project so you can see this is ball path that's what that function does find power this just finds the amount of power based on where that line was on the power meter because that angle the angle off the line determines how much power are you gonna shoot with so I had to figure that out in here find angle I don't actually know what that does I don't remember and then max time don't remember what that does either but those were this is like the physics module and now I'll go into maned up high and then I'll talk about the other ones so maned up high let me just scroll through here is what is it oh yes oh it's a thousand lines of code so I exaggerated a bit but it is a signal an amount of code considering none of its like broken up into functions at all it's just this massive massive while statement others too so there's one for the Start screen and then there's one that just boom for the entire main game loop so you can imagine that like if I want to fix anything oh my god this is gonna be like literally impossible trying to figure out where anything is because there's like Elif Elif Elif Elif Elif Elif everywhere so not the most readable thing well we'll start from the top to bottom and then we'll keep going alright so I load up all the stuff I'm fine with this all these images I probably have made these capitals as they're constants but that's fine we have our global variables here yeah I didn't put anything in classes this was all like this is a very functional was it very functional program if you want to put it that way and yeah so loading all the music power up variables fonts and there is one class I guess I wrote which is the score sheet so let's have a look at this all right so so par with two R's nice okay self dot parlous par I'm not seeing anything that's like hurting my head too horribly except for these just massive methods so draw sheet I mean I'm okay with this but I really don't like seeing huge blocks of code where they're definitely doing more than one thing and like that's the huge thing with this this program here this is just this huge blocks and just chunks of code and I I can't immediately tell you what all these things they're doing and and these kind of things but should probably have gone in their own method at least so they would have been easier to change and mess around although I did add some decent comments so setup grid column lines rows display all headers for rows so at least I did that so that's not horrible catch the index out of range error display strokes each level mmm try catch I don't know why I needed that but I guess I did and then we go down to error so this is displays an error message if you try to buy yeah out of powerups you have no more powers remaining for this course okay so that's what that does n screen this is what handles the main loop for the end screen again right like just all this code oh my god rewrite the text file containing the scores draw all the stuff on the screen I should have put that in its own function global variables we don't want to do that do we but a bunch of global variables so obviously nothing in this project we can take out and reuse it's all just now completely tied together there's no chance that we can even take small sections of this other than the physics module and move it anywhere so that's an absolute mess old score old coins file okay I am noticing that when I name variables I'm not doing camelcase or underscores I'm just doing if you guys can see here the actual name which is not usually a good thing to be doing I have a lot of like one letter variable names which just make it really hard to read like F L wouldn't be doing that anymore Co like I have no idea what Co stands for and I probably could have named that something more descriptive wait okay while loop for events yeah like just a lot of stuff that just doesn't make any sense when you come back and read it which is obviously something you want to avoid and then this just massive diagonal code indentation levels so let's try to decipher some of this set up level okay and maybe that makes sense starting shop click ok so this is handling the main menu it looks like potentially any ways set up what is this view set up set up objects for the level from module courses okay so now what I'm gonna do is go to courses and show you how I actually built these courses so notice that I had like all the lines there and I had these just notice what the levels looked like there was platforms and there was like a sand trap and there was a flag well you're gonna see how I decided to do that so this is courses DUP I yeah just just here you guys can just just look so what I actually did is I defined objects by strings so like a floor was denoted by floor and that corresponds to the image here which is where sit do we have a floor somewhere platform floor green icon laser power tile title water sticky sand edge sand bottom so sand bottom potentially I don't know there's something that was a floor like something is a floor one of the images anyways so if we go back to courses top I though you can see that I denote what the object was by string and then I put the position that I want it to be at so 0 negative 8 1224 okay so I believe what I'm saying here is the this is gonna be the X I believe this is the Y and I believe this is how long and how high it is yeah I think that's what it is so this is X Y width height that's what I'm defining here and you can see I have hardcoded window width and window height up here which is just not a good thing to do and I'm using those variables up here so no you cannot change the window height and the width and I literally went in and manually added all of the objects rather than building some kind of like level builder or something which probably would have been easier and then I put all of them in a list for the courses so course 1 is denoted by just all of this and if you want to move anything well have fun trying to figure out where they are heart and what is what I have these functions in here that are meant to just help get you like a few things from these levels so they get you the par they get you whatever you like whatever else is here gets start Oh getting the start position that's because inside of all of these I have something that's labeled to start I believe let's see if there's anything called start well maybe not but there's like there's some way that we define like where people start and where the green is and where the flags are and all of that that's just a mess that's courses PI yeah and so set up I guess is handling some of that the course is up I couldn't even tell you and then I have some other functions here so fade fade up the screen when player gets hit by ball show score display the score from the class score sheet so these are ok I'm actually ok with some of these functions I can live with these one one if a player gets a holeinone display a special message screen ok that's fine I can do that ah displays stroke okay so this is based on what you get versus the par it gives you all of the the names right so like oh I didn't even know what these were what things albatraoz negative for skipped Eagle birdie par bogey double bogey triple bogey so on and then plus whatever that's okay redraw window this is meant to handle all the redrawing so this actually uses that courses you can see I have sand water edge bottom flag floor green wall laser sticky coin and then of course there's a ball somewhere that I'm drawing although I don't know where it is but essentially I just load in a list of objects and then draw all of them based on what string they have using the correct image so that's how this draw thing works I mean I couldn't really come up with a better way to do that now I probably would but that's how I went about doing it coin image this calculates the spinning coin so how it spins PowerBar this handles out power by moving back and forth find angle I think is a duplicate of something else oh no find the angle that the ball hits the ground out so good I have that comment but that's actually pretty hard to do if you think about it like you have this ball which is a circular object first of all that's coming down and then you got to figure out what angle it hit set so you can bounce off at the corresponding angle and then reduce power core accordingly so that's interesting on green this tells us if we're on the green because if we're on the green you go into puttting mode so we need to know if that's true over whole this tells us if the ball is over the hole so that we know if it went in or not so that's interesting and now yeah we get into this main game loop collision a ball looking angle locking angle and power checking if powerup buttons are clicked shooting the ball using physics module keeping track of strokes and calls all functions and uses module slash class is important to find above yeah so like we should not do all of that in one area which is what I did but you can see that like this is just an absolute mess so this is the screen the Start screen sorry and what do we do Start screen main screen so I believe if I go to Start screen ball so class ball okay interesting I didn't even use a capital there and where's the Start screen somewhere in here main screen so I believe that displays some stuff mouse over like there's just so much code it's hard to wrap my head around all of it now but draw shop oh my gosh just whenever you see these cascading if statements it just can never be a good thing and I just yeah I'm not gonna skip that anyways let's go back here so display Start screen okay and so we say this Start screen works we get past that now we get into like the core of this is the most difficult part by far this main loop which actually handles all the physics so first of all this is Han all the powerups so depending on which one you hit do something right and I don't even know what all these x4 like what is X I don't I don't know what that is I shouldn't have used one letter variable names for X in powerup buttons yeah this is just so interesting I don't I don't know what those are event dot type so this is if you press the mouse button down we can see that this is checking the collision of the powerup buttons and then this is clicking if you click the powerup buttons but you don't lock the angle then it doesn't work so you have to actually lock the angle first if we haven't locked powers stay in this loop until we do so this is waiting for you to actually lock the power for that arm to spit to go back and forth change the position of the angle line so this is Mouse motion what the heck oh so that's based on if I move my mouse left or right that changes how that power bar moves so that's there's a lot of complicated stuff here redraw window crates and now another while loop so while putt and not shoot so if you're putting but we aren't in the shooting mode yet and if we aren't over the hole then do this otherwise do all of this right so you can just see that this is a mess like at least I commented it so I can read it but it's just so many things happening in one place and so many horrible names and inconsistency like I'm using camelcase here and then I use snake case other places and then I have just s like that with no camel case at all all these random constants throwing up like just these magic numbers everywhere like Pi game time ductile 820 like Y 20 why did I pick 20 I have no idea while shoot so while we're in the shooting mode so now this is responsible for actually moving the ball which is oh my gosh yeah collision loop very complex I love how I stated that so if as if everything else wasn't to fix glitch where you go through walls and floors great right like this is these are my solutions to common problems to just comment in all capitals this fixes the glitch don't remove it to leave it there okay collision loop very complex all angles are in radians physics are in jet in general real and correct that's actually true I know I did a decent job on the physics and oh my god so if I for equals coins so if we collided with a coin then check if we collided and do this if we collided with a laser check the exact same thing we did up here except with the laser and do all of this if we collided with water that do all of this we're I'm sure like most of this is the same stuff that I've just repeated like in all of these loops if we hit the flag where we hit the coin do all of this and recalculate the angles and all of that it's just so much reused and repetitive code and it just makes it like we can see here literally impossible to understand at all so honestly with that I feel like I've probably dragged this video on long enough I could go through and review this for like hours and talk about it but I just wanted to to show you guys that what my first kind of real Python project looked like an absolute mess no idea of design practices I used like one class or two classes inside of here I had no idea the proper way to do this and I just jumped into this huge project with no real planning and well you can see that it just turned into something that's really cool that I'm definitely still proud of that I was able to create but just an absolute colossal mess and this should show you why it's hopefully important that you're applying good practices when you're coding so that if you want to look back at a project in two years you have some idea what the heck is going on so anyways with that being said I hope you all enjoyed if you did make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and let me know what you thought of my first Python project
