00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video in this video i'll be
00:03 - sharing with you five great python
00:05 - modules that i recommend for beginners
00:08 - these modules are relatively simple to
00:10 - use but allow you to go beyond
00:11 - text-based apps
00:12 - and create 2d graphical applications
00:14 - with python
00:15 - i also happen to have tutorial series
00:17 - for all of the modules that i'll list
00:18 - so feel free to check those out from the
00:20 - links in the description and with that
00:22 - said
00:22 - let's dive in
00:32 - so the first module i have for you is
00:33 - called turtle this is a built-in module
00:36 - in python that allows you to create very
00:38 - simple 2d drawing applications
00:40 - you're given a canvas and a cursor the
00:42 - cursor is also known as the turtle and
00:44 - you can run commands to move the turtle
00:45 - around the screen
00:46 - change its position its speed color etc
00:49 - as the turtle moves a line will be drawn
00:51 - to represent its path
00:52 - and you can use this to create simple
00:54 - drawings shapes fractals and a lot more
00:56 - stuff
00:56 - some of the programs that i've worked on
00:58 - with the turtle module include a turtle
01:00 - racing game where a set of turtles
01:01 - randomly move
01:02 - up and down the screen and race each
01:03 - other a fractal art generator that
01:06 - creates fractal trees and snowflakes
01:08 - a program that allows the user to move
01:10 - the turtle around with key presses and a
01:12 - bunch of other stuff
01:12 - as well if you'd like to learn more
01:14 - about the turtle module you can check
01:15 - out the series i have on this channel
01:17 - the one that's popping up on the screen
01:18 - right now and will be linked in the
01:20 - description
01:20 - all right so the next module i have for
01:22 - you is my all-time favorite python
01:24 - module i'm sure many of you are already
01:25 - guessing this right now
01:27 - but that is pygame pygame is an
01:29 - absolutely amazing module for creating
01:31 - 2d games in python
01:33 - i've created tons of projects with
01:35 - pygame on this channel
01:36 - ranging from simple stuff like hangman
01:38 - to physics simulators and full-fledged
01:40 - tower defense games
01:42 - i even have full tutorials on this
01:43 - channel for tetris snake
01:45 - checkers flappy bird with built-in ai
01:48 - and even an online multiplayer rock
01:50 - paper scissors game
01:51 - pie game is great because you can create
01:52 - very simple games or you can take it to
01:55 - the next level
01:56 - and make super advanced stuff like
01:57 - platformers and online games
01:59 - i've links my beginner pie game tutorial
02:00 - series in the description if you guys
02:02 - want to get started with that
02:03 - but of course there's tons of resources
02:05 - on my channel and on the internet in
02:06 - general
02:07 - to learn pygame i would highly recommend
02:09 - it for anyone that's kind of getting
02:10 - into python and wants to create some
02:12 - more interesting applications
02:13 - so the next thing i have for you here is
02:15 - a web automation framework
02:17 - called selenium so selenium is the name
02:19 - of the module selenium allows you to
02:21 - create bots that can control and scrape
02:23 - data from websites
02:24 - it's mostly used for doing ui testing of
02:27 - websites but you can make it play games
02:29 - fill in login information fill in forms
02:32 - go and scrape data from websites and
02:34 - kind of pull that into an application
02:35 - there's a lot of stuff you can do with
02:37 - selenium
02:37 - now an example of an interesting
02:39 - selenium project i worked on is actually
02:40 - a bot that can
02:42 - play the game cookie clickers so you
02:43 - have to press this cookie a bunch of
02:45 - times then you can upgrade the speed at
02:47 - which
02:47 - you can press the cookie and all kinds
02:48 - of stuff like that anyways if you want
02:50 - to see how that project works
02:52 - i have a whole tutorial series on
02:53 - selenium and the last video in that
02:55 - series
02:56 - actually goes through creating that bot
02:58 - and showing you how you can make a
03:00 - selenium web driver that's what it's
03:01 - called
03:02 - actually play a game on a website so the
03:05 - next module on my list is called
03:06 - discord.pi
03:08 - this is a module that allows you to
03:09 - create discord bots you can get up and
03:11 - running with it in minutes and easily
03:12 - create commands respond to messages and
03:15 - pings
03:15 - and much more my discord server which
03:18 - you guys should join by the way i'll
03:19 - have a link in the description for that
03:20 - has a very advanced discord bot running
03:22 - hundreds of commands
03:24 - moderation polls an integrated database
03:26 - and much more
03:27 - i do actually have a series on creating
03:29 - a discord bot using this module but
03:32 - unfortunately it's outdated now as
03:33 - there's a new version of discord.pi
03:35 - so you can still check it out if you
03:36 - want from the link in the description
03:38 - but if you guys want me to make a new
03:39 - version of this series then leave a
03:41 - comment
03:42 - and let me know and i'll consider doing
03:43 - that last thing i'll mention if you guys
03:45 - are interested in some open source
03:46 - projects i have a lot going on
03:48 - in my discord server so make sure you
03:50 - join that there's actually kind of a
03:52 - section or a bunch of channels related
03:54 - to all those projects
03:55 - so you guys can actually contribute and
03:56 - work on the website and the api and a
03:58 - ton of other stuff we have going on in
03:59 - there
04:00 - now finally my list ends with the kivi
04:03 - module so kivy is a module that allows
04:05 - you to make cross-platform
04:06 - graphical user applications with python
04:09 - it's definitely not the easiest to get
04:11 - this code to run on mobile devices but
04:13 - it is possible to use this module to
04:15 - make ios and android applications
04:17 - with purely python and one code base
04:20 - works for all of these different
04:21 - platforms there's very little that you
04:22 - actually have to change
04:23 - now regardless of the mobile app
04:25 - possibilities for this module
04:27 - it's great for making simple user
04:28 - interfaces forms displaying video or
04:31 - photos displaying data and a lot more
04:33 - you can also make games with this module
04:35 - but i see it being more valuable for
04:37 - utility-based applications
04:38 - where you're collecting information from
04:40 - the user or presenting some type of data
04:42 - regardless it's a great module to add to
04:44 - your repertoire like all the other
04:46 - modules i do have a tutorial series for
04:48 - this
04:48 - which you can find linked in the
04:49 - description all right so with that said
04:51 - that is going to conclude the five
04:53 - python modules i recommend for beginners
04:56 - of course there's a lot more that i
04:57 - could add to this list but these are the
04:59 - top five that i came up with when i was
05:00 - planning this video
05:01 - so let me know what your favorite module
05:03 - is on this list and if you think i
05:04 - missed any important ones leave a
05:06 - comment if that's the case
05:08 - anyways hope you guys enjoyed this video
05:09 - if you did make sure to leave a like
05:11 - subscribe and i will see you in another
05:14 - [Music]
05:20 - one
