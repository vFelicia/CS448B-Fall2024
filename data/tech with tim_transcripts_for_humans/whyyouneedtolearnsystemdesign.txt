00:00 - so moving on I have the topic of system
00:02 - design it kind of encompasses a lot of
00:04 - different stuff and system design could
00:06 - mean like designing different servers
00:08 - designing a database it could also mean
00:09 - designing different classes functions
00:12 - modules Etc that you're going to have
00:14 - inside of a code base I think it's
00:16 - important for most programmers to have a
00:18 - kind of General sense of what is meant
00:20 - by System design the process of doing
00:22 - that how you look at a system as a whole
00:24 - and kind of break that into sub
00:25 - components just keeping some kind of
00:27 - structure to make sure your code is
00:29 - somewhat maintainable and you have some
00:31 - kind of method to the madness when
00:33 - you're writing a ton of code or a
00:34 - feature
