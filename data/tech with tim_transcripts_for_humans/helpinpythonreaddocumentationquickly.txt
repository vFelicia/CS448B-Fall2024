With timestamps:

00:00 - a lot of times when you're writing code
00:01 - especially writing code in python you
00:03 - want to look at the documentation for a
00:05 - specific function module object whatever
00:07 - it may be but you don't want to have to
00:09 - go online or maybe you don't have access
00:11 - to the internet well in python there is
00:13 - a helpful function that you can use
00:15 - called help now what help takes in is
00:17 - any python object so i could pass
00:19 - something like say the sum function and
00:21 - what this will do is actually give me
00:23 - the documentation for this function so
00:25 - it prints out the docs string and then
00:27 - tells me what the arguments are now i
00:29 - can also use this on my own custom
00:31 - function so in this case i defined a doc
00:33 - string in my function and if i go here
00:35 - and i print help on my underscore
00:37 - function notice i get a message here
00:38 - that's generated by python where it
00:40 - shows me the arguments or parameters for
00:42 - this function and then the dock string
00:44 - hopefully this was helpful if it was
00:46 - make sure to follow for more
