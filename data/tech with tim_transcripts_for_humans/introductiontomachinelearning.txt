00:03 - foreign
00:09 - tools like chat GPT exist and all of a
00:12 - sudden a lot of you want to dive into
00:14 - machine learning and artificial
00:15 - intelligence now I'm not here to
00:17 - validate that decision or to tell you
00:19 - that's the best possible path to go down
00:20 - but I am here to provide you a road map
00:23 - and make it as easy and stress-free as
00:25 - possible for you to dive into this world
00:27 - I myself learned quite a bit about
00:29 - machine learning and AI back when I was
00:31 - in university this was about three years
00:32 - ago I actually have a ton of videos on
00:34 - this channel related to machine learning
00:36 - and artificial intelligence and you can
00:38 - check those out for the link in the
00:39 - description I'll pop some of them up on
00:41 - the screen so I have a really good sense
00:43 - of what it takes to dive into this field
00:44 - what kind of algorithms you should be
00:46 - learning the level of math you need to
00:48 - know what programming language you
00:49 - should learn libraries and the next more
00:52 - advanced steps that you can take if you
00:53 - really are getting serious about that so
00:55 - with that said let's dive in and let me
00:57 - share with you how to learn machine
00:58 - learning and artificial intelligence in
01:00 - 2023 so let's begin here by walking
01:03 - through the steps that's involved in
01:05 - training a machine learning model or
01:06 - really developing some kind of
01:07 - artificial intelligence you're going to
01:09 - realize very quickly here that very
01:11 - little of what you're going to do as a
01:13 - machine learning engineer or as someone
01:15 - who's interested in artificial
01:16 - intelligence is actually building
01:18 - machine learning models or artificial
01:19 - intelligence a lot of this has to do
01:21 - with data pre-processing and also things
01:23 - like deploying testing and validating
01:26 - your model so keep that in mind this is
01:28 - not as glorious and as glamorous as a
01:30 - field as you might make it out to be and
01:31 - there's a lot of very frustrating time
01:33 - consuming and difficult work that goes
01:36 - into actually being successful in
01:37 - training machine learning models and
01:39 - creating artificial intelligence anyways
01:41 - let me walk you through the steps so
01:43 - step one in any machine learning
01:44 - application or project is to define the
01:47 - problem what is the problem what are you
01:49 - trying to solve what are your goals and
01:50 - objectives and how is machine learning
01:52 - going to help you do that now step two
01:54 - is to pick the data that you're going to
01:56 - be using for your model so data
01:57 - collection where are you getting this
01:59 - data from how are you storing it and how
02:01 - are you going to decide what data you
02:03 - actually need the next step is going to
02:05 - be data cleaning oftentimes when you
02:07 - collect data especially if you're
02:09 - getting it from the internet some kind
02:10 - of Open Source you're going to need to
02:12 - clean this data and get rid of a bunch
02:13 - of information that's unnecessary too
02:15 - much data can confuse a machine learning
02:17 - model too little obviously could be not
02:19 - enough to train it and you have to be
02:20 - careful how you're cleaning this data
02:22 - and putting it in a format such that
02:24 - it's usable for your model the next step
02:26 - is going to be data selection so now you
02:28 - should have this massive amount of data
02:30 - depending on the problem obviously
02:31 - they're going to be training a model on
02:33 - now you need to actually select the
02:35 - specific pieces of data that you want to
02:36 - use to train the model not all of your
02:39 - data is going to be relevant maybe
02:40 - there's some filters you need to apply
02:41 - there's a lot of stuff that could go on
02:43 - in this step next is going to be your
02:45 - model architecture or selecting a model
02:48 - oftentimes you don't need to reinvent
02:50 - the wheel you don't need to create your
02:51 - own custom model you simply need to pick
02:54 - an existing one and then train it using
02:55 - your data so once you pick your model
02:57 - now you're going to train the model so
02:59 - you're going to feed all of your cleaned
03:01 - and processed data into that model and
03:03 - then you're going to test and evaluate
03:05 - your model and make sure that it's
03:07 - actually working as you expect once you
03:09 - do that you're going to repeat this step
03:10 - countless times until you get a model
03:12 - that has an accuracy that you are happy
03:14 - with and then if you're going in a
03:16 - production environment you are going to
03:17 - deploy this model so the reason I wanted
03:19 - to share these steps with you is just so
03:21 - you have a better picture of what's
03:23 - actually involved and what you're going
03:24 - to be doing if you get into this field
03:26 - most of your work is not going to be
03:28 - training a model coming up with a model
03:30 - architecture and doing all of that fun
03:32 - stuff you might see in YouTube videos or
03:34 - hear about In Articles a lot of it is
03:36 - going to have to do with data collecting
03:37 - data processing data and then testing
03:39 - and evaluating your model and continuing
03:42 - to repeat that process until you hit a
03:44 - point that you are satisfied with so
03:46 - after listening to those steps some of
03:47 - you might be a little bit concerned that
03:49 - your computer may not be powerful enough
03:51 - to actually execute those steps and
03:53 - train kind of more advanced deep
03:54 - learning models now if that's the case
03:57 - you don't have to worry because I'm
03:58 - actually giving away an RTX 4080 this is

05:12 - it's virtual go and check out their
05:14 - itinerary a ton of really cool stuff
05:17 - going on alright so now I'm going to get
05:18 - a bit more serious and structured and
05:20 - share with you kind of step by step what
05:21 - you need to do if you want to get into
05:23 - machine learning and AI so step one is
05:25 - going to be to learn some kind of
05:27 - programming language that you can do
05:28 - machine learning and AI in now the
05:30 - language I typically recommend here is
05:32 - python obviously python is a very
05:34 - well-rounded language you can use it for
05:36 - a bunch of stuff not just machine
05:37 - learning and Ai and it's worth learning
05:39 - even if you're not getting into this
05:40 - field but it's also the top choice for
05:42 - performing machine learning and
05:44 - artificial intelligence there's all
05:45 - kinds of libraries that use Python that
05:47 - make it really easy to deploy or not
05:49 - deploy but to create deep learning
05:51 - models or machine learning models and
05:53 - it's what I would recommend you learn
05:55 - first you do not need to be a Python
05:57 - Master but I would say you need to be
05:58 - competent in the language you need to
06:00 - understand things like for Loops classes
06:03 - objects and gets you kind of an
06:04 - intermediate programming level if you
06:06 - wanted to do that you could check out my
06:07 - course
06:08 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
06:10 - the description Additionally you may
06:12 - learn something like rust this is not a
06:14 - language I know or that I've looked at
06:15 - so I'm not going to recommend that and
06:17 - there's some other more specific machine
06:19 - learning languages you can look at kind
06:21 - of related to data science but again I'm
06:23 - not going to recommend those I'm going
06:24 - to recommend python to pretty much
06:26 - everyone here so step one Learn Python
06:29 - get decent at it you don't need to be an
06:31 - expert so moving on the next thing on my
06:33 - roadmap here is going to be to learn
06:34 - some math or to have some kind of
06:36 - foundational math background now I
06:39 - typically recommend that people that are
06:40 - diving into machine learning and Ai and
06:42 - actually want to understand what's going
06:43 - on like they want to look at the math
06:45 - they want to see what's behind just this
06:46 - basic algorithm they want to have some
06:48 - intuition on what's going on and what's
06:50 - happening should have a understanding of
06:53 - linear algebra basic calculus like
06:55 - something you'd take in grade 12 or
06:57 - first year university and then probably
06:59 - understand things like matrices vectors
07:01 - multi-dimensional math and just be
07:03 - generally speaking okay at reading like
07:05 - mathematical notation and comfortable
07:08 - kind of digging into it a little bit I'm
07:10 - not telling you you have to be a math
07:11 - whiz I am not a math genius myself but I
07:14 - did go through two years of math courses
07:16 - in University these were the computer
07:17 - science math classes and that helped me
07:20 - tremendously when I was learning machine
07:21 - learn so if you don't know the math it's
07:24 - fine you can still continue here but I
07:25 - will warn you it's going to be much more
07:27 - difficult to really grasp what's going
07:29 - on and I'd highly recommend you don't
07:31 - skip this if you have access to these
07:33 - kind of math courses alright so the next
07:35 - thing I'm going to recommend here is
07:36 - that you get familiar with some of the
07:38 - popular modules and libraries related to
07:41 - machine learning in Python I'm going to
07:43 - list them out you don't necessarily need
07:44 - to learn all of them but you should know
07:46 - what each of them is the goal of each
07:48 - library and if you're learning something
07:50 - like numpy which is the first library
07:52 - that I'm going to recommend I'd suggest
07:53 - that you spend a bit of time to
07:55 - understand some of the core functions
07:57 - and methods in that module because
07:59 - they're used quite a bit in different
08:00 - machine learning tutorials and not
08:02 - necessarily explained or kind of
08:05 - detailed as much as they should be so
08:06 - anyways the first module I'm going to
08:08 - rec command is numpy if you learn only
08:10 - one module this is the one that I would
08:11 - learn then you can look at something
08:13 - like scikit learn tensorflow Pi torch
08:16 - and then pandas pandas is more of a data
08:19 - science Library used to kind of import
08:21 - data manipulate data and oftentimes
08:23 - you're going to see this used in
08:24 - different machine learning tutorials
08:26 - again you don't have to learn all of
08:27 - these different libraries but you should
08:28 - be familiar with what they are maybe the
08:31 - difference between something like Pi
08:32 - torch and tensorflow and when you may
08:34 - want to use kind of each Library some
08:37 - tutorials will just tell you use a
08:39 - specific Library if I were you I'd want
08:41 - to have a bit more information on what
08:42 - that is and why you're using it before
08:44 - you dive right into that alright so
08:46 - finally my next step is to actually
08:47 - learn some machine learning algorithms I
08:50 - told you at the beginning of the video
08:51 - machine learning is not as glamorous as
08:53 - it seems there's a lot of other stuff
08:55 - you need to learn and understand to be
08:56 - good at it and that's why only at this
08:58 - point I'm actually telling you okay get
09:00 - into some machine learning algorithms
09:01 - and learn those now what I always
09:03 - suggest is that you learn these kind of
09:05 - foundational it's very straightforward
09:07 - and basic machine learning algorithms
09:09 - before you dive into stuff like deep
09:11 - learning neural networks convolutional
09:13 - neural networks Q learning reinforcement
09:15 - learning all of that stuff that you guys
09:17 - probably get really excited about so I'm
09:19 - going to share with you a few different
09:20 - algorithms that I would learn and I
09:22 - would really focus on learning the math
09:24 - Behind These because it's not overly
09:26 - complicated relative to some of the
09:28 - other stuff in the ML and AI world and
09:30 - if you can understand these core
09:31 - algorithms you can already do quite a
09:33 - bit of very interesting stuff that's not
09:36 - overly complicated so this will help you
09:37 - build a bit of confidence really
09:39 - understand what it means to perform
09:41 - machine learning and a lot of your more
09:43 - complicated machine learning stuff will
09:45 - kind of be based off some of the math
09:46 - and foundational information and Theory
09:49 - you get from these algorithms so let me
09:51 - go through the algorithms the first one
09:52 - is linear regression then you have
09:54 - logistic regression KNN this is a form
09:57 - of clustering so this is K nearest
09:59 - neighbors then I have support Vector
10:02 - machines then decision trees and naive
10:05 - Bayes these are very very popular
10:08 - algorithms you can find all kinds of
10:09 - videos articles tutorials whatever you
10:12 - want on these and in fact I have an
10:14 - entire series on my channel that goes
10:16 - through most of these different
10:17 - algorithms I also have a massive video
10:19 - on the free code Camp channel it's about
10:21 - seven hours long that walks you through
10:24 - a full overview and introduction of
10:26 - machine learning using tensorflow so
10:28 - I'll link that in the description as
10:29 - well anyways I would go through these
10:31 - different algorithms understand the math
10:33 - behind them practice applying them using
10:35 - some sample data sets again there's a
10:37 - million resources on the internet for
10:39 - each of them and only after you feel
10:41 - comfortable with these algorithms would
10:42 - I move on to the next step alright so at
10:45 - this point in time you'll have a really
10:47 - solid understanding of machine learning
10:49 - a really good foundation some good
10:51 - fundamentals you know python you know
10:53 - some basic libraries you know some math
10:55 - you've learned these core algorithms and
10:57 - now it's time to move on to some more
10:59 - advanced complicated and interesting
11:00 - machine learning topics I'm going to
11:03 - share with you a few different ideas
11:04 - here and kind of avenues you could go
11:06 - down but at this point it's up to you
11:07 - you need to do your own research and you
11:09 - need to figure out what you actually
11:11 - want to do what interests you and what
11:13 - you want to learn so when it comes to
11:15 - machine learning algorithms you have
11:16 - four classifications of algorithms the
11:18 - first is supervised then you have
11:20 - unsupervised semi-supervised and
11:23 - reinforcement learning these are the
11:24 - four different classifications within
11:26 - each classification as multiple
11:28 - different algorithms and methods of
11:30 - machine learning and AI to give you a
11:32 - prime example if we talk about
11:33 - supervised machine learning we're
11:35 - looking at something like classifiers
11:37 - something like neural networks where we
11:39 - have labeled data that means we have say
11:41 - an image of a cat and we have it labeled
11:43 - as cat we have an image of a dog it's
11:45 - labeled as dog and we use those labels
11:48 - to train our machine learning model and
11:50 - get it to a point where it's accurate
11:51 - enough to say predict if an image is a
11:53 - cat or a duck okay so neural networks
11:55 - would be under supervised machine
11:57 - learning something you could definitely
11:59 - learn if you were interested in that
12:00 - there's all different kinds of neural
12:02 - networks as well you know many different
12:04 - kinds so you guys can have a look at
12:06 - those and see the different names for
12:07 - them next we have unsupervised learning
12:10 - unsupervised learning is when you have
12:12 - data but you don't necessarily have a
12:14 - classification or a label for it so an
12:17 - example of unsupervised learning would
12:18 - be something like K means clustering
12:20 - this is a clustering algorithm that is
12:22 - essentially going to group different
12:24 - data points or different pieces of data
12:26 - based on similar properties so you may
12:28 - be trying to look in a data set for
12:30 - something you don't quite know yet and
12:32 - figure out different clusters or groups
12:34 - of maybe people or information or cells
12:36 - or whatever it is that you're clustering
12:38 - all right next we have a semi-supervised
12:41 - learning now I'm not an expert in this
12:42 - so I'm not going to explain it too much
12:44 - essentially this is a situation in which
12:46 - you have a little bit of labeled data
12:48 - but not enough to train the entire model
12:51 - on so you train the model on the limited
12:53 - data that is labeled and then you kind
12:55 - of perform a complicated process where
12:58 - you use non-labeled data to continue to
13:00 - improve the accuracy of the model so
13:02 - that's why it's semi-supervised you have
13:04 - some labeled data you have some
13:05 - non-label data you're kind of mixing and
13:07 - matching and trying to you get an
13:09 - accurate model lastly we have
13:11 - reinforcement learning this is the
13:13 - coolest one in my opinion an example of
13:15 - reinforcement learning would be training
13:17 - an AI how to play a game essentially
13:19 - what you're doing is reinforcing certain
13:21 - actions and maybe I guess
13:23 - non-reinforcing I don't know what the
13:24 - opposite of that would be other actions
13:27 - where you're telling the model you did
13:28 - this that's good keep doing that you did
13:30 - this that's bad stop doing that so
13:32 - you're reinforcing specific behavior
13:33 - attempting to reach some kind of goal I
13:36 - actually did a reinforcement learning
13:38 - video where I used an evolutionary
13:39 - algorithm to train an AI how to play
13:41 - Flappy Bird again entire tutorial on
13:44 - this channel I will leave that in the
13:45 - description alright so that said I think
13:47 - I'm gonna wrap up the video here as a

Cleaned transcript:

foreign tools like chat GPT exist and all of a sudden a lot of you want to dive into machine learning and artificial intelligence now I'm not here to validate that decision or to tell you that's the best possible path to go down but I am here to provide you a road map and make it as easy and stressfree as possible for you to dive into this world I myself learned quite a bit about machine learning and AI back when I was in university this was about three years ago I actually have a ton of videos on this channel related to machine learning and artificial intelligence and you can check those out for the link in the description I'll pop some of them up on the screen so I have a really good sense of what it takes to dive into this field what kind of algorithms you should be learning the level of math you need to know what programming language you should learn libraries and the next more advanced steps that you can take if you really are getting serious about that so with that said let's dive in and let me share with you how to learn machine learning and artificial intelligence in 2023 so let's begin here by walking through the steps that's involved in training a machine learning model or really developing some kind of artificial intelligence you're going to realize very quickly here that very little of what you're going to do as a machine learning engineer or as someone who's interested in artificial intelligence is actually building machine learning models or artificial intelligence a lot of this has to do with data preprocessing and also things like deploying testing and validating your model so keep that in mind this is not as glorious and as glamorous as a field as you might make it out to be and there's a lot of very frustrating time consuming and difficult work that goes into actually being successful in training machine learning models and creating artificial intelligence anyways let me walk you through the steps so step one in any machine learning application or project is to define the problem what is the problem what are you trying to solve what are your goals and objectives and how is machine learning going to help you do that now step two is to pick the data that you're going to be using for your model so data collection where are you getting this data from how are you storing it and how are you going to decide what data you actually need the next step is going to be data cleaning oftentimes when you collect data especially if you're getting it from the internet some kind of Open Source you're going to need to clean this data and get rid of a bunch of information that's unnecessary too much data can confuse a machine learning model too little obviously could be not enough to train it and you have to be careful how you're cleaning this data and putting it in a format such that it's usable for your model the next step is going to be data selection so now you should have this massive amount of data depending on the problem obviously they're going to be training a model on now you need to actually select the specific pieces of data that you want to use to train the model not all of your data is going to be relevant maybe there's some filters you need to apply there's a lot of stuff that could go on in this step next is going to be your model architecture or selecting a model oftentimes you don't need to reinvent the wheel you don't need to create your own custom model you simply need to pick an existing one and then train it using your data so once you pick your model now you're going to train the model so you're going to feed all of your cleaned and processed data into that model and then you're going to test and evaluate your model and make sure that it's actually working as you expect once you do that you're going to repeat this step countless times until you get a model that has an accuracy that you are happy with and then if you're going in a production environment you are going to deploy this model so the reason I wanted to share these steps with you is just so you have a better picture of what's actually involved and what you're going to be doing if you get into this field most of your work is not going to be training a model coming up with a model architecture and doing all of that fun stuff you might see in YouTube videos or hear about In Articles a lot of it is going to have to do with data collecting data processing data and then testing and evaluating your model and continuing to repeat that process until you hit a point that you are satisfied with so after listening to those steps some of you might be a little bit concerned that your computer may not be powerful enough to actually execute those steps and train kind of more advanced deep learning models

with you kind of step by step what you need to do if you want to get into machine learning and AI so step one is going to be to learn some kind of programming language that you can do machine learning and AI in now the language I typically recommend here is python obviously python is a very wellrounded language you can use it for a bunch of stuff not just machine learning and Ai and it's worth learning even if you're not getting into this field but it's also the top choice for performing machine learning and artificial intelligence there's all kinds of libraries that use Python that make it really easy to deploy or not deploy but to create deep learning models or machine learning models and it's what I would recommend you learn first you do not need to be a Python Master but I would say you need to be competent in the language you need to understand things like for Loops classes objects and gets you kind of an intermediate programming level if you wanted to do that you could check out my course programmingexpert.io from the link in the description Additionally you may learn something like rust this is not a language I know or that I've looked at so I'm not going to recommend that and there's some other more specific machine learning languages you can look at kind of related to data science but again I'm not going to recommend those I'm going to recommend python to pretty much everyone here so step one Learn Python get decent at it you don't need to be an expert so moving on the next thing on my roadmap here is going to be to learn some math or to have some kind of foundational math background now I typically recommend that people that are diving into machine learning and Ai and actually want to understand what's going on like they want to look at the math they want to see what's behind just this basic algorithm they want to have some intuition on what's going on and what's happening should have a understanding of linear algebra basic calculus like something you'd take in grade 12 or first year university and then probably understand things like matrices vectors multidimensional math and just be generally speaking okay at reading like mathematical notation and comfortable kind of digging into it a little bit I'm not telling you you have to be a math whiz I am not a math genius myself but I did go through two years of math courses in University these were the computer science math classes and that helped me tremendously when I was learning machine learn so if you don't know the math it's fine you can still continue here but I will warn you it's going to be much more difficult to really grasp what's going on and I'd highly recommend you don't skip this if you have access to these kind of math courses alright so the next thing I'm going to recommend here is that you get familiar with some of the popular modules and libraries related to machine learning in Python I'm going to list them out you don't necessarily need to learn all of them but you should know what each of them is the goal of each library and if you're learning something like numpy which is the first library that I'm going to recommend I'd suggest that you spend a bit of time to understand some of the core functions and methods in that module because they're used quite a bit in different machine learning tutorials and not necessarily explained or kind of detailed as much as they should be so anyways the first module I'm going to rec command is numpy if you learn only one module this is the one that I would learn then you can look at something like scikit learn tensorflow Pi torch and then pandas pandas is more of a data science Library used to kind of import data manipulate data and oftentimes you're going to see this used in different machine learning tutorials again you don't have to learn all of these different libraries but you should be familiar with what they are maybe the difference between something like Pi torch and tensorflow and when you may want to use kind of each Library some tutorials will just tell you use a specific Library if I were you I'd want to have a bit more information on what that is and why you're using it before you dive right into that alright so finally my next step is to actually learn some machine learning algorithms I told you at the beginning of the video machine learning is not as glamorous as it seems there's a lot of other stuff you need to learn and understand to be good at it and that's why only at this point I'm actually telling you okay get into some machine learning algorithms and learn those now what I always suggest is that you learn these kind of foundational it's very straightforward and basic machine learning algorithms before you dive into stuff like deep learning neural networks convolutional neural networks Q learning reinforcement learning all of that stuff that you guys probably get really excited about so I'm going to share with you a few different algorithms that I would learn and I would really focus on learning the math Behind These because it's not overly complicated relative to some of the other stuff in the ML and AI world and if you can understand these core algorithms you can already do quite a bit of very interesting stuff that's not overly complicated so this will help you build a bit of confidence really understand what it means to perform machine learning and a lot of your more complicated machine learning stuff will kind of be based off some of the math and foundational information and Theory you get from these algorithms so let me go through the algorithms the first one is linear regression then you have logistic regression KNN this is a form of clustering so this is K nearest neighbors then I have support Vector machines then decision trees and naive Bayes these are very very popular algorithms you can find all kinds of videos articles tutorials whatever you want on these and in fact I have an entire series on my channel that goes through most of these different algorithms I also have a massive video on the free code Camp channel it's about seven hours long that walks you through a full overview and introduction of machine learning using tensorflow so I'll link that in the description as well anyways I would go through these different algorithms understand the math behind them practice applying them using some sample data sets again there's a million resources on the internet for each of them and only after you feel comfortable with these algorithms would I move on to the next step alright so at this point in time you'll have a really solid understanding of machine learning a really good foundation some good fundamentals you know python you know some basic libraries you know some math you've learned these core algorithms and now it's time to move on to some more advanced complicated and interesting machine learning topics I'm going to share with you a few different ideas here and kind of avenues you could go down but at this point it's up to you you need to do your own research and you need to figure out what you actually want to do what interests you and what you want to learn so when it comes to machine learning algorithms you have four classifications of algorithms the first is supervised then you have unsupervised semisupervised and reinforcement learning these are the four different classifications within each classification as multiple different algorithms and methods of machine learning and AI to give you a prime example if we talk about supervised machine learning we're looking at something like classifiers something like neural networks where we have labeled data that means we have say an image of a cat and we have it labeled as cat we have an image of a dog it's labeled as dog and we use those labels to train our machine learning model and get it to a point where it's accurate enough to say predict if an image is a cat or a duck okay so neural networks would be under supervised machine learning something you could definitely learn if you were interested in that there's all different kinds of neural networks as well you know many different kinds so you guys can have a look at those and see the different names for them next we have unsupervised learning unsupervised learning is when you have data but you don't necessarily have a classification or a label for it so an example of unsupervised learning would be something like K means clustering this is a clustering algorithm that is essentially going to group different data points or different pieces of data based on similar properties so you may be trying to look in a data set for something you don't quite know yet and figure out different clusters or groups of maybe people or information or cells or whatever it is that you're clustering all right next we have a semisupervised learning now I'm not an expert in this so I'm not going to explain it too much essentially this is a situation in which you have a little bit of labeled data but not enough to train the entire model on so you train the model on the limited data that is labeled and then you kind of perform a complicated process where you use nonlabeled data to continue to improve the accuracy of the model so that's why it's semisupervised you have some labeled data you have some nonlabel data you're kind of mixing and matching and trying to you get an accurate model lastly we have reinforcement learning this is the coolest one in my opinion an example of reinforcement learning would be training an AI how to play a game essentially what you're doing is reinforcing certain actions and maybe I guess nonreinforcing I don't know what the opposite of that would be other actions where you're telling the model you did this that's good keep doing that you did this that's bad stop doing that so you're reinforcing specific behavior attempting to reach some kind of goal I actually did a reinforcement learning video where I used an evolutionary algorithm to train an AI how to play Flappy Bird again entire tutorial on this channel I will leave that in the description alright so that said I think I'm gonna wrap up the video here as a reminder I am giving away an RTX 4080 courtesy of Nvidia attend GTC where you can learn a lot more about AI machine learning and just technology in general and then fill out that
