00:00 - I traveled 20 hours from Dubai to Las
00:02 - Vegas just to film this one video so why
00:06 - Las Vegas well that's because I invited
00:08 - three software engineer friends of mine
00:10 - to help me answer this one question what
00:12 - projects should you put on your resume
00:14 - so let's meet our guests yo what up Tim
00:18 - yo what's going
00:23 - on combined these guys have got 20 years
00:25 - of software development experience and
00:27 - they just so happen to be my partners in
00:29 - a brand new completely free school
00:31 - Community which you can join from the
00:33 - link in the description anyways let's
00:35 - hear what they have to say so if I had
00:37 - to build a project for my resume I would
00:38 - probably build some sort of gym
00:40 - application for me I really like lifting
00:41 - lights and I feel like if you build some
00:43 - kind of weightlifting application that
00:45 - would allow you to really solve a
00:46 - problem that you actually have and face
00:48 - hopefully every single day when you're
00:49 - in the gym and I think by you solving a
00:51 - problem that you actually have and face
00:53 - it's a problem that you know intricately
00:55 - and so you're going to actually design
00:57 - things and build stuff that's helpful
00:58 - for you and that's very for how you do
01:00 - stuff in real software where you're
01:02 - building things that are useful for
01:03 - users so when you actually build
01:05 - something that you're passionate about
01:07 - you also really know that thing very
01:08 - well and so for example if I had to
01:10 - answer questions about that application
01:12 - that I built recruiters are going to
01:13 - know that I'm passionate and that I
01:15 - actually know all the details because I
01:17 - care about the problem so for me I think
01:19 - another thing too is maintaining
01:20 - motivation and if I'm building something
01:22 - that solves a problem that I have I'm
01:24 - going to be more willing to actually
01:25 - spend the time to invest and do that
01:28 - thing because I'm interested in that
01:30 - actual application that I'm
01:32 - building yeah so I think it kind of
01:34 - depends if you want to do things that
01:35 - are all in one language you could
01:36 - definitely use something like PHP or
01:38 - Java or really whatever it is that
01:40 - you're comfortable with my advice is
01:42 - always to take something that you know
01:43 - well and you feel comfortable with and
01:45 - start building that thing it's always
01:46 - hard when you have to throw more tasks
01:48 - on top of something like if you don't
01:50 - know react and now you want to build
01:51 - something in react that's fine but now
01:53 - you have another hurdle or another thing
01:54 - to get over so what I would really
01:56 - recommend doing is figuring out what you
01:57 - want to build it in and then start
01:59 - building it in that thing and I think a
02:01 - good way to do that too is just break up
02:02 - different tasks engineering you
02:04 - constantly do that you constantly figure
02:05 - out a big thing and break it down into
02:07 - smaller chunks that you can really
02:09 - deliver in smaller bite-sized pieces so
02:11 - I would probably first think about the
02:13 - front end and then I would also think
02:14 - about the back end and like anything
02:16 - else I think about how they connect and
02:17 - the data that the front end needs and
02:19 - the data that the back end has to
02:20 - provide to the front end to actually
02:22 - have the application work as expected so
02:24 - I would probably use something like
02:25 - react because I know react and I have
02:27 - experience with react and i' probably
02:29 - use a backend programming language like
02:30 - Java because that's sort of my expertise
02:32 - and what I've done a lot of work in so
02:34 - I'd probably build something in the
02:35 - front end first and then sort of see how
02:38 - I want it to to work or look from a user
02:40 - experience and I'd figure out the data
02:42 - that I have to provide on the back end
02:43 - for that to actually function by the way
02:45 - if you want an entire guide going
02:47 - through the best projects to add on your
02:48 - resume then make sure you check out our
02:50 - school community in there we've got live
02:52 - calls over 13,000 members and I've just
02:55 - written a post going over a ton of extra
02:57 - projects that would look fantastic on
02:58 - your resume so an idea that I've had for
03:01 - a while around a really cool project
03:03 - idea that you could build that could
03:04 - really make you stand out and this might
03:06 - sound crazy and it would certainly take
03:08 - a lot of effort would be around building
03:11 - a highlevel programming language
03:13 - developing a compiler for that
03:14 - programming language in a language like
03:17 - C and then building a video game with
03:19 - that highlevel programming language like
03:21 - Tetris or Pac-Man and don't get me wrong
03:23 - this would certainly take a lot of
03:25 - effort but it would undoubtedly showcase
03:28 - the fact that you are a really skilled
03:30 - developer that you have a really strong
03:33 - understanding of computer science and
03:34 - software engineering principles and how
03:36 - programming languages work and for
03:38 - anyone interested in building this type
03:40 - of project a great place to start would
03:42 - be with a book titled the elements of a
03:44 - Computing system that goes through
03:46 - building a computer from the ground up
03:48 - starting with basic logic gates all the
03:50 - way to creating a highlevel programming
03:52 - language for that computer that's
03:54 - capable of running Tetris yeah so a
03:57 - great project that you can put on your
03:58 - resume is you want to build a software
04:01 - project usually with about something
04:02 - that you're interested in because that's
04:04 - going to give you more motivation to
04:06 - work on it because it's obviously
04:07 - something you're interested in something
04:09 - I'm interested in is education when I
04:11 - was in college I was a computer science
04:13 - tutor and then I started a YouTube
04:15 - channel where I teach and I do hundreds
04:16 - of videos teaching Le code problems so I
04:19 - built an educational platform similar to
04:22 - how Omega is structured where you
04:23 - connect with a random person over video
04:25 - chat and talk to them and I thought this
04:27 - would be a cool style of thing for
04:29 - education where you could connect to
04:30 - random people over specific categories
04:33 - of Education or specific topics and uh
04:35 - discuss those things maybe you could
04:37 - find a mentor or somebody that knows
04:39 - more than you and you can learn from
04:41 - that person so I was kind of inspired by
04:42 - the platform pramp where you could
04:43 - connect with random people and do mock
04:45 - interviews to prepare coding interviews
04:48 - so I thought this could transfer into
04:49 - other things like different categories
04:50 - like uh geography politics business all
04:54 - of these things you can connect and talk
04:56 - to people so I actually built this
04:58 - during a hackathon and then working on
05:00 - it it was a full stack JavaScript
05:02 - application where we use react on the
05:03 - front end and then node.js on the back
05:05 - end and we really managed the whole
05:08 - thing through node.js websockets where
05:10 - the people would connect over websocket
05:12 - video chat and uh we did have like login
05:15 - and cookies and stuff like that and we
05:17 - wanted to make it so that people had to
05:18 - sign up with educational emails so that
05:21 - we could prevent things like Bots spams
05:23 - people that got on to troll and things
05:24 - like that we just wanted people to be
05:26 - serious on the platform and yeah that
05:28 - was the project we wanted the hack on
05:30 - and I think this stands out specifically
05:31 - because it's an interesting idea it's a
05:34 - little bit more Innovative than just
05:36 - your average generic project that people
05:38 - build and put on their resume so it kind
05:40 - of shows that I can think on my own and
05:43 - think of creative ideas well there you
05:45 - have it three incredible projects from
05:47 - some experienced software Engineers I
05:49 - hope you guys found this useful and I
05:51 - look forward to seeing you in the next
05:53 - [Music]
05:58 - one

I traveled 20 hours from Dubai to Las Vegas just to film this one video so why Las Vegas well that's because I invited three software engineer friends of mine to help me answer this one question what
