With timestamps:

00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to the third
00:11 - tech with tim code jam project showcase
00:14 - so in this video i've got five awesome
00:16 - programming projects to show you
00:18 - these are projects that were worked on
00:20 - by the community so subscribers of this
00:22 - channel and people that are part of my
00:23 - discord server
00:25 - and i'm just going to give you some
00:26 - context here about what this competition
00:28 - is and kind of how this works
00:29 - so you can join it if you would like to
00:31 - but if you don't care about that you
00:32 - just want to see the projects there will
00:34 - be some timestamps in the description so
00:35 - go ahead and fast forward to that
00:38 - so every two months i run a coding
00:40 - competition in my discord server this
00:42 - discord server has about 22 000 members
00:44 - we do a ton of other stuff in there as
00:46 - well so we have help channels
00:48 - we have weekly coding challenges and we
00:50 - just do all kinds of other great
00:51 - community things and in the future we're
00:53 - thinking about running stuff like
00:54 - minecraft servers
00:55 - and just other you know great ways to
00:57 - kind of bring the community together
00:58 - around programming and whatever
01:00 - else it is that we're doing so every two
01:02 - months i run this coding competition
01:04 - and pretty much anyone can sign up to
01:05 - participate in this we pick a theme
01:08 - so the coding competition is kind of
01:09 - called a timithon this is
01:11 - you know kind of emulating a hackathon
01:12 - but since it's for techwithsam we're
01:14 - calling it a timithon
01:15 - and this month's or this two months i
01:17 - guess theme was a virtual assistant so
01:20 - this coding competition started january
01:22 - 1st
01:22 - of 2021 participants had a week to find
01:26 - a team and sign up
01:27 - and then they had a month to actually
01:29 - work on a project submit their projects
01:31 - and then there was i believe about a
01:33 - week of community voting so
01:35 - if i go here to the submissions you can
01:37 - see we have all of the teams that
01:39 - actually submitted a project
01:41 - so a ton of people are participating in
01:42 - this which is awesome and then the
01:44 - community goes and votes on their
01:46 - favorite projects and the top
01:47 - five projects projects that receive the
01:50 - most amount of votes
01:51 - get reviewed in a video so like this and
01:53 - then i will pick
01:54 - the top three winning teams and then
01:56 - send them their cash
01:58 - prizes so that's kind of the idea behind
02:00 - this coding competition
02:01 - if you want to participate make sure you
02:03 - join the discord server all of this
02:04 - stuff is ran through discord there'll be
02:06 - a link in the description
02:07 - you can also come to this website right
02:09 - here to check out all of the other
02:10 - projects that i don't show
02:12 - uh you will have to sign in with discord
02:14 - and the link for this website is twt
02:17 - codejam.net again this will be linked in
02:19 - the description
02:20 - you can go to timothon and you can go to
02:22 - view submissions and you can see all the
02:24 - submissions
02:25 - assuming that we have not yet closed
02:26 - this when the video goes live so anyways
02:28 - that is kind of the idea here
02:30 - i've got five projects to show you so
02:32 - let me exit out of this and then i'll go
02:33 - through the projects and then we'll talk
02:34 - about the winners afterwards
02:36 - all right so i've got the first project
02:38 - up in front of me you know i just want
02:39 - to give you some information here before
02:41 - i go through all of this
02:42 - first of all i want to talk to you about
02:43 - how i'm kind of grading these projects
02:45 - or picking who wins
02:46 - now first of all i will say there's a
02:47 - lot of bias in how i'm picking the
02:49 - winner a lot of you guys are kind of
02:50 - upset sometimes and who i decide to pick
02:53 - i'll be brutally honest with you the
02:54 - project that i like the best and kind of
02:56 - ticks my three pieces of criteria which
02:58 - i'll discuss in a second
02:59 - is just the one that i'm going to pick
03:01 - so those three pieces of criteria
03:03 - are how well does the project fit the
03:05 - theme so is this something that is you
03:06 - know right on par with what the theme is
03:08 - in this case it was virtual assistant so
03:10 - pretty easy to fit that theme
03:12 - my next piece of criteria that i'm
03:14 - looking at here is how
03:15 - polished is this project so is this rush
03:18 - does this not look very good does it
03:19 - feel like there's lots of bugs and this
03:21 - is kind of a last minute thing
03:22 - or is this super polished super well
03:24 - done you know everything is thought of
03:26 - and there was a lot of effort put into
03:28 - this project then lastly the thing that
03:30 - i'm looking at
03:30 - is how complicated or difficult is it to
03:33 - make what it is that you have for your
03:34 - project if this is something super
03:36 - simple
03:36 - i may not uh you know like it as much as
03:38 - something that's super complicated and
03:40 - took a lot of hard work to do
03:42 - so anyways those are the three pieces of
03:43 - criteria i'm kind of looking at when i'm
03:45 - you know viewing these projects
03:47 - and anyways let me start going through
03:48 - them so i'm going to start by showing
03:50 - you the project with
03:51 - most votes first and then i will show
03:52 - you second most third most fourth fifth
03:55 - so on uh so we have this first one here
03:57 - which is called
03:58 - nc all of these github repositories i
04:00 - will link in the description
04:02 - and it says researching and creating
04:04 - projects is tedious nc is a virtual
04:06 - assistant developed with the concept of
04:08 - automating research and organizing
04:09 - projects and assignment
04:11 - all right so this is a website really
04:13 - nice read me just small things like this
04:15 - you know make a really good first
04:16 - impression when you're looking at a
04:17 - project
04:18 - we can see this is by team coffee and
04:20 - these are the four
04:21 - contributors here awesome so let me go
04:23 - to the website we're gonna go in full
04:25 - screen mode here
04:26 - and let me start giving you my thoughts
04:28 - now full disclosure i have looked at all
04:29 - of these projects before just to make
04:30 - sure they work and
04:32 - are appropriate before i put them in the
04:33 - video not that any of them have been
04:35 - inappropriate but anyways let's go
04:37 - through this so we have
04:38 - nc the virtual assistant you need
04:41 - summarize
04:41 - narrate personalize get things done with
04:44 - nc nice so there is a video here
04:46 - i'm not going to watch this video but
04:48 - that's a nice touch let's go back to
04:49 - this page here
04:51 - there is a get started so i believe that
04:52 - will bring us and then there's just a
04:54 - nice landing page here so make your
04:55 - projects well managed
04:57 - summarize text or web articles with just
04:59 - a click
05:00 - i'm not going to read through all of
05:01 - this but generally just getting the feel
05:03 - that this looks
05:04 - really professional if you had just sent
05:06 - me this website and didn't tell me this
05:08 - was you know some hobbyist programmer
05:10 - that was in my discord server
05:11 - i would have thought this was just a
05:12 - professional website maybe a startup or
05:14 - something like that
05:15 - looks really great really clean and just
05:17 - really liking how it looks so far
05:19 - anyways let's go to get started so when
05:21 - i go to get start it's going to bring me
05:22 - to my account i've actually already
05:24 - signed in here
05:25 - but you can sign in with google and you
05:27 - can sign in with other services as well
05:29 - which i thought was a really nice touch
05:31 - because i love just that kind of one
05:32 - click sign in you can see i've created
05:34 - two projects here
05:35 - i can create another project let's name
05:38 - this project um what do i want to go
05:41 - with here let's just go with
05:43 - coding okay and let
05:46 - nc provide you with ai generated tips
05:48 - awesome story creating project failed
05:50 - try disabling ai tips feature
05:52 - okay so let's disable that and see if
05:53 - this works and boom okay so it actually
05:55 - did work now
05:56 - we can see there is a little chat bot in
05:58 - the bottom right hand corner here
06:00 - hey hey there it's me nc i found these
06:02 - cool articles
06:03 - thought you might find them useful
06:04 - science science computer science science
06:06 - fiction
06:07 - oh that's interesting so it's kind of
06:08 - like an ai recommending me stuff let's
06:10 - go here computer science this is from
06:12 - wikipedia
06:13 - nice nice that is a cool touch let's go
06:15 - back in here looks like there's some
06:17 - activities that are part of my project
06:18 - that i can say cross
06:20 - off or delete i can also add an activity
06:23 - let's just go with hello
06:25 - even has a little auto saving thing up
06:26 - here just small features like that i
06:28 - really appreciate
06:29 - like the ui is really clean it just
06:31 - seems really intuitive
06:32 - let's add some blocks so let's just go
06:34 - with coding we can add a paragraph block
06:37 - coding is great looks like i can add an
06:41 - image or some text things
06:43 - nice nice okay i can also export this
06:45 - let's see what happens when i press
06:47 - export oh wow okay so i can export this
06:50 - as a text document that's really
06:53 - interesting
06:54 - nice let's see what else we can do here
06:56 - let's chat with the bot
06:58 - hi glad to see you back dude nice that's
07:01 - awesome
07:02 - um what else should i ask this let's see
07:05 - when was coding started i know that
07:08 - doesn't really make much sense
07:09 - i did not receive a response can you try
07:11 - again what
07:12 - is my name uh hey i'm nc okay makes
07:16 - sense
07:17 - all right so let's close that looks like
07:19 - i can summarize
07:20 - text and articles summarize stuff here
07:23 - okay nc is an artificial intelligence
07:25 - based on transformers which is
07:26 - wide leaves oh that's how it works all
07:28 - right nc is a powerful text summarizer
07:30 - which gives you
07:31 - a summary of text or a web page it also
07:33 - gives you suggestions from wikipedia
07:35 - articles and important keywords okay
07:36 - that's interesting so
07:37 - let's summarize this computer science
07:39 - article right here
07:40 - so url article let's summarize that
07:43 - and let's see what we get all right so
07:45 - it looks like the summary came up
07:47 - it looks like it has some keywords here
07:49 - from the article i mean these seem to
07:50 - make sense
07:51 - uh computer science i won't read through
07:53 - all of that but it does
07:54 - look like that this makes sense in his
07:56 - properly formed sentences
07:57 - then it has some other articles to look
07:59 - at glossary of computer science
08:01 - uh does that open up a new page now it's
08:03 - loading i'll wait for that to load
08:05 - oh awesome and it brings me to this page
08:07 - right here okay so really cool
08:09 - i think that's all to look at for this
08:11 - project i might be missing something
08:13 - but it looks like i can do stuff like
08:15 - delete projects yeah i'm going to delete
08:17 - that one right here and everything just
08:18 - seems to be functioning this seems
08:20 - really polished just a lot of these
08:21 - small touches even just small things
08:23 - like the date here
08:24 - the ui the fact that there's you know
08:26 - highlights on the buttons
08:27 - this little online button it just looks
08:30 - really clean it looks really
08:31 - professional and i'm
08:32 - really impressed by this project and
08:34 - specifically the ui and kind of design
08:36 - of this
08:37 - so good job guys this is really
08:39 - impressive pat yourself on the back
08:41 - now let's move on to project number two
08:43 - all right so the next project that i
08:45 - have is called
08:46 - pro box the toolbox for programmers same
08:49 - thing here
08:50 - really nice and simple looking readme
08:52 - first thing i look at when i look at
08:54 - these projects just to read me right and
08:55 - so having a nice readme is already
08:57 - just a great addition nice little image
08:59 - here that they created
09:00 - uh shows me i guess yeah code jam
09:02 - timothon that's cool platform web
09:04 - browser repo size nice nice
09:06 - and this is a website as well so this is
09:08 - by who does it say the contributors are
09:10 - um i can't find all of the contributors
09:13 - in here
09:14 - uh does it say the team that did this uh
09:17 - maybe on the side ah here they are okay
09:18 - so we have
09:19 - these three guys i've seen snowball and
09:21 - fireplank before
09:22 - excuse me if i haven't seen you before
09:24 - but these two definitely participate in
09:26 - some other code gyms
09:27 - awesome so let's go to pro box this is
09:30 - the website right here let's make this
09:32 - full screen
09:32 - zoom in a little bit it looks like
09:34 - there's just a bunch of tools that we
09:36 - can use
09:36 - so code compiler let's try this out oh
09:39 - this is
09:40 - really cool okay this kind of reminds me
09:42 - of like the leak code interface almost
09:43 - um the way that it looks i can change my
09:46 - editor oh let's go with that this is my
09:48 - favorite uh
09:49 - font this is a python template let's say
09:53 - print hello run
09:57 - let's see who we get and hello okay
09:58 - awesome i have no idea how they did this
10:01 - by the way i'm super impressed i can
10:02 - write in c
10:02 - plus plus two um compiling nice
10:06 - ruby lua node.js wow awesome i can
10:08 - remove the cache
10:10 - damn super impressive that's just one of
10:12 - the tools they have a
10:13 - code shortener okay i'm not actually
10:15 - going to use this but i can see that it
10:17 - just shortens the code
10:18 - like this which is really interesting um
10:20 - changes all the variable names and
10:21 - everything
10:21 - wow that's impressive as well uh
10:23 - dictionary let's search something let's
10:25 - search for tim
10:27 - okay clearly there's no definition for
10:28 - tim let's go with like book
10:31 - oh wow okay nice code awesome
10:35 - let's try out the calculator 85 times 96
10:39 - okay let's go yeah mod or divide or
10:42 - percent whatever it is okay 81.6
10:44 - nice can get out of that stack overflow
10:48 - uh how to reverse a
10:51 - linked list let's see what we get here
10:53 - create a new links list reverse linked
10:55 - list python
10:56 - load more damn okay this is really cool
10:58 - i'm not gonna click on these i trust
10:59 - that these links do work
11:01 - um yeah it looks like this is a link
11:03 - okay awesome
11:04 - um voice recorder we can try this uh
11:07 - notice this might not work but another
11:08 - app is using
11:09 - the current webcam wait is this video or
11:11 - voice recorder which one do i pre oh
11:13 - video recorder sorry
11:14 - um yeah so my webcam is obviously being
11:16 - used right now so i can't test this out
11:18 - uh but i did look at that previously and
11:19 - it was actually working uh
11:21 - voice recorder this will this work if my
11:23 - mic is being used by something else
11:24 - hopefully
11:25 - uh we're doing a test recording here i
11:26 - want to see if this works
11:28 - okay let's play this
11:34 - okay so i think that is working my
11:35 - speaker's actually off but you guys
11:36 - probably should have heard it
11:38 - through obs so i'm going to trust that
11:40 - works i did test that before and it was
11:42 - working
11:42 - uh regex templates this one is actually
11:45 - really cool i really love that they have
11:46 - these because these are super useful and
11:48 - like you're always looking this kind of
11:49 - stuff
11:50 - up uh so json ipv4 visa card csv
11:53 - mastercard nice nice okay um github
11:57 - so i believe this is oh it just brings
11:58 - you the github for this project okay
12:00 - that makes sense let's go
12:01 - back here to pro box they have a
12:03 - whiteboard
12:04 - uh let's do some drawing here okay so i
12:07 - can't change the color or anything but i
12:09 - mean that makes sense
12:10 - let's reset that awesome there is an
12:13 - ascii chart this is really useful too i
12:16 - can look for all of the characters and
12:17 - see what their ascii code is
12:19 - nice they have a to-do list i watch some
12:21 - attack with tim videos i like how that's
12:23 - already ticked off
12:24 - bonus points for that uh add oops add
12:28 - this item okay let's add that
12:32 - seems to be working very nice we can
12:34 - reset that
12:35 - i love how the default is these two
12:38 - that's funny
12:39 - and yeah it looks like that is the
12:40 - entire project oh there's also a home
12:41 - page
12:42 - okay this is a really nice looking
12:43 - homepage i didn't even see this before
12:45 - try the tools you are a programmer some
12:47 - kind of nice motion
12:48 - again the design has just really been
12:50 - blowing me away from these projects that
12:52 - you guys
12:52 - have done this is really impressive
12:54 - we've got a contact page yeah same thing
12:56 - here just some nice animation and
12:57 - movement
12:58 - i can change the background color okay
13:01 - so that goes to green we can change this
13:03 - back
13:03 - to white wow really impressive so that
13:05 - is project number two
13:07 - uh kind of my same thoughts as project
13:08 - one i'm just really blown away
13:10 - by the design and what you guys have
13:12 - done on the front here just looks really
13:13 - professional and really nice
13:15 - um the tools i mean some of these are
13:17 - pretty useful i'm not gonna lie
13:18 - a lot of them are kind of just thrown in
13:20 - here i think just to add some more tools
13:22 - but definitely interesting the code
13:23 - shortener and code compiler i'm really
13:25 - interested by i don't know how you guys
13:26 - did that so that's super impressive
13:28 - uh ascii chart was a nice addition regex
13:31 - templates same thing
13:32 - awesome so now let's move on to the
13:34 - third project all right so the next
13:36 - project i have here is called kryptent
13:38 - uh is that how you pronounce that i have
13:40 - no idea if that's how you say it
13:42 - there's a really long readme here that
13:44 - goes through a ton of stuff i'm not
13:45 - going to go through this
13:46 - but pretty much this is a cryptocurrency
13:49 - like
13:49 - information site or something like that
13:51 - i haven't looked at it a ton
13:52 - i'm trying to find who this is by but i
13:54 - don't see any contributors let's go to
13:56 - the insights and see if we can find this
13:58 - uh contributors looks like we have one
14:00 - guys tech guy
14:01 - 940 31 000 lines of code
14:04 - wow this looks like a pretty awesome
14:07 - project damn you can kind of see the
14:08 - contributing graph
14:09 - okay sweet so let's go to cry uh krypton
14:12 - tier i'm probably going to keep
14:13 - pronouncing it wrong
14:14 - i'm going to say get candlestick graph
14:15 - for any cryptocurrency
14:17 - oh yeah it just says the same thing get
14:18 - started know more about candlesticks
14:21 - go about let's see this wow okay this is
14:25 - a really professional looking website
14:26 - damn get in touch
14:28 - facebook youtube twitter instagram um
14:31 - again
14:31 - super blown away by this it just looks
14:33 - great i'm i don't know how to make
14:35 - something that looks like this
14:36 - services ai advice let's see here um
14:40 - wow okay you can get it but i don't know
14:41 - if this is real or not if he's actually
14:43 - if he actually does this but this is
14:44 - really cool
14:44 - you can submit a prediction um for
14:47 - different
14:48 - coins nice um cryptant ai
14:51 - advice uh cryptocurrency news let's see
14:54 - what's here
14:55 - latest news wow god damn okay this is
14:58 - really cool this just looks like a
14:59 - professional website
15:01 - candlestick graph let's try this one out
15:03 - okay so let's do this was what was on
15:04 - the homepage let's try this
15:05 - uh time interval one minute let's go
15:08 - with one day
15:09 - and yeah sure let's get the graph of
15:11 - bitcoin
15:12 - and wow okay it generates a candlestick
15:14 - graph i wonder what is being used to do
15:16 - this but that's really interesting shows
15:18 - me the highs
15:19 - and the lows this is super speedy and
15:20 - snappy let's do
15:22 - litecoin one of my favorite coins let's
15:24 - see what this one is
15:25 - awesome can i change this oh i can save
15:27 - this too wow
15:28 - and let's see what else they have api
15:32 - okay so this shows you the actual api
15:34 - that i don't know if this guy designed
15:35 - or
15:36 - that just exists that he's using but
15:38 - that's really interesting it's on
15:39 - postman
15:40 - uh let's go back here to this website uh
15:43 - so the thing that i don't like here
15:44 - though is that this is opening like
15:46 - different web pages for every single
15:47 - thing that's my only critique so far i
15:49 - just i don't like when uh websites do
15:51 - that
15:51 - let's go to the contact okay it just
15:52 - brings us to the bottom of whatever this
15:54 - page was
15:55 - and i think that's all i have to go
15:56 - through for this website i do apologize
15:58 - guys if i'm missing stuff
15:59 - i'm just kind of trying to get a quick
16:01 - look at this i can't go through every
16:02 - single possible feature
16:04 - but this one is super impressive it's
16:06 - also very timely with all the
16:07 - cryptocurrency stuff going on right now
16:09 - and yeah as i'm saying with all these
16:11 - projects like if you just showed this to
16:12 - me and you didn't tell me that you know
16:14 - this was some hobbyist program working
16:15 - on this that was a part of my discord
16:17 - server
16:17 - i would genuinely just think this was
16:19 - another professional website i wouldn't
16:20 - question it
16:21 - looks great everything seems to be
16:22 - working and again awesome job on this
16:25 - project especially because it was just
16:26 - one person who did this
16:27 - so now let's move on to project four all
16:30 - right so in front of me here i've got
16:32 - project
16:32 - four this one is called violet i'll just
16:35 - read the description here
16:36 - so violet provides you with five core
16:38 - features a news feed with selectable
16:40 - categories a text editor with the added
16:42 - functionality of text to speech
16:44 - an online recipe browser quick access to
16:46 - common social media sites and a to-do
16:49 - list awesome so to access this this is a
16:51 - website let me close all of these
16:53 - uh these website links here okay let's
16:56 - go to this
16:57 - and let's scroll down so we have a to-do
16:58 - list latest news
17:00 - stay connected text-to-speech view
17:02 - recipes and more features coming soon
17:04 - let's get started here okay it's going
17:07 - to take a second to load
17:08 - all right so i have to create an account
17:10 - so let's do this let's just make this
17:12 - tech with tim let's see if it will allow
17:15 - my extremely weak
17:16 - password and it looks like it does okay
17:18 - so no little message telling me that i
17:20 - actually create an account
17:22 - first critique there on kind of the ui
17:24 - side let's log into this
17:26 - and okay wow here we are so this is the
17:28 - website let's go full screen mode
17:30 - so we can go to youtube google reddit
17:32 - instagram all of the other logos that
17:34 - i'm sure
17:34 - you guys know um blaze with the fire
17:37 - that is never extinguished oh
17:39 - interesting okay
17:40 - create a list enter time enter task
17:43 - let's just go with film this
17:47 - video okay do i need to enter a time
17:50 - um what do i have to do for this say
17:52 - like february
17:54 - 25th or something uh oh okay perfect so
17:56 - it does actually work february 25th
17:58 - film this video uh news let's see what
18:01 - news is giving me
18:03 - okay this is interesting so whatever is
18:05 - going on here just showing me a bunch of
18:07 - news
18:07 - can i change the categories oh yes i
18:08 - can't let's go to technology news i
18:10 - don't really care about the world news
18:11 - right now
18:12 - one thing that i am noticing is this
18:13 - website is quite slow i'm not going to
18:15 - dock anything for that because this just
18:16 - hosts on heroku
18:18 - um the images are also pretty stretched
18:19 - but that's fine looks like i can click
18:21 - on these if i want
18:22 - but that's cool showing me a bunch of
18:24 - different news articles
18:26 - text to speech whoa okay so i can i
18:28 - guess
18:29 - write like an entire thing here let's go
18:31 - hello
18:32 - let's change this text to be bold
18:36 - bold do i have to highlight it and press
18:38 - bold or something
18:39 - okay so i don't know maybe bold's just
18:41 - not working or maybe i'm just an idiot
18:43 - and i don't know how this works
18:44 - um let's go with italic again do i have
18:47 - to highlight this for the
18:49 - maybe these buttons just don't work i'm
18:51 - not sure if i'm doing this incorrectly
18:52 - or something but a lot of these buttons
18:53 - just don't seem to do anything
18:55 - okay the underline work just the italic
18:57 - and the bold doesn't seem to do anything
18:59 - that's fine can i align this in the
19:00 - center
19:01 - okay so that does work i have a what is
19:04 - this a ruler or something
19:06 - i can add notes awesome oh i can also
19:09 - export
19:10 - that and then there's the text speech
19:11 - thing nice recipes
19:13 - let's search for a recipe when they say
19:16 - recipe i'm not really sure what they
19:17 - mean are they talking about like food
19:18 - recipes
19:19 - uh let's just go with a recipe for pizza
19:22 - see
19:22 - how to make pizza dough okay so i guess
19:24 - it is uh food recipes so
19:26 - uh you know a little bit offset here but
19:28 - totally fine this
19:29 - oh internal server error okay
19:31 - interesting i believe that's just a
19:32 - heroku issue again i'm not gonna
19:34 - you know dock any marks or whatever
19:35 - because this is uh host on heroku
19:38 - um serves unknown cook 30 to 60 minutes
19:40 - serves two cook
19:42 - 10 to 30 minutes okay it's interesting
19:44 - that they're able to actually find this
19:46 - information i'm not sure what they're
19:47 - pulling this from
19:48 - i have my account and yeah i think
19:49 - that's pretty much all for this let's go
19:51 - to
19:52 - google this just bring me it just brings
19:53 - me to google okay interesting
19:55 - all right so i guess that is the violet
19:57 - project now my thoughts on this one
19:59 - first of all i will just say this is
20:00 - obviously not as polished as some of the
20:02 - other projects doesn't mean this is not
20:04 - still a great project just kind of hard
20:06 - to uh you know
20:07 - compete with all of those other ones i
20:08 - also don't know how many people worked
20:09 - on this
20:10 - other kind of piece of critique here
20:12 - that i will say is that these categories
20:14 - don't really make much sense to me
20:16 - in terms of how they go together they
20:18 - seem very distinct and
20:20 - different so like news text-to-speech
20:21 - recipes it's fine there's no rule that
20:23 - says they have to go together i'm just a
20:25 - little bit confused why these ones were
20:26 - picked
20:27 - i like the fact that we have the quotes
20:28 - here i like that there's lots of
20:30 - different features and that for the most
20:31 - part they're all working with the
20:32 - exception of a few buttons
20:34 - um seems like everything is just
20:36 - functioning as it should be
20:38 - and well i mean this is a cool project
20:39 - it's not really much more for me to say
20:41 - so with that said
20:42 - let's move on to project five all right
20:44 - so in front of me i've got
20:46 - project five this one is by the
20:48 - champions clan
20:49 - team i believe and this is called robert
20:52 - virtual assistant so robert your own
20:54 - virtual assistant with a beautiful text
20:56 - and speech based
20:56 - interface you can see that they have
20:59 - some nice gifs and stuff here i
21:00 - appreciate the effort put into this
21:02 - readme and kind of all the styling and
21:03 - the emojis and everything you've got
21:05 - um so apparently the way that this works
21:07 - is it's a background application
21:09 - that sits in your system tray and then
21:12 - you can activate it with uh like hotkeys
21:14 - like shift plus seven
21:16 - shift plus six now i did read this
21:17 - entire readme i read all of the readmes
21:19 - before i actually went ahead and worked
21:21 - on the project
21:22 - so i will run this code but i will
21:23 - mention just right now
21:25 - that the actual voice assistant part of
21:26 - this project at least on my computer
21:28 - is not working it works once and then
21:30 - doesn't really do
21:31 - anything after that so i will just say
21:34 - that i tried very hard to get this to
21:36 - work i appreciate the effort you guys
21:37 - put into this
21:38 - and i spent about 20 or 30 minutes
21:39 - trying to figure this out i couldn't
21:41 - figure it out
21:42 - and so i don't know what to tell you but
21:43 - i'm only going to be able to review one
21:44 - part of your project so anyways
21:46 - let me run this code and then i'll be
21:47 - right back all right so i've got
21:49 - the code running right here now the idea
21:51 - is that there's supposed to be something
21:53 - in my system tray that has kind of uh
21:56 - this logo right here i'm supposed to be
21:58 - able to press shift seven or shift six
22:00 - on my keyboard which i'm doing right now
22:01 - and it's supposed to like activate a
22:03 - virtual assistant
22:04 - now it's not doing that and i don't know
22:06 - why you can see the keyboard shortcuts
22:08 - are here i can change the the mode of
22:10 - this application
22:11 - okay that's interesting let's leave it
22:12 - at dark mode and they have
22:14 - code snippets so i believe what i can do
22:16 - here is i can save
22:18 - code snippets so i can have like a file
22:20 - i guess that's located somewhere and
22:22 - then this will just organize them all
22:23 - for me so let's try this
22:25 - uh let's find a code snippet here let's
22:27 - just snip it one of their codes well we
22:29 - can snip it main dot pi
22:31 - uh type name of your code let's just go
22:34 - with python
22:35 - okay and there you go so now i can save
22:37 - the snippet and i guess i don't know
22:39 - what happens when i press on this
22:40 - doesn't seem like anything maybe i'm
22:44 - doing this incorrectly anyways i guess
22:45 - you can save code snippets you can sort
22:47 - them
22:47 - by language or by alphabet i can search
22:50 - for snippets
22:51 - nice i have translations let's go hello
22:55 - world and let's translate
22:58 - okay bonjour le monde i don't speak
23:01 - french very well obviously
23:03 - nice looks like that's working uh task
23:05 - manager
23:06 - you can see i added this one in
23:07 - previously uh tim is great
23:09 - obviously that's going to be there i can
23:11 - edit a task let's change the name to be
23:14 - hello testing priority okay there's five
23:18 - priority levels that's nice i guess it's
23:19 - going to show me the highest priority
23:21 - for
23:21 - first in fact we can test that let's
23:23 - change this to five uh
23:26 - oops tim
23:29 - tim is great okay save uh and yes okay
23:32 - so that did actually update
23:33 - i can add another task go test and add
23:36 - that one in
23:37 - i guess i have to add a description as
23:39 - well so let's add that
23:41 - okay nice so i can tick them off true
23:43 - true okay so i guess
23:44 - they forgot to remove the debugging
23:46 - there that's fine and then what else is
23:48 - there here there is a reminder so it
23:50 - looks like i can set some types of
23:51 - alarms so i can turn that on
23:53 - uh in one hour i guess that will send an
23:56 - alarm i don't know how that alarm is
23:57 - going to work
23:58 - but i guess that will function like that
24:01 - okay nice
24:02 - and i guess that's all for this project
24:04 - now uh there's the settings okay
24:06 - so first of all nice project i i really
24:08 - do apologize that i can't get the
24:10 - text-to-speech to work i imagine that
24:12 - that's really the core part of this
24:13 - application
24:14 - again i did try to run this i even tried
24:16 - just running the file
24:18 - and it works but it doesn't give me any
24:19 - output so i'm not going to show it in
24:20 - this video
24:21 - there's no point in doing that i do
24:23 - apologize
24:24 - but that's all i have to say so
24:27 - interesting project
24:28 - obviously not super polished the ui i
24:30 - feel like could use a little bit of work
24:32 - just to make it a bit more intuitive i
24:33 - don't really understand
24:35 - um how some of these things work and you
24:37 - know why they work the way they do maybe
24:39 - it's explained in the readme but it's
24:40 - definitely not super intuitive
24:42 - but other than that interesting project
24:43 - again i'm sure the text-to-speech was
24:45 - really the core of this so i apologize
24:47 - with that said let's talk about the
24:49 - winners of this code jam i'm going to
24:51 - showcase kind of the top three winning
24:53 - projects so just announce the top three
24:54 - winning teams
24:55 - right now all right so now i will
24:57 - announce the three winning team so third
24:59 - second and first place but before i do
25:02 - that a massive thank you to everyone who
25:04 - participated
25:05 - also a huge thank you to my discord
25:06 - staff team which makes this possible
25:09 - i just really don't have enough time to
25:10 - manage all of this stuff and without the
25:12 - staff team that are all
25:13 - strictly volunteers i wouldn't be able
25:15 - to do this so a massive thank you to
25:17 - them and yeah everyone who you know
25:18 - submitted a
25:19 - project so i'm going to go through the
25:21 - three winning teams and i will also just
25:23 - mention that if i did not pick you as a
25:25 - winner you thought i was harsh on your
25:27 - project or didn't see
25:28 - everything i do apologize this is really
25:30 - just meant to be fun
25:31 - yes there is prize money but it's very
25:33 - small and the reason i do this
25:34 - is you know not just to praise people in
25:36 - a youtube video but to give you guys an
25:38 - excuse to work on a project
25:40 - to get out there you know actually code
25:41 - something out work with other people
25:43 - and have something that you can add to
25:44 - your resume and something that's just
25:46 - you know fun to do right
25:47 - so anyways i hope you guys appreciate
25:48 - that but the third place
25:50 - team here is fast so pro box i am giving
25:54 - you guys
25:54 - third place just as a reminder this is
25:56 - the pro box
25:58 - website i thought this was a really
26:00 - great website i really appreciated the
26:01 - code compiler and the code shortener and
26:04 - i just thought this worked
26:05 - great as a virtual assistant definitely
26:07 - fit the theme definitely was polished
26:09 - and yeah it's just really a great
26:11 - project so awesome work um that's really
26:13 - all i can say about it
26:14 - all right and the second place team is
26:17 - team
26:17 - coffee the team that made nc now
26:21 - this project this is one right here i
26:22 - will bring it up this looks
26:24 - awesome really great work on the design
26:26 - i have very little criticism
26:28 - for this uh the dashboard is awesome the
26:30 - landing page is awesome
26:32 - and really the entire project itself is
26:33 - just a great project that really blows
26:35 - me away so
26:36 - anything that i'm about to say now that
26:37 - is criticism please just take it very
26:39 - lightly because
26:41 - genuinely this is super impressive when
26:42 - i first saw it i was blown away
26:44 - so the only thing i'll say about this
26:46 - project and the reason why i didn't get
26:47 - first place
26:48 - was because i thought the design was
26:49 - awesome i thought there was a lot of
26:50 - focus on that but i just thought that
26:52 - the features or what this actually does
26:54 - was fairly underwhelming i think the
26:56 - online assistant is interesting but i
26:57 - don't really know
26:58 - what i'm supposed to ask the online
27:00 - assistant um
27:01 - the actual you know kind of project
27:03 - template here is nice there's some
27:04 - blocks
27:05 - but again i don't feel this has a ton of
27:07 - actual real world function or use
27:10 - i couldn't really see myself going in
27:12 - and using this project
27:13 - maybe some of you guys can but that's
27:15 - personally just me so that is why i came
27:17 - second place but
27:18 - great job really um you guys did an
27:20 - awesome work on this project
27:22 - so congratulations and now i'm going to
27:24 - announce the first
27:25 - place team which is jff which is
27:28 - actually a team of one person who made
27:30 - kryptent now again this could be my bias
27:32 - because i do definitely love
27:33 - cryptocurrency but i just thought that
27:35 - this website out of all of the projects
27:37 - that i saw was the most professional it
27:39 - seemed the most polished
27:40 - and it has so many different things that
27:42 - you can do i actually didn't even go
27:43 - through everything when i was um
27:45 - you know kind of navigating this website
27:46 - but it has the current
27:48 - price of coins so i can actually you
27:49 - know uh submit or look for the
27:52 - price of say bitcoin i can look at the
27:54 - gainers and losers there's actually an
27:56 - api
27:57 - that i'm pretty certain this guy wrote
27:58 - although that's not really a factor in
28:00 - my decision
28:01 - i know the gainers and losers now i just
28:02 - thought this was really professionally
28:03 - done it just looks like a website
28:05 - that really you know could have been
28:07 - made by a professional software engineer
28:09 - so that is why it is getting first place
28:11 - congratulations to that team let's go
28:13 - back here to jff so congratulations
28:16 - to jff i believe this is just for fun
28:19 - is the one who made this again 31 000
28:21 - lines of code you definitely put a lot
28:23 - of effort into this i can appreciate
28:24 - that and well your hard work has paid
28:26 - off
28:27 - and definitely showed itself so with
28:29 - that said i hope you guys enjoyed this
28:31 - video again this is all for fun
28:32 - please don't take this too seriously i
28:34 - would love to see more of you guys
28:36 - participating in the coding competitions
28:37 - so join the discord server from the link
28:39 - in the description
28:40 - and with that said i will see you in
28:42 - another youtube video
28:44 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to the third tech with tim code jam project showcase so in this video i've got five awesome programming projects to show you these are projects that were worked on by the community so subscribers of this channel and people that are part of my discord server and i'm just going to give you some context here about what this competition is and kind of how this works so you can join it if you would like to but if you don't care about that you just want to see the projects there will be some timestamps in the description so go ahead and fast forward to that so every two months i run a coding competition in my discord server this discord server has about 22 000 members we do a ton of other stuff in there as well so we have help channels we have weekly coding challenges and we just do all kinds of other great community things and in the future we're thinking about running stuff like minecraft servers and just other you know great ways to kind of bring the community together around programming and whatever else it is that we're doing so every two months i run this coding competition and pretty much anyone can sign up to participate in this we pick a theme so the coding competition is kind of called a timithon this is you know kind of emulating a hackathon but since it's for techwithsam we're calling it a timithon and this month's or this two months i guess theme was a virtual assistant so this coding competition started january 1st of 2021 participants had a week to find a team and sign up and then they had a month to actually work on a project submit their projects and then there was i believe about a week of community voting so if i go here to the submissions you can see we have all of the teams that actually submitted a project so a ton of people are participating in this which is awesome and then the community goes and votes on their favorite projects and the top five projects projects that receive the most amount of votes get reviewed in a video so like this and then i will pick the top three winning teams and then send them their cash prizes so that's kind of the idea behind this coding competition if you want to participate make sure you join the discord server all of this stuff is ran through discord there'll be a link in the description you can also come to this website right here to check out all of the other projects that i don't show uh you will have to sign in with discord and the link for this website is twt codejam.net again this will be linked in the description you can go to timothon and you can go to view submissions and you can see all the submissions assuming that we have not yet closed this when the video goes live so anyways that is kind of the idea here i've got five projects to show you so let me exit out of this and then i'll go through the projects and then we'll talk about the winners afterwards all right so i've got the first project up in front of me you know i just want to give you some information here before i go through all of this first of all i want to talk to you about how i'm kind of grading these projects or picking who wins now first of all i will say there's a lot of bias in how i'm picking the winner a lot of you guys are kind of upset sometimes and who i decide to pick i'll be brutally honest with you the project that i like the best and kind of ticks my three pieces of criteria which i'll discuss in a second is just the one that i'm going to pick so those three pieces of criteria are how well does the project fit the theme so is this something that is you know right on par with what the theme is in this case it was virtual assistant so pretty easy to fit that theme my next piece of criteria that i'm looking at here is how polished is this project so is this rush does this not look very good does it feel like there's lots of bugs and this is kind of a last minute thing or is this super polished super well done you know everything is thought of and there was a lot of effort put into this project then lastly the thing that i'm looking at is how complicated or difficult is it to make what it is that you have for your project if this is something super simple i may not uh you know like it as much as something that's super complicated and took a lot of hard work to do so anyways those are the three pieces of criteria i'm kind of looking at when i'm you know viewing these projects and anyways let me start going through them so i'm going to start by showing you the project with most votes first and then i will show you second most third most fourth fifth so on uh so we have this first one here which is called nc all of these github repositories i will link in the description and it says researching and creating projects is tedious nc is a virtual assistant developed with the concept of automating research and organizing projects and assignment all right so this is a website really nice read me just small things like this you know make a really good first impression when you're looking at a project we can see this is by team coffee and these are the four contributors here awesome so let me go to the website we're gonna go in full screen mode here and let me start giving you my thoughts now full disclosure i have looked at all of these projects before just to make sure they work and are appropriate before i put them in the video not that any of them have been inappropriate but anyways let's go through this so we have nc the virtual assistant you need summarize narrate personalize get things done with nc nice so there is a video here i'm not going to watch this video but that's a nice touch let's go back to this page here there is a get started so i believe that will bring us and then there's just a nice landing page here so make your projects well managed summarize text or web articles with just a click i'm not going to read through all of this but generally just getting the feel that this looks really professional if you had just sent me this website and didn't tell me this was you know some hobbyist programmer that was in my discord server i would have thought this was just a professional website maybe a startup or something like that looks really great really clean and just really liking how it looks so far anyways let's go to get started so when i go to get start it's going to bring me to my account i've actually already signed in here but you can sign in with google and you can sign in with other services as well which i thought was a really nice touch because i love just that kind of one click sign in you can see i've created two projects here i can create another project let's name this project um what do i want to go with here let's just go with coding okay and let nc provide you with ai generated tips awesome story creating project failed try disabling ai tips feature okay so let's disable that and see if this works and boom okay so it actually did work now we can see there is a little chat bot in the bottom right hand corner here hey hey there it's me nc i found these cool articles thought you might find them useful science science computer science science fiction oh that's interesting so it's kind of like an ai recommending me stuff let's go here computer science this is from wikipedia nice nice that is a cool touch let's go back in here looks like there's some activities that are part of my project that i can say cross off or delete i can also add an activity let's just go with hello even has a little auto saving thing up here just small features like that i really appreciate like the ui is really clean it just seems really intuitive let's add some blocks so let's just go with coding we can add a paragraph block coding is great looks like i can add an image or some text things nice nice okay i can also export this let's see what happens when i press export oh wow okay so i can export this as a text document that's really interesting nice let's see what else we can do here let's chat with the bot hi glad to see you back dude nice that's awesome um what else should i ask this let's see when was coding started i know that doesn't really make much sense i did not receive a response can you try again what is my name uh hey i'm nc okay makes sense all right so let's close that looks like i can summarize text and articles summarize stuff here okay nc is an artificial intelligence based on transformers which is wide leaves oh that's how it works all right nc is a powerful text summarizer which gives you a summary of text or a web page it also gives you suggestions from wikipedia articles and important keywords okay that's interesting so let's summarize this computer science article right here so url article let's summarize that and let's see what we get all right so it looks like the summary came up it looks like it has some keywords here from the article i mean these seem to make sense uh computer science i won't read through all of that but it does look like that this makes sense in his properly formed sentences then it has some other articles to look at glossary of computer science uh does that open up a new page now it's loading i'll wait for that to load oh awesome and it brings me to this page right here okay so really cool i think that's all to look at for this project i might be missing something but it looks like i can do stuff like delete projects yeah i'm going to delete that one right here and everything just seems to be functioning this seems really polished just a lot of these small touches even just small things like the date here the ui the fact that there's you know highlights on the buttons this little online button it just looks really clean it looks really professional and i'm really impressed by this project and specifically the ui and kind of design of this so good job guys this is really impressive pat yourself on the back now let's move on to project number two all right so the next project that i have is called pro box the toolbox for programmers same thing here really nice and simple looking readme first thing i look at when i look at these projects just to read me right and so having a nice readme is already just a great addition nice little image here that they created uh shows me i guess yeah code jam timothon that's cool platform web browser repo size nice nice and this is a website as well so this is by who does it say the contributors are um i can't find all of the contributors in here uh does it say the team that did this uh maybe on the side ah here they are okay so we have these three guys i've seen snowball and fireplank before excuse me if i haven't seen you before but these two definitely participate in some other code gyms awesome so let's go to pro box this is the website right here let's make this full screen zoom in a little bit it looks like there's just a bunch of tools that we can use so code compiler let's try this out oh this is really cool okay this kind of reminds me of like the leak code interface almost um the way that it looks i can change my editor oh let's go with that this is my favorite uh font this is a python template let's say print hello run let's see who we get and hello okay awesome i have no idea how they did this by the way i'm super impressed i can write in c plus plus two um compiling nice ruby lua node.js wow awesome i can remove the cache damn super impressive that's just one of the tools they have a code shortener okay i'm not actually going to use this but i can see that it just shortens the code like this which is really interesting um changes all the variable names and everything wow that's impressive as well uh dictionary let's search something let's search for tim okay clearly there's no definition for tim let's go with like book oh wow okay nice code awesome let's try out the calculator 85 times 96 okay let's go yeah mod or divide or percent whatever it is okay 81.6 nice can get out of that stack overflow uh how to reverse a linked list let's see what we get here create a new links list reverse linked list python load more damn okay this is really cool i'm not gonna click on these i trust that these links do work um yeah it looks like this is a link okay awesome um voice recorder we can try this uh notice this might not work but another app is using the current webcam wait is this video or voice recorder which one do i pre oh video recorder sorry um yeah so my webcam is obviously being used right now so i can't test this out uh but i did look at that previously and it was actually working uh voice recorder this will this work if my mic is being used by something else hopefully uh we're doing a test recording here i want to see if this works okay let's play this okay so i think that is working my speaker's actually off but you guys probably should have heard it through obs so i'm going to trust that works i did test that before and it was working uh regex templates this one is actually really cool i really love that they have these because these are super useful and like you're always looking this kind of stuff up uh so json ipv4 visa card csv mastercard nice nice okay um github so i believe this is oh it just brings you the github for this project okay that makes sense let's go back here to pro box they have a whiteboard uh let's do some drawing here okay so i can't change the color or anything but i mean that makes sense let's reset that awesome there is an ascii chart this is really useful too i can look for all of the characters and see what their ascii code is nice they have a todo list i watch some attack with tim videos i like how that's already ticked off bonus points for that uh add oops add this item okay let's add that seems to be working very nice we can reset that i love how the default is these two that's funny and yeah it looks like that is the entire project oh there's also a home page okay this is a really nice looking homepage i didn't even see this before try the tools you are a programmer some kind of nice motion again the design has just really been blowing me away from these projects that you guys have done this is really impressive we've got a contact page yeah same thing here just some nice animation and movement i can change the background color okay so that goes to green we can change this back to white wow really impressive so that is project number two uh kind of my same thoughts as project one i'm just really blown away by the design and what you guys have done on the front here just looks really professional and really nice um the tools i mean some of these are pretty useful i'm not gonna lie a lot of them are kind of just thrown in here i think just to add some more tools but definitely interesting the code shortener and code compiler i'm really interested by i don't know how you guys did that so that's super impressive uh ascii chart was a nice addition regex templates same thing awesome so now let's move on to the third project all right so the next project i have here is called kryptent uh is that how you pronounce that i have no idea if that's how you say it there's a really long readme here that goes through a ton of stuff i'm not going to go through this but pretty much this is a cryptocurrency like information site or something like that i haven't looked at it a ton i'm trying to find who this is by but i don't see any contributors let's go to the insights and see if we can find this uh contributors looks like we have one guys tech guy 940 31 000 lines of code wow this looks like a pretty awesome project damn you can kind of see the contributing graph okay sweet so let's go to cry uh krypton tier i'm probably going to keep pronouncing it wrong i'm going to say get candlestick graph for any cryptocurrency oh yeah it just says the same thing get started know more about candlesticks go about let's see this wow okay this is a really professional looking website damn get in touch facebook youtube twitter instagram um again super blown away by this it just looks great i'm i don't know how to make something that looks like this services ai advice let's see here um wow okay you can get it but i don't know if this is real or not if he's actually if he actually does this but this is really cool you can submit a prediction um for different coins nice um cryptant ai advice uh cryptocurrency news let's see what's here latest news wow god damn okay this is really cool this just looks like a professional website candlestick graph let's try this one out okay so let's do this was what was on the homepage let's try this uh time interval one minute let's go with one day and yeah sure let's get the graph of bitcoin and wow okay it generates a candlestick graph i wonder what is being used to do this but that's really interesting shows me the highs and the lows this is super speedy and snappy let's do litecoin one of my favorite coins let's see what this one is awesome can i change this oh i can save this too wow and let's see what else they have api okay so this shows you the actual api that i don't know if this guy designed or that just exists that he's using but that's really interesting it's on postman uh let's go back here to this website uh so the thing that i don't like here though is that this is opening like different web pages for every single thing that's my only critique so far i just i don't like when uh websites do that let's go to the contact okay it just brings us to the bottom of whatever this page was and i think that's all i have to go through for this website i do apologize guys if i'm missing stuff i'm just kind of trying to get a quick look at this i can't go through every single possible feature but this one is super impressive it's also very timely with all the cryptocurrency stuff going on right now and yeah as i'm saying with all these projects like if you just showed this to me and you didn't tell me that you know this was some hobbyist program working on this that was a part of my discord server i would genuinely just think this was another professional website i wouldn't question it looks great everything seems to be working and again awesome job on this project especially because it was just one person who did this so now let's move on to project four all right so in front of me here i've got project four this one is called violet i'll just read the description here so violet provides you with five core features a news feed with selectable categories a text editor with the added functionality of text to speech an online recipe browser quick access to common social media sites and a todo list awesome so to access this this is a website let me close all of these uh these website links here okay let's go to this and let's scroll down so we have a todo list latest news stay connected texttospeech view recipes and more features coming soon let's get started here okay it's going to take a second to load all right so i have to create an account so let's do this let's just make this tech with tim let's see if it will allow my extremely weak password and it looks like it does okay so no little message telling me that i actually create an account first critique there on kind of the ui side let's log into this and okay wow here we are so this is the website let's go full screen mode so we can go to youtube google reddit instagram all of the other logos that i'm sure you guys know um blaze with the fire that is never extinguished oh interesting okay create a list enter time enter task let's just go with film this video okay do i need to enter a time um what do i have to do for this say like february 25th or something uh oh okay perfect so it does actually work february 25th film this video uh news let's see what news is giving me okay this is interesting so whatever is going on here just showing me a bunch of news can i change the categories oh yes i can't let's go to technology news i don't really care about the world news right now one thing that i am noticing is this website is quite slow i'm not going to dock anything for that because this just hosts on heroku um the images are also pretty stretched but that's fine looks like i can click on these if i want but that's cool showing me a bunch of different news articles text to speech whoa okay so i can i guess write like an entire thing here let's go hello let's change this text to be bold bold do i have to highlight it and press bold or something okay so i don't know maybe bold's just not working or maybe i'm just an idiot and i don't know how this works um let's go with italic again do i have to highlight this for the maybe these buttons just don't work i'm not sure if i'm doing this incorrectly or something but a lot of these buttons just don't seem to do anything okay the underline work just the italic and the bold doesn't seem to do anything that's fine can i align this in the center okay so that does work i have a what is this a ruler or something i can add notes awesome oh i can also export that and then there's the text speech thing nice recipes let's search for a recipe when they say recipe i'm not really sure what they mean are they talking about like food recipes uh let's just go with a recipe for pizza see how to make pizza dough okay so i guess it is uh food recipes so uh you know a little bit offset here but totally fine this oh internal server error okay interesting i believe that's just a heroku issue again i'm not gonna you know dock any marks or whatever because this is uh host on heroku um serves unknown cook 30 to 60 minutes serves two cook 10 to 30 minutes okay it's interesting that they're able to actually find this information i'm not sure what they're pulling this from i have my account and yeah i think that's pretty much all for this let's go to google this just bring me it just brings me to google okay interesting all right so i guess that is the violet project now my thoughts on this one first of all i will just say this is obviously not as polished as some of the other projects doesn't mean this is not still a great project just kind of hard to uh you know compete with all of those other ones i also don't know how many people worked on this other kind of piece of critique here that i will say is that these categories don't really make much sense to me in terms of how they go together they seem very distinct and different so like news texttospeech recipes it's fine there's no rule that says they have to go together i'm just a little bit confused why these ones were picked i like the fact that we have the quotes here i like that there's lots of different features and that for the most part they're all working with the exception of a few buttons um seems like everything is just functioning as it should be and well i mean this is a cool project it's not really much more for me to say so with that said let's move on to project five all right so in front of me i've got project five this one is by the champions clan team i believe and this is called robert virtual assistant so robert your own virtual assistant with a beautiful text and speech based interface you can see that they have some nice gifs and stuff here i appreciate the effort put into this readme and kind of all the styling and the emojis and everything you've got um so apparently the way that this works is it's a background application that sits in your system tray and then you can activate it with uh like hotkeys like shift plus seven shift plus six now i did read this entire readme i read all of the readmes before i actually went ahead and worked on the project so i will run this code but i will mention just right now that the actual voice assistant part of this project at least on my computer is not working it works once and then doesn't really do anything after that so i will just say that i tried very hard to get this to work i appreciate the effort you guys put into this and i spent about 20 or 30 minutes trying to figure this out i couldn't figure it out and so i don't know what to tell you but i'm only going to be able to review one part of your project so anyways let me run this code and then i'll be right back all right so i've got the code running right here now the idea is that there's supposed to be something in my system tray that has kind of uh this logo right here i'm supposed to be able to press shift seven or shift six on my keyboard which i'm doing right now and it's supposed to like activate a virtual assistant now it's not doing that and i don't know why you can see the keyboard shortcuts are here i can change the the mode of this application okay that's interesting let's leave it at dark mode and they have code snippets so i believe what i can do here is i can save code snippets so i can have like a file i guess that's located somewhere and then this will just organize them all for me so let's try this uh let's find a code snippet here let's just snip it one of their codes well we can snip it main dot pi uh type name of your code let's just go with python okay and there you go so now i can save the snippet and i guess i don't know what happens when i press on this doesn't seem like anything maybe i'm doing this incorrectly anyways i guess you can save code snippets you can sort them by language or by alphabet i can search for snippets nice i have translations let's go hello world and let's translate okay bonjour le monde i don't speak french very well obviously nice looks like that's working uh task manager you can see i added this one in previously uh tim is great obviously that's going to be there i can edit a task let's change the name to be hello testing priority okay there's five priority levels that's nice i guess it's going to show me the highest priority for first in fact we can test that let's change this to five uh oops tim tim is great okay save uh and yes okay so that did actually update i can add another task go test and add that one in i guess i have to add a description as well so let's add that okay nice so i can tick them off true true okay so i guess they forgot to remove the debugging there that's fine and then what else is there here there is a reminder so it looks like i can set some types of alarms so i can turn that on uh in one hour i guess that will send an alarm i don't know how that alarm is going to work but i guess that will function like that okay nice and i guess that's all for this project now uh there's the settings okay so first of all nice project i i really do apologize that i can't get the texttospeech to work i imagine that that's really the core part of this application again i did try to run this i even tried just running the file and it works but it doesn't give me any output so i'm not going to show it in this video there's no point in doing that i do apologize but that's all i have to say so interesting project obviously not super polished the ui i feel like could use a little bit of work just to make it a bit more intuitive i don't really understand um how some of these things work and you know why they work the way they do maybe it's explained in the readme but it's definitely not super intuitive but other than that interesting project again i'm sure the texttospeech was really the core of this so i apologize with that said let's talk about the winners of this code jam i'm going to showcase kind of the top three winning projects so just announce the top three winning teams right now all right so now i will announce the three winning team so third second and first place but before i do that a massive thank you to everyone who participated also a huge thank you to my discord staff team which makes this possible i just really don't have enough time to manage all of this stuff and without the staff team that are all strictly volunteers i wouldn't be able to do this so a massive thank you to them and yeah everyone who you know submitted a project so i'm going to go through the three winning teams and i will also just mention that if i did not pick you as a winner you thought i was harsh on your project or didn't see everything i do apologize this is really just meant to be fun yes there is prize money but it's very small and the reason i do this is you know not just to praise people in a youtube video but to give you guys an excuse to work on a project to get out there you know actually code something out work with other people and have something that you can add to your resume and something that's just you know fun to do right so anyways i hope you guys appreciate that but the third place team here is fast so pro box i am giving you guys third place just as a reminder this is the pro box website i thought this was a really great website i really appreciated the code compiler and the code shortener and i just thought this worked great as a virtual assistant definitely fit the theme definitely was polished and yeah it's just really a great project so awesome work um that's really all i can say about it all right and the second place team is team coffee the team that made nc now this project this is one right here i will bring it up this looks awesome really great work on the design i have very little criticism for this uh the dashboard is awesome the landing page is awesome and really the entire project itself is just a great project that really blows me away so anything that i'm about to say now that is criticism please just take it very lightly because genuinely this is super impressive when i first saw it i was blown away so the only thing i'll say about this project and the reason why i didn't get first place was because i thought the design was awesome i thought there was a lot of focus on that but i just thought that the features or what this actually does was fairly underwhelming i think the online assistant is interesting but i don't really know what i'm supposed to ask the online assistant um the actual you know kind of project template here is nice there's some blocks but again i don't feel this has a ton of actual real world function or use i couldn't really see myself going in and using this project maybe some of you guys can but that's personally just me so that is why i came second place but great job really um you guys did an awesome work on this project so congratulations and now i'm going to announce the first place team which is jff which is actually a team of one person who made kryptent now again this could be my bias because i do definitely love cryptocurrency but i just thought that this website out of all of the projects that i saw was the most professional it seemed the most polished and it has so many different things that you can do i actually didn't even go through everything when i was um you know kind of navigating this website but it has the current price of coins so i can actually you know uh submit or look for the price of say bitcoin i can look at the gainers and losers there's actually an api that i'm pretty certain this guy wrote although that's not really a factor in my decision i know the gainers and losers now i just thought this was really professionally done it just looks like a website that really you know could have been made by a professional software engineer so that is why it is getting first place congratulations to that team let's go back here to jff so congratulations to jff i believe this is just for fun is the one who made this again 31 000 lines of code you definitely put a lot of effort into this i can appreciate that and well your hard work has paid off and definitely showed itself so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed this video again this is all for fun please don't take this too seriously i would love to see more of you guys participating in the coding competitions so join the discord server from the link in the description and with that said i will see you in another youtube video
