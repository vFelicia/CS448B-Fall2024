00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video what I'm gonna be doing is
00:03 - sharing with you my top four machine
00:05 - learning techniques that you need to
00:07 - know now there's so many different ways
00:08 - of doing machine learning and artificial
00:10 - intelligence but these are kind of the
00:11 - four main methods and you need to
00:13 - understand what these methods are so you
00:15 - can appropriately pick the right one for
00:17 - whatever project you're working on it's
00:19 - one thing to go through tutorials and to
00:21 - watch other people apply specific
00:23 - algorithms to specific projects but to
00:25 - actually be able to pick which algorithm
00:27 - that you're gonna use for your own
00:28 - project is its own skill and hopefully
00:30 - this video will help you do that so
00:32 - without further ado we're gonna have a
00:33 - quick word from our sponsor and then
00:34 - we'll get right into it before we get
00:36 - started I would like to thank simply
00:37 - learn for sponsoring this video and
00:39 - giving you all 10% off their data
00:40 - science master's course by enrolling
00:42 - with the code data with Tim this course
00:45 - will give you hands-on exposure to key
00:46 - technologies including our Python
00:48 - tableau Hadoop and spark and you'll
00:50 - receive world-class training by an
00:52 - industry leader on the most in-demand
00:53 - data science and machine learning skills
00:55 - since this course is co-developed with
00:57 - IBM you'll receive perks such as twelve
00:59 - hundred US dollars worth of IBM cloud
01:01 - credits access to IBM cloud platforms
01:04 - such as IBM Watson and digital badges
01:06 - from IBM you can check it out at the
01:08 - link in the description so I want to
01:09 - make it clear distinction just to start
01:11 - the video here on what I mean by machine
01:13 - learning a lot of people confuse
01:15 - artificial intelligence and machine
01:16 - learning and to be honest with you the
01:18 - internet does not make this easy to kind
01:20 - of distinguish between a lot of people
01:21 - will label their stuff as machine
01:23 - learning when really you know it's a
01:24 - different artificial intelligence strain
01:26 - or they'll say AI and it's not Mitch if
01:28 - people get really confused so let's
01:29 - clear it up right now
01:30 - machine learning is a strain of
01:32 - artificial intelligence artificial
01:34 - intelligence is kind of the top tier and
01:36 - everything kind of trickles down from
01:38 - there where machine learning is its own
01:40 - kind of topic within artificial
01:42 - intelligence you can have other things
01:44 - like evolutionary algorithms or you
01:46 - could have different kind of AI
01:47 - algorithms that do specific things that
01:49 - are in their own little bubble machine
01:51 - learning is one of its own bubbles that
01:53 - strains from artificial intelligence now
01:55 - the topics I'm gonna be talking about
01:56 - here in the methods are kind of strains
01:59 - off of machine learning so the different
02:01 - types of machine learning they're not
02:03 - necessarily algorithms there's
02:05 - algorithms that are involved with these
02:07 - methods but they're kind of their own
02:08 - strain and different algorithms will fit
02:10 - into that so with that being said let's
02:12 - talk about the
02:13 - first algorithm which is reinforcement
02:15 - learning now reinforcement learning is a
02:17 - very popular method for training AIS to
02:19 - play video games and that's kind of the
02:21 - example I'm gonna use to explain how
02:23 - this works now reinforcement learning is
02:25 - learning by trial and error and
02:27 - essentially what that means is our AI
02:29 - starts off being extremely stupid having
02:31 - no idea what to do it's seen no prior
02:33 - data before and doesn't know what the
02:35 - level looks like it doesn't know
02:36 - anything and it starts taking random
02:39 - actions so this is where I'm gonna
02:40 - introduce to us three concepts an agent
02:43 - and environment and a reward now our
02:45 - agent is gonna be our artificial
02:46 - intelligence and in this case when we're
02:48 - talking about a game it would be the
02:49 - player of the game or whatever AI you're
02:51 - trying to train our environment is gonna
02:54 - be if we're talking about a game maybe
02:55 - the level in which this agent is playing
02:57 - but in other situations your environment
02:59 - is kind of what you're exploring and
03:01 - what you're trying to optimize or do the
03:02 - best in and then we have a reward and
03:05 - the reward is what our agent is trying
03:06 - to maximize the agent is going to be
03:09 - navigating the environment and based on
03:11 - the actions it takes it's going to be
03:12 - given a reward that reward will come you
03:15 - know from the programmer they will
03:16 - determine what reward the agent gets at
03:18 - what specific scenario for doing what
03:20 - specific action and essentially the goal
03:22 - of the agent is maximize this roar
03:25 - so it starts navigating the level kind
03:27 - of figuring out what it needs to do in
03:29 - navigating the environment and as it
03:31 - does this it starts to realize based on
03:33 - the actions it takes which actions
03:35 - maximize the reward so if we're talking
03:37 - about maybe a Mario game for example
03:39 - Mario will start off maybe running left
03:41 - so going out of the level and it will be
03:43 - given a negative reward and told don't
03:45 - do that stop doing that so the next time
03:47 - this happens it's gonna go the other
03:49 - direction because it says well I know
03:51 - left is bad that minimizes my reward so
03:53 - where can I go to maximize it so don't
03:55 - start going right and then maybe it hits
03:57 - an obstacle it's gonna back okay so when
03:59 - I get to that point rather than hitting
04:01 - the obstacle which gives me a negative
04:02 - reward let's go around the obstacle
04:04 - let's do something that gives me a
04:06 - positive reward and this is the basic
04:08 - premise of reinforcement learning and
04:10 - now on to our next topic which is
04:12 - supervised machine learning now a lot of
04:14 - people to classify this as kind of the
04:16 - most basic and most boring form of
04:18 - machine learning and I would agree but
04:20 - that also makes it one of the most
04:22 - useful now a lot of people that get into
04:24 - machine learning think that you need to
04:25 - use very advanced MA
04:27 - to use neural networks and crazy
04:29 - evolutionary things to solve problems
04:31 - when in reality a lot of the problems
04:33 - that you have can actually be solved
04:35 - with supervised machine learning models
04:37 - now what is supervised machine learning
04:39 - well you start in supervised machine
04:41 - learning with some previous knowledge or
04:43 - some previous data that is step one
04:44 - you're not going to be doing supervised
04:46 - machine learning unless you have some
04:47 - data to work with and what you're going
04:49 - to be doing is essentially trying to
04:51 - come up with some function that can map
04:53 - the input of your data to the output of
04:55 - your data the reason you want to do this
04:57 - is because you have all this previous
04:59 - data and you want to come up with some
05:01 - kind of correlations between them so you
05:03 - want to say hey maybe if a student has
05:05 - high grades that would relate with them
05:07 - studying for a long amount of hours so
05:09 - what you're gonna do is say okay we
05:10 - handled this previous data we're gonna
05:11 - feed it into this machine learning
05:13 - algorithm and it's gonna come up with
05:15 - this function and your goal is with this
05:17 - function that when you pass it some
05:19 - input data that it's never seen before
05:21 - so some data that you're trying to make
05:23 - a prediction for it can give you an
05:25 - accurate prediction for that specific
05:27 - value so that's why you need a lot of
05:29 - data usually to make this work well so
05:31 - what you're gonna do is feed you know
05:32 - the input of this data into the model
05:35 - it's gonna look at it it's gonna spit
05:36 - out some output it's gonna compare that
05:38 - output to what the output should be and
05:40 - then say okay I need to make a tweak
05:42 - here or tune here to make this function
05:44 - a little bit better and this is why it's
05:46 - called a supervised machine learning
05:47 - algorithm because you can almost think
05:49 - of it as like a teacher teaching the
05:51 - model what to do and how to get better
05:52 - where it starts not being very good but
05:55 - as it sees more and more data the
05:56 - teachers like know do that do that you
05:58 - need to fix that tweak that it gets
06:00 - better better better better until you
06:02 - reach a point where you're satisfied
06:03 - with the accuracy of your model and that
06:06 - is supervised machine learning and the
06:08 - next topic to talk about is unsupervised
06:11 - machine learning so in supervised
06:13 - machine learning what we had was some
06:15 - input data and he actually had the
06:16 - answer to that input Deb so we had for
06:19 - example all this information about a
06:21 - student and maybe we're trying to
06:22 - predict their final grade we actually
06:24 - had a bunch of previous students final
06:26 - grades so when we ran through the model
06:28 - we could tell the model when it got
06:30 - something wrong hey you were you know
06:32 - one grade point off from what this grade
06:34 - actually should be based on your current
06:35 - state so let's tune you a bit let's fix
06:37 - you a bit and let's get better
06:39 - unsupervised machine learning we don't
06:41 - actually have the answers to our data we
06:44 - have a ton of different data and we
06:46 - actually don't know what kind of the
06:48 - answer is for what we're looking for the
06:50 - problem itself is slightly undefined and
06:53 - what we're trying to actually do with
06:54 - unsupervised machine learning is have
06:56 - the computer or the algorithm come up
06:59 - with some correlations between our data
07:01 - that we can't see ourselves so maybe
07:03 - we're trying to predict you know
07:05 - something with supervised machine
07:06 - learning we want to figure out what a
07:08 - grades gonna be we want to cluster this
07:10 - information together we want to classify
07:11 - something and we actually know the
07:14 - correct answer whereas here we want to
07:16 - come up with things about our data that
07:17 - we don't know so this is where we talk
07:19 - about something called clustering now I
07:21 - think I made a mistake and I mentioned
07:22 - clustering with supervised machine
07:23 - learning that is not correct
07:25 - clustering typically is gonna be an
07:27 - unsupervised machine learning in a
07:29 - common algorithm in unsupervised machine
07:30 - learning is k-means clustering where
07:33 - maybe we feed a bunch of data points so
07:35 - we only have input data we feed a ton of
07:36 - data points to our model or algorithm
07:39 - and what it does is actually clusters
07:42 - and figures out which data points are
07:43 - related together so maybe we're trying
07:45 - to figure out what you know information
07:47 - will relate someone to be a part of a
07:49 - specific ethnic group or something like
07:51 - that we're looking at some big data well
07:53 - we don't know how many groups we might
07:54 - have in our data how they might be we
07:56 - don't want to specify those so we just
07:58 - pass this information into the computer
07:59 - it does some of this magic stuff with
08:02 - the unsupervised machine learning
08:03 - algorithm and spits back to us a bunch
08:05 - of different clusters of this group and
08:07 - when we pass in a new data point that we
08:10 - haven't seen before well what it does is
08:12 - say okay you are a part of this cluster
08:14 - or you are a part of this group so
08:16 - unsupervised machine learning algorithms
08:18 - are typically used to try to figure out
08:20 - stuff about the data we're trying to
08:22 - determine different groups or different
08:23 - kind of pieces of information and some
08:25 - abstract correlations that we maybe
08:27 - can't see ourself as a programmer or as
08:29 - someone that's analyzing the information
08:31 - a final reminder that if you're
08:33 - interested in becoming an expert in data
08:34 - science to consider the simply learned
08:36 - data science masters course it's
08:38 - comprised of six full courses including
08:40 - our programming data science with Python
08:42 - machine learning tableau desktop
08:44 - qualified associate training Big Data
08:46 - Hadoop spark developer and data science
08:49 - capstone and has three electives such as
08:51 - IBM Watson for chatbots
08:52 - machine learning with our data science
08:55 - with sass now during this course should
08:57 - work on 15 plus real-life projects and
08:59 - learned 30 plus in-demand skills with
09:02 - lifetime access to all of the course
09:04 - content this course is listed at $1,300
09:06 - which is as low as 115 dollars a month
09:08 - and you can use the discount code data
09:10 - with Tim for a limited time at 10%
09:11 - discount I would personally recommend
09:13 - this course and encourage you guys to
09:15 - take advantage of this offer and now to
09:17 - talk about deep learning
09:19 - now deep learning is by far one of the
09:22 - most kind of looked up to and just like
09:24 - advanced parts of machine learning now a
09:27 - lot of people that get into machine
09:28 - learning just immediately jump into deep
09:30 - learning they see all these neural
09:32 - network things on YouTube they see
09:33 - neural network neural network neural
09:34 - network and they start just learning it
09:36 - and doing it and this was great and you
09:38 - can do this but deep learning is really
09:40 - not applicable to a lot of different
09:42 - tasks or maybe it is but it's way
09:45 - overkill and you could solve a lot of
09:47 - the same tasks that people are doing
09:48 - with deep learning and neural networks
09:50 - which is basic supervised machine
09:52 - learning algorithms or reinforcement
09:53 - learning are simple you know very basic
09:56 - things to setup and to work with so what
09:59 - is deep learning well I've kind of said
10:01 - it already but it's pretty much just
10:02 - working within their own networks now
10:04 - the reason we call this deep is because
10:06 - a neural network has more than one layer
10:09 - so whereas in our other algorithms we
10:11 - kind of just had an input and an output
10:13 - and we had a function that kind of
10:15 - classified or did something with that
10:16 - with a neural network we have layers so
10:19 - we have an input layer we have some
10:20 - hidden layers in the middle we have an
10:22 - output layer and our data actually gets
10:24 - passed through all of these different
10:26 - layers to pick out specific high-level
10:29 - features of it now this is why neural
10:32 - networks are used a lot for
10:34 - classification tasks related to things
10:36 - that have patterns in them so for
10:38 - example doing object detection or image
10:41 - recognition a classic example is going
10:43 - to be with the amnestied data set what
10:45 - essentially you're hoping a neural
10:46 - network is gonna do when you train it on
10:48 - a data set like an amnesty data set
10:50 - which essentially is a bunch of
10:51 - handwritten digits and you want to
10:52 - figure out if there's zeros or if
10:54 - they're ones 2 through 9 is you're gonna
10:56 - pass all the pixels of this image in and
10:58 - then the network's actually gonna look
11:01 - at these pixels try to pick out like
11:02 - lines and features and curves and edges
11:05 - of it and
11:06 - and what the number is based on seeing
11:08 - all those different features that it's
11:10 - kind of created and and figured out so
11:12 - neural networks are really good at
11:14 - looking at higher dimensional features
11:16 - that you can't specifically see in the
11:18 - data set or that actually don't exist it
11:20 - will create those features for you based
11:22 - on the input that you're giving it but
11:23 - this means that it's very complicated
11:26 - it's very complex
11:27 - you don't usually understand how you're
11:29 - actually solving the problem when you're
11:30 - using a neural network because you kind
11:32 - of just give some input you get an
11:34 - output and you don't have any idea what
11:35 - happens in between and that's the
11:37 - dangerous thing when you run into an
11:38 - issue where your neural networks not
11:40 - performing correctly it's very difficult
11:42 - to tweak it and modify it and a lot of
11:44 - the times there's not much you can do
11:45 - because you really just don't understand
11:47 - what's happening in the middle so this
11:49 - has been kind of the four main topics in
11:51 - machine learning now I always like to
11:53 - say that I am no expert there's a lot
11:56 - that I still need to learn I'm a student
11:58 - myself and this stuff is really
11:59 - interesting to me and that's why I go
12:01 - out of my way to make videos like this
12:02 - and to teach other people because I want
12:04 - them to be able to learn the same things
12:06 - that I've done I find a lot of people on
12:08 - the internet what they do is explain
12:10 - things super complicated and just try to
12:12 - make it seem like they're very smart
12:13 - that's really not how I want to come off
12:15 - I want to explain this to you guys as
12:17 - simply as possible so that you can you
12:19 - know go out there and learn it yourself
12:20 - a lot of this stuff is really not that
12:22 - hard it's just you have to have a little
12:24 - bit of knowledge and know where to look
12:26 - to find the information so with that
12:28 - being said that has been the video if
12:30 - you guys learn something you'd like this
12:32 - and you want more content like this
12:33 - please leave a like on the video leave a
12:35 - comment down below and subscribe to the
12:37 - channel and with that being said I will
12:38 - see you guys

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I'm gonna be doing is sharing with you my top four machine learning techniques that you need to know now there's so many different ways of doing machine learning and artificial intelligence but these are kind of the four main methods and you need to understand what these methods are so you can appropriately pick the right one for whatever project you're working on it's one thing to go through tutorials and to watch other people apply specific algorithms to specific projects but to actually be able to pick which algorithm that you're gonna use for your own project is its own skill and hopefully this video will help you do that so without further ado we're gonna have a quick word from our sponsor and then we'll get right into it before we get started I would like to thank simply learn for sponsoring this video and giving you all 10% off their data science master's course by enrolling with the code data with Tim this course will give you handson exposure to key technologies including our Python tableau Hadoop and spark and you'll receive worldclass training by an industry leader on the most indemand data science and machine learning skills since this course is codeveloped with IBM you'll receive perks such as twelve hundred US dollars worth of IBM cloud credits access to IBM cloud platforms such as IBM Watson and digital badges from IBM you can check it out at the link in the description so I want to make it clear distinction just to start the video here on what I mean by machine learning a lot of people confuse artificial intelligence and machine learning and to be honest with you the internet does not make this easy to kind of distinguish between a lot of people will label their stuff as machine learning when really you know it's a different artificial intelligence strain or they'll say AI and it's not Mitch if people get really confused so let's clear it up right now machine learning is a strain of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is kind of the top tier and everything kind of trickles down from there where machine learning is its own kind of topic within artificial intelligence you can have other things like evolutionary algorithms or you could have different kind of AI algorithms that do specific things that are in their own little bubble machine learning is one of its own bubbles that strains from artificial intelligence now the topics I'm gonna be talking about here in the methods are kind of strains off of machine learning so the different types of machine learning they're not necessarily algorithms there's algorithms that are involved with these methods but they're kind of their own strain and different algorithms will fit into that so with that being said let's talk about the first algorithm which is reinforcement learning now reinforcement learning is a very popular method for training AIS to play video games and that's kind of the example I'm gonna use to explain how this works now reinforcement learning is learning by trial and error and essentially what that means is our AI starts off being extremely stupid having no idea what to do it's seen no prior data before and doesn't know what the level looks like it doesn't know anything and it starts taking random actions so this is where I'm gonna introduce to us three concepts an agent and environment and a reward now our agent is gonna be our artificial intelligence and in this case when we're talking about a game it would be the player of the game or whatever AI you're trying to train our environment is gonna be if we're talking about a game maybe the level in which this agent is playing but in other situations your environment is kind of what you're exploring and what you're trying to optimize or do the best in and then we have a reward and the reward is what our agent is trying to maximize the agent is going to be navigating the environment and based on the actions it takes it's going to be given a reward that reward will come you know from the programmer they will determine what reward the agent gets at what specific scenario for doing what specific action and essentially the goal of the agent is maximize this roar so it starts navigating the level kind of figuring out what it needs to do in navigating the environment and as it does this it starts to realize based on the actions it takes which actions maximize the reward so if we're talking about maybe a Mario game for example Mario will start off maybe running left so going out of the level and it will be given a negative reward and told don't do that stop doing that so the next time this happens it's gonna go the other direction because it says well I know left is bad that minimizes my reward so where can I go to maximize it so don't start going right and then maybe it hits an obstacle it's gonna back okay so when I get to that point rather than hitting the obstacle which gives me a negative reward let's go around the obstacle let's do something that gives me a positive reward and this is the basic premise of reinforcement learning and now on to our next topic which is supervised machine learning now a lot of people to classify this as kind of the most basic and most boring form of machine learning and I would agree but that also makes it one of the most useful now a lot of people that get into machine learning think that you need to use very advanced MA to use neural networks and crazy evolutionary things to solve problems when in reality a lot of the problems that you have can actually be solved with supervised machine learning models now what is supervised machine learning well you start in supervised machine learning with some previous

to come up with some function that can map the input of your data to the output of your data the reason you want to do this is because you have all this previous data and you want to come up with some kind of correlations between them so you want to say hey maybe if a student has high grades that would relate with them studying for a long amount of hours so what you're gonna do is say okay we handled this previous data we're gonna feed it into this machine learning algorithm and it's gonna come up with this function and your goal is with this function that when you pass it some input data that it's never seen before so some data that you're trying to make a prediction for it can give you an accurate prediction for that specific value so that's why you need a lot of data usually to make this work well so what you're gonna do is feed you know the input of this data into the model it's gonna look at it it's gonna spit out some output it's gonna compare that output to what the output should be and then say okay I need to make a tweak here or tune here to make this function a little bit better and this is why it's called a supervised machine learning algorithm because you can almost think of it as like a teacher teaching the model what to do and how to get better where it starts not being very good but as it sees more and more data the teachers like know do that do that you need to fix that tweak that it gets better better better better until you reach a point where you're satisfied with the accuracy of your model and that is supervised machine learning and the next topic to talk about is unsupervised machine learning so in supervised machine learning what we had was some input data and he actually had the answer to that input Deb so we had for example all this information about a student and maybe we're trying to predict their final grade we actually had a bunch of previous students final grades so when we ran through the model we could tell the model when it got something wrong hey you were you know one grade point off from what this grade actually should be based on your current state so let's tune you a bit let's fix you a bit and let's get better unsupervised machine learning we don't actually have the answers to our data we have a ton of different data and we actually don't know what kind of the answer is for what we're looking for the problem itself is slightly undefined and what we're trying to actually do with unsupervised machine learning is have the computer or the algorithm come up with some correlations between our data that we can't see ourselves so maybe we're trying to predict you know something with supervised machine learning we want to figure out what a grades gonna be we want to cluster this information together we want to classify something and we actually know the correct answer whereas here we want to come up with things about our data that we don't know so this is where we talk about something called clustering now I think I made a mistake and I mentioned clustering with supervised machine learning that is not correct clustering typically is gonna be an unsupervised machine learning in a common algorithm in unsupervised machine learning is kmeans clustering where maybe we feed a bunch of data points so we only have input data we feed a ton of data points to our model or algorithm and what it does is actually clusters and figures out which data points are related together so maybe we're trying to figure out what you know information will relate someone to be a part of a specific ethnic group or something like that we're looking at some big data well we don't know how many groups we might have in our data how they might be we don't want to specify those so we just pass this information into the computer it does some of this magic stuff with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm and spits back to us a bunch of different clusters of this group and when we pass in a new data point that we haven't seen before well what it does is say okay you are a part of this cluster or you are a part of this group so unsupervised machine learning algorithms are typically used to try to figure out stuff about the data we're trying to determine different groups or different kind of pieces of information and some abstract correlations that we maybe can't see ourself as a programmer or as someone that's analyzing the information a final reminder that if you're interested in becoming an expert in data science to consider the simply learned data science masters course it's comprised of six full courses including our programming data science with Python machine learning tableau desktop qualified associate training Big Data Hadoop spark developer and data science capstone and has three electives such as IBM Watson for chatbots machine learning with our data science with sass now during this course should work on 15 plus reallife projects and learned 30 plus indemand skills with lifetime access to all of the course content this course is listed at $1,300 which is as low as 115 dollars a month and you can use the discount code data with Tim for a limited time at 10% discount I would personally recommend this course and encourage you guys to take advantage of this offer and now to talk about deep learning now deep learning is by far one of the most kind of looked up to and just like advanced parts of machine learning now a lot of people that get into machine learning just immediately jump into deep learning they see all these neural network things on YouTube they see neural network neural network neural network and they start just learning it and doing it and this was great and you can do this but deep learning is really not applicable to a lot of different tasks or maybe it is but it's way overkill and you could solve a lot of the same tasks that people are doing with deep learning and neural networks which is basic supervised machine learning algorithms or reinforcement learning are simple you know very basic things to setup and to work with so what is deep learning well I've kind of said it already but it's pretty much just working within their own networks now the reason we call this deep is because a neural network has more than one layer so whereas in our other algorithms we kind of just had an input and an output and we had a function that kind of classified or did something with that with a neural network we have layers so we have an input layer we have some hidden layers in the middle we have an output layer and our data actually gets passed through all of these different layers to pick out specific highlevel features of it now this is why neural networks are used a lot for classification tasks related to things that have patterns in them so for example doing object detection or image recognition a classic example is going to be with the amnestied data set what essentially you're hoping a neural network is gonna do when you train it on a data set like an amnesty data set which essentially is a bunch of handwritten digits and you want to figure out if there's zeros or if they're ones 2 through 9 is you're gonna pass all the pixels of this image in and then the network's actually gonna look at these pixels try to pick out like lines and features and curves and edges of it and and what the number is based on seeing all those different features that it's kind of created and and figured out so neural networks are really good at looking at higher dimensional features that you can't specifically see in the data set or that actually don't exist it will create those features for you based on the input that you're giving it but this means that it's very complicated it's very complex you don't usually understand how you're actually solving the problem when you're using a neural network because you kind of just give some input you get an output and you don't have any idea what happens in between and that's the dangerous thing when you run into an issue where your neural networks not performing correctly it's very difficult to tweak it and modify it and a lot of the times there's not much you can do because you really just don't understand what's happening in the middle so this has been kind of the four main topics in machine learning now I always like to say that I am no expert there's a lot that I still need to learn I'm a student myself and this stuff is really interesting to me and that's why I go out of my way to make videos like this and to teach other people because I want them to be able to learn the same things that I've done I find a lot of people on the internet what they do is explain things super complicated and just try to make it seem like they're very smart that's really not how I want to come off I want to explain this to you guys as simply as possible so that you can you know go out there and learn it yourself a lot of this stuff is really not that hard it's just you have to have a little bit of knowledge and know where to look to find the information so with that being said that has been the video if you guys learn something you'd like this and you want more content like this please leave a like on the video leave a comment down below and subscribe to the channel and with that being said I will see you guys
