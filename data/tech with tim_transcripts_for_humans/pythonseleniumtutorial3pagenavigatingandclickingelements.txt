00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everyone and welcome back to video
00:09 - 3 of these Python selenium tutorial
00:11 - series we're really doing in this
00:13 - shorter video is just working with page
00:15 - navigation so how can we get to specific
00:17 - pages by clicking on links how can we
00:19 - click on buttons and then how can we go
00:21 - back to the original page that we
00:23 - started on so you know I'm going back
00:24 - going forward like the back arrow the
00:26 - forward arrow how do we trigger those
00:27 - events these are pretty simple and then
00:30 - in later videos we'll get into some more
00:31 - complex stuff I think in video 5 we're
00:33 - actually gonna do the unit test
00:35 - framework where we talk about the
00:36 - classes and how to setup the actual
00:38 - automated test because this isn't really
00:40 - a test this is more of just a script
00:41 - right now so what I'm gonna do is use my
00:44 - website again to demonstrate this and
00:46 - what I want to do on the website is
00:48 - actually navigate from the home page
00:51 - let's go back there into beginner Python
00:53 - tutorials so I want to find a way where
00:55 - I can go through a bunch of different
00:56 - links so I want to click python
00:58 - programming and then after I click
01:00 - Python programming once this loads I
01:02 - want to click beginner Python
01:03 - programming and then what I actually
01:06 - want to do after I do that once this
01:08 - loads up is click on the get started
01:10 - button so essentially I want to find a
01:12 - way so we can navigate into a tutorial
01:14 - series and then a way to actually do
01:17 - what I just did so back all the way out
01:19 - so let's do that so what the first thing
01:21 - I'm gonna do is actually don't even need
01:23 - to inspect element for this beginning
01:25 - part because there's a fancy thing in
01:27 - selenium cult and I'm just gonna type it
01:29 - out here I will say link
01:31 - equals driver gets not yet find element
01:35 - by where is it link text so find element
01:40 - by link text what this does is allow us
01:43 - to type the like the text that would
01:45 - show up for a link and then actually
01:47 - access the element from that so in this
01:49 - case that link or that li item on on the
01:52 - side here let's find this so I can show
01:55 - you simply by having python programming
01:57 - here we can access this little check
01:59 - mark thing on the side and actually
02:01 - click it to move to the next page so to
02:03 - do that we say link equals driver to
02:05 - find element by link text and then we
02:07 - simply do link so I click like that so
02:11 - if we run this now for selenium
02:13 - we'll see give it a second load the main
02:16 - page and then it loads and goes to
02:18 - Python programming so that actually
02:20 - works that clicks that link now we need
02:22 - to find a way to click on this link so
02:23 - beginner Python tutorials but remember
02:26 - that when we go to a new page we need to
02:29 - make sure we're waiting for the element
02:32 - to exist before we can click on it so in
02:34 - this case it worked fine after we've
02:36 - loaded the page but sometimes the page
02:40 - loads in a weird way where we need to
02:42 - make sure that that element exists
02:43 - before we try to click it so we're gonna
02:45 - implement that same wait stuff that we
02:47 - have before I'm just gonna put that in
02:48 - there but the wait text I have it on my
02:51 - other side of my screen just so I can
02:52 - copy and some of the imports is this so
02:55 - we have from selenium-webdriver comment
02:57 - by support UI import all this so that's
03:01 - what we need and then I'm literally just
03:02 - gonna copy paste that weight code in
03:04 - again because it is kind of a handful to
03:06 - type out off the top of my head so then
03:09 - we'll have here try element equals
03:11 - webdriver driver 10 until again what
03:15 - this is doing is saying the element
03:16 - we're looking for is equal to the
03:18 - webdriver weight which means we're gonna
03:20 - wait for up to 10 seconds for the driver
03:22 - to find an element present on the page
03:24 - that has the ID of X right now in this
03:27 - case we can't have it by ID we need to
03:29 - have it by in this case gonna be the
03:31 - link text and then here we'll paste in
03:34 - the beginner Python tutorials so take
03:37 - that here paste it in and we could
03:40 - reduce this delay if we want what's
03:42 - gonna happen is say we wait more than 10
03:43 - seconds it will just timeout and it'll
03:45 - crash the program or well it would just
03:47 - quit I guess actually but that's what
03:50 - this delay is doing so we have that ec2
03:52 - presence of elements that's fine
03:54 - beginner Python tutorials then we should
03:56 - say elements dot click so we go to the
03:58 - next page and we'll make this in except
04:02 - because I actually don't want it to quit
04:03 - unless this doesn't work so let's run
04:05 - this and let's see if we get some better
04:08 - luck this time all right
04:10 - so wait waiting for it to go to the next
04:13 - page I should have picked a faster
04:15 - website for this tutorial mind it's just
04:17 - so slow sometimes and there we go
04:19 - alright so now we're here although it
04:21 - doesn't look like we pressed on the
04:23 - beginner Python tutorials oh there we go
04:26 - so they're so it actually did
04:27 - it was just taking a fair amount of time
04:28 - to get us there so it actually loads us
04:30 - in here to beginner Python tutorials I
04:32 - promise it and click that it just was
04:34 - lagging and now we have this button that
04:36 - we're gonna have to look at with ideas
04:38 - that we can click so let's zoom in here
04:41 - inspect this is a actually a so this is
04:45 - an href and how are we gonna be able to
04:47 - accesses so this has an ID s o/w button
04:50 - some random integer so let's copy that
04:53 - there we go and now I'll close this
04:56 - window cuz this is the selenium one and
04:58 - inside of here now we'll look for that
05:01 - button which is going to involve this
05:02 - same kind of wait process so let's take
05:04 - all this and let's put this here and I
05:08 - guess we can leave it called element
05:09 - that's not really gonna be a big issue
05:10 - by link text no this time it's gonna be
05:12 - by ID we're gonna copy the ID and then
05:16 - put the ID inside of here like that and
05:20 - then we'll set element dot click alright
05:24 - so let's run this I think I've done
05:26 - everything correctly and wait and see
05:29 - what happens alright so loads goes to
05:31 - the next page gives us a second alright
05:33 - it goes to the enterprise on tutorials
05:35 - hits the get started button and there we
05:37 - go now we are on this page so already I
05:39 - think that's pretty cool that we can
05:40 - navigate all the way through the pages
05:42 - like that and then obviously this is the
05:43 - introduction to my beginner Python
05:45 - programming tutorials now assuming that
05:47 - s not doesn't work but after we do that
05:50 - what we actually want to do now is go
05:52 - all the way back to the home page so
05:54 - what I can do to do that is literally
05:56 - just do driver dot back now dot back
05:59 - just goes back to the previous page it's
06:01 - actually pretty cool that we can just do
06:03 - that so I'll do that three times and now
06:07 - let's run this and let's see if we go
06:08 - all the way there and all the way back
06:09 - so give it a second this is the longest
06:12 - part of the video just waiting for the
06:13 - website to actually load so python
06:16 - programming beginner python tutorials
06:18 - alright and boom there we go we're all
06:20 - the way back at the beginning
06:21 - the reason it's much faster on the way
06:22 - back is because the page is already
06:24 - cached right so there we go so that
06:26 - works and that is kind of the basics of
06:28 - like navigating pages now there also is
06:31 - this thing driver dot forward so if I
06:34 - decide to do that like I can go back
06:35 - three and then I could go actually I
06:38 - should have done that and go driver dot
06:40 - forward
06:40 - again and go back to that original page
06:42 - so let's just do this we'll go back
06:43 - three and then forward two and I'll show
06:45 - you how that works and then I think
06:48 - there was one more thing I wanted to
06:49 - show you but for now we might be okay so
06:52 - there we go there we go go to the
06:54 - overview and then get in and back back
06:57 - back forward for it right so now we're
06:59 - back here on this get started page and
07:01 - that is the basics of how that works so
07:03 - that's to go back that's to go forward
07:05 - pretty straightforward clicking
07:08 - something is dot click you can click
07:10 - almost any element but I think it has to
07:11 - be like a link or a button or something
07:13 - that is clickable obviously and I just
07:15 - want to show you one thing that I forgot
07:17 - to say in the previous video is when
07:19 - you're accessing a text field so say
07:21 - we're accessing like the search bar
07:23 - right what we want to do before we
07:26 - access it typically is the Clery so
07:28 - there's actually a method so let's say
07:29 - that this element was the search bar
07:31 - that we found we can do element clear
07:34 - and dot clear we'll just clear all of
07:36 - the text that's already inside that
07:37 - input field to make sure that it's empty
07:40 - so when we send keys to it it will have
07:43 - those keys not appended the keys on it
07:46 - because the way that send keys actually
07:48 - works is let's say the search field
07:50 - already has hello in it and we send
07:51 - another hello
07:52 - it'll append hello it won't replace
07:54 - hello so that was just something I
07:56 - wanted to say cuz I forgot to do it last
07:58 - time yeah that's pretty much been this
07:59 - video that's how you navigate pages it's
08:01 - how you click on links I mean this is a
08:03 - technically a link but it was like
08:05 - labeled as a button it works the same
08:07 - way if it was a button you just do click
08:09 - access it by ID and that has been this
08:11 - video so if you guys enjoyed make sure
08:13 - you leave a like subscribe to the
08:14 - channel and I will see you in the next
08:15 - selenium Python tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back to video 3 of these Python selenium tutorial series we're really doing in this shorter video is just working with page navigation so how can we get to specific pages by clicking on links how can we click on buttons and then how can we go back to the original page that we started on so you know I'm going back going forward like the back arrow the forward arrow how do we trigger those events these are pretty simple and then in later videos we'll get into some more complex stuff I think in video 5 we're actually gonna do the unit test framework where we talk about the classes and how to setup the actual automated test because this isn't really a test this is more of just a script right now so what I'm gonna do is use my website again to demonstrate this and what I want to do on the website is actually navigate from the home page let's go back there into beginner Python tutorials so I want to find a way where I can go through a bunch of different links so I want to click python programming and then after I click Python programming once this loads I want to click beginner Python programming and then what I actually want to do after I do that once this loads up is click on the get started button so essentially I want to find a way so we can navigate into a tutorial series and then a way to actually do what I just did so back all the way out so let's do that so what the first thing I'm gonna do is actually don't even need to inspect element for this beginning part because there's a fancy thing in selenium cult and I'm just gonna type it out here I will say link equals driver gets not yet find element by where is it link text so find element by link text what this does is allow us to type the like the text that would show up for a link and then actually access the element from that so in this case that link or that li item on on the side here let's find this so I can show you simply by having python programming here we can access this little check mark thing on the side and actually click it to move to the next page so to do that we say link equals driver to find element by link text and then we simply do link so I click like that so if we run this now for selenium we'll see give it a second load the main page and then it loads and goes to Python programming so that actually works that clicks that link now we need to find a way to

we're gonna wait for up to 10 seconds for the driver to find an element present on the page that has the ID of X right now in this case we can't have it by ID we need to have it by in this case gonna be the link text and then here we'll paste in the beginner Python tutorials so take that here paste it in and we could reduce this delay if we want what's gonna happen is say we wait more than 10

I'll show you how that works and then I think there was one more thing I wanted to show you but for now we might be okay so there we go there we go go to the overview and then get in and back back back forward for it right so now we're back here on this get started page and that is the basics of how that works so that's to go back that's to go forward pretty straightforward clicking something
