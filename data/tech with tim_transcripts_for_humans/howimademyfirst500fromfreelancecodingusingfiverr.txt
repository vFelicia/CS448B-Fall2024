00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video
00:03 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:04 - talking to you about how i made my first
00:06 - 500 freelance coding on a website
00:10 - called fiverr now i'm making this video
00:12 - because a few months ago i made a video
00:14 - called how to make money from coding
00:16 - in that video i discussed five ways that
00:18 - you can make money from coding without
00:20 - being an expert
00:21 - without having industry experience and
00:24 - without having to work a full-time job
00:26 - now one of those methods that i talked
00:28 - about was freelancing and a lot of you
00:30 - guys had questions
00:31 - you were saying things like oh i'm not
00:32 - good enough to freelance oh there's too
00:34 - many people freelancing
00:35 - oh i don't have enough skills that are
00:36 - marketable whatever it may be you came
00:38 - up with millions of excuses
00:40 - now i'm here to show you today that it
00:42 - doesn't matter what you are good at
00:44 - if you are good at any specific coding
00:46 - technology or tool or package or module
00:49 - whatever it is you can market that skill
00:51 - and you can get people to pay you
00:52 - to do it i'm going to show you exactly
00:54 - how as i go through how i made my first
00:57 - 500 on this website so first of all
01:00 - fiverr for any of you that don't know
01:01 - is simply a freelancing website you can
01:03 - go on there you can pay people to do
01:05 - stuff for you
01:05 - and of course you can kind of market
01:07 - yourself create little ads they're
01:09 - called
01:10 - gigs and say i will do this for you and
01:12 - then people can
01:13 - pay you to do that now here i filled out
01:15 - eight orders
01:16 - on this website so i completed eight
01:18 - orders you can see you can add up all
01:20 - the totals here
01:21 - uh they add up to something around like
01:22 - 600 us dollars and i think after
01:25 - fiverr took its cut i ended up making
01:27 - something like 500 us dollars or a
01:29 - little bit over that
01:30 - but anyways i'm going to show you
01:31 - exactly what i did for these orders
01:33 - how i got these orders and how you can
01:36 - do the same thing
01:37 - so let's dive in i'll start by showing
01:38 - you the advertisement i set up on this
01:40 - website
01:41 - and talk about why i kind of formulated
01:43 - it the way that i did
01:47 - [Music]
01:52 - all right so i've got my gig here that's
01:54 - what they're called on fiverr when you
01:56 - set up these little ads or little
01:58 - descriptions of what you'll do for
01:59 - people
02:00 - and pretty much you write i will and
02:01 - then whatever it is you're gonna do so i
02:03 - said i will create a game in python
02:06 - with pygame so immediately i'm not
02:08 - making a full stack website i'm not
02:10 - doing anything super complicated
02:12 - all i was doing for this specific
02:14 - freelancing job
02:15 - was making really crappy 2d games in
02:18 - python
02:19 - using the module pygame now the reason i
02:21 - decided to do this
02:23 - was because when i was 18 i was in my
02:24 - first year of computer science
02:26 - the only thing that i was really good at
02:28 - doing was working with this module
02:29 - called pygame
02:30 - i pretty much only knew python i knew a
02:32 - few other programming languages but not
02:34 - well enough to sell my skills in them
02:36 - and i was good with this module called
02:37 - pygame which lets you make
02:39 - little crappy 2d games now the reason i
02:42 - did this was because in high school i
02:43 - was actually forced to use this module
02:45 - for a class
02:46 - so i learned how to do this and then i
02:48 - kind of fell in love with just making
02:49 - these little crappy 2d games
02:51 - well i thought there might be some
02:52 - marker for this let me put it up and let
02:54 - me see if i can make you know a few
02:55 - bucks a week
02:56 - coding out these little games i might
02:58 - already have the game done i could
02:59 - literally modify it and sell it to
03:01 - people
03:01 - anyways i'll give you an idea of what i
03:03 - did so here for my advertisement i just
03:05 - submitted some kind of
03:06 - images of the stuff that i created you
03:08 - can see this is a video of a really
03:09 - basic platformer game in uh in python in
03:12 - pi game
03:13 - and i was not making anything
03:14 - complicated anything crazy again super
03:16 - 2d
03:16 - super simple sorry 2d games this was an
03:19 - example of a mini golf
03:20 - game that i made uh this was like a
03:22 - running game like side
03:23 - scrolling kind of thing and then i had
03:25 - tetris right so basic stuff like that
03:27 - but this was enough to get people's
03:29 - attention
03:30 - then what i had was three basic packages
03:32 - so i had the small python graphical game
03:34 - that i would make for you
03:35 - i had the medium python graphical game
03:37 - and then i had the large python
03:39 - graphical game
03:40 - uh now it kind of says what the
03:41 - difference is between them the delivery
03:43 - time the revisions all of that
03:45 - source code comments all that kind of
03:47 - stuff anyways about the gig
03:49 - i'll just kind of read to you what i had
03:50 - here so need a python game
03:52 - completed for school definitely not
03:54 - marketing to finish people's projects
03:57 - i will create a smooth good-looking 2d
03:59 - game for you with python and pie game i
04:01 - have a ton of experience with python and
04:02 - pie game and make games all the time
04:04 - and then i kind of listed some stuff
04:05 - here of what i would do notice i also
04:07 - said i can adjust the price
04:09 - and almost every single person messaged
04:11 - me for a game ended up paying less than
04:13 - i was charging in these packages so they
04:15 - would try to kind of bargain me down
04:17 - and usually i would just give in and say
04:18 - sure you know what i'll do a few for 30
04:19 - bucks or whatever it may be
04:21 - you can see i this is my seller rating
04:23 - or kind of profile on fiverr i'm from
04:25 - canada i was a
04:26 - member since november 2018. the last
04:29 - delivery i did was a year ago i don't
04:30 - freelance anymore and my average
04:32 - response time was an hour add a little
04:33 - description
04:34 - i'll leave this in the link in the
04:35 - description so you guys can check it out
04:37 - if you want to read through everything
04:38 - and then here are the packages right so
04:40 - delivery time you could pay more to have
04:41 - it delivered in less time
04:43 - and all this stuff is like default on
04:45 - fiverr like super simple i didn't have
04:46 - to code any of this out like you just
04:48 - fill in all this information and it
04:50 - makes this page for you
04:52 - anyways i have eight reviews from all
04:54 - the people that i did
04:55 - the uh the projects for or whatever it
04:57 - was that they were asking for
04:59 - and while i was five-star rated and
05:00 - obviously that's helpful people look for
05:02 - high ratings on sites like these
05:04 - so anyways that was the ad this is what
05:06 - i set up and literally this got
05:08 - like hundreds of views a month because i
05:10 - was one of the only people on fiverr
05:13 - that was actually making stuff
05:14 - with pygame now i'm sure after this
05:16 - video this probably isn't going to be
05:18 - the best thing that you guys could do to
05:19 - make money
05:20 - but my point is that if you pick
05:21 - something extremely specific
05:23 - and something that has a small market
05:25 - but a market where like you're the only
05:27 - person supplying something in it
05:29 - then you immediately are going to be a
05:32 - scene right people are going to find
05:33 - your stuff because there's no one else
05:34 - that's doing what you're doing
05:36 - and even today i mean we could probably
05:37 - look this up and check but i don't think
05:39 - there's many people
05:40 - that are making little crappy 2d games
05:42 - in python with the module pi game and
05:44 - well it turns out that people need
05:45 - that done so anyways that was the ad
05:48 - this is what i was doing for people
05:49 - let me now show you what i actually made
05:52 - because you're going to be surprised by
05:53 - how simple these games are
05:54 - and how much i got paid to actually
05:56 - create them alright so just as a
05:57 - refresher
05:58 - these are the orders right here i will
06:00 - try to specify how much i got paid for
06:02 - the projects that i show you i'm not
06:04 - going to show you all of them but i'll
06:05 - just show you a few examples
06:06 - to give you an idea of kind of what
06:08 - people were looking for and how simple
06:10 - these projects really were
06:11 - so anyways all of them were completed
06:13 - all of them were rated five stars and
06:14 - again like the most expensive one i did
06:16 - was 200
06:17 - i'll show you that one but even that one
06:18 - was only like 800 lines of code probably
06:21 - took me like four or five hours to
06:22 - program it
06:23 - so we'll close this up let me head into
06:25 - vs code and then i'll be right back
06:27 - all right so i'm here in vs code i'm
06:28 - just going to show you a few examples of
06:30 - the projects that i made and how much i
06:31 - got paid for each of these
06:33 - uh so the first one that i'm actually
06:34 - going to show you is called ui or that's
06:36 - like what the folder is called that i
06:38 - submitted i just downloaded all of the
06:39 - deliverables that i actually gave to the
06:41 - people
06:42 - so i could show you in this video but
06:44 - this is a really basic
06:46 - user interface in pygame and i remember
06:48 - that what this guy wanted for this
06:50 - specific project was he needed something
06:52 - that he could run on his raspberry pi
06:54 - uh that he would be able to use to grab
06:56 - a user's phone number so he just wanted
06:57 - some like nice looking ui that had some
06:59 - buttons and like an input field
07:01 - and that's literally all this guy wanted
07:02 - so let me go into ui
07:05 - and let's run this code all right so we
07:07 - run this you can see this is what i
07:09 - created this guy paid me 75 bucks to do
07:11 - this
07:12 - and while all you need to do is
07:13 - literally you know type in your phone
07:15 - number whatever it may be
07:16 - you can obviously type more digits than
07:18 - is a valid phone number he didn't ask
07:20 - for that so i didn't implement it
07:22 - you can clear digits like that you can
07:24 - add the pound sign the star sign and
07:26 - when you press ok
07:27 - boom it prints out the phone number
07:28 - right there that was literally all he
07:30 - wanted i don't know what he was using it
07:32 - for but i remember clearly it was like
07:33 - something to do with his raspberry pi
07:35 - anyways 75 bucks for that looking
07:37 - through the code it's literally what 180
07:40 - lines
07:40 - it's really basic i didn't use anything
07:42 - in advance this took me under an hour to
07:44 - make i remember it because i was like
07:46 - pumped that he was going to pay me so
07:47 - much for literally such a simple project
07:49 - anyways closing that one let's move on
07:52 - to another one let's go to tic-tac-toe
07:54 - i think this one is pretty
07:55 - straightforward this one wasn't even pie
07:56 - game so this guy saw
07:58 - that i made like 2d games in pie game
08:00 - and he still messaged me and said hey
08:01 - can you make me tic-tac-toe
08:03 - it needs to be like two-player or like
08:05 - something like that
08:06 - he had a bunch of requirements anyways i
08:09 - made him tic-tac-toe this isn't even in
08:11 - pi game it's like 300 something lines
08:13 - probably took me a few hours to do and
08:15 - i'll look for the price after but i
08:16 - think this was probably again like 75
08:18 - bucks or something like that
08:19 - uh but this is actually running in the
08:21 - console because it's not pi games let's
08:23 - zoom in here
08:24 - it says type s for single player and m
08:26 - for multiplayer and v
08:28 - to view the top high score so let's look
08:29 - at v no high scores to display okay
08:32 - do you want to play again yes type s for
08:34 - single player m for multiplayer
08:36 - let's go s enter the player's name tim
08:39 - you can see we have this little board
08:41 - let's put a 1 in there and there we go
08:43 - now we have an x the computer makes its
08:45 - move
08:45 - there's an o there okay let's put in a 2
08:48 - or let's take the center square maybe so
08:50 - we'll do go with the 5.
08:51 - there he actually blocks us so now we're
08:53 - gonna have to block him that is in
08:55 - square eight okay decides to go up there
08:58 - to block us and i mean we can keep
08:59 - playing and so on
09:00 - you get the idea it's just basic
09:02 - tic-tac-toe this works with single
09:04 - player and multiplayer and well
09:05 - that's what i made now i'm going to say
09:08 - that i got paid 75 bucks for that
09:09 - although let me look on the thing
09:11 - because i don't remember
09:12 - yeah i think it was 75 i'm pretty sure
09:14 - it was this guy right here who paid me
09:16 - for
09:17 - anyways that's that project let me show
09:19 - you another one so this one
09:20 - was actually the most advanced one that
09:22 - i did this one definitely took the most
09:24 - amount of time probably like four or
09:25 - five
09:25 - hours uh and this was uh what was this
09:28 - this was
09:29 - tetris so this one i got paid 200 to do
09:32 - i'm just gonna cd into the folder here
09:34 - so i can do it
09:36 - and let's run this bat file so dot slash
09:39 - run dot bat okay uh let's just have a
09:42 - look at this so this is tetris
09:44 - you can play single player two player
09:46 - single player versus ai
09:47 - i'll show you the ai even though the ai
09:49 - was like not really an ai it was just
09:51 - like somewhat random
09:52 - so let's go three and you can see that
09:54 - we just have tetris
09:56 - i'm on the left hand side as the player
09:58 - and then player two is actually the
09:59 - computer and you can see it's kind of
10:01 - automatically moving i'm not doing any
10:02 - movements with my other hand
10:04 - but anyways this is the idea this is
10:05 - just basic tetris i'm just going to
10:07 - intentionally lose so i can show you the
10:09 - other version
10:10 - but this i remember clearly like not
10:11 - taking me more than a day to finish and
10:13 - getting paid 200 us dollars to do that
10:15 - so not bad whatsoever
10:17 - and this was definitely like the
10:18 - cleanest project that i did it worked
10:20 - the best but obviously i got paid the
10:22 - most amount for it
10:23 - so anyways the point of this video was
10:24 - just to show you that you can make money
10:27 - freelancing
10:28 - to give you kind of an idea of how to do
10:29 - that to give you some like concrete
10:31 - steps or points
10:33 - the first thing you want to do is you
10:34 - need to pick something that you're going
10:35 - to do
10:36 - that's super specific that's pretty easy
10:38 - for you to do that you're decent at
10:40 - and that not many people are doing right
10:42 - if you're not an expert freelancer if
10:44 - you can't build out full stack websites
10:46 - you need to make yourself attractive in
10:48 - a different way that you're cheap
10:50 - that you you know work well with people
10:52 - you have a high rating and you're doing
10:53 - something that
10:54 - not many other people are even willing
10:56 - to do on the freelancing site
10:58 - like creating crappy 2d games in python
11:00 - with the module called
11:02 - pygame so anyways if you guys have any
11:03 - questions please do leave them down
11:05 - below i will leave a link to this gig
11:07 - if you want to take a look at it for
11:09 - yourself but i hope this video was
11:10 - helpful i hope maybe it gave you guys
11:12 - some motivation to start trying to
11:14 - freelance
11:14 - i will tell you that this stuff does not
11:16 - happen overnight
11:17 - sometimes it takes you know weeks or
11:19 - months for someone to reach out to you
11:21 - to get a project but if you're just
11:22 - looking to make some quick side money
11:24 - there's no harm in putting up a little
11:26 - advertisement like this
11:27 - seeing if it gets any traction if it
11:29 - does you know being able to make a quick
11:30 - 50 bucks
11:31 - or like me your first 500 freelancing so
11:34 - i hope this was helpful if it was make
11:35 - sure you leave a like
11:36 - subscribe to the channel down below and
11:38 - i will see you guys in another youtube
11:40 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be talking to you about how i made my first 500 freelance coding on a website called fiverr now i'm making this video because a few months ago i made a video called how to make money from coding in that video i discussed five ways that you can make money from coding without being an expert without having industry experience and without having to work a fulltime job now one of those methods that i talked about was freelancing and a lot of you guys had questions you were saying things like oh i'm not good enough to freelance oh there's too many people freelancing oh i don't have enough skills that are marketable whatever it may be you came up with millions of excuses now i'm here to show you today that it doesn't matter what you are good at if you are good at any specific coding technology or tool or package or module whatever it is you can market that skill and you can get people to pay you to do it i'm going to show you exactly how as i go through how i made my first 500 on this website so first of all fiverr for any of you that don't know is simply a freelancing website you can go on there you can pay people to do stuff for you and of course you can kind of market yourself create little ads they're called gigs and say i will do this for you and then people can pay you to do that now here i filled out eight orders on this website so i completed eight orders you can see you can add up all the totals here uh they add up to something around like 600 us dollars and i think after fiverr took its cut i ended up making something like 500 us dollars or a little bit over that but anyways i'm going to show you exactly what i did for these orders how i got these orders and how you can do the same thing so let's dive in i'll start by showing you the advertisement i set up on this website and talk about why i kind of formulated it the way that i did all right so i've got my gig here that's what they're called on fiverr when you set up these little ads or little descriptions of what you'll do for people and pretty much you write i will and then whatever it is you're gonna do so i said i will create a game in python with pygame so immediately i'm not making a full stack website i'm not doing anything super complicated all i was doing for this specific freelancing job was making really crappy 2d games in python using the module pygame now the reason i decided to do this was because when i was 18 i was in my first year of computer science the only thing that i was

description so you guys can check it out if you want to read through everything and then here are the packages right so delivery time you could pay more to have it delivered in less time and all this stuff is like default on fiverr like super simple i didn't have to code any of this out like you just fill in all this information and it makes this page for you anyways i have eight reviews from all the people that i did the uh the projects for or whatever it was that they were asking for and while i was fivestar rated and obviously that's helpful people look for high ratings on sites like these so anyways that was the ad this is what i set up and literally this got like hundreds of views a month because i was one of the only people on fiverr that was actually making stuff with pygame now i'm sure after this video this probably isn't going to be the best thing that you guys could do to make money but my point is that if you pick something extremely specific and something that has a small market but a market where like you're the only person supplying something in it then you immediately are going to be a scene right people are going to find your stuff because there's no one else that's doing what you're doing and even today i mean we could probably look this up and check but i don't think there's many people that are making little crappy 2d games in python with the module pi game and well it turns out that people need that done so anyways that was the ad this is what i was doing for people let me now show you what i actually made because you're going to be surprised by how simple these games are and how much i got paid to actually create them alright so just as a refresher these are the orders right here i will try to specify how much i got paid for the projects that i show you i'm not going to show you all of them but i'll just show you a few examples to give you an idea of kind of what people were looking for and how simple these projects really were so anyways all of them were completed all of them were rated five stars and again like the most expensive one i did was 200 i'll show you that one but even that one was only like 800 lines of code probably took me like four or five hours to program it so we'll close this up let me head into vs code and then i'll be right back all right so i'm here in vs code i'm just going to show you a few examples of the projects that i made and how much i got paid for each of these uh so the first one that i'm actually going to show you is called ui or that's like what the folder is called that i submitted i just downloaded all of the deliverables that i actually gave to the people so i could show you in this video but this is a really basic user interface in pygame and i remember that what this guy wanted for this specific project was he needed something that he could run on his raspberry pi uh that he would be able to use to grab a user's phone number so he just wanted some like nice looking ui that had some buttons and like an input field and that's literally all this guy wanted so let me go into ui and let's run this code all right so we run this you can see this is what i created this guy paid me 75 bucks to do this and while all you need to do is literally you know type in your phone number whatever it may be you can obviously type more digits than is a valid phone number he didn't ask for that so i didn't implement it you can clear digits like that you can add the pound sign the star sign and when you press ok boom it prints out the phone number right there that was literally all he wanted i don't know what he was using it for but i remember clearly it was like something to do with his raspberry pi anyways 75 bucks for that looking through the code it's literally what 180 lines it's really basic i didn't use anything in advance this took me under an hour to make i remember it because i was like pumped that he was going to pay me so much for literally such a simple project anyways closing that one let's move on to another one let's go to tictactoe i think this one is pretty straightforward this one wasn't even pie game so this guy saw that i made like 2d games in pie game and he still messaged me and said hey can you make me tictactoe it needs to be like twoplayer or like something like that he had a bunch of requirements anyways i made him tictactoe this isn't even in pi game it's like 300 something lines probably took me a few hours to do and i'll look for the price after but i think this was probably again like 75 bucks or something like that uh but this is actually running in the console because it's not pi games let's zoom in here it says type s for single player and m for multiplayer and v to view the top high score so let's look at v no high scores to display okay do you want to play again yes type s for single player m for multiplayer let's go s enter the player's name tim you can see we have this little board let's put a 1 in there and there we go now we have an x the computer makes its move there's an o there okay let's put in a 2 or let's take the center square maybe so we'll do go with the 5. there he actually blocks us so now we're gonna have to block him that is in square eight okay decides to go up there to block us and i mean we can keep playing and so on you get the idea it's just basic tictactoe this works with single player and multiplayer and well that's what i made now i'm going to say that i got paid 75 bucks for that although let me look on the thing because i don't remember yeah i think it was 75 i'm pretty sure it was this guy right here who paid me for anyways that's that project let me show you another one so this one was actually the most advanced one that i did this one definitely took the most amount of time probably like four or five hours uh and this was uh what was this this was tetris so this one i got paid 200 to do i'm just gonna cd into the folder here so i can do it and let's run this bat file so dot slash run dot bat okay uh let's just have a look at this so this is tetris you can play single player two player single player versus ai i'll show you the ai even though the ai was like not really an ai it was just like somewhat random so let's go three and you can see that we just have tetris i'm on the left hand side as the player and then player two is actually the computer and you can see it's kind of automatically moving i'm not doing any movements with my other hand but anyways this is the idea this is just basic tetris i'm just going to intentionally lose so i can show you the other version but this i remember clearly like not taking me more than a day to finish and getting paid 200 us dollars to do that so not bad whatsoever and this was definitely like the cleanest project that i did it worked the best but obviously i got paid the most amount for it so anyways the point of this video was just to show you that you can make money freelancing to give you kind of an idea of how to do that to give you some like concrete steps or points the first thing you want to do is you need to pick something that you're going to do that's super specific that's pretty easy for you to do that you're decent at and that not many people are doing right if you're not an expert freelancer if you can't build out full stack websites you need to make yourself attractive in a different way that you're cheap that you you know work well with people you have a high rating and you're doing something that not many other people are even willing to do on the freelancing site like creating crappy 2d games in python with the module called pygame so anyways if you guys have any questions please do leave them down below i will leave a link to this gig if you want to take a look at it for yourself but i hope this video was helpful i hope maybe it gave you guys some motivation to start trying to freelance i will tell you that this stuff does not happen overnight sometimes it takes you know weeks or months for someone to reach out to you to get a project but if you're just looking to make some quick side money there's no harm in putting up a little advertisement like this seeing if it gets any traction if it does you know being able to make a quick 50 bucks or like me your first 500 freelancing so i hope this was helpful if it was make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel down below and i will see you guys in another youtube video
