00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna be giving you a pc component
00:15 - overview slash guide where i kind of
00:17 - walk you through the main components in
00:19 - a computer discuss what their purpose is
00:22 - how they work with the other components
00:24 - and then what you should look for when
00:25 - you're actually purchasing these
00:26 - components so whether you're buying a pc
00:29 - building a pc maybe purchasing a laptop
00:31 - it's really helpful to understand what
00:33 - each component is what the role is in
00:36 - the machine and what's actually going to
00:37 - make a difference in terms of your
00:38 - performance and day-to-day use of the
00:40 - computer so that's the goal of this
00:42 - video let's go ahead and get into it

01:45 - again to altium designer for sponsoring
01:46 - this video and now let's dive in alright
01:49 - so let me begin by just walking you
01:50 - through the main components that every
01:52 - computer is going to have so in every pc
01:55 - every laptop doesn't matter what type of
01:57 - computer you have you're going to have a
01:59 - motherboard you're going to have a cpu
02:01 - that's your central processing unit
02:03 - you're going to have a ram which is
02:04 - random access memory you're going to
02:06 - have a graphics processing unit this may
02:08 - be a dedicated gpu so graphics
02:10 - processing unit or it may be integrated
02:12 - with your cpu you're then going to have
02:14 - some type of storage device so a hard
02:16 - drive or an ssd and then i just want to
02:19 - note here that any peripherals of things
02:20 - like a microphone a mouse a keyboard a
02:23 - monitor those are not a part of the
02:25 - actual computer those are things that
02:27 - are going to plug into the input or
02:28 - output devices of your motherboard and
02:31 - allow you to actually view what's
02:32 - happening on the computer so i just want
02:34 - to make that clear something like your
02:36 - monitor or your screen even if it's on a
02:38 - laptop that's not really a part of the
02:40 - actual computer the computer is simply
02:42 - the components that i just listed there
02:44 - may be a few other things depending on
02:45 - the build that you have but those are
02:47 - the main and kind of fundamental ones so
02:49 - with that said let's start going through
02:50 - each component i'll talk about the
02:52 - importance of them and which ones you
02:54 - really want to look out for when you're
02:55 - actually buying a computer and which
02:57 - ones are going to make the biggest
02:58 - difference for your day-to-day usage
03:00 - alright so let's begin with arguably one
03:02 - of the most important components which
03:03 - is the cpu now the cpu is the central
03:06 - processing unit and a lot of people like
03:08 - to think of this as the brains of the
03:10 - computer this is one of the most
03:12 - important parts it's speed is really
03:14 - going to dictate how fast your computer
03:16 - is and it's going to be responsible for
03:18 - doing all of the arithmetic all of the
03:20 - math and pretty much all of the heavy
03:22 - lifting of the computer now it's going
03:24 - to utilize all of the other components
03:26 - and it needs those other components to
03:27 - work properly but it is kind of the
03:29 - heart of the pc or the heart of the
03:31 - computer and with a poor cpu it doesn't
03:33 - matter what other components you have
03:35 - your computer is going to be slow so in
03:37 - terms of looking out for different cpus
03:39 - and kind of the properties of cpus
03:41 - you're going to have two main brands
03:43 - that you're going to be going to when
03:44 - you're purchasing a cpu or even
03:46 - purchasing a pre-built computer that
03:47 - comes with the cpu now that's going to
03:49 - be amd and intel now recently amd has
03:52 - been outperforming intel when it comes
03:54 - to value for cpus so personally i
03:57 - recommend amd cpus however intel does
03:59 - still have a large market share and tons
04:01 - of computers come with intel cpus it
04:04 - doesn't really matter if you have an
04:05 - intel vs amd cpu some are better at
04:08 - specific tasks but what you really want
04:10 - to look for when you're looking at a cpu
04:12 - is the specs of the cpu so the number of
04:15 - cores the speed of those cores and then
04:17 - the number of threads as well now when
04:19 - you're looking at a cpu i would say the
04:21 - minimum amount of cores that you really
04:23 - want to go with in 2021 is four now
04:25 - there is a lot of cpus that are dual
04:27 - core cpus you're going to see these in
04:29 - very entry-level machines very basic
04:31 - computers maybe even in things like
04:33 - phones now dual core cpus are fine if
04:35 - you're only doing something like web
04:37 - browsing or word processing but if you
04:39 - want to play any type of video game if
04:41 - you want to load multiple applications
04:42 - at the same time if you want a
04:44 - relatively snappy feel to your pc you're
04:47 - really going to want to go with at least
04:48 - four cores now when you're looking at
04:50 - cores you're probably also going to see
04:52 - something that says threats now
04:53 - typically the number of threads is going
04:55 - to be double the number of cores i don't
04:57 - want to get into that because this is
04:58 - kind of a video for beginners but
05:00 - essentially you don't really need to
05:01 - worry about the threads just look at the
05:03 - cores almost all modern cpus have
05:05 - something called hyper threading which
05:07 - kind of allows each core to perform
05:09 - multiple operations at a time that's why
05:11 - you'll see something like multiple
05:13 - threads or more threads than the number
05:14 - of cores
05:15 - now other than that you're going to see
05:17 - a speed for the core so if you see
05:19 - something like 3.8 gigahertz 4.2
05:22 - gigahertz and then you'll see things
05:24 - like turbo clock boost clock all of
05:26 - these kind of marketing things you'll
05:27 - see on cpus right the speed of the cpu
05:30 - is very important but one thing to note
05:31 - is that just because a cpu has a higher
05:33 - speed does not mean that it's going to
05:35 - outperform one with a lower speed for
05:38 - example if i have a cpu that has six
05:40 - cores and you have one that has two
05:42 - cores but your cores are clocked at four
05:44 - gigahertz that's the speed of your cpu
05:46 - my cpu even if it's clocked at say 2.5
05:49 - gigahertz is gonna outperform your cpu
05:51 - in almost every single task that core
05:54 - speed that you're seeing there is the
05:55 - speed of a single core so you can kind
05:58 - of multiply the speed by the number of
06:00 - cores and that will relatively tell you
06:02 - how quick the cpu is going to be now
06:04 - this is not a precise calculation and in
06:06 - some situations you do actually want a
06:08 - higher clock speed than the number of
06:10 - cores especially if you're running
06:12 - single threaded applications i'm not
06:13 - going to get into that again because
06:15 - this is for beginners but the idea is
06:17 - for most common people you're going to
06:19 - favor more cores over a higher clock
06:21 - speed and most modern cpus are going to
06:23 - be clocked at least 3 gigahertz which is
06:25 - going to be more than fast enough for
06:26 - you to have a very responsive and kind
06:28 - of fast experience using the computer
06:30 - alright so now let's talk about ram
06:32 - which is random access memory now ram is
06:34 - a temporary storage location now this
06:37 - means if you turn off your cpu anything
06:39 - in ram is going to disappear it's going
06:41 - to be gone now the point of ram is to
06:43 - store data that needs to be readily
06:45 - available to the cpu or the computer so
06:47 - it can very quickly be accessed and very
06:50 - quickly be changed so any programs that
06:52 - you're running on your computer will
06:53 - utilize a small amount of ram or if
06:55 - you're talking about something like
06:56 - google chrome a large amount of ram
06:58 - because they're going to be storing all
06:59 - of their program data in ram so it's
07:02 - very quick to access now this is in
07:04 - contrast to something like an ssd or a
07:06 - hard drive which is going to be a much
07:07 - slower storage medium but is going to be
07:09 - persistent meaning when you turn off the
07:11 - computer the data on there is going to
07:13 - stay it's not going to be deleted
07:15 - anyways let's talk about what you want
07:16 - to look for when you're looking for ram
07:18 - so ram has many different forums you
07:20 - have ddr2 ddr3 and ddr4 and one very
07:23 - important thing to note is that laptop
07:25 - ram is different than desktop ram so you
07:28 - cannot put laptop ram in your desktop
07:30 - that's not going to work so just keep
07:32 - that in mind i've know many people who
07:34 - have accidentally bought the wrong type
07:35 - of rep anyways the main kind of i guess
07:38 - types or generations of ram that we have
07:40 - right now is ddr3 and ddr4 now ddr3 is a
07:44 - much older style of ram that's probably
07:46 - a red flag if you're buying a computer
07:47 - if it has ddr3 you're gonna perfor
07:50 - prefer ddr4 sorry which has a much
07:52 - higher kind of stock speed now when
07:55 - we're looking at ram we have all kinds
07:56 - of speeds anywhere from something like
07:58 - two six six six megahertz uh to
08:00 - something like 3200 megahertz or 3600
08:03 - megahertz now the ram speed doesn't
08:06 - matter a ton for most of you but if you
08:08 - are building your own computer then you
08:09 - want to go with a higher ram speed
08:11 - rather than a lower ram speed now
08:13 - ideally the sweet spot is probably going
08:15 - to be around 32 to 3 400 megahertz for
08:18 - your ram but for most of you you're not
08:20 - gonna have that option and you're not
08:21 - even gonna see that speed if you're
08:22 - buying a pre-built computer so in terms
08:24 - of the amount of ram for most of you
08:26 - you're going to want either 8 or 16
08:28 - gigabytes of ram now you could get 4
08:29 - gigabytes of ram if you're going with a
08:31 - very entry-level computer but just keep
08:33 - in mind that this is going to be an
08:35 - entry-level computer it's going to be
08:36 - slow it's not going to be the most
08:37 - performant so i would recommend as a
08:39 - minimum for most people unless you're
08:41 - really on a budget eight gigabytes of
08:43 - rent now 16 gigabytes is going to be the
08:45 - sweet spot this is a really nice middle
08:47 - ground you almost never need more than
08:49 - 16 gigabytes and again for most of you
08:51 - you're going to want that amount now
08:52 - some of you may be saying well can't i
08:54 - get 17 gigabytes the answer is no you
08:56 - need to have a certain denomination of
08:58 - ram it's gonna be a power of two so
09:00 - either two gigabytes four gigabytes
09:02 - eight sixteen thirty two sixty four one
09:04 - twenty eight that's just how ram works
09:06 - you'll see some weird computers that
09:08 - have like six gigabytes of ram don't
09:09 - worry about that that's kind of an
09:11 - exception to what i'm saying for most of
09:12 - you again you're gonna want either eight
09:14 - or 16 gigs now if you are doing anything
09:17 - that is going to require more ram you
09:19 - have a really high end cpu you're doing
09:21 - video editing maybe you're rendering a
09:22 - bunch of stuff then you may want to
09:24 - consider going up to 32 gigabytes of ram
09:27 - and if you're doing machine learning ai
09:29 - a ton of data processing and you need
09:30 - that loaded for your models you probably
09:33 - might want to go up to 64. now in my
09:35 - personal computer i have 64 gigabytes of
09:37 - ram i have never needed to use that
09:39 - amount the most i've probably ever used
09:40 - to be like 32 gigs and even that again
09:44 - like 32 gigs would be completely fine
09:45 - for my computer now one kind of random
09:48 - rule of thumb here that i'm going to
09:49 - throw in is that if you have a very high
09:51 - end gpu so something like a 30 90 a 3080
09:53 - a titan then you're going to want to
09:55 - have double the amount of ram than your
09:57 - video memory now i'm going to talk about
09:59 - video memory in a second but if you have
10:01 - 24 gigabytes of vram you're going to
10:02 - want at least 48 gigabytes of ram which
10:05 - means you should probably go to 64. i
10:06 - won't talk about all the reasons for
10:08 - that but just keep that in mind in case
10:09 - you're getting a very high-end gpu so
10:11 - now let's move on to motherboard now the
10:13 - motherboard is going to be the bridge or
10:14 - the connection between all your
10:16 - different pc components so your graphics
10:18 - card your cpu your ram all of that is
10:21 - going to go directly on the motherboard
10:23 - and the way they're going to communicate
10:24 - is through the bus on the motherboard
10:26 - now the motherboard is also going to
10:27 - deliver power to the components unless
10:30 - the components have a their own separate
10:32 - kind of power connection
10:34 - anyways the motherboard is important but
10:35 - for most of you you're not going to have
10:37 - to pick it out or even look at the specs
10:39 - because it's just going to come with
10:40 - whatever computer you buy if you are
10:42 - building your own computer do some
10:44 - research i'm not going to talk about a
10:45 - ton in this video it is very important
10:47 - that you pick a motherboard that's
10:48 - compatible with your cpu your amount of
10:50 - ram and all of the expansion cards you
10:53 - may want to add and other features like
10:54 - fan headers uh and like extra usb ports
10:57 - and stuff like that now your motherboard
10:59 - will also have the input and output
11:01 - devices so it will have usb ports on it
11:03 - it will have audio jacks it might have
11:05 - an hdmi or vga port if you have an
11:07 - integrated graphics card
11:09 - all of this type of stuff uh anyways
11:11 - that's pretty much it for motherboard
11:12 - again not super important don't worry
11:14 - about it unless you are building your
11:16 - own computer in which case do some
11:18 - research all right so let's go to gpu
11:20 - which is graphics processing unit now
11:22 - this is very important if you are doing
11:24 - anything graphics intensive like 3d
11:26 - rendering
11:27 - video editing playing video games if
11:29 - that's the case you're going to want to
11:31 - get something known as a dedicated gpu
11:33 - however if you are not doing any of that
11:35 - then you can get an integrated gpu now
11:38 - an integrated gpu is built into the cpu
11:40 - which means you don't have to buy a
11:42 - separate component it's just already
11:44 - there now you do require either an
11:46 - integrated or a dedicated gpu to get a
11:49 - display output and the reason i'm saying
11:51 - that is because some cpus do not come
11:53 - with integrated graphics so most amd
11:56 - cpus do not have integrated graphics
11:58 - meaning you actually need a graphics
11:59 - card to get some output from the
12:01 - computer however most intel cpus do
12:04 - which means that you can just directly
12:05 - plug in a cable to the motherboard and
12:07 - you'll be able to actually see something
12:09 - on your monitor
12:10 - okay hopefully that makes sense now i
12:12 - don't want to go through all the
12:12 - different gpu models because there's so
12:14 - many and there's a lot of great reviews
12:16 - out there from people other than me but
12:18 - when you are buying a computer the first
12:19 - thing you want to consider is do i need
12:21 - a gpu or do i not need a gpu then you're
12:24 - gonna look at the different levels of
12:25 - gpus and depending on what you're doing
12:27 - and the specs of your other components
12:29 - you're gonna pick a gpu now you want
12:31 - your gpu to be balanced with your cpu
12:34 - amount of ram and all of that type of
12:36 - stuff don't go buy a 39 d if you have a
12:39 - 4 core cpu that's unnecessary and you're
12:41 - going to bottleneck this crazy gpu with
12:44 - a very poor cpu relative to the
12:46 - performance of the gpu alright so i was
12:48 - just editing this video and i realized i
12:49 - missed some important details in the gpu
12:51 - section so i just wanted to kind of fill
12:53 - those in here now i don't want to give
12:54 - you a treat though if you've stuck
12:56 - around until this point in the video and
12:58 - i'm going to show you that this is my
12:59 - cat this is fresca she's hanging out on
13:01 - the desk right here she's like always on
13:04 - my desk when i'm working which is nice
13:05 - but also quite annoying if i'm trying to
13:07 - type or something like that anyways i
13:08 - just wanted to introduce her in case you
13:10 - guys haven't seen her kind of walking
13:11 - around on the desk in my videos
13:14 - regardless let's now get into those
13:15 - missing details so gpus when you're
13:18 - looking at a dedicated gpu that's kind
13:19 - of what i'm going to be talking about
13:21 - now you're going to have two companies
13:22 - that are going to be providing the gpus
13:24 - amd and nvidia now nvidia is kind of the
13:27 - preferred company for gpus that's the
13:30 - one i personally recommend just because
13:32 - they're more mainstream they have like
13:34 - larger market share and uh their drivers
13:36 - and all these things are more compatible
13:38 - with more stuff they have some other
13:39 - cool features like nvidia broadcast
13:42 - which you can only get access to if you
13:43 - have specific uh series gpus from nvidia
13:47 - now also if i'm mispronouncing that let
13:49 - me know in the comments because i never
13:50 - know how to pronounce that company name
13:52 - anyways let's continue
13:54 - all right so amd totally fine if you get
13:56 - an amd gpu that's all right in fact most
13:58 - mac computers are going to come with an
14:00 - amd gpu and that's because i think they
14:02 - have some special like proprietary
14:04 - partnership regardless those are fine
14:06 - now when you're looking at the specs of
14:08 - a gpu the first thing you're going to
14:10 - want to look at is the generation of the
14:11 - gpu so is it first gen second gen third
14:14 - gen is it a 20 series is a 30 series you
14:16 - just want to look at how recent it is
14:18 - and obviously you're going to want to go
14:19 - for the most recent gpu that you can now
14:22 - other than that you're going to want to
14:23 - look at the amount of video memory now
14:26 - video memory otherwise known as vram is
14:28 - special dedicated memory very similar to
14:30 - regular ram but just for the graphics
14:33 - card now the graphics card is actually
14:35 - going to be responsible for rendering
14:37 - all of your frames so if you're playing
14:38 - a video game your video memory is going
14:40 - to act as a video buffer and what that
14:43 - means is you're going to have all of
14:44 - your frames and everything that you're
14:46 - going to be seeing kind of being stored
14:47 - in the vram first and then being passed
14:50 - to the display output where you'll
14:52 - actually see it on the screen now again
14:54 - take all this with a grain of salt it's
14:55 - just an over simplification to give you
14:57 - a general kind of explanation of what's
14:59 - going on but essentially the more video
15:01 - memory the better now as i said before
15:04 - you want to have double the ram of your
15:05 - video memory so if you have an 8 gig
15:08 - video memory card you want 16 gigabytes
15:10 - of ram this is just so you can load uh
15:13 - the vram of the gpu fast enough if you
15:15 - don't have enough ram then it's going to
15:17 - go slower it's not going to load as fast
15:19 - as it possibly can
15:20 - okay so in terms of the amount of vram
15:23 - you want the minimum you're probably
15:25 - gonna get is four now in some gpus there
15:27 - will be two gigabytes of ram that's
15:29 - pretty unnecessary at that point you
15:30 - don't even really need a dedicated gpu
15:33 - but in any gpu that is actually gonna do
15:35 - anything meaningful for you it's
15:36 - probably gonna have four gigabytes of
15:38 - ram now four gigabytes is nice to have
15:40 - if you're not going to be doing any
15:41 - super high res gaming or high settings
15:43 - gaming maybe you just want to do a
15:45 - little light video editing you want like
15:47 - some graphics power that's where you
15:48 - would go with four gigabytes but the
15:50 - sweet spot is gonna be six eight or 12
15:53 - gigabytes now for most people you're
15:54 - gonna be getting a card that has six or
15:56 - eight gigabytes in it as soon as you
15:58 - start going up to 12 or 24 gigabytes
16:00 - you're getting into the really expensive
16:02 - high-end graphics cards and at that
16:04 - point i probably don't need to tell you
16:05 - what to buy you probably already know
16:06 - what you're looking for anyways those
16:08 - are kind of the details i wanted to add
16:10 - in again i would prefer an nvidia gpu
16:12 - especially if you're gonna be gaming
16:14 - however if you're just doing some light
16:15 - video editing you could definitely go
16:17 - with the lower end gpu like an amd gpu
16:20 - that has four gigabytes of video memory
16:22 - now it's also very important again to
16:23 - look at the generation the older gen the
16:26 - gpu obviously the worse it's going to
16:28 - perform and the less features it's going
16:29 - to have the new high-end gpus have a ton
16:32 - of awesome features that most modern
16:34 - games will take advantage of say like
16:36 - ray tracing if you go with say a 10
16:37 - series nvidia gpu you're not gonna have
16:40 - those features so keep that in mind you
16:41 - definitely need to do more research on
16:43 - this before you buy a gpu but hopefully
16:45 - that gave you a few more details because
16:47 - before i felt like i was lacking all
16:49 - right so with that said i think i'm
16:50 - about ready to end this kind of you know
16:51 - random insertion into the video i will
16:54 - also mention that if you're buying a
16:55 - dedicated gpu and you're building your
16:57 - own computer consider your power supply
17:00 - because the high-end gpus require a lot
17:02 - of power sometimes up to say 300 watts
17:04 - so you want to make sure your power
17:06 - supply has the headroom to actually
17:08 - support that again you need to do more
17:09 - research on that if you're actually
17:10 - going to be building a computer all
17:12 - right now we can move on all right so
17:14 - now let's talk about persistent storage
17:16 - devices ssds and hard drives let me
17:19 - start with hard drives so a hard drive
17:21 - is actually a physical spinning magnetic
17:23 - disk that has a read and write head that
17:26 - is able to read magnetic charges off the
17:28 - disk that means that first of all if you
17:30 - bring a magnet near your hard drive you
17:32 - will erase all of the data because it is
17:33 - magnetically charged it also means it is
17:35 - a lot slower than a solid-state drive
17:38 - because you actually physically need to
17:40 - read um magnetic bits right from the
17:43 - hard drive now i won't get into all of
17:44 - the kind of mechanical aspects of it but
17:46 - the thing is this is actually mechanical
17:48 - you have moving parts which means it's
17:50 - more prone to failure but the one
17:52 - advantage of hard drives is they are a
17:54 - lot cheaper and they have a huge storage
17:56 - capacity so what i usually recommend
17:58 - people do is get one single hard drive
18:00 - as kind of their data drive where they
18:02 - store things like files images videos
18:05 - stuff that they're not loading
18:07 - frequently because if you're loading
18:08 - stuff like your operating system from a
18:10 - hard drive it's going to be very very
18:11 - slow all right so lastly we will end off
18:14 - with ssds now an ssd is a solid state
18:16 - drive it's a very fast storage medium
18:19 - much faster than a hard drive but is
18:21 - much more expensive and has lower
18:23 - capacity so what i will say here just to
18:25 - kind of give you the quick notes because
18:27 - i'm not going to go through all of the
18:28 - differences between them is that if you
18:29 - are buying a computer make sure if it
18:31 - has one drive it's an ssd it doesn't
18:34 - really matter what the ssd is any ssd is
18:37 - going to be relatively fast and if
18:38 - you're building your own computer you
18:40 - can do some research you need to make
18:41 - sure the ssd is going to be compatible
18:43 - and all of that type of stuff
18:44 - now if you're worried about the amount
18:46 - of capacity that is in your ssd maybe
18:48 - it's only 256 gigabytes and you think
18:51 - you're going to have more files than
18:52 - that that's fine still get the ssd
18:55 - load your operating system on the ssd
18:57 - load your main programs on the ssd
18:59 - anything that you want to run quickly
19:01 - then put all of your files things like
19:03 - videos photos whatever
19:05 - on the hard drive anything that you
19:07 - don't want to access a lot where that is
19:09 - kind of just sitting there it's
19:10 - literally just storage put it on a hard
19:12 - drive anything that you use frequently
19:14 - like applications programs put it on
19:17 - your ssd because when you want to load
19:19 - something you first need to read it from
19:21 - the ssd it then gets loaded in ram and
19:24 - then it starts running so if you're
19:25 - experiencing long load times check if
19:28 - your programs are on an ssd or a hard
19:30 - drive if it's on a hard drive that's
19:32 - probably the reason and if you have your
19:34 - operating system on a hard drive i feel
19:36 - very sorry for you because your load
19:37 - times are probably 10 times longer than
19:39 - they need to be if you had the operating
19:41 - system on an ssd now i could keep going
19:44 - here for hours but i do need to end the
19:46 - video here hopefully this was helpful
19:48 - and gave you kind of a decent
19:49 - introduction to computer components
19:51 - maybe got you thinking about some of the
19:52 - specs you haven't seen before helped you
19:54 - understand some different things and how
19:56 - they work i could keep going on about
19:58 - this for hours and hours and i'm sure i
20:00 - missed some important things in this
20:01 - video if you guys think i missed
20:03 - something please leave a comment down
20:04 - below i will try to address it if you
20:06 - want more videos on computer hardware

20:10 - make those in the future with that said

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna be giving you a pc component overview slash guide where i kind of walk you through the main components in a computer discuss what their purpose is how they work with the other components and then what you should look for when you're actually purchasing these components so whether you're buying a pc building a pc maybe purchasing a laptop it's really helpful to understand what each component is what the role is in the machine and what's actually going to make a difference in terms of your performance and daytoday use of the computer so that's the goal of this video let's go ahead and get into it after quick word from our sponsor before we dive in i need to thank ltm designer for sponsoring this video

so let me begin by just walking you through the main components that every computer is going to have so in every pc every laptop doesn't matter what type of computer you have you're going to have a motherboard you're going to have a cpu that's your central processing unit you're going to have a ram which is random access memory you're going to have a graphics processing unit this may be a dedicated gpu so graphics processing unit or it may be integrated with your cpu you're then going to have some type of storage device so a hard drive or an ssd and then i just want to note here that any peripherals of things like a microphone a mouse a keyboard a monitor those are not a part of the actual computer those are things that are going to plug into the input or output devices of your motherboard and allow you to actually view what's happening on the computer so i just want to make that clear something like your monitor or your screen even if it's on a laptop that's not really a part of the actual computer the computer is simply the components that i just listed there may be a few other things depending on the build that you have but those are the main and kind of fundamental ones so with that said let's start going through each component i'll talk about the importance of them and which ones you really want to look out for when you're actually buying a computer and which ones are going to make the biggest difference for your daytoday usage alright so let's begin with arguably one of the most important components which is the cpu now the cpu is the central processing unit and a lot of people like to think of this as the brains of the computer this is one of the most important parts it's speed is really going to dictate how fast your computer is and it's going to be responsible for doing all of the arithmetic all of the math and pretty much all of the heavy lifting of the computer now it's going to utilize all of the other components and it needs those other components to work properly but it is kind of the heart of the pc or the heart of the computer and with a poor cpu it doesn't matter what other components you have your computer is going to be slow so in terms of looking out for different cpus and kind of the properties of cpus you're going to have two main brands that you're going to be going to when you're purchasing a cpu or even purchasing a prebuilt computer that comes with the cpu now that's going to be amd and intel now recently amd has been outperforming intel when it comes to value for cpus so personally i recommend amd cpus however intel does still have a large market share and tons of computers come with intel cpus it doesn't really matter if you have an intel vs amd cpu some are better at specific tasks but what you really want to look for when you're looking at a cpu is the specs of the cpu so the number of cores the speed of those cores and then the number of threads as well now when you're looking at a cpu i would say the minimum amount of cores that you really want to go with in 2021 is four now there is a lot of cpus that are dual core cpus you're going to see these in very entrylevel machines very basic computers maybe even in things like phones now dual core cpus are fine if you're only doing something like web browsing or word processing but if you want to play any type of video game if you want to load multiple applications at the same time if you want a relatively snappy feel to your pc you're really going to want to go with at least four cores now when you're looking at cores you're probably also going to see something that says threats now typically the number of threads is going to be double the number of cores i don't want to get into that because this is kind of a video for beginners but essentially you don't really need to worry about the threads just look at the cores almost all modern cpus have something called hyper threading which kind of allows each core to perform multiple operations at a time that's why you'll see something like multiple threads or more threads than the number of cores now other than that you're going to see a speed for the core so if you see something like 3.8 gigahertz 4.2 gigahertz and then you'll see things like turbo clock boost clock all of these kind of marketing things you'll see on cpus right the speed of the cpu is very important but one thing to note is that just because a cpu has a higher speed does not mean that it's going to outperform one with a lower speed for example if i have a cpu that has six cores and you have one that has two cores but your cores are clocked at four gigahertz that's the speed of your cpu my cpu even if it's clocked at say 2.5 gigahertz is gonna outperform your cpu in almost every single task that core speed that you're seeing there is the speed of a single core so you can kind of multiply the speed by the number of cores and that will relatively tell you how quick the cpu is going to be now this is not a precise calculation and in some situations you do actually want a higher clock speed than the number of cores especially if you're running single threaded applications i'm not going to get into that again because this is for beginners but the idea is for most common people you're going to favor more cores over a higher clock speed and most modern cpus are going to be clocked at least 3 gigahertz which is going to be more than fast enough for you to have a very responsive and kind of fast experience using the computer alright so now let's talk about ram which is random access memory now ram is a temporary storage location now this means if you turn off your cpu anything in ram is going to disappear it's going to be gone now the point of ram is to store data that needs to be readily available to the cpu or the computer so it can very quickly be accessed and very quickly be changed so any programs that you're running on your computer will utilize a small amount of ram or if you're talking about something like google chrome a large amount of ram because they're going to be storing all of their program data in ram so it's very quick to access now this is in contrast to something like an ssd or a hard drive which is going to be a much slower storage medium but is going to be persistent meaning when you turn off the computer the data on there is going to stay it's not going to be deleted anyways let's talk about what you want to look for when you're looking for ram so ram has many different forums you have ddr2 ddr3 and ddr4 and one very important thing to note is that laptop ram is different than desktop ram so you cannot put laptop ram in your desktop that's not going to work so just keep that in mind i've know many people who have accidentally bought the wrong type of rep anyways the main kind of i guess types or generations of ram that we have right now is ddr3 and ddr4 now ddr3 is a much older style of ram that's probably a red flag if you're buying a computer if it has ddr3 you're gonna perfor prefer ddr4 sorry which has a much higher kind of stock speed now when we're looking at ram we have all kinds of speeds anywhere from something like two six six six megahertz uh to something like 3200 megahertz or 3600 megahertz now the ram speed doesn't matter a ton for most of you but if you are building your own computer then you want to go with a higher ram speed rather than a lower ram speed now ideally the sweet spot is probably going to be around 32 to 3 400 megahertz for your ram but for most of you you're not gonna have that option and you're not even gonna see that speed if you're buying a prebuilt computer so in terms of the amount of ram for most of you you're going to want either 8 or 16 gigabytes of ram now you could get 4 gigabytes of ram if you're going with a very entrylevel computer but just keep in mind that this is going to be an entrylevel computer it's going to be slow it's not going to be the most performant so i would recommend as a minimum for most people unless you're really on a budget eight gigabytes of rent now 16 gigabytes is going to be the sweet spot this is a really nice middle ground you almost never need more than 16 gigabytes and again for most of you you're going to want that amount now some of you may be saying well can't i get 17 gigabytes the answer is no you need to have a certain denomination of ram it's gonna be a power of two so either two gigabytes four gigabytes eight sixteen thirty two sixty four one twenty eight that's just how ram works you'll see some weird computers that have like six gigabytes of ram don't worry about that that's kind of an exception to what i'm saying for most of you again you're gonna want either eight or 16 gigs now if you are doing anything that is going to require more ram you have a really high end cpu you're doing video editing maybe you're rendering a bunch of stuff then you may want to consider going up to 32 gigabytes of ram and if you're doing machine learning ai a ton of data processing and you need that loaded for your models you probably might want to go up to 64. now in my personal computer i have 64 gigabytes of ram i have never needed to use that amount the most i've probably ever used to be like 32 gigs and even that again like 32 gigs would be completely fine for my computer now one kind of random rule of thumb here that i'm going to throw in is that if you have a very high end gpu so something like a 30 90 a 3080 a titan then you're going to want to have double the amount of ram than your video memory now i'm going to talk about video memory in a second but if you have 24 gigabytes of vram you're going to want at least 48 gigabytes of ram which means you should probably go to 64. i won't talk about all the reasons for that but just keep that in mind in case you're getting a very highend gpu so now let's move on to motherboard now the motherboard is going to be the bridge or the connection between all your different pc components so your graphics card your cpu your ram all of that is going to go directly on the motherboard and the way they're going to communicate is through the bus on the motherboard now the motherboard is also going to deliver power to the components unless the components have a their own separate kind of power connection anyways the motherboard is important but for most of you you're not going to have to pick it out or even look at the specs because it's just going to come with whatever computer you buy if you are building your own computer do some research i'm not going to talk about a ton in this video it is very important that you pick a motherboard that's compatible with your cpu your amount of ram and all of the expansion cards you may want to add and other features like fan headers uh and like extra usb ports and stuff like that now your motherboard will also have the input and output devices so it will have usb ports on it it will have audio jacks it might have an hdmi or vga port if you have an integrated graphics card all of this type of stuff uh anyways that's pretty much it for motherboard again not super important don't worry about it unless you are building your own computer in which case do some research all right so let's go to gpu which is graphics processing unit now this is very important if you are doing anything graphics intensive like 3d rendering video editing playing video games if that's the case you're going to want to get something known as a dedicated gpu however if you are not doing any of that then you can get an integrated gpu now an integrated gpu is built into the cpu which means you don't have to buy a separate component it's just already there now you do require either an integrated or a dedicated gpu to get a display output and the reason i'm saying that is because some cpus do not come with integrated graphics so most amd cpus do not have integrated graphics meaning you actually need a graphics card to get some output from the computer however most intel cpus do which means that you can just directly plug in a cable to the motherboard and you'll be able to actually see something on your monitor okay hopefully that makes sense now i don't want to go through all the different gpu models because there's so many and there's a lot of great reviews out there from people other than me but when you are buying a computer the first thing you want to consider is do i need a gpu or do i not need a gpu then you're gonna look at the different levels of gpus and depending on what you're doing and the specs of your other components you're gonna pick a gpu now you want your gpu to be balanced with your cpu amount of ram and all of that type of stuff don't go buy a 39 d if you have a 4 core cpu that's unnecessary and you're going to bottleneck this crazy gpu with a very poor cpu relative to the performance of the gpu alright so i was just editing this video and i realized i missed some important details in the gpu section so i just wanted to kind of fill those in here now i don't want to give you a treat though if you've stuck around until this point in the video and i'm going to show you that this is my cat this is fresca she's hanging out on the desk right here she's like always on my desk when i'm working which is nice but also quite annoying if i'm trying to type or something like that anyways i just wanted to introduce her in case you guys haven't seen her kind of walking around on the desk in my videos regardless let's now get into those missing details so gpus when you're looking at a dedicated gpu that's kind of what i'm going to be talking about now you're going to have two companies that are going to be providing the gpus amd and nvidia now nvidia is kind of the preferred company for gpus that's the one i personally recommend just because they're more mainstream they have like larger market share and uh their drivers and all these things are more compatible with more stuff they have some other cool features like nvidia broadcast which you can only get access to if you have specific uh series gpus from nvidia now also if i'm mispronouncing that let me know in the comments because i never know how to pronounce that company name anyways let's continue all right so amd totally fine if you get an amd gpu that's all right in fact most mac computers are going to come with an amd gpu and that's because i think they have some special like proprietary partnership regardless those are fine now when you're looking at the specs of a gpu the first thing you're going to want to look at is the generation of the gpu so is it first gen second gen third gen is it a 20 series is a 30 series you just want to look at how recent it is and obviously you're going to want to go for the most recent gpu that you can now other than that you're going to want to look at the amount of video memory now video memory otherwise known as vram is special dedicated memory very similar to regular ram but just for the graphics card now the graphics card is actually going to be responsible for rendering all of your frames so if you're playing a video game your video memory is going to act as a video buffer and what that means is you're going to have all of your frames and everything that you're going to be seeing kind of being stored in the vram first and then being passed to the display output where you'll actually see it on the screen now again take all this with a grain of salt it's just an over simplification to give you a general kind of explanation of what's going on but essentially the more video memory the better now as i said before you want to have double the ram of your video memory so if you have an 8 gig video memory card you want 16 gigabytes of ram this is just so you can load uh the vram of the gpu fast enough if you don't have enough ram then it's going to go slower it's not going to load as fast as it possibly can okay so in terms of the amount of vram you want the minimum you're probably gonna get is four now in some gpus there will be two gigabytes of ram that's pretty unnecessary at that point you don't even really need a dedicated gpu but in any gpu that is actually gonna do anything meaningful for you it's probably gonna have four gigabytes of ram now four gigabytes is nice to have if you're not going to be doing any super high res gaming or high settings gaming maybe you just want to do a little light video editing you want like some graphics power that's where you would go with four gigabytes but the sweet spot is gonna be six eight or 12 gigabytes now for most people you're gonna be getting a card that has six or eight gigabytes in it as soon as you start going up to 12 or 24 gigabytes you're getting into the really expensive highend graphics cards and at that point i probably don't need to tell you what to buy you probably already know what you're looking for anyways those are kind of the details i wanted to add in again i would prefer an nvidia gpu especially if you're gonna be gaming however if you're just doing some light video editing you could definitely go with the lower end gpu like an amd gpu that has four gigabytes of video memory now it's also very important again to look at the generation the older gen the gpu obviously the worse it's going to perform and the less features it's going to have the new highend gpus have a ton of awesome features that most modern games will take advantage of say like ray tracing if you go with say a 10 series nvidia gpu you're not gonna have those features so keep that in mind you definitely need to do more research on this before you buy a gpu but hopefully that gave you a few more details because before i felt like i was lacking all right so with that said i think i'm about ready to end this kind of you know random insertion into the video i will also mention that if you're buying a dedicated gpu and you're building your own computer consider your power supply because the highend gpus require a lot of power sometimes up to say 300 watts so you want to make sure your power supply has the headroom to actually support that again you need to do more research on that if you're actually going to be building a computer all right now we can move on all right so now let's talk about persistent storage devices ssds and hard drives let me start with hard drives so a hard drive is actually a physical spinning magnetic disk that has a read and write head that is able to read magnetic charges off the disk that means that first of all if you bring a magnet near your hard drive you will erase all of the data because it is magnetically charged it also means it is a lot slower than a solidstate drive because you actually physically need to read um magnetic bits right from the hard drive now i won't get into all of the kind of mechanical aspects of it but the thing is this is actually mechanical you have moving parts which means it's more prone to failure but the one advantage of hard drives is they are a lot cheaper and they have a huge storage capacity so what i usually recommend people do is get one single hard drive as kind of their data drive where they store things like files images videos stuff that they're not loading frequently because if you're loading stuff like your operating system from a hard drive it's going to be very very slow all right so lastly we will end off with ssds now an ssd is a solid state drive it's a very fast storage medium much faster than a hard drive but is much more expensive and has lower capacity so what i will say here just to kind of give you the quick notes because i'm not going to go through all of the differences between them is that if you are buying a computer make sure if it has one drive it's an ssd it doesn't really matter what the ssd is any ssd is going to be relatively fast and if you're building your own computer you can do some research you need to make sure the ssd is going to be compatible and all of that type of stuff now if you're worried about the amount of capacity that is in your ssd maybe it's only 256 gigabytes and you think you're going to have more files than that that's fine still get the ssd load your operating system on the ssd load your main programs on the ssd anything that you want to run quickly then put all of your files things like videos photos whatever on the hard drive anything that you don't want to access a lot where that is kind of just sitting there it's literally just storage put it on a hard drive anything that you use frequently like applications programs put it on your ssd because when you want to load something you first need to read it from the ssd it then gets loaded in ram and then it starts running so if you're experiencing long load times check if your programs are on an ssd or a hard drive if it's on a hard drive that's probably the reason and if you have your operating system on a hard drive i feel very sorry for you because your load times are probably 10 times longer than they need to be if you had the operating system on an ssd now i could keep going here for hours but i do need to end the video here hopefully this was helpful and gave you kind of a decent introduction to computer components maybe got you thinking about some of the specs you haven't seen before helped you understand some different things and how they work i could keep going on about this for hours and hours and i'm sure i missed some important things in this video if you guys think i missed something please leave a comment down below i will try to address it if you want more videos on computer hardware then definitely let me know and i will make those in the future with that said make sure to check out programmingexpert.io tim if you want to learn to code and i will see you in another youtube video
