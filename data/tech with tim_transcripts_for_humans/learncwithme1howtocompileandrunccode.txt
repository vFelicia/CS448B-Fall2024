00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new tutorial series on this channel
00:04 - where i'm going to be covering the c
00:06 - plus language for
00:07 - beginners so this tutorial series is
00:10 - fully suited for anyone who has never
00:12 - used c
00:12 - plus plus before never written any code
00:14 - in their life
00:15 - before that said it obviously will be
00:17 - easier to follow along if you programmed
00:19 - before but i will make sure i explain
00:21 - everything and if you've never
00:22 - programmed before this is the place to
00:24 - be
00:24 - don't worry i will teach you everything
00:26 - you need to know there's going to be no
00:27 - prerequisite information or
00:29 - any tech literacy you really need to
00:31 - know before going through a series like
00:33 - this
00:33 - with that said though this series is
00:35 - titled learn c
00:37 - plus with me or you probably saw that in
00:39 - the thumbnail at least now the idea
00:40 - behind this series which is a little bit
00:42 - different than what i usually do
00:43 - is i am not extremely familiar with c
00:46 - plus plus in fact i just started
00:48 - learning c plus plus the other day and i
00:49 - thought it would be an interesting idea
00:51 - to kind of have a tutorial series where
00:53 - i am learning alongside you so right
00:55 - before i film the video i'm going to
00:57 - mess around with whatever it is that i'm
00:58 - going to be teaching
00:59 - and then immediately hop into the video
01:01 - and start teaching it
01:02 - personally i find the best way to learn
01:04 - is to teach and i just thought this
01:06 - would be kind of a cool
01:07 - series so again just want to be super
01:08 - clear i'm non-expert at c
01:10 - plus i'm gonna do all of the necessary
01:12 - research beforehand to make sure i'm not
01:14 - giving you guys incorrect
01:15 - information but i love explaining stuff
01:17 - to people i love
01:18 - learning a new language and i just
01:19 - thought this would be kind of a fun
01:20 - series and it gives me an opportunity to
01:22 - kind of cover things that i myself found
01:24 - very difficult in the c plus plus
01:26 - language
01:27 - and really focus on them in the tutorial
01:29 - whereas someone who's maybe an expert in
01:30 - c plus plus may have kind of forgotten
01:32 - about what
01:33 - beginners find quite difficult in a new
01:35 - language like this
01:36 - so with that said in this first video
01:38 - here i'm going to discuss how you can
01:40 - compile and run a c
01:41 - plus plus program i'm going to show you
01:43 - how to set up your coding environment
01:46 - whether you're on mac linux or windows
01:48 - and then in future videos we'll actually
01:50 - get into the code
01:51 - and i will go all the way up until
01:52 - object oriented programming
01:54 - in c plus so with that said let's dive
01:57 - in
02:00 - [Music]
02:06 - so before i actually get into the
02:07 - install and setup steps i figured it
02:09 - wouldn't be a bad idea
02:10 - to discuss what c plus plus is used for
02:13 - and why you may want to learn
02:14 - so first of all c plus plus kind of gets
02:16 - a reputation of being a very difficult
02:18 - programming language to learn
02:19 - i would argue that it's not that hard to
02:21 - learn especially if you haven't learned
02:23 - another programming language before
02:25 - and it's really not that difficult it's
02:27 - just different than some other languages
02:29 - like python or javascript
02:30 - so don't be intimidated by that if
02:32 - you've heard something like that before
02:33 - this is a great language to start with
02:35 - again not going to be the absolute
02:37 - easiest one to learn but definitely a
02:39 - good option and you're not going to
02:40 - regret learning c plus plus as your
02:42 - first or maybe even second programming
02:44 - language
02:45 - now with that said c plus plus is a very
02:47 - popular programming language it's used
02:49 - by tens of millions of developers
02:51 - it's probably in the top five maybe in
02:53 - maybe even in the top three of the most
02:55 - popular programming languages out there
02:57 - it's been around for a really long time
02:59 - it's used for a ton of different
03:00 - applications it's used for 3d games
03:03 - operating systems compilers interpreters
03:06 - embedded systems
03:07 - desktop applications websites database
03:09 - software
03:10 - i could go on and list about a million
03:12 - things super versatile
03:14 - super fast programming language it's
03:16 - very efficient and performance optimized
03:18 - if you're writing any kind of code where
03:20 - you really care about the execution time
03:22 - of that code
03:23 - then c plus plus is a really good choice
03:26 - for whatever that application or code is
03:28 - going to be
03:29 - so i could go on and on about why you
03:30 - would want to learn c plus plus but just
03:32 - trust me it's a great language you're
03:33 - definitely going to enjoy it learning it
03:35 - and it's super versatile you can do a
03:37 - ton of stuff with it so with that said
03:40 - let's now dive in to the install setup
03:42 - steps
03:43 - so what i'm going to show you how to do
03:44 - specifically is how to install a c
03:46 - plus plus compiler and a code editor
03:49 - that you can actually write your code in
03:51 - so in theory you can write c plus plus
03:53 - code in anything
03:54 - you can write it in notepad you can
03:56 - write it in notepad plus plus you can
03:58 - write it in
03:59 - i don't know what it's called on windows
04:01 - like or not windows or
04:02 - mac whatever their default little text
04:04 - editor is you can write it in that
04:06 - you don't need like a dedicated code
04:08 - editor to write c
04:09 - plus code in however if you want to get
04:11 - nice syntax highlighting
04:13 - you want to get auto complete and some
04:14 - other just nice features to have when
04:16 - you're writing code
04:17 - you're going to want to install a text
04:18 - editor or a
04:20 - ide so like something like visual studio
04:22 - code if you don't know what that is
04:23 - don't worry about it in this tutorial
04:25 - series i'm going to be using a text
04:27 - editor called sublime text
04:28 - this is a really lightweight really
04:30 - minimalist text editor
04:32 - i really like it for doing basic
04:33 - tutorials and i would recommend
04:35 - if you're someone who's just starting
04:36 - out and you don't kind of know about any
04:37 - other text editors or ide
04:39 - just go with the sublime text editor
04:41 - it's free and you can get it from the
04:42 - link in the description
04:43 - so just download this sublime text
04:45 - editor and then
04:46 - open it up and you will now have an
04:48 - environment in which you can write code
04:50 - in now if you're on windows your install
04:53 - steps are going to be a little bit
04:55 - different than if you're
04:56 - on mac so if you're on mac windows or
04:58 - linux you need a text editor or you need
05:00 - something to write your code in so pick
05:01 - whatever that is that you want
05:03 - i recommend recommend sublime text for
05:05 - this tutorial
05:06 - and then if you're on mac your setup is
05:08 - done you actually already have
05:10 - a c plus compiler installed on your
05:11 - computer i'll show you how to access
05:13 - that in a minute
05:14 - if you're on linux same thing you
05:16 - already have a compiler in your system
05:18 - however if you're on windows you do not
05:19 - so you need to install one
05:21 - so there's this thing called ming gw not
05:23 - really going to get into exactly what
05:25 - this
05:25 - is but go to the link in the description
05:27 - download this
05:28 - run through the installer if you see any
05:30 - options just
05:31 - leave them completely default the only
05:34 - thing you should change if you want to
05:35 - is the install location
05:37 - of this program make sure when you
05:39 - install this you keep track of where you
05:41 - install it so if you installed on a
05:43 - different drive or something like that
05:44 - just make sure you know where it is
05:45 - because we are going to need to find
05:47 - the actual location of this on our on
05:50 - our disk or
05:51 - i guess on our drive so go ahead run
05:53 - through this install again link in the
05:55 - description
05:56 - once it's installed you need to make
05:58 - sure you remember where you installed
06:00 - okay so now that you have this installed
06:02 - assuming you're on windows again if
06:03 - you're on mac you can kind of fast
06:04 - forward a bit until this is done
06:06 - what you want to do is you want to find
06:08 - this program from your file explorer
06:11 - so open up your file explorer go to your
06:13 - drive
06:14 - i'm going to go to this pc i'm going to
06:16 - go to my c drive this is where i
06:17 - installed my program
06:19 - and just go and locate wherever you
06:20 - installed so it should be by default
06:23 - in your c drive in program files x86 and
06:26 - then you should scroll down
06:27 - and you should see the ming gws
06:31 - ming gw64 now go inside of all these
06:34 - folders that i'm showing you so go
06:35 - inside of this one
06:37 - go inside of the ming gw folder then go
06:40 - inside of bin
06:42 - so again this is specific if you're on
06:43 - windows now what you want to do is you
06:45 - want to get the path
06:46 - to this bin notice here there's
06:49 - all kind of executable files here these
06:52 - are actually a bunch of different
06:53 - interpreters
06:53 - that you can use for other programming
06:55 - languages or sorry not interpreters
06:57 - compilers
06:58 - so you can see g plus plus this is one
07:00 - that we're actually going to use
07:02 - for this video right here again you
07:04 - don't need to worry about all of this
07:05 - but just find this install location so
07:07 - if you click on your little bar here
07:09 - you can copy this install location so
07:11 - copy it to
07:12 - your clipboard now that you have this
07:14 - installed what you need to do
07:16 - is you need to go and modify your path
07:18 - variable
07:19 - now a path is just kind of a list of all
07:22 - of the locations to different
07:24 - executable files on your machine now the
07:26 - reason we need to add
07:28 - this right here to our path is so that
07:30 - we can actually use
07:31 - the c plus compiler from our command
07:34 - line
07:35 - you'll see how this works in a second
07:36 - but what you're going to type here in
07:37 - your windows search bar
07:38 - is just path now it should pop up this
07:41 - thing that says edit the system
07:42 - environment variables you want to go to
07:44 - a tab that looks like this again you
07:45 - could type in
07:46 - edit the system environment variables
07:48 - open this up what you're going to see is
07:49 - you have all of these different tabs
07:51 - go to the advanced tab go to environment
07:54 - variables
07:54 - and then you should see something that
07:56 - says path now when you're
07:58 - on path what you're going to do is
07:59 - you're going to press edit you're
08:00 - probably going to see a ton of other
08:02 - stuff inside of here
08:03 - what you want to do now is you want to
08:05 - add the path
08:06 - to this install location so whatever you
08:09 - just installed you want to add the path
08:11 - to that that's the path we just copied
08:13 - so we're going to press new and then
08:14 - we're just going to paste in that path
08:16 - that we have you can see i already have
08:17 - mine here
08:18 - so i'm not actually going to do this but
08:20 - just go ahead and paste it in so let me
08:21 - just remove that
08:22 - because i don't need it twice so once
08:25 - that is in there you're going to press
08:26 - ok and then you're going to press ok
08:28 - again and then if apply is able to be
08:31 - pressed
08:31 - press apply it probably won't be then
08:33 - you just press ok
08:34 - now what you've done is you've added the
08:36 - path to that install location
08:38 - so now any of those files that were in
08:40 - that bin you can now access them
08:42 - without having to type out their entire
08:44 - path from your command prompt
08:46 - so now on windows what you want to do to
08:48 - test that this is working is
08:49 - open up your command prompt and you want
08:51 - to type g plus plus
08:53 - now g plus plus is a c plus plus
08:55 - compiler which i will discuss in a
08:57 - second
08:57 - so you type g plus plus and just press
08:59 - enter if you get some type of output
09:01 - even if it says fatal error that's
09:02 - totally fine
09:03 - that is good if you see something that
09:05 - says g plus plus is not a recognized
09:07 - command
09:08 - you need to make sure you follow along
09:09 - with the steps i just showed you and
09:11 - that you added this to the path
09:12 - try to restart your command prompt and
09:14 - then boot it up again and see if this
09:16 - works but it should work after you go
09:17 - through those steps
09:18 - so now you should have your cbos plus
09:21 - compiler installed
09:22 - and we're ready to actually go ahead and
09:23 - start writing some code so at this point
09:25 - in time all of the mac people you can
09:27 - start listening again uh you will have
09:29 - this g plus plus compiler
09:31 - on your machine by default so you guys
09:32 - should open up your terminal
09:34 - you should type g plus plus in here and
09:36 - you should see if that works
09:38 - now again that just should work if
09:40 - you're on macro linux i don't know why
09:41 - that wouldn't work that should work for
09:43 - you
09:43 - and then we're kind of ready to go so
09:46 - now this is a good point for me to
09:47 - discuss
09:47 - what i mean by compiler because i keep
09:49 - saying this word compiler you've
09:50 - probably heard me say interpreter 2
09:52 - a compiler kind of takes the source code
09:55 - that we write
09:56 - and it transcribes it or translates it
09:59 - into a binary executable file
10:02 - so by default whenever you write c plus
10:04 - code you can't just run
10:05 - that code that is just you know plain
10:07 - text on your computer
10:08 - the computer doesn't understand that so
10:10 - what the compiler does is it takes this
10:12 - code
10:13 - it translates it into machine language
10:15 - or into a binary language
10:17 - that a uh that your computer can
10:18 - actually understand and that it can run
10:20 - so what's going to happen is every time
10:21 - we write our code whenever we want to
10:23 - run it we're going to compile the code
10:25 - translate it into this new file and then
10:27 - this new file will have our program in a
10:30 - binary format
10:31 - we will then run that program and there
10:33 - we go
10:34 - we'll run that file that will run our
10:35 - program and we will be good to go
10:37 - so that is the difference between c plus
10:38 - plus and some other programming
10:40 - languages say like python you wouldn't
10:41 - have to do something like this
10:43 - okay so hopefully that makes sense uh
10:45 - that is what i mean by compiler
10:47 - so now what we're going to do is we're
10:48 - going to write our very first c plus
10:50 - program so you're going to open up
10:51 - subline text on whatever
10:52 - editor or whatever operating system
10:54 - you're using or if you're not using
10:55 - subline text open up your editor and
10:57 - create a new file
10:59 - now this new file you create must have a
11:01 - dot cpp
11:02 - file extension cpp stands for c plus
11:05 - plus so whenever you write your c plus
11:07 - code you're going to put it in a dot cpp
11:09 - file now if you're working in a text
11:11 - editor like sublime text
11:13 - as soon as you start typing you'll
11:14 - notice your text is going to be
11:15 - highlighted in different colors
11:17 - that kind of tells you that you're
11:18 - getting syntax highlighting in that
11:20 - this editor recognizes that the code
11:22 - that you're writing is c plus plus code
11:24 - so we will continue the tutorial in one
11:26 - second but i need to quickly thank
11:28 - the sponsor of this video and this
11:29 - series which is algo expert
11:31 - algo expert is the best platform to use
11:33 - for preparing for your software
11:34 - engineering coding interviews
11:36 - they have over 140 coding interview
11:38 - questions on the platform
11:39 - which are just the highest quality
11:41 - resources you can use to prepare for
11:43 - your technical coding interviews
11:44 - so with that said get started using algo
11:46 - expert today by clicking the link in the
11:48 - description
11:49 - and using the code tech with tim for a
11:50 - discount on the platform
11:52 - so what we're going to do is write a
11:54 - really standard hello world program i'm
11:56 - not really going to explain what i'm
11:57 - writing
11:57 - just write it out here this is just the
11:59 - test that our environment is set up
12:01 - so what we're going to do is the
12:02 - following we're going to say include
12:04 - and then inside of angle brackets we're
12:06 - going to say io
12:07 - stream like that then underneath this
12:10 - line what we're going to type is using
12:13 - namespace std you might get this
12:15 - autocomplete if you're working
12:17 - in in sublime text and then we're going
12:20 - to put a semicolon at the end of this
12:22 - line
12:22 - a semicolon is a terminator it tells you
12:25 - that whatever statement you just wrote
12:26 - is now terminated
12:28 - now what these two lines are kind of
12:29 - doing is they're saying we're going to
12:31 - include a library that allows us to
12:32 - actually print information to the
12:34 - console
12:35 - and this namespace is going to give us
12:36 - access to things that are in the
12:38 - standard uh c plus plus library so just
12:40 - like pieces of syntax
12:42 - again you don't have to know what that
12:43 - means just trying to give you a bit of
12:44 - information
12:45 - now we're going to create a function
12:47 - we're going to say int
12:49 - main we're going to put two parentheses
12:50 - like this and then we're gonna put two
12:52 - curly braces
12:52 - and inside of here we're gonna write the
12:54 - following line we're gonna write
12:56 - c out we're gonna write these two things
12:58 - right here i think these are less than
12:59 - signs although i always mix up if
13:01 - they're less than or greater than you're
13:02 - gonna write two of these here
13:04 - and then you're gonna put inside of
13:05 - quotation marks make sure they're double
13:07 - quotation marks
13:08 - hello world exclamation point semicolon
13:11 - and then on the next line you're going
13:12 - to say return
13:13 - 0. now as soon as we get through a few
13:15 - videos here all of this will make
13:16 - perfect sense you will know this like
13:17 - the back of your hand
13:18 - but for right now just kind of take for
13:20 - granted the fact that this is going to
13:21 - print something out to the console
13:23 - and this is our very first c plus plus
13:25 - program all this is going to do
13:26 - is print this hello world so when we run
13:28 - this code all we're going to see is that
13:30 - a little bit of textures of the console
13:31 - that says hello
13:33 - so go ahead and save that control s and
13:36 - then what you want to do is you want to
13:37 - compile
13:38 - this file so to compile this file you
13:41 - need to open up your terminal
13:43 - or your command prompt depending on the
13:44 - operating system you're on and you need
13:46 - to navigate
13:47 - to the directory you're storing this
13:49 - file in so i've created a folder on my
13:51 - desktop it's called c plus plus tutorial
13:53 - inside i have my file tutorial1.cpp
13:56 - so open up your terminal open up your
13:58 - command prompt and you need to use the
14:00 - cd command which stands for change
14:02 - directory to get
14:03 - into the directory where this file is
14:05 - contained so a little bit of a shortcut
14:07 - if you're on
14:08 - windows here is if you just go to the
14:09 - directory from your file explorer like
14:11 - you normally would so let's go to c plus
14:13 - plus tutorial
14:14 - and then you go here so this little
14:16 - search bar and you delete all of this
14:18 - and you type cmd
14:19 - this will open up the command prompt in
14:21 - this location so notice the location is
14:23 - where we just where
14:24 - and then you're good to go so if you're
14:26 - on mac you're probably going to be
14:27 - in some directory that is not your
14:29 - desktop you're probably going to be in
14:30 - your user's home directory
14:31 - which means you should have something
14:33 - like users and then whatever your name
14:34 - is or something like that
14:36 - so what you're going to do is you're
14:37 - going to navigate to wherever you're
14:38 - storing this file so if it's on your
14:39 - desktop for example you're going to type
14:41 - cd desktop and then that's going to
14:43 - bring you to your desktop so let's
14:45 - actually just go ahead and do this
14:46 - ignore the two lines i just typed let's
14:48 - say i'm on mac and i'm in this
14:49 - this area i type cd desktop i go to my
14:53 - desktop
14:53 - notice now the path changes the desktop
14:55 - then i'm going to type cd
14:57 - and i'm going to go to whatever
14:58 - directory this file is contained in so
15:00 - maybe you have a folder called c
15:02 - plus tutorial by the way you can type
15:04 - the first few characters of whatever you
15:06 - want to go
15:06 - and press tab and it should auto fill it
15:08 - so if i do c and then tab it auto fills
15:10 - c
15:11 - tutorial so go ahead and press enter and
15:14 - now from here
15:15 - you should be good to go so just
15:16 - navigate using cd which stands for
15:18 - change
15:18 - directory to the directory you want to
15:20 - go to if you make a mistake and you need
15:22 - to go back
15:22 - type cd dot dot this will bring you back
15:25 - to the parent directory so we'll move
15:26 - you back one notice here
15:28 - this moves me from c swiss tutorial back
15:30 - to desktop
15:31 - anyways i have this uh command prompt
15:33 - open
15:34 - in this directory now what i'm going to
15:36 - do is compile my c
15:37 - plus file to do this i'm going to type g
15:40 - plus this will work on both mac
15:41 - and windows i'm going to type hyphen o
15:44 - which i believe stands for
15:45 - out then i'm going to type the name of
15:47 - the file
15:48 - that i want to contain the compiled code
15:50 - so the name of the file i want to run
15:52 - i'm going to call this run or i'll call
15:54 - this like run
15:56 - program or something call it whatever
15:57 - you want doesn't matter and then after
15:59 - this you're going to put the name of the
16:01 - file you want to compile
16:02 - in this case the name of my file is
16:04 - tutorial1 so whatever you named your
16:06 - file you put here
16:07 - and then you press enter so g plus plus
16:10 - hyphen o
16:10 - run program name of the file that
16:12 - contains the code you wrote
16:14 - dot cpp press enter you're gonna see
16:17 - that you're gonna get no output if you
16:18 - get no output
16:19 - that is good now what you can do is you
16:22 - can type
16:23 - this name right here that contains the
16:25 - kind of output file
16:27 - so i'm going to say run program and just
16:29 - press enter when you do that you should
16:31 - see that hello world
16:32 - pops up on the screen if you're on mac
16:34 - or linux type dot slash
16:36 - run program and that should work so
16:38 - either of them should probably work but
16:40 - on mac and linux i'm not sure because i
16:42 - haven't done this you probably need to
16:43 - type
16:44 - dot slash and that should then run the
16:46 - file for you but you can run this as
16:47 - many times as you want it contains the
16:49 - compiled code
16:51 - now just notice something here if i
16:52 - change this what i'm kind of printing
16:54 - out to the screen
16:55 - to just say hello and i save this file
16:58 - and then i go ahead
16:59 - and i try to run this code again so i do
17:01 - run program
17:02 - notice it's still printing hello world
17:04 - the reason for this is i have not
17:06 - recompiled my code so what i need to do
17:09 - to recompile my code or to get this
17:11 - program to now be updated with the new
17:13 - code i wrote is i need to compile it
17:15 - again
17:15 - so a little shortcut here if you press
17:17 - the up arrow on your keyboard this will
17:19 - cycle through the commands you've
17:20 - already typed
17:20 - so since i'm already in the same
17:22 - directory and i just want to compile the
17:24 - same file again
17:24 - and i want it to go to the same output
17:26 - file i'll just rerun this command
17:28 - so now that i rerun this command it
17:30 - should recompile my
17:32 - code or compile it again and now what i
17:34 - can do is just type the name of that
17:35 - program so we'll say run program
17:37 - and now notice it just says hello so
17:40 - there you go
17:41 - that is the basics of how to set up your
17:42 - machine to run c plus plus code
17:45 - so that is all i had for tutorial one i
17:47 - apologize this was a little bit slow i
17:49 - just want to make sure i go through
17:50 - every single possible edge case and
17:53 - thing that could go wrong
17:54 - so you guys can follow along and aren't
17:55 - getting frustrated and stuck at a ton of
17:57 - things
17:58 - you'll probably notice with my tutorials
17:59 - i'm very verbose i go through
18:01 - everything and i just want to make sure
18:03 - i'm giving you as much information as i
18:04 - can so that this is the only resource
18:06 - you need to go to
18:07 - you don't need to go and look up a
18:08 - million things after the video because i
18:10 - didn't cover them
18:10 - so with that said i hope you guys
18:12 - enjoyed if you did make sure you leave a
18:13 - like
18:14 - subscribe to the channel i will see you
18:16 - in another youtube video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on this channel where i'm going to be covering the c plus language for beginners so this tutorial series is fully suited for anyone who has never used c plus plus before never written any code in their life before that said it obviously will be easier to follow along if you programmed before but i will make sure i explain everything and if you've never programmed before this is the place to be don't worry i will teach you everything you need to know there's going to be no prerequisite information or any tech literacy you really need to know before going through a series like this with that said though this series is titled learn c plus with me or you probably saw that in the thumbnail at least now the idea behind this series which is a little bit different than what i usually do is i am not extremely familiar with c plus plus in fact i just started learning c plus plus the other day and i thought it would be an interesting idea to kind of have a tutorial series where i am learning alongside you so right before i film the video i'm going to mess around with whatever it is that i'm going to be teaching and then immediately hop into the video and start teaching it personally i find the best way to learn is to teach and i just thought this would be kind of a cool series so again just want to be super clear i'm nonexpert at c plus i'm gonna do all of the necessary research beforehand to make sure i'm not giving you guys incorrect information but i love explaining stuff to people i love learning a new language and i just thought this would be kind of a fun series and it gives me an opportunity to kind of cover things that i myself found very difficult in the c plus plus language and really focus on them in the tutorial whereas someone who's maybe an expert in c plus plus may have kind of forgotten about what beginners find quite difficult in a new language like this so with that said in this first video here i'm going to discuss how you can compile and run a c plus plus program i'm going to show you how to set up your coding environment whether you're on mac linux or windows and then in future videos we'll actually get into the code and i will go all the way up until object oriented programming in c plus so with that said let's dive in so before i actually get into the install and setup steps i figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to discuss what c plus plus is used for and why you may want to learn so first of all c plus plus kind of gets a reputation of being a very difficult programming language to learn i would argue that it's not that hard to learn especially if you haven't learned another programming language before and it's really not that difficult it's just different than some other languages like python or javascript so don't be intimidated by that if you've heard something like that before this is a great language to start with again not going to be the absolute easiest one to learn but definitely a good option and you're not going to regret learning c plus plus as your first or maybe even second programming language now with that said c plus plus is a very popular programming language it's used by tens of millions of developers it's probably in the top five maybe in maybe even in the top three of the most popular programming languages out there it's been around for a really long time it's used for a ton of different applications it's used for 3d games operating systems compilers interpreters embedded systems desktop applications websites database software i could go on and list about a million things super versatile super fast programming language it's very efficient and performance optimized if you're writing any kind of code where you really care about the execution time of that code then c plus plus is a really good choice for whatever that application or code is going to be so i could go on and on about why you would want to learn c plus plus but just trust me it's a great language you're definitely going to enjoy it learning it and it's super versatile you can do a ton of stuff with it so with that said let's now dive in to the install setup steps so what i'm going to show you how to do specifically is how to install a c plus plus compiler and a code editor that you can actually write your code in so in theory you can write c plus plus code in anything you can write it in notepad you can write it in notepad plus plus you can write it in i don't know what it's called on windows like or not windows or mac whatever their default little text editor is you can write it in that you don't need like a dedicated code editor to write c plus code in however if you want to get nice syntax highlighting you want to get auto complete and some other just nice features to have when you're writing code you're going to want to install a text editor or a ide so like something like visual studio code if you don't know what that is don't worry about it in this tutorial series i'm going to be using a text editor called sublime text this is a really lightweight really minimalist text editor i really like it for doing basic tutorials and i would recommend if you're someone who's just starting out and you don't kind of know about any other text editors or ide just go with the sublime text editor it's free and you can get it from the link in the description so just download this sublime text editor and then open it up and you will now have an environment in which you can write code in now if you're on windows your install steps are going to be a little bit different than if you're on mac so if you're on mac windows or linux you need a text editor or you need something to write your code in so pick whatever that is that you want i recommend recommend sublime text for this tutorial and then if you're on mac your setup is done you actually already have a c plus compiler installed on your computer i'll show you how to access that in a minute if you're on linux same thing you already have a compiler in your system however if you're on windows you do not so you need to install one so there's this thing called ming gw not really going to get into exactly what this is but go to the link in the description download this run through the installer if you see any options just leave them completely default the only thing you should change if you want to is the install location of this program make sure when you install this you keep track of where you install it so if you installed on a different drive or something like that just make sure you know where it is because we are going to need to find the actual location of this on our on our disk or i guess on our drive so go ahead run through this install again link in the description once it's installed you need to make sure you remember where you installed okay so now that you have this installed assuming you're on windows again if you're on mac you can kind of fast forward a bit until this is done what you want to do is you want to find this program from your file explorer so open up your file explorer go to your drive i'm going to go to this pc i'm going to go to my c drive this is where i installed my program and just go and locate wherever you installed so it should be by default in your c drive in program files x86 and then you should scroll down and you should see the ming gws ming gw64 now go inside of all these folders that i'm showing you so go inside of this one go inside of the ming gw folder then go inside of bin so again this is specific if you're on windows now what you want to do is you want to get the path to this bin notice here there's all kind of executable files here these are actually a bunch of different interpreters that you can use for other programming languages or sorry not interpreters compilers so you can see g plus plus this is one that we're actually going to use for this video right here again you don't need to worry about all of this but just find this install location so if you click on your little bar here you can copy this install location so copy it to your clipboard now that you have this installed what you need to do is you need to go and modify your path variable now a path is just kind of a list of all of the locations to different executable files on your machine now the reason we need to add this right here to our path is so that we can actually use the c plus compiler from our command line you'll see how this works in a second but what you're going to type here in your windows search bar is just path now it should pop up this thing that says edit the system environment variables you want to go to a tab that looks like this again you could type in edit the system environment variables open this up what you're going to see is you have all of these different tabs go to the advanced tab go to environment variables and then you should see something that says path now when you're on path what you're going to do is you're going to press edit you're probably going to see a ton of other stuff inside of here what you want to do now is you want to add the path to this install location so whatever you just installed you want to add the path to that that's the path we just copied so we're going to press new and then we're just going to paste in that path that we have you can see i already have mine here so i'm not actually going to do this but just go ahead and paste it in so let me just remove that because i don't need it twice so once that is in there you're going to press ok and then you're going to press ok again and then if apply is able to be pressed press apply it probably won't be then you just press ok now what you've done is you've added the path to that install location so now any of those files that were in that bin you can now access them without having to type out their entire path from your command prompt so now on windows what you want to do to test that this is working is open up your command prompt and you want to type g plus plus now g plus plus is a c plus plus compiler which i will discuss in a second so you type g plus plus and just press enter if you get some type of output even if it says fatal error that's totally fine that is good if you see something that says g plus plus is not a recognized command you need to make sure you follow along with the steps i just showed you and that you added this to the path try to restart your command prompt and then boot it up again and see if this works but it should work after you go through those steps so now you should have your cbos plus compiler installed and we're ready to actually go ahead and start writing some code so at this point in time all of the mac people you can start listening again uh you will have this g plus plus compiler on your machine by default so you guys should open up your terminal you should type g plus plus in here and you should see if that works now again that just should work if you're on macro linux i don't know why that wouldn't work that should work for you and then we're kind of ready to go so now this is a good point for me to discuss what i mean by compiler because i keep saying this word compiler you've probably heard me say interpreter 2 a compiler kind of takes the source code that we write and it transcribes it or translates it into a binary executable file so by default whenever you write c plus code you can't just run that code that is just you know plain text on your computer the computer doesn't understand that so what the compiler does is it takes this code it translates it into machine language or into a binary language that a uh that your computer can actually understand and that it can run so what's going to happen is every time we write our code whenever we want to run it we're going to compile the code translate it into this new file and then this new file will have our program in a binary format we will then run that program and there we go we'll run that file that will run our program and we will be good to go so that is the difference between c plus plus and some other programming languages say like python you wouldn't have to do something like this okay so hopefully that makes sense uh that is what i mean by compiler so now what we're going to do is we're going to write our very first c plus program so you're going to open up subline text on whatever editor or whatever operating system you're using or if you're not using subline text open up your editor and create a new file now this new file you create must have a dot cpp file extension cpp stands for c plus plus so whenever you write your c plus code you're going to put it in a dot cpp file now if you're working in a text editor like sublime text as soon as you start typing you'll notice your text is going to be highlighted in different colors that kind of tells you that you're getting syntax highlighting in that this editor recognizes that the code that you're writing is c plus plus code so we will continue the tutorial in one second but i need to quickly thank the sponsor of this video and this series which is algo expert algo expert is the best platform to use for preparing for your software engineering coding interviews they have over 140 coding interview questions on the platform which are just the highest quality resources you can use to prepare for your technical coding interviews so with that said get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform so what we're going to do is write a really standard hello world program i'm not really going to explain what i'm writing just write it out here this is just the test that our environment is set up so what we're going to do is the following we're going to say include and then inside of angle brackets we're going to say io stream like that then underneath this line what we're going to type is using namespace std you might get this autocomplete if you're working in in sublime text and then we're going to put a semicolon at the end of this line a semicolon is a terminator it tells you that whatever statement you just wrote is now terminated now what these two lines are kind of doing is they're saying we're going to include a library that allows us to actually print information to the console and this namespace is going to give us access to things that are in the standard uh c plus plus library so just like pieces of syntax again you don't have to know what that means just trying to give you a bit of information now we're going to create a function we're going to say int main we're going to put two parentheses like this and then we're gonna put two curly braces and inside of here we're gonna write the following line we're gonna write c out we're gonna write these two things right here i think these are less than signs although i always mix up if they're less than or greater than you're gonna write two of these here and then you're gonna put inside of quotation marks make sure they're double quotation marks hello world exclamation point semicolon and then on the next line you're going to say return 0. now as soon as we get through a few videos here all of this will make perfect sense you will know this like the back of your hand but for right now just kind of take for granted the fact that this is going to print something out to the console and this is our very first c plus plus program all this is going to do is print this hello world so when we run this code all we're going to see is that a little bit of textures of the console that says hello so go ahead and save that control s and then what you want to do is you want to compile this file so to compile this file you need to open up your terminal or your command prompt depending on the operating system you're on and you need to navigate to the directory you're storing this file in so i've created a folder on my desktop it's called c plus plus tutorial inside i have my file tutorial1.cpp so open up your terminal open up your command prompt and you need to use the cd command which stands for change directory to get into the directory where this file is contained so a little bit of a shortcut if you're on windows here is if you just go to the directory from your file explorer like you normally would so let's go to c plus plus tutorial and then you go here so this little search bar and you delete all of this and you type cmd this will open up the command prompt in this location so notice the location is where we just where and then you're good to go so if you're on mac you're probably going to be in some directory that is not your desktop you're probably going to be in your user's home directory which means you should have something like users and then whatever your name is or something like that so what you're going to do is you're going to navigate to wherever you're storing this file so if it's on your desktop for example you're going to type cd desktop and then that's going to bring you to your desktop so let's actually just go ahead and do this ignore the two lines i just typed let's say i'm on mac and i'm in this this area i type cd desktop i go to my desktop notice now the path changes the desktop then i'm going to type cd and i'm going to go to whatever directory this file is contained in so maybe you have a folder called c plus tutorial by the way you can type the first few characters of whatever you want to go and press tab and it should auto fill it so if i do c and then tab it auto fills c tutorial so go ahead and press enter and now from here you should be good to go so just navigate using cd which stands for change directory to the directory you want to go to if you make a mistake and you need to go back type cd dot dot this will bring you back to the parent directory so we'll move you back one notice here this moves me from c swiss tutorial back to desktop anyways i have this uh command prompt open in this directory now what i'm going to do is compile my c plus file to do this i'm going to type g plus this will work on both mac and windows i'm going to type hyphen o which i believe stands for out then i'm going to type the name of the file that i want to contain the compiled code so the name of the file i want to run i'm going to call this run or i'll call this like run program or something call it whatever you want doesn't matter and then after this you're going to put the name of the file you want to compile in this case the name of my file is tutorial1 so whatever you named your file you put here and then you press enter so g plus plus hyphen o run program name of the file that contains the code you wrote dot cpp press enter you're gonna see that you're gonna get no output if you get no output that is good now what you can do is you can type this name right here that contains the kind of output file so i'm going to say run program and just press enter when you do that you should see that hello world pops up on the screen if you're on mac or linux type dot slash run program and that should work so either of them should probably work but on mac and linux i'm not sure because i haven't done this you probably need to type dot slash and that should then run the file for you but you can run this as many times as you want it contains the compiled code now just notice something here if i change this what i'm kind of printing out to the screen to just say hello and i save this file and then i go ahead and i try to run this code again so i do run program notice it's still printing hello world the reason for this is i have not recompiled my code so what i need to do to recompile my code or to get this program to now be updated with the new code i wrote is i need to compile it again so a little shortcut here if you press the up arrow on your keyboard this will cycle through the commands you've already typed so since i'm already in the same directory and i just want to compile the same file again and i want it to go to the same output file i'll just rerun this command so now that i rerun this command it should recompile my code or compile it again and now what i can do is just type the name of that program so we'll say run program and now notice it just says hello so there you go that is the basics of how to set up your machine to run c plus plus code so that is all i had for tutorial one i apologize this was a little bit slow i just want to make sure i go through every single possible edge case and thing that could go wrong so you guys can follow along and aren't getting frustrated and stuck at a ton of things you'll probably notice with my tutorials i'm very verbose i go through everything and i just want to make sure i'm giving you as much information as i can so that this is the only resource you need to go to you don't need to go and look up a million things after the video because i didn't cover them so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure you leave a
