00:00 - hey guys and welcome to a brand new
00:01 - tutorial series on Raspberry Pi now I'm
00:05 - super excited because I just got the
00:06 - brand new B+ Raspberry Pi or at least
00:09 - brand new to me what I'm gonna be doing
00:11 - through these next videos is showing you
00:13 - guys how to use this Raspberry Pi right
00:15 - some cool awesome Python programs with
00:17 - it it will allow us to interact with the
00:19 - outside world so for those of you that
00:21 - don't know this Raspberry Pi has
00:22 - something called GPIO pins let's even
00:24 - get zoomed in on here on the side right
00:26 - here and these essentially allow you
00:28 - from code to have voltage going in or
00:31 - out of them they also allow you to
00:33 - connect sensors and cameras and all that
00:35 - kind of fun stuff so what I'm gonna be
00:37 - doing throughout this series is starting
00:38 - off really basic with just how to
00:40 - trigger like an LED which is what we're
00:42 - gonna be doing in this video and then
00:43 - moving into more complex stuff like the
00:45 - Raspberry Pi camera module which I
00:48 - actually have in here and then we're
00:49 - gonna go into like a little security
00:51 - system which I'm actually building as we
00:53 - speak so anyways I hope you guys are
00:55 - excited for the series if you have any
00:56 - ideas on what you like to see with the
00:58 - Raspberry Pi please leave a comment down
01:00 - below with that being said let me reset
01:01 - up the camera and I'm gonna show you
01:03 - guys how we can set up our first circuit
01:05 - on a breadboard using the Raspberry Pi
01:07 - alright so let's go ahead and get
01:09 - started so from this point on we're
01:11 - gonna need a few things now the first
01:13 - thing I'm gonna assume is that you guys
01:14 - first of all have this Raspberry Pi and
01:16 - you've at least opened it up out of the
01:18 - box and maybe looked at it and played
01:19 - with it a little bit I'm also going to
01:21 - assume that you've installed the
01:22 - operating system on to this so this
01:24 - little SD card here at the bottom you
01:26 - guys can kind of see it there I'm
01:27 - assuming you've kind of played with that
01:29 - and assumed how to get that on so if you
01:31 - haven't done that go ahead and do that
01:32 - before following this tutorial now the
01:34 - next thing we're gonna need is we're
01:36 - gonna need a breadboard and we're gonna
01:38 - need some of these jumper cables so I
01:41 - actually have two types of cables I have
01:42 - what's known as a female thank you guys
01:45 - can see that there - male cable so this
01:47 - has a prong and no prong and this is
01:49 - going to allow us to put this on some of
01:52 - these GPIO pins and we also have male to
01:55 - male jumper wires which are what we're
01:56 - gonna use for the breadboard mainly and
01:58 - you can see that they have two prongs I
01:59 - know it's kind of blurry the way the
02:00 - camera is but hopefully you get the
02:02 - point there so make sure you guys pick
02:04 - those up you can buy them at any kind of
02:06 - electronics store or you can just get
02:07 - them off Hamazon I'll leave some links
02:09 - in the description down below so now
02:11 - what we're gonna do is we're just going
02:13 - to start
02:13 - looking up this Raspberry Pi to the
02:15 - breadboard so that when we eventually
02:17 - turn it on and start programming we
02:20 - don't have to do anything we can
02:21 - actually just work it directly with the
02:22 - code and now it's very important that
02:24 - you do this while your Raspberry Pi is
02:26 - off if you do this while your Raspberry
02:28 - Pi is on you have a very high chance of
02:30 - shorting it which is not good in most
02:33 - cases when you short your Raspberry Pi
02:35 - what's happening is essentially you're
02:37 - putting voltage into one of the ground
02:39 - pins or a pin that's not expecting that
02:41 - much voltage which means the whole board
02:43 - gets a ton of voltage on it and then it
02:45 - just shuts off now in some cases you can
02:47 - actually fry your board Raspberry Pi
02:49 - tries to avoid this by going into
02:51 - recovery mode but just you don't want to
02:53 - be in that situation so please turn this
02:55 - off before you start working with any of
02:57 - the pins now we're going to talk about
03:00 - these GPIO pins so you guys can see them
03:02 - here and what we're gonna be doing is
03:04 - working with the pins on the bottom
03:06 - right side here so right where that
03:08 - Raspberry Pi icon is and to clarify here
03:10 - I'm using the Raspberry Pi model b+
03:13 - which has 40 GPIO pins so the pins we're
03:16 - gonna be using I'm trying not to get too
03:17 - close to the camera here are gonna be on
03:19 - this side so we're actually gonna hook
03:21 - up our first wire and we're gonna hook
03:24 - up the female side to this top right pin
03:26 - or sorry bottom right pin which is gonna
03:28 - be the 5 volt pin now this is just
03:31 - always 5 volts going through it so
03:34 - obviously be careful if this is on
03:36 - because it's gonna be a live wire that
03:38 - has 5 volts going through it now the
03:40 - next cable we're gonna hook up I'm gonna
03:42 - hook up this black one is going to be
03:44 - two pins to the left of that and this is
03:46 - what's known as our ground pin so let me
03:48 - get it in and then I'll show you guys so
03:50 - right there you can see that we have one
03:51 - space and two cables like that now what
03:55 - we need essentially whenever we're
03:56 - creating a circuit is we need some kind
03:58 - of power which is going to come out of
03:59 - this and then we need some kind of
04:00 - ground now the ground is gonna be what
04:03 - completes the circuit so if you guys
04:05 - don't know that anything about
04:06 - electricity essentially you need the
04:07 - circuit to be complete like that for
04:10 - anything to actually happen otherwise it
04:12 - just doesn't work so once we've done
04:14 - that now we're actually gonna hook these
04:15 - up to our breadboard now if you look at
04:18 - the breadboard here you'll see that we
04:19 - have what's known as a positive rail and
04:21 - a negative rail so right there positive
04:23 - and negative so what we're gonna do is
04:25 - we're gonna plug in
04:26 - our positive wire which is actually
04:29 - going to be the live wire which the
04:31 - voltage is going into into any slot on
04:33 - this red rail the way that this red rail
04:35 - works is when you plug something into
04:37 - here there's a metal strip underneath it
04:39 - it attaches to all of these other holes
04:41 - so essentially anytime we plug another
04:44 - jumper wire into this red hole if this
04:47 - is giving us voltage then it's gonna get
04:49 - voltage from that as well now for ground
04:51 - we're gonna do the same thing except
04:52 - we're gonna plug it into any one on the
04:55 - negative rail right here now I'm just
04:56 - gonna plug them in beside each other but
04:58 - notice that since this line that goes
05:00 - here you can tell that this is a rail
05:02 - which means the whole thing is going to
05:03 - be charged from any two wires going like
05:06 - this now the way the bread we're
05:08 - breadboard works other than that is you
05:11 - see the rows like this so for example if
05:13 - you look at like row 10 which is right
05:16 - here you can see that what's actually
05:18 - how this works essentially is if you
05:19 - plug something into that pin all of the
05:22 - other pins in that row will get the
05:24 - charge from that you guys might not
05:26 - understand this right now but as we
05:27 - start playing with the breadboard you'll
05:28 - understand essentially the rails go like
05:31 - that and the rows go like that but do
05:34 - not go past this dividing line here so
05:37 - you can almost think this is like two
05:38 - little bread boards where this is one
05:40 - breadboard and this is the other and
05:42 - they're attached by this kind of divider
05:43 - so someone you plug in here is not gonna
05:46 - be charged on this side and you guys all
05:47 - understand that as we go through so now
05:49 - that we've done that we've plugged into
05:51 - the positive and negative rail what
05:53 - we're actually gonna do is we're gonna
05:54 - use this male to male jumper wires and
05:58 - we're gonna hook them up on these rails
06:00 - so just plug one cable in anywhere on
06:02 - the negative rail and another cable in
06:05 - anywhere on the positive rail now we're
06:08 - gonna use these to connect to our LEDs
06:10 - which I'm going to grab in just a second
06:12 - as well as a resistor so the next thing
06:15 - we're gonna need is a resistor and I'll
06:16 - be back in one second with those all
06:19 - right so I've got one of these LEDs now
06:21 - here you can see this little green LED
06:22 - it's not really focusing too well and
06:24 - what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
06:25 - plug this into the breadboard and then
06:27 - we're gonna plug in these male jumper
06:29 - wires to connect to it as well as one of
06:32 - these resistors now the reason we're
06:34 - using a resistor is because these LEDs
06:37 - don't actually use enough voltage to
06:39 - absorb
06:40 - enough voltage so you don't short your
06:42 - board so essentially what happens in a
06:44 - in a circuit is you need to have
06:46 - something using the voltage so in this
06:49 - case our LED is gonna use the voltage
06:52 - and create some kind of light and
06:54 - transform essentially those electrons
06:56 - and that energy into a source of heat
06:58 - which will be this light okay now I know
07:01 - it sounds like really science II it's
07:02 - not that complicated but essentially all
07:04 - I'm saying here is this does not
07:06 - transform enough energy which means that
07:08 - when we pass through this led too much
07:11 - current is going to be coming out of the
07:12 - LED into our Raspberry Pi here which
07:15 - means that it could possibly short so to
07:17 - be safe we're gonna use a resistor now
07:20 - the resistor that I'm using is 100 ohms
07:22 - now you don't really need to know what
07:24 - the ohms means but that's just the
07:25 - amount of resistance so just try to get
07:27 - one that's at least 50 ohms and use that
07:30 - now you can try to use it without a
07:33 - resistor and just see what happens worst
07:35 - case your board will might turn off but
07:38 - I don't think anything will actually
07:39 - happen to it like too dangerous again
07:41 - don't take my word for that but I've
07:43 - used it without a resistor and it works
07:44 - just to be safe though I like to
07:46 - recommend to people to use a resistor
07:48 - like this so what we're gonna do now is
07:50 - just start setting some things up on our
07:52 - breadboard some of these might move my
07:54 - Raspberry Pi and zoom in a little bit
07:55 - here just so we can see this a little
07:57 - bit better so what I'm gonna do is I'm
07:59 - actually going to set up my resistor so
08:01 - it goes into this negative rail so you
08:03 - can see that I'm actually plugging that
08:04 - in on that negative rail so it lines up
08:07 - with that blue wire here which is gonna
08:10 - be plugged in somewhere else and you
08:12 - guys will see where that is
08:14 - actually we can remove this blue wire my
08:16 - mistake guys we're gonna get rid of that
08:17 - blue wire and just leave the green now
08:19 - what I'm gonna do is plug in this
08:21 - resistor just anywhere else on the board
08:24 - close enough to it that it obviously fit
08:26 - so you guess you have just decide to
08:27 - plug that in and bro 21 but to make sure
08:30 - that it goes in the holes and it fits
08:32 - like that the next thing we're going to
08:33 - do is we're going to use our LED now the
08:35 - LED has to what do you call it little
08:39 - sides on it so one of them you can see
08:41 - it's not really focusing here see if I
08:43 - can get that to focus is shorter than
08:45 - the other so that shorter side is
08:47 - actually going to be I'll show you here
08:49 - again is actually going to be what ends
08:50 - up getting the the positive side or the
08:54 - and this longer side is what's going to
08:56 - be getting the voltage for us so what we
08:59 - want to do is we want to plug in so that
09:01 - this shorter side is in line with the
09:04 - resistor and this longer side and you
09:06 - can just bend it a little bit goes in
09:08 - anywhere else on the breadboard so you
09:10 - can see here now and I'll bring it up
09:12 - nice and close hopefully it focuses for
09:14 - us we go like that maybe maybe we can
09:17 - kind of see it that we're lined up
09:19 - directly with the resistor so that green
09:21 - LED is lined up with the short side with
09:23 - the resistor and the long pin is just
09:25 - plugged into one of these other holes
09:26 - what we're going to do next is we're
09:28 - going to take the the jumper wire here
09:31 - so this male-to-male and we're gonna
09:32 - plug it in so it lines up in the same
09:35 - row as the positive side or the negative
09:37 - side sorry of our LED actually it is
09:39 - positive side because it's going to be
09:41 - getting the voltage so you can see this
09:42 - green one is lined up on this rail here
09:45 - which gets voltage we're gonna go in
09:46 - here it's going to light up the LED it's
09:48 - gonna come out go into the resistor and
09:50 - then go into this orange cable here or
09:53 - so not orange this black cable here
09:54 - which is plugged in to our Raspberry Pi
09:57 - on those GPIO pins so now that we've
09:59 - done that we can actually go ahead and
10:01 - turn the Raspberry Pi on and we should
10:03 - see that our LED is lighting up so let's
10:07 - go ahead and do that and that will be
10:08 - right back
10:09 - alright so I've plugged my Raspberry Pi
10:10 - in and you can see that our LED is
10:12 - actually lighting up there so if you've
10:14 - done that correctly your LED should be
10:16 - lighting up and you should see a little
10:18 - red light on your Raspberry Pi maybe a
10:20 - green light if it's just booting up so
10:22 - that's because we're getting constant
10:24 - power from that five bullet pin so we've
10:26 - been able to turn on this LED so now
10:28 - what I'm going to show you guys how to
10:29 - do is how we can do this from code so
10:31 - all we actually need to do to modify
10:33 - this is we're first gonna unplug our
10:35 - Raspberry Pi I usually would recommend
10:37 - you shut it off before you do that but
10:38 - I'm just kind of living on the wild side
10:40 - and unplugging it and now what we're
10:42 - gonna do is move actually the pin that's
10:44 - giving us our voltage so this 5 volt pin
10:46 - we're gonna move it to a different pin
10:48 - which is known as a GPIO pin which will
10:50 - allow us to control this from code so
10:53 - what I'm gonna do now is then simply
10:54 - take out this one from that back right 5
10:57 - volt pin and what I'm gonna do is move
10:58 - it over so it's up on this top row four
11:01 - pins over and I'll zoom in on this in a
11:03 - second for you guys so you could should
11:05 - be able to see now if I can
11:07 - kiss it focus focus maybe that it's four
11:10 - pins to the left at the top so if you
11:13 - look where that ground pin is one up in
11:14 - to the left and that's what's known as
11:16 - our GPIO pin number four so now what I'm
11:19 - gonna do is actually hook up to the
11:20 - Raspberry Pi on the computer and show
11:22 - you guys how we can program to use this
11:24 - pin to turn off our LED from code so
11:28 - let's go ahead and do that now alright
11:30 - so I've booted up my Raspberry Pi I'm on
11:32 - the desktop and what I'm gonna do now is
11:33 - show you how we can actually use this
11:35 - little circuit we set up to turn on and
11:38 - off the green LED now what I just
11:40 - realized is that these GPIO pins and the
11:42 - one that we connected to give out 3.3
11:45 - volts which is pretty low and doesn't
11:48 - result in much of a light for our LED so
11:51 - if you want what you guys can do is what
11:53 - I've done and just disconnect the
11:55 - resistor I don't know if you guys can
11:57 - see this at all or not and what I've
11:58 - done is just directly hook up the LED in
12:01 - the circuit so that's actually bit of a
12:02 - challenge for you guys see if you can
12:04 - remove the resistor and still get this
12:06 - to work now if you can't put the
12:08 - resistor back in the way you had it you
12:10 - will still see the light light up it
12:11 - just won't be as bright so you can
12:13 - remove the resistor this will be safe to
12:14 - do I've just tested it myself there's no
12:16 - issues so what I'm gonna do is open up
12:18 - ideally from here from our Raspberry Pi
12:21 - and we're just gonna work in the console
12:23 - and I'm gonna show you exactly how to do
12:25 - this so we're gonna say from and this is
12:28 - just a few lines of code here GPIO 0 it
12:32 - could spell 0 correctly imports and in
12:34 - this case LED now that we've done this
12:37 - we're gonna define what GPIO pin we're
12:40 - using to turn on the LED by just saying
12:43 - green which is gonna be the name of our
12:45 - LED we're gonna say is equal to LED and
12:48 - then here we're gonna put for now just 4
12:51 - like that
12:52 - now once you do that now we can actually
12:54 - use the variable name green to turn our
12:57 - LED on and off by simply typing dot on +
13:00 - dot off so right now hopefully you guys
13:02 - can see this I'll I just have it
13:05 - hovering my LED is off now if I put and
13:08 - I hit enter here you can see that my LED
13:11 - turns on now if I want to turn it off if
13:14 - I go on the screen and I just go off
13:16 - like that and hit enter you can see that
13:19 - the LED turns off and
13:20 - can continue to just turn it on and off
13:23 - from code like this now obviously you
13:26 - guys can write this in whatever kind of
13:28 - Python code you want but that's as easy
13:29 - as it is to turn on and off the LED from
13:32 - a GPIO pin yeah if you're having any
13:34 - issues with this chances are you've
13:36 - probably hooked up your board
13:37 - incorrectly or your what do you call it
13:40 - not typing this or you're defining the
13:42 - wrong GPIO pin so go back watch make
13:45 - sure you've hooked up everything
13:46 - correctly and again a little challenge
13:48 - for you guys try to remove this resistor
13:50 - and see if you can get everything
13:50 - working if you can't put the resistor
13:52 - back try it you still will see the light
13:54 - others be very faint so with that being
13:56 - said that has been it for this video I
13:58 - hope you guys enjoyed the next videos
14:00 - we'll get more advanced and there's a
14:01 - lot of cool stuff and a me show you guys
14:02 - how to do

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on Raspberry Pi now I'm super excited because I just got the brand new B+ Raspberry Pi or at least brand new to me what I'm gonna be doing through these next videos is showing you guys how to use this Raspberry Pi right some cool awesome Python programs with it it will allow us to interact with the outside world so for those of you that don't know this Raspberry Pi has something called GPIO pins let's even get zoomed in on here on the side right here and these essentially allow you from code to have voltage going in or out of them they also allow you to connect sensors and cameras and all that kind of fun stuff so what I'm gonna be doing throughout this series is starting off really basic with just how to trigger like an LED which is what we're gonna be doing in this video and then moving into more complex stuff like the Raspberry Pi camera module which I actually have in here and then we're gonna go into like a little security system which I'm actually building as we speak so anyways I hope you guys are excited for the series if you have any ideas on what you like to see with the Raspberry Pi please leave a comment down below with that being said let me reset up the camera and I'm gonna show you guys how we can set up our first circuit on a breadboard using the Raspberry Pi alright so let's go ahead and get started so from this point on we're gonna need a few things now the first thing I'm gonna assume is that you guys first of all have this Raspberry Pi and you've at least opened it up out of the box and maybe looked at it and played with it a little bit I'm also going to assume that you've installed the operating system on to this so this little SD card here at the bottom you guys can kind of see it there I'm assuming you've kind of played with that and assumed how to get that on so if you haven't done that go ahead and do that before following this tutorial now the next thing we're gonna need is we're gonna need a breadboard and we're gonna need some of these jumper cables so I actually have two types of cables I have what's known as a female thank you guys can see that there male cable so this has a prong and no prong and this is going to allow us to put this on some of these GPIO pins and we also have male to male jumper wires which are what we're gonna use for the breadboard mainly and you can see that they have two prongs I know it's kind of blurry the way the camera is but hopefully you get the point there so make sure you guys pick those up you can buy them at any kind of electronics store or you can just get them off Hamazon I'll leave some links in the description down below so now what we're gonna do is we're just going to start looking up this Raspberry Pi to the breadboard so that when we eventually turn it on and start programming we don't have to do anything we can actually just work it directly with the code and now it's very important that you do this while your Raspberry Pi is off if you do this while your Raspberry Pi is on you have a very high chance of shorting it which is not good in most cases when you short your Raspberry Pi what's happening is essentially you're putting voltage into one of the ground pins or a pin that's not expecting that much voltage which means the whole board gets a ton of voltage on it and then it just shuts off now in some cases you can actually fry your board Raspberry Pi tries to avoid this by going into recovery mode but just you don't want to be in that situation so please turn this off before you start working with any of the pins now we're going to talk about these GPIO pins so you guys can see them here and what we're gonna be doing is working with the pins on the bottom right side here so right where that Raspberry Pi icon is and to clarify here I'm using the Raspberry Pi model b+ which has 40 GPIO pins so the pins we're gonna be using I'm trying not to get too close to the camera here are gonna be on this side so we're actually gonna hook up our first wire and we're gonna hook up the female side to this top right pin or sorry bottom right pin which is gonna be the 5 volt pin now this is just always 5 volts going through it so obviously be careful if this is on because it's gonna be a live wire that has 5 volts going through it now the next cable we're gonna hook up I'm gonna hook up this black one is going to be two pins to the left of that and this is what's known as our ground pin so let me get it in and then I'll show you guys so right there you can see that we have one space and two cables like that now what we need essentially whenever we're creating a circuit is we need some kind of power which is going to come out of this and then we need some kind of ground now the ground is gonna be what completes the circuit so if you guys don't know that anything about electricity essentially you need the circuit to be complete like that for anything to actually happen otherwise it just doesn't work so once we've done that now we're actually gonna hook these up to our breadboard now if you look at the breadboard here you'll see that we have what's known as a positive rail and a negative rail so right there positive and negative so what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug in our positive wire which is actually going to be the live wire which the voltage is going into into any slot on this red rail the way that this red rail works is when you plug something into here there's a metal strip underneath it it attaches to all of these other holes so essentially anytime we plug another jumper wire into this red hole if this is giving us voltage then it's gonna get voltage from that as well now for ground we're gonna do the same thing except we're gonna plug it into any one on the negative rail right here now I'm just gonna plug them in beside each other but notice that since this line that goes here you can tell that this is a rail which means the whole thing is going to be charged from any two wires going like this now the way the bread we're breadboard works other than that is you see the rows like this so for example if you look at like row 10 which is right here you can see that what's actually how this works essentially is if you plug something into that pin all of the other pins in that row will get the charge from that you guys might not understand this right now but as we start playing with the breadboard you'll understand essentially the rails go like that and the rows go like that but do not go past this dividing line here so you can almost think this is like two little bread boards where this is one breadboard and this is the other and they're attached by this kind of divider so someone you plug in here is not gonna be charged on this side and you guys all understand that as we go through so now that we've done that we've plugged into the positive and negative rail what we're actually gonna do is we're gonna use this male to male jumper wires and we're gonna hook them up on these rails so just plug one cable in anywhere on the negative rail and another cable in anywhere on the positive rail now we're gonna use these to connect to our LEDs which I'm going to grab in just a second as well as a resistor so the next thing we're gonna need is a resistor and I'll be back in one second with those all right so I've got one of these LEDs now here you can see this little green LED it's not really focusing too well and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna plug this into the breadboard and then we're gonna plug in these male jumper wires to connect to it as well as one of these resistors now the reason we're using a resistor is because these LEDs don't actually use enough voltage to absorb enough voltage so you don't short your board so essentially what happens in a in a circuit is you need to have something using the voltage so in this case our LED is gonna use the voltage and create some kind of light and transform essentially those electrons and that energy into a source of heat which will be this light okay now I know it sounds like really science II it's not that complicated but essentially all I'm saying here is this does not transform enough energy which means that when we pass through this led too much current is going to be coming out of the LED into our Raspberry Pi here which means that it could possibly short so to be safe we're gonna use a resistor now the resistor that I'm using is 100 ohms now you don't really need to know what the ohms means but that's just the amount of resistance so just try to get one that's at least 50 ohms and use that now you can try to use it without a resistor and just see what happens worst case your board will might turn off but I don't think anything will actually happen to it like too dangerous again don't take my word for that but I've used it without a resistor and it works just to be safe though I like to recommend to people to use a resistor like this so what we're gonna do now is just start setting some things up on our breadboard some of these might move my Raspberry Pi and zoom in a little bit here just so we can see this a little bit better so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to set up my resistor so it goes into this negative rail so you can see that I'm actually plugging that in on that negative rail so it lines up with that blue wire here which is gonna be plugged in somewhere else and you guys will see where that is actually we can remove this blue wire my mistake guys we're gonna get rid of that blue wire and just leave the green now what I'm gonna do is plug in this resistor just anywhere else on the board close enough to it that it obviously fit so you guess you have just decide to plug that in and bro 21 but to make sure that it goes in the holes and it fits like that the next thing we're going to do is we're going to use our LED now the LED has to what do you call it little sides on it so one of them you can see it's not really focusing here see if I can get that to focus is shorter than the other so that shorter side is actually going to be I'll show you here again is actually going to be what ends up getting the the positive side or the and this longer side is what's going to be getting the voltage for us so what we want to do is we want to plug in so that this shorter side is in line with the resistor and this longer side and you can just bend it a little bit goes in anywhere else on the breadboard so you can see here now and I'll bring it up nice and close hopefully it focuses for us we go like that maybe maybe we can kind of see it that we're lined up directly with the resistor so that green LED is lined up with the short side with the resistor and the long pin is just plugged into one of these other holes what we're going to do next is we're going to take the the jumper wire here so this maletomale and we're gonna plug it in so it lines up in the same row as the positive side or the negative side sorry of our LED actually it is positive side because it's going to be getting the voltage so you can see this green one is lined up on this rail here which gets voltage we're gonna go in here it's going to light up the LED it's gonna come out go into the resistor and then go into this orange cable here or so not orange this black cable here which is plugged in to our Raspberry Pi on those GPIO pins so now that we've done that we can actually go ahead and turn the Raspberry Pi on and we should see that our LED is lighting up so let's go ahead and do that and that will be right back alright so I've plugged my Raspberry Pi in and you can see that our LED is actually lighting up there so if you've done that correctly your LED should be lighting up and you should see a little red light on your Raspberry Pi maybe a green light if it's just booting up so that's because we're getting constant power from that five bullet pin so we've been able to turn on this LED so now what I'm going to show you guys how to do is how we can do this from code so all we actually need to do to modify this is we're first gonna unplug our Raspberry Pi I usually would recommend you shut it off before you do that but I'm just kind of living on the wild side and unplugging it and now what we're gonna do is move actually the pin that's giving us our voltage so this 5 volt pin we're gonna move it to a different pin which is known as a GPIO pin which will allow us to control this from code so what I'm gonna do now is then simply take out this one from that back right 5 volt pin and what I'm gonna do is move it over so it's up on this top row four pins over and I'll zoom in on this in a second for you guys so you could should be able to see now if I can kiss it focus focus maybe that it's four pins to the left at the top so if you look where that ground pin is one up in to the left and that's what's known as our GPIO pin number four so now what I'm gonna do is actually hook up to the Raspberry Pi on the computer and show you guys how we can program to use this pin to turn off our LED from code so let's go ahead and do that now alright so I've booted up my Raspberry Pi I'm on the desktop and what I'm gonna do now is show you how we can actually use this little circuit we set up to turn on and off the green LED now what I just realized is that these GPIO pins and the one that we connected to give out 3.3 volts which is pretty low and doesn't result in much of a light for our LED so if you want what you guys can do is what I've done and just disconnect the resistor I don't know if you guys can see this at all or not and what I've done is just directly hook up the LED in the circuit so that's actually bit of a challenge for you guys see if you can remove the resistor and still get this to work now if you can't put the resistor back in the way you had it you will still see the light light up it just won't be as bright so you can remove the resistor this will be safe to do I've just tested it myself there's no issues so what I'm gonna do is open up ideally from here from our Raspberry Pi and we're just gonna work in the console and I'm gonna show you exactly how to do this so we're gonna say from and this is just a few lines of code here GPIO 0 it could spell 0 correctly imports and in this case LED now that we've done this we're gonna define what GPIO pin we're using to turn on the LED by just saying green which is gonna be the name of our LED we're gonna say is equal to LED and then here we're gonna put for now just 4 like that now once you do that now we can actually use the variable name green to turn our LED on and off by simply typing dot on + dot off so right now hopefully you guys can see this I'll I just have it hovering my LED is off now if I put and I hit enter here you can see that my LED turns on now if I want to turn it off if I go on the screen and I just go off like that and hit enter you can see that the LED turns off and can continue to just turn it on and off from code like this now obviously you guys can write this in whatever kind of Python code you want but that's as easy as it is to turn on and off the LED from a GPIO pin yeah if you're having any issues with this chances are you've probably hooked up your board incorrectly or your what do you call it not typing this or you're defining the wrong GPIO pin so go back watch make sure you've hooked up everything correctly and again a little challenge for you guys try to remove this resistor and see if you can get everything working if you can't put the resistor back try it you still will see the light others be very faint so with that being said that has been it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed the next videos we'll get more advanced and there's a lot of cool stuff and a me show you guys how to do
