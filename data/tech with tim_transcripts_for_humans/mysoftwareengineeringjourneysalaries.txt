00:03 - foreign
00:08 - so I know it can be easy to look at
00:10 - LinkedIn articles and YouTube videos and
00:12 - posts about people that landed a job at
00:15 - Google or Facebook or Microsoft after
00:17 - just learning how to code six months ago
00:19 - now the reality is these people are
00:20 - anomalies this is extremely rare and
00:23 - really just not a reasonable expectation
00:25 - for any of you to have so in this video
00:27 - I want to bring you back to reality and
00:29 - share with you my career development and
00:31 - journey over really the past 10 years to
00:34 - get to the place where I'm at today now
00:35 - I am relatively young I'm only 22 years
00:37 - old however I started learning how to
00:39 - code when I was 12. I've been working
00:41 - all kinds of jobs as you're going to
00:43 - hear in this video since I was about 14.
00:45 - many of them not related to software
00:47 - engineering many of them related to
00:48 - software engineering anyways stick with
00:50 - me for this video I'm gonna bring you on
00:52 - the journey and talk to you about how I
00:54 - got to the place I'm at today so just as
00:56 - a bit of added context here in case
00:57 - you're new to the channel my name is Tim
00:59 - I currently work as the lead software
01:01 - engineer for a tech startup that I am a
01:03 - co-founder in now I am not the majority
01:06 - shareholder I was brought on about a
01:08 - year ago to kind of run the whole
01:09 - engineering department we have a few
01:11 - other developers that work with me I
01:13 - kind of manage a team of them right now
01:15 - and that's what I'm up to for most of my
01:17 - day other than filming YouTube videos
01:19 - regardless let me give you the whole
01:21 - kind of Journey until how I got to this
01:23 - point so let's go all the way back to
01:25 - 2014 where I landed my first job ever
01:28 - and this was working as an assistant for
01:30 - the company that my dad worked for which
01:32 - did high-end home automation and when I
01:34 - say high-end home automation this means
01:36 - that they're doing Lighting systems AV
01:38 - systems security systems automatic
01:41 - Shades pretty much anything that you
01:42 - could imagine kind of being required
01:45 - when you get into really big homes all
01:47 - kinds of crazy stuff worked in all kinds
01:49 - of mansions and for very very wealthy
01:51 - people regardless what I did there was
01:53 - pretty much just work as kind of like a
01:55 - grunt person I helped out on job sites
01:57 - and then I programmed Lighting systems
01:59 - which meant that if you press the keypad
02:00 - it would like turn this light on or make
02:02 - the shade go up or down super super
02:04 - basic stuff it was just pretty much the
02:05 - only job I could get because my dad got
02:07 - it for me when I was 14 years old then I
02:10 - was making about 15 an hour whatever the
02:13 - minimum wage would have been in 2014 in
02:15 - Canada and that was the first job that I
02:17 - had when I was 14. continuing in 2015 I
02:20 - started working at a summer camp now
02:22 - this summer camp was one I had been to
02:23 - many times I knew a lot of people that
02:25 - worked there already and it was very
02:27 - easy for me to get that job since I had
02:29 - been going to the summer camp for like
02:30 - years before that regardless I worked as
02:33 - a counselor and I made three hundred
02:35 - dollars a week yes 300 a week which was
02:37 - much lower than minimum wage somehow
02:39 - they can actually pay you less when you
02:41 - work for a camp regardless I wasn't
02:43 - complaining with no expenses that was
02:45 - still good money for me back when I was
02:46 - 15 years old now I continued working at
02:48 - the summer camp from 2015 to 2017 each
02:51 - year making a little bit more money but
02:52 - pretty much doing the same thing as a
02:55 - summer camp counselor so I think I made
02:56 - 300 and then I made maybe 400 a week and
03:00 - then by the time I was in my third year
03:02 - of being a counselor I probably made
03:03 - like 475 dollars a week or something
03:06 - along those lines
03:07 - then in 2017 at this point I'm 17 years
03:10 - old and in high school while I wasn't
03:12 - working in the summer I decided to pick
03:14 - up a job at McDonald's I just worked as
03:16 - a normal crew member I wasn't like a
03:18 - manager or anything like that and I made
03:20 - minimum wage worked about 15 or 20 hours
03:22 - per week and I did this just to make a
03:24 - bit of extra money while I was in school
03:26 - now keep in mind at this point in time
03:28 - I've just started my YouTube channel
03:30 - it's very much a hobby I have less than
03:32 - a thousand subscribers I'm making pretty
03:34 - much no money from it and it's just
03:36 - something I'm kind of doing for fun
03:37 - obviously I need to do other jobs if I
03:39 - want to make any kind of money and I've
03:41 - always been interested in making money
03:42 - so I was pretty much always doing any
03:44 - kind of job I could just to make a bit
03:45 - of extra cash while still focusing on
03:48 - school fun Etc alright so now in 2018
03:51 - this is when I decided to go back to the
03:54 - summer camp again this year however I
03:56 - was promoted to a stem program
03:58 - coordinator which meant that I was going
04:00 - to run a coding specialty as well as
04:03 - take care of all the STEM related
04:04 - programming at the camp so that meant
04:07 - that I was doing things like overseeing
04:09 - robotic Specialties 3D printing uh
04:11 - handling kind of third-party people or
04:13 - Freelancers that would come in and work
04:15 - for the camp and that's kind of what I
04:17 - did it was a more management role but I
04:19 - also taught kids how to program and
04:21 - that's what continued to kind of
04:22 - encourage me to work on the YouTube
04:23 - channel so I had videos that kids could
04:26 - watch after Camp
04:28 - um kind of at home and to learn more at
04:30 - this point my YouTube channel had picked
04:31 - up a little bit I had a few thousand
04:33 - subscribers I was making a little bit of
04:35 - money from that and I think uh the pay
04:37 - that I was making from being a stem
04:39 - program coordinator was like 575 dollars
04:42 - a week so I was making let's say three
04:44 - grand a month if you take you know the
04:45 - YouTube channel and you add my salary as
04:48 - a program coordinator now in 2019 I
04:51 - decided to do this again so this is when
04:53 - I was in first year university the
04:55 - YouTube channel had picked up even more
04:57 - I was probably making a few thousand
04:58 - dollars a month now from YouTube as well
05:00 - as working again in the summer as a stem
05:02 - program coordinator and this time I
05:05 - think I managed to get 750 a week after
05:08 - negotiating that salary and all of a
05:10 - sudden I was starting to make you know
05:12 - what felt like a lot of money for a 19
05:13 - year old with pretty much no expenses
05:15 - that had just entered first year
05:17 - university now at this point uh this is
05:20 - kind of where the career trajectory
05:22 - changes a bit and I go from kind of all
05:24 - these random part-time jobs to doing
05:26 - some more serious software engineering
05:28 - related work or at least coding kind of
05:30 - focused work us let me get into that now
05:32 - so in 2019 there was a portion of the
05:34 - Summer where I wasn't working for the
05:36 - summer camp and during that portion I
05:38 - worked as a junior system administrator
05:40 - again for the company that my dad worked
05:43 - for this time I was doing much more
05:44 - serious programming work where I was
05:46 - actually writing legitimate code I was
05:48 - writing a bit of code in Python I was
05:50 - writing some code in Visual Basic and I
05:52 - was doing some very kind of simple
05:53 - programming tasks and getting some
05:55 - systems to kind of integrate with each
05:57 - other just doing a little bit of
05:58 - networking stuff kind of just working in
06:00 - the tech department and had a little bit
06:03 - more you know like say trust I wouldn't
06:05 - say necessarily responsible ability but
06:07 - they were giving me more adult type
06:09 - tasks to be doing and that was the first
06:11 - kind of real let's say programming job
06:13 - that I had had so continuing from there
06:16 - in 2020 this is when my YouTube channel
06:19 - really started picking up I probably had
06:20 - about a hundred thousand subscribers and
06:22 - I started to make what was pretty much a
06:24 - full-time income from YouTube at that
06:27 - point in time was probably 40 or 50
06:29 - Grand a year that I was generating from
06:31 - YouTube now through having the YouTube
06:33 - channel I managed to get an interview at
06:35 - Microsoft this is in 2020 and I landed a
06:38 - job as a Microsoft software engineering
06:40 - intern so throughout the summer of 2020
06:42 - I worked as a Microsoft intern while I
06:45 - was working as an intern at Microsoft I
06:47 - made 10
06:48 - 290 dollars per month plus a stipend of
06:52 - 4 900 uh Canadian dollars so I made
06:55 - effectively let's say 35 000 Canadian
06:57 - dollars within three months of my
06:59 - Microsoft internship obviously that was
07:02 - insane and that was the highest income
07:04 - earning year I had so I had all the
07:05 - money from you YouTube channel which was
07:07 - like 45 50 Grand something like that
07:09 - plus all of the money from my Microsoft
07:12 - internship so I made let's say 75 000 in
07:15 - 2020. then comes 2021 in 2021 I stopped
07:20 - working at Microsoft because my YouTube
07:21 - channel was kind of just blowing up I
07:24 - continued working quite a bit on YouTube
07:25 - ended up making six figures on YouTube
07:28 - and then I started working as an
07:30 - algorithms instructor at algo Expo so at
07:33 - this point in time I had already landed
07:34 - a legitimate software engineering role I
07:37 - had some experience teaching through my
07:39 - uh kind of work at the summer camp and
07:42 - obviously I have my YouTube channel now
07:43 - which was a bit more credible I had a
07:45 - bit more um let's say substance to the
07:47 - videos and knowledge that I was sharing
07:48 - and I ended up working for algo expert
07:50 - when I worked for algo expert I
07:52 - explained data structures and algorithm
07:54 - style interview questions all of those
07:56 - are still available on the website you
07:58 - guys can check it out and after working
08:00 - as an algorithms instructor I actually
08:03 - created my own course with algo expert
08:05 - called programming expert so I did this
08:07 - course in 2021 so to kind of backtrack a
08:09 - bit here 2020 I worked for Microsoft I
08:12 - became an algorithms instructor for algo
08:14 - expert obviously this whole time I was
08:16 - running the YouTube channel then in 2021
08:18 - we created the programming expert course
08:20 - which you guys can check out from the
08:22 - link in the description and then in 2022
08:24 - with algo expert again we created the
08:26 - blockchain expert course which is for
08:28 - anyone looking to get into web 3 or
08:30 - blockchain development again you can
08:32 - check that out from the link in the
08:33 - description now just to give you a bit
08:35 - more information here because I know
08:36 - this is kind of all over the place and
08:37 - not very structured from the years of
08:40 - 2019 until kind of the middle of 2021 I
08:44 - was actually a full-time student in a
08:46 - computer science degree program I
08:48 - completed five out of eight of the
08:49 - semesters of that program before I
08:51 - decided to drop out just due to the
08:53 - other opportunities that I had but that
08:55 - is why I was working kind of summer jobs
08:57 - and I never had any full-time position
08:59 - it was because I was constantly being a
09:01 - student while running this YouTube
09:02 - channel which was pretty much a
09:04 - full-time job at that point and then
09:06 - doing any kind of Summer gig that I
09:07 - would take on so it wasn't until 2021
09:10 - that I was able to really fully commit
09:12 - to doing things like being an algorithms
09:14 - instructor creating this programming
09:16 - expert in blockchain expert course and
09:18 - then of course running the YouTube
09:19 - channel which obviously at this point is
09:21 - doing quite well and that I'm going to
09:22 - continue to do for the foreseeable
09:24 - future now though I'll also mention that
09:26 - in 2022 is when I became the lead
09:29 - software engineer for this Tech startup
09:30 - so about a year and two months ago from
09:33 - filming this video I was approached by
09:35 - the current founder of our company who
09:37 - asked me if I wanted to come on and
09:39 - leave the engineering team obviously
09:40 - this was the biggest kind of engineering
09:42 - role I could possibly take on this was
09:44 - going to be the most amount of
09:45 - responsibility the most amount of stuff
09:47 - that I needed to learn and just
09:48 - something that I hadn't done before to
09:50 - be honest I probably wasn't qualified to
09:52 - be a senior software engineer here at
09:54 - this company but I took on the role I
09:57 - said you know what I'm gonna figure it
09:58 - out I'm gonna deal with it and that's
09:59 - what I've done today now after taking on
10:01 - that and working for about a year
10:03 - programming pretty much every single day
10:05 - on a really large scale project I feel
10:07 - way more confident and way better in my
10:09 - programming skills and I'm going to
10:11 - continue to do that so I'm super super
10:13 - happy I took that position obviously it
10:15 - was very intimidating when I first kind
10:17 - of got brought on and was just expected
10:19 - to run all of this stuff but I figured
10:21 - it out and yeah there you go so I know
10:24 - that this video is kind of all over the
10:26 - place but what I wanted to show with
10:28 - this video is that everyone has a
10:30 - different Journey when it comes to being
10:31 - a developer or Landing some kind of
10:33 - software engineering job for me mine was
10:36 - kind of all over the place I've been
10:37 - programming for 10 years yet I've only
10:39 - really been working as a software
10:40 - engineer for say the past four years a
10:43 - lot of my experience as a software
10:44 - engineer is simply self-taught it's
10:46 - through making YouTube videos it's
10:48 - through teaching you guys it's through
10:49 - making courses and experimenting and
10:51 - kind of teaming up with other
10:52 - programmers around the internet I
10:55 - haven't had a ton of formal software
10:56 - engineering experience yet I'd still say
10:59 - I'm a pretty competent programmer and
11:00 - obviously you guys can judge that for
11:02 - yourself when you watch my YouTube
11:03 - videos go through my courses and see the
11:05 - kind of apps that I'm building and that
11:07 - I'll release and share with you guys
11:08 - later in the year uh and kind of you
11:11 - know give you updates as we go along in
11:13 - terms of what the future holds I have no
11:15 - idea I'm going to continue working for
11:17 - this Tech startup I'm going to be making
11:18 - a few other really awesome courses and
11:20 - teaming up with some company so look
11:22 - forward to that and with that said I
11:24 - think I'm going to wrap up the video
11:26 - here a reminder if you want to become a
11:28 - software engineer check out
11:29 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
11:31 - the description you can also check out
11:32 - blockchain expert if you're into web 3
11:34 - and blockchain development with that
11:36 - said I'll wrap it up I hope you guys
11:37 - enjoyed if you did leave a like
11:39 - subscribe and I will see you in the next
11:41 - one

Cleaned transcript:

foreign so I know it can be easy to look at LinkedIn articles and YouTube videos and posts about people that landed a job at Google or Facebook or Microsoft after just learning how to code six months ago now the reality is these people are anomalies this is extremely rare and really just not a reasonable expectation for any of you to have so in this video I want to bring you back to reality and share with you my career development and journey over really the past 10 years to get to the place where I'm at today now I am relatively young I'm only 22 years old however I started learning how to code when I was 12. I've been working all kinds of jobs as you're going to hear in this video since I was about 14. many of them not related to software engineering many of them related to software engineering anyways stick with me for this video I'm gonna bring you on the journey and talk to you about how I got to the place I'm at today so just as a bit of added context here in case you're new to the channel my name is Tim I currently work as the lead software engineer for a tech startup that I am a cofounder in now I am not the majority shareholder I was brought on about a year ago to kind of run the whole engineering department we have a few other developers that work with me I kind of manage a team of them right now and that's what I'm up to for most of my day other than filming YouTube videos regardless let me give you the whole kind of Journey until how I got to this point so let's go all the way back to 2014 where I landed my first job ever and this was working as an assistant for the company that my dad worked for which did highend home automation and when I say highend home automation this means that they're doing Lighting systems AV systems security systems automatic Shades pretty much anything that you could imagine kind of being required when you get into really big homes all kinds of crazy stuff worked in all kinds of mansions and for very very wealthy people regardless what I did there was pretty much just work as kind of like a grunt person I helped out on job sites and then I programmed Lighting systems which meant that if you press the keypad it would like turn this light on or make the shade go up or down super super basic stuff it was just pretty much the only job I could get because my dad got it for me when I was 14 years old then I was making about 15 an hour whatever the minimum wage would have been in 2014 in Canada and that was the first job that I had when I was 14. continuing in 2015 I started working at a summer camp now this summer camp was one I had been to many times I knew a lot of people that worked there already and it was very easy for me to get that job since I had been going to the summer camp for like years before that regardless I worked as a counselor and I made three hundred dollars a week yes 300 a week which was much lower than minimum wage somehow they can actually pay you less when you work for a camp regardless I wasn't complaining with no expenses that was still good money for me back when I was 15 years old now I continued working at the summer camp from 2015 to 2017 each year making a little bit more money but pretty much doing the same thing as a summer camp counselor so I think I made 300 and then I made maybe 400 a week and then by the time I was in my third year of being a counselor I probably made like 475 dollars a week or something along those lines then in 2017 at this point I'm 17 years old and in high school while I wasn't working in the summer I decided to pick up a job at McDonald's I just worked as a normal crew member I wasn't like a manager or anything like that and I made minimum wage worked about 15 or 20 hours per week and I did this just to make a bit of extra money while I was in school now keep in mind at this point in time I've just started my YouTube channel it's very much a hobby I have less than a thousand subscribers I'm making pretty much no money from it and it's just something I'm kind of doing for fun obviously I need to do other jobs if I want to make any kind of money and I've always been interested in making money so I was pretty much always doing any kind of job I could just to make a bit of extra cash while still focusing on school fun Etc alright so now in 2018 this is when I decided to go back to the summer camp again this year however I was promoted to a stem program coordinator which meant that I was going to run a coding specialty as well as take care of all the STEM related programming at the camp so that meant that I was doing things like overseeing robotic Specialties 3D printing uh handling kind of thirdparty people or Freelancers that would come in and work for the camp and that's kind of what I did it was a more management role but I also taught kids how to program and that's what continued to kind of encourage me to work on the YouTube channel so I had videos that kids could watch after Camp um kind of at home and to learn more at this point my YouTube channel had picked up a little bit I had a few thousand subscribers I was making a little bit of money from that and I think uh the pay that I was making from being a stem program coordinator was like 575 dollars a week so I was making let's say three grand a month if you take you know the YouTube channel and you add my salary as a program coordinator now in 2019 I decided to do this again so this is when I was in first year university the YouTube channel had picked up even more I was probably making a few thousand dollars a month now from YouTube as well as working again in the summer as a stem program coordinator and this time I think I managed to get 750 a week after negotiating that salary and all of a sudden I was starting to make you know what felt like a lot of money for a 19 year old with pretty much no expenses that had just entered first year university now at this point uh this is kind of where the career trajectory changes a bit and I go from kind of all these random parttime jobs to doing some more serious software engineering related work or at least coding kind of focused work us let me get into that now so in 2019 there was a portion of the Summer where I wasn't working for the summer camp and during that portion I worked as a junior system administrator again for the company that my dad worked for this time I was doing much more serious programming work where I was actually writing legitimate code I was writing a bit of code in Python I was writing some code in Visual Basic and I was doing some very kind of simple programming tasks and getting some systems to kind of integrate with each other just doing a little bit of networking stuff kind of just working in the tech department and had a little bit more you know like say trust I wouldn't say necessarily responsible ability but they were giving me more adult type tasks to be doing and that was the first kind of real let's say programming job that I had had so continuing from there in 2020 this is when my YouTube channel really started picking up I probably had about a hundred thousand subscribers and I started to make what was pretty much a fulltime income from YouTube at that point in time was probably 40 or 50 Grand a year that I was generating from YouTube now through having the YouTube channel I managed to get an interview at Microsoft this is in 2020 and I landed a job as a Microsoft software engineering intern so throughout the summer of 2020 I worked as a Microsoft intern while I was working as an intern at Microsoft I made 10 290 dollars per month plus a stipend of 4 900 uh Canadian dollars so I made effectively let's say 35 000 Canadian dollars within three months of my Microsoft internship obviously that was insane and that was the highest income earning year I had so I had all the money from you YouTube channel which was like 45 50 Grand something like that plus all of the money from my Microsoft internship so I made let's say 75 000 in 2020. then comes 2021 in 2021 I stopped working at Microsoft because my YouTube channel was kind of just blowing up I continued working quite a bit on YouTube

2021 so to kind of backtrack a bit here 2020 I worked for Microsoft I became an algorithms instructor for algo expert obviously this whole time I was running the YouTube channel then in 2021 we created the programming expert course which you guys can check out from the link in the description and then in 2022 with algo expert again we created the blockchain expert course which is for anyone looking to get into web 3 or blockchain development again you can check that out from the link in the description now just to give you a bit more information here because I know this is kind of all over the place and not very structured from the years of 2019 until kind of the middle of 2021 I was actually a fulltime student in a computer science degree program I completed five out of eight of the semesters of that program before I decided to drop out just due to the other opportunities that I had but that is why I was working kind of summer jobs and I never had any fulltime position it was because I was constantly being a student while running this YouTube channel which was pretty much a fulltime job at that point and then doing any kind of Summer gig that I would take on so it wasn't until 2021 that I was able to really fully commit to doing things like being an algorithms instructor creating this programming expert in blockchain expert course and then of course running the YouTube channel which obviously at this point is doing quite well and that I'm going to continue to do for the foreseeable future now though I'll also mention that in 2022 is when I became the lead software engineer for this Tech startup so about a year and two months ago from filming this video I was approached by the current founder of our company who asked me if I wanted to come on and leave the engineering team obviously this was the biggest kind of engineering role I could possibly take on this was going to be the most amount of responsibility the most amount of stuff that I needed to learn and just something that I hadn't done before to be honest I probably wasn't qualified to be a senior software engineer here at this company but I took on the role I said you know what I'm gonna figure it out I'm gonna deal with it and that's what I've done today now after taking on that and working for about a year programming pretty much every single day on a really large scale project I feel way more confident and way better in my programming skills and I'm going to continue to do that so I'm super super happy I took that position obviously it was very intimidating when I first kind of got brought on and was just expected to run all of this stuff but I figured it out and yeah there you go so I know that this video is kind of all over the place but what I wanted to show with this video is that everyone has a different Journey when it comes to being a developer or Landing some kind of software engineering job for me mine was kind of all over the place I've been programming for 10 years yet I've only really been working as a software engineer for say the past four years a lot of my experience as a software engineer is simply selftaught it's through making YouTube videos it's through teaching you guys it's through making courses and experimenting and kind of teaming up with other programmers around the internet I haven't had a ton of formal software engineering experience yet I'd still say I'm a pretty competent programmer and obviously you guys can judge that for yourself when you watch my YouTube videos go through my courses and see the kind of apps that I'm building and that I'll release and share with you guys later in the year uh and kind of you know give you updates as we go along in terms of what the future holds I have no idea I'm going to continue working for this Tech startup I'm going to be making a few other really awesome courses and teaming up with some company so look forward to that and with that said I think I'm going to wrap up the video here a reminder if you want to become a software engineer check out programmingexpert.io from the link in the description you can also check out blockchain expert if you're into web 3 and blockchain development with that said I'll wrap it up I hope you guys enjoyed if you did leave a like subscribe and I will see you in the next one foreign
