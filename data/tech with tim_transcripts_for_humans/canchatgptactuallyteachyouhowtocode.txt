00:00 - it's no secret that chat GPT is pretty
00:02 - impressive but can it actually teach you
00:04 - to code entirely on its own well today
00:07 - I'm going to put that to the test using
00:09 - just chat GPT I'm going to attempt to
00:11 - learn the C programming language now
00:13 - even though I do have some experien
00:14 - programming I'm going to act like a
00:16 - complete beginner and I'm only going to
00:18 - do exactly what Chad GPT tells me to be
00:20 - honest with you I have no idea how this
00:22 - is going to go so stick around to find
00:24 - out now let's just be honest here if you
00:26 - want to attempt this on your own you're
00:27 - going to need to know a bit about how
00:29 - chat gbt actually works now fortunately
00:32 - HubSpot has a great free resource called
00:34 - using chat GPT at work which breaks down
00:36 - exactly how to use chat gbt as
00:38 - effectively as possible it's a bundle
00:40 - that gives you a comprehensive overview
00:42 - of how the tool works it also gives you
00:44 - some best practices and expert insights
00:47 - now I've left a link to it in the
00:48 - description and you can check it out
00:49 - completely for free this guide contains
00:51 - a decision flowchart templates for set
00:53 - and clear guidelines an AI generated
00:56 - content refinement guide and even an AI
00:58 - adoption checklist it really breaks down
01:00 - how to best utilize this tool and make
01:03 - the most of its capabilities to increase
01:05 - your efficiency and your processes and
01:07 - if that wasn't enough there's over a 100
01:09 - prompts that you can start using
01:10 - immediately personally my favorite part
01:12 - of this resource is the guide that shows
01:14 - you how to supercharge your workday with
01:16 - chat gbt which is a game Cher for daily
01:19 - productivity this resource and tons of
01:21 - others are provided for free by HubSpot
01:23 - a massive thank you to them for making
01:25 - all of this available and for sponsoring
01:27 - today's video so first things first
01:29 - we're going to need some kind of plan or
01:31 - road mapap I don't really know anything
01:32 - about C or how you're supposed to learn
01:34 - it so let's see if chat GPT can help us
01:37 - with
01:41 - that okay so I just asked it hey I'm
01:43 - looking to learn the C programming
01:45 - language act as though I'm a complete
01:47 - beginner and give me a road map or guide
01:49 - on how I can learn this language so this
01:51 - is pretty straightforward but let's see
01:52 - what it gives us for this and I want
01:54 - kind of my goal for this video to be to
01:56 - create an entire project using C and
01:59 - again I'm just going to do whatever chat
02:01 - GPT tells me I'm going to act as though
02:03 - I'm a beginner and I'm just going to
02:05 - follow along with all of its
02:06 - instructions and see if with good
02:08 - prompting it will actually get me in the
02:10 - right direction and we can kind of
02:11 - achieve that
02:18 - goal so it's giv me a bit of a road map
02:21 - here but as I'm reading through this
02:23 - it's extremely vague for example you
02:25 - know what is programming basic computer
02:27 - architecture how computers understand
02:29 - and run programs mean I don't know if we
02:31 - really need to learn that to understand
02:32 - C I install a c compiler okay that's
02:35 - good it's giving me a few options here
02:37 - but it doesn't say how I'm able to write
02:40 - compile use the compiler what a compiler
02:42 - is learn the syntax and basic concepts
02:45 - okay I guess that's good dive into more
02:47 - complex topics overall it's super super
02:49 - vague and it's not really giving me any
02:51 - actionable things to actually do so I'm
02:54 - going to try again and ask it to adjust
02:56 - it to kind of like a checklist of topics
02:58 - so I have something a little a little
02:59 - bit better to follow along with because
03:01 - right now if I was a complete beginner
03:03 - and I just had this I would already be
03:06 - pretty
03:12 - lost all right so I just asked it to
03:15 - revise this and give me a list of topics
03:17 - in some logical order so that I can kind
03:18 - of follow along with those step by step
03:21 - I think that's a little bit easier and
03:22 - then we can just tackle each step at a
03:24 - time so let's get it to finish this list
03:27 - here and then we can start learning
03:28 - these in this order all right so that is
03:30 - a much better list here and what I've
03:32 - done is I've just taken it and put it
03:34 - here in a Google doc just so it's a bit
03:36 - easier for me to follow along and keep
03:37 - track of my progress so what I'm going
03:39 - to do is just go through this step by
03:41 - step let's begin by seeing if chat GPT
03:43 - can show me how to accurately set up a
03:46 - compiler and how to use that and kind of
03:48 - get started on my
03:55 - computer okay so next step we're going
03:57 - to get set up with our C program
03:59 - programming environment so I just asked
04:01 - it to walk me through that and assume
04:02 - that I'm a complete beginner now it
04:04 - tells me there's different steps Windows
04:06 - Mac Etc on Mac it says open the terminal
04:09 - type this follow the onscreen
04:11 - instructions so let's copy this command
04:13 - here now we'll assume that we already
04:15 - know how to open the terminal but if
04:16 - you're a complete beginner you may not
04:17 - even know how to do that or what the
04:19 - terminal is however I'll bring the
04:21 - terminal open on the right side of my
04:23 - screen let's paste that in and move this
04:25 - to the left and let's see what we get it
04:28 - says xcode select error command line
04:30 - tools are already installed okay so I'm
04:32 - going to copy this and ask chat jbt what
04:34 - to do about that because if I was a
04:36 - beginner I may not actually know and
04:37 - also I'm assuming that for this command
04:39 - to work you need xcode to be installed
04:41 - which I already have installed if you
04:43 - didn't have it installed I think this
04:45 - probably wouldn't work and already you
04:47 - would be stuck so I'll just say hey I'm
04:52 - getting this error in the terminal can
04:57 - you help me okay so let's see what it
04:59 - says about this so it pretty much told
05:01 - me here that this is good news because
05:03 - it means I already have them installed
05:04 - so I'm going to skip the rest of the
05:06 - steps here but the fact that is giving
05:07 - me all these new commands again that
05:09 - could be confusing for a beginner who
05:11 - might just want to copy and paste
05:12 - everything that's inside of here anyways
05:14 - I know that these are already working so
05:16 - that's fine so let's move on to step two
05:18 - which says choose and set up a text
05:20 - editor or IDE so it says vs code go to
05:22 - visual studio code website and download
05:24 - the installer okay I've already done
05:25 - that run the installer and then install
05:28 - the extension so let's open up vs code
05:30 - and install that extension so vs code is
05:32 - open here obviously I know how to use
05:34 - this but as a complete beginner I would
05:35 - assume that you would have no idea what
05:37 - this tool is how you use it or even what
05:39 - an extension is or how to install that
05:41 - so let's ask chat gbt how to install the
05:44 - extension how do I install the C C+
05:49 - extension in vs
05:51 - code remember I've never used this
05:56 - before let's see what it gives us with
05:58 - that all right so fortunately it's giv
06:00 - me some pretty good instructions here
06:02 - and it tells me how to access the
06:03 - extension View and then to search for
06:05 - this extension so let's go ahead and do
06:07 - that c/
06:09 - C++ okay by Microsoft let's go ahead and
06:12 - install that so the extension is
06:14 - installed let's go on to the next step
06:16 - here which is to write compile and run a
06:18 - simple program so we're going to create
06:20 - a new file let's assume that we can
06:21 - figure that out so let's go here and
06:23 - make a new file we're going to save this
06:25 - as
06:26 - hello.c okay I'll just replace I was
06:28 - doing this for let's copy this code and
06:32 - paste it inside of here so now it says
06:34 - to compile our program we're going to
06:36 - need to open up the terminal and we're
06:37 - going to type the following command so
06:40 - Mac OS okay let's copy that now I'm
06:44 - going to go through this as if I know
06:46 - how this works but I know for many
06:47 - beginners first of all they're not going
06:49 - to understand you actually need to save
06:50 - this file which I just did they're not
06:52 - going to know how to open or create a
06:54 - new file and they're not going to know
06:55 - how to open up the terminal or the
06:57 - command prompt with inv vs code or
06:58 - navigate to the correct directory so
07:00 - it's skipping over a ton of different
07:02 - steps for the purpose of this video and
07:03 - not to drag it on I'll just go with how
07:05 - I know how to actually do it but for 90%
07:08 - of people that are just starting out
07:09 - there's no way they're going to be able
07:10 - to follow this uh without some more
07:12 - detailed instruction or knowing to ask
07:14 - the right questions so anyways let's
07:16 - type this here and see if that actually
07:18 - works okay so it looks like it did
07:21 - however I didn't get any output so what
07:23 - does it say here run your program after
07:25 - the compilation type do /hello
07:28 - okay and are we going to get some output
07:30 - here we did we got hello world okay so
07:32 - Step One is complete we've been able to
07:34 - write our first program so let's check
07:36 - that one off the list here let me just
07:38 - make this green let's move on to step
07:41 - number
07:54 - two all right so as we move on to step
07:56 - two here I'm realizing there's going to
07:58 - be a lot of prompts and a lot of output
08:00 - so in the nature of not boring you I'm
08:01 - going to fast forward through quite a
08:03 - bit of this go through these steps on my
08:05 - own and we'll see how far I can get
08:06 - without any significant
08:19 - issues so I've got to a point here where
08:21 - I'm asking it about operators and
08:24 - already I'm noticing a huge issue that I
08:27 - think I'm going to keep running into as
08:28 - I go through this so I've just asked it
08:30 - to explain to me the basic operators
08:32 - which was this step in my road map and
08:34 - as I've done that here it started
08:36 - throwing me a bunch of code that I've
08:38 - never seen before and it's not really
08:40 - building upon what we had before for
08:42 - example now we're doing a comma so like
08:44 - multiple variables in the same line it
08:46 - doesn't explain that I'm not sure what
08:47 - that is we're doing a declaration
08:49 - without actually assigning a value and
08:51 - now we're even using IF statements and
08:54 - we're evaluating the results of
08:55 - different conditions and it hasn't
08:57 - talked about that at all so yeah it's
08:59 - intuitive I guess what's going on but as
09:01 - a complete beginner I have so many
09:03 - questions I guess I could ask chat GPT
09:05 - that but ideally it shouldn't be showing
09:07 - me a bunch of code that I've never seen
09:09 - before already so early in my
09:22 - journey so we've moved over here to scan
09:24 - F and getting user input however I keep
09:27 - running into the same issue with Chachi
09:29 - where it's throwing a lot of stuff at me
09:31 - that it hasn't explained at all for
09:33 - example we're looking at character
09:35 - arrays which I guess in CR strings I
09:37 - don't even know because it hasn't
09:39 - explained that we're looking at using
09:41 - this Ampersand which is getting the
09:43 - pointer or the address of this variable
09:45 - now I've asked it some questions about
09:47 - that but the same issue keeps popping up
09:49 - where it keeps throwing really complex
09:51 - explanations using a ton of terms that I
09:54 - just know many beginners wouldn't
09:56 - understand obviously I can understand
09:57 - most of this because I know how to code
09:59 - already but even some of the things it's
10:00 - mentioning to me an experienced
10:02 - programmer are quite confusing and
10:04 - really overwhelming so I'm going to
10:06 - change my prompt style a little bit and
10:07 - see if I can get it to give me kind of
10:09 - little Snippets of information so I can
10:11 - work through it a bit slower and not get
10:13 - overwhelmed with so much
10:26 - code all right so I've adjusted my
10:28 - prompting style a bit and I've told it
10:30 - to really focus on giving me bits of
10:32 - information and then asking me if I
10:35 - understand it before we proceed now it's
10:37 - kind of done that it's definitely doing
10:38 - a better job now and let me show you
10:40 - kind of the output that I'm getting so
10:42 - it gives me a small bit of information
10:44 - quick example a little bit of an
10:45 - explanation and then it tells me okay
10:47 - try this so some kind of exercise which
10:49 - is definitely better than what we had
10:51 - before and then it also asks me if it's
10:53 - good and if we can move forward to the
10:55 - next step now I don't like the fact that
10:57 - it just automatically gives the next
10:59 - next piece of information I'm sure I can
11:00 - tell it not to do that but at least it's
11:03 - giving me little logical sections that I
11:05 - can read and Approach at once this is
11:07 - significantly better than what I had
11:09 - before what I'm realizing already is
11:10 - that you have to be really really
11:12 - detailed with the way you ask chat GPT
11:15 - and even within a lot of these
11:16 - explanations for example we get into
11:18 - things like a switch statement it talks
11:20 - about a fall through so where's that
11:22 - yeah from falling through the next case
11:24 - but it doesn't explain what that is so
11:26 - in anytime you see information that
11:27 - hasn't yet been explained you have to
11:29 - ask it to elaborate which is what I did
11:31 - with the switch statement so explain
11:32 - fall through and then it will give you a
11:34 - really good explanation but you can't
11:36 - really rely on it to explain all little
11:39 - details you would need to understand to
11:41 - get good at
11:56 - program so just to give you quick update
11:58 - on my progress here I've made it all the
12:01 - way up to recursion so I've just learned
12:03 - of a functions now I'm doing recursion
12:05 - honestly I don't love the order in which
12:07 - it's giving me all these things this is
12:08 - not how I would teach this if I was
12:10 - going to teach to complete beginners but
12:11 - we're using chat GPT and we're following
12:13 - along with what it says so we've just
12:15 - written a Fibonacci function we just
12:17 - looked at what was the other one it
12:19 - showed us um calculating a factorial
12:22 - it's getting us into even some algorithm
12:24 - type stuff already before we even
12:26 - understand things like arrays or other
12:28 - compon components within programming but
12:30 - we're following along with it so let's
12:32 - see how far we
12:44 - get so another small note for you guys
12:47 - I'm looking at pre-processor directives
12:49 - which to me seems like a pretty
12:51 - complicated thing quite early in my
12:53 - learning uh anyways as I've gone through
12:56 - here it's shown me a few examples for
12:57 - example like using the this if L if else
13:00 - so I just assumed okay I can just you
13:01 - know throw this outside of my program
13:03 - right like I can just put it up here and
13:05 - say if debug print something out but
13:07 - that started giving me an error so trap
13:09 - gbt was able to fix that error for me it
13:10 - told me why I was getting that issue
13:12 - what I'm really noticing is that it's
13:14 - not being very specific and it's not
13:16 - explaining any prerequisites where I
13:19 - need to put the code it's just kind of
13:20 - assuming that I'm going to figure it out
13:22 - so in this area where this is something
13:24 - that I've actually never seen before
13:25 - I've never used it already I was a
13:27 - little bit confused on where I use this
13:29 - why I use it how I would actually end up
13:31 - using it yeah I can figure it out but
13:33 - it's taking me a little bit longer just
13:35 - because it's kind of misguiding me are
13:37 - giving me some information that's not
13:38 - really in the correct
13:48 - context so it's been a few hours now
13:50 - I've been messing with C I've been
13:52 - learning with chat jbt I did some
13:54 - exercises I did a few mini projects and
13:56 - I feel somewhat comfortable with the
13:58 - link which I've learned some of the new
13:59 - features like the pre-processor
14:01 - directives structures dynamic memory
14:04 - address allocation macros all those
14:06 - kinds of things however the order in
14:08 - which I was taught it was definitely
14:09 - very strange and I had a lot of uh kind
14:12 - of bumps and issues while I was trying
14:14 - to learn these topics so at this point
14:16 - what I want to do is share with you what
14:17 - worked well here what didn't work at all
14:20 - and what my tips and general advices for
14:22 - using chat GPT to learn a language or to
14:24 - learn really any programming concept so
14:26 - first of all let's just get this out of
14:28 - the way the only reason I was somewhat
14:30 - successful here and could learn even
14:31 - some of these new C features is because
14:33 - I already know how to program I'm a very
14:36 - experienced developer I've worked in
14:37 - many different programming languages
14:39 - I've seen a lot of these features before
14:41 - or at least similar features with
14:42 - different maybe syntax and that's why I
14:45 - was able to pretty quickly learn a lot
14:47 - of these new topics however I can tell
14:49 - you as someone who teaches a lot of
14:50 - beginner programmers this skips so many
14:53 - prerequisites assumes so much knowledge
14:56 - and really very quickly jumps you into a
14:59 - lot of advanced topics without obviously
15:01 - knowing if you understand them or even
15:03 - breaking down the fundamental concepts
15:05 - that allow you to understand those so
15:07 - yes for me this was okay for someone
15:08 - who's an experienced developer sure you
15:10 - can learn in this format but if you're a
15:12 - complete beginner and you're using
15:13 - something like chat GPT there's no
15:15 - chance that you're going to be able to
15:17 - pick up everything you need to actually
15:19 - move on to those more advanced topics
15:21 - and not get overwhelmed and confused now
15:23 - with all that in mind let me share with
15:24 - you what I think this is actually really
15:26 - good at so the First Advantage that I
15:28 - found is that this is extremely fast I
15:30 - don't think I've ever learned stuff as
15:32 - quickly as using something like chat GPT
15:34 - and that's simply because I'm already
15:36 - experienced enough that I don't need
15:37 - like a long drawn out explanation I
15:40 - don't need to watch a whole video or a
15:42 - long tutorial series I can just
15:43 - instantly ask a question and get the
15:45 - answer very very fast so that's the
15:48 - first thing that I appreciated it's just
15:49 - super quick it spits out anything that I
15:52 - want immediately and it's a single
15:54 - source that I'm using I don't need to go
15:56 - and look at all these different
15:57 - resources online I don't need to find a
15:59 - really good course or curriculum I don't
16:01 - need to scan through documentation and
16:03 - with that in mind even if it doesn't
16:05 - give me what I'm looking for right away
16:07 - I know how to adjust the prompt in the
16:09 - question to get what I want so I can ask
16:11 - it to give me a different example to
16:13 - give me a code snippet to copy in to
16:16 - walk through the code line by line if I
16:17 - have a question or a doubt there's an
16:19 - area that I don't understand I can
16:21 - immediately have that solved and have a
16:23 - new explanation or a new example whereas
16:26 - if I was using something like a course
16:27 - or document ation whatever is there is
16:30 - all that I have access to yes I can go
16:32 - search for something else but that's
16:33 - going to take me quite a bit longer and
16:35 - jumping between 10 15 20 different
16:37 - resources just isn't efficient and it's
16:39 - going to kind of lead you along like a
16:41 - path where you're just going back and
16:42 - forth zigzagging and finding all
16:45 - different kinds of information from all
16:46 - different kinds of people so that's what
16:48 - I really appreciated here just the speed
16:49 - at which I can get information all I
16:52 - have to do is just come up with a decent
16:54 - question and then I can really focus in
16:55 - on one area and get any doubter question
16:58 - question I have answered immediately now
17:00 - with that in mind let's talk about all
17:02 - of the negatives so if you are someone
17:03 - who doesn't really know where to start
17:05 - you don't already have a curriculum or a
17:07 - road map and you go to chat GPT you're
17:09 - going to be brought in so many different
17:11 - directions and it's not really going to
17:14 - guide you very well on what you should
17:15 - learn and in what order we saw already
17:18 - here that I asked it for two different
17:19 - versions of a road map for learning C
17:22 - they had some good topics but the order
17:24 - was really weird it's a non order that I
17:26 - personally would ever recommend for
17:27 - learning a l anguage it was showing me
17:29 - some Advanced features after I just
17:31 - learned about if statements or functions
17:34 - for example we're getting into recursion
17:36 - before we even talk about arrays or
17:37 - strings or we've even ridden a sampled
17:39 - program it's showing me memory addressed
17:41 - pointers and all these Advanced features
17:43 - and assuming that I know them when I've
17:45 - never even written code before at least
17:47 - that's what I was trying to simulate so
17:49 - it was just a really backwards order and
17:51 - kind of a weird way of going through
17:52 - things and you can't rely on that being
17:55 - a good curriculum I think for me that
17:56 - was the biggest realization is that yes
17:58 - it's giving me something that seems good
18:00 - in the moment but if I was someone who's
18:02 - never done this before I wouldn't really
18:04 - want to rely on this and I wouldn't know
18:06 - if it was actually guiding me in the
18:08 - correct direction so it's one of those
18:09 - things where it kind of speaks with
18:11 - complete confidence says yeah this is
18:12 - what you need to do so it seems like the
18:15 - right thing but when you know better you
18:16 - realize that you can't rely on a lot of
18:18 - the information that's being provided to
18:20 - you so with that in mind what you would
18:21 - really need to do is go find some
18:23 - curriculum that's solid that's vetted
18:25 - that a lot of people have followed
18:26 - through with or from a reputable source
18:28 - take that and then use that to kind of
18:30 - guide your journey in chat gbt where you
18:33 - could focus in on more specific topics
18:35 - now even Within These topics though what
18:37 - I realized is that chat GPT is very bad
18:40 - when it comes to assuming knowledge even
18:42 - when I explicitly told it to treat me
18:44 - like a complete beginner that had no
18:46 - prior experience it still assumed that I
18:48 - had software installed that I knew how
18:50 - to navigate my computer that I knew what
18:51 - different programs were I know how to
18:53 - save files open files how to get to the
18:56 - terminal there's just all these
18:57 - different things that you might not
18:58 - think about now as an experienced
19:00 - developer when you're starting out there
19:01 - are huge roadblocks and they're really
19:03 - frustrating so overall the biggest
19:05 - issues I found is that it can be really
19:07 - vague if you don't direct it exactly on
19:09 - what you want it really assumes quite a
19:12 - bit of knowledge that you may or may not
19:14 - actually know and you can't really rely
19:16 - on all the information it's giving you
19:18 - most of the time what it shared was
19:20 - correct but there was a lot of examples
19:22 - that were either misguided not in
19:24 - context difficult to follow along with
19:26 - or they relied on some previous know
19:28 - that I didn't have so with all of that
19:30 - said let me give you a suggestion on how
19:32 - to use chat gbt more effectively if you
19:34 - are learning something first of all
19:36 - don't rely on this as your primary
19:38 - source of information get some kind of
19:40 - video course obviously I have a bunch I
19:42 - have one with course careers you guys
19:43 - can check out or I have a bunch of free
19:45 - ones on my channel go to some kind of
19:47 - documentation just find a reputable
19:49 - resource where you know the person
19:50 - teaching it is actually good at teaching
19:52 - has experience with it and isn't going
19:54 - to skip over fundamental topics use that
19:57 - as your primary source of information
19:59 - where you learn the Core Concepts and
20:01 - you know that nothing critical is going
20:03 - to be skipped over now while you're
20:05 - going through that have chat gbd open
20:07 - maybe on another window and a different
20:08 - Monitor and use it as a personal tutor
20:11 - and something to really quickly give you
20:13 - feedback and answer questions that maybe
20:15 - aren't covered by some kind of
20:17 - asynchronous course for example right if
20:18 - you're watching a video of mine you
20:20 - might have a question I don't cover
20:21 - that's where chat GPT comes in where you
20:23 - can really have a focused discussion and
20:25 - a focused answer on one very fine
20:28 - grained thin you don't want to go to
20:30 - chat gbt and say hey teach me for Loops
20:33 - it might be able to do that but it's
20:34 - just really unreliable and you're going
20:36 - to be brought in all different kinds of
20:38 - directions whereas if you can go in
20:39 - there say hey here's my code it's not
20:41 - working can you help me with that that's
20:42 - a lot more of a detail answer and
20:44 - something chat GPT is quite better at
20:46 - doing so with that said guys I'm going
20:48 - to wrap it up here I hope you enjoyed
20:50 - the video if you did make sure to leave
20:51 - a like subscribe to the channel and I
20:53 - will see you in the next

Cleaned transcript:

it's no secret that chat GPT is pretty impressive but can it actually teach you to code entirely on its own well today I'm going to put that to the test using just chat GPT I'm going to attempt to learn the C programming language now even though I do have some experien programming I'm going to act like a complete beginner and I'm only going to do exactly what Chad GPT tells me to be honest with you I have no idea how this is going to go so stick around to find out now let's just be honest here if you want to attempt this on your own you're going to need to know a bit about how chat gbt actually works now fortunately HubSpot has a great free resource called using chat GPT at work which breaks down exactly how to use chat gbt as effectively as possible it's a bundle that gives you a comprehensive overview of how the tool works it also gives you some best practices and expert insights now I've left a link to it in the description and you can check it out completely for free this guide contains a decision flowchart templates for set and clear guidelines an AI generated content refinement guide and even an AI adoption checklist it really breaks down how to best utilize this tool and make the most of its capabilities to increase your efficiency and your processes and if that wasn't enough there's over a 100 prompts that you can start using immediately personally my favorite part of this resource is the guide that shows you how to supercharge your workday with chat gbt which is a game Cher for daily productivity this resource and tons of others are provided for free by HubSpot a massive thank you to them for making all of this available and for sponsoring today's video so first things first we're going to need some kind of plan or road mapap I don't really know anything about C or how you're supposed to learn it so let's see if chat GPT can help us with that okay so I just asked it hey I'm looking to learn the C programming language act as though I'm a complete beginner and give me a road map or guide on how I can learn this language so this is pretty straightforward but let's see what it gives us for this and I want kind of my goal for this video to be to create an entire project using C and again I'm just going to do whatever chat GPT tells me I'm going to act as though I'm a beginner and I'm just going to follow along with all of its instructions and see if with good prompting it will actually get me in the right direction and we can kind of achieve that goal so it's giv me a bit of a road map here but as I'm reading through this it's extremely vague for example you know what is programming basic computer architecture how computers understand and run programs mean I don't know if we really need to learn that to understand C I install a c compiler okay that's good it's giving me a few options here but it doesn't say how I'm able to write compile use the compiler what a compiler is learn the syntax and basic concepts okay I guess that's good dive into more complex topics overall it's super super vague and it's not really giving me any actionable things to actually do so I'm going to try again and ask it to adjust it to kind of like a checklist of topics so I have something a little a little bit better to follow along with because right now if I was a complete beginner and I just had this I would already be pretty lost all right so I just asked it to revise this and give me a list of topics in some logical order so that I can kind of follow along with those step by step I think that's a little bit easier and then we can just tackle each step at a time so let's get it to finish this list here and then we can start learning these in this order all right so that is a much better list here and what I've done is I've just taken it and put it here in a Google doc just so it's a bit easier for me to follow along and keep track of my progress so what I'm going to do is just go through this step by step let's begin by seeing if chat GPT can show me how to accurately set up a compiler and how to use that and kind of get started on my computer okay so next step we're going to get set up with our C program programming environment so I just asked it to walk me through that and assume that I'm a complete beginner now it tells me there's different steps Windows Mac Etc on Mac it says open the terminal type this follow the onscreen instructions so let's copy this command here now we'll assume that we already know how to open the terminal but if you're a complete beginner you may not even know how to do that or what the terminal is however I'll bring the terminal open on the right side of my screen let's paste that in and move this to the left and let's see what we get it says xcode select error command line tools are already installed okay so I'm going to copy this and ask chat jbt what to do about that because if I was a beginner I may not actually know and also I'm assuming that for this command to work you need xcode to be installed which I already have installed if you didn't have it installed I think this probably wouldn't work and already you would be stuck so I'll just say hey I'm getting this error in the terminal can you help me okay so let's see what it says about this so it pretty much told me here that this is good news because it means I already have them installed so I'm going to skip the rest of the steps here but the fact that is giving me all these new commands again that could be confusing for a beginner who might just want to copy and paste everything that's inside of here anyways I know that these are already working so that's fine so let's move on to step two which says choose and set up a text editor or IDE so it says vs code go to visual studio code website and download the installer okay I've already done that run the installer and then install the extension so let's open up vs code and install that extension so vs code is open here obviously I know how to use this but as a complete beginner I would assume that you would have no idea what this tool is how you use it or even what an extension is or how to install that so let's ask chat gbt how to install the extension how do I install the C C+ extension in vs code remember I've never used this before let's see what it gives us with that all right so fortunately it's giv me some pretty good instructions here and it tells me how to access the extension View and then to search for this extension so let's go ahead and do that c/ C++ okay by Microsoft let's go ahead and install that so the extension is installed let's go on to the next step here which is to write compile and run a simple program so we're going to create a new file let's assume that we can figure that out so let's go here and make a new file we're going to save this as hello.c okay I'll just replace I was doing this for let's copy this code and paste it inside of here so now it says to compile our program we're going to need to open up the terminal and we're going to type the following command so Mac OS okay let's copy that now I'm going to go through this as if I know how this works but I know for many beginners first of all they're not going to understand you actually need to save this file which I just did they're not going to know how to open or create a new file and they're not going to know how to open up the terminal or the command prompt with inv vs code or navigate to the correct directory so it's skipping over a ton of different steps for the purpose of this video and not to drag it on I'll just go with how I know how to actually do it but for 90% of people that are just starting out there's no way they're going to be able to follow this uh without some more detailed instruction or knowing to ask the right questions so anyways let's type this here and see if that actually works okay so it looks like it did however I didn't get any output so what does it say here run your program after the compilation type do /hello okay and are we going to get some output here we did we got hello world okay so Step One is complete we've been able to write our first program so let's check that one off the list here let me just make this green let's move on to step number two all right so as we move on to step two here I'm realizing there's going to be a lot of prompts and a lot of output so in the nature of not boring you I'm going to fast forward through quite a bit of this go through these steps on my own and we'll see how far I can get without any significant issues so I've got to a point here where I'm asking it about operators and already I'm noticing a huge issue that I think I'm going to keep running into as I go through this so I've just asked it to explain to me the basic operators which was this step in my road map and as I've done that here it started throwing me a bunch of code that I've never seen before and it's not really building upon what we had before for example now we're doing a comma so like multiple variables in the same line it doesn't explain that I'm not sure what that is we're doing a declaration without actually assigning a value and now we're even using IF statements and we're evaluating the results of different conditions and it hasn't talked about that at all so yeah it's intuitive I guess what's going on but as a complete beginner I have so many questions I guess I could ask chat GPT that but ideally it shouldn't be showing me a bunch of code that I've never seen before already so early in my journey so we've moved over here to scan F and getting user input however I keep running into the same issue with Chachi where it's throwing a lot of stuff at me that it hasn't explained at all for example we're looking at character arrays which I guess in CR strings I don't even know because it hasn't explained that we're looking at using this Ampersand which is getting the pointer or the address of this variable now I've asked it some questions about that but the same issue keeps popping up where it keeps throwing really complex explanations using a ton of terms that I just know many beginners wouldn't understand obviously I can understand most of this because I know how to code already but even some of the things it's mentioning to me an experienced programmer are quite confusing and really overwhelming so I'm going to change my prompt style a little bit and see if I can get it to give me kind of little Snippets of information so I can work through it a bit slower and not get overwhelmed with so much code all right so I've adjusted my prompting style a bit and I've told it to really focus on giving me bits of information and then asking me if I understand it before we proceed now it's kind of done that it's definitely doing a better job now and let me show you kind of the output that I'm getting so it gives me a small bit of information quick example a little bit of an explanation and then it tells me okay try this so some kind of exercise which is definitely better than what we had before and then it also asks me if it's good and if we can move forward to the next step now I don't like the fact that it just automatically gives the next next piece of information I'm sure I can tell it not to do that but at least it's giving me little logical sections that I can read and Approach at once this is significantly better than what I had before what I'm realizing already is that you have to be really really detailed with the way you ask chat GPT and even within a lot of these explanations for example we get into things like a switch statement it talks about a fall through so where's that yeah from falling through the next case but it doesn't explain what that is so in anytime you see information that hasn't yet been explained you have to ask it to elaborate which is what I did with the switch statement so explain fall through and then it will give you a really good explanation but you can't really rely on it to explain all little details you would need to understand to get good at program so just to give you quick update on my progress here I've made it all the way up to recursion so I've just learned of a functions now I'm doing recursion honestly I don't love the order in which it's giving me all these things this is not how I would teach this if I was going to teach to complete beginners but we're using chat GPT and we're following along with what it says so we've just written a Fibonacci function we just looked at what was the other one it showed us um calculating a factorial it's getting us into even some algorithm type stuff already before we even understand things like arrays or other compon components within programming but we're following along with it so let's see how far we get so another small note for you guys I'm looking at preprocessor directives which to me seems like a pretty complicated thing quite early in my learning uh anyways as I've gone through here it's shown me a few examples for example like using the this if L if else so I just assumed okay I can just you know throw this outside of my program right like I can just put it up here and say if debug print something out but that started giving me an error so trap gbt was able to fix that error for me it told me why I was getting that issue what I'm really noticing is that it's not being very specific and it's not explaining any prerequisites where I need to put the code it's just kind of assuming that I'm going to figure it out so in this area where this is something that I've actually never seen before I've never used it already I was a little bit confused on where I use this why I use it how I would actually end up using it yeah I can figure it out but it's taking me a little bit longer just because it's kind of misguiding me are giving me some information that's not really in the correct context so it's been a few hours now I've been messing with C I've been learning with chat jbt I did some exercises I did a few mini projects and I feel somewhat comfortable with the link which I've learned some of the new features like the preprocessor directives structures dynamic memory address allocation macros all those kinds of things however the order in which I was taught it was definitely very strange and I had a lot of uh kind of bumps and issues while I was trying to learn these topics so at this point what I want to do is share with you what worked well here what didn't work at all and what my tips and general advices for using chat GPT to learn a language or to learn really any programming concept so first of all let's just get this out of the way the only reason I was somewhat successful here and could learn even some of these new C features is because I already know how to program I'm a very experienced developer I've worked in many different programming languages I've seen a lot of these features before or at least similar features with different maybe syntax and that's why I was able to pretty quickly learn a lot of these new topics however I can tell you as someone who teaches a lot of beginner programmers this skips so many prerequisites assumes so much knowledge and really very quickly jumps you into a lot of advanced topics without obviously knowing if you understand them or even breaking down the fundamental concepts that allow you to understand those so yes for me this was okay for someone who's an experienced developer sure you can learn in this format but if you're a complete beginner and you're using something like chat GPT there's no chance that you're going to be able to pick up everything you need to actually move on to those more advanced topics and not get overwhelmed and confused now with all that in mind let me share with you what I think this is actually really good at so the First Advantage that I found is that this is extremely fast I don't think I've ever learned stuff as quickly as using something like chat GPT and that's simply because I'm already experienced enough that I don't need like a long drawn out explanation I don't need to watch a whole video or a long tutorial series I can just instantly ask a question and get the answer very very fast so that's the first thing that I appreciated it's just super quick it spits out anything that I want immediately and it's a single source that I'm using I don't need to go and look at all these different resources online I don't need to find a really good course or curriculum I don't need to scan through documentation and with that in mind even if it doesn't give me what I'm looking for right away I know how to adjust the prompt in the question to get what I want so I can ask it to give me a different example to give me a code snippet to copy in to walk through the code line by line if I have a question or a doubt there's an area that I don't understand I can immediately have that solved and have a new explanation or a new example whereas if I was using something like a course or document ation whatever is there is all that I have access to yes I can go search for something else but that's going to take me quite a bit longer and jumping between 10 15 20 different resources just isn't efficient and it's going to kind of lead you along like a path where you're just going back and forth zigzagging and finding all different kinds of information from all different kinds of people so that's what I really appreciated here just the speed at which I can get information all I have to do is just come up with a decent question and then I can really focus in on one area and get any doubter question question I have answered immediately now with that in mind let's talk about all of the negatives so if you are someone who doesn't really know where to start you don't already have a curriculum or a road map and you go to chat GPT you're going to be brought in so many different directions and it's not really going to guide you very well on what you should learn and in what order we saw already here that I asked it for two different versions of a road map for learning C they had some good topics but the order was really weird it's a non order that I personally would ever recommend for learning a l anguage it was showing me some Advanced features after I just learned about if statements or functions for example we're getting into recursion before we even talk about arrays or strings or we've even ridden a sampled program it's showing me memory addressed pointers and all these Advanced features and assuming that I know them when I've never even written code before at least that's what I was trying to simulate so it was just a really backwards order and kind of a weird way of going through things and you can't rely on that being a good curriculum I think for me that was the biggest realization is that yes it's giving me something that seems good in the moment but if I was someone who's never done this before I wouldn't really want to rely on this and I wouldn't know if it was actually guiding me in the correct direction so it's one of those things where it kind of speaks with complete confidence says yeah this is what you need to do so it seems like the right thing but when you know better you realize that you can't rely on a lot of the information that's being provided to you so with that in mind what you would really need to do is go find some curriculum that's solid that's vetted that a lot of people have followed through with or from a reputable source take that and then use that to kind of guide your journey in chat gbt where you could focus in on more specific topics now even Within These topics though what I realized is that chat GPT is very bad when it comes to assuming knowledge even when I explicitly told it to treat me like a complete beginner that had no prior experience it still assumed that I had software installed that I knew how to navigate my computer that I knew what different programs were I know how to save files open files how to get to the terminal there's just all these different things that you might not think about now as an experienced developer when you're starting out there are huge roadblocks and they're really frustrating so overall the biggest issues I found is that it can be really vague if you don't direct it exactly on what you want it really assumes quite a bit of knowledge that you may or may not actually know and you can't really rely on all the information it's giving you most of the time what it shared was correct but there was a lot of examples that were either misguided not in context difficult to follow along with or they relied on some previous know that I didn't have so with all of that said let me give you a suggestion on how to use chat gbt more effectively if you are learning something first of all don't rely on this as your primary source of information get some kind of video course obviously I have a bunch I have one with course careers you guys can check out or I have a bunch of free ones on my channel go to some kind of documentation just find a reputable resource where you know the person teaching it is actually good at teaching has experience with it and isn't going to skip over fundamental topics use that as your primary source of information where you learn the Core Concepts and you know that nothing critical is going to be skipped over now while you're going through that have chat gbd open maybe on another window and a different Monitor and use it as a personal tutor and something to really quickly give you feedback and answer questions that maybe aren't covered by some kind of asynchronous course for example right if you're watching a video of mine you might have a question I don't cover that's where chat GPT comes in where you can really have a focused discussion and a focused answer on one very fine grained thin you don't want to go to chat gbt and say hey teach me for Loops it might be able to do that but it's just really unreliable and you're going to be brought in all different kinds of directions whereas if you can go in there say hey here's my code it's not working can you help me with that that's a lot more of a detail answer and something chat GPT is quite better at doing so with that said guys I'm going to wrap it up here I hope you enjoyed the video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one oh
