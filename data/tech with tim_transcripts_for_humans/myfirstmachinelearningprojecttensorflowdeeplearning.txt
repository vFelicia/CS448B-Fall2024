00:00 - hey guys and welcome back in this video
00:02 - I'm going to be talking to you about
00:04 - machine learning and how I made my first
00:06 - machine learning application
00:08 - so pretty much I am working in Python
00:10 - here I'm using tensorflow the GPU
00:12 - version on my computer and I managed to
00:15 - create a number guessing program or
00:19 - model whatever you want to call it so
00:21 - pretty much given handwritten digits
00:23 - it's able to guess what number that
00:26 - actually is with a fair degree of
00:28 - accuracy so rather than me just talking
00:31 - about it why don't I show you first of
00:32 - all so I have these four files up here
00:35 - create model draw number test network
00:37 - neural network so the way this works is
00:39 - using a very basic neural network I'm
00:41 - just gonna run this test network script
00:42 - because well I've already created the
00:44 - model so we just want to run it and see
00:47 - if it works okay so we're using
00:48 - tensorflow it just takes a second to
00:50 - boot up and then once it does I've
00:52 - actually made this like a visual
00:53 - representation for you guys so you can
00:54 - see exactly what it looks like okay so
00:57 - just using matplotlib if you know what
00:59 - that is in python i've just drawn out
01:01 - all of the input data that you load in
01:03 - from tensorflow because it has like a
01:04 - default a bunch of these images that you
01:07 - feed in to train the model so I've
01:10 - loaded in a seven okay and then you can
01:12 - see down here says I predict this
01:13 - numbers a seven the number actually is a
01:15 - seven okay and I didn't just put like
01:18 - what the number is printed twice this
01:20 - actually works and I'm going to show you
01:21 - another example in just a second so if I
01:23 - close this you can see it loads up a two
01:25 - we get to this number actually is a two
01:27 - and we can just keep going through and
01:29 - it'll keep guessing what the number is
01:31 - and maybe if we get lucky it'll get one
01:33 - wrong but this does have like a 98%
01:36 - accuracy or something like that so
01:37 - chances are probably not and these here
01:39 - are meant to simulate handwritten digits
01:42 - just obviously like with pixels okay
01:44 - nine and I think I do this what like ten
01:47 - times we'll just go through and show you
01:49 - okay so there you go this program got
01:50 - zero wrong out of ten that the length of
01:53 - the entire test data set we only went
01:55 - through ten of them okay that's pretty
01:57 - cool and that looks like wow that's
01:59 - working really well but how does that
02:01 - work well I'm gonna show you now this
02:03 - working with me actually drawing numbers
02:05 - and this is something that I created
02:07 - myself and I'll show you because the
02:09 - other ones I kind of follow the tutorial
02:10 - to do so main
02:12 - draw numbers that's what we need to run
02:13 - okay so I'm just using PI game here and
02:16 - I have like a basic grid and pretty much
02:18 - if I decide to draw a number on the grid
02:20 - like that so it's seven and I press the
02:22 - spacebar then tensorflow loads up my
02:24 - model and it's predicts what the number
02:27 - is so it says I predict this number is a
02:29 - seven and you guys see I didn't
02:30 - hard-code anything in there saying like
02:32 - this is gonna be a seven I just true a
02:33 - seven to the screen now this does not
02:36 - work very well and I'll show you like if
02:38 - I draw three chances are it's not gonna
02:41 - be able to guess that this is a three oh
02:42 - god it's a three but sometimes like if
02:46 - you do complex numbers like sixes or
02:47 - eights especially when I'm drawing with
02:49 - a mouse and not with like a pencil it's
02:52 - really difficult for the computer yes
02:53 - even if I do like a one like this let's
02:55 - see okay it's not proving me you're all
02:59 - right here okay let's do a six so it's a
03:01 - crude six but if we take a guess it says
03:05 - oh I predict this number is a six so
03:07 - that actually worked but sometimes this
03:09 - tends to crash and I think I can
03:10 - probably get it to crash you guys okay
03:12 - so let's try an eight click the spacebar
03:16 - I predict those numbers of three okay so
03:17 - you guys can see that this has some
03:19 - resemblance to a 3 so it predicts that
03:22 - it's a three and this is just cuz I
03:23 - don't draw it exactly like the test data
03:26 - that I've sent in and this is kind of
03:28 - showing you the flaw in some of these
03:29 - neural networks and why I need to
03:30 - improve them if I draw like a zero again
03:33 - a crude zero all right see I predict
03:35 - this numbers of two so it makes quite a
03:37 - few mistakes because the data that I'm
03:40 - drawing in here doesn't look like the
03:43 - data that it was shown in most cases
03:45 - okay so that's how that works so pretty
03:49 - much the way that I coded this is using
03:51 - like a standard neural network I set up
03:53 - one like the hard way by typing out all
03:55 - the layers myself and then I did one in
03:57 - create model here just using the new
04:01 - version of the care ass at it caris I
04:03 - don't know you say adding layers and
04:05 - this is literally the entire model like
04:07 - this okay this is creating the model
04:10 - this is getting the test out of here
04:12 - this is training the model and then this
04:14 - would be all this code down here would
04:16 - be testing models you guys can see that
04:17 - this whole machine learning thing that's
04:20 - based off of is only done in 30 lines
04:22 - the longest part is actually grabbing
04:25 - the information
04:25 - I draw in on a grid and that's what this
04:28 - whole file is here draw number dot pi
04:30 - because it has to get actually all the
04:33 - pixels on the grid and put it into a
04:35 - form that our neural network can look at
04:37 - and read so anyways the way that the
04:40 - reason I showed you guys this is cuz I
04:41 - kind of want to get you excited about
04:42 - machine learning and what's coming to
04:44 - the channel I'm planning on making
04:45 - tutorials about how to do some of the
04:47 - stuff like this maybe doing a tutorial
04:48 - on how I made this kind of first machine
04:50 - learning stuff once I tweaked it a bit
04:52 - and as soon as I learn more about
04:55 - machine learning and get more
04:56 - comfortable with it you can expect to
04:57 - see a lot of those tutorials on the
04:59 - channel where I'm going to apply them to
05:00 - different projects and make them really
05:02 - useful not just spitting out little text
05:04 - things that you can look at and be like
05:06 - oh that's cool it says it's working
05:07 - right where you can't actually look at
05:09 - the data which is what we want to do so
05:11 - yeah so if you guys want to see these
05:12 - tutorials and see this machine learning
05:14 - stuff make sure you guys let me know in
05:15 - the comments and by hitting that like
05:18 - button because that keeps me motivated
05:19 - and makes me want to produce content
05:22 - faster and I'm really excited with this
05:24 - machine learning stuff and I hope you
05:25 - guys are as well so with that being said
05:27 - I think I'm gonna wrap up the video here
05:29 - I hope you guys enjoyed if you did
05:30 - please make sure you leave a like and
05:32 - subscribe and I'll see you again in
05:33 - another video
