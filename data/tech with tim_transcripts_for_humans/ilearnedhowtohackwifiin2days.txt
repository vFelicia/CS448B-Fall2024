With timestamps:

00:00 - in just two days I learned how to hack
00:02 - Wi-Fi networks steal passwords grab
00:05 - banking credentials and essentially
00:06 - intercept all web traffic all it took
00:09 - was a laptop a virtual machine running
00:11 - Kali Linux a few hours a time and quite
00:14 - a bit of reading in this video I'm going
00:15 - to share with you how I did that the
00:17 - common ways that hackers steal your
00:19 - information and how you can protect
00:21 - yourself from these types of attacks
00:22 - disclaimer this is extremely illegal do
00:26 - not do this and if you are going to do
00:27 - it actually do it at home don't do it
00:29 - outside of your local network so let's
00:31 - get started with a bit of background on
00:33 - how Wi-Fi networks work when you connect
00:35 - to Wi-Fi your device and router start a
00:38 - high-tech conversation your device sends
00:40 - a request to join the network and the
00:41 - router assigns it a unique IP address to
00:44 - visit a website your device sends a
00:46 - request in the form of encoded data
00:48 - packets to the router these packets are
00:50 - passed to the modem converted for
00:52 - transmission over your broadband and
00:54 - sent across the internet to the website
00:56 - server these servers respond by sending
00:59 - the website data back along the same
01:00 - path through the modem router and
01:03 - finally back to your device now to keep
01:05 - all of this data secure your device uses
01:07 - something known as encryption this
01:09 - process involves a pair of keys one
01:11 - public key one private key your device
01:13 - uses the recipient's public key to
01:15 - scramble the information into a code
01:17 - this turns your readable data into a
01:20 - jumbled mess meaning that if a hacker
01:21 - intercepts your data all they're going
01:23 - to see is a bunch of gibberish that they
01:24 - can't understand on the other end the
01:27 - recipient has the private key they use
01:29 - this private key to decrypt or
01:30 - unscramble the code and read the
01:32 - information this two key system is
01:34 - what's known as public key
01:35 - infrastructure or pki and it's at the
01:38 - heart of secure protocols like https and
01:41 - wpa3 what's more the private key is
01:44 - never shared or transmitted over the
01:46 - Internet making it extremely difficult
01:47 - for The Intruders to break the code so
01:50 - as your data travels from device to
01:51 - server it's like it's inside of a secure
01:54 - locked box that only the recipient has
01:56 - the key to open now with all that said
01:58 - hackers can still see steal and access
02:00 - your data even if it's encrypted and I'm
02:03 - going to walk you through the two common
02:04 - ways that they do that right now keep in
02:06 - mind this is for educational purposes
02:08 - only and there are plenty of ways to
02:10 - protect yourself like by using a VPN or
02:12 - by using this device right here which is
02:14 - called the deeper Connect Air from
02:16 - deeper connect who sponsored this video
02:18 - now this little device right here
02:20 - actually goes a Step Beyond a VPN and
02:23 - provides a DPN or a decentralized
02:25 - private Network this connects you to a
02:27 - distributed decentralized set of nodes
02:29 - which give you an extra level of
02:31 - security and provide a ton of other
02:32 - features that we'll dive into later in
02:34 - this video so now let's talk about
02:36 - sniffing which is the first method
02:38 - hackers use to access your information a
02:40 - packet sniffer is a software or Hardware
02:42 - tool that can intercept and log traffic
02:44 - passing over a network with every
02:46 - website you visit every picture you
02:48 - upload every word you send the packet
02:50 - sniffer is watching collecting and
02:52 - deciphering this data it can do this by
02:54 - intercepting radio waves sent between
02:56 - your device and the routing even when
02:59 - you think your data is safe masked by
03:01 - encryption it might not be entirely Out
03:03 - Of Reach a seasoned hacker can pick up
03:05 - bits of unencrypted data called metadata
03:07 - this metadata might reveal what websites
03:09 - you're visiting how often you go there
03:11 - and how much data you're passing back
03:13 - and forth in skilled hands a packet
03:15 - sniffer can even exploit vulnerabilities
03:17 - in network security to decrypt data or
03:20 - inject malicious packets turning your
03:22 - own digital devices against you now
03:24 - Wi-Fi sniffing tools are easily
03:26 - available and they can turn public
03:27 - networks into a risky environment
03:29 - fortunately strong encryption protocols
03:31 - can mitigate your risk but even so it's
03:33 - not recommended to transmit any
03:35 - sensitive data like banking information
03:36 - or passwords when you're using a public
03:39 - network and you're unprotected now
03:41 - diving into a bit more of an advanced
03:43 - method this is the man in the middle
03:44 - attack so packet sniffing is really more
03:46 - of a beginner type attack anyone can do
03:48 - this you guys can probably figure it out
03:50 - in just a few hours the man in the
03:52 - middle is a bit more complicated but
03:53 - potentially a lot more harmful during a
03:55 - man in the middle attack the hacker
03:57 - manipulates the communication process
03:59 - they explain vulnerabilities in the
04:01 - Wi-Fi security protocols and they trick
04:03 - your device into thinking that they're
04:05 - the router this way they control the
04:07 - data flow capturing everything you
04:09 - transmit emails passwords credit cards
04:11 - whatever it is now don't think that
04:13 - encrypted data is safe here either
04:15 - through sophisticated techniques like
04:17 - SSL stripping the hacker can actually
04:19 - force your device to downgrade its
04:21 - secure https connection to something
04:23 - like an HTTP connection making the
04:25 - encrypted messages readable using the
04:27 - less secure protocol they can even
04:29 - leverage a rogue certificate fooling
04:32 - your device into believing they are a
04:33 - trusted entity this way your device
04:35 - willingly hands over data thinking it's
04:37 - securely encrypted when in fact it's
04:39 - accessible and readable for the hacker
04:41 - these attacks are much more complicated
04:43 - to pull off with a lot more knowledge
04:45 - required but can result in a ton of
04:47 - danger again if you're using some kind
04:49 - of network unprotected
04:53 - now after learning all this myself and
04:55 - being someone who's pretty technical I
04:57 - decided I'd give this a shot and see if
04:59 - I could actually perform some type of
05:01 - very simple hacking attack on my local
05:03 - network now to my surprise by day two I
05:06 - was actually able to successfully do
05:07 - this and intercept all of the HTTP and
05:10 - https traffic from one of my local
05:12 - laptops now I'm going to share with you
05:14 - in the name of Education some of the
05:16 - basic steps that I used here to actually
05:18 - perform this hacking attack but I want
05:20 - to make it very clear that this is
05:21 - extremely illegal I'm not giving you
05:23 - enough information here to replicate
05:25 - this I'm just giving you enough that you
05:27 - have some sense of what goes on behind
05:29 - the scenes and how simple it can
05:31 - actually be for someone to go set up at
05:33 - a coffee shop and start stealing your
05:35 - information again if you're unprotected
05:37 - on some type of public Wi-Fi network so
05:39 - how did I do this well the first thing I
05:41 - did is I installed a virtual machine on
05:43 - my computer and I ran an instance of
05:45 - Kali Linux now if you're not familiar
05:47 - with Cali this is a very popular
05:49 - operating system that has a ton of
05:50 - network utilities built in and is known
05:53 - for doing some type of hacking attacks
05:55 - and just kind of being a hacker OS I
05:57 - know it's a weird thing but Cali Linux
05:59 - has that reputation now from there I
06:01 - just searched a bunch of stuff on Google
06:03 - read a bunch of Articles surprisingly it
06:05 - wasn't that difficult to actually find
06:07 - how to perform this and the first thing
06:09 - I did is I configured my computer to act
06:11 - as a router Network what this means is
06:13 - that I would be able to reroute data
06:15 - from my computer to the router and
06:18 - essentially Was preparing myself to kind
06:19 - of sit in the middle of a machine and
06:22 - the router and perform a man in the
06:23 - middle attack from there I did a network
06:25 - scan where I identified the local IP
06:28 - address of the target device in this
06:29 - case was my laptop and you'd be
06:31 - surprised at the tools that they have
06:32 - here actually allow you to view the
06:34 - device type make model and a bunch of
06:36 - other information so it was very easy
06:38 - for me to actually find the local IP
06:40 - address of the machine that I wanted to
06:42 - Target from there what I did is
06:44 - something called ARP spoofing or ARP
06:46 - spoofing now without getting into too
06:48 - much detail this essentially tells the
06:50 - target device that my IP address is the
06:52 - IP address of the router meaning it's
06:54 - going to send all of its traffic to me
06:56 - first where I then forward it to the
06:58 - router and send information back that
07:00 - way it doesn't know that it's being
07:01 - targeted but I'm able to intercept all
07:04 - of the different traffic at this point
07:05 - I'm able to view all of the payload data
07:07 - for HTTP and https traffic anything
07:10 - that's insecure I can just read it's
07:12 - unencrypted I can read all of that data
07:14 - however encrypted data like https
07:17 - traffic is still encrypted and I can't
07:19 - read it so to be able to do that I
07:21 - actually needed to perform an SSL strip
07:23 - this means that I'm pretty much tricking
07:25 - the target machine into using HTTP
07:28 - rather than https so I'm able to
07:31 - actually view the unencrypted data now
07:33 - eventually after a ton of trial and
07:34 - error and messing with a bunch of
07:36 - different commands I was actually able
07:37 - to successfully do this and to read the
07:40 - different password data when I was
07:42 - signing into what seemed like a secure
07:44 - form from my local laptop not going to
07:46 - give you any more information than that
07:47 - what I want to do now is tell you how
07:49 - you can defend yourself from these types
07:51 - of attacks now the good news here is
07:52 - that it's relatively simple to protect
07:54 - yourself from these types of attacks or
07:56 - to make it much more difficult for
07:57 - hackers to gain your information now the
08:00 - simplest way to do this is to use a VPN
08:02 - now a virtual private Network
08:03 - establishes a secure encrypted tunnel
08:06 - between your device and a remote server
08:08 - allowing data to be transmitted more
08:10 - securely now this isn't going to stop
08:12 - every single type of attack but it's
08:14 - going to make it a lot more difficult
08:15 - for someone to read your data if they
08:17 - are actually able to intercept it now
08:19 - beyond that what a VPN will do is
08:21 - provide security and privacy by actually
08:23 - concealing your location and allowing
08:25 - you to connect first to some type of VPN
08:28 - server and then to the website that
08:30 - you're trying to access it gets a lot
08:31 - more complicated than that but typically
08:33 - by using a VPN you can conceal your
08:35 - location and have a lot more privacy
08:37 - online now regular vpns work just fine
08:40 - but I want to introduce you to this
08:41 - really interesting Hardware device here
08:43 - called the deeper Connect Air now up
08:45 - until doing this sponsorship I have
08:47 - never heard of this device if it will
08:48 - focus in my camera here but this
08:50 - actually connects with USBC to your
08:52 - computer allow laptop whatever it may be
08:54 - it also has a USB dongle and this is a
08:57 - physical device that provides a
08:58 - decentralized private Network now
09:00 - there's no subscription once you buy it
09:02 - you have access to it for life you can
09:04 - put it in any type of device and you can
09:06 - even transmit a network that other
09:07 - devices can connect to now since this is
09:10 - a hardware device that means you
09:11 - actually get a bunch of customizations
09:13 - and additional features that you don't
09:15 - get from standard VPN networks so for
09:17 - example you automatically get YouTube ad
09:19 - block you get geolocation spoofing you
09:22 - get the ability to actually unblock
09:24 - pretty much any type of content and have
09:26 - that automatically done for you so you
09:28 - don't have to manually change your
09:30 - server every time you go to a different
09:31 - site streaming website whatever it may
09:33 - be now full disclosure here they have
09:35 - sponsored the video but this is actually
09:37 - a really unique product and when I
09:39 - plugged it in it worked instantly it was
09:41 - pretty well Plug and Play there's like
09:42 - two or three little setup steps that
09:44 - took pretty much 30 seconds to get
09:45 - through and now we can just use this on
09:47 - any device that I want I can bring it
09:49 - with me anywhere and I never need to pay
09:51 - for a subscription again now Beyond just
09:53 - the economics of this since it is a
09:55 - decentralized network this means you do
09:57 - actually get enhanced security benefits
09:59 - now I'm not sure how important this is
10:01 - to all of you but I'll just quickly
10:02 - describe what's meant by a decentralized
10:04 - private Network so think of this similar
10:06 - to a blockchain network where you have a
10:09 - bunch of different nodes that are
10:10 - running around the world that are owned
10:11 - independently I mean they could be owned
10:13 - by a company but not one company
10:15 - controls all of the individual nodes and
10:17 - when you connect to this decentralized
10:19 - private Network you're connecting to a
10:21 - bunch of different nodes that are
10:22 - running around the world now the more
10:24 - people that connect to this the more
10:26 - nodes that exist and the faster the
10:28 - network gets so as it gets bigger and
10:30 - bigger it actually gets more performant
10:31 - and more efficient to run now this is in
10:34 - contrast to a regular VPN where let's
10:36 - say you use some popular VPN company
10:38 - right what's going to happen is you're
10:39 - connecting to their servers which are
10:41 - owned by them controlled by them and
10:43 - that means theoretically behind the
10:45 - scenes if they want to they can apply
10:47 - censorship they can view your different
10:48 - data they have access to all of it on
10:51 - the servers that you're connecting to so
10:53 - you're really trusting this third party
10:55 - or this company to keep all of your data
10:57 - safe and we've seen in the past that
10:58 - whenever we trust one large corporation
11:01 - there can be some some problems that
11:02 - occur with that I won't get into that
11:04 - too far in this video so anyways this is
11:05 - fully decentralized I like all the
11:07 - decentralized stuff I am a believer in
11:09 - that going forward hence what I'm
11:11 - sharing with you here now just you can
11:13 - see how this thing works I'm going to
11:14 - plug it into my computer right now and
11:15 - I'll show you how simple the setup is
11:24 - all right so I'm on my computer now I've
11:27 - got the device plugged in and I'll just
11:28 - quickly walk you through a bit of the
11:30 - setup and show you kind of the panel and
11:32 - all the configuration options you get so
11:34 - you can actually connect this in two
11:35 - ways the first way is the Wi-Fi dongle
11:37 - mode which is what I'm using right now
11:38 - where you just plug it into the computer
11:40 - and the second way is Wireless relay
11:42 - mode where this creates a network that
11:44 - you can connect to from your phone from
11:47 - any other device or maybe you can't
11:48 - actually plug this thing in okay so
11:51 - those are the two modes we're running in
11:53 - Wi-Fi dongle mode and all you do is plug
11:55 - the thing in wait for the light to
11:58 - change the right color and then you go
12:00 - to this IP address here you sign in and
12:02 - then you just scan for your network
12:03 - connect your network it connects from
12:06 - that physical Hardware device think of
12:07 - it as another like network interface
12:09 - card and then you can simply start using
12:12 - it right so I'll show you if I go to
12:14 - this IP address here I'm connected to it
12:16 - notice in the bottom right hand up
12:18 - corner of my screen it says internet
12:19 - access network 11. but I don't have
12:22 - Wi-Fi on and I don't have any ethernet
12:24 - cable plugged in so it is running off
12:26 - this device
12:27 - and if we come here you can view
12:29 - information about the memory CPU usage
12:31 - all of the ads that it's blocking so it
12:33 - blocks ads on websites like YouTube
12:35 - which is super useful and then if you go
12:37 - to something like the ad or starting to
12:39 - add app relocator you can actually
12:41 - change your server for a bunch of
12:42 - different apps meaning when I connect to
12:44 - Netflix it can automatically connect me
12:46 - to a US server when I connect to Disney
12:48 - plus maybe it connects me to an Asian
12:49 - server I can change so that way it
12:51 - automatically happens for me every time
12:54 - I go to those sites I don't have to
12:55 - manually change the network which is
12:57 - really nice or the server sorry so
12:59 - actually to show you a quick use case of
13:01 - this I've just unplugged the device and
13:03 - you can see the now I'm on peacock TV
13:05 - and I'm unable to access this site if I
13:07 - click on get started or sign in you see
13:09 - it just keeps bringing me to this page
13:10 - because I'm located in Canada and in
13:13 - Canada you can't access this streaming
13:15 - service so now what I'll do is plug the
13:17 - device back in change my location and
13:19 - show you that this will now work for me
13:21 - alright so I've plugged the device back
13:23 - in now and what I'm going to do is go
13:25 - over to the app relocator and notice
13:27 - here that now peacock is on United
13:28 - States rather than Canada so what I can
13:31 - do now is go back to Peacock TV so let's
13:34 - search for that here click on it and
13:36 - you'll see that now we can actually
13:37 - access this now I don't have a
13:39 - subscription but notice I'm not getting
13:40 - that unavailable page because now it's
13:42 - looking like I'm in the United States in
13:45 - terms of things like music we have
13:46 - access to these different apps flight
13:48 - and hotel subscription and why this is
13:50 - cool is because a lot of companies do
13:52 - price discrimination meaning I can
13:54 - actually connect out of somewhere like
13:55 - India and I can buy subscriptions at
13:58 - like one-fifth the cost that would
13:59 - normally cost to be in Canada so super
14:02 - cool a lot of other settings here I'm
14:04 - not going to go through all of it but we
14:05 - have things like an ad blocker you can
14:07 - get more complicated here with DNS
14:08 - filters https filters anyways you guys
14:11 - can mess around with this on your own if
14:12 - you do decide to get the product but
14:13 - just to prove this is working I can type
14:15 - something like yo it's gonna pop up it's
14:17 - functioning it's actually super fast uh
14:20 - and yeah that's pretty much all I had to
14:22 - show you so that said I think I'm gonna
14:23 - start wrapping it up here if you are
14:25 - interested in this product there will be
14:26 - a link in the description I know that
14:28 - this was a sponsored video but this is a
14:30 - really interesting product that I've
14:32 - been using ever since I got it super
14:34 - fast super impressed but and definitely
14:36 - something I'm going to continue to use I
14:38 - hope this video gave you guys a good
14:40 - amount of value if it did make sure to
14:41 - leave a like subscribe the channel I
14:43 - will see you in the next one
14:45 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

in just two days I learned how to hack WiFi networks steal passwords grab banking credentials and essentially intercept all web traffic all it took was a laptop a virtual machine running Kali Linux a few hours a time and quite a bit of reading in this video I'm going to share with you how I did that the common ways that hackers steal your information and how you can protect yourself from these types of attacks disclaimer this is extremely illegal do not do this and if you are going to do it actually do it at home don't do it outside of your local network so let's get started with a bit of background on how WiFi networks work when you connect to WiFi your device and router start a hightech conversation your device sends a request to join the network and the router assigns it a unique IP address to visit a website your device sends a request in the form of encoded data packets to the router these packets are passed to the modem converted for transmission over your broadband and sent across the internet to the website server these servers respond by sending the website data back along the same path through the modem router and finally back to your device now to keep all of this data secure your device uses something known as encryption this process involves a pair of keys one public key one private key your device uses the recipient's public key to scramble the information into a code this turns your readable data into a jumbled mess meaning that if a hacker intercepts your data all they're going to see is a bunch of gibberish that they can't understand on the other end the recipient has the private key they use this private key to decrypt or unscramble the code and read the information this two key system is what's known as public key infrastructure or pki and it's at the heart of secure protocols like https and wpa3 what's more the private key is never shared or transmitted over the Internet making it extremely difficult for The Intruders to break the code so as your data travels from device to server it's like it's inside of a secure locked box that only the recipient has the key to open now with all that said hackers can still see steal and access your data even if it's encrypted and I'm going to walk you through the two common ways that they do that right now keep in mind this is for educational purposes only and there are plenty of ways to protect yourself like by using a VPN or by using this device right here which is called the deeper Connect Air from deeper connect who sponsored this video now this little device right here actually goes a Step Beyond a VPN and provides a DPN or a decentralized private Network this connects you to a distributed decentralized set of nodes which give you an extra level of security and provide a ton of other features that we'll dive into later in this video so now let's talk about sniffing which is the first method hackers use to access your information a packet sniffer is a software or Hardware tool that can intercept and log traffic passing over a network with every website you visit every picture you upload every word you send the packet sniffer is watching collecting and deciphering this data it can do this by intercepting radio waves sent between your device and the routing even when you think your data is safe masked by encryption it might not be entirely Out Of Reach a seasoned hacker can pick up bits of unencrypted data called metadata this metadata might reveal what websites you're visiting how often you go there and how much data you're passing back and forth in skilled hands a packet sniffer can even exploit vulnerabilities in network security to decrypt data or inject malicious packets turning your own digital devices against you now WiFi sniffing tools are easily available and they can turn public networks into a risky environment fortunately strong encryption protocols can mitigate your risk but even so it's not recommended to transmit any sensitive data like banking information or passwords when you're using a public network and you're unprotected now diving into a bit more of an advanced method this is the man in the middle attack so packet sniffing is really more of a beginner type attack anyone can do this you guys can probably figure it out in just a few hours the man in the middle is a bit more complicated but potentially a lot more harmful during a man in the middle attack the hacker manipulates the communication process they explain vulnerabilities in the WiFi security protocols and they trick your device into thinking that they're the router this way they control the data flow capturing everything you transmit emails passwords credit cards whatever it is now don't think that encrypted data is safe here either through sophisticated techniques like SSL stripping the hacker can actually force your device to downgrade its secure https connection to something like an HTTP connection making the encrypted messages readable using the less secure protocol they can even leverage a rogue certificate fooling your device into believing they are a trusted entity this way your device willingly hands over data thinking it's securely encrypted when in fact it's accessible and readable for the hacker these attacks are much more complicated to pull off with a lot more knowledge required but can result in a ton of danger again if you're using some kind of network unprotected now after learning all this myself and being someone who's pretty technical I decided I'd give this a shot and see if I could actually perform some type of very simple hacking attack on my local network now to my surprise by day two I was actually able to successfully do this and intercept all of the HTTP and https traffic from one of my local laptops now I'm going to share with you in the name of Education some of the basic steps that I used here to actually perform this hacking attack but I want to make it very clear that this is extremely illegal I'm not giving you enough information here to replicate this I'm just giving you enough that you have some sense of what goes on behind the scenes and how simple it can actually be for someone to go set up at a coffee shop and start stealing your information again if you're unprotected on some type of public WiFi network so how did I do this well the first thing I did is I installed a virtual machine on my computer and I ran an instance of Kali Linux now if you're not familiar with Cali this is a very popular operating system that has a ton of network utilities built in and is known for doing some type of hacking attacks and just kind of being a hacker OS I know it's a weird thing but Cali Linux has that reputation now from there I just searched a bunch of stuff on Google read a bunch of Articles surprisingly it wasn't that difficult to actually find how to perform this and the first thing I did is I configured my computer to act as a router Network what this means is that I would be able to reroute data from my computer to the router and essentially Was preparing myself to kind of sit in the middle of a machine and the router and perform a man in the middle attack from there I did a network scan where I identified the local IP address of the target device in this case was my laptop and you'd be surprised at the tools that they have here actually allow you to view the device type make model and a bunch of other information so it was very easy for me to actually find the local IP address of the machine that I wanted to Target from there what I did is something called ARP spoofing or ARP spoofing now without getting into too much detail this essentially tells the target device that my IP address is the IP address of the router meaning it's going to send all of its traffic to me first where I then forward it to the router and send information back that way it doesn't know that it's being targeted but I'm able to intercept all of the different traffic at this point I'm able to view all of the payload data for HTTP and https traffic anything that's insecure I can just read it's unencrypted I can read all of that data however encrypted data like https traffic is still encrypted and I can't read it so to be able to do that I actually needed to perform an SSL strip this means that I'm pretty much tricking the target machine into using HTTP rather than https so I'm able to actually view the unencrypted data now eventually after a ton of trial and error and messing with a bunch of different commands I was actually able to successfully do this and to read the different password data when I was signing into what seemed like a secure form from my local laptop not going to give you any more information than that what I want to do now is tell you how you can defend yourself from these types of attacks now the good news here is that it's relatively simple to protect yourself from these types of attacks or to make it much more difficult for hackers to gain your information now the simplest way to do this is to use a VPN now a virtual private Network establishes a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server allowing data to be transmitted more securely now this isn't going to stop every single type of attack but it's going to make it a lot more difficult for someone to read your data if they are actually able to intercept it now beyond that what a VPN will do is provide security and privacy by actually concealing your location and allowing you to connect first to some type of VPN server and then to the website that you're trying to access it gets a lot more complicated than that but typically by using a VPN you can conceal your location and have a lot more privacy online now regular vpns work just fine but I want to introduce you to this really interesting Hardware device here called the deeper Connect Air now up until doing this sponsorship I have never heard of this device if it will focus in my camera here but this actually connects with USBC to your computer allow laptop whatever it may be it also has a USB dongle and this is a physical device that provides a decentralized private Network now there's no subscription once you buy it you have access to it for life you can put it in any type of device and you can even transmit a network that other devices can connect to now since this is a hardware device that means you actually get a bunch of customizations and additional features that you don't get from standard VPN networks so for example you automatically get YouTube ad block you get geolocation spoofing you get the ability to actually unblock pretty much any type of content and have that automatically done for you so you don't have to manually change your server every time you go to a different site streaming website whatever it may be now full disclosure here they have sponsored the video but this is actually a really unique product and when I plugged it in it worked instantly it was pretty well Plug and Play there's like two or three little setup steps that took pretty much 30 seconds to get through and now we can just use this on any device that I want I can bring it with me anywhere and I never need to pay for a subscription again now Beyond just the economics of this since it is a decentralized network this means you do actually get enhanced security benefits now I'm not sure how important this is to all of you but I'll just quickly describe what's meant by a decentralized private Network so think of this similar to a blockchain network where you have a bunch of different nodes that are running around the world that are owned independently I mean they could be owned by a company but not one company controls all of the individual nodes and when you connect to this decentralized private Network you're connecting to a bunch of different nodes that are running around the world now the more people that connect to this the more nodes that exist and the faster the network gets so as it gets bigger and bigger it actually gets more performant and more efficient to run now this is in contrast to a regular VPN where let's say you use some popular VPN company right what's going to happen is you're connecting to their servers which are owned by them controlled by them and that means theoretically behind the scenes if they want to they can apply censorship they can view your different data they have access to all of it on the servers that you're connecting to so you're really trusting this third party or this company to keep all of your data safe and we've seen in the past that whenever we trust one large corporation there can be some some problems that occur with that I won't get into that too far in this video so anyways this is fully decentralized I like all the decentralized stuff I am a believer in that going forward hence what I'm sharing with you here now just you can see how this thing works I'm going to plug it into my computer right now and I'll show you how simple the setup is all right so I'm on my computer now I've got the device plugged in and I'll just quickly walk you through a bit of the setup and show you kind of the panel and all the configuration options you get so you can actually connect this in two ways the first way is the WiFi dongle mode which is what I'm using right now where you just plug it into the computer and the second way is Wireless relay mode where this creates a network that you can connect to from your phone from any other device or maybe you can't actually plug this thing in okay so those are the two modes we're running in WiFi dongle mode and all you do is plug the thing in wait for the light to change the right color and then you go to this IP address here you sign in and then you just scan for your network connect your network it connects from that physical Hardware device think of it as another like network interface card and then you can simply start using it right so I'll show you if I go to this IP address here I'm connected to it notice in the bottom right hand up corner of my screen it says internet access network 11. but I don't have WiFi on and I don't have any ethernet cable plugged in so it is running off this device and if we come here you can view information about the memory CPU usage all of the ads that it's blocking so it blocks ads on websites like YouTube which is super useful and then if you go to something like the ad or starting to add app relocator you can actually change your server for a bunch of different apps meaning when I connect to Netflix it can automatically connect me to a US server when I connect to Disney plus maybe it connects me to an Asian server I can change so that way it automatically happens for me every time I go to those sites I don't have to manually change the network which is really nice or the server sorry so actually to show you a quick use case of this I've just unplugged the device and you can see the now I'm on peacock TV and I'm unable to access this site if I click on get started or sign in you see it just keeps bringing me to this page because I'm located in Canada and in Canada you can't access this streaming service so now what I'll do is plug the device back in change my location and show you that this will now work for me alright so I've plugged the device back in now and what I'm going to do is go over to the app relocator and notice here that now peacock is on United States rather than Canada so what I can do now is go back to Peacock TV so let's search for that here click on it and you'll see that now we can actually access this now I don't have a subscription but notice I'm not getting that unavailable page because now it's looking like I'm in the United States in terms of things like music we have access to these different apps flight and hotel subscription and why this is cool is because a lot of companies do price discrimination meaning I can actually connect out of somewhere like India and I can buy subscriptions at like onefifth the cost that would normally cost to be in Canada so super cool a lot of other settings here I'm not going to go through all of it but we have things like an ad blocker you can get more complicated here with DNS filters https filters anyways you guys can mess around with this on your own if you do decide to get the product but just to prove this is working I can type something like yo it's gonna pop up it's functioning it's actually super fast uh and yeah that's pretty much all I had to show you so that said I think I'm gonna start wrapping it up here if you are interested in this product there will be a link in the description I know that this was a sponsored video but this is a really interesting product that I've been using ever since I got it super fast super impressed but and definitely something I'm going to continue to use I hope this video gave you guys a good amount of value if it did make sure to leave a like subscribe the channel I will see you in the next one foreign
