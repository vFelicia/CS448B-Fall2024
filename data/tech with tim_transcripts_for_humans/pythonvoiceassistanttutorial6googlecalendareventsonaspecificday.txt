With timestamps:

00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so what we're
00:02 - gonna be doing in this video is just
00:03 - changing a few things to kind of
00:04 - optimize this code to make a little bit
00:06 - better because I've recently found out
00:08 - because of you guys continually
00:09 - commenting this and I apologize I didn't
00:11 - fix this sooner is that I should really
00:13 - be using a different module for doing
00:15 - the speaking for the computer so rather
00:18 - than using Google Texas Beach which is
00:19 - kind of slow and requires the Internet
00:21 - there's actually a module called pi TTS
00:24 - x3 that works really well in that I've
00:27 - actually tested down we're gonna switch
00:28 - to right now it's not gonna take us very
00:29 - long before I continue though I just
00:31 - want to fix a few errors that you guys
00:33 - pointed out to me in the last video so
00:34 - the first one is I need to add an ND to
00:37 - this day extensions list because you
00:39 - know if we have like second we need to
00:40 - add that which I forgot about I also
00:43 - need to add the month October because
00:44 - apparently I forgot to that so let's add
00:47 - that in here get those errors fixed up
00:49 - and now what I want to do is actually
00:51 - change to PI T TS X 3 and for doing the
00:56 - speaking from the computer so to do that
00:58 - we're gonna start by installing it so
01:00 - pip install PI T TS X 3 which I believe
01:05 - this means like version 3 of Pi
01:06 - text-to-speech we'll hit enter install
01:09 - that I already have it installed now
01:11 - what I'm gonna do is actually on import
01:13 - our gets get rid of these imports for
01:14 - play sound in Google Texas speech and
01:17 - instead import PI TTS X 3 so that means
01:21 - inside of speak now this function we
01:23 - need to change this and you're gonna see
01:25 - how much easier this is to actually
01:26 - speak something out it's not necessarily
01:29 - less code it's just like way simpler the
01:31 - process we're in create a variable
01:33 - called engine and that's gonna be equal
01:35 - to PI
01:35 - TTS x 3.9 it this is just starting pi
01:40 - TTS getting it ready to go
01:42 - and you need to do this every time
01:43 - you're about to speak something new is
01:45 - which is what I found out next we're
01:47 - gonna do is engine dot say and here
01:51 - we're just gonna say the text and let me
01:53 - make sure that that's the correct one
01:54 - but I think it is and then the last
01:57 - thing we need to do here is do engine
01:58 - dot and I believe this one is run and
02:02 - wait like that so this will run and wait
02:06 - for this text to finish being spoke
02:08 - until we move on to the next part of our
02:09 - program so this is just way easier and
02:11 - that's we're gonna use we don't need to
02:12 - save anything too
02:13 - file now so I can actually get rid of
02:14 - this voice mp3 file okay wonderful so
02:18 - now that we've done that let's actually
02:19 - just show you how this works by just
02:22 - speaking you know like hello Tim how are
02:25 - you and let's see what this sounds like
02:28 - how are you there you go so pretty fast
02:31 - but that's fine we can deal with that
02:34 - and I think there's probably a way to
02:35 - slow it down but I mean you guys can
02:37 - look up the documentation if you want to
02:39 - do that okay so now that we've done that
02:41 - that what we're actually gonna do is
02:44 - modify this get of Ben's function so
02:47 - that we can actually pass it a date one
02:49 - that we're gonna get from this get date
02:50 - function that we've been working on so
02:52 - hard for the past two videos and it will
02:54 - give us the list of events that occur on
02:57 - that date now that's gonna be great
02:59 - because what we can do then is we can
03:01 - you know speak to the computer we can
03:03 - figure out what day we're talking about
03:04 - and if we're asking about you know do we
03:06 - have an event on this day or are we busy
03:08 - do we have plans we can call this get
03:10 - events function give it the date we're
03:12 - talking about and then it'll figure out
03:13 - what we have on that day now it's a
03:15 - little bit tricky but what I'm gonna do
03:17 - is just start by replacing n with date
03:20 - up there we're gonna get rid of a few
03:21 - things like these first three lines and
03:24 - we're also going to get rid of this Max
03:27 - result parameter inside of events
03:29 - results service whatever this all is now
03:32 - we're gonna change this quite a bit the
03:34 - first thing that we need to do is you
03:35 - need to determine how this date is
03:38 - coming in and put it in the correct
03:40 - format so that we can actually pass it
03:42 - to this Google Calendar API like I guess
03:45 - query call whatever it is to get I mean
03:48 - like the correct format so essentially
03:50 - need to send in a date that's in like
03:51 - some UTC time format what we've done
03:54 - here is just gotten a date in terms of
03:58 - like you know the day the year in the
03:59 - month so we need to turn this into like
04:01 - a UTC timestamp which is kind of weird
04:04 - but I'm gonna show you how to do that
04:06 - now I'm gonna be quite honest I don't
04:08 - know like exactly what a lot of these
04:09 - lines do I was just messing around and I
04:12 - mean I know what the end result is but I
04:14 - don't work with the day time module very
04:16 - much so I can't really explain all of
04:17 - this
04:17 - but what we're gonna do is start by
04:19 - actually combining this date time we're
04:24 - gonna do date equals date time dot date
04:26 - time
04:27 - dot combined and then we're gonna do the
04:30 - day and date time is this just this
04:34 - isn't day sorry this is date yes or a
04:37 - new date date time dot min or was it
04:42 - sorry dot date time dot min dot time now
04:48 - this reminds me actually to change this
04:50 - parameter today and change this today
04:52 - that's what I have my other codes will
04:53 - stay consistent now I'm actually gonna
04:55 - copy this for date and I'm gonna make a
04:58 - new variable called end underscore date
05:00 - and what I'm gonna do here is this ever
05:03 - doing min time I'm gonna do max time so
05:05 - essentially what I need to do is I need
05:07 - to get two times I need to get our two
05:10 - date time objects one that has the
05:12 - beginning of the day so let's say we're
05:13 - talking about Tuesday I need Tuesday at
05:15 - like I guess what is it midnight like
05:19 - Tuesday at as soon as it hits Tuesday I
05:21 - need that time so the minimum time on
05:23 - Tuesday and then I need the maximum time
05:25 - on Tuesday so like 11:59 p.m. so what I
05:28 - can do is search through my the events
05:30 - in my Google Calendar so I only find the
05:32 - ones that occur in between those two
05:35 - times so that's why I'm doing this end
05:36 - date and this date alright so now that I
05:39 - have that this reminds me I need to
05:41 - actually go up here and import one more
05:42 - module this is built into Python but
05:44 - it's called PI T Zed I believe is the
05:48 - name of it and this is gonna allow us to
05:49 - actually get our current UTC time zone
05:52 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to say
05:53 - UTC equals pi t z dot e UTC which i
05:58 - believe just gives our current UTC time
06:00 - zone and that's gonna be different
06:02 - depending on wherever you live and then
06:04 - what I'm gonna do is say date equals
06:06 - date dot as time zone UTC and I'm gonna
06:12 - do the same thing for end underscore
06:14 - dates equals and underscore date dot as
06:17 - time zone like that and then UTC now
06:22 - what this is gonna do is just turn this
06:24 - into some UTC formatted date string
06:26 - which we actually need to pass into here
06:29 - and now what we're gonna do is we're
06:30 - gonna change this time in parameter to
06:33 - be date because that's the one with the
06:35 - minimum time we're gonna add one more
06:36 - parameter which is time
06:39 - which is going to be equal to and
06:41 - underscore a date like that okay so now
06:45 - that we have that this should actually
06:47 - work if we pass it a day and we pass it
06:49 - the service to give us all of the events
06:52 - that we have on that specific day so
06:54 - we're gonna test this out to start and
06:58 - yeah let's let's test it out
07:01 - so we're gonna get a date from strings
07:03 - we're going to select text equals get
07:05 - underscore audio and then what we're
07:07 - gonna do is just pass this to get event
07:09 - since we're going to say get underscore
07:10 - events and we're gonna do get underscore
07:14 - date text and then pass it text or not
07:20 - texter what am I saying we need to pass
07:21 - it service so we also need to get
07:22 - service so we'll say service equals get
07:27 - our authenticate to Google like that and
07:29 - it will pass it this service okay
07:33 - wonderful so now that we have that let's
07:35 - run this and see if this works properly
07:38 - so I'll say like what do I have on
07:39 - Wednesday or something and see if I have
07:40 - any events then what do I have on
07:43 - Wednesday and we get an error what is
07:49 - this let's see here we get an issue with
07:54 - this let me have a quick look and I'll
07:55 - be right back okay so I just remembered
07:57 - actually forgot one thing that I need to
07:59 - add here so for when I'm actually
08:01 - passing these dates I need to actually
08:03 - add something to them that is this weird
08:05 - thing it's is a format we did in the
08:08 - last video but I just forgot about it so
08:10 - is a format which is formats them
08:12 - properly I don't really know exactly how
08:14 - all this formatting is supposed to work
08:15 - it's kind of weird because you know what
08:17 - times you have different time zones and
08:18 - all that but now if we run this we
08:21 - should hopefully get something that
08:22 - actually works all right so I'm just
08:24 - signing in to my other Google account
08:25 - now and I'm gonna test this out and show
08:27 - you how this works so what I'm gonna do
08:29 - is run the program do I have anything on
08:32 - Thursday and what you can see is it
08:38 - actually pops up my entire schedule for
08:40 - Thursday here which is correct it means
08:42 - I have a lecture a lab a tutorial and a
08:45 - DGD now for those of you unaware what
08:48 - this means I'm in school right now so
08:49 - these are like my course codes and times
08:51 - that they
08:52 - Pinet um what we're gonna do in the next
08:54 - video is actually make this speak it out
08:56 - to us rather than just showing us what
08:58 - we have but I mean I think this is
09:00 - pretty cool so far that we can actually
09:02 - just speak into the computer you know
09:04 - ask it like what do I have on a specific
09:06 - day and it can actually attach that
09:07 - information for us I know a quick thing
09:09 - here that I want to do is just inside of
09:11 - this function I noticed that sometimes
09:14 - we get an error if you know there's no
09:16 - date that it finds so what we want to do
09:18 - is just do a quick if statement here
09:20 - before this last return that says if
09:22 - month equals equals negative 1 which
09:27 - means essentially we haven't figured out
09:28 - a month then what we need to do is or if
09:32 - month equals equals negative 1 or day
09:34 - equals equals negative 1 we're just
09:36 - gonna return none so we'll return none I
09:39 - don't know why this is lagging all right
09:41 - so sub-line text was lagging there so
09:43 - I'd restart but anyways we're just gonna
09:44 - return none here which essentially is
09:46 - saying you know if we've gone through
09:48 - this and we didn't find a date so we
09:49 - didn't find a month we didn't find a day
09:51 - return non grouted than running this
09:53 - because this code will actually return
09:55 - an error to us as it tries to create a
09:57 - date with a negative month right because
09:59 - month starts at negative 1 so noise that
10:02 - has been it for this video in terms of
10:04 - actually getting you know the events
10:06 - that we have on a specific day simply by
10:07 - speaking to the computer the next one
10:09 - we're gonna modify this function so it
10:10 - actually speaks back to us and tells us
10:12 - you know you have an event at 3 p.m. or
10:14 - whatever it is and yeah so if you guys
10:17 - have any ideas as always leave them in
10:18 - the comments down below and I will see
10:20 - you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back so what we're gonna be doing in this video is just changing a few things to kind of optimize this code to make a little bit better because I've recently found out because of you guys continually commenting this and I apologize I didn't fix this sooner is that I should really be using a different module for doing the speaking for the computer so rather than using Google Texas Beach which is kind of slow and requires the Internet there's actually a module called pi TTS x3 that works really well in that I've actually tested down we're gonna switch to right now it's not gonna take us very long before I continue though I just want to fix a few errors that you guys pointed out to me in the last video so the first one is I need to add an ND to this day extensions list because you know if we have like second we need to add that which I forgot about I also need to add the month October because apparently I forgot to that so let's add that in here get those errors fixed up and now what I want to do is actually change to PI T TS X 3 and for doing the speaking from the computer so to do that we're gonna start by installing it so pip install PI T TS X 3 which I believe this means like version 3 of Pi texttospeech we'll hit enter install that I already have it installed now what I'm gonna do is actually on import our gets get rid of these imports for play sound in Google Texas speech and instead import PI TTS X 3 so that means inside of speak now this function we need to change this and you're gonna see how much easier this is to actually speak something out it's not necessarily less code it's just like way simpler the process we're in create a variable called engine and that's gonna be equal to PI TTS x 3.9 it this is just starting pi TTS getting it ready to go and you need to do this every time you're about to speak something new is which is what I found out next we're gonna do is engine dot say and here we're just gonna say the text and let me make sure that that's the correct one but I think it is and then the last thing we need to do here is do engine dot and I believe this one is run and wait like that so this will run and wait for this text to finish being spoke until we move on to the next part of our program so this is just way easier and that's we're gonna use we don't need to save anything too file now so I can actually get rid of this voice mp3 file okay wonderful so now that we've done that let's actually just show you how this works by just speaking you know like hello Tim how are you and let's see what this sounds like how are you there you go so pretty fast but that's fine we can deal with that and I think there's probably a way to slow it down but I mean you guys can look up the documentation if you want to do that okay so now that we've done that that what we're actually gonna do is modify this get of Ben's function so that we can actually pass it a date one that we're gonna get from this

explain all of this but what we're gonna do is start by actually combining this date time we're gonna do date equals date time dot date time dot combined and then we're gonna do the day and date time is this just this isn't day sorry this is date yes or a new date date time dot min or was it sorry dot date time dot min dot time now this reminds me actually to change this parameter today and change this today that's what I have my other codes will stay consistent now I'm actually gonna copy this for date and I'm gonna make a new variable called end underscore date and what I'm gonna do here is this ever doing min time I'm gonna do max time so essentially what I need to do is I need to get two times I need to get our two date time objects one that has the beginning of the day so let's say

time on Tuesday so like 1159 p.m. so what I can do is search through my the events in my Google Calendar so I only find the ones that occur in between those two times so that's why I'm doing this end date and this date alright so now that I have that this reminds me I need to actually go up here and import one more module this is built into Python but it's called PI T Zed I believe is the name of it and this is gonna allow us to actually get our current UTC time zone so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to say UTC equals pi t z dot e UTC which i believe just gives our current UTC time zone and that's gonna be different depending on wherever you live and then what I'm gonna do is say date equals date dot as time zone UTC and I'm gonna do the same thing for end underscore dates equals and underscore date dot as time zone like that and then UTC now what this is gonna do is just turn this into some UTC formatted date string which we actually need to pass into here and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna change this time in parameter to be date because that's the one with the minimum time we're gonna add one more parameter which is time which is going to be equal to and underscore a date like that okay so now that we have that this should actually work if we pass it a day and we pass it the service to give us all of the events that we have on that specific day so we're gonna test this out to start and yeah let's let's test it out so we're gonna get a date from strings we're going to select text equals get underscore audio and then what we're gonna do is just

also need to get service so we'll say service equals get our authenticate to Google like that and it will pass it this service okay wonderful so now that we have that let's run this and see if this works properly so I'll say like what do I have on Wednesday or something and see if I have any events then what do I have on Wednesday and we get an error what is this let's see here we get an issue with this let me have a quick look and I'll be right back okay so I just remembered actually forgot one thing that I need to add here so for when I'm actually passing these dates I need to actually
