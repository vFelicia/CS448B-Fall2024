00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video what I'm redoing is sharing
00:03 - with you some beginner machine learning
00:05 - projects and explaining to you how to go
00:07 - about solving these projects as well as
00:09 - including the datasets that are with
00:11 - them so for all these projects I have
00:12 - datasets linked down below so you don't
00:15 - have to go searching for the datasets
00:17 - you can just download them use them in
00:19 - practice right away and that's the whole
00:21 - point in this video is to make sure
00:22 - everything is kind of here for you guys
00:23 - and that you can get everything right
00:25 - from this video you don't feel searching
00:26 - for how to find this information in this
00:28 - data which typically is the hardest part
00:30 - when you're trying to practice machine
00:31 - learning so with that being said let's
00:33 - get into the video and talk about some
00:35 - machine learning projects for beginners
00:36 - before we get started I need to thank
00:38 - simply learn for sponsoring this video
00:40 - and providing all of you with 10% off

00:50 - Syfy pandas scikit-learn and matplotlib
00:52 - you'll learn the essential concepts of
00:54 - Python programming and gain deep
00:56 - knowledge in data analytics machine
00:58 - learning data visualization web scraping
01:00 - and natural language processing you'll
01:02 - apply these skills and for real-life
01:04 - industry-based projects and you'll be
01:06 - eligible to receive an IBM simply learn
01:08 - joint certificate after completing 85%
01:11 - of the course you can use the discount
01:12 - code tech with tim and sign up at the
01:14 - link below alright so the first project
01:16 - I recommend is using linear regression
01:18 - this is a basic algorithm if you don't
01:21 - know this and you can save yourself a
01:22 - beginner machine learning user or
01:24 - whatever it is
01:25 - learn this algorithm it's very
01:27 - straightforward and it's very powerful
01:29 - for doing things like I'm about to talk
01:30 - about here so I have a data set down
01:32 - below that includes information about
01:34 - students and their grades and what I'm
01:37 - tasking you guys with as a project idea
01:39 - here is using that data set try to
01:42 - predict a student's final grade now it
01:44 - has information like absences amount of
01:47 - hour studied I think it's like time
01:49 - watching TV siblings a bunch of
01:51 - information in there and what you're
01:52 - gonna have to do is kind of look through
01:54 - this data set and first determine what
01:56 - information do I need so what is
01:58 - actually gonna make sense for me to
02:00 - predict a student's final grade with
02:02 - this information what should I use then
02:04 - after that you're gonna have to train a
02:06 - linear regression model to make this
02:08 - prediction and you should be looking to
02:10 - predict you know an exact integer value
02:12 - or an exact desc
02:13 - values so I believe the grades are from
02:15 - 1 to 20 where it's like every one point
02:19 - is like a half point of a grade or
02:21 - something I don't know exactly how it
02:22 - works but you guys can look at the data
02:23 - set understand it and try to do that
02:25 - this is pretty straightforward and if
02:26 - you're having trouble with this I
02:27 - actually do have a complete tutorial on
02:29 - how to do this and I will leave a card
02:31 - or like a link in the description to
02:33 - that so you can have a look at that for
02:34 - reference as well alright so project
02:36 - number two so now that we've used linear
02:38 - regression a pretty basic algorithm it's
02:41 - time to kind of move into a different
02:42 - flavor of machine learning which is
02:45 - clustering and classification so for
02:47 - this one I'm gonna recommend you use K
02:49 - nearest neighbors to do this and to
02:51 - recommend or not recommend but to
02:53 - classify cars as either safe or not safe
02:56 - based on data about those cars now I
02:59 - have a data set down below and again
03:00 - you're gonna have to follow the same
03:01 - procedure at first understanding what
03:03 - this data set is and how it works and
03:05 - I'll leave the links to the original
03:06 - data sets you can read that but
03:08 - essentially this data set has
03:09 - information like the safety rating or
03:11 - like the amount of doors just many
03:14 - different things about a car and then it
03:16 - also has you know how safe that car is
03:19 - so using this information you know try
03:21 - to be able to pass a few parameters to
03:23 - your model that can predict based on
03:25 - some certain information if this car is
03:28 - going to be rated as safe or not safe
03:30 - this is a cool one because it doesn't
03:32 - involve you know predicting a number
03:34 - value and some of this information
03:35 - you could probably omit and you need to
03:37 - kind of encode it into integers because
03:39 - the information is not just like 0 1 2 3
03:41 - it's like safe not safe like accuracy
03:45 - very high like it has words and it so
03:47 - you need to deal with that information
03:48 - which is something that you're gonna
03:49 - have to learn as you get better with
03:51 - machine learning and it's a good way to
03:53 - practice kind of you know encoding this
03:55 - information same thing here I have a
03:57 - tutorial on this I will leave a link
03:58 - down below so you guys can reference
03:59 - that if you're having trouble alright to
04:01 - machine learning project number 3
04:04 - classifying cancer tumors as benign or
04:07 - malignant I believe that's how you say
04:09 - that so essentially cancerous or
04:10 - non-cancerous now this I think you can
04:13 - probably assume why this might be a cool
04:14 - project first of all this is a pretty
04:16 - good application if we can look at a
04:18 - tumor and based on some certain
04:20 - properties on it be able to use machine
04:21 - learning to determine whether or not
04:23 - this is cancerous or not which is
04:25 - actually what doctors use all the
04:27 - time is a bunch of machine learning an
04:28 - AI to help them do these kind of
04:30 - analysis but anyways there's a very
04:32 - popular data set I believe it's just
04:34 - called like the cancer data set or
04:36 - something like that that I've linked
04:37 - down below and using this data set again
04:39 - it has a ton of different properties I
04:41 - want to say it's like 30 or something
04:42 - pick out which ones might be important
04:45 - to classify tumor information to
04:48 - classified as cancerous or non-cancerous
04:49 - now notice I haven't given you a model
04:52 - to use for this I haven't said you know
04:54 - use this algorithm or use this and
04:56 - that's because you can use different
04:57 - algorithms to do this now I would
05:00 - recommend possibly some kind of
05:01 - unsupervised algorithm maybe a neural
05:04 - network maybe some kind of clustering
05:05 - algorithm like k-means but you can do
05:07 - this in a few different ways and I'd be
05:09 - interested to see what you guys think
05:10 - you're gonna do for this so this is kind
05:12 - of amping up the difficulty a bit
05:13 - because you need to make the decision on
05:15 - which algorithm you should use to
05:17 - classify this data all right so now my
05:19 - last project idea for beginners this is
05:22 - not very original whatsoever because
05:23 - this is kind of you know the hello world
05:26 - of machine learning but it is using
05:27 - neural networks to classify the amnesty
05:30 - digit data set now if you're considering
05:33 - yourself a beginner here chances are you
05:34 - might have actually already done this
05:36 - but what I want you to do is try to do
05:37 - this by yourself so there is a data set
05:40 - it's the M nest digit data set
05:42 - essentially contains pixel data of a
05:45 - bunch of different images that are
05:47 - numbers so like handwritten digits like
05:48 - 0 through 9 and what you need to do is
05:52 - write some kind of ML algorithm using a
05:54 - neural network or whatever it is you
05:55 - want to use to classify these digits
05:57 - based on the pixel data so you're gonna
05:59 - have to figure out if you're using a
06:01 - neural network which is what I would
06:02 - recommend
06:03 - what is your input layer gonna be and
06:04 - then what is your output layer gonna be
06:06 - how are we going to encode this
06:07 - information how are we going to
06:08 - determine if a number is you know 0
06:10 - through 9 how are we gonna take these
06:12 - pixels that are two-dimensional so you
06:14 - have rows and you have columns and feed
06:16 - them into our neural network and this is
06:18 - a more complicated thing there's tons of
06:20 - tutorials online I have one on how to do
06:22 - this as well that you could follow if
06:24 - you're stuck but really just try to
06:26 - think about these because this is what
06:27 - you need to do to get better at machine
06:29 - learning and artificial intelligence a
06:30 - lot of it is not just writing the code
06:32 - but thinking about what should I use
06:34 - what's my input going to be what's my
06:36 - opiate gonna be how am I going to get
06:37 - this data nice and clean
06:39 - and how is all of this gonna work so
06:41 - anyways those are my kind of four
06:43 - project ideas for machine learning for
06:45 - beginners now if you guys have any other
06:47 - ideas for projects please don't hesitate
06:48 - to leave them down below as it can
06:50 - definitely help other people out with
06:52 - that being said if you guys enjoyed the
06:53 - video make sure you leave a like and

find this information in this data which typically is the hardest part when you're trying to practice machine learning so with that being said let's get into the video and talk about some machine
