00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the second video
00:02 - in my discord rewrite tutorials so today
00:05 - we're gonna be continuing where we left
00:06 - off with kind of sending messages adding
00:08 - some more commands we're gonna be
00:09 - talking about kind of getting specific
00:12 - things to a server like maybe how many
00:13 - members are on there who's online who's
00:15 - offline how we can check specific
00:17 - channels how we can check who is sending
00:20 - what message how we can mention members
00:21 - kind of going through a lot of the basic
00:24 - stuff but this will allow you to
00:25 - actually create a lot now before I
00:27 - continue what I want to talk about just
00:29 - is all this stuff is gonna be on my
00:31 - website so if you guys are like
00:32 - struggling with any of the code or you
00:34 - can't keep up with the pace that I'm
00:35 - going at just go to my website tech with
00:37 - tim ned go to this tutorials page you
00:39 - can just do that by clicking up here go
00:41 - to the discord bot section and then at
00:44 - the time of recording the side of the
00:46 - text-based version dumb-butt you'll be
00:48 - able to click on the text-based tutorial
00:49 - most likely right when this comes out so
00:52 - i'll show you for example with the first
00:53 - tutorial it was already out and you can
00:55 - kind of go through here and it explains
00:57 - everything that I'm doing the video just
00:58 - kind of like not as detailed and then
01:01 - they have I have all the code here that
01:02 - you can kind of copy as well if you run
01:04 - into any errors so I'm also just gonna
01:07 - talk about so what I do essentially when
01:08 - I teach these tutorials and what I
01:10 - learned is I just read the documentation
01:11 - so essentially what I did to learn
01:13 - rewrite is I just read through this
01:15 - entire documentation and then I kind of
01:17 - picked through the stuff that I think is
01:18 - important and that's not like super
01:21 - specific to a use case and then I teach
01:23 - that as like I don't know that that's
01:25 - just what I do right so you'll see me
01:27 - occasionally look over to my other
01:28 - screen because I just have the
01:29 - documentation open cuz I don't memorize
01:31 - this stuff I just look through and know
01:33 - how to use it so if you guys want to
01:34 - learn how to do a bunch of this stuff
01:36 - that I maybe don't talk about cuz look
01:38 - there's tons of stuff in here that you
01:39 - can do like I can't even begin to
01:41 - explain how powerful this module is just
01:43 - go to this link I leave it in the
01:44 - description and read through the
01:46 - documentation yourself now it's not
01:47 - gonna be as easy to do things as
01:49 - compared to watching me because I've
01:50 - already read through it and kind of show
01:52 - what's difficult and what's not but you
01:55 - can learn how to like maybe if you want
01:56 - to do sound and I don't talk about that
01:57 - till video 5 then you can read through
01:59 - this and maybe try to figure that out
02:01 - for yourself
02:02 - so essentially what we want to do in
02:04 - this tutorial is I already was playing
02:05 - around with the button here just to make
02:06 - sure everything's working but we want to
02:09 - get the server ID first now what we were
02:12 - doing the last video is we just
02:13 - I bought and it's on this server right
02:15 - but it could be on any server that we
02:17 - want and that means when we run the bot
02:19 - on any server it'll do the same thing
02:21 - now that's good in some cases but in
02:24 - other cases we need specific information
02:26 - to the server we're on for example the
02:28 - amount of members well that's going to
02:29 - be specific to the server so we need
02:31 - some way to access that value so to do
02:34 - that we actually need to get something
02:35 - called the server ID now to get that is
02:38 - well it's not challenging but it's not
02:40 - easy either so what I need you to do
02:41 - first of all let's go to your discord go
02:43 - to user settings not not like channel
02:45 - settings user settings and then you're
02:47 - gonna go to appearance and you're gonna
02:49 - scroll down to where you see developer
02:51 - mode now mine is already on but yours
02:54 - will most likely be off so you're gonna
02:56 - have to turn this on and even says your
02:58 - developer mode exposes context menu
03:00 - items helpful for people writing BOTS
03:02 - which is exactly what we're doing
03:03 - so we'll do that and then what we're
03:06 - gonna do is we're gonna go to our test
03:07 - server or whatever server you're working
03:08 - and obviously go to server settings and
03:10 - go to widget now if you clicked on
03:13 - widget before you might not have seen
03:14 - this page I can't promise you you did or
03:17 - not because I have like streamer mode
03:18 - enabled at some point so it's kind of
03:19 - weird but anyways you're gonna copy this
03:21 - value that's a server ID okay I don't
03:24 - think it's I don't think it matters if
03:25 - you guys know what my server ideas but
03:27 - anyways there you go so copy the server
03:30 - ID and now what we're gonna do is I'll
03:32 - just what do you call it exit out of
03:34 - this and I've already got a copied here
03:36 - but just copy it in so you have the
03:39 - server ID okay and what we're gonna do
03:41 - now is we're gonna type exactly this I
03:43 - figure out that I still have this typed
03:44 - rent type ID equals client don't get
03:48 - underscore guild and then that ID value
03:50 - which is you got exactly from the
03:52 - discord page right now we have a
03:54 - reference to our specific server so we
03:56 - can do things like count the amount of
03:58 - members so once you've done that what
04:01 - I'm gonna do now is going to add another
04:02 - command that's just gonna simply print
04:03 - out at the amount of members that are in
04:05 - our discord server so to do this we'll
04:07 - say L if message dot content equals
04:12 - equals and then in this case let's say
04:14 - users right and then this will just give
04:17 - us the amount of users or members in our
04:18 - server and obviously play with these if
04:21 - you want these to be something else you
04:22 - can make this like a - like you can do
04:24 - whatever command thing and you can even
04:25 - make it like that it doesn't
04:26 - to be with an exclamation point I'm just
04:28 - choosing to use that for my commands so
04:30 - now we're just going to await message
04:32 - dot channel dot send and then in here
04:36 - I'm actually going to use something
04:37 - called an F string so I'm gonna type F
04:39 - and then I'm gonna do three quotation
04:41 - marks and you can use this in regular
04:42 - Python as well but what we're gonna do
04:44 - now is I'm just gonna say we call it
04:48 - number of members and we're gonna put
04:52 - these little curly braces now you won't
04:54 - see these curly braces when you print
04:56 - it's just to declare that we're about to
04:57 - place a variable in here so that way we
04:59 - don't have to add like the pluses and
05:01 - the commas and do all that formatting
05:03 - for the string we can just kind of type
05:04 - it directly in which is really nice so
05:06 - we'll put these curly braces and then in
05:08 - here we're gonna do is gonna do ID dot
05:09 - member underscore count and since this
05:12 - is a reference to our server and by the
05:14 - way ID if this is giving you errors just
05:15 - change it to something else because it's
05:16 - a Python keyword but it should be fine
05:18 - and then we'll do member underscore
05:20 - count and they'll give us how many
05:21 - members are in our server so let's run
05:23 - this and see if I made any mistakes or
05:25 - not and now we're just gonna go I'm in
05:27 - the general thing here so we'll type
05:28 - users and you can see the number of
05:31 - members and it gives us the value of two
05:32 - because obviously we have our bought
05:34 - user and then Tim so sweet if we wanted
05:37 - we could add cool in here too cuz that
05:38 - is probably gonna annoy me all right so
05:40 - now we've got that so now how can we
05:43 - check what channel a users sending
05:45 - messages into for example in my my
05:48 - actual discord server so like tech with
05:50 - Tim here I only allow users to send like
05:53 - bought commands in the bought commands
05:55 - channel or the commands channel
05:56 - obviously they can still type this in
05:58 - other channels but if they do nothing's
06:00 - gonna happen so how can we do that so
06:02 - for example I only want to be able to
06:03 - send it in what one or two channels so
06:05 - Bach commands commands maybe mod so how
06:09 - can we choose those channels well first
06:10 - we're gonna have to actually say let me
06:12 - go back here to test server I need to
06:14 - create a new channel you're gonna call
06:16 - this commands okay and you can see it's
06:18 - a blank Channel you can add as many as
06:20 - you want if you want to play with
06:20 - multiple ones but essentially what we're
06:22 - gonna do is I'm gonna make a list of
06:23 - valid channels so I'm just gonna say it
06:25 - channels yeah
06:27 - channels equals hope that's not gonna
06:30 - give us any airs with anything okay
06:32 - channels equals and then we'll do
06:34 - commands now if you had another channel
06:38 - that you wanted to be able to send in
06:39 - here you do
06:40 - like maybe admin and you just type out
06:42 - the exact name and if it has a - like
06:44 - add the - you don't need the pound sign
06:46 - though you just need this okay and now
06:48 - what we'll do is before we send a bot
06:51 - reply we'll make sure that we're in a
06:52 - correct channel so what we could do is
06:54 - we can say if message dot channel
06:57 - because equals channels work not equals
07:00 - equals sorry in channels which
07:03 - essentially is just gonna check if it's
07:04 - either commands or anything else that's
07:06 - in this list will tab all this in and
07:08 - there we go so that should be working
07:11 - now I'm also just gonna throw a string
07:13 - around here I don't know if this will
07:14 - cause an error or not but I just want to
07:15 - be safe with her string and now let's
07:17 - just test this and see if everything's
07:19 - working so we're gonna discord we'll go
07:21 - to general and let's type hello and
07:25 - nothing's happening okay but that is I
07:27 - believe a command so now if I go here
07:29 - and I type below you can see that the
07:31 - bot responds with hi and if I do
07:33 - something like users it also responds
07:35 - with number of members to again if I try
07:37 - users in here it doesn't work because
07:40 - we're not in the correct channel so
07:42 - that's a really useful way to do things
07:43 - okay so the next thing I'm gonna do is
07:46 - I'm going to show you a new event and
07:47 - this is if a member joins so if a member
07:50 - joins your server likely you'd want to
07:52 - greet them you want to say hey welcome
07:53 - to the server and you want some
07:54 - personalized message that probably
07:56 - involves their name so to do this we're
07:58 - gonna do another client event decorator
08:00 - so I'll copy that and the the event this
08:03 - time is gonna be async so the same as
08:05 - before
08:06 - define on underscore member underscore
08:10 - join and this takes one parameter and I
08:13 - believe the parameter is member and yes
08:16 - awesome so member okay so what we're
08:19 - gonna do now is we're gonna mention this
08:21 - member in a message and we're gonna send
08:23 - it in a channel now the thing is though
08:25 - since this is only giving us the member
08:27 - of the joint is not giving us the
08:28 - channel they joined in we have to know
08:31 - what channel to uh
08:32 - to welcome them in so essentially 99% of
08:36 - you are probably gonna have all your
08:37 - members join through the general channel
08:39 - so that's probably gonna be the channel
08:40 - you want a message it right but for
08:42 - example if they were joining in the
08:44 - channel like I don't know like and you
08:47 - renamed it something else that wasn't
08:48 - general then you'd have to change what
08:51 - you're about to do here and I'll show
08:52 - you in one second I'm just gonna look at
08:54 - this okay so now what I'm gonna do is
08:56 - I'm just gonna make a folder I'm gonna
08:58 - say for channel in member dot server
09:03 - yes server dot channels and what this is
09:07 - gonna do is it's gonna get all of the
09:08 - channels that is in the server that the
09:11 - member joined okay so similar to kind of
09:13 - getting this guild we're just doing it
09:15 - in a different way and now we're gonna
09:17 - say if channel equals equals and then
09:21 - whatever the name of your what do you
09:24 - call it channel is and again I'll put
09:25 - string here I don't know if we need to
09:26 - do this but this is the way I did in my
09:28 - other code so we'll just use this for
09:30 - now so string channel equals equals
09:31 - general and this will mean we're only
09:33 - gonna send a message if it's in the
09:35 - general channel and now what we'll do is
09:37 - we'll say oh wait and then we'll do
09:39 - member server dot channels how should we
09:46 - do this or no I think it's like this
09:48 - client dot send should be something like
09:52 - this and then we can just say send
09:54 - underscore message there and then what
09:57 - we'll do is we'll we'll send like
09:59 - welcome to the server okay
10:01 - so I think I'm trying to understand what
10:03 - I did here I think this this works if
10:05 - channel equals general then we'll just
10:07 - send a message cuz we're in that channel
10:08 - that that should that makes sense to me
10:10 - but I sorry I'm having trouble to
10:12 - explain that so let you do another F
10:13 - string and then in here what we can do
10:16 - is well we got to add these other
10:17 - quotation marks I believe where's my
10:20 - quotation marks there we go and we'll
10:22 - just say welcome to the server and then
10:26 - in here we can say member dot mention
10:29 - and what this is going to do is it's
10:32 - gonna do that little at sign and it's
10:33 - going to like mention them so they get
10:35 - like a notification saying like welcome
10:37 - to the the server
10:38 - okay so testing this out will be
10:41 - interesting because I'm gonna have to
10:42 - either invite like another bot or
10:45 - something and see if that works
10:47 - okay you know what maybe we'll test this
10:49 - in another video but just just trust me
10:51 - on this one if it's working or you guys
10:52 - can you guys can tell me if it works or
10:53 - not and then I can tweak it in the next
10:56 - video alright but I'm pretty sure this
10:57 - should work for if a new member joins
10:59 - the server and I had it working on my
11:01 - sir
11:01 - I believe so you'll see that should work
11:03 - okay so what else could we possibly want
11:06 - to do okay so we figured out how we can
11:08 - get the channel you're sending it in but
11:10 - how about who's sending what like what
11:12 - if I only want myself to be able to use
11:14 - the bots well we can do that as well so
11:18 - we can say something like valid
11:19 - underscore user just equals two and then
11:22 - I look at a list and I'm gonna put my
11:24 - little tag in here nine to nine eight
11:28 - I think is my number and you do need
11:31 - this actual number sign otherwise this
11:32 - isn't gonna work so what I can do now is
11:34 - I can actually say and so we have this
11:37 - condition so if it's in the correct
11:39 - channel and the member is invalid users
11:41 - so to do this we'll say if the message
11:43 - dot author in and then again valid
11:49 - underscore users and one more time we'll
11:51 - convert this to string I don't know
11:52 - again if you have to do this you can
11:54 - play around without the string but let's
11:55 - see now if I get I guess we can't even
11:58 - test this anyways but anyways let's try
12:00 - this because I'm the only member in the
12:01 - server but let's do I don't know go to
12:05 - the correct channel unless type hello
12:07 - and see if it actually works there we go
12:08 - so high okay so now I want to see let's
12:11 - change this to a different name let's
12:13 - get rid of Tim and let's let's make it
12:14 - tea I just so it's easy to change back
12:16 - and now let's run this and see if it's
12:17 - still letting me send messages or not so
12:20 - now we're in the correct channel we say
12:21 - hello and nothing's happening it's not
12:23 - letting us send anything back so that
12:26 - was actually working correctly and this
12:27 - is how you can make like a list of valid
12:29 - users now you can also do this like
12:32 - based on rule like you can say if user
12:34 - dot role equals equals mod allow them to
12:36 - do this and I will go through that later
12:39 - but it's in the documentation where is
12:41 - it here if you want to look at how you
12:42 - can get roles and stuff it's somewhere
12:45 - you if you just look like roles then it
12:49 - should go through like all the different
12:50 - things on how to get that so changelog
12:52 - chain like you can read through that
12:54 - anyways okay so let's do this though so
12:57 - let's say you send a message and it
13:00 - doesn't let you are you in the wrong
13:01 - channel or you're not a valid user maybe
13:04 - you want to say something back to the
13:05 - user or maybe want to print something
13:07 - into the console so maybe we'll say like
13:08 - print and then we'll do another F string
13:11 - because these are just useful I'll say
13:15 - user and then whatever that username was
13:19 - so we'll say like message all thing
13:22 - tried to do command and then we'll put
13:28 - in here whatever that command was so
13:30 - message dot content so now we were doing
13:34 - is actually we're not gonna show
13:35 - anything to the user but we're gonna
13:36 - print to this log screen saying like
13:39 - this user was trying to do a command and
13:41 - we can just print that out so we can see
13:43 - what they're trying to do essentially
13:44 - right so let's break this let's change
13:47 - this so that it's actually gonna work
13:48 - because I am a valid user right now and
13:49 - we'll do this so we'll run and then
13:52 - we'll go here and we'll say like hello
13:56 - okay so now we come here and it says
13:58 - user Tim nine - nine eight tried to do
14:00 - command hello now we can also say what
14:02 - Chan will be tried to do it in so let's
14:04 - say in Channel and then again we can do
14:07 - message Channel and now we're have
14:11 - essentially like a log going within our
14:13 - command prompt here within our console
14:16 - so if I break this run this again and
14:19 - then do this one more time because the
14:21 - the channel would probably be useful so
14:22 - we'll do a whole load and then we'll
14:25 - just do another one in here and I'll say
14:27 - users then you can see Tim try to do
14:31 - command hello in channel commands Tim
14:34 - try to do command exclamation point
14:35 - users in channel general now the thing
14:38 - is right if I type anything it's still
14:41 - just gonna say that it's still gonna say
14:43 - what I tried to do and what think so
14:45 - watch this like if I just type hi it's
14:47 - gonna say I try to do the command hi
14:48 - even though it's not command and that's
14:50 - just because the way we have this if
14:51 - statement setup is we're only checking
14:53 - these things if they're valid user and
14:55 - this else statement right is only
14:57 - triggering if they're not avail user
14:58 - they're in the wrong channel so
15:00 - essentially that's what's gonna end up
15:01 - happening but I think I showed you guys
15:02 - enough to kind of get a grasp on how to
15:05 - do some stuff here to add your own
15:06 - commands do you send stuff back you can
15:08 - get the member account message content
15:10 - next video we're gonna do a lot more
15:12 - we're gonna get into like changing roles
15:13 - and nicknames and like all that fun
15:15 - stuff
15:16 - some more powerful things but I just
15:18 - wanted to give you guys kind of a
15:19 - beginning here again if you have any
15:20 - questions please join my discord tech
15:23 - with Tim you guys can see here if I go
15:25 - like - all these help channels like
15:26 - everyone's
15:27 - really helpful me go through and kind of
15:28 - help people with code and whatnot so I'm
15:30 - sure you'll be more than happy to help
15:32 - you I would as well follow me on Twitter
15:34 - and I will see you guys in the next
15:35 - video
15:36 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome to the second video in my discord rewrite tutorials so today we're gonna be continuing where we left off with kind of sending messages adding some more commands we're gonna be talking about kind of getting specific things to a server like maybe how many members are on there who's online who's offline how we can check specific channels how we can check who is sending what message how we can mention members kind of going through a lot of the basic stuff but this will allow you to actually create a lot now before I continue what I want to talk about just is all this stuff is gonna be on my website so if you guys are like struggling with any of the code or you can't keep up with the pace that I'm going at just go to my website tech with tim ned go to this tutorials page you can just do that by clicking up here go to the discord bot section and then at the time of recording the side of the textbased version dumbbutt you'll be able to click on the textbased tutorial most likely right when this comes out so i'll show you for example with the first tutorial it was already out and you can kind of go through here and it explains everything that I'm doing the video just kind of like not as detailed and then they have I have all the code here that you can kind of copy as well if you run into any errors so I'm also just gonna talk about so what I do essentially when I teach these tutorials and what I learned is I just read the documentation so essentially what I did to learn rewrite is I just read through this entire documentation and then I kind of picked through the stuff that I think is important and that's not like super specific to a use case and then I teach that as like I don't know that that's just what I do right so you'll see me occasionally look over to my other screen because I just have the documentation open cuz I don't memorize this stuff I just look through and know how to use it so if you guys want to learn how to do a bunch of this stuff that I maybe don't talk about cuz look there's tons of stuff in here that you can do like I can't even begin to explain how powerful this module is just go to this link I leave it in the description and read through the documentation yourself now it's not gonna be as easy to do things as compared to watching me because I've already read through it and kind of show what's difficult and what's not but you can learn how to like maybe if you want to do sound and I don't talk about that till video 5 then you can read through this and maybe try to figure that out for yourself so essentially what we want to do in this tutorial is I already was playing around with the button here just to make sure everything's working but we want to get the server ID first now what we were doing the last video is we just I bought and it's on this server right but it could be on any server that we want and that means when we run the bot on any server it'll do the same thing now that's good in some cases but in other cases we need specific information to the server we're on for example the amount of members well that's going to be specific to the server so we need some way to access that value so to do that we actually need to get something called the server ID now to get that is well it's not challenging but it's not easy either so what I need you to do first of all let's go to your discord go to user settings not not like channel settings user settings and then you're gonna go to appearance and you're gonna scroll down to where you see developer mode now mine is already on but yours will most likely be off so you're gonna have to turn this on and even says your developer mode exposes context menu items helpful for people writing BOTS which is exactly what we're doing so we'll do that and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our test server or whatever server you're working and obviously go to server settings and go to widget now if you clicked on widget before you might not have seen this page I can't promise you you did or not because I have like streamer mode enabled at some point so it's kind of weird but anyways you're gonna copy this value that's a server ID okay I don't think it's I don't think it matters if you guys know what my server ideas but anyways there you go so copy the server ID and now what we're gonna do is I'll just what do you call it exit out of this and I've already got a copied here but just copy it in so you have the server ID okay and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna type exactly this I figure out that I still have this typed rent type ID equals client don't get underscore guild and then that ID value which is you got exactly from the discord page right now we have a reference to our specific server so we can do things like count the amount of members so once you've done that what I'm gonna do now is going to add another command that's just gonna simply print out at the amount of members that are in our discord server so to do this we'll say L if message dot content equals equals and then in this case let's say users right and then this will just give us the amount of users or members in our server and obviously play with these if you want these to be something else you can make this like a like you can do whatever command thing and you can even make it like that it doesn't to be with an exclamation point I'm just choosing to use that for my commands so now we're just going to await message dot channel dot send and then in here I'm actually going to use something called an F string so I'm gonna type F and then I'm gonna do three quotation marks and you can use this in regular Python as well but what we're gonna do now is I'm just gonna say we call it number of members and we're gonna put these little curly braces now you won't see these curly braces when you print it's just to declare that we're about to place a variable in here so that way we don't have to add like the pluses and the commas and do all that formatting for the string we can just kind of type it directly in which is really nice so we'll put these curly braces and then in here we're gonna do is gonna do ID dot member underscore count and since this is a reference to our server and by the way ID if this is giving you errors just change it to something else because it's a Python keyword but it should be fine and then we'll do member underscore count and they'll give us how many members are in our server so let's run this and see if I made any mistakes or not and now we're just gonna go I'm in the general thing here so we'll type users and you can see the number of members and it gives us the value of two because obviously we have our bought user and then Tim so sweet if we wanted we could add cool in here too cuz that is probably gonna annoy me all right so now we've got that so now how can we check what channel a users sending messages into for example in my my actual discord server so like tech with Tim here I only allow users to send like bought commands in the bought commands channel or the commands channel obviously they can still type this in other channels but if they do nothing's gonna happen so how can we do that so for example I only want to be able to send it in what one or two channels so Bach commands commands maybe mod so how can we choose those channels well first we're gonna have to actually say let me go back here to test server I need to create a new channel you're gonna call this commands okay and you can see it's a blank Channel you can add as many as you want if you want to play with multiple ones but essentially what we're gonna do is I'm gonna make a list of valid channels so I'm just gonna say it channels yeah channels equals hope that's not gonna give us any airs with anything okay channels equals and then we'll do commands now if you had another channel that you wanted to be able to send in here you do like maybe admin and you just type out the exact name and if it has a like add the you don't need the pound sign though you just need this okay and now what we'll do is before we send a bot reply we'll make sure that we're in a correct channel so what we could do is we can say if message dot channel because equals channels work not equals equals sorry in channels which essentially is just gonna check if it's either commands or anything else that's in this list will tab all this in and there we go so that should be working now I'm also just gonna throw a string around here I don't know if this will cause an error or not but I just want to be safe with her string and now let's just test this and see if everything's working so we're gonna discord we'll go to general and let's type hello and nothing's happening okay but that is I believe a command so now if I go here and I type below you can see that the bot responds with hi and if I do something like users it also responds with number of members to again if I try users in here it doesn't work because we're not in the correct channel so that's a really useful way to do things okay so the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to show you a new event and this is if a member joins so if a member joins your server likely you'd want to greet them you want to say hey welcome to the server and you want some personalized message that probably involves their name so to do this we're gonna do another client event decorator so I'll copy that and the the event this time is gonna be async so the same as before define on underscore member underscore join and this takes one parameter and I believe the parameter is member and yes awesome so member okay so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna mention this member in a message and we're gonna send it in a channel now the thing is though since this is only giving us the member of the joint is not giving us the channel they joined in we have to know what channel to uh to welcome them in so essentially 99% of you are probably gonna have all your members join through the general channel so that's probably gonna be the channel you want a message it right but for example if they were joining in the channel like I don't know like and you renamed it something else that wasn't general then you'd have to change what you're about to do here and I'll show you in one second I'm just gonna look at this okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna make a folder I'm gonna say for channel in member dot server yes server dot channels and what this is gonna do is it's gonna get all of the channels that is in the server that the member joined okay so similar to kind of getting this guild we're just doing it in a different way and now we're gonna say if channel equals equals and then whatever the name of your what do you call it channel is and again I'll put string here I don't know if we need to do this but this is the way I did in my other code so we'll just use this for now so string channel equals equals general and this will mean we're only gonna send a message if it's in the general channel and now what we'll do is we'll say oh wait and then we'll do member server dot channels how should we do this or no I think it's like this client dot send should be something like this and then we can just say send underscore message there and then what we'll do is we'll we'll send like welcome to the server okay so I think I'm trying to understand what I did here I think this this works if channel equals general then we'll just send a message cuz we're in that channel that that should that makes sense to me but I sorry I'm having trouble to explain that so let you do another F string and then in here what we can do is well we got to add these other quotation marks I believe where's my quotation marks there we go and we'll just say welcome to the server and then in here we can say member dot mention and what this is going to do is it's gonna do that little at sign and it's going to like mention them so they get like a notification saying like welcome to the the server okay so testing this out will be interesting because I'm gonna have to either invite like another bot or something and see if that works okay you know what maybe we'll test this in another video but just just trust me on this one if it's working or you guys can you guys can tell me if it works or not and then I can tweak it in the next video alright but I'm pretty sure this should work for if a new member joins the server and I had it working on my sir I believe so you'll see that should work okay so what else could we possibly want to do okay so we figured out how we can get the channel you're sending it in but how about who's sending what like what if I only want myself to be able to use the bots well we can do that as well so we can say something like valid underscore user just equals two and then I look at a list and I'm gonna put my little tag in here nine to nine eight I think is my number and you do need this actual number sign otherwise this isn't gonna work so what I can do now is I can actually say and so we have this condition so if it's in the correct channel and the member is invalid users so to do this we'll say if the message dot author in and then again valid underscore users and one more time we'll convert this to string I don't know again if you have to do this you can play around without the string but let's see now if I get I guess we can't even test this anyways but anyways let's try this because I'm the only member in the server but let's do I don't know go to the correct channel unless type hello and see if it actually works there we go so high okay so now I want to see let's change this to a different name let's get rid of Tim and let's let's make it tea I just so it's easy to change back and now let's run this and see if it's still letting me send messages or not so now we're in the correct channel we say hello and nothing's happening it's not letting us send anything back so that was actually working correctly and this is how you can make like a list of valid users now you can also do this like based on rule like you can say if user dot role equals equals mod allow them to do this and I will go through that later but it's in the documentation where is it here if you want to look at how you can get roles and stuff it's somewhere you if you just look like roles then it should go through like all the different things on how to get that so changelog chain like you can read through that anyways okay so let's do this though so let's say you send a message and it doesn't let you are you in the wrong channel or you're not a valid user maybe you want to say something back to the user or maybe want to print something into the console so maybe we'll say like print and then we'll do another F string because these are just useful I'll say user and then whatever that username was so we'll say like message all thing tried to do command and then we'll put in here whatever that command was so message dot content so now we were doing is actually we're not gonna show anything to the user but we're gonna print to this log screen saying like this user was trying to do a command and we can just print that out so we can see what they're trying to do essentially right so let's break this let's change this so that it's actually gonna work because I am a valid user right now and we'll do this so we'll run and then we'll go here and we'll say like hello okay so now we come here and it says user Tim nine nine eight tried to do command hello now we can also say what Chan will be tried to do it in so let's say in Channel and then again we can do message Channel and now we're have essentially like a log going within our command prompt here within our console so if I break this run this again and then do this one more time because the the channel would probably be useful so we'll do a whole load and then we'll just do another one in here and I'll say users then you can see Tim try to do command hello in channel commands Tim try to do command exclamation point users in channel general now the thing is right if I type anything it's still just gonna say that it's still gonna say what I tried to do and what think so watch this like if I just type hi it's gonna say I try to do the command hi even though it's not command and that's just because the way we have this if statement setup is we're only checking these things if they're valid user and this else statement right is only triggering if they're not avail user they're in the wrong channel so essentially that's what's gonna end up happening but I think I showed you guys enough to kind of get a grasp on how to do some stuff here to add your own commands do you send stuff back you can get the member account message content next video we're gonna do a lot more we're gonna get into like changing roles and nicknames and like all that fun stuff some more powerful things but I just wanted to give you guys kind of a beginning here again if you have any questions please join my discord tech with Tim you guys can see here if I go like all these help channels like everyone's really helpful me go through and kind of help people with code and whatnot so I'm sure you'll be more than happy to help you I would as well follow me on Twitter and I will see you guys in the next video
