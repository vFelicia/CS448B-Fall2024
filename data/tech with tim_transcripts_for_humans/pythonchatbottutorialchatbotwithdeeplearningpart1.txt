With timestamps:

00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to a brand new
00:02 - tutorial series where I'm gonna be
00:04 - showing you how to build an AI chat bot
00:06 - in Python now it's a very simple chat
00:09 - bot but it does actually use neural
00:10 - networks and deep learning which means
00:12 - it is slightly intelligent but it's also
00:14 - very easy to kind of get working and get
00:17 - testing which a lot of the other chat
00:18 - pod tutorials I've seen hard not that
00:21 - easier at least I've tried to follow
00:22 - along with them and I can't get all the
00:23 - way through so I'm hoping that you guys
00:25 - are gonna be able to get through this
00:27 - with me if you have any questions
00:28 - throughout the tutorials feel free to
00:29 - leave a comment down below maybe myself
00:31 - or someone else would be able to help
00:32 - you you also join my discord server
00:34 - where people are always answering
00:36 - questions and helping each other out so
00:38 - let's talk about what this chat bot is
00:40 - how it works and our approach to kind of
00:42 - doing this throughout this tutorial so
00:44 - essentially what I wanted to do was
00:45 - create a chat bot that was used for a
00:47 - specific purpose so not just like a
00:49 - general chatting bought but something
00:51 - that maybe could help you answer
00:52 - questions about your business or maybe
00:53 - be a QA bot that answered like trivia
00:56 - questions or something like that or
00:57 - maybe a chat bot that your customers
01:00 - would type too and it gives them some
01:01 - kind of answer so really more an
01:03 - application based chat bot than just
01:05 - like talking in general now you can also
01:07 - make this chat bot talking but I'm going
01:09 - to show you right now how you customize
01:11 - it and how it kind of works so this is
01:14 - my chapo running right now this stuff
01:16 - will not be in like the final version
01:18 - this is just kind of a testing version
01:20 - so I haven't gone too far with it but
01:22 - you can see for example it typed like
01:23 - hey it's gonna respond with Hello if I
01:25 - say like what's up
01:27 - I got hi there how can I help you and
01:29 - just to note these are things that I'm
01:32 - typing in are not hard-coded into the
01:33 - chapo which means it's kind of figuring
01:35 - out what I'm asking and giving me an
01:37 - appropriate response if I say like how's
01:41 - your day you can see we get two
01:45 - responses just cuz it wasn't sure what I
01:46 - was typing there and then it says good
01:48 - to see you again so it's really easy to
01:50 - fine-tune this chat bot we'll talk about
01:52 - that later but let's do some more
01:53 - examples so if I say like what is your
01:57 - name says I'm Tim where I say like what
02:00 - should I call you I'm Tim aka tech with
02:05 - Tim now I set this up to kind of answer
02:07 - like some questions about a business so
02:08 - I like if I ask what or when are you
02:12 - open
02:12 - so yeah let me say we are open 7 a.m. to
02:17 - 4 p.m. Monday to Friday and you can code
02:19 - kind of whatever questions and whatever
02:21 - responses you want into this chat bot
02:23 - and make it as specific to your own use
02:25 - as you want and that's one of the
02:26 - reasons I really want to show this one
02:27 - because it's super customizable and you
02:30 - guys can very easily change it and we'll
02:31 - show you how it works so last thing I'll
02:33 - say like what is on the menu I'm
02:35 - pretending this is like a cookie shop I
02:37 - know it's a ridiculous shop but you guys
02:39 - get the point and says cookies are on
02:40 - the menu if I say how much is a cookie
02:45 - says 18 years young because I haven't
02:48 - coded anything that would like take in
02:50 - this response and and make sense of that
02:53 - so anyways that's kind of how the chat
02:55 - bar works you can see that it's
02:56 - obviously not amazing and it made a few
02:58 - simple mistakes but there's ways to
03:00 - tweak this and fix this and we'll be
03:01 - going through and kind of understanding
03:03 - how this works so let's close this up
03:05 - for right now and let's go to the data
03:07 - that our chat BOTS see so that chat pod
03:09 - that you guys just were looking at is
03:11 - trained on just this little bit of
03:13 - information now this actually wasn't
03:16 - trained into there that's why I didn't
03:17 - work when I said how much is cookie cuz
03:19 - I hadn't trained the chat before that um
03:21 - I just added that but anyways you guys
03:23 - will see we have what's known as a bunch
03:25 - of intense and then you can see we have
03:28 - patterns and responses so the patterns
03:30 - are what likely the user would type in
03:33 - so for example you could see hi how are
03:35 - you is anyone there hello good day
03:36 - what's up and then the response is an
03:39 - appropriate response to that kind of
03:41 - question or whatever the user typed now
03:43 - you can kind of see as we go through the
03:44 - different examples how they work but
03:46 - notice that I didn't type exactly what
03:48 - was typed here and the chaplet still
03:51 - came up with an appropriate answer for
03:53 - most of the things that i asked within
03:55 - within reason if the chapel was trained
03:57 - on that right like some of the things
04:00 - when I asked these here I didn't use the
04:02 - exact same thing it just figured it out
04:04 - and kind of worked and that's what we're
04:05 - gonna be aiming for in this series so we
04:08 - have essentially a group of intense and
04:10 - what our chat bot is going to attempt to
04:12 - do is take our message in and figure out
04:15 - what intent we want are we greeting are
04:17 - we saying goodbye are we asking for the
04:19 - age do we want name do we want the shop
04:21 - do want the hours that's what it's gonna
04:24 - try to figure out now this is really
04:26 - nice
04:26 - because a lot of other chatbots actually
04:28 - generated text response but you'll
04:30 - notice if you use any other chat bots
04:32 - that are really complex they oftentimes
04:34 - make mistakes and what they say doesn't
04:36 - really make sense so with this one you
04:37 - know you're gonna get an output that
04:39 - makes some kind of sense because you're
04:40 - hard-coding the outputs and you can also
04:43 - determine kind of how the chat bot works
04:45 - more specifically because you can code
04:47 - in all of the different intents so you
04:50 - can say well if I want this chat bot
04:51 - just to be maybe about selling like my
04:54 - knitting or something like that then you
04:55 - can code whatever would make sense for a
04:58 - user to type to that chat bot in
04:59 - anything else we could just have like
05:02 - another intent section there should be
05:03 - like I don't understand what you're
05:04 - saying or please ask another question or
05:06 - something like that so with all that
05:08 - being said that is how the chat bot
05:10 - works it's pretty simple in the next few
05:12 - tutorials we're gonna get through it and
05:13 - you guys will have a working chat bot
05:15 - that's fully customizable but let's talk
05:17 - about what we need to download and
05:18 - install to get this working so obviously
05:20 - we're gonna be using Python but we need
05:22 - to install a few Python modules now for
05:25 - this tutorial we need to be working with
05:27 - Python version 3.6 now 3.7 currently has
05:31 - a bug in it where it doesn't work with
05:32 - the TF learn module that I want to use
05:35 - for this tutorial so make sure you guys
05:37 - are running Python 3.6 if you're if you
05:40 - can and you're not running anaconda or
05:42 - anything like that
05:42 - uninstall any version of python you have
05:45 - right now and reinstall or install
05:47 - python 3.6 okay if you want to see what
05:50 - version of python you're running just
05:52 - type python and it will pop up your
05:54 - version you can see my version is 3.7
05:55 - but i'm not going to be using that
05:57 - version because i'm going to be using
05:58 - conda or anaconda which has python 3.6
06:02 - for it if you're using conda to create a
06:04 - new environment that has python 3.6 just
06:07 - do conda create - n give it a name in
06:10 - this case i just named mine chat bot and
06:12 - then say python equals 3.6 I'm not gonna
06:15 - go in-depth with how all this stuff
06:17 - works I'm just trying to get you guys
06:18 - set up now if you're using Conda
06:20 - activate that environment so in this
06:21 - case I already have one called chat bot
06:23 - so I'm gonna activate it if you're not
06:24 - using Conda just type whatever I'm about
06:26 - to type in the command prompt like this
06:29 - okay so what we're gonna do is need to
06:32 - install some modules so we're gonna use
06:33 - pip and the first module we need to
06:35 - install is a NLT kay now this
06:38 - is natural language toolkit which is
06:39 - gonna give us some nice functions to do
06:41 - some things with our words and trim them
06:43 - down and all that stuff so install this
06:45 - I already have it installed so I'm just
06:46 - gonna leave that if for some reason your
06:48 - pip isn't working I have a tutorial on
06:51 - my channel it's called how to install Pi
06:52 - game that will show you how to fix your
06:54 - pip I'll leave a card to it in the top
06:56 - corner of the screen right now so we'll
06:58 - do pip install um NLT Kay now will pip
07:01 - install numpy this is just gonna be used
07:04 - for some array management and stuff like
07:05 - that then after that we're gonna do pip
07:08 - install TF learn by the way you should
07:10 - be hitting Enter here I'm just Knox I
07:12 - already have it installed and finally
07:14 - we're gonna pip install tensorflow like
07:18 - that now if any of this doesn't work
07:19 - leave a comment down below I'll try to
07:21 - answer you go on Stack Overflow try to
07:23 - figure out the air but all of these
07:25 - commands should work if you're running
07:26 - Python 3.6 and you have pip working
07:29 - correctly on your machine now that we
07:31 - have that it is time to go to our main
07:34 - Python file and just start working with
07:36 - a little bit of code and actually sorry
07:38 - before we go to that I'm just gonna talk
07:40 - about this intense file one last time
07:42 - and how you guys need to be creating
07:44 - this so if you're following along and
07:45 - you want to follow along exactly with me
07:47 - you can download this intent file there
07:49 - will be a link in the description it may
07:51 - not be up right away remind me if you
07:53 - guys don't see it and I will add it into
07:54 - the description or just copy out the
07:57 - format that I have here by typing it out
07:59 - so if you want to start with just like
08:01 - one tag or something like that that's
08:02 - fine just do intense make sure that it
08:05 - looks the same so it has this squiggly
08:06 - bracket colon and then there's a list
08:09 - like this it's just like a Python
08:11 - dictionary and then we have dictionaries
08:13 - inside of here separated by commas and
08:15 - those have tag pointing to whatever the
08:18 - tag is and then patterns pointing to a
08:20 - list response pointing to a list in this
08:22 - context underscore set pointing to
08:24 - nothing right now which will change
08:25 - later so that's you need to do we need
08:28 - to get this kind of structure and make
08:30 - sure you save this file as a dot JSON
08:32 - file inside of your main Python
08:35 - directory or whatever your script is so
08:36 - in this case I'm you're working in main
08:38 - dot PI this is inside a folder so that
08:40 - means that the intent so Jason needs to
08:42 - be beside it or in the same directory as
08:44 - it so that we can you know work with it
08:46 - and loaded in
08:47 - so now we're going to start doing some
08:49 - imports and just reading in some write
08:51 - JSON data so we're gonna say import and
08:53 - ltk we're going to say from an LT k dot
08:57 - stem lancaster import land castor
09:03 - stemmer now i just messed up the
09:06 - capitals on that i so we'll fix that now
09:08 - now this is just gonna be used to stem
09:11 - our words which we're gonna talk about
09:12 - in a little bit and we're gonna say
09:13 - stammer equals in this case Lancaster's
09:17 - stemmer like that and we'll deal with
09:19 - that after now we're gonna import numpy
09:21 - so just go import numpy we're gonna
09:23 - import TF learn rapport TF learn import
09:27 - tensorflow we're gonna import random and
09:33 - we're going to import JSON now what
09:37 - we're gonna do is use JSON to read in
09:40 - this file and just loop through some of
09:41 - it and see all of our data and how we
09:43 - read that into the Python script because
09:45 - we need to use that to train our model
09:47 - so what we're gonna do now is we're
09:49 - gonna say with open and in this case
09:52 - we're just gonna type the name of our
09:53 - file so in this case intense dot JSON
09:55 - when I say as file now we're gonna say
10:00 - data equals in this case should be json
10:05 - dot load and then five so now if we
10:09 - print out data we should be seeing like
10:13 - a Python dictionary that looks exactly
10:14 - like this so let's try that I'm just
10:16 - gonna CD in to my directory here and run
10:19 - the python script if you guys are using
10:21 - ideally or whatever that's fine this
10:23 - will work the same CD into simple
10:26 - chatbots and then she go python maned up
10:30 - high i don't think that's gonna work
10:31 - maybe it will okay so there we go so
10:33 - that worked and now you can see that we
10:35 - have kind of this JSON data it's all
10:37 - bunched up and we can start accessing
10:39 - some of it so notice now if i do data
10:42 - and I type intense because that is what
10:46 - we've named this right here it should
10:47 - just show us all of the dictionaries as
10:49 - a post that main dictionary so let's run
10:51 - this now and let's see what we get and
10:54 - now you can see that we're getting all
10:56 - of these different lists so we have tag
10:58 - greeting patterns all about it we can
11:01 - accessing this just like you would
11:02 - access a Python dictionary so what we
11:05 - need to do now is we need to get all of
11:08 - these patterns and figure out what group
11:12 - they're in so in this case we're calling
11:13 - these tags but it can also be just
11:15 - groupings we're gonna need to get the
11:17 - responses and we just need to load all
11:19 - of that in so what I'm gonna do now is
11:22 - just start looping through this JSON
11:23 - data and doing just that so we're gonna
11:25 - say words equals a blank list we're
11:30 - gonna say classes or actually will not
11:33 - want to class will do labels labels
11:36 - equals a blank list will say docs equals
11:39 - that and there we go so now what I'm
11:42 - gonna do is I'm gonna say for intent in
11:45 - data and then in this case we're gonna
11:48 - say in tense now this is gonna do is
11:51 - loop through all of these dictionaries
11:53 - for us now the way that works is because
11:56 - we're looking at this list because we're
11:58 - saying
11:59 - data in tense then we're saying for
12:01 - every single intent in here which will
12:03 - give us all of these dictionaries which
12:05 - would be really easy and nice to loop
12:06 - through all these different patterns and
12:08 - all of that so now what we're gonna do
12:10 - we're gonna say for in this case pattern
12:14 - in intent and now remember this is a
12:19 - dictionary so we access the patterns
12:20 - registered patterns
12:22 - we're gonna do something specific with
12:24 - these patterns and this is known as
12:26 - stemming now this is the first part
12:29 - where we actually start understanding
12:30 - some of this kind of machine learning AI
12:32 - stuff for our chat BOTS now what
12:34 - stemming does is it's gonna take each
12:36 - word that's in our pattern so let's look
12:39 - at the words here and bring it down to
12:41 - the root word which means that for
12:43 - example is anyone there
12:45 - well if we're looking at the word there
12:47 - we're gonna say they're the root word of
12:50 - their question mark is just there so
12:52 - we're gonna remove this question mark if
12:53 - we have something like what's up we're
12:56 - gonna change this to just be what
12:57 - instead of what's right cuz we're gonna
13:00 - get the root of the word now the reason
13:02 - we you get the root of the word is
13:04 - because when we're training our model
13:06 - and our training our bot we don't really
13:08 - care about the other things attached to
13:10 - the word we just care about the main
13:11 - meaning of the word so by eliminating
13:13 - extra characters and things that might
13:16 - make the word different it's making our
13:18 - model that much more accurate because
13:20 - we're gonna ignore things that could
13:21 - stray the model in the wrong direction
13:23 - you guys understand more about how this
13:25 - works
13:26 - in future tutorials now to get all the
13:29 - different words in our patterns and to
13:31 - stem them we need to do something called
13:33 - tokenize now what tokenized means is
13:35 - just get all the words in our pattern
13:38 - it's the same thing as just splitting it
13:39 - by a space and getting all these
13:41 - different words but NL TK has a nice
13:43 - thing that does it for us and we're
13:44 - gonna use that and we're gonna say words
13:46 - or I will do like W RDS equals in this
13:50 - case n LT k dot word underscore
13:55 - tokenizer I think it is let's say oh
13:58 - just tokenized and then we're gonna put
14:00 - padding now this is gonna return to us a
14:02 - list with all of the different words in
14:04 - it and now what we're gonna do is we're
14:06 - simply gonna put all of these tokenized
14:08 - words into our words list now the reason
14:12 - we do this is because we want to know
14:14 - all of the different words that are in
14:16 - our intense file and we'll talk about
14:18 - that a bit later but that's what we're
14:21 - gonna do so just go say words dot extend
14:24 - and in this case W RDS now the reason we
14:28 - do this is because this is already a
14:29 - list so rather than looping through it
14:31 - and appending each one in we can just
14:33 - extend the list which means we're going
14:35 - to add all of those words in so now that
14:37 - we've done that the next thing that we
14:39 - need to do is we're gonna add to our
14:40 - Docs the pattern of words now what we're
14:45 - going to do to do this we're gonna say
14:46 - Docs dot append and in this case we're
14:48 - just going to append the pattern like
14:51 - that and that's all we need to do for
14:53 - that now finally we're gonna say if
14:55 - intent in this case tag which or yeah
15:01 - intent tag which will give us like these
15:03 - goodbye greetings
15:05 - age name in let's say labels or not in
15:10 - labels we'll need to do my back say not
15:13 - in labels then we're going to say the
15:14 - labels dot append and in this case
15:18 - intent
15:21 - now this way we're just gonna get all of
15:24 - the different tags that we have so
15:25 - greeting goodbye age name I guess we
15:30 - don't really need to do it like this per
15:33 - se we can just say if intent tag not in
15:36 - labels labels not append intent I don't
15:38 - know why I had that in the for loop in
15:40 - my other thing this should just work
15:41 - fine though to do that for us okay sweet
15:44 - so that's actually all we need to do
15:45 - right now for loading in all of our
15:47 - words and our labels and getting our
15:48 - documents ready with all the different
15:50 - patterns so I'm gonna leave the tutorial
15:52 - here in the next video what we're gonna
15:54 - do is do a little bit more on this data
15:56 - pre-processing and then we'll start
15:58 - working on creating our model and our
16:00 - training data and how all that's gonna
16:02 - work for our chatbot so if you guys
16:04 - enjoyed please make sure you leave a
16:06 - like and subscribe to the channel and I
16:08 - will see you again in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to a brand new tutorial series where I'm gonna be showing you how to build an AI chat bot in Python now it's a very simple chat bot but it does actually use neural networks and deep learning which means it is slightly intelligent but it's also very easy to kind of get working and get testing which a lot of the other chat pod tutorials I've seen hard not that easier at least I've tried to follow along with them and I can't get all the way through so I'm hoping that you guys are gonna be able to get through this with me if you have any questions throughout the tutorials feel free to leave a comment down below maybe myself or someone else would be able to help you you also join my discord server where people are always answering questions and helping each other out so let's talk about what this chat bot is how it works and our approach to kind of doing this throughout this tutorial so essentially what I wanted to do was create a chat bot that was used for a specific purpose so not just like a general chatting bought but something that maybe could help you answer questions about your business or maybe be a QA bot that answered like trivia questions or something like that or maybe a chat bot that your customers would type too and it gives them some kind of answer so really more an application based chat bot than just like talking in general now you can also make this chat bot talking but I'm going to show you right now how you customize it and how it kind of works so this is my chapo running right now this stuff will not be in like the final version this is just kind of a testing version so I haven't gone too far with it but you can see for example it typed like hey it's gonna respond with Hello if I say like what's up I got hi there how can I help you and just to note these are things that I'm typing in are not hardcoded into the chapo which means it's kind of figuring out what I'm asking and giving me an appropriate response if I say like how's your day you can see we get two responses just cuz it wasn't sure what I was typing there and then it says good to see you again so it's really easy to finetune this chat bot we'll talk about that later but let's do some more examples so if I say like what is your name says I'm Tim where I say like what should I call you I'm Tim aka tech with Tim now I set this up to kind of answer like some questions about a business so I like if I ask what or when are you open so yeah let me say we are open 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday and you can code kind of whatever questions and whatever responses you want into this chat bot and make it as specific to your own use as you want and that's one of the reasons I really want to show this one because it's super customizable and you guys can very easily change it and we'll show you how it works so last thing I'll say like what is on the menu I'm pretending this is like a cookie shop I know it's a ridiculous shop but you guys get the point and says cookies are on the menu if I say how much is a cookie says 18 years young because I haven't coded anything that would like take in this response and and make sense of that so anyways that's kind of how the chat bar works you can see that it's obviously not amazing and it made a few simple mistakes but there's ways to tweak this and fix this and we'll be going through and kind of understanding how this works so let's close this up for right now and let's go to the data that our chat BOTS see so that chat pod that you guys just were looking at is trained on just this little bit of information now this actually wasn't trained into there that's why I didn't work when I said how much is cookie cuz I hadn't trained the chat before that um I just added that but anyways you guys will see we have what's known as a bunch of intense and then you can see we have patterns and responses so the patterns are what likely the user would type in so for example you could see hi how are you is anyone there hello good day what's up and then the response is an appropriate response to that kind of question or whatever the user typed now you can kind of see as we go through the different examples how they work but notice that I didn't type exactly what was typed here and the chaplet still came up with an appropriate answer for most of the things that i asked within within reason if the chapel was trained on that right like some of the things when I asked these here I didn't use the exact same thing it just figured it out and kind of worked and that's what we're gonna be aiming for in this series so we have essentially a group of intense and what our chat bot is going to attempt to do is take our message in and figure out what intent we want are we greeting are we saying goodbye are we asking for the age do we want name do we want the shop do want the hours that's what it's gonna try to figure out now this is really nice because a lot of other chatbots actually generated text response but you'll notice if you use any other chat bots that are really complex they oftentimes make mistakes and what they say doesn't really make sense so with this one you know you're gonna get an output that makes some kind of sense because you're hardcoding the outputs and you can also determine kind of how the chat bot works more specifically because you can code in all of the different intents so you can say well if I want this chat bot just to be maybe about selling like my knitting or something like that then you can code whatever would make sense for a user to type to that chat bot in anything else we could just have like another intent section there should be like I don't understand what you're saying or please ask another question or something like that so with all that being said that is how the chat bot works it's pretty simple in the next few tutorials we're gonna get through it and you guys will have a working chat bot that's fully customizable but let's talk about what we need to download and install to get this working so obviously we're gonna be using Python but we need to install a few Python modules now for this tutorial we need to be working with Python version 3.6 now 3.7 currently has a bug in it where it doesn't work with the TF learn module that I want to use for this tutorial so make sure you guys are running Python 3.6 if you're if you can and you're not running anaconda or anything like that uninstall any version of python you have right now and reinstall or install python 3.6 okay if you want to see what version of python you're running just type python and it will pop up your version you can see my version is 3.7 but i'm not going to be using that version because i'm going to be using conda or anaconda which has python 3.6 for it if you're using conda to create a new environment that has python 3.6 just do conda create n give it a name in this case i just named mine chat bot and then say python equals 3.6 I'm not gonna go indepth with how all this stuff works I'm just trying to get you guys set up now if you're using Conda activate that environment so in this case I already have one called chat bot so I'm gonna activate it if you're not using Conda just type whatever I'm about to type in the command prompt like this okay so what we're gonna do is need to install some modules so we're gonna use pip and the first module we need to install is a NLT kay now this is natural language toolkit which is gonna give us some nice functions to do some things with our words and trim them down and all that stuff so install this I already have it installed so I'm just gonna leave that if for some reason your pip isn't working I have a tutorial on my channel it's called how to install Pi game that will show you how to fix your pip I'll leave a card to it in the top corner of the screen right now so we'll do pip install um NLT Kay now will pip install numpy this is just gonna be used for some array management and stuff like that then after that we're gonna do pip install TF learn by the way you should be hitting Enter here I'm just Knox I already have it installed and finally we're gonna pip install tensorflow like that now if any of this doesn't work leave a comment down below I'll try to answer you go on Stack Overflow try to figure out the air but all of these commands should work if you're running Python 3.6 and you have pip working correctly on your machine now that we have that it is time to go to our main Python file and just start working with a little bit of code and actually sorry before we go to that I'm just gonna talk about this intense file one last time and how you guys need to be creating this so if you're following along and you want to follow along exactly with me you can download this intent file there will be a link in the description it may not be up right away remind me if you guys don't see it and I will add it into the description or just copy out the format that I have here by typing it out so if you want to start with just like one tag or something like that that's fine just do intense make sure that it looks the same so it has this squiggly bracket colon and then there's a list like this it's just like a Python dictionary and then we have dictionaries inside of here separated by commas and those have tag pointing to whatever the tag is and then patterns pointing to a list response pointing to a list in this context underscore set pointing to nothing right now which will change later so that's you need to do we need to get this kind of structure and make sure you save this file as a dot JSON file inside of your main Python directory or whatever your script is so in this case I'm you're working in main dot PI this is inside a folder so that means that the intent so Jason needs to be beside it or in the same directory as it so that we can you know work with it and loaded in so now we're going to start doing some imports and just reading in some write JSON data so we're gonna say import and ltk we're going to say from an LT k dot stem lancaster import land castor stemmer now i just messed up the capitals on that i so we'll fix that now now this is just gonna be used to stem our words which we're gonna talk about in a little bit and we're gonna say stammer equals in this case Lancaster's stemmer like that and we'll deal with that after now we're gonna import numpy so just go import numpy we're gonna import TF learn rapport TF learn import tensorflow we're gonna import random and we're going to import JSON now what we're gonna do is use JSON to read in this file and just loop through some of it and see all of our data and how we read that into the Python script because we need to use that to train our model so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna say with open and in this case we're just gonna type the name of our file so in this case intense dot JSON when I say as file now we're gonna say data equals in this case should be json dot load and then five so now if we print out data we should be seeing like a Python dictionary that looks exactly like this so let's try that I'm just gonna CD in to my directory here and run the python script if you guys are using ideally or whatever that's fine this will work the same CD into simple chatbots and then she go python maned up high i don't think that's gonna work maybe it will okay so there we go so that worked and now you can see that we have kind of this JSON data it's all bunched up and we can start accessing some of it so notice now if i do data and I type intense because that is what we've named this right here it should just show us all of the dictionaries as a post that main dictionary so let's run this now and let's see what we get and now you can see that we're getting all of these different lists so we have tag greeting patterns all about it we can accessing this just like you would access a Python dictionary so what we need to do now is we need to get all of these patterns and figure out what group they're in so in this case we're calling these tags but it can also be just groupings we're gonna need to get the responses and we just need to load all of that in so what I'm gonna do now is just start looping through this JSON data and doing just that so we're gonna say words equals a blank list we're gonna say classes or actually will not want to class will do labels labels equals a blank list will say docs equals that and there we go so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say for intent in data and then in this case we're gonna say in tense now this is gonna do is loop through all of these dictionaries for us now the way that works is because we're looking at this list because we're saying data in tense then we're saying for every single intent in here which will give us all of these dictionaries which would be really easy and nice to loop through all these different patterns and all of that so now what we're gonna do we're gonna say for in this case pattern in intent and now remember this is a dictionary so we access the patterns registered patterns we're gonna do something specific with these patterns and this is known as stemming now this is the first part where we actually start understanding some of this kind of machine learning AI stuff for our chat BOTS now what stemming does is it's gonna take each word that's in our pattern so let's look at the words here and bring it down to the root word which means that for example is anyone there well if we're looking at the word there we're gonna say they're the root word of their question mark is just there so we're gonna remove this question mark if we have something like what's up we're gonna change this to just be what instead of what's right cuz we're gonna get the root of the word now the reason we you get the root of the word is because when we're training our model and our training our bot we don't really care about the other things attached to the word we just care about the main meaning of the word so by eliminating extra characters and things that might make the word different it's making our model that much more accurate because we're gonna ignore things that could stray the model in the wrong direction you guys understand more about how this works in future tutorials now to get all the different words in our patterns and to stem them we need to do something called tokenize now what tokenized means is just get all the words in our pattern it's the same thing as just splitting it by a space and getting all these different words but NL TK has a nice thing that does it for us and we're gonna use that and we're gonna say words or I will do like W RDS equals in this case n LT k dot word underscore tokenizer I think it is let's say oh just tokenized and then we're gonna put padding now this is gonna return to us a list with all of the different words in it and now what we're gonna do is we're simply gonna put all of these tokenized words into our words list now the reason we do this is because we want to know all of the different words that are in our intense file and we'll talk about that a bit later but that's what we're gonna do so just go say words dot extend and in this case W RDS now the reason we do this is because this is already a list so rather than looping through it and appending each one in we can just extend the list which means we're going to add all of those words in so now that we've done that the next thing that we need to do is we're gonna add to our Docs the pattern of words now what we're going to do to do this we're gonna say Docs dot append and in this case we're just going to append the pattern like that and that's all we need to do for that now finally we're gonna say if intent in this case tag which or yeah intent tag which will give us like these goodbye greetings age name in let's say labels or not in labels we'll need to do my back say not in labels then we're going to say the labels dot append and in this case intent now this way we're just gonna get all of the different tags that we have so greeting goodbye age name I guess we don't really need to do it like this per se we can just say if intent tag not in labels labels not append intent I don't know why I had that in the for loop in my other thing this should just work fine though to do that for us okay sweet so that's actually all we need to do right now for loading in all of our words and our labels and getting our documents ready with all the different patterns so I'm gonna leave the tutorial here in the next video what we're gonna do is do a little bit more on this data preprocessing and then we'll start working on creating our model and our training data and how all that's gonna work for our chatbot so if you guys enjoyed please make sure you leave a like and subscribe to the channel and I will see you again in the next video
