00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna be sharing with you my programming
00:15 - slash developer goals for 2022 now in
00:18 - 2021 a lot of what i ended up doing was
00:20 - just working with technologies languages
00:22 - and frameworks that i already knew
00:24 - pretty well so i was getting some
00:26 - practice in but i wasn't really learning
00:28 - anything completely from scratch or
00:29 - something completely new that i haven't
00:31 - looked into before so for this year i
00:33 - really want to focus on learning some
00:35 - new technologies new frameworks new
00:37 - languages and being an absolute beginner
00:39 - at something once again because from my
00:41 - experience that's very fun that's super
00:43 - motivating and although it's great to
00:45 - kind of master what you already know
00:47 - sometimes it's nice to go right back to
00:48 - the beginning and kind of learn
00:50 - something completely from scratch so
00:51 - that's what this video is really going
00:52 - to be talking about all the new things
00:54 - that i really want to dive into in 2022.
00:57 - now before we go any further i want to
00:58 - give you guys an opportunity to share
01:00 - your goals with me so go leave a comment
01:03 - and tell me one goal that you have for
01:05 - 2022 as it relates to programming and
01:08 - software development and if you're
01:09 - someone who doesn't have any goals yet
01:10 - then maybe go and check out the comments
01:12 - and see if you can find any inspiration
01:14 - or technologies languages frameworks
01:16 - whatever it may be that you want to
01:18 - learn in this year i will also mention
01:21 - that one place that may be able to help
01:22 - you work on your goals for 2022 is the
01:25 - sponsor of this video which is career
01:27 - karma career karma is an awesome
01:29 - platform that helps connect developers
01:31 - like you to great boot camps and courses
01:33 - that jumpstart your career in tech i've
01:36 - worked with career karma for a long time
01:38 - now and share their mission of inspiring
01:40 - motivating and helping people get into
01:42 - the tech field career karma has content
01:45 - related to ui and ux data science web
01:49 - development and pretty much anything
01:51 - that you can think of and it helps you
01:52 - get into great boot camps to master
01:55 - these skills now one of my favorite
01:57 - parts about career karma is their
01:58 - emphasis on community and their great

02:08 - fact a few weeks ago i actually hosted a
02:10 - live audio room on the mobile app there
02:13 - was a hundred people that actually
02:14 - joined in got to talk to me and i shared
02:16 - some tips and advice on how you can get
02:18 - into the tech field and all kinds of
02:20 - other people that are experienced like
02:22 - myself are on that app hosting live
02:24 - audio rooms almost every single day now

02:38 - session from career karma thanks again
02:41 - to career karma for sponsoring this
02:42 - video now let's get into it so in this
02:45 - video i'm going to share with you five
02:47 - goals that i have for 2022. these are
02:49 - all related to programming i have some
02:51 - in my personal life but maybe we'll
02:52 - leave those for another video but the
02:54 - first goal that i have here is to master
02:57 - css now css is something that i have
03:00 - always hated doing something that i
03:02 - really never spent the time to learn
03:04 - that i only ever use when i need to use
03:06 - it so i'll always try to use some
03:08 - framework that can do the css for me
03:10 - i'll copy and paste stuff from the
03:11 - internet and i almost never have any
03:13 - idea what any of the css for my websites
03:16 - or small projects that i'm working on is
03:18 - actually do it so i've already started
03:20 - actually during the christmas break
03:22 - trying to really learn the fundamentals
03:24 - of css even the complete basic stuff
03:26 - that i've just brushed over in the past
03:28 - and try to get better at it because it's
03:30 - not something that seems super
03:31 - complicated but it's just something that
03:33 - i've been putting off and something that
03:34 - i think that i should probably know
03:36 - after programming for almost about 10
03:38 - years so that is the first goal to
03:40 - really get good at css i hope that in a
03:42 - few months i'm able to do some advanced
03:44 - css animations i can style websites
03:47 - quite easily and it's no longer this
03:49 - kind of huge thing that i've been
03:50 - ignoring for a long time and i actually
03:52 - understand what's going on when i read
03:54 - basic css now the second goal that i
03:56 - have for 2022 kind of goes along with
03:58 - goal number one and this is really to
04:00 - get way better at front-end development
04:02 - so myself i really focus on kind of the
04:04 - back end languages java c plus python
04:08 - python is kind of the main language i
04:09 - use on this channel but i have used
04:11 - javascript before and typescript and
04:14 - when i used those languages i really
04:15 - enjoyed them but i never was really
04:17 - working in a front-end environment
04:19 - everything that i really do and that i'm
04:21 - good at is related to back and
04:22 - development maybe making games maybe
04:24 - making the back end of a website or
04:27 - making websites without really using any
04:28 - kind of advanced front-end techniques so
04:31 - this year i really want to focus on
04:32 - getting better on front-end development
04:34 - and kind of rounding myself out a bit
04:35 - because i have the back-end skills and
04:37 - now it's time to add the front-end
04:39 - skills and really be able to create some
04:40 - cool projects for me what limits me a
04:43 - lot when i'm working on something is
04:44 - that i can do all of the functionality
04:46 - all of the logic that's completely fine
04:48 - but when it comes to a nice kind of
04:49 - stylish front end or a nice functional
04:51 - front end for that matter somebody has a
04:53 - good user experience that's just
04:55 - something i'm lacking and something that
04:56 - i want to get better at this year so
04:58 - that's what i'm going to be focusing on
04:59 - i'll probably get into a few front-end
05:01 - frameworks i have worked with react in
05:03 - the past so i'll probably look at that a
05:04 - little bit more that's going to really
05:06 - complement well with the css skills i'll
05:08 - hopefully be building up and yeah
05:09 - hopefully by the end of the year you
05:11 - guys will actually be seeing some kind
05:12 - of more advanced front-end development
05:14 - tutorials on this channel so now my
05:16 - third goal for 2022 and this is to get
05:19 - better working with go slash go link now
05:22 - go is a programming language that i
05:23 - absolutely love writing in i learned it
05:26 - probably about two and a half years ago
05:27 - in a computer science course that i was
05:29 - taking at school we needed to use it to
05:31 - work on some different projects i really
05:33 - enjoyed working with it i got pretty
05:35 - good with it fairly quickly but since
05:37 - then i haven't really used it very much
05:39 - and i always keep thinking to myself oh
05:41 - i wish i could learn more about go oh i
05:42 - want to write this in go but i always
05:44 - kind of just default to python which is
05:46 - the language that i know best so this
05:48 - year i really want to make a conscious
05:49 - effort to try to write more stuff in go
05:52 - because a lot of the programs i write
05:53 - can be replicated in go and can actually
05:55 - be much more performant because go is
05:57 - kind of a high performance server side
06:00 - language it works for back end web
06:01 - development apis stuff like that so i
06:03 - want to learn more about go hopefully
06:05 - post some videos on this channel and i'm
06:07 - also considering adding this to the
06:09 - programming expert course that i have so
06:11 - if you guys don't know i have a course
06:13 - programming expert dot io is the link
06:15 - for it you can use discount code tim if
06:17 - you would like anyways it prepares you
06:19 - to become a software engineer and
06:20 - teaches you all the necessary coding
06:22 - skills but right now we just have python
06:24 - on there so i'm considering adding go as
06:26 - a second language and teaching kind of a
06:28 - statically typed language on there as
06:30 - well anyways that was a bit of a side
06:32 - track another goal to go along with that
06:34 - is to actually improve programming
06:35 - expert.io throughout the rest of the
06:37 - year and well to do that i'm going to
06:38 - have to learn more about go if you want
06:40 - to add it to that course all right so
06:42 - now we're moving on to goal number four
06:44 - which is to create an interesting
06:46 - decentralized application
06:48 - using the blockchain now i know a lot of
06:50 - you have realized that recently i've
06:52 - been posting a lot about cryptocurrency
06:54 - blockchain solidity developing on the
06:56 - blockchain nfts all of that type of
06:59 - stuff now i just want to start by saying
07:01 - i'm not trying to sell you anything this
07:02 - is going to be completely free whatever
07:04 - i end up doing no crypto scams here
07:06 - don't worry i'm not chilling any coins
07:08 - or anything like that i see a lot of
07:09 - people commenting saying that they're
07:11 - disappointed in me for talking about the
07:12 - blockchain when in reality all i'm doing
07:15 - is actually showing you how to develop
07:16 - on the blockchain completely for free
07:19 - i'm not trying to sell you anything i'm
07:20 - not promoting any coins or anything
07:22 - along those lines regardless what i want
07:24 - to do in 2022 is work on this idea that
07:27 - i had i'm gonna run it by you guys here
07:29 - please let me know if you think this is
07:30 - a cool idea in the comments so my idea
07:33 - was essentially to make it so in every
07:35 - single one of my videos there'd be some
07:37 - type of code that pops up pretty obvious
07:39 - probably in the intro something like
07:41 - tim1234 something along those lines and
07:44 - if you found this code in the video you
07:46 - could take it to a smart contract and
07:48 - redeem it for a free nft that shows that
07:51 - you watched my video so essentially a
07:53 - receipt saying hey you watched this tech
07:55 - with tim video now these nfts you could
07:58 - cash them in for coins these coins would
08:01 - be again completely free you just cash
08:02 - them in by watching my videos
08:04 - essentially and then you could use these
08:06 - coins to actually bid on or to enter
08:08 - like raffles or auctions where you could
08:10 - win prizes that i would provide to the
08:12 - community so the idea would be to
08:14 - encourage people to watch my videos if
08:16 - you watch them you can kind of find this
08:18 - code uh use it to redeem an nft you can
08:21 - then cash that nft in for some coins
08:23 - then use the coins in whatever way i'm
08:25 - going to determine it would be all kind
08:26 - of community related stuff giveaways
08:28 - maybe roles in my discord server
08:30 - whatever that was kind of the general
08:32 - concept now this would be a relatively
08:34 - complicated project because i need to
08:36 - come up with some way to actually give
08:37 - you nfts then a way to kind of cash
08:40 - those in for coins people that watch the
08:42 - video sooner would get more coins from
08:44 - their nft i would do stuff like that and
08:46 - then i'd have to figure out a website to
08:48 - interact with to claim the different
08:50 - prizes or whatever the roles are and
08:52 - stuff that i'm gonna give from the coins
08:54 - this is a very abstract concept but
08:55 - something that i want to try working on
08:57 - in 2022 let me know what you guys think
08:59 - of it if you think it's a good idea i'll
09:00 - definitely start working on it and i'll
09:02 - probably end up streaming actually me
09:04 - creating this whole thing because of
09:05 - course it's going to be open source and
09:07 - again this is all going to be free
09:09 - anyways that is that goal so get better
09:11 - with cryptocurrency blockchain
09:13 - technology and hopefully create
09:14 - something that you guys can interact
09:16 - with and use all right so now we are
09:18 - moving on to goal number five now this
09:20 - is not directly related to programming
09:22 - or software development but it is
09:24 - somewhat and that is to reach 1 million
09:26 - subscribers on youtube so at the time of
09:29 - filming this video i'm at about 870 000
09:32 - subscribers so it's a very achievable
09:34 - goal for me to try to get 1 million
09:36 - subscribers this year however this has
09:38 - been something i've been working towards
09:40 - for a very long time and the way i've
09:42 - been able to get subscribers is by
09:44 - learning more about programming and then
09:45 - sharing that knowledge with you guys so
09:47 - that kind of wraps up the end of the
09:49 - video here all of these four goals me
09:51 - learning all of these topics is really
09:53 - so that i can post a lot of the stuff
09:55 - that i learn and teach you guys what
09:57 - i've learned on this channel and
09:58 - hopefully reach that big milestone of 1
10:01 - million subscribers this year in 2022
10:04 - speaking of which if you are not
10:05 - subscribed please start helping me out
10:07 - to reach this goal by hitting the
10:08 - subscribe button down below leave a
10:10 - comment let me know your goals for 2022
10:13 - and if you think that kind of blockchain
10:14 - idea is interesting and i should do that
10:17 - and with that said i'm going to wrap up
10:19 - the video here i hope you guys enjoyed
10:21 - those are my goals please hold me to
10:23 - them and i will see you in another
10:25 - youtube video
10:26 - [Music]
10:34 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna be sharing with you my programming slash developer goals for 2022 now in 2021 a lot of what i ended up doing was just working with technologies languages and frameworks that i already knew pretty well so i was getting some practice in but i wasn't really learning anything completely from scratch or something completely new that i haven't looked into before so for this year i really want to focus on learning some new technologies new frameworks new languages and being an absolute beginner at something once again because from my experience that's very fun that's super motivating and although it's great to kind of master what you already know sometimes it's nice to go right back to the beginning and kind of learn something completely from scratch so that's what this video is really going to be talking about all the new things that i really want to dive into in 2022. now before we go any further i want to give you guys an opportunity to share your goals with me so go leave a comment and tell me one goal that you have for 2022 as it relates to programming and software development and if you're someone who doesn't have any goals yet then maybe go and check out the comments and see if you can find any inspiration or technologies languages frameworks whatever it may be that you want to learn in this year i will also mention that one place that may be able to help you work on your goals for 2022 is the sponsor of this video which is career karma career karma is an awesome platform that helps connect developers like you to great boot camps and courses that jumpstart your career in tech i've worked with career karma for a long time now and share their mission of inspiring motivating and helping people get into the tech field career karma has content related to ui and ux data science web development and pretty much anything that you can think of and it helps you get into great boot camps to master these skills now one of my favorite parts about career karma is their emphasis on community and their great free mobile app on the app you can post you can comment you can read articles and you can join live audio rooms in fact a few weeks ago i actually hosted a live audio room on the mobile app there was a hundred people that actually joined in got to talk to me and i shared some tips and advice on how you can get into the tech field and all kinds of other people that are experienced like myself are on that app hosting live audio rooms almost every single day now if you want to get started with career karma then you should click the link in the description or download the mobile app because the first 1 000 of my subscribers to sign up are going to be eligible for a free career coaching session from career karma thanks again to career karma for sponsoring this video now let's get into it so in this video i'm going to share with you five goals that i have for 2022. these are all related to programming i have some in my personal life but maybe we'll leave those for another video but the first goal that i have here is to master css now css is something that i have always hated doing something that i really never spent the time to learn that i only ever use when i need to use it so i'll always try to use some framework that can do the css for me i'll copy and paste stuff from the internet and i almost never have any idea what any of the css for my websites or small projects that i'm working on is actually do it so i've already started actually during the christmas break trying to really learn the fundamentals of css even the complete basic stuff that i've just brushed over in the past and try to get better at it because it's not something that seems super complicated but it's just something that i've been putting off and something that i think that i should probably know after programming for almost about 10 years so that is the first goal to really get good at css i hope that in a few months i'm able to do some advanced css animations i can style websites quite easily and it's no longer this kind of huge thing that i've been ignoring for a long time and i actually understand what's going on when i read basic css now the second goal that i have for 2022 kind of goes along with goal number one and this is really to get way better at frontend development so myself i really focus on kind of the back end languages java c plus python python is kind of the main language i use on this channel but i have used javascript before and typescript and when i used those languages i really enjoyed them but i never was really working in a frontend environment everything that i really do and that i'm good at is related to back and development maybe making games maybe making the back end of a website or making websites without really using any kind of advanced frontend techniques so this year i really want to focus on getting better on frontend development and kind of rounding myself out a bit because i have the backend skills and now it's time to add the frontend skills and really be able to create some cool projects for me what limits me a lot when i'm working on something is that i can do all of the functionality all of the logic that's completely fine but when it comes to a nice kind of stylish front end or a nice functional front end for that matter somebody has a good user experience that's just something i'm lacking and something that i want to get better at this year so that's what i'm going to be focusing on i'll probably get into a few frontend frameworks i have worked with react in the past so i'll probably look at that a little bit more that's going to really complement well with the css skills i'll hopefully be building up and yeah hopefully by the end of the year you guys will actually be seeing some kind of more advanced frontend development tutorials on this channel so now my third goal for 2022 and this is to get better working with go slash go link now go is a programming language that i absolutely love writing in i learned it probably about two and a half years ago in a computer

scams here don't worry i'm not chilling any coins or anything like that i see a lot of people commenting saying that they're disappointed in me for talking about the blockchain when in reality all i'm doing is actually showing you how to develop on the blockchain completely for free i'm not trying to sell you anything i'm not promoting any coins or anything along those lines regardless what i want to do in 2022 is work on this idea that i had i'm gonna run it by you guys here please let me know if you think this is a cool idea in the comments so my idea was essentially to make it so in every single one of my videos there'd be some type of code that pops up pretty obvious probably in the intro something like tim1234 something along those lines and if you found this code in the video you could take it to a smart contract and redeem it for a free nft that shows that you watched my video so essentially a receipt saying hey you watched this tech with tim video now these nfts you could cash them in for coins these coins would be again completely free you just cash them in by watching my videos essentially and then you could use these coins to actually bid on or to enter like raffles or auctions where you could win prizes that i would provide to the community so the idea would be to encourage people to watch my videos if you watch them you can kind of find this code uh use it to redeem an nft you can then cash that nft in for some coins then use the coins in whatever way i'm going to determine it would be all kind of community related stuff giveaways maybe roles in my discord server whatever that was kind of the general concept now this would be a relatively complicated project because i need to come up with some way to actually give you nfts then a way to kind of cash those in for coins people that watch the video sooner would get more coins from their nft i would do stuff like that and then i'd have to figure out a website to interact with to claim the different prizes or whatever the roles are and stuff that i'm gonna give from the coins this is a very abstract concept but something that i want to try working on in 2022 let me know what you guys think of it if you think it's a good idea i'll definitely start working on it and i'll probably end up streaming actually me creating this whole thing because of course it's going to be open source and again this is all going to be free anyways that is that goal so get better with cryptocurrency blockchain technology and hopefully create something that you guys can interact with and use all right so now we are

these four goals me learning all of these topics is really so that i can post a lot of the stuff that i learn and teach you guys what i've learned on this channel and hopefully reach that big milestone of 1 million subscribers this year in 2022 speaking of which if you are not subscribed please start helping me out to reach this goal by hitting the subscribe button down below leave a comment let me know your goals for 2022 and if you think that kind of blockchain idea is interesting and i should do that and with that said i'm going to wrap up the video here i hope you guys enjoyed those are my goals please hold me to them and i will see you in another youtube video you
