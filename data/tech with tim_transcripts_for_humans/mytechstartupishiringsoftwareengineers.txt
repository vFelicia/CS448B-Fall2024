00:20 - of funding we're ready to hire people
00:22 - today and if you'd like to apply you can
00:24 - check out the link in the description
00:26 - now specifically we're looking for
00:28 - people that have experience with html5
00:30 - and javascript game development if you
00:32 - know how to build games in the browser
00:34 - we want to hire you we will hire you as
00:36 - soon as we possibly can we will pay you
00:38 - well we'll make sure you can work
00:40 - whenever you want at any point in time
00:42 - completely remotely you will work
00:43 - alongside me as well as a few other guys
00:46 - that are kind of the business heads of
00:48 - the business i'm just the engineer here
00:50 - and this is a great opportunity from a
00:52 - very very fast growing company that has
00:54 - a ton of potential now i'm going to talk
00:56 - to you about the company what the idea
00:58 - is and all of that stuff but i just want
01:00 - to reiterate again if you're a game
01:02 - developer you're looking for some type
01:03 - of work part-time or full-time please
01:05 - consider applying have a look in the
01:07 - description all right so what is this
01:09 - company as i said it is called velocity
01:12 - now what we're doing here is providing
01:14 - cognitive training for amateur athletes
01:16 - so this can be in many different formats
01:18 - but for now we're going to be building
01:19 - out a mobile application and this mobile
01:22 - app will have a ton of different games
01:24 - that train different cognitive functions
01:26 - so decision making anticipation spatial
01:28 - awareness etc those are a few examples
01:31 - of things that we would be training now
01:33 - this is going to be very specific for
01:34 - athletes this is not just these kind of
01:36 - general purpose brain training apps that
01:38 - you see we're really targeting the
01:40 - athletics market and the idea here is
01:42 - that good athletes train their bodies
01:44 - but great athletes train their minds
01:46 - it's kind of like weightlifting for your
01:48 - mind right all the pro athletes those
01:50 - guys go to million dollar simulators and
01:52 - facilities and they do cognitive
01:54 - training but if you're kind of an
01:56 - amateur athlete you play in house league
01:57 - or you play in rep or you're just not
01:59 - kind of at that level yet you don't have
02:01 - access to that training and we want to
02:03 - provide that that's really the goal of
02:05 - this company now of course there's a ton
02:07 - of other things that i could describe
02:08 - i'm not here to give you a sales pitch
02:10 - this is if you want a job if you want to
02:12 - invest that's a completely different
02:13 - story anyways that is kind of what the
02:15 - company is about so again going back to
02:18 - the role here we need people to build
02:20 - these games i am the engineer i am the
02:22 - one who's building the entire app and
02:24 - then within the app we're going to have
02:26 - a web view and that web view will
02:27 - actually run the different html5 games
02:30 - that will train cognitive functions now
02:32 - we can provide you with kind of
02:34 - templates of the games that we need to
02:35 - be built but we're looking for people
02:37 - that have experience with graphics with
02:39 - sound with animations that can build the
02:41 - game out add their own creative touches
02:43 - and spins and ideally do this at a
02:46 - relatively fast pace if you're someone
02:48 - who thinks you can do this there's a ton
02:50 - of opportunity at this company again it
02:52 - is very early stage right now we're
02:54 - about four employees but we are growing
02:56 - very quickly and we have a really strong
02:58 - team behind us again i want to be really
03:00 - careful how much i share here on youtube
03:03 - all i'll say is if you're interested
03:04 - please leave an application down below
03:07 - in the description i have a little form
03:08 - there that you can fill out provide some
03:10 - information about yourself and if i
03:12 - think you are a good fit i'm going to
03:13 - read through all the applications myself
03:15 - i will reach out to you we'll have a
03:17 - very short kind of informal interview
03:19 - and then we're ready to get started as
03:20 - soon as you are ready so the last thing
03:22 - i'll say here is that i am obviously
03:24 - highly invested in this company a lot of
03:26 - my time is going towards this i am a
03:28 - shareholder of this company i've
03:30 - invested my own money as well and the
03:32 - reason i'm doing that is because i
03:34 - really do see a potential here i think
03:36 - this is something that could be very
03:37 - massive and quite frankly make a lot of
03:40 - money if we execute this properly and
03:42 - i'm just sharing that with you because i
03:43 - could easily sit back continue filming
03:45 - youtube videos and spend the next few
03:47 - years just making hundreds of thousands
03:49 - of dollars per year with these videos
03:51 - instead what i'm doing is diverting my
03:53 - time taking a bit of a risk and really
03:56 - committing to this idea so i just want
03:57 - you to know i'm very invested in this if
03:59 - you decide to join this you'll be
04:01 - working alongside me there's a lot of
04:03 - potential to join as a full-time
04:04 - employee potentially get some stock
04:07 - we're very open-minded and we're really
04:08 - just looking to build the best team and
04:10 - get the best people if you think you can
04:13 - commit some time to this if you're
04:14 - willing to give it a shot please give a
04:16 - application in the description again i'm
04:19 - going to review all of them myself and
04:20 - reach out to anyone i think might be a
04:22 - fit hopefully you guys enjoyed this if
04:24 - you want some more updates on the
04:25 - startup let me know in the comments down
04:27 - below and i will see you in another
04:29 - youtube video
