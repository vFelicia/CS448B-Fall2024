00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the third video
00:02 - in my Python turtle tutorial series you
00:06 - guys might notice it looks a bit
00:08 - different and this is being recorded
00:09 - like four months later that's because I
00:11 - honestly completely forgot about the
00:13 - series and only recently has it started
00:15 - getting a few more views so I decided I
00:17 - would continue it because a lot of you
00:19 - guys have been asking for that anyways
00:20 - I'm gonna be working in PyCharm today
00:22 - it's that's the editor that I'm using
00:24 - anything I do in here is will work more
00:26 - than fine and ideally there's nothing
00:29 - like fancy I'm gonna do in here that you
00:31 - can't do in Idol or any other editor so
00:32 - don't worry about that okay so in this
00:34 - tutorial like I mentioned before we're
00:36 - gonna be going over events and how you
00:37 - can draw things using like user input so
00:40 - not just drawing like a static shape
00:42 - every time you're on the program like
00:43 - the user gets to pick by hitting certain
00:45 - keys or hitting the mouse what they want
00:47 - to draw on the screen which is
00:48 - essentially what we wanted to get into
00:50 - right so first I'm going to import
00:51 - turtle I'm going to import random and I
00:56 - don't know if I have to do this but I'm
00:57 - just going to do it in case from turtle
00:59 - import star it just means import
01:02 - everything alright
01:03 - I'm gonna set up a turtle object we've
01:05 - already done this before say Tim equals
01:08 - well I can't type turtle thought turtle
01:11 - like that I'm just gonna give him a
01:13 - speed of 0 which is maximum speed so
01:17 - that when we hit a key it instantly
01:18 - moves we don't have to wait we don't get
01:20 - any delay I'm gonna give a width of 5
01:24 - like that okay now I'm just gonna set up
01:28 - these colors I'm actually just gonna
01:29 - copy in a list the same one that I had
01:31 - in the last tutorial
01:32 - just because we're gonna do something
01:33 - with the colors as well and I don't
01:35 - really need to waste time typing those
01:36 - out ok so we've got some colors and now
01:39 - what the whole goal of this program is
01:41 - going to be used to allow the user to
01:42 - hit keys and based on what they hit the
01:45 - keys they're gonna move like left/right
01:47 - up/down and so on so what we need to do
01:50 - actually to do this we have to set up a
01:52 - few functions and these functions are
01:53 - gonna represent what happens when you
01:56 - hit the certain key so we need a
01:57 - function code up okay we need a function
02:00 - called down and then obviously left and
02:03 - right as well okay okay so we've got
02:06 - these functions now let's figure out
02:09 - what we're gonna actually do in here so
02:11 - in the up function here what I
02:13 - do is I want to set the heading of the
02:15 - turtle and I'll talk about what this
02:16 - does in a second because I can't
02:18 - remember if I talked to an earlier video
02:19 - 290 which means north which is upwards
02:23 - and then we're gonna go forward 100 so
02:28 - what this is gonna do essentially is
02:30 - it's gonna point our turtle upwards and
02:31 - then it's gonna go 100 so no matter what
02:33 - direction it was most recently in we go
02:35 - up and then we go hundred and these are
02:37 - similar for down left and right so
02:39 - except for down the heading is gonna be
02:41 - 270 because it's directly opposite of up
02:44 - and this is just like basic compass
02:45 - headings okay and then for left we're
02:50 - going to need a heading of 180 and
02:53 - forward again of 100 and then for right
02:56 - we need to change the heading simply to
02:57 - zero okay and though that's pretty much
03:01 - how we're gonna move the turtle this is
03:02 - really straight forward so now I'll go
03:04 - into the events that we're gonna need to
03:07 - use so in turtle there's these things
03:09 - called events and events is pretty much
03:10 - anything that the user does so any input
03:12 - from them so you moving your mouse
03:13 - around as an event hitting a key on like
03:16 - anything that you can do on the computer
03:18 - so like a keyboard and mouse is an event
03:20 - and it's gonna pick up on those events
03:22 - some things we just have to determine
03:23 - which events we want to listen to and
03:26 - react to so the first event or the first
03:29 - thing we need to do when we're gonna be
03:30 - listening for events is we have to type
03:32 - turtle dot listen and this is just gonna
03:34 - let the program know that we're now
03:36 - listening for events and we're able to
03:38 - do what I'm about to do now so there's
03:40 - these things called
03:42 - on key alright and this is what's gonna
03:45 - determine what key was hit so I'm just
03:47 - gonna type it out and I'll kind of talk
03:49 - about it as we go through so turtle dot
03:50 - on key okay and in here I'm gonna put up
03:54 - as the function and I'm gonna push
03:56 - string up like this okay so the way that
03:59 - this works is now that we're listening
04:01 - for events we're gonna see okay so if
04:03 - turtle on key we're gonna activate this
04:07 - function based on this key so pretty
04:09 - much what this is doing essentially is
04:11 - looking for the up key if it's been hit
04:13 - then we're gonna do whatever is in this
04:15 - up function and notice I don't need the
04:18 - brackets like that it's just gonna
04:20 - automatically call the up function so we
04:23 - don't need to do anything so I'm gonna
04:24 - copy this
04:26 - and I'm gonna put it four times so up
04:28 - and that we need down left and obviously
04:34 - right and then we're gonna have to
04:35 - change the function names as well okay
04:37 - right and down left and finally right
04:45 - okay so again what these are doing
04:48 - simply listening to see if this key is
04:50 - hit so keep up and up in this string
04:52 - represents your arrow key the up arrow
04:55 - key down left right same thing and then
04:57 - we're just gonna call these functions
04:58 - and do what we've done in here really
04:59 - straightforward that was only one more
05:00 - thing we need
05:01 - and it's this main loop thing okay so
05:05 - what this main loop does is simply is
05:08 - gonna keep continuing to look for all of
05:12 - these key presses until the program is
05:14 - closed by us meaning we hit the X button
05:16 - if we don't have this main loop what
05:18 - happens is the program is just gonna
05:20 - instantly close because well we're not
05:21 - drawing anything and it looks for events
05:25 - and if no event is hit like the second
05:27 - we open the program then it's just gonna
05:28 - close so we need to add this main loop
05:30 - and whatever you're putting main loop
05:31 - make sure you put it at the very bottom
05:33 - of your program okay and it can't be
05:35 - inside like actually I think it can be
05:36 - inside a function but for now we're
05:38 - gonna leave it in the main okay I'm
05:40 - gonna run the program and you can see
05:42 - now that we popped up with little turtle
05:43 - graphics and if I hit the left arrow key
05:45 - I'm left if I go up I go up left down
05:48 - and you can see that we can kind of draw
05:49 - around the screen and that's pretty cool
05:52 - that we were able to do that in like a
05:54 - few minutes by just hitting a few arrow
05:55 - keys okay and you guys can mess around
05:57 - with this change the color or whatever
05:59 - so now what I'm gonna show you is what
06:01 - happens when you click the mouse one so
06:03 - this is pretty boring I want to add some
06:05 - colors to my turtle like screen or
06:09 - whatever okay so the way I'm gonna do
06:10 - that is I'm gonna say if the user hits
06:12 - the left mouse button I want to change
06:14 - the color of the turtle to be a random
06:16 - color if they hit the left mouse button
06:18 - or the right mouse button sorry then I
06:20 - want something different to happen I
06:22 - want to like stamp the turtle and I
06:24 - think I talked to it stamp in the other
06:25 - videos okay so what I'm gonna do now
06:27 - here I'm gonna step another function cuz
06:29 - we're gonna have to check to see if the
06:30 - user hit the left or right mouse button
06:33 - so we need functions for them so what's
06:35 - gonna happen when you click them so I'm
06:36 - gonna say this one is click left okay
06:39 - and we actually need to type in two
06:41 - parameters in here and I'll talk about
06:43 - why we need to do that in just one
06:44 - second
06:44 - okay so if they click left what I want
06:46 - to do is I want to what do you call it
06:49 - change the color right okay so to do
06:53 - this we've done this before Tim color
06:56 - and is equal to random dot choice colors
07:01 - so I noticed someone commented in my
07:03 - other video this is a lot easier way to
07:04 - select a random item out of a list so
07:07 - all this does is just randomly pick an
07:08 - item out of our list and gives it in the
07:10 - color 4 so I'm just gonna do that and
07:12 - save us a bit of time okay so I'm just
07:13 - gonna copy this and make one called
07:17 - click right okay it does need this X&Y
07:20 - again so make sure that's in there
07:22 - that's important and when we click write
07:24 - what I want to do is I want to stamp D
07:27 - turtle down on the screen okay so now
07:30 - these ones are a bit different for mouse
07:32 - buttons alright when you're clicking
07:34 - Mouse buttons so there's two different
07:35 - types of clicks that you could actually
07:36 - do you can do a click on the actual
07:39 - turtle or you can do a click on the
07:41 - turtle screen now in our case I want to
07:43 - do it on the screen so they can click
07:45 - anywhere on on the actual title screen
07:47 - to change the color but if you wanted to
07:49 - do just on the turtle what you would do
07:51 - is I'll just type it out in case I don't
07:53 - you guys want to do this turtle duck
07:55 - sorry on click like this okay and then
07:59 - it's gonna be the same thing as here so
08:02 - what you do is say you wanted to say if
08:03 - you actually click the turtle object
08:05 - then you'd say click left and then you
08:08 - can either type 1 2 or 3 here now 1
08:11 - stands for your left mouse button 2
08:13 - stands for your middle mouse button and
08:14 - 3 stands for your right mouse button
08:16 - okay so if you wanted it to be a left
08:19 - mouse button you would obviously want to
08:20 - put 1 now the thing is we don't want to
08:22 - have it when they click on the turtle
08:23 - object we want to have it when they
08:24 - click anywhere on the screen so the way
08:26 - that we do this is just type on screen
08:27 - and click so it's pretty intuitive and
08:29 - same thing we're gonna click left when
08:31 - they're clicking the left mouse button
08:32 - now I'm gonna copy this paste it down
08:35 - here and simply change this to 3 and
08:38 - then change this to click right because
08:41 - like I mentioned 3 stands for right
08:42 - mouse button click right is what's
08:44 - happening let me click the right mouse
08:45 - button and let's test this out and make
08:48 - sure everything's working ok so I'm
08:50 - gonna start moving and if I click
08:52 - mouse button so my leftmost button you
08:54 - can see that we change colors and I can
08:56 - continue to click it as much as I want
08:57 - and we just keep randomly changing
08:59 - colors now what happens if I click my
09:01 - right mouse button you can see that
09:03 - actually stamped down that little arrow
09:04 - on wherever we're drawing like this okay
09:08 - and you guys can do whatever you want
09:10 - with your event so now that you know
09:11 - about events and you already know about
09:13 - a bunch of different turtle methods and
09:14 - stuff like that you could change this to
09:17 - be for example if you wanted to be the a
09:19 - key you would change it to a if you want
09:21 - to be spacebar I think you'd have to
09:23 - look it up for space folks I don't know
09:25 - it is but if you want to be like the six
09:26 - key you just put six and it's pretty
09:28 - intuitive in terms of the actual names
09:31 - that go in this string anyways I hope
09:34 - you guys learned a little bit that has
09:36 - been it for this tutorial on the turtle
09:39 - graphics I'm gonna do another tutorial
09:41 - where I talk about more stuff in terms
09:43 - of drawing with the actual mouse so you
09:45 - can move your mouse around and draw like
09:47 - different shapes and objects and yeah
09:49 - that'll be in the next video so make
09:51 - sure you guys leave a like and subscribe
09:52 - and I'll see you again in the next one
09:54 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome to the third video in my Python turtle tutorial series you guys might notice it looks a bit different and this is being recorded like four months later that's because I honestly completely forgot about the series and only recently has it started getting a few more views so I decided I would continue it because a lot of you guys have been asking for that anyways I'm gonna be working in PyCharm today it's that's the editor that I'm using anything I do in here is will work more than fine and ideally there's nothing like fancy I'm gonna do in here that you can't do in Idol

everything alright I'm gonna set up a turtle object we've already done this before say Tim equals well I can't type turtle thought turtle like that I'm just gonna give him a speed of 0 which is maximum speed so that when we hit a key it instantly moves we don't have to wait we don't get any delay I'm gonna give a width of 5 like that okay now I'm just gonna set up these colors I'm actually just gonna copy in a list the same one that I had in the last tutorial just because we're gonna do something with the colors as well and I don't really need to waste time typing those out ok so we've
