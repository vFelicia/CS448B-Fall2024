01:39 - who's going to win those and how that
01:41 - works in a minute for now though let me
01:43 - dive into kind of the theme and just a
01:45 - bit of context and then we'll get into
01:46 - all of the projects and if i'm boring
01:48 - you then you can skip forward there
01:49 - should be some time stamps when i
01:51 - actually start kind of demoing the top
01:52 - five projects all right so i'm just on
01:54 - the code jam information page here i'm
01:56 - going to give you a little bit of
01:57 - context first thing to note if you want
01:59 - to read any of this yourself you can go
02:01 - to the website twtcodejam.net
02:03 - i also want to give a massive thank you
02:05 - to everyone who participated here as
02:07 - well as my discord staff team for
02:09 - organizing this doing all of the grading
02:11 - which i'm going to talk about in a
02:12 - second and generally just spending a
02:14 - bunch of time helping out the community
02:15 - really appreciate it guys i also want to
02:17 - note if you did not get in the top 5 or
02:19 - the top 15 or anything like that please
02:21 - don't be discouraged please submit again
02:23 - i've seen many of you guys submit over
02:25 - multiple code gems and you just keep
02:26 - getting better and better and that's
02:28 - really the point of this yes the prizes
02:30 - are nice but i want to give you guys an
02:31 - opportunity to practice and create some
02:33 - cool coding projects regardless though
02:35 - the theme for this code jam was make
02:37 - every day a little less ordinary and the
02:39 - way that the projects were graded is
02:41 - once people submitted them that
02:43 - approximately two weeks by the way to
02:44 - work on these projects my discord staff
02:46 - team went through and graded every
02:48 - single project out of 40. now they use
02:51 - the following four pieces of criteria
02:53 - the theme the functionality the code and
02:56 - the intuitiveness of the project to
02:57 - grade it then once all the projects were
02:59 - graded we were able to narrow it down to
03:01 - the top 15. once we had the top 15 i
03:04 - sent the 15 projects to nick white and
03:06 - ben ayowa who are two celebrity judges
03:08 - for this code gym so big thank you to
03:11 - them and we're gonna hear from them in a
03:12 - few minutes actually they also have
03:14 - great youtube channels which i'll leave
03:15 - in the description regardless though
03:17 - they then graded the projects that
03:19 - allowed us to narrow it down to the top
03:21 - five and those top five is what i'm
03:23 - showing you here now both nick and ben
03:25 - did select their favorite project and
03:28 - what they selected or the team that they
03:30 - selected is going to get a special prize
03:31 - outside of the prizes that i already
03:33 - mentioned uh and with that said we can
03:35 - dive into the projects apologize for the
03:38 - long intro just want to give you guys
03:39 - the full context here now we will look
03:41 - at the top five and then announce who
03:43 - the winning teams are all right so
03:45 - diving in here i have project number one
03:48 - i'm not showing these in any particular
03:49 - order just going through the different
03:51 - uh projects that are in the top five so
03:53 - this project here is called friend court
03:55 - now i believe that this is kind of like
03:57 - a tinder knockoff with discord we're
03:59 - gonna have a look at it in a second uh
04:01 - but the contributors here are soul ninja
04:04 - and i am saptorishi uh apologize if i'm
04:07 - mispronouncing that i'm probably am
04:09 - anyways you get the point to that is who
04:11 - created this so let's actually click in
04:13 - here to friend court already have it
04:15 - open uh we can see we met on discord
04:17 - meet new folks with new niches every day
04:19 - at friend court okay so let me log in
04:21 - with discord once i do that i'll be
04:22 - right back all right so i've just signed
04:24 - in here now i will note that i did use
04:26 - this previously when i used it the first
04:28 - time it did ask me to select my interest
04:30 - so that's why it's not doing it here but
04:32 - it looks like i can view different
04:34 - profiles here and swipe left and right
04:37 - uh based on if i like the profile and if
04:39 - i want to make a friend or get a match
04:40 - or whatever so i can see can i click on
04:43 - him no okay i can't click on him but i
04:44 - have interest we have the pronouns we
04:46 - have
04:47 - anything highlighted that we both like
04:49 - doing so we both like gaming we both
04:51 - love coding okay great
04:53 - let's give a like on that uh let's see
04:55 - if i can swipe left
04:56 - okay and it says go touch some grass uh
04:58 - try reloading to fetch more profiles if
05:00 - that doesn't work come back after some
05:02 - time i imagine just not many people have
05:04 - actually signed up for this website uh
05:06 - so that's probably why we're not seeing
05:07 - it and then i can go to matches here and
05:10 - if i had any matches i would see them
05:12 - but apparently i don't i guess you guys
05:14 - didn't want to uh to match with me on
05:15 - this platform
05:17 - anyways that is fine uh oh and if i come
05:19 - back okay there is actually more people
05:20 - so i had to refresh the feed so let's
05:22 - swipe and see if we get some matches
05:25 - okay matches
05:27 - uh let's see no unfortunately we don't
05:28 - have any okay so it looks like that's it
05:31 - for friend cord
05:33 - i'm not sure what else i could mess
05:34 - around with here seems like filter is
05:36 - blurred out for some reason and then of
05:38 - course i can log out
05:39 - and i get brought back to the home page
05:41 - overall great project here definitely
05:44 - fits the theme make life a little less
05:46 - ordinary everything is very clean it
05:48 - works it's intuitive great job guys
05:50 - let's move on to the next project
05:52 - alright so moving on here to another
05:54 - project this one is called proactive
05:56 - although i've seen it called proact as
05:58 - well just from scrolling through the

13:02 - post and there we go okay achievements
13:05 - habit master complete 60-day streak web
13:08 - usage okay so this is for the chrome
13:10 - extension so i can look at that in a
13:11 - second uh but yeah this looks really
13:13 - cool nice idea good project everything
13:16 - is very
13:18 - sleek everything looks good although
13:19 - when i like this i guess it's instantly
13:21 - moving up which i don't quite like
13:23 - because i don't get the feedback on
13:24 - actually pressing the button
13:26 - other than that though really good job
13:28 - guys and looks like of course i can log
13:30 - out from here okay so let me try that
13:31 - chrome extension then i'll be right back
13:33 - okay so i installed the chrome extension
13:34 - here was actually pretty easy to do you
13:36 - can see that it's right here zero to
13:37 - chad website time tracker it doesn't
13:40 - allow me to really do anything from the
13:41 - extension but it does actually now show
13:43 - me this graph here of minutes spent and
13:46 - on what website now of course i haven't
13:47 - been on long enough for it to give me
13:49 - really any information but it did kind
13:51 - of show up that it was registering my
13:53 - time and if i refresh here let's see if
13:55 - it shows anything else okay refresh one
13:57 - more time uh no it just says uh minutes
14:00 - spent and it was showing github there a
14:01 - second ago because i was on github
14:03 - anyways i'm going to trust this works
14:05 - i'm not going to go through and actually
14:06 - test this over you know the span of a
14:08 - few hours regardless though really great
14:10 - project guys all of these have been
14:11 - super impressive so far this is going to
14:13 - be a tough decision let's move on though
14:15 - to project number four alright so moving
14:17 - on to project number four now this one i
14:20 - believe is called uno life uh and this
14:22 - is by a bunch of cells fire plank and
14:24 - snowball now i'm not familiar with bunch
14:27 - of cells but i do know fire plank and
14:29 - snowball from the discord server these
14:30 - guys have been around for a very long
14:32 - time fireplank and i have actually
14:33 - played chess a few times on chess.com uh
14:36 - and yeah he beat me pretty much every
14:38 - single time because he's like way better
14:40 - anyways uh looks like this is made
14:42 - completely in rust i have a ross
14:43 - tutorial series right now they must have
14:45 - been watching that anyways let's have a
14:47 - quick look at this okay so looks like we
14:49 - actually need to run this from the
14:51 - desktop let me install it and we can
14:53 - have a look and see what uno life is all
14:55 - about
14:56 - alright so i've got it installed and

16:11 - okay i guess i can move with the arrow
16:13 - keys this reminds me of the snake game i
16:15 - made uh in in python looks very similar
16:18 - except the head of the snake doesn't
16:19 - have eyes like mine did
16:21 - okay nice so we can play snake let's see
16:23 - if i can kill myself okay there we go
16:25 - you lost i hit the edge of the screen
16:26 - okay let's do another game let's try
16:28 - 2048 uh how would i do this oh i just
16:31 - have to hit down
16:33 - uh or right or whatever on my keyboard i
16:35 - wouldn't mind if they showed the
16:36 - controls here on on the screen it would
16:39 - probably be a little bit easier
16:41 - but
16:42 - that's all good
16:43 - okay and then yeah we can play 2048 nice
16:45 - i'm not going to continue on with that
16:48 - uh 15 puzzle okay so we have 15 puzzles
16:51 - now i have no idea what this game is so
16:53 - it would be nice if there was some kind
16:54 - of instructions or something um or at
16:56 - least a little bit of info because again
16:58 - i just don't i don't even know what the
17:00 - goal is here uh maybe i'm trying to
17:02 - arrange it 1 to 15. i'm not going to go
17:04 - through because i could fully be doing
17:06 - the wrong thing but nice okay another
17:08 - game
17:09 - show meme
17:10 - nice okay and it just shows me a meme
17:13 - that's funny okay i'm not even going to
17:14 - read it all let's go to another one here
17:16 - though and click show meme and see if it
17:17 - shows me another one
17:20 - yep okay i get another me nice guess you

17:33 - games i trust those work uh nice awesome
17:35 - work here guys great project pretty
17:37 - unique to use rust i didn't see anyone
17:39 - else use rust and you made a desktop
17:41 - application as opposed to a website uh
17:43 - so definitely points for creativity with
17:45 - that said though let's go on to project
17:47 - number five alright so moving on to
17:49 - project number five now this one is
17:52 - random iq i want to find the
17:55 - contributors here i didn't see it on
17:57 - this page uh contributors uh looks like
17:59 - we just have m
18:01 - m yeah again i don't know how you it's
18:03 - how you pronounce this uh anyways looks
18:04 - like just one person here okay very good
18:07 - uh let's go back to the main repository
18:10 - okay let's go back uh and no board days
18:13 - again okay it's a website where people
18:14 - can get a random challenge finish it and
18:16 - then share the moment okay so let's go
18:18 - to
18:19 - random iq and let's see how this works
18:22 - okay so it said i have to log in first
18:23 - so let's login nice okay i got like a
18:26 - cool login form here i'm curious what
18:28 - they're actually using for this because
18:30 - it looks pre-built but let me sign in
18:32 - though and then we'll be right back all
18:33 - right so i've just signed in here and it
18:34 - looks like it's just giving me some
18:36 - challenges and i can accept them or
18:37 - refresh uh so let's just go through a
18:39 - few create a cookbook with your favorite
18:41 - recipes type cooking price free

18:57 - guess
18:58 - if i completed it i could add a picture
19:01 - related to the challenge and tell us how
19:02 - it went
19:03 - and then finish uh please vote this
19:05 - build field
19:07 - went well

19:24 - some filters let's make it education
19:26 - let's make it free
19:28 - let's
19:29 - refresh okay learn morse code okay
19:31 - that's cool that's a nice challenge
19:33 - let's accept that one
19:35 - all right looks like we're loading here
19:37 - okay let's get another one study foreign

20:03 - report that okay nice and we have the
20:05 - time uh hold the video game training
20:08 - with some friends
20:09 - sweet okay so i think that's it for this
20:12 - website simple but cool idea definitely
20:15 - does make life a little less ordinary so
20:17 - 100 fits the theme very good job guys
20:20 - again a few cosmetic things i think
20:22 - would have been kind of simple and just
20:23 - cleaned up the website quite a bit other
20:25 - than that though very nice job so that i
20:27 - believe was the fifth and final project
20:30 - now that we have gone through those let
20:32 - me take a quick break and then i'm going
20:34 - to announce to you the three winning
20:36 - projects as well as some special prizes
20:38 - uh based on some projects that our
20:40 - celebrity judges sorry have selected all
20:43 - right so i just spent a minute here
20:45 - going through each of these projects
20:46 - again making sure i didn't miss anything
20:48 - and that i went through all the features
20:49 - that i kind of briefly looked at in the
20:51 - demo thank you to everyone for
20:53 - participating these projects were super
20:55 - well done and this is a very difficult
20:57 - decision now i'm going to announce first
20:59 - second and third place but i want to
21:01 - quickly give a word to our celebrity
21:02 - judges who both selected their favorite

21:26 - used to do tutorials like tim but not so
21:28 - much anymore nice yeah you're working on
21:31 - void pet right now right you're kind of
21:32 - online game yes um believe it or not i'm
21:35 - building a game right now called void
21:36 - pet
21:37 - incredibly waste of time but this time
21:39 - it turned out pretty well uh we'll see
21:41 - how it goes
21:42 - yeah guys check it out it's pretty cool
21:44 - i've seen it a few times and there's a
21:45 - bunch of work being done on it anyways
21:47 - the reason we have you here is because
21:49 - you are judging some projects for us so
21:51 - i actually gave you the top 15 projects

22:02 - getting a special prize here
22:05 - my favorite project was uno life that
22:08 - made the rusty project because it was
22:11 - coded in rust every single game
22:14 - which i thought was quite impressive
22:15 - because i cannot code and rust but i
22:18 - hear russ is really cool so when i saw
22:20 - data and rust i was envious and i was
22:22 - like
22:23 - they deserve an extra prize because they
22:25 - put the extra effort to code all the
22:28 - things in russ when they could just done
22:29 - in python so that's why i liked it yeah
22:32 - awesome all right well there you go so i
22:34 - believe it is team rusty uno life you
22:37 - guys gonna be getting a special prize
22:38 - i'll talk to you about that in a second

22:50 - introduction in case anyone here doesn't
22:52 - already know you
22:53 - hey guys i'm nick white i also have a
22:56 - youtube channel where i do tech coding
22:58 - content some educational some
23:00 - entertainment and i've worked with tim
23:02 - before as a algo expert employee yeah
23:05 - and we've also done a few collab videos
23:07 - on nick's channel yeah and i think we
23:08 - have some other stuff regardless thank
23:10 - you nick for helping out helping us with
23:12 - judging and i just have one simple
23:14 - question for you what was your favorite
23:16 - project out of the ones that you looked
23:18 - at and why
23:20 - uh i really liked friend cord by touch
23:23 - some grass pro
23:25 - just because
23:26 - it was the most um polished project
23:30 - tinder swiping is not exactly easy to
23:32 - implement and then they
23:34 - uh hooked it up to discord which is
23:35 - pretty cool
23:36 - kind of a unique idea kind of a fun idea
23:39 - and um
23:40 - i don't know i just took more creativity
23:42 - i think than a lot of the other projects
23:44 - for sure i would definitely agree so
23:46 - thank you very much nick for helping out
23:47 - and being a celebrity judge that team is
23:49 - going to be getting a special prize
23:50 - because you selected them as your
23:52 - favorite project and hopefully we can
23:54 - have you back for the next code gem
23:56 - thank you for having me all right so big
23:58 - thank you here to ben and nick for
24:00 - selecting their favorite projects if you
24:02 - worked on one of the projects that they
24:04 - selected then you're going to be winning
24:05 - a programming expert license key
24:07 - completely for free every member of the
24:09 - team is going to get one
24:11 - all right so now without further ado
24:13 - let's now to the top three again very
24:16 - difficult decision and we're going to
24:17 - start with third place so drum roll
24:19 - please editors put in some suspenseful
24:21 - music or something the third place team
24:24 - is
24:25 - zero to chat so zero to chad third place
24:29 - let me just quickly find who wrote this
24:30 - again milan and name i cannot pronounce
24:34 - anise or something like that again i
24:36 - apologize uh this was your project you
24:39 - created kind of the habit tracker you
24:40 - had the uh what was this the chrome
24:43 - extension which i did verify was working
24:45 - afterwards you had achievements you had
24:47 - posts you had kind of like a social
24:48 - network aspect to this and i thought you
24:50 - guys did a really good job this was an
24:52 - awesome project and the only reason i'm
24:54 - actually placing this third as opposed
24:55 - to going higher was i just felt that the
24:57 - styling could have been done a little
24:59 - bit better it didn't look quite as
25:00 - polished as some of the other projects
25:02 - but again i think you guys did a really
25:04 - awesome job you had a great amount of
25:06 - features
25:07 - and definitely fit the theme as well
25:09 - making life a little less ordinary so
25:11 - thank you guys for your submission
25:12 - congratulations on third place i'll
25:14 - reach out to you on how you can claim
25:15 - your prize so now we move on to second
25:18 - and first place now this was a very
25:20 - difficult decision i'm not gonna make
25:22 - you wait any longer the second place
25:24 - project was dramatic pause please friend
25:28 - cord now friend cord this in my opinion
25:31 - was the most polished project i thought
25:32 - it was one of the best ideas out of all
25:34 - the ones that we had yes it is kind of
25:36 - cloning and mirroring uh you know
25:38 - something like uh tinder but i just
25:40 - thought it was a creative idea and it's
25:41 - really easy to use everything seemed to
25:43 - work unfortunately i didn't get any
25:45 - matches but i'm not going to penalize
25:46 - you for that and i just thought the
25:48 - styling was good everything was good
25:50 - generally again just no real negative
25:52 - feedback that i can give this project so
25:54 - that's why i selected it for second
25:55 - place uh and now once i announce first
25:57 - place i will just discuss why i chose
26:00 - that over this for first place so
26:02 - congratulations guys i'm gonna put up
26:03 - whoever made this on the screen and i'll
26:05 - reach out to you for your prizes but now
26:06 - we need to discuss who won first so the
26:10 - first place project here as i'm sure
26:12 - many of you have already guessed is
26:15 - proact now again this was a really
26:17 - difficult decision i was between friend
26:19 - court and pro act for first and second
26:21 - and the reason i went with proact here
26:23 - was just because i thought that this had
26:25 - a lot more features there was a lot more
26:27 - to it than friend cord and this as well
26:29 - was very polished everything with the
26:31 - exception of that one paragraph that i
26:33 - found that said lorem ipsum was you know
26:35 - pretty well done there was just so many
26:37 - different workouts we had three
26:39 - different modes inside of here yes it
26:41 - was a little bit laggy on this screen
26:43 - but i'm willing to forgive that just
26:44 - because of the sheer amount of content
26:46 - that was on this website i just thought
26:48 - that when we're comparing the two yes
26:50 - one was more polished than the other but
26:52 - this had so much stuff that i just
26:54 - thought it deserved the win i'm sure you
26:55 - put a ton of work into this and really
26:58 - that's kind of why i selected it for
26:59 - first place again i thought the idea was
27:01 - good definitely does make life less
27:03 - ordinary and overall just a really good
27:05 - job on all these projects making it very
27:07 - difficult for me to decide so i'm gonna
27:09 - put up who made this project on the
27:10 - screen congratulations to all of our
27:12 - winners to who these celebrity judges
27:14 - selected and really to everyone who
27:16 - submitted a project i do these code gems
27:18 - that you guys can have fun so that i can
27:20 - have a cool video to post every few
27:21 - months and showcase some community
27:23 - projects and if you guys like this idea
27:25 - of kind of showcasing what people in the
27:27 - community have made we can do this more
27:29 - informally as well going forward where i
27:31 - showed just some cool community projects
27:33 - that weren't necessarily made uh just
27:35 - for something like this like a coding
27:37 - competition so with that said i am going
27:39 - to wrap up the video here again
27:41 - congratulations to everyone thank you
27:43 - all for participating thank you to my
27:45 - discord staff team thank you to algo
27:47 - expert for sponsoring this competition
27:49 - and i have no more thank you so i'll
27:50 - wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed make
27:52 - sure to leave a like subscribe to the
27:53 - channel and i will see you in another
27:55 - one
27:58 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

in this video i'm going to be sharing with you some awesome programming projects that were made as a part of a coding competition that i host that we call it timothon or a code gym now all of the information on how you join this how you get notified on when these events are going on is in my discord server so make sure you join that from the link in the description and before i say anything else i want to give a massive thank you to my discord staff team who pretty much organizes and runs all of these events as well as a bunch of other community related stuff which again you can find from the discord server now in this video specifically i'm going to be showcasing the top five projects from this coding competition i'm then going to be announcing the winning team so first second and third place and then i'm gonna be giving away some additional prizes uh that we'll talk about later on now for this code gym we had some awesome prizes we're giving away 800 400 and 200 usd to the first second and third place teams and this is courtesy of algo expert who has sponsored this code gym you guys know i work with algo expert in fact i have my own kind of course with them called programming expert you can check out all of their information from the link in the description they were kind enough to uh sponsor this code gem and in case you're unaware algo expert has some new products out so they have front expert machine learning expert they have systems expert and then of course the original algo expert which prepares you for technical coding interviews as well as all those other products pretty much but with some more specialization so check them out massive thank you to them for sponsoring this and they're going to be giving me some programming expert licenses to give away to you guys as kind of special prizes i'll talk about who's going to win those and how that works in a minute for now though let me dive into kind of the theme and just a bit of context and then we'll get into all of the projects and if i'm boring you then you can skip forward there should be some time stamps when i actually start kind of demoing the top five projects all right so i'm just on the code jam information page here i'm going to give you a little bit of context first thing to note if you want to read any of this yourself you can go to the website twtcodejam.net i also want to give a massive thank you to everyone who participated here as well as my discord staff team for organizing this doing all of the grading which i'm going to talk about in a second and generally just spending a bunch of time helping out the community really appreciate it guys i also want to note if you did not get in the top 5 or the top 15 or anything like that please don't be discouraged please submit again i've seen many of you guys submit over multiple code gems and you just keep getting better and better and that's really the point of this yes the prizes are nice but i want to give you guys an opportunity to practice and create some cool coding projects regardless though the theme for this code jam was make every day a little less ordinary and the way that the projects were graded is once people submitted them that approximately two weeks by the way to work on these projects my discord staff team went through and graded every single project out of 40. now they use the following four pieces of criteria the theme the functionality the code and the intuitiveness of the project to grade it then once all the projects were graded we were able to narrow it down to the top 15. once we had the top 15 i sent the 15 projects to nick white and ben ayowa who are two celebrity judges for this code gym so big thank you to them and we're gonna hear from them in a few minutes actually they also have great youtube channels which i'll leave in the description regardless though they then graded the projects that allowed us to narrow it down to the top five and those top five is what i'm showing you here now both nick and ben did select their favorite project and what they selected or the team that they selected is going to get a special prize outside of the prizes that i already mentioned uh and with that said we can dive into the projects apologize for the long intro just want to give you guys the full context here now we will look at the top five and then announce who the winning teams are all right so diving in here i have project number one i'm not showing these in any particular order just going through the different uh projects that are in the top five so this project here is called friend court now i believe that this is kind of like a tinder knockoff with discord we're gonna have a look at it in a second uh but the contributors here are soul ninja and i am saptorishi uh apologize if i'm mispronouncing that i'm probably am anyways you get the point to that is who created this so let's actually click in here to friend court already have it open uh we can see we met on discord meet new folks with new niches every day at friend court okay so let me log in with discord once i do that i'll be right back all right so i've just signed in here now i will note that i did use this previously when i used it the first time it did ask me to select my interest so that's why it's not doing it here but it looks like i can view different profiles here and swipe left and right uh based on if i like the profile and if i want to make a friend or get a match or whatever so i can see can i click on him no okay i can't click on him but i have interest we have the pronouns we have anything highlighted that we both like doing so we both like gaming we both love coding okay great let's give a like on that uh let's see if i can swipe left okay and it says go touch some grass uh try reloading to fetch more profiles if that doesn't work come back after some time i imagine just not many people have actually signed up for this website uh so that's probably why we're not seeing it and then i can go to matches here and if i had any matches i would see them but apparently i don't i guess you guys didn't want to uh to match with me on this platform anyways that is fine uh oh and if i come back okay there is actually more people so i had to refresh the feed so let's swipe and see if we get some matches okay matches uh let's see no unfortunately we don't have any okay so it looks like that's it for friend cord i'm not sure what else i could mess around with here seems like filter is blurred out for some reason and then of course i can log out and i get brought back to the home page overall great project here definitely fits the theme make life a little less ordinary everything is very clean it works it's intuitive great job guys let's move on to the next project alright so moving on here to another project this one is called proactive although i've seen it called proact as well just from scrolling through the readme here uh now this is by ben robo that's the team name as well as the participant so just one person and let's just click right into the app and start having a look here so making life less ordinary the one and only app you would ever need to stay motivated okay let's just go through here we have about okay so shows us who wrote this very nice uh let's go to features we have motivational quotes mood melody daily fitness very nice although this says lorem ipsum so i guess he didn't quite finish this paragraph here that's fine i won't penalize that too heavily as long as everything else works let's go to home get started okay we're gonna load in here and let's see what we can do okay so looks like we have motivational quotes on this page uh looks like i can flip through them excuse me i get some cool backgrounds i can favorite them okay so let's favorite that let's favorite another one uh can i download this yeah so i can click download or i can escape nice uh it looks like i can share oh sorry feature not available okay that's fine try downloading and then share as pics notification set how many quote reminders you'd like to get every day that's cool okay i can go through the different categories i don't know who would want 80 quotes per day but i'm not going to go through this i trust that works okay let's go back let's go here uh let's go view reminders okay no reminders let's go categories looks like categories doesn't do anything okay and favorites and then i can view the quotes that i've favorited and go in here nice okay overall pretty good although i'm not sure about the categories thing i imagine he just forgot to link that page or something okay let's go to the next section here we have mood we'll give this a second to load okay medi uh brilliant things happen in calm minds become your brilliant very nice very motivational uh let's click a mood here relax okay come on um there you go okay so it just takes a second to pop up uh let me turn on my speakers here i imagine this is going to play some music and actually will you guys be able to hear this let me just change this so that you guys can hear the music if it starts coming on okay i think you guys should really

continue okay great good day tim you have no workouts oh this is cool oh wow okay there's a lot of stuff here in this workout page damn how did you get all this stuff did you pull this from some website or something i'm curious uh i guess you could have just put in a bunch of names and pick some different uh what do you call it images for them okay let's let's click into one here there's a video showing me how to do this wow okay this is impressive you did a lot of stuff here can i pull this up yeah i can i get some information about how this works wow this is uh very well done and we have different categories here equipment required and this just keeps going yeah you must have pulled this from from some website okay achievements we have achievements based on workouts that i've done okay very nice i have my profile okay tim i guess i can just log out i guess that's all i have here for for profile unless let's click here there we go okay profile name tag name oh no that's adding a workout sorry profile okay the profile page it looks like there's something behind here but i guess maybe this is all for profile okay that's fine let's just do something let's say test test let's go okay just just insert some random numbers here just make sure this works add workout and there we go okay it gets added to the page wow i'm impressed i wasn't expecting you to have so much stuff for each one of these categories very well done i think i covered most of this if i keep going it's gonna be very long uh let's move on to the next project all right so moving on here to project number three this one has a hilarious name zero to chad uh very nice very clever introduction this is zero to chad your allinone selfimprovement app become the best version of yourself okay learn and share ideas manage and track habits show your achievement monitor your time usage on different websites okay this is by team coffee i've seen this team before thank you guys for participating again we have milan and any i'm not even going to try i don't know how to pronounce that i apologize uh let's click in here though oh our chrome extension okay so chrome extension for monitoring and i guess that's what it is so let me install this chrome extension and try it out okay so actually i lied there is a chrome extension i will install that after but there's a main website the chrome extension seems to be kind of an addon for that for tracking your time uh so let's log in for now though or let's take action okay username tim let's just go with fake email like tim gmail.com if i could type here uh okay is it gonna let me have a weak password here let's see sign up okay very good we can save that select the topics that interest you uh let's go crypto business finance fitness let's just select a few here programming technology okay next uh select your habits okay um these are not all gonna be accurate here i'm gonna make myself look a lot better than i am but let's do this okay let's go next uh training more than three habits at a time would be inefficient okay is only letting me select a few or no it's just giving me a warning there that's fine okay next and wow okay this looks awesome so i have home explore habits my posts achievements web usage i have a quote of the day you guys have made some really impressive stuff especially considering this only takes you guys two weeks to do okay track your habits uh click on more okay i have all the other habits here let's go to explore you might like these collections i guess these are like tweets or something that i can view let's click on this no it almost is just like a little blog post or something they have here okay that's cool uh what else c plus plus versus rust comparison very nice recommended post don't code all day go touch some grass very nice thanks your mom uh warren buffett nice oh wow you guys have like a whole feed here of different posts okay let's go to my post let's make one post uh regular post test posts cool project okay tags uh selfimprovement why not okay let's post that uh okay it should be at least 50 characters long you guys going to make me do this okay i think that should be 50. let's post and there we go okay achievements habit master complete 60day streak web usage okay so this is for the chrome extension so i can look at that in a second uh but yeah this looks really cool nice idea good project everything is very sleek everything looks good although when i like this i guess it's instantly moving up which i don't quite like because i don't get the feedback on actually pressing the button other than that though really good job guys and looks like of course i can log out from here okay so let me try that chrome extension then i'll be right back okay so i installed the chrome extension here was actually pretty easy to do you can see that it's right here zero to chad website time tracker it doesn't allow me to really do anything from the extension but it does actually now show me this graph here of minutes spent and on what website now of course i haven't been on long enough for it to give me really any information but it did kind of show up that it was registering my time and if i refresh here let's see if it shows anything else okay refresh one more time uh no it just says uh minutes spent and it was showing github there a second ago because i was on github anyways i'm going to trust this works i'm not going to go through and actually test this over you know the span of a few hours regardless though really great project guys all of these have been super impressive so far this is going to be a tough decision let's move on though to project number four alright so moving on to project number four now this one i believe is called uno life uh and this is by a bunch of cells fire plank and snowball now i'm not familiar with bunch of cells but i do know fire plank and snowball from the discord server these guys have been around for a very long time fireplank and i have actually played chess a few times on chess.com uh and yeah he beat me pretty much every single time because he's like way better anyways uh looks like this is made completely in rust i have a ross tutorial series right now they must have been watching that anyways let's have a quick look at this okay so looks like we actually need to run this from the desktop let me install it and we can have a look and see what uno life is all about alright so i've got it installed and opened up it was actually super easy to do this so thank you guys for that uh looks like i have home games settings and about so let's go to about uh just give some information wow you guys are 16 and 14. okay well that's impressive already uh you guys are coding your own apps here and in the top five of this code gem uh we have settings okay so i can reset the high score i can change from light or dark theme this is light theme okay actually let's leave it on dark theme for everyone let's go to games here so tictactoe wordlesnake2048 i know to play all of these okay let's click okay i guess we'll go here okay here here here okay it's a draw makes sense i can change to man vs man purple verse ai i can reset very nice let's try wordle i guess i just type something um i actually never play this game let's just see though enter okay heard nice none of those are in it that's great uh can we do something like worst okay this is gonna be bad i'm not gonna play the entire game very nice though i trust that works let's go to snake okay i guess i can move with the arrow keys this reminds me of the snake game i made uh in in python looks very similar except the head of the snake doesn't have eyes like mine did okay nice so we can play snake let's see if i can kill myself okay there we go you lost i hit the edge of the screen okay let's do another game let's try 2048 uh how would i do this oh i just have to hit down uh or right or whatever on my keyboard i wouldn't mind if they showed the controls here on on the screen it would probably be a little bit easier but that's all good okay and then yeah we can play 2048 nice i'm not going to continue on with that uh 15 puzzle okay so we have 15 puzzles now i have no idea what this game is so it would be nice if there was some kind of instructions or something um or at least a little bit of info because again i just don't i don't even know what the goal is here uh maybe i'm trying to arrange it 1 to 15. i'm not going to go through because i could fully be doing the wrong thing but nice okay another game show meme nice okay and it just shows me a meme that's funny okay i'm not even going to read it all let's go to another one here though and click show meme and see if it shows me another one yep okay i get another me nice guess you guys have multiple uh sweet click on the games tab okay click on the settings tab check out uh click on the about us tab i think i went through everything here i know i went quickly through the games but you guys get the point they're basic games i trust those work uh nice awesome work here guys great project pretty unique to use rust i didn't see anyone else use rust and you made a desktop application as opposed to a website uh so definitely points for creativity with that said though let's go on to project number five alright so moving on to project number five now this one is random iq i want to find the contributors here i didn't see it on this page uh contributors uh looks like we just have m m yeah again i don't know how you it's how you pronounce this uh anyways looks like just one person here okay very good uh let's go back to the main repository okay let's go back uh and no board days again okay it's a website where people can get a random challenge finish it and then share the moment okay so let's go to random iq and let's see how this works okay so it said i have to log in first so let's login nice okay i got like a cool login form here i'm curious what they're actually using for this because it looks prebuilt but let me sign in though and then we'll be right back all right so i've just signed in here and it looks like it's just giving me some challenges and i can accept them or refresh uh so let's just go through a few create a cookbook with your favorite recipes type cooking price free participants one okay let's accept the challenge let's see what happens when we do that uh okay challenge is added let's click on that let's see and there we go okay create a cookbook with your favorite recipes and then i guess if i completed it i could add a picture related to the challenge and tell us how it went and then finish uh please vote this build field went well okay and is that gonna work maybe i need to add an image too okay that's fine we'll we'll get out of this for now okay finish challenges randomize let's go back here let's do some filters let's make it education let's make it free let's refresh okay learn morse code okay that's cool that's a nice challenge let's accept that one all right looks like we're loading here okay let's get another one study foreign language okay we can accept let's go to your challenges and let's see if they're all here and nice okay we get them all showing up and then i imagine once i finish them i'd be able to have a look here at all my finished challenges let's go to explore and i can see what others have done okay so i can see what challenges people have completed you can like them nice okay this is cool and yeah the footage at the bottom here that makes sense sweet can i click into this oh i can report that okay nice and we have the time uh hold the video game training with some friends sweet okay so i think that's it for this website simple but cool idea definitely does make life a little less ordinary so 100 fits the theme very good job guys again a few cosmetic things i think would have been kind of simple and just cleaned up the website quite a bit other than that though very nice job so that i believe was the fifth and final project now that we have gone through those let me take a quick break and then i'm going to announce to you the three winning projects as well as some special prizes uh based on some projects that our celebrity judges sorry have selected all right so i just spent a minute here going through each of these projects again making sure i didn't miss anything and that i went through all the features that i kind of briefly looked at in the demo thank you to everyone for participating these projects were super well done and this is a very difficult decision now i'm going to announce first second and third place but i want to quickly give a word to our celebrity judges who both selected their favorite project and those projects are going to be getting a prize so let's now go over and talk to ben and nick all right so ben thanks for joining me man thanks for being a celebrity judge i just want to give you a chance to quickly introduce yourself in case anyone doesn't know you here hello everyone my name is ben you can find me on the internet on youtube or tick tock and i like to do tech stuff as well i used to do tutorials like tim but not so much anymore nice yeah you're working on void pet right now right you're kind of online game yes um believe it or not i'm building a game right now called void pet incredibly waste of time but this time it turned out pretty well uh we'll see how it goes yeah guys check it out it's pretty cool i've seen it a few times and there's a bunch of work being done on it anyways the reason we have you here is because you are judging some projects for us so i actually gave you the top 15 projects to judge uh and you came up with what your favorite one was as well as gave them all scores so i just wanted to ask you here what was your favorite project and why because they're going to be getting a special prize here my favorite project was uno life that made the rusty project because it was coded in rust every single game which i thought was quite impressive because i cannot code and rust but i hear russ is really cool so when i saw data and rust i was envious and i was like they deserve an extra prize because they put the extra effort to code all the things in russ when they could just done in python so that's why i liked it yeah awesome all right well there you go so i believe it is team rusty uno life you guys gonna be getting a special prize i'll talk to you about that in a second ben thanks so much for helping out and hopefully uh we'll have you as a judge for the next one yeah thanks for having me tim hey nick thanks for joining us here and being a celebrity judge just want to give you a quick second to give yourself an introduction in case anyone here doesn't already know you hey guys i'm nick white i also have a youtube channel where i do tech coding content some educational some entertainment and i've worked with tim before as a algo expert employee yeah and we've also done a few collab videos on nick's channel yeah and i think we have some other stuff regardless thank you nick for helping out helping us with judging and i just have one simple question for you what was your favorite project out of the ones that you looked at and why uh i really liked friend cord by touch some grass pro just because it was the most um polished project tinder swiping is not exactly easy to implement and then they uh hooked it up to discord which is pretty cool kind of a unique idea kind of a fun idea and um i don't know i just took more creativity i think than a lot of the other projects for sure i would definitely agree so thank you very much nick for helping out and being a celebrity judge that team is going to be getting a special prize because you selected them as your favorite project and hopefully we can have you back for the next code gem thank you for having me all right so big thank you here to ben and nick for selecting their favorite projects if you worked on one of the projects that they selected then you're going to be winning a programming expert license key completely for free every member of the team is going to get one all right so now without further ado let's now to the top three again very difficult decision and we're going to start with third place so drum roll please editors put in some suspenseful music or something the third place team is zero to chat so zero to chad third place let me just quickly find who wrote this again milan and name i cannot pronounce anise or something like that again i apologize uh this was your project you created kind of the habit tracker you had the uh what was this the chrome extension which i did verify was working afterwards you had achievements you had posts you had kind of like a social network aspect to this and i thought you guys did a really good job this was an awesome project and the only reason i'm actually placing this third as opposed to going higher was i just felt that the styling could have been done a little bit better it didn't look quite as polished as some of the other projects but again i think you guys did a really awesome job you had a great amount of features and definitely fit the theme as well making life a little less ordinary so thank you guys for your submission congratulations on third place i'll reach out to you on how you can claim your prize so now we move on to second and first place now this was a very difficult decision i'm not gonna make you wait any longer the second place project was dramatic pause please friend cord now friend cord this in my opinion was the most polished project i thought it was one of the best ideas out of all the ones that we had yes it is kind of cloning and mirroring uh you know something like uh tinder but i just thought it was a creative idea and it's really easy to use everything seemed to work unfortunately i didn't get any matches but i'm not going to penalize you for that and i just thought the styling was good everything was good generally again just no real negative feedback that i can give this project so that's why i selected it for second place uh and now once i announce first place i will just discuss why i chose that over this for first place so congratulations guys i'm gonna put up whoever made this on the screen and i'll reach out to you for your prizes but now we need to discuss who won first so the first place project here as i'm sure many of you have already guessed is proact now again this was a really difficult decision i was between friend court and pro act for first and second and the reason i went with proact here was just because i thought that this had a lot more features there was a lot more to it than friend cord and this as well was very polished everything with the exception of that one paragraph that i found that said lorem ipsum was you know pretty well done there was just so many different workouts we had three different modes inside of here yes it was a little bit laggy on this screen but i'm willing to forgive that just because of the sheer amount of content that was on this website i just thought that when we're comparing the two yes one was more polished than the other but this had so much stuff that i just thought it deserved the win i'm sure you put a ton of work into this and really that's kind of why i selected it for first place again i thought the idea was good definitely does make life less ordinary and overall just a really good job on all these projects making it very difficult for me to decide so i'm gonna put up who made this project on the screen congratulations to all of our winners to who these celebrity judges selected and really to everyone who submitted a project i do these code gems that you guys can have fun so that i can have a cool video to post every few months and showcase some community projects and if you guys like this idea of kind of showcasing what people in the community have made we can do this more informally as well going forward where i showed just some cool community projects that weren't necessarily made uh just for something like this like a coding competition so with that said i am going to wrap up the video here again congratulations to everyone thank you all for participating thank you to my discord staff team thank you to algo expert for sponsoring this competition and i have no more thank you so i'll wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another one
