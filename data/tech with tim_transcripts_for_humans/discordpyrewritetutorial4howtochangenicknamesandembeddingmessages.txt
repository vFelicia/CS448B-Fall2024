00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to their
00:01 - discord rewrite tutorial so in today's
00:04 - video when I would be showing you is how
00:05 - to change member nicknames how to embed
00:08 - messages so they look like nicer how to
00:11 - check and check for like swear words or
00:14 - stuff like that and delete those
00:15 - messages and I think that's about it for
00:17 - this tutorial now I do apologize as I
00:20 - wanted to show you guys how to do voice
00:22 - chat stuff and I was messing with it and
00:24 - I can get in the voice chat and I can
00:25 - leave the voice chat that's all fine but
00:28 - whenever I try to actually play any
00:29 - audio in that chat I'm getting a lot of
00:31 - issues and I messed around with it for
00:32 - about two hours this morning and it
00:34 - seems that I need to install some kind
00:36 - of library that I can't figure out so
00:38 - until I get that unfortunately I can't
00:40 - show you guys I need the voice chat
00:41 - stuff but if any of you know how to do
00:43 - that voice chat stuff please don't
00:45 - hesitate to let me know on discord or
00:47 - whatever on my forum on tech with Tim
00:50 - net because I'd be happy to have a look
00:51 - at that and try to do a tutorial on that
00:53 - but right now this will probably be the
00:54 - last video in the series until maybe I
00:56 - decide to continue it on later on so
00:59 - anyways let's go ahead and get started
01:00 - and I think the first thing I'm gonna do
01:02 - is tell you how to change someone's
01:04 - nickname because that's probably a
01:05 - pretty useful thing and it's actually
01:06 - not as intuitive as it seems from
01:07 - reading the documentation so to do this
01:10 - what we're gonna do or like what I'm
01:12 - gonna do is if someone tries to change
01:14 - their nickname to Tim I am just gonna
01:16 - change it back to what it used to be or
01:19 - if they didn't have a nickname before
01:20 - I'm gonna like make their nickname like
01:22 - you can't do that or something okay so
01:25 - to do this we need to do another event
01:27 - so I'm going to add client events and
01:30 - then down here I believe it is a sync
01:33 - define and then on underscore member
01:36 - underscore updates I think that's it and
01:39 - then it takes two parameters which is
01:41 - before if I spelt that correctly and
01:45 - after like that so we have before and
01:47 - after and what these are gonna represent
01:48 - is the member so it gives you a member
01:50 - I'm not sure if you've been reading the
01:52 - documentation but if you have you'll
01:53 - know what that means before and then
01:56 - afterwards and the afterwards will
01:57 - obviously have all changed properties so
01:59 - for example like a new nickname a new
02:02 - rule etc so let me actually bring this
02:04 - up to show you okay that's something
02:06 - else I was looking at be out on member
02:08 - update so it takes before and after and
02:10 - these are the things
02:11 - that will trigger this function to run
02:12 - so if they change their status the game
02:15 - they're playing an avatar and nickname
02:16 - or the rule so we're just gonna deal
02:19 - with nickname but if you wanted to see
02:20 - like if they were changing what game
02:22 - they're playing or status this will
02:24 - trigger for that as well just you know
02:25 - so she I don't know why the Bloods
02:27 - running right now but that's okay so
02:29 - what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna get
02:30 - the nickname that they tried to change
02:32 - to write or that they did change you so
02:34 - I'll say um I'll just say after actually
02:37 - I don't know if I could use a Nick will
02:39 - say n is equal to after dot Nick okay
02:43 - now this is gonna stand for the nickname
02:45 - they attempted to change Jude now if
02:47 - they didn't change their nickname this
02:49 - after is gonna be set to none or it's
02:51 - gonna be set to the nickname they
02:52 - already work so we will do here is will
02:56 - say if and and we'll just do that which
02:59 - means if it's anything and it's not none
03:01 - because if it's none this this won't
03:03 - trigger and we won't go into this if
03:05 - statement meaning we're not going to
03:06 - change the nickname to what it was
03:08 - before if that makes sense so
03:10 - essentially this could be a non value
03:11 - because it's gonna trigger for five
03:13 - different things so if they don't change
03:14 - their nickname this will be none okay
03:16 - makes sense so if n so now what we'll do
03:18 - is we'll say if and lower so lowercase
03:22 - equals equals Tim then we will change
03:26 - this and we can even go as far as to say
03:28 - if it contains Tim so m dot lower dot
03:31 - count and then here we'll put Tim is
03:36 - greater than zero so if they try to put
03:38 - Tim anywhere in their nickname we'll
03:40 - just change their nickname back to what
03:42 - it was before so in here now we got to
03:44 - check if they had a nickname before so
03:46 - we'll say glass doesn't like the last
03:49 - nickname it goes with four dot Nick okay
03:52 - and then if last will simply say that
03:56 - there we're gonna edit their nickname so
03:58 - it is their last nickname and otherwise
04:00 - we'll just change their nickname to like
04:02 - a set value okay so if last so if they
04:05 - did have a nickname let's change it back
04:07 - so the way we do that is we're gonna say
04:09 - after dot edit I think it started it let
04:13 - me look here dot edit yep and then we're
04:15 - gonna do Nick equals and then what their
04:18 - last nickname was which would be last
04:20 - okay now if the
04:22 - didn't have a nickname before this
04:23 - wouldn't work obviously right or it
04:25 - would make their nickname none which we
04:26 - don't want so what I'm gonna do now is
04:28 - let's say they didn't have one before
04:29 - they tried to change it to that well too
04:32 - bad for them I'm gonna change their
04:33 - nickname to no you can't do that so to
04:35 - do that we'll just go to Nick equals no
04:40 - stop that like that okay exclamation
04:43 - point I think that he's allowed a new
04:45 - nickname
04:46 - well maybe let's remove it in case okay
04:48 - anyways so we'll do that and that's now
04:49 - gonna work to change nicknames now the
04:52 - thing is with this bought and I'll run
04:54 - it quickly and I'm actually I'll show
04:55 - you my phone because I'm gonna test it
04:57 - it has tits oh I already was messing
04:59 - with stuff here it has to have a higher
05:01 - permission than the person you're trying
05:03 - to change nickname so right now I
05:05 - actually went ahead and added two bought
05:06 - permission to this and I just gave it
05:08 - the administrator but if I try to change
05:11 - like the system owner or the server
05:13 - owner which would be me my own nickname
05:15 - it won't work it'll say there's a
05:16 - permission error because the bot doesn't
05:18 - have as high purpose a permission as Tim
05:20 - does so we can't change that
05:22 - so what I have to do actually is go to
05:24 - server settings go to what is it roles
05:28 - and I just created a new bot our new
05:30 - role cold bot so you can just literally
05:31 - click plus a new role give it a name and
05:33 - just make it administrator okay and then
05:35 - just assign that role to your boss to do
05:38 - that you go here you go plus and then
05:40 - you just give it that role and then that
05:41 - way now it'll be able to change like at
05:44 - everyone so like any person lower than
05:46 - the server owners nickname I think that
05:47 - makes sense to you guys so let's
05:49 - actually I was gonna test that wasn't it
05:51 - so I have a new another discord account
05:53 - on my phone and I'm just gonna type
05:55 - something I'm gonna try to change my
05:57 - nickname so actually I'll type something
05:58 - first I'm on my phone right now so you
06:00 - guys can see so high and you can see my
06:02 - nickname right now is yes so now I'll
06:04 - just change my nickname in here by just
06:05 - going change nickname and I'll try to
06:08 - change it to like Tim one two three okay
06:12 - so I tried to do that and that works
06:15 - really what's our issue here edit Nick
06:18 - equals last remembered edit was never
06:20 - awaited okay so that's what we had to do
06:22 - after out of that so we actually just
06:23 - have to go in this code here and go
06:25 - await because this is something that
06:28 - like could take a second right so we'll
06:30 - say oh wait like that and now if we
06:32 - close the bought and try it again
06:33 - hopefully this
06:35 - well this will fix this for us so we'll
06:38 - go to discard here and now we'll just
06:41 - try to change the nickname one more time
06:43 - so you can see right now my name is Tim
06:45 - one two three and we might run into an
06:47 - issue here but we'll see
06:49 - so change nickname to Tim one two three
06:52 - four I click Save and now you went back
06:55 - okay so the reason running to an issue
06:58 - is because my nickname okay I'll show
07:00 - you guys in a second it already contains
07:01 - Tim so it has like an issue but let's
07:03 - just make it tea
07:04 - so now you can see it's tea on my screen
07:05 - I don't know why I just pointed as if
07:07 - you guys we're gonna see that but now
07:08 - we'll change it back
07:10 - so change nickname and we'll make it Tim
07:12 - okay ready so if I click it it goes Tim
07:14 - and then it goes right back to tea so it
07:15 - doesn't let me change that nickname now
07:17 - if I didn't have a nickname so I think I
07:19 - can remove it it'll just get rid of it
07:22 - so that's there's my name okay and now
07:24 - if I try to change it so change nickname
07:26 - to like Tim and save it now it just says
07:31 - no stop that because I didn't have a
07:32 - nickname before so it just renames it -
07:34 - no stop that okay makes sense I think so
07:37 - alright it's okay so what are we doing
07:39 - now so we've got the nickname thing down
07:41 - you guys can play with this as probably
07:42 - isn't the best way to do this especially
07:43 - if you already had a name that contains
07:45 - a Tim in it then like you would give you
07:47 - some issues but anyways what we'll do
07:49 - now is we'll work with deleting messages
07:51 - so let's say there's a few messages or a
07:53 - few things that if they appear in a
07:54 - message we want to delete them so for
07:56 - example I'll just going to say bad
07:58 - underscore words equals two and I'll put
08:01 - a list of words here and some bad words
08:03 - let's just make one bad okay bad and
08:06 - like stop obviously you can make these
08:09 - swear words if you want but I'm just not
08:11 - gonna type them out bad stop let's say
08:13 - 45 is a bad word - okay so if we want um
08:16 - habit so it automatically like moderates
08:18 - these words and doesn't let them show up
08:20 - in a message strain we'll just delete
08:21 - the message if they ever appear in any
08:23 - of the messages so the way to do that is
08:25 - we'll just make a for loop and we'll
08:26 - loop through all these words and check
08:27 - if the message that was sent contains
08:29 - these words so let's say forward in bad
08:32 - underscore words like this if what do
08:36 - you call it will say message got content
08:40 - or actually we're going to do if word is
08:42 - in message content I think that will
08:45 - actually work
08:48 - maybe we went after this message content
08:50 - count word I think the other one would
08:52 - work as well but I want to be safe so
08:53 - this message account outward is greater
08:55 - than zero which means one of these words
08:57 - appeared in our messages then what we
09:00 - will do is well just print to the
09:01 - console and we'll say like a bad word or
09:05 - sad just so we know and then we're gonna
09:07 - actually delete that message so the way
09:09 - we do that is say message dot channel
09:12 - dot courage I think let me have a look
09:16 - that might not be actually what is known
09:17 - is that dot purge and then we're gonna
09:20 - put limits equals and in this case I'm
09:22 - just gonna put one now if you want to
09:24 - delete like a ton of messages you could
09:25 - put I think the max is 125 that you can
09:27 - do for deleting the you guys can play
09:30 - with that this is how many messages up
09:31 - we're gonna delete so in this case since
09:33 - I just sent one message where's gonna
09:34 - delete that one I mean that should work
09:36 - fine let's test this out so I stop run
09:39 - go back to discord now I can actually
09:41 - use this account and what were some of
09:43 - those ones that were bad 45 oh and oh
09:47 - our BOTS is is it online what are we
09:50 - getting channel delimit purge runtime ah
09:53 - we need to await this again by bad
09:55 - awaits that stop run okay maybe let's
09:59 - see this it works this time
10:01 - let's go 45 and there we go it just
10:04 - instantly deletes our and this is a bad
10:06 - word was said if I type bad hello like
10:08 - what's in the same sentence again it
10:11 - removes outward so obviously you'd
10:13 - probably do that with like swear words
10:14 - or maybe just some words you don't want
10:15 - people to say but that shows you how you
10:17 - can do that pretty easily okay last
10:20 - thing that I was gonna show you what was
10:23 - that I don't remember let's have a look
10:25 - I was gonna show you oh how we can embed
10:28 - messages yes okay so actually I have an
10:30 - example here see how I have like this
10:32 - message it looks like pretty decent
10:34 - compared to just like having the bots
10:36 - send like a standard message well show
10:37 - you how we can do this and this is known
10:39 - as embedding so we it's actually pretty
10:42 - pretty useful and it makes it look like
10:43 - decent you guys can see here so the way
10:45 - we'll do that essentially is I want if
10:47 - someone types help or like exclamation
10:49 - point help I want to show them that nice
10:51 - output with all the different commands
10:53 - like easy to see with a little
10:54 - description so we can do that as well
10:56 - just say if message dot content
11:00 - built that correctly equals equals and
11:02 - that exclamation point
11:04 - help like that what we'll do is we'll
11:06 - start that embedding process so I'm
11:08 - gonna say embed is actually equal to
11:10 - discord dot embed like this now inside
11:14 - these brackets this takes a title which
11:16 - I'm going to say is equal to a help like
11:19 - that okay so like help on but we'll do
11:23 - that and it takes a description as well
11:24 - now the description I'll just say some
11:28 - useful commands why not okay so to show
11:33 - you what these ones are that would be
11:35 - this is the title and this is the
11:37 - description and these are what it's
11:39 - going to be known as I'm gonna have to
11:42 - look at it a what is it called here
11:44 - field a field okay field so these are
11:47 - fields and we can add as many of these
11:48 - as we want and you'll see if I go full
11:50 - screen here they show up like
11:52 - dynamically so they're preside each
11:54 - other and it's just like a nice looking
11:55 - kind of output so the way we do the
11:57 - fields is we just say embed dot add
12:00 - underscore field and then for the field
12:02 - it takes a name and a value say name
12:04 - equals and for this one we'll do the
12:06 - first command which will just say is
12:07 - what hello and then for the value we'll
12:10 - set that equal to greets the user okay
12:14 - now if we have another one so embed dot
12:17 - add underscore field that would be our
12:19 - other command right so we should do like
12:20 - next to my exploit users probably need
12:23 - an equal sign there as well and then for
12:25 - value we'll just say exactly what it's
12:28 - going to do so little description so
12:30 - prints number users like that okay so
12:36 - now I think to show this yeah to show
12:40 - this what we need to do is we need to
12:41 - await a message dot channel dot send now
12:48 - we're not just gonna send in bed like
12:50 - you might think what we actually have to
12:52 - do is embed equals embed now that's it's
12:56 - kind of a weird thing as we named our
12:57 - variable embed but essentially this is
12:59 - just dictating what is gonna be embedded
13:02 - in the message now we also have to add
13:04 - this other one which is going to be
13:05 - content and this has to be equal to none
13:08 - because by default we're gonna be
13:10 - sending content so if we don't say
13:12 - anything
13:13 - it's gonna send like a blank message
13:14 - which I don't think you can do
13:16 - so anyways just add this content equals
13:18 - none and then embed equals in bed and if
13:20 - we stop and rerun our BOTS go to our
13:23 - discord server and we type exclamation
13:25 - point help let's see there we go so
13:29 - there we go so help on ball it says some
13:31 - useful commands greets the user prince
13:32 - number so users let's try hello here hi
13:35 - there we go so that is essentially all
13:38 - I'm gonna show you guys for the discord
13:41 - bots there is tons tons tons tons of
13:43 - things you can do go look through the
13:45 - documentation I will be honest it's not
13:47 - great and there's not that many examples
13:49 - on how to do stuff so it's kind of
13:50 - difficult to figure out but if you use
13:51 - you guys do find out how to join those
13:53 - voice channels and play music please let
13:56 - me know I'll like shout you guys out or
13:58 - whatever cuz I really want to know how
13:59 - to do that and I was having a lot of
14:00 - difficulties with it so what I
14:02 - appreciate that and other than that if
14:04 - you guys enjoyed the video please make
14:05 - sure you leave a like and subscribe and
14:07 - I may continue the series in the future
14:08 - but no promises on that
14:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to their discord rewrite tutorial so in today's video when I would be showing you is how to change member nicknames how to embed messages so they look like nicer how to check and check for like swear words or stuff like that and delete those messages and I think that's about it for this tutorial now I do apologize as I wanted to show you guys how to do voice chat stuff and I was messing with it and I can get in the voice chat and I can leave the voice chat that's all fine but whenever I try to actually play any audio in that chat I'm getting a lot of issues and I messed around with it for about two hours this morning and it seems that I need to install some kind of library that I can't figure out so until I get that unfortunately I can't show you guys I need the voice chat stuff but if any of you know how to do that voice chat stuff please don't hesitate to let me know on discord or whatever on my forum on tech with Tim net because I'd be happy to have a look at that and try to do a tutorial on that but right now this will probably be the last video in the series until maybe I decide to continue it on later on so anyways let's go ahead and get started and I think the first thing I'm gonna do is tell you how to change someone's nickname because that's probably a pretty useful thing and it's actually not as intuitive as it seems from reading the documentation so to do this what we're gonna do or like what I'm gonna do is if someone tries to change their nickname to Tim I am just gonna change it back to what it used to be or if they didn't have a nickname before I'm gonna like make their nickname like you can't do that or something okay so to do this we need to do another event so I'm going to add client events and then down here I believe it is a sync define and then on underscore member underscore updates I think that's it and then it takes two parameters which is before if I spelt that correctly and after like that so we have before and after and what these are gonna represent is the member so it gives you a member I'm not sure if you've been reading the documentation but if you have you'll know what that means before and then afterwards and the afterwards will obviously have all changed properties so for example like a new nickname a new rule etc so let me actually bring this up to show you okay that's something else I was looking at be out on member update so it takes before and after and these are the things that will trigger this function to run so if they change their status the game they're playing an avatar and nickname or the rule so we're just gonna deal with nickname but if you wanted to see like if they were changing what game they're playing or status this will trigger for that as well just you know so she I don't know why the Bloods running right now but that's okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna get the nickname that they tried to change to write or that they did change you so I'll say um I'll just say after actually I don't know if I could use a Nick will say n is equal to after dot Nick okay now this is gonna stand for the nickname they attempted to change Jude now if they didn't change their nickname this after is gonna be set to none or it's gonna be set to the nickname they already work so we will do here is will say if and and we'll just do that which means if it's anything and it's not none because if it's none this this won't trigger and we won't go into this if statement meaning we're not going to change the nickname to what it was before if that makes sense so essentially this could be a non value because it's gonna trigger for five different things so if they don't change their nickname this will be none okay makes sense so if n so now what we'll do is we'll say if and lower so lowercase equals equals Tim then we will change this and we can even go as far as to say if it contains Tim so m dot lower dot count and then here we'll put Tim is greater than zero so if they try to put Tim anywhere in their nickname we'll just change their nickname back to what it was before so in here now we got to check if they had a nickname before so we'll say glass doesn't like the last nickname it goes with four dot Nick okay and then if last will simply say that there we're gonna edit their nickname so it is their last nickname and otherwise we'll just change their nickname to like a set value okay so if last so if they did have a nickname let's change it back so the way we do that is we're gonna say after dot edit I think it started it let me look here dot edit yep and then we're gonna do Nick equals and then what their last nickname was which would be last okay now if the didn't have a nickname before this wouldn't work obviously right or it would make their nickname none which we don't want so what I'm gonna do now is let's say they didn't have one before they tried to change it to that well too bad for them I'm gonna change their nickname to no you can't do that so to do that we'll just go to Nick equals no stop that like that okay exclamation point I think that he's allowed a new nickname well maybe let's remove it in case okay anyways so we'll do that and that's now gonna work to change nicknames now the thing is with this bought and I'll run it quickly and I'm actually I'll show you my phone because I'm gonna test it it has tits oh I already was messing with stuff here it has to have a higher permission than the person you're trying to change nickname so right now I actually went ahead and added two bought permission to this and I just gave it the administrator but if I try to change like the system owner or the server owner which would be me my own nickname it won't work it'll say there's a permission error because the bot doesn't have as high purpose a permission as Tim does so we can't change that so what I have to do actually is go to server settings go to what is it roles and I just created a new bot our new role cold bot so you can just literally click plus a new role give it a name and just make it administrator okay and then just assign that role to your boss to do that you go here you go plus and then you just give it that role and then that way now it'll be able to change like at everyone so like any person lower than the server owners nickname I think that makes sense to you guys so let's actually I was gonna test that wasn't it so I have a new another discord account on my phone and I'm just gonna type something I'm gonna try to change my nickname so actually I'll type something first I'm on my phone right now so you guys can see so high and you can see my nickname right now is yes so now I'll just change my nickname in here by just going change nickname and I'll try to change it to like Tim one two three okay so I tried to do that and that works really what's our issue here edit Nick equals last remembered edit was never awaited okay so that's what we had to do after out of that so we actually just have to go in this code here and go await because this is something that like could take a second right so we'll say oh wait like that and now if we close the bought and try it again hopefully this well this will fix this for us so we'll go to discard here and now we'll just try to change the nickname one more time so you can see right now my name is Tim one two three and we might run into an issue here but we'll see so change nickname to Tim one two three four I click Save and now you went back okay so the reason running to an issue is because my nickname okay I'll show you guys in a second it already contains Tim so it has like an issue but let's just make it tea so now you can see it's tea on my screen I don't know why I just pointed as if you guys we're gonna see that but now we'll change it back so change nickname and we'll make it Tim okay ready so if I click it it goes Tim and then it goes right back to tea so it doesn't let me change that nickname now if I didn't have a nickname so I think I can remove it it'll just get rid of it so that's there's my name okay and now if I try to change it so change nickname to like Tim and save it now it just says no stop that because I didn't have a nickname before so it just renames it no stop that okay makes sense I think so alright it's okay so what are we doing now so we've got the nickname thing down you guys can play with this as probably isn't the best way to do this especially if you already had a name that contains a Tim in it then like you would give you some issues but anyways what we'll do now is we'll work with deleting messages so let's say there's a few messages or a few things that if they appear in a message we want to delete them so for example I'll just going to say bad underscore words equals two and I'll put a list of words here and some bad words let's just make one bad okay bad and like stop obviously you can make these swear words if you want but I'm just not gonna type them out bad stop let's say 45 is a bad word okay so if we want um habit so it automatically like moderates these words and doesn't let them show up in a message strain we'll just delete the message if they ever appear in any of the messages so the way to do that is we'll just make a for loop and we'll loop through all these words and check if the message that was sent contains these words so let's say forward in bad underscore words like this if what do you call it will say message got content or actually we're going to do if word is in message content I think that will actually work maybe we went after this message content count word I think the other one would work as well but I want to be safe so this message account outward is greater than zero which means one of these words appeared in our messages then what we will do is well just print to the console and we'll say like a bad word or sad just so we know and then we're gonna actually delete that message so the way we do that is say message dot channel dot courage I think let me have a look that might not be actually what is known is that dot purge and then we're gonna put limits equals and in this case I'm just gonna put one now if you want to delete like a ton of messages you could put I think the max is 125 that you can do for deleting the you guys can play with that this is how many messages up we're gonna delete so in this case since I just sent one message where's gonna delete that one I mean that should work fine let's test this out so I stop run go back to discord now I can actually use this account and what were some of those ones that were bad 45 oh and oh our BOTS is is it online what are we getting channel delimit purge runtime ah we need to await this again by bad awaits that stop run okay maybe let's see this it works this time let's go 45 and there we go it just instantly deletes our and this is a bad word was said if I type bad hello like what's in the same sentence again it removes outward so obviously you'd probably do that with like swear words or maybe just some words you don't want people to say but that shows you how you can do that pretty easily okay last thing that I was gonna show you what was that I don't remember let's have a look I was gonna show you oh how we can embed messages yes okay so actually I have an example here see how I have like this message it looks like pretty decent compared to just like having the bots send like a standard message well show you how we can do this and this is known as embedding so we it's actually pretty pretty useful and it makes it look like decent you guys can see here so the way we'll do that essentially is I want if someone types help or like exclamation point help I want to show them that nice output with all the different commands like easy to see with a little description so we can do that as well just say if message dot content built that correctly equals equals and that exclamation point help like that what we'll do is we'll start that embedding process so I'm gonna say embed is actually equal to discord dot embed like this now inside these brackets this takes a title which I'm going to say is equal to a help like that okay so like help on but we'll do that and it takes a description as well now the description I'll just say some useful commands why not okay so to show you what these ones are that would be this is the title and this is the description and these are what it's going to be known as I'm gonna have to look at it a what is it called here field a field okay field so these are fields and we can add as many of these as we want and you'll see if I go full screen here they show up like dynamically so they're preside each other and it's just like a nice looking kind of output so the way we do the fields is we just say embed dot add underscore field and then for the field it takes a name and a value say name equals and for this one we'll do the first command which will just say is what hello and then for the value we'll set that equal to greets the user okay now if we have another one so embed dot add underscore field that would be our other command right so we should do like next to my exploit users probably need an equal sign there as well and then for value we'll just say exactly what it's going to do so little description so prints number users like that okay so now I think to show this yeah to show this what we need to do is we need to await a message dot channel dot send now we're not just gonna send in bed like you might think what we actually have to do is embed equals embed now that's it's kind of a weird thing as we named our variable embed but essentially this is just dictating what is gonna be embedded in the message now we also have to add this other one which is going to be content and this has to be equal to none because by default we're gonna be sending content so if we don't say anything it's gonna send like a blank message which I don't think you can do so anyways just add this content equals none and then embed equals in bed and if we stop and rerun our BOTS go to our discord server and we type exclamation point help let's see there we go so there we go so help on ball it says some useful commands greets the user prince number so users let's try hello here hi there we go so that is essentially all I'm gonna show you guys for the discord bots there is tons tons tons tons of things you can do go look through the documentation I will be honest it's not great and there's not that many examples on how to do stuff so it's kind of difficult to figure out but if you use you guys do find out how to join those voice channels and play music please let me know I'll like shout you guys out or whatever cuz I really want to know how to do that and I was having a lot of difficulties with it so what I appreciate that and other than that if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I may continue the series in the future but no promises on that
