00:00 - many times in python you have a function
00:02 - something like this and the arguments
00:03 - for this function are stored in a list
00:05 - or in a dictionary now it can be quite
00:07 - annoying to have to call the function
00:08 - using the individual elements doing
00:10 - something like this so instead there is
00:13 - the syntax in python known as the splat
00:15 - operator or the unpack operator i'll
00:17 - show you that i can call the function
00:19 - func with star arcs now what this will
00:21 - do is actually unpack all of the items
00:23 - in my list into individual arguments and
00:26 - pass them to the function watch this
00:27 - when i run the code everything works
00:29 - fine now in the same way that you can do
00:31 - this on a list or on a string any
00:32 - iterable object if you have a dictionary
00:34 - so key value pairs you can simply make
00:36 - this two stars now i have to change the
00:38 - variable name here and this will pass
00:40 - keyword arguments so it will pass a
00:42 - equals one b equals three c equals four
00:45 - and d equals two hopefully you found
00:47 - this helpful if you did follow for more
