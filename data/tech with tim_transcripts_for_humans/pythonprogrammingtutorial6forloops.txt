00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:03 - this is the sixth video in my Python
00:05 - programming series and today we're going
00:07 - to be talking about four loops again if
00:10 - you miss the other videos in the series
00:11 - please go back and watch them first as
00:13 - it's going to be hard to understand if
00:15 - you haven't seen them already okay so
00:17 - let's get right into it today we're
00:18 - going to be talking about four loops and
00:21 - a loop is a new thing now if you're a
00:22 - beginner in Python and I'll talk about
00:24 - how they work we're going to start off
00:25 - by just writing one out getting right
00:28 - into it with these syntax so for X in
00:31 - range and then we're going to put a
00:34 - number which is going to be our starting
00:36 - position so in this case I'm going to
00:37 - put zero and then a stop point so ten
00:41 - okay and then we're simply going to
00:43 - print out X now I know we did this
00:46 - pretty quickly but let's talk about what
00:49 - this is and the syntax so a for loop is
00:53 - going to run a certain amount of times
00:56 - so in this case we're going to start at
00:58 - zero and we're going to go to ten
01:01 - this means the for loop is actually
01:03 - going to run ten times so what's going
01:07 - to happen is we are going to have our
01:09 - variable X which is right here and every
01:12 - time before loop runs X is going to be
01:14 - increased by one now we can increase it
01:18 - by more if we'd like to by adding
01:20 - another comma here but by default it is
01:22 - set to one like this I've just put it in
01:25 - so that you can visualize it so really
01:27 - we have something start a stop oops stop
01:32 - and an end
01:33 - start stop step sorry mother those put
01:37 - commas here to show you how it works so
01:39 - you can see we have our zero that's our
01:41 - starting number our stop which is ten in
01:44 - our step which is going to be one so I
01:47 - know you don't quite understand yet but
01:49 - you will after I show you a few examples
01:51 - so we have X is our variable which is
01:54 - going to be holding the number of what
01:57 - iteration we are through now iteration
01:59 - just means how many times we've already
02:02 - looped through this loop okay so let's
02:06 - do an example here all right so we have
02:08 - X and we've just started running this
02:11 - for loop now right now X is zero we're
02:13 - going
02:13 - print X we're going to print zero to the
02:15 - screen and then we're going to add 1 to
02:18 - X now this time we come to the loop we
02:21 - say well is X less than 10 yes it is so
02:24 - now we're going to print X X is 1 now
02:26 - we're adding 2 okay so now X is 2 is 2
02:31 - less than 10 yes 2 is less than 10 so
02:34 - let's print two okay and we keep going
02:36 - until eventually we print 9 then X has
02:40 - one added to it so it becomes 10 well 10
02:43 - is not less than 10 so we're not going
02:46 - to print out 10 all right I know I just
02:48 - talked a lot there but let's see it in
02:50 - action all right so just like I said we
02:55 - print out the numbers 0 through 9 now
02:58 - this may seem weird because I have the
03:01 - value 10 here so you'd say well why
03:03 - doesn't it prints out 10 it's because of
03:05 - the way the loop works so like I said
03:07 - really what's happening here is this
03:10 - plus equals 1 so pretty much this means
03:12 - we're just adding 1 to the variable X
03:15 - you can also write it like this x equals
03:18 - x plus 1 like that alright so we print
03:23 - out X and then we add 1 to X and we have
03:26 - to be less than 10 for this loop to run
03:28 - so on the 9th iteration we have well 9
03:31 - is equal to 9 plus 1 so X is equal to 9
03:33 - plus 1 we get the value 10 now again 10
03:36 - is not less than 10 so where you're not
03:38 - going to print out 10 yeah so that's
03:42 - pretty much how a for loop works it's
03:46 - pretty basic this is the syntax we have
03:49 - for and then a variable name so this
03:51 - doesn't have to be X we could use
03:53 - anything we'd like to use I could use
03:55 - hello I could use any other word it
03:59 - could be as long as the 1 assures a lot
04:00 - doesn't matter then we have the word in
04:03 - which is highlighted in orange and then
04:06 - range now the range
04:08 - takes a different amount of arguments
04:10 - pretty much an argument is whatever's
04:11 - inside this brackets so like at the
04:13 - beginning how I showed you we just did 0
04:15 - and 10 this means we have a start and we
04:18 - have a stop so we start at 0 and we go
04:22 - to 10 now I can also I can actually put
04:25 - 1 our
04:26 - in here like this 10 and that just means
04:29 - that we just have a sub so by default
04:31 - Python will say well we're just going to
04:33 - start at zero and we're going to step by
04:36 - one now I haven't showed you the step
04:37 - yet so we'll do that so again we're
04:40 - going to start at zero we're going to
04:41 - stop at 10 and we're going to step this
04:43 - time by two now what step is is how much
04:46 - we add to X every time so before I
04:48 - showed you had x equals x plus 1 in this
04:52 - case since this step is - it's going to
04:54 - be by 2 like that ok so let's go ahead
04:58 - let's run this we have 0 2 4 6 8 and you
05:04 - notice how we again do not print out 10
05:06 - because 10 is not less than 10 okay
05:10 - again we'll do another example with the
05:11 - step let's put 5 in this time now you
05:14 - can guess what's going to happen 0 5 it
05:19 - actually only prints out two things
05:20 - because we start at zero so we print 0
05:23 - and then we add 5 we get 5 now 5 plus 5
05:26 - again is not less than 10 so we are not
05:28 - going to print out 10 okay so that is
05:31 - the tutorial on the for loop we're going
05:33 - to do another type of for loop where
05:35 - we're going to use something called
05:36 - lists a little bit later on but right
05:39 - now we're just using this one this is
05:41 - the basic one I encourage you to play
05:43 - around with it yourself and yeah so if
05:47 - you like the video please go ahead and
05:49 - like it and subscribe and I will see you
05:51 - again for another video thanks good bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to another video this is the sixth video in my Python programming series and today we're going to be talking about four loops again if you miss the other videos in the series please go back and watch them first as it's going to be hard to understand if you haven't seen them already okay so let's get right into it today we're going to be talking about four loops and a loop is a new thing now if you're a beginner in Python and I'll talk about how they work we're going to start off by just writing one out getting right into it with these syntax so for X in range and then we're going to put a number which is going to be our starting position so in this case I'm going to put zero and then a stop point so ten okay and then we're simply going to print out X now I know we did this pretty quickly but let's talk about what this is and the syntax so a for loop is going to run a certain amount of times so in this case we're going to start at zero and we're going to go to ten this means the for loop is actually going to run ten times so what's going to happen is we are going to have our variable X which is right here and every time before loop runs X is going to be increased by one now we can increase it by more if we'd like to by adding another comma here but by default it is set to one like this I've just put it in so that you can visualize it so really we have something start a stop oops stop and an end start stop step sorry mother those put commas here to show you how it works so you can see we have our zero that's our starting number our stop which is ten in our step which is going to be one so I know you don't quite understand yet but you will after I show you a few examples so we have X is our variable which is going to be holding the number of what iteration we are through now iteration just means how many times we've already looped through this loop okay so let's do an example here all right so we have X and we've just started running this for loop now right now X is zero we're going print X we're going to print zero to the screen and then we're going to add 1 to X now this time we come to the loop we say well is X less than 10 yes it is so now we're going to print X X is 1 now we're adding 2 okay so now X is 2 is 2 less than 10 yes 2 is less than 10 so let's print two okay and we keep going until eventually we print 9 then X has one added to it so it becomes 10 well 10 is not less than 10 so we're not going to print out 10 all right I know I just talked a lot there but let's see it in action all right so just like I said we print out the numbers 0 through 9 now this may seem weird because I have the value 10 here so you'd say well why doesn't it prints out 10 it's because of the way the loop works so like I said really what's happening here is this plus equals 1 so pretty much this means we're just adding 1 to the variable X you can also write it like this x equals x plus 1 like that alright so we print out X and then we add 1 to X and we have to be less than 10 for this loop to run so on the 9th iteration we have well 9 is equal to 9 plus 1 so X is equal to 9 plus 1 we get the value 10 now again 10 is not less than 10 so where you're not going to print out 10 yeah so that's pretty much how a for loop works it's pretty basic this is the syntax we have for and then a variable name so this doesn't have to be X we could use anything we'd like to use I could use hello I could use any other word it could be as long as the 1 assures a lot doesn't matter then we have the word in which is highlighted in orange and then range now the range takes a different amount of arguments pretty much an argument is whatever's inside this brackets so like at the beginning how I showed you we just did 0 and 10 this means we have a start and we have a stop so we start at 0 and we go to 10 now I can also I can actually put 1 our in here like this 10 and that just means that we just have a sub so by default Python will say well we're just going to start at zero and we're going to step by one now I haven't showed you the step yet so we'll do that so again we're going to start at zero we're going to stop at 10 and we're going to step this time by two now what step is is how much we add to X every time so before I showed you had x equals x plus 1 in this case since this step is it's going to be by 2 like that ok so let's go ahead let's run this we have 0 2 4 6 8 and you notice how we again do not print out 10 because 10 is not less than 10 okay again we'll do another example with the step let's put 5 in this time now you can guess what's going to happen 0 5 it actually only prints out two things because we start at zero so we print 0 and then we add 5 we get 5 now 5 plus 5 again is not less than 10 so we are not going to print out 10 okay so that is the tutorial on the for loop we're going to do another type of for loop where we're going to use something called lists a little bit later on but right now we're just using this one this is the basic one I encourage you to play around with it yourself and yeah so if you like the video please go ahead and like it and subscribe and I will see you
