00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everyone and welcome to a brand
00:09 - new series on selenium in Python now for
00:12 - those of you that don't know what
00:13 - selenium is this is a framework that
00:15 - allows us to interact with HTML elements
00:17 - from any website so rather than just
00:19 - scraping information which we can do
00:21 - with selenium we can grab information
00:23 - from web pages we and also interact with
00:25 - it so we could in theory make things
00:27 - like BOTS we can have you know like an
00:30 - automated script that goes through and
00:31 - test different aspects of our website
00:33 - it's actually quite useful and it's
00:35 - pretty easy to get set up which we're
00:37 - gonna be doing in this video so some
00:39 - common examples of things you could do
00:40 - with selenium just basic movements is
00:42 - like drag-and-drop clicking a button
00:44 - filling in a form entering something in
00:46 - a search field grabbing data from some
00:49 - specific tags finding elements in the
00:51 - source code reading the entire page
00:53 - source code pretty much anything you
00:55 - want to do with a web page you can
00:56 - automate that with this Python selenium
00:59 - stuff the scripting which I'm going to
01:01 - be showing you which i think is pretty
01:02 - cool so we need to get into the setup
01:04 - here I will say first if you guys do
01:06 - appreciate this type of content consider
01:08 - becoming channel members by hitting the
01:09 - join button that you should be beside my
01:12 - channel name is a little promo there
01:13 - that tells you about what you get if you
01:15 - decide to become a channel member but I
01:17 - definitely do appreciate the support so
01:19 - with that being said let's get into the
01:20 - setup now the first thing we actually
01:22 - need to do is we need to install
01:24 - selenium so I'm gonna assume you have
01:26 - Python installed for those of you that
01:28 - are asking me this is a subline text
01:30 - window this is just a code editor it's a
01:33 - way that we can write Python code you
01:34 - don't have to use it you can use the
01:36 - standard ideally that I assume most of
01:38 - you probably have but what we need to do
01:40 - is make sure we have Python installed
01:42 - some version of that and then we need to
01:44 - get pip working which I'll talk about in
01:46 - a second install the selenium module and
01:48 - then install what I'm gonna call the
01:50 - Chrome web driver and I'll talk about
01:52 - that more when we get to it but the
01:54 - first step is to get pip working so pip
01:57 - stands for package installer Python and
01:59 - many of the popular Python modules are
02:01 - installed and kind of configured
02:03 - throughout that or through pip now pip
02:05 - is installed and comes by default with a
02:07 - Python installation so you do have pip
02:09 - on your computer sometimes it can be a
02:11 - little bit finicky though and not work
02:13 - earlier you can't access it so I'm gonna
02:14 - go through those mistakes quickly but
02:17 - first if you're on Windows open up a
02:19 - command prompt window if you're on Mac
02:21 - or Linux open up your terminal window
02:23 - and if you're on Windows so you're gonna
02:25 - type pip and hit enter if you're on
02:27 - Linux or Mac you're gonna type pip 3 and
02:30 - hit enter it may be PIP you might be
02:32 - pipe 3 try both of them if you're on Mac
02:34 - or Linux but the idea is that we
02:36 - hopefully want to get some output that
02:38 - looks something like this it doesn't
02:40 - have to be identical but something like
02:41 - usage pip command options you just don't
02:44 - want to get this error pip 3 is not
02:46 - recognized as an internal or external
02:47 - command so if one of these two work for
02:50 - you pip or pip 3 good pretty much ready
02:53 - to go if neither of them work on Mac
02:55 - Linux windows whatever then you're gonna
02:57 - need to configure pip and make sure that
02:59 - that's set up properly on your system
03:01 - now some of the common reasons for this
03:03 - it's not on the system path that's why
03:05 - you can't access it you do how PIP you
03:07 - just can't find where it is so I have a
03:09 - video called how to install PI game this
03:11 - teaches you how to fix pip all the
03:14 - common issues with it there will be a
03:15 - card and a link in the description click
03:17 - that make sure your pip is working and
03:19 - then come back here and start following
03:21 - along
03:21 - so once pip is working we have
03:23 - everything good all we're gonna do is in
03:25 - our terminal or command prompt window
03:26 - type pip install selenium in mind if I
03:31 - could spell this correctly so pip
03:32 - install selenium that if you're working
03:34 - in a virtual environment you're gonna
03:36 - have to make sure it's installed in that
03:37 - virtual environment I assume you guys
03:39 - know how to configure that if you are
03:40 - using a virtual environment but for most
03:42 - of us is just gonna be pip install
03:44 - selenium and assuming that works fine
03:46 - we're ready to go a selenium is
03:47 - installed now it's just time to get the
03:49 - webdriver so again make sure this works
03:52 - we can test if this is working by going
03:54 - into our Python window or python script
03:57 - and typing selenium so import selenium
04:00 - if we run that and we don't get any
04:02 - errors then we're good to go you know
04:04 - the program is fine if you do get an
04:06 - error then you got to make sure that you
04:07 - have this package installed in the right
04:09 - Python interpreter which is a common
04:12 - error that I can't really go over here
04:13 - because that's a whole video on its own
04:15 - but anyways once selenium is up and
04:17 - running I'm gonna assume you guys are at
04:18 - that stage now we're actually gonna have
04:20 - to go to this website which you can see
04:22 - I have here and it's gonna be in the
04:24 - description too
04:25 - the Chrome web driver so for this
04:27 - tutorial series I'm gonna be using
04:29 - Google Chrome as our main interface the
04:31 - thing we're gonna be working with I
04:32 - would highly recommend you follow along
04:34 - using Google Chrome so that's gonna mean
04:36 - download the Google Chrome browser if
04:38 - you don't have it and then come to this
04:41 - webpage which there'll be a link to in
04:43 - the description and we need to download
04:44 - the Chrome web driver associated with
04:47 - our google chrome installation so these
04:49 - are two different things the Chrome
04:51 - browser is different than the Chrome web
04:53 - driver you need both of them for this to
04:55 - work so first chrome second browser our
04:58 - driver sir so what we need to do is
05:01 - figure out what version of Google Chrome
05:03 - we're using and then download the
05:04 - appropriate web driver version so to
05:07 - find that out if you go to google chrome
05:09 - you can hit these little dots at the top
05:11 - right hand corner go to help and then
05:14 - about Google Chrome and it will show you
05:16 - right here if your chrome is up-to-date
05:18 - and what version it is you guys are most
05:21 - likely the same version as me but you
05:23 - may be a different version find that
05:25 - number and then download the correct
05:27 - version from this page so you can see
05:29 - that it says if you're using a t1
05:30 - download this so will download a t1 but
05:33 - if you're using an older version you can
05:35 - scroll down and they have the older
05:38 - versions here so 79 78 all of that it's
05:41 - probably worth it just to update to 81
05:43 - or 83 but it's not a huge deal so click
05:46 - that link and then you'll see that there
05:48 - is three or four files here and you're
05:51 - gonna download the one corresponding to
05:52 - your operating system so in this case
05:54 - we'll do win 32 so download that this is
05:57 - gonna be a zip folder I'm gonna put this
05:59 - in my downloads folder notice I already
06:01 - have that downloaded I shouldn't take
06:03 - very long and once we have that
06:05 - downloaded so you've moved past that
06:06 - stage you found the right version we
06:08 - need to extract that and place that in a
06:10 - specific location on our operating
06:12 - system so make sure you guys are
06:13 - following along here this is important
06:15 - this is hopefully save you if you
06:17 - headaches and some selenium errors
06:19 - extract this file so just double click
06:21 - into it if you're on Windows you know
06:22 - uncompress on Mac whatever it is you
06:24 - need to do and copy this file so I'm
06:27 - gonna do control C or actually control X
06:29 - cuz I'm just gonna cut it out of there
06:30 - but copy this file on your clipboard
06:32 - because we're about to move it to an
06:34 - easier location to access so I'm gonna
06:37 - go to local
06:39 - see drive here so local disk C Drive you
06:42 - can get that from going to this PC local
06:44 - disk C Drive if you have it there and
06:46 - all I'm gonna do is go into Program
06:48 - Files x86 and paste this file in in fact
06:51 - you can see I already have it here but
06:53 - for you guys that's where I would
06:54 - recommend you place this now what we're
06:56 - doing right now is picking the location
06:58 - that we want this file to live in so
07:00 - where we want chrome driver to sit so
07:02 - you can place this anywhere you want
07:03 - just make sure you know where you place
07:05 - it so that we can access that location
07:07 - because we're gonna have to reference
07:08 - the path to that file so the path to the
07:11 - file can be found by simply hitting the
07:14 - bar up here you just click on it and
07:16 - then copy what's here so in this case C
07:19 - Drive Program Files x86 I'm gonna copy
07:21 - that because that's where I place my
07:23 - chrome driver and now I'm gonna go on my
07:26 - Python file I'm going to say path equals
07:28 - this like that so the idea is take that
07:32 - Chrome file place it somewhere on your
07:35 - operating system find out the path to
07:37 - that file which you can find just by
07:38 - going up here or whatever directory the
07:40 - file is in copy that put it inside your
07:43 - Python file and now we're gonna add
07:45 - something to this which is the name of
07:47 - the file so chrome driver exe so the
07:50 - idea here is that we need the path to
07:52 - the file so that we can run it so make
07:54 - sure you get that correct and you put it
07:55 - in a location you can leave it in
07:57 - downloads if you want but typically I
07:58 - don't just cuz you accidentally delete
08:00 - things from downloads so anyways yes
08:02 - alright so now that we have that we're
08:04 - actually set up and we're pretty much
08:06 - ready to start kind of working with
08:07 - selenium and opening some things up I
08:09 - won't do anything too crazy here I'm not
08:11 - gonna explain a ton because that's gonna
08:12 - be mostly for the next video well the
08:15 - first thing we need to do if we want to
08:16 - actually open up a web page and start
08:18 - working with it is change our imports it
08:21 - from selenium imports webdriver now the
08:25 - webdriver is what is driving these
08:27 - actions it's what you know links up with
08:30 - the browser it's what's able to perform
08:32 - the actions so we need to pick what
08:34 - browser first of all we're gonna be
08:35 - using for selenium so the first thing
08:37 - we're gonna do is say driver and this is
08:39 - always the first step is equal to in
08:41 - this case webdriver dot and then you're
08:44 - gonna pick the browser you want to use
08:46 - so in this case I've been recommending
08:47 - chrome so we're gonna use Chrome with a
08:49 - capital C but notice you can use Firefox
08:51 - ie fan
08:52 - two chrome remote I don't know all these
08:54 - other browsers you can use as well so
08:57 - webdriver dot Crump now what we're gonna
08:59 - do in here is simply put the path
09:02 - variable that we defined above so we're
09:04 - going to say the web browser we want to
09:06 - use as chrome and the web driver that is
09:09 - for this browser is located at path
09:11 - which is here on our computer right so
09:14 - we do that there we go
09:16 - webdriver Chrome path and now what we
09:18 - can actually do is open up a web site
09:20 - so using driver we can say driver dot
09:23 - get and putting the name of any website
09:25 - you want I'm just gonna use my website
09:27 - I'm just to make sure I'm not doing
09:28 - anything illegal throughout these
09:30 - tutorials by running bots on websites
09:32 - we're gonna tech with Tim dotnet so
09:34 - drive it I'll get doc at Tech with Tim
09:36 - net we're gonna run that and notice wait
09:40 - a second data and then it loads up the
09:43 - web page like this and it says Chrome is
09:45 - being controlled by automated test
09:46 - software so that is how this works
09:49 - that's how we open up a web page that's
09:50 - how we get to what we want to do and
09:51 - I'll show you really quickly how we can
09:53 - interact with the web page just to give
09:55 - you a little bit more in this first
09:56 - video but that's the idea that's the
09:58 - setup
09:58 - get the driver downloaded get the pip
10:00 - package installed set up the path for
10:03 - that driver set up this driver and then
10:05 - we can access any web page we want so
10:08 - first thing if we want to close a web
10:09 - page what we can do is use driver duck
10:11 - close what this will do is close the
10:14 - current tab so that may not close the
10:17 - entire browser window it will just close
10:18 - the tab but if you want to quit the
10:20 - entire browser then you can do quit now
10:24 - obviously if you only have one tab maybe
10:26 - you run close it closes that tab it will
10:28 - close the browser but if you want to
10:30 - make sure you're closing the entire
10:31 - browser you can run quit so if I run
10:33 - this now let me give it a second you'll
10:35 - notice right as it gets to the web site
10:37 - it just goes ahead and quits because
10:39 - that's the next line right here now if
10:41 - we wanted to do something different like
10:43 - say we want to get the title of the web
10:44 - page what we can do is say driver dot
10:46 - title like that so we can actually print
10:48 - this out and this will tell us the title
10:50 - so what will pop up if I can find that
10:53 - here so see this tech with Tim Python
10:56 - and Java programming tutorials that's
10:58 - what it says that's get it's gonna show
10:59 - us that in the Python console so if I
11:01 - run this we look give it a second it's
11:04 - gonna quit
11:05 - and then it shows us the title Tech with
11:07 - Tim Python and Java programming
11:09 - tutorials Tech with Tim dotnet so we can
11:12 - go ahead and you know mess with that
11:13 - mess with a title we can check if things
11:15 - are in the title we can interact with
11:17 - specific elements and I'm gonna show you
11:19 - more and more but I think I'm gonna
11:20 - leave it here because we are hitting
11:21 - about the 11 minute mark and the next
11:23 - video will actually interact with this
11:25 - page I'll show you how we can type stuff
11:27 - in how we can hit enter on the page how
11:29 - we can navigate to different pages all
11:31 - that fun stuff and even more stuff to
11:32 - come in the future leave a comment if
11:34 - you guys enjoyed the video like the
11:36 - video of course subscribe to the channel
11:37 - and I will see you guys in another
11:38 - YouTube video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to a brand new series on selenium in Python now for those of you that don't know what selenium is this is a framework that allows us to interact with HTML elements from any website so rather than just scraping information which we can do with selenium we can grab information from web pages we and also interact with it so we could in theory make things like BOTS we can

video so some common examples of things you could do with selenium just basic movements is like draganddrop clicking a button filling in a form entering something in a search field grabbing data from some specific tags finding elements in the source code reading the entire page source code pretty much anything you want to do with a web page you can automate that with this Python selenium stuff the scripting which I'm going to be showing you which i think is pretty cool so we need to get into the setup here I will say first if you guys do appreciate this type of content consider becoming channel members by hitting the join button that you should be beside my channel name is a little promo there that tells you about what you get if you decide to become a channel member but I definitely do appreciate the support so with that being said let's get into the setup now the first thing we actually need to do is we need to install selenium so I'm gonna assume you have Python installed for those of you that are asking me this is a subline text window this is just a code editor it's a way that we can write Python code you don't have to use it you can use the standard ideally that I

browsers you can use as well so webdriver dot Crump now what we're gonna do in here is simply put the path variable that we defined above so we're going to say the web browser we want to use as chrome and the web driver that is for this browser is located at path which is here on our computer right so we do that there we go webdriver Chrome path and now what we can actually do is open up a web site so using driver we can say driver dot get and putting the name of any website you want I'm just gonna use my website I'm just to make sure I'm not doing anything illegal throughout these tutorials by running bots on websites we're gonna tech with Tim dotnet so drive it I'll get doc at Tech with Tim net we're gonna run that and notice wait a second data and then it loads up the web page like this and it says Chrome is being controlled by automated test software so that is how this works that's how we open up a web page that's how we get to what we want to do and I'll show you really quickly how we can interact with the web page just to give you a little bit more in this first video but that's the idea that's the setup get the driver downloaded get the pip package installed set up the path for that driver set up this driver and then we can access any web page we want so first thing if we want to close a web page what we can do is use driver duck close what this will do is close the current tab so that may not close the entire browser window it will just close the tab but if you want to quit the entire browser then you can do quit now obviously if you only have one tab maybe you run close it closes that tab it will close the browser but if you want to make sure you're closing the entire browser you can run quit so if I run this now let me give it a second you'll notice right as it gets to the web site it just goes ahead and quits because that's the next line right here now if we wanted to do something different like say we want to get the title of the web page what we can do is say driver dot title like that so we can actually print this out and this will tell us the title so what will pop up if I can find that here so see this tech with Tim Python and Java programming tutorials that's what it says that's get it's gonna show us that in the Python console so if I run this we look give it a second it's gonna quit and then it shows us the title Tech with Tim Python and Java programming tutorials Tech with Tim dotnet so we can go ahead and you know mess with that mess with a title we can check if things are in the title we can interact with specific elements and I'm gonna show you more and more but I think I'm gonna leave it here because we are hitting about the 11 minute mark and the next video will actually interact with this page I'll show you how we can type stuff in how we can hit enter on the page how we can navigate to different pages all that fun stuff and even more stuff to come in the future leave a comment if you guys enjoyed the video like the video of course subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in another YouTube video
