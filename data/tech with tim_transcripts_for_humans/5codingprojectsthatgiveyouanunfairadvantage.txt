00:00 - let's face it most software engineering
00:02 - resum√©s are the exact same same projects
00:05 - same skills and same qualifications now
00:08 - if you want to stand out you need to be
00:09 - different and one of the easiest ways to
00:11 - do that is to update your projects and
00:13 - work on things that are unique the best
00:16 - projects are easy to talk about in an
00:17 - interview solve some real world problem
00:20 - and are sufficiently challenging that's
00:22 - why in this video I've assembled five
00:24 - unique project ideas that are guaranteed
00:27 - to make you stand out and give you an
00:29 - unfair advantage now the way I created
00:31 - this list is so that no matter what type
00:32 - of role you're applying for at least one
00:34 - of these projects will stand out and
00:36 - look really really good so if the first
00:38 - few projects don't sound amazing to you
00:40 - just stick around I promise one of them
00:42 - will give you some really good
00:43 - inspiration now with that said the first
00:46 - project idea I have for you is an
00:47 - automated trading
00:49 - [Music]
00:50 - bot this means that you're going to ride
00:52 - some kind of Bot using some type of
00:54 - algorithm or technique that could trade
00:56 - cryptocurrency nfts or real assets on
00:59 - something like a Stock Exchange you also
01:01 - could use fake assets there's all kinds
01:02 - of apis you can utilize where you can
01:04 - kind of trade fake money now this is
01:06 - great because it stands out on a resume
01:09 - it's genuinely interesting and it's
01:10 - something you'll probably have a lot of
01:12 - fun building now these are the best type
01:14 - of projects one where you're actually
01:15 - doing a real world activity something
01:17 - that you're passionate about and that's
01:19 - interesting and you want to talk about
01:20 - in an interview the nice thing here is
01:22 - that it doesn't actually have to work it
01:24 - could completely fail you could lose
01:26 - money and it would still be a really
01:28 - great story and something that someone
01:29 - is genuinely interested in if I looked
01:31 - at a resume and saw automated trading
01:33 - bot my first question would be how much
01:35 - money did you make or how much money did
01:37 - you lose so it's interesting either way
01:40 - and this shows that you know how to use
01:41 - apis you can build a real world
01:43 - application you know how to execute some
01:45 - kind of algorithm or technique so to
01:47 - follow instructions with code and you
01:49 - know how to host the bot in a way where
01:51 - it's responding to some kind of events
01:52 - or triggers and Performing some type of
01:55 - action that's project number one really
01:57 - great idea I highly recommend you give
01:59 - it a shot now if you do build a project
02:01 - like that you're going to want to be
02:02 - careful with your passwords security and
02:04 - credentials so you should definitely
02:06 - check out nordp pass the sponsor of this
02:08 - video nordp pass provides the ultimate
02:10 - password and credential management
02:12 - solution which is genuinely something
02:13 - I've been looking for for a very long
02:15 - time I don't know about you but I have
02:17 - all kinds of passwords accounts
02:19 - credentials credit cards Etc many of
02:21 - which I share with teammates and it's a
02:23 - constant struggle to keep them secure
02:25 - but to allow my teammates to access them
02:27 - quickly now with Nord pass you can store
02:29 - all all of your sensitive business or
02:31 - personal data in a single location and
02:33 - securely share them with other members
02:35 - of your team now if you don't believe me
02:36 - you can try three Monon free trial using
02:39 - my activation code techwithtim at the
02:41 - link nordp pass.com techwithtim which
02:44 - means you'll no longer need to respond
02:45 - to requests for shared credentials not
02:47 - to mention Nord pass autofills passwords
02:50 - credit card details and more saving you
02:52 - and your business time and ultimately
02:54 - money with additional features like
02:56 - password breach detection data activity
02:58 - logs pass password generators access
03:01 - controls and more Nord pass is the
03:03 - ultimate platform to not only keep you
03:05 - safe but to keep you moving quickly with
03:07 - over 80% of hacking incidents caused by
03:10 - stolen or reused login information and
03:12 - 81% of company data breaches being
03:14 - caused by week passwords you need to get
03:16 - your security under control now you can
03:19 - do that by trying a three-month free
03:21 - trial using my activation code Tech with
03:23 - Tim at nordp pass.com techwithtim from
03:26 - the link in the description moving on to
03:28 - project number two I have a sentiment
03:30 - analysis
03:33 - tool now this is a bit more generic but
03:35 - you can really make this project pretty
03:37 - Advanced and something that's really
03:39 - interesting and stands out on a resume
03:41 - to start what you would want to do is
03:42 - scrape something like tweets YouTube
03:44 - comments posts medium articles whatever
03:47 - it is that you want and you want to use
03:49 - natural language processing to analyze
03:51 - the text and determine the sentiment so
03:54 - positive negative very positive very
03:56 - negative you can go as granular as you
03:58 - want and then what you could do is
04:00 - actually track the trends over time for
04:02 - example you could track a specific
04:04 - person and you could see if their
04:05 - sentiment goes up or down over time
04:07 - based on specific events you could track
04:09 - an event you could track some keyword
04:11 - that's being searched on Google you can
04:13 - do all kinds of great stuff here and you
04:15 - could even set up the tool to track
04:17 - Dynamic types of data this is a really
04:19 - great project especially if you're
04:21 - someone who works a lot in Python you do
04:23 - any data science related stuff it's
04:24 - going to show that you understand how to
04:26 - work with large sets of data how to
04:28 - interact with ap I how to perform some
04:30 - manipulation or analysis on them and
04:33 - then how to report that in a
04:34 - userfriendly way you can make this
04:36 - project really graphical hosted on some
04:38 - kind of website and it would be
04:40 - something that you could just click a
04:41 - link and someone would immediately be
04:42 - able to see and understand exactly what
04:44 - you did now my next project idea is a
04:47 - blockchainbased voting
04:50 - system now this is interesting because
04:53 - this actually illustrates that you
04:54 - understand large scale system design and
04:57 - architecture because you're building
04:58 - something that's running on a
04:59 - decentralized network now obviously if
05:02 - you're a web 3 developer this is going
05:03 - to stand out more however it still looks
05:06 - really good even on a standard developer
05:07 - resume to illustrate that you understand
05:10 - not just web 2 but web 3 you're able to
05:12 - learn a new technology and that you
05:14 - understand a bit about system design
05:16 - security Dynamics blockchain networks I
05:18 - know for me that I actually learned
05:20 - quite a bit about coding and system
05:22 - design in general when I started working
05:24 - with web 3 Technologies and blockchain
05:26 - because there's a whole new world of
05:27 - things you need to consider first of all
05:29 - is security you need to write your code
05:31 - in a way such that no one can hack it no
05:33 - one can steal the Assets in the case of
05:35 - a voting system you want to make sure
05:37 - things like ties are going to be handled
05:39 - people can vote people cannot vote some
05:41 - people have a higher voting share than
05:42 - others so this would allow you to really
05:44 - talk about kind of your system knowledge
05:46 - how you designed it and it's going to be
05:48 - less about the coding and the
05:49 - implementation and more so your kind of
05:52 - highlevel architecture and design so I
05:54 - think for a more mid to senior level
05:56 - role this could be a great project to
05:58 - have on your resume and really touch on
06:00 - for those aspects of the job so the next
06:02 - project is personally my favorite and
06:05 - this is an online multiplayer
06:06 - [Music]
06:08 - game now a few quick examples of ones
06:10 - that I've built I did online chess I did
06:13 - online Pictionary I did an online rock
06:15 - paper scissors I did a battleship one
06:17 - and I did a Gario we actually like the
06:20 - famous game online where you have kind
06:21 - of the bubbles that are swallowing each
06:23 - other and that one I actually had about
06:25 - 20 people playing at the same time and
06:27 - that was super fun to see kind of all
06:29 - these kid I was teaching at a summer
06:30 - camp playing that game so first of all
06:32 - these are super fun I love an online
06:34 - multiplayer game a lot of people can use
06:36 - it you can show it to your friends and
06:37 - family and it's a real app that they'll
06:39 - have some value in but also it's very
06:42 - complicated and it shows that you have
06:43 - some pretty in-depth knowledge and are
06:45 - capable of building some pretty cool
06:47 - stuff for example if you build an online
06:49 - game you need to have a client and you
06:50 - need to have a server that also means
06:51 - you need to host the server so you're
06:53 - showing that you have some Cloud
06:54 - deployment skills you understand client
06:57 - server you understand backend
06:58 - development and a bit of front end
06:59 - development and game design you
07:01 - understand networking you understand
07:03 - security and how to make things scalable
07:05 - and if you start thinking about how do I
07:06 - put something online it really forces
07:08 - you to do quite a bit of design
07:10 - decisions right you have to come up with
07:12 - some architecture you have to figure out
07:13 - what's going to be done by the server
07:14 - what's going to be done by the client
07:16 - what kind of machine do I need how do I
07:18 - make this more scalable should I have
07:19 - multiple servers there's a lot of
07:21 - different considerations and it's a
07:22 - great thing to talk about an interview
07:24 - that I think is quite impressive and
07:26 - really makes you stand out highly
07:28 - recommend giving this one a shot now
07:29 - let's move on to my final project now my
07:32 - last project idea is a computer vision
07:35 - related
07:36 - [Music]
07:37 - application I'm going to give you one or
07:39 - two examples that I would do in terms of
07:41 - computer vision but you can come up with
07:43 - kind of whatever you want so the first
07:44 - one that I love and that I've personally
07:46 - built is a face detection system for a
07:48 - Raspberry Pi security system now this
07:51 - was really cool because I actually put
07:53 - this in my house had a little Raspberry
07:54 - Pi that I set up kind of at my door this
07:56 - when I was living with my parents and
07:58 - had a camera on it and when someone came
08:00 - up to the door it would identify who
08:02 - they were based on a face detection
08:04 - script and it would just notify me with
08:05 - like a little microphone like you know X
08:08 - is at the door y is at the door whatever
08:10 - the name of the people so that one was
08:12 - super cool use computer vision use the
08:14 - hardware sensor wasn't even that
08:16 - complicated to set up it was a really
08:18 - cool project that I could talk about in
08:20 - an interview and another one that I've
08:22 - set up is actually a cat tracker so at
08:24 - one point in time I had two cats they
08:26 - looked very similar but one cat would
08:28 - always steal the food of the other cat
08:29 - so what I did is I set up a camera close
08:32 - to where the food actually was so I
08:34 - could track which cat was eating at
08:36 - which time and it would kind of notify
08:38 - me if one of the cats was stealing the
08:39 - other cat's food so an example of a real
08:42 - world application that used computer
08:44 - vision that actually did detection of in
08:46 - this case animals previously it was
08:48 - people they're not that difficult to
08:50 - build but they're really interesting
08:52 - they look great on a resumate the real
08:54 - world and something you're going to have
08:55 - fun building so I recommend if you can
08:57 - and if you have that kind of hardw where
08:59 - do some type of computer vision type
09:01 - task it could be solving a Rubik's Cube
09:04 - with computer vision that means you're
09:05 - also going to interact with some
09:06 - robotics components as well could be
09:08 - analyzing your backyard and seeing which
09:10 - Stray Cats hang out on your deck that
09:12 - happens to me all the time a lot of
09:14 - really cool applications here they're
09:16 - also quite visual so if you're able to
09:18 - present this to someone or show it to
09:19 - them they can see right away exactly
09:21 - what you built overall those are my five
09:24 - project ideas I think these are super
09:26 - fun unique and interesting and they're
09:28 - definitely going to make you stand out
09:29 - and give you an unfair
09:32 - [Music]
09:38 - advantage

Cleaned transcript:

let's face it most software engineering resum√©s are the exact same same projects same skills and same qualifications now if you want to stand out you need to be different and one of the easiest ways to do that is to update your projects and work on things that are unique the best projects are easy to talk about in an interview solve some real world problem and are sufficiently challenging that's why in this video I've assembled five unique project ideas that are guaranteed to make you stand out and give you an unfair advantage now the way I created this list is so that no matter what type of role you're applying for at least one of these projects will stand out and look really really good so if the first few projects don't sound amazing to you just stick around I promise one of them will give you some really good inspiration now with that said the first project idea I have for you is an automated trading bot this means that you're going to ride some kind of Bot using some type of algorithm or technique that could trade cryptocurrency nfts or real assets on something like a Stock Exchange you also could use fake assets there's all kinds of apis you can utilize where you can kind of trade fake money now this is great because it stands out on a resume it's genuinely interesting and it's something you'll probably have a lot of fun building now these are the best type of projects one where you're actually doing a real world activity something that you're passionate about and that's interesting and you want to talk about in an interview the nice thing here is that it doesn't actually have to work it could completely fail you could lose money and it would still be a really great story and something that someone is genuinely interested in if I looked at a resume and saw automated trading bot my first question would be how much money did you make or how much money did you lose so it's interesting either way and this shows that you know how to use apis you can build a real world application you know how to execute some kind of algorithm or technique so to follow instructions with code and you know how to host the bot in a way where it's responding to some kind of events or triggers and Performing some type of action that's project number one really great idea I highly recommend you give it a shot now if you do build a project like that you're going to want to be careful with your passwords security and credentials so you should definitely check out nordp pass the sponsor of this video nordp pass provides the ultimate password and credential management solution which is genuinely something I've been looking for for a very long time I don't know about you but I have all kinds of passwords accounts credentials credit cards Etc many of which I share with teammates and it's a constant struggle to keep them secure but to allow my teammates to access them quickly now with Nord pass you can store all all of your sensitive business or personal

you need to get your security under control now you can do that by trying a threemonth free trial using my activation code Tech with Tim at nordp pass.com techwithtim from the link in the description moving on to project number two I have a sentiment analysis tool now this is a bit more generic but you can really make this project pretty Advanced and something that's really interesting and stands

would immediately be able to see and understand exactly what you did now my next project idea is a blockchainbased voting system now this is interesting because this actually illustrates that you understand large scale system design and architecture because you're building something that's running on a decentralized network now obviously if you're a web 3 developer this is going to stand out more however it still looks really good even on a standard developer resume to illustrate that you understand not just web 2 but web 3 you're able to learn a new technology and that you understand a
