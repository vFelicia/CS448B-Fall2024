00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the
00:01 - fourth video in the ordering a pizza
00:03 - with Python series now what we're gonna
00:05 - be doing in this video is just wrapping
00:07 - up kind of showing the items that are on
00:08 - someone's border I'm gonna show you how
00:10 - we can remove items from the order
00:12 - although I'm not really gonna implement
00:13 - like a script that does that for us
00:15 - we're actually gonna some how much all
00:17 - of the items that we've decide to order
00:19 - cost and then we're going to display
00:21 - that to the user and then ask them for
00:23 - their credit card information so they
00:24 - can insert that and pay and place their
00:26 - order so hopefully we'll wrap up
00:28 - everything in this video that we might
00:29 - extend into another one depending on how
00:31 - long this takes and as always a reminder
00:33 - and thank you to our sponsor kite for
00:36 - sponsoring this tutorial series they're
00:37 - the ones that are providing all these
00:39 - awesome auto completions you can see
00:40 - like even when I'm just typing print it
00:42 - gives me the completions from kites when
00:44 - I've been using some different things in
00:45 - the API it's been giving me a lot of
00:48 - useful suggestions for all the different
00:50 - methods so for example these methods are
00:51 - not built into a library like they're
00:53 - just from the IB the API Pizza API and
00:56 - kite is giving us those completions so
00:58 - anyways you can download that for free
00:59 - and a link in the description alright so
01:01 - let's get started now what I want to do
01:03 - is display not only what the code of a
01:06 - specific item is but I'd like to show
01:08 - the name of that item as well as how
01:10 - much that item costs so to do that what
01:12 - we need to do is look at all the
01:14 - information we have about a specific
01:15 - item so I kind of whiz through this in
01:17 - the last video but essentially what
01:18 - we've done here is we said for item in
01:20 - order dot data products now products
01:23 - stores all of the specific items that
01:25 - we've added into our order and all of
01:27 - those items have some information
01:29 - associated with them
01:30 - like for example a code so let's just
01:32 - print out the item which we actually
01:34 - ended up doing in the previous one so
01:35 - let's clear that and have a look at what
01:38 - this is so let's look for an item so
01:41 - let's look for just I don't know
01:42 - Pepsi like that there's no results for
01:45 - Pepsi okay so let's add something else
01:47 - so let's say yes let's look for a pizza
01:50 - what we want um I like this one so we'll
01:53 - take that can I paste that in here no I
01:55 - cannot so I'll just type in 112 T s I X
02:02 - enter nope that's all we need and we can
02:05 - see this is all the information we have
02:07 - about our item so quantity one price
02:10 - 1974 we're
02:12 - is the price there's just like all this
02:14 - information that we have associated with
02:15 - this we have the name so twelve inch
02:18 - thin six cheese pizza we have what else
02:22 - flavor code product code code price so
02:26 - we're gonna use the price tag as well as
02:29 - the name tag to display this item in a
02:31 - list for us so what I'm gonna do is
02:34 - simply do item name plus and in this
02:39 - case I'm gonna do a space a dollar sign
02:42 - like that and then plus item price and
02:47 - make sure that we have a capital P on
02:49 - our price and a capital n on our name so
02:51 - doing this should actually print out the
02:53 - items name and then the price but I also
02:56 - want to collect all these prices and add
02:58 - them together so what I'm gonna do is
02:59 - take this I'm gonna say price equals
03:03 - that will do stupid loss price in here
03:06 - and now what I'm gonna do is say total
03:09 - equals zero so this is gonna stand for
03:11 - order total and I'm gonna say total plus
03:14 - equals and in this case we're just gonna
03:17 - say float price like that so now we
03:21 - should be collecting the total in this
03:23 - total variable and at the end once we've
03:25 - listed all of our items we can say your
03:27 - or your order total so your if I could
03:31 - type correctly here border total is
03:33 - Poland Plus and in this case we'll just
03:36 - do string total like that and we
03:40 - actually might want to add a dollar sign
03:43 - like so okay so this should tell us how
03:46 - much our order total is and then after
03:48 - this we can ask for the credit card
03:49 - information which is what we'll do next
03:51 - so let's run this python tutorial dot pi
03:54 - you're now searching the menu look for
03:56 - an item let's just go for you know
03:58 - sprite like that so please type the code
04:02 - to the items you'd like to order press
04:03 - ENTER to stop ordering okay so let's
04:05 - just get a 500 milliliter sprite so 500
04:08 - sprite like that and stop now let's
04:12 - actually look for another item so let's
04:13 - get some kind of pizza so what's an easy
04:16 - one to type we have 10s cc-can okay so
04:20 - 10 SC can I think that was right let's
04:24 - see SC
04:26 - and okay and then we'll say no we don't
04:29 - want anything more so these are two
04:30 - items we have a 500 milliliters sprite
04:32 - which is 177 a 10-inch hand to US
04:35 - Canadian pizza which is $13.99 and our
04:37 - order total is 15 dollars and 76 cents
04:40 - awesome so let's actually just separate
04:42 - the order total so it goes it down one
04:44 - line for us a little bit easier to read
04:46 - and now we need to talk about tax so tax
04:49 - is interesting because this is gonna
04:51 - depend really on what state you live in
04:53 - or what province or even what country
04:55 - you live in
04:55 - so I don't really know a way to get the
04:57 - tax rate from the API so what I'm gonna
05:00 - recommend to you guys if you care to
05:01 - actually implement tax into this and I
05:03 - might just even do a little plus sign
05:04 - and say plus tax so that people know
05:07 - that you know that is you know you need
05:09 - tax on top of that actually will do plus
05:12 - tax like that you could hard code some
05:15 - like tax variable up here and you can
05:17 - say like tax rates equals and in Canada
05:20 - for me where I live it's one point one
05:22 - three so 13% tax which is like very high
05:25 - but I know in some states it's like 7%
05:27 - so you do 1.07 and then you could just
05:29 - multiply whatever this number is so
05:32 - whatever this price number is by that
05:33 - tax rate and display that now that's up
05:36 - to you guys I just figured I mentioned
05:37 - that beeps in case anyone you know is
05:39 - gonna get mad at me in the comments for
05:40 - not including the tax okay so now that
05:42 - we've done that what we're gonna do is
05:44 - ask the user to insert their credit card
05:46 - information so they can actually place
05:48 - this order before we do that though I
05:50 - will show you that if you want to remove
05:51 - an item from your order you can use
05:53 - order dot remove item and then you can
05:55 - use just the code of that item and it
05:57 - will actually remove it for you so if
05:58 - you guys do want to implement that or
05:59 - create a more complicated program than
06:01 - what I'm showing you then you can do
06:03 - that because the point of this is not
06:04 - really to make like a fully functioning
06:06 - program it just to show you guys how to
06:07 - work with this and how we can actually
06:08 - use kind of some weird strange API
06:10 - switch this is okay so how are we gonna
06:13 - get the credit card information well
06:15 - fortunately for us I've actually written
06:17 - a kind of extension to this API called
06:21 - console dot pi you guys can have a read
06:23 - through it I documented it fairly well
06:24 - that actually has a method inside of
06:27 - here that will get a user's credit card
06:29 - information from the console so all we
06:32 - need to do is say card which is here is
06:35 - equal to and in this case it's going to
06:37 - be console input
06:39 - get underscore credit
06:42 - underscore card I believe that's correct
06:45 - we'll have a look here so get underscore
06:46 - credit underscore card and obviously
06:48 - since we're using console inputs what we
06:50 - need to do is import that from here
06:52 - so we'll say console input at the top
06:54 - like that and now we can actually use
06:56 - that to get the credit card and I'm
06:57 - going to show you what this does so
06:59 - inside of here this is what this method
07:01 - is that we're calling it asks for the
07:03 - payment information it says please enter
07:04 - your credit card information enter your
07:06 - credit card number expiry date security
07:08 - code zip postal code and then it
07:09 - actually checks to make sure this is a
07:11 - valid credit card before it returns it
07:14 - to us if we have an exception that what
07:17 - it does is simply calls this method
07:18 - again and keeps asking the user to
07:20 - insert their credit card so what we're
07:22 - gonna do now is say python tutorial dot
07:24 - pi we're gonna say you're looking on the
07:26 - menu okay so let's go for Coke let's go
07:28 - 500 Coke like this just because it's
07:31 - easy and then we'll say nope that's all
07:34 - we want okay so we can see your order is
07:36 - as follows 500 milliliter coke your
07:38 - order total is 177 plus tax payment
07:41 - information please enter your credit
07:42 - card information this information will
07:44 - not be saved so now we can insert a card
07:46 - number
07:47 - a expiry date three digit security code
07:49 - and zip slash postal code obviously this
07:51 - is an invalid card which had just told
07:53 - us so it's asking for the payment
07:54 - information again but once you insert
07:56 - valid payment information then you can
07:58 - actually pay and make the order so this
08:00 - is kind of the part of the tutorial
08:01 - series where like if you don't want a
08:03 - pizza to test this out just insert like
08:05 - some fake credit card numbers that are
08:07 - technically valid but aren't gonna have
08:09 - any you know numbers on them and then
08:11 - after this what we can do is actually
08:12 - place the order and see if we're gonna
08:15 - get a pizza now I'm gonna save that for
08:17 - the next video I think cuz I actually
08:18 - want to use this to order a pizza to my
08:20 - house and like make sure this works and
08:21 - show it to you guys but for now I think
08:23 - I might leave it at that
08:24 - so essentially what we've done is we've
08:26 - got the credit card information we have
08:29 - implemented kinda yeowwww this is what
08:30 - the tax is going to be for your order
08:32 - we've added up that we've looked at how
08:34 - we can use this console input and
08:36 - actually I'll add one more thing because
08:37 - we're not quite at ten minutes for this
08:38 - video yet we'll just extend it a little
08:40 - bit we can actually use this console
08:42 - input which I've created here to get
08:44 - some customer information when we're
08:46 - creating an order so for right now you
08:47 - see we've actually hard-coded the
08:49 - customer object up here so we've said
08:51 - you know this is all the information
08:53 - but we can actually do is simply use a
08:55 - method from console input which I'm
08:57 - gonna show you to do this we're gonna
08:59 - say console input dot get customer like
09:03 - this you can see we have get customer
09:05 - I'm actually gonna do get new customer
09:06 - and what this is gonna do and I'll show
09:08 - you because I've kind of programmed this
09:10 - slightly complex is ask the user to
09:12 - insert their information and then will
09:15 - actually save that information into a
09:16 - folder so that we can access it faster
09:19 - the next time we want to make an order
09:20 - so here we can say to start an order you
09:22 - must provide the following details
09:23 - country if you're ordering from Canada
09:25 - please type yes now so we type yes name
09:27 - please enter your name so it's Tim into
09:29 - your last name we'll do it tech insert
09:32 - your email address so we'll go Tim at
09:34 - Tech with Tim dotnet enter your phone
09:39 - number so we'll go nine oh five seven
09:40 - seven seven seven seven seven seven and
09:42 - then address we need to insert something
09:44 - here so I'm just gonna say forty Bay
09:46 - Street Toronto Ontario what was the
09:52 - postal code of this that's a good
09:55 - question I need to just look at the
09:56 - postal code here before I can insert
09:58 - this so that was whoops let's go over
10:02 - here so m5j x2 okay so let's paste that
10:06 - in there hit enter and then there we go
10:09 - it shows us the closest store so which
10:11 - is that asks us for the menu let's look
10:13 - for Coke we can add items to our order
10:16 - now so 500 coke no we don't want to add
10:19 - anything more assets for our payment
10:21 - information and there we go we've pretty
10:23 - much almost finished this program so
10:24 - anyways that has been it for this video
10:27 - you guys can mess around with this
10:28 - looking console input if you want to see
10:30 - what I've actually written here and kind
10:32 - of how this works and how these things
10:33 - are validated and with that being said
10:35 - if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave
10:36 - a like subscribe to the channel in the
10:38 - next video we will be ordering a pizza

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to the fourth video in the ordering a pizza with Python series now what we're gonna be doing in this video is just wrapping up kind of showing the items that are on someone's border I'm gonna show you how we can remove items from the order although I'm not really gonna implement like a script that does that for us we're actually gonna some how much all of the items that we've decide to order cost and then we're going to display that to the user and then ask them for their credit card information so they can insert that and pay and place their order so hopefully we'll wrap up everything in this video that we might extend into another one depending on how long this takes and as always a reminder and thank you to our sponsor kite for sponsoring this tutorial series they're the ones that are providing all these awesome auto completions you can see like even when I'm just typing print it gives me the completions from kites when I've been using some different things in the API it's been giving me a lot of useful suggestions for all the different methods so for example these methods are not built into a library like they're just from the IB the API Pizza API and kite is giving us those completions so anyways you can download that for free and a link in the description alright so let's get started now what I want to do is display not only what the code of a specific item is but I'd like to show the name of that item as well as how much that item costs so to do that what we need to do is look at all the information we have about a specific item so I kind of whiz through this in the last video but essentially what we've done here is we said for item in order dot data products now products stores all of the specific items that we've added into our order and all of those items have some information associated with them like for example a code so let's just print out the item which we actually ended up doing in the previous one so let's clear that and have a look at what this is so let's look for an item so let's look for just I don't know Pepsi like that there's no results for Pepsi okay so let's add something else so let's say yes let's look for a pizza what we want um I like this one so we'll take that can I paste that in here no I cannot so I'll just type in 112 T s I X enter nope that's all we need and we can see this is all the information we have about our item so quantity one price 1974 we're is the price there's just like all this information that we have associated with this we have the name so twelve inch thin six cheese pizza we have what else flavor code product code code price so we're gonna use the price tag as well as the name tag to display this item in a list for us so what I'm gonna do is simply do item name plus and in this case I'm gonna do a space a dollar sign like that and then plus item price and make sure that we have a capital P on our price and a capital n on our name so doing this should actually print out the items name and then the price but I also want to collect all these prices and add them together so what I'm gonna do is take this I'm gonna say price equals that will do stupid loss price in here and now what I'm gonna do is say total equals zero so this is gonna stand for order total and I'm gonna say total plus equals and in this case we're just gonna say float price like that so now we should be collecting the total in this total variable and at the end once we've listed all of our items we can say your or your order total so your if I could type correctly here border total is Poland Plus and in this case we'll just do string total like that and we actually might want to add a dollar sign like so okay so this should tell us how much our order total is and then after this we can ask for the credit card information which is what we'll do next so let's run this python tutorial dot pi you're now searching the menu look for an item let's just go for you know sprite like that so please type the code to the items you'd like to order press ENTER to stop ordering okay so let's just get a 500 milliliter sprite so 500 sprite like that and stop now let's actually look for another item so let's get some kind of pizza so what's an easy one to type we have 10s cccan okay so 10 SC can I think that was right let's see SC and okay and then we'll say no we don't want anything more so these are two items we have a 500 milliliters sprite which is 177 a 10inch hand to US Canadian pizza which is $13.99 and our order total is 15 dollars and 76 cents awesome so let's actually just separate the order total so it goes it down one line for us a little bit easier to read and now we need to talk about tax so tax is interesting because this is gonna depend really on what state you live in or what province or even what country you live in so I don't really know a way to get the tax rate from the API so what I'm gonna recommend to you guys if you care to actually implement tax into this and I might just even do a little plus sign and say plus tax so that people know that you know that is you know you need tax on top of that actually will do plus tax like that you could hard code some like tax variable up here and you can say like tax rates equals and in Canada for me where I live it's one point one three so 13% tax which is like very high but I know in some states it's like 7% so you do 1.07 and then you could just multiply whatever this number is so whatever this price number is by that tax rate and display that now that's up to you guys I just figured I mentioned that beeps in case anyone you know is gonna get mad at me in the comments for not including the tax okay so now that we've done that what we're gonna do is ask the user to insert their credit card information so they can actually place this order before we do that though I will show you that if you want to remove an item from your order you can use order dot

credit card number expiry date security code zip postal code and then it actually checks to make sure this is a valid credit card before it returns it to us if we have an exception that what it does is simply calls this method again and keeps asking the user to insert their credit card so what we're gonna do now is say python tutorial dot pi we're gonna say you're looking on the menu okay so let's go for Coke let's go 500 Coke like this just because it's easy and then we'll say nope that's all we want okay so we can see your order is as follows 500 milliliter coke your order total is 177 plus tax payment information please enter your credit card information this information will not be saved so now we can insert a card number a expiry date three digit security code and zip slash postal code obviously this is an invalid card which had just told us so it's asking for the payment information again but once you insert valid payment information then you can actually pay and make the order so this is kind of the part of the tutorial series where like if you don't want a pizza to test this out just insert like some fake credit card numbers that are technically valid but aren't gonna have any you know numbers on them and then after this what we can do is actually place the order and see if we're gonna get a pizza now I'm gonna save that for the next video I think cuz I actually want to use this to order a pizza to my house and like make sure this works and show it to you guys but for now I think I might leave it at that so essentially what we've done is we've got the credit card information we have implemented kinda yeowwww this is what the tax is going to be for your order we've added up that we've looked at how we can use this console input and actually I'll

a folder so that we can access it faster the next time we want to make an order so here we can say to start an order you must provide the following details country if you're ordering from Canada please type yes now so we type yes name please enter your name so it's Tim into your last name we'll do it tech insert your email address so we'll go Tim at Tech with Tim dotnet enter your phone number so we'll go nine oh five seven seven seven seven seven seven seven and then address we need to insert something here so I'm just gonna say forty Bay Street Toronto Ontario what was the postal code of this that's a good question I need to just look at the postal code here before I can insert this so that was whoops let's go over here so m5j x2 okay so let's paste that in there hit enter and then there we go it shows us the closest store so which is that asks us for the menu let's look for Coke we can add items to our order now so 500 coke no we don't want to add anything more assets for
