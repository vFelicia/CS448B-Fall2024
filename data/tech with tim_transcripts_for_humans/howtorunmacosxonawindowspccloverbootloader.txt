00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:05 - gonna be showing you something pretty
00:06 - cool and new that I've just done with my
00:09 - computer so if you guys have been
00:11 - subscribed for a while you know I have a
00:13 - custom PC that I built myself and pretty
00:17 - much I've been wanting to for the past
00:18 - little while to be able to run both Mac
00:21 - and Windows on that computer because I
00:23 - do have two old IMAX are having iMac and
00:26 - then a MacBook Air but they're both from
00:28 - like 2010 2013 respectively so they're
00:32 - not very good at video editing and
00:34 - they're fairly slow so I figured well I
00:36 - want a video edit using Mac or I want to
00:39 - use Mac for some reason
00:40 - why don't I just put it on my regular PC
00:43 - now I thought this is gonna be a lot
00:45 - easier than it was but now eventually
00:47 - after many hours of working towards
00:51 - trying to do this I've actually been
00:52 - able to load up a dual boot where I have
00:55 - both Windows and Mac on my computer so
00:58 - I'll show you here it looks like I'm in
01:00 - the Mac desktop and that's because I am
01:01 - right now this is actually running off
01:03 - of my regular PC so if I show you the
01:05 - specs here I can see this is not an
01:08 - ordinary uh Mac and it shows you that we
01:11 - have a 3.8 gigahertz Intel Core i5 8
01:14 - gigabytes of ddr4 and then in our X 480
01:17 - and I'm gonna show you these specs again
01:20 - in Windows just to show you that I am
01:23 - actually running this on the same
01:24 - computer now if I go over to storage
01:25 - here we can see I have Mac OS X we have
01:29 - untitled which is just my other my other
01:31 - drive that has windows on it and then I
01:33 - have my other two data drive so these
01:35 - just partion din the two different disks
01:37 - but this is the one that I store like
01:39 - videos on and stuff like that so you can
01:41 - see I do have my three drives memory it
01:44 - says that it's like this so I have my 2
01:47 - 4 gigabytes and then I have two empty
01:49 - slots which is correct and then you can
01:51 - see my two displays which aren't the the
01:54 - Mac display so it's got this wrong here
01:56 - it says I have a 4k at 21.5 inch display
01:59 - that's not correct the displays are
02:01 - these ones here and yeah so pretty much
02:05 - what I'm gonna do now is just show you
02:07 - guys me on Windows now how the dual boot
02:10 - works so when I load up my computer
02:13 - it first asked me do you want to boot
02:16 - from windows or do you want to boot from
02:17 - Mac do you want to boot off a recovery
02:19 - disk it asked me all the different boot
02:21 - options and then I select that every
02:22 - time so I'll show you a quick video it's
02:24 - just gonna be off my phone
02:25 - I know it's poor quality but that's all
02:27 - I have to record because I can't screen
02:28 - record the the BIOS in the computer so
02:30 - we'll roll into that now so you guys can
02:33 - see here that we have our clover
02:35 - bootloader now what this does pretty
02:38 - much is it allows me to either select if
02:40 - I want to run Windows or run Mac so you
02:42 - can see here it says boot Microsoft I've
02:44 - gone ahead and I've clicked that you can
02:46 - see we run through the BIOS and we
02:47 - should be at the Windows loading screen
02:50 - there we are so now we're at the Windows
02:52 - loading screen and you can see I can
02:53 - sign it to my account okay so now we are
02:56 - in my Windows desktop this may look
02:59 - slightly familiar to some of you guys
03:01 - have you been subscribed if you've seen
03:02 - some of my previous videos this is the
03:04 - one that I typically would use to record
03:06 - anyways here I have the specs brought up
03:10 - here just in control panel so you can
03:12 - see I have my Intel i5 three point seven
03:16 - nine gigahertz three point eight
03:17 - whatever eight gigabytes of RAM 64-bit
03:20 - OS on this case we're in running Windows
03:22 - 10 so I'll go ahead I'll close that you
03:24 - can see if we look over at MSI
03:26 - Afterburner here we can see my raid on
03:28 - our X 480 graphics card and the specs
03:32 - for that as well and then if I close
03:34 - that last but not least we can see my
03:36 - disk drives here so we have our SSD
03:38 - which is the 120 gig and then we have
03:40 - our 240 gig it is to be noted that if
03:43 - you want to do this on your own computer
03:45 - you can actually just partion your disk
03:47 - so that you have two separate versions
03:49 - one for mac one for Windows you don't
03:51 - have to actually buy two separate hard
03:54 - drives like I did although it does work
03:56 - slightly better if you do that and then
03:58 - I have my other drive which is my one
04:00 - terabyte actual hard drive so with the
04:02 - spinning disk in it that had that two
04:04 - par Shinzon it that we saw before so I
04:07 - am indeed running this Mac and Windows
04:10 - dual boot off of the same computer and
04:13 - right now as I stalk I'm just gonna load
04:15 - up a few photos and show you what my
04:17 - setup looks like just to show you I I
04:19 - don't have a Mac computer
04:21 - I'm just running the it off my Windows
04:24 - machine so the way that I was able
04:27 - to accomplish that and I'm sure this why
04:29 - a lot of you guys clicked on this video
04:30 - you're wondering how you can do the same
04:32 - thing it's very complex so it's called
04:35 - building a hackintosh so pretty much
04:37 - what a lot of people do is they want to
04:39 - run mac but they don't want to spend
04:41 - twenty five hundred three thousand
04:43 - dollars on a mac computer so they spend
04:45 - $1,000 $1,200 building a really good PC
04:48 - and then they just install mac on that
04:51 - computer now the thing is mac is really
04:53 - hardware dependent that means that it
04:55 - requires a certain graphics card certain
04:57 - processors and certain drivers so if you
05:00 - have an AMD processor for example you're
05:02 - not going to be able to run mac OS on
05:04 - your computer um that's like if you have
05:07 - some Nvidia cards they don't work and
05:09 - there's no drivers for them on Mac so
05:12 - fortunately for me I have an i-5 which
05:14 - is an Intel processor so any Intel based
05:16 - processor typically works and I have an
05:19 - AMD graphics cards and those typically
05:21 - work as well so other than that it
05:24 - doesn't really matter what type of hard
05:25 - drives you have power supply not that
05:27 - matters it's just really the graphics
05:29 - card and the processor also some
05:31 - motherboards have issues booting into
05:33 - Mac as it runs a different file system
05:35 - than Windows so I'm not sure what the
05:38 - two file systems are called but pretty
05:39 - much a Mac Drive can't be read on
05:42 - Windows and a Windows drive can't be
05:44 - read on Mac unless they're format
05:46 - formatted appropriately or there's
05:48 - third-party software that's able to do
05:49 - that so what'll happen if you don't
05:52 - install what's called a boot loader
05:54 - which is what I have that and you guys
05:57 - saw the video of that previously where
05:58 - it said do you want a boot from Windows
06:01 - UEFI or do you want a boot from Mac so
06:04 - on for Mac OS X then your motherboard
06:07 - won't let you boot on to the Mac OS
06:10 - operating system because it's not
06:12 - recognized in the in the motherboard
06:14 - there pretty well so there's a lot of
06:16 - steps that go into doing it it's really
06:18 - software related so once you have the
06:20 - hardware done you just have to make a
06:22 - live USB using a Mac computer so you
06:25 - already have to have a Mac for this to
06:27 - work once you have that USB then you
06:30 - have to install the bootloader onto it
06:32 - and then you have to boot from the
06:34 - bootloader onto the USB where you can
06:36 - then install Mac onto your hard drive
06:39 - once you have it on your hard drive you
06:41 - have to boot again from the USB and then
06:43 - install the bootloader onto that hard
06:45 - drive and it's just a whole bunch of
06:46 - steps but if you guys want to see how to
06:48 - do this a full tutorial it's probably
06:50 - gonna be like a 20 or 30 minute tutorial
06:52 - honestly if I do it um and make sure you
06:55 - leave a like on this video and leave a
06:56 - comment down below saying you want to
06:58 - see how this is done and I'll be sure to
07:00 - release a tutorial for you guys so
07:02 - that's been it for this video if you
07:04 - guys enjoyed please make sure you leave

07:08 - I will see you again in another video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you something pretty cool and new that I've just done with my computer so if you guys have been subscribed for a while you know I have a custom PC that I built myself and pretty much I've been wanting to for the past little while to be able to run both Mac and Windows on that computer because I do have two old IMAX are having iMac and then a MacBook Air but they're both from like 2010 2013 respectively so they're not very good at video editing and they're fairly slow so I figured well I want a video edit using Mac or I want to use Mac for some reason why don't I just put it on my regular PC now I thought this is gonna be a lot easier than it was but now eventually after many hours of working towards trying to do this I've actually been able to load up a dual boot where I have both Windows and Mac on my computer so I'll show you here it looks like I'm in the Mac desktop and that's because I am right now this is actually running off of my regular PC so if I show you the specs here I can see this is not an ordinary uh Mac and it shows you that we have a 3.8 gigahertz Intel Core i5 8 gigabytes of ddr4 and then in our X 480 and I'm gonna show you these specs again in Windows just to show you that I am actually running this on the same computer now if I go over to storage here we can see I have Mac OS X we have untitled which is just my other my other drive that has windows on it and then I have my other two data drive so these just partion din the two different disks but this

is correct and then you can see my two displays which aren't the the Mac display so it's got this wrong here it says I have a 4k at 21.5 inch display that's not correct the displays are these ones
