00:00 - often times in python you want to loop
00:01 - through multiple objects at the same
00:03 - time or combine objects together there's
00:05 - an easy way to do this and that is using
00:07 - the zip function the zip function looks
00:09 - like this zip now this takes any number
00:11 - of iterable objects strings lists tuples
00:14 - whatever and combines all the items
00:15 - together into tuples let me show you
00:17 - what i mean this will be names and ages
00:20 - now the zip function returns a zip
00:22 - object that is iterable so if you want
00:23 - this to be a list convert it into a list
00:26 - and notice i get all of my items
00:28 - combined together now of course we can
00:29 - combine multiple intervals so let's go
00:31 - with initials now and notice we get the
00:33 - initials as well great so now that we
00:35 - have that we can loop through this using
00:36 - a for loop so i could say four
00:38 - item in zed and then i could simply
00:41 - print out the item and you'll see that
00:43 - we get all of our items or i could get
00:45 - every single individual element so i
00:47 - could say for n
00:48 - a and i in z print
00:52 - n a and i standing for name age and
00:54 - initial and notice we get all of those
00:56 - values hopefully you found this helpful
00:58 - if you did follow for more
