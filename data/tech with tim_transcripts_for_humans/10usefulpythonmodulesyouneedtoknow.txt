With timestamps:

00:00 - the true power of python lies in its
00:02 - extensive libraries and modules that's
00:04 - why I've created this list of 10 python
00:06 - modules that you need to know if you
00:08 - really want to take advantage of the
00:10 - language now each of these modules has a
00:12 - different use case but I can guarantee
00:14 - you they're very useful and most of you
00:16 - will encounter almost all of them
00:17 - throughout your python career so with
00:19 - that said let's get into the first
00:21 - python module that you need to know the
00:23 - first module I have is the simplest and
00:25 - this is the request module now this is
00:27 - used to send HTTP requests so get
00:30 - request post request put patch delete
00:33 - you name it if you want to interact with
00:34 - some kind of web service or API you can
00:36 - use the request module now it takes just
00:39 - a few minutes to learn how to use this
00:41 - and it's very effective because
00:42 - regardless of what you do with python
00:44 - chances are you'll be interacting with
00:46 - some kind of API and you need to send a
00:48 - networker HTTP request so learn the
00:50 - request module well worth it and like I
00:52 - said just takes a few minutes the next
00:55 - module on my list is flask now flask is
00:58 - great for building lightweight web
00:59 - applic
01:00 - you can build full websites or apis now
01:03 - I find myself using flask all the time
01:05 - especially for hobby projects when I
01:07 - need to quickly spin up some kind of
01:08 - backend service I don't want to deal
01:10 - with a more complicated framework like d
01:12 - Jango flask is relatively fast it's very
01:15 - easy to get started with and again it's
01:17 - really good for building simple web
01:18 - services for example I built an
01:20 - application where I had a simple front
01:22 - end built in JavaScript and rather than
01:24 - doing something in no J ask or using
01:25 - something like Django or a more
01:27 - complicated language I simply use flask
01:29 - and set up a very basic back end that
01:31 - connected to a database to save the data
01:33 - from my front end I use flask all the
01:35 - time it's a great module to have under
01:37 - your belt and it's really good for
01:39 - prototyping hobby projects or something
01:41 - simple that you'll push into production
01:43 - it's not something I would use for a
01:44 - huge scale application but it's very
01:46 - flexible it has all kinds of plugins and
01:48 - extensions and although I typically use
01:50 - it for simple things you can build more
01:52 - complicated applications with flask due
01:54 - to its extensibility regardless learn
01:57 - flask I don't think you'll regret it now
01:59 - the next thing I think you should learn
02:00 - is actually not a python module but a
02:02 - free resource created by myself and a
02:04 - good friend of the channel HubSpot now
02:06 - this resource breaks down how to land a
02:08 - developer role in the world of AI and
02:11 - it's authored by me this is a summary of
02:13 - my over 10 years of experience as a
02:15 - developer where I discuss the best
02:17 - programming languages to learn and how
02:19 - to learn them effectively I also go
02:21 - through best practices for crafting your
02:23 - portfolio and resume and a list of
02:25 - YouTube channels and other resources to
02:27 - check out to level up your development
02:29 - skills I I put a link in the description
02:31 - where you can check it out completely
02:32 - for free now this is all centered around
02:34 - standing out in the world of AI and
02:36 - gives you key insights and tips that you
02:38 - can take advantage of to be competitive
02:40 - in this new market now a massive thank
02:42 - you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video
02:44 - and teaming up with me to create this
02:46 - resource check it out from the link in
02:48 - the description and now let's move on to
02:50 - the next module moving on we have pantic
02:53 - now this is a really powerful python
02:55 - module that provides data validation and
02:57 - settings management now this is
02:59 - typically used in collaboration with
03:01 - other python modules for example fast
03:03 - API uses this and even some modules like
03:05 - Lang chain take advantage of pantic
03:08 - types now what this allows you to do is
03:10 - have a more comprehensive python typeint
03:12 - system so that you can Safeguard
03:14 - yourself and make sure you have the
03:15 - correct input data it can do automatic
03:17 - data validation and it can handle
03:19 - settings management through things like
03:21 - environment variables pantic is a great
03:23 - module it has a lot of different
03:25 - features again most of this is related
03:27 - to making your python code safer and
03:29 - allows you to provide typeint so that
03:31 - people understand how to utilize your
03:33 - functions or the code that you're
03:34 - writing definitely check it out because
03:36 - you'll probably see it in a lot of other
03:38 - python modules that you might be using
03:40 - the next module on my list is fast API
03:43 - now this is pretty straightforward but
03:44 - if you want to create an API in Python I
03:46 - definitely recommend using fast API like
03:49 - I said it integrates with pantic it can
03:51 - do automatic data validation has a lot
03:53 - of built-in features and it's extremely
03:55 - extremely fast the reason for that is it
03:57 - has asynchronous programming built in
03:59 - into the framework and also provides
04:01 - automatic documentation for all of the
04:03 - different endpoints that you write if
04:05 - you're trying to get an API up quickly
04:07 - and you want it to be very performant
04:08 - definitely turn to fast API you can use
04:11 - flask as well but fast API is a little
04:13 - bit more professional it's something I
04:15 - would lean to more in production and
04:17 - because of the self-documenting feature
04:19 - of it it's really nice when other people
04:20 - are going to be testing or using your
04:22 - API it has a few other features as well
04:25 - but overall it comes with a lot of
04:26 - things in the Box you can also install
04:28 - plugins and extensions to get give it
04:29 - that much more capability regardless
04:31 - fast API should be on your list so
04:33 - definitely check it out next on my list
04:35 - I have D Jango now D Jango is really
04:38 - meant for when you're building a more
04:39 - professional serious web application I
04:42 - prefer using D Jango when I'm building
04:43 - out an entire website because of the
04:45 - number of features that come built in
04:47 - now it is a little bit more difficult to
04:48 - get set up with and to learn there is a
04:50 - lot of boiler play code that you need to
04:52 - go through when you're building
04:53 - something a bit larger and you want to
04:55 - have more organized code that fits a
04:57 - certain standard sorry Jango is
04:59 - definitely what to go with now it
05:01 - contains features like an OM this is an
05:03 - object relational mapping that allows
05:05 - you to have your database mapped to
05:07 - python objects that make it really easy
05:09 - to work with it also has authentication
05:11 - built in automatic routing and things
05:13 - like an admin panel which make it really
05:15 - nice for user management especially when
05:17 - you're just starting with your site I've
05:19 - built lots of very large websites with d
05:21 - Jango a lot of big companies have as
05:23 - well and it's definitely something you'd
05:24 - want to learn if you're looking to be a
05:25 - python web developer as a career or for
05:28 - some kind of developer role D Jango is
05:30 - constantly in demand and it's a great
05:32 - framework when you want to build a full
05:34 - website that's a little bit more
05:35 - professional than something you'd work
05:36 - with in flask or fast API moving on we
05:39 - have selenium now selenium is one of my
05:42 - favorite modules and that's because it
05:43 - performs web automation selenium allows
05:46 - you to control browsers like Firefox and
05:48 - chrome and to interact with various web
05:50 - pages like a human would do it now
05:52 - selenium is really good when you're
05:54 - trying to automate some task on the web
05:56 - it's actually really designed for web
05:58 - testing so doing end to end test testing
05:59 - of websites and seeing the website
06:01 - exactly like the user would but
06:03 - personally I use selenium a lot for
06:05 - doing web scraping so grabbing data from
06:07 - a more Dynamic website and I use it for
06:10 - creating bots so if there's some kind of
06:12 - task on a website that I need to
06:13 - automate maybe I want to do it every day
06:15 - or I need to do it hundreds of times and
06:16 - I don't want to do it manually I can
06:18 - write a simple selenium script that will
06:20 - go to the website interact with the page
06:22 - and do the tasks that I need I have all
06:24 - kinds of tutorials on this channel on
06:26 - how to use selenium so definitely check
06:28 - it out if web automation interests you
06:30 - now we get into numpy Now numpy is
06:32 - really the math module whenever you're
06:34 - going to be doing any serious math in
06:36 - Python you're going to be leaning on
06:37 - numpy that's because of its support for
06:39 - n-dimensional arrays and the performance
06:41 - it has over using traditional python
06:43 - objects almost all of your major
06:45 - scientific Computing or machine learning
06:47 - libraries have numpy as a dependency and
06:50 - even though you might not know it it's
06:51 - using numpy behind the scenes a lot of
06:54 - numpy functions are actually written in
06:55 - C or C++ it gives it a much higher
06:58 - performance than working with standard
07:00 - python types and it's just a module you
07:02 - use when you want to do a lot of math I
07:04 - can go on and on about numpy but overall
07:06 - if you're doing any kind of scientific
07:07 - Computing machine learning or you're
07:09 - doing a lot of math statistics anything
07:11 - mathy in Python you're going to be using
07:13 - numpy so you need to learn it now a
07:16 - close relative of numpy is pandas now
07:18 - pandas is typically used in combination
07:20 - with numpy or other libraries and it's
07:22 - used for data manipulation and Analysis
07:25 - pandas provides a data frame object that
07:27 - allows you to manipulate data easily and
07:29 - to do data validation and pre-processing
07:32 - or cleaning before something like data
07:34 - analysis or machine learning pandas is
07:37 - great because it provides all kinds of
07:38 - tools to read in data from different
07:40 - structures in memory or to put it back
07:42 - into those structures so going from in
07:44 - memory to real physical objects say like
07:46 - Json CSV text files whatever it might be
07:50 - pandas is great it's definitely
07:52 - something you need to know and again it
07:53 - will be used a lot in combination with
07:55 - various other libraries think a lot of
07:57 - your machine learning libraries data
07:59 - analysis scientific Computing a lot of
08:01 - them will lean on pandas as well as
08:03 - numpy moving on we have another very
08:05 - closely related module and this is map
08:08 - plot lip now this is really used for
08:10 - data visualization it's very
08:12 - customizable you can create bar charts
08:14 - line charts Scatter Plots you name it
08:16 - you can probably make it a map plot lib
08:18 - it can get very complicated and you can
08:20 - create some really great visualizations
08:22 - or you can do some really simple
08:23 - visualizations just to look at what a
08:25 - data set looks like really when you're
08:27 - doing data visualization in Python you
08:29 - on map plot lib it integrates with
08:31 - pandas and numpy and again very
08:34 - customizable and you can do some really
08:35 - cool stuff with it even if you don't
08:37 - become an expert I recommend learning a
08:39 - little bit about it it's very helpful
08:41 - especially if you're doing scientific
08:42 - Computing data science or any machine
08:44 - learning to quickly have a look at a
08:46 - data set before you actually start going
08:48 - and manipulating it or feeding it to a
08:50 - machine learning model and just a final
08:52 - thing here it's worth noting that you
08:53 - can actually create static interactive
08:55 - or animated plots so it has a lot of
08:57 - different features and it's not just a
08:59 - static image you can actually interact
09:01 - with the data set that you're
09:02 - visualizing so now we're moving on to
09:04 - the final module on my list but stick
09:06 - around because I do have one surprise
09:08 - bonus for all of you that made it to the
09:10 - end of the video now this module is
09:12 - tensorflow now this is the Deep learning
09:14 - module and this is what you're going to
09:15 - use if you want to create neural
09:17 - networks or Advanced machine learning or
09:19 - AI applications now tensorflow is great
09:21 - because it actually has a high level API
09:24 - called caras which makes it really easy
09:26 - to build models even if you're just
09:27 - starting out but it also gives you the
09:29 - full flexibility to really customize
09:31 - what you're doing and to scale what
09:33 - you're doing into production it's very
09:35 - good most people use it it's supported
09:37 - by Google it's actually an open- Source
09:39 - platform and tensorflow is something
09:41 - I've used a ton and had a lot of fun
09:42 - messing around with it if you want to do
09:44 - something like image recognition speech
09:46 - recognition something like a
09:47 - convolutional neural network tensorflow
09:49 - is the way to go there are a few other
09:51 - deep learning modules say like pytorch
09:53 - but usually I recommend tensorflow and
09:55 - that's the one I like the best so now we
09:57 - move on to my bonus module for all of
09:59 - you that's stuck around that's why you
10:00 - watch until the end of the video and
10:02 - this module is Lang chain now Lang chain
10:05 - is a relatively new module that acts as
10:07 - a way to more easily create complex AI
10:10 - applications or AI agents I have all
10:12 - kinds of tutorials on this channel where
10:14 - I utilize langlow and it's really cool
10:16 - what you're able to do using this module
10:19 - Lang chain is great because it provides
10:20 - a highlevel API that makes it really
10:23 - easy to interact with open-source models
10:25 - so think about things like GPT 4 things
10:28 - like llama 2 models you can use all of
10:30 - those from Lang chain and then you can
10:32 - add all kinds of different features that
10:33 - are really simplified by the Lang chain
10:35 - Library again I've got a bunch of
10:37 - tutorials definitely check it out
10:39 - something that I think is going to be on
10:40 - the rise over the next few years and I
10:42 - definitely recommend you look at so
10:43 - there you go that wraps up my 10 python
10:46 - modules that you need to know did I miss
10:48 - any let me know in the comments down
10:49 - below and I look forward to seeing you
10:51 - in another video
10:54 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

the true power of python lies in its extensive libraries and modules that's why I've created this list of 10 python modules that you need to know if you really want to take advantage of the language now each of these modules has a different use case but I can guarantee you they're very useful and most of you will encounter almost all of them throughout your python career so with that said let's get into the first python module that you need to know the first module I have is the simplest and this is the request module now this is used to send HTTP requests so get request post request put patch delete you name it if you want to interact with some kind of web service or API you can use the request module now it takes just a few minutes to learn how to use this and it's very effective because regardless of what you do with python chances are you'll be interacting with some kind of API and you need to send a networker HTTP request so learn the request module well worth it and like I said just takes a few minutes the next module on my list is flask now flask is great for building lightweight web applic you can build full websites or apis now I find myself using flask all the time especially for hobby projects when I need to quickly spin up some kind of backend service I don't want to deal with a more complicated framework like d Jango flask is relatively fast it's very easy to get started with and again it's really good for building simple web services for example I built an application where I had a simple front end built in JavaScript and rather than doing something in no J ask or using something like Django or a more complicated language I simply use flask and set up a very basic back end that connected to a database to save the data from my front end I use flask all the time it's a great module to have under your belt and it's really good for prototyping hobby projects or something simple that you'll push into production it's not something I would use for a huge scale application but it's very flexible it has all kinds of plugins and extensions and although I typically use it for simple things you can build more complicated applications with flask due to its extensibility regardless learn flask I don't think you'll regret it now the next thing I think you should learn is actually not a python module but a free resource created by myself and a good friend of the channel HubSpot now this resource breaks down how to land a developer role in the world of AI and it's authored by me this is a summary of my over 10 years of experience as a developer where I discuss the best programming languages to learn and how to learn them effectively I also go through best practices for crafting your portfolio and resume and a list of YouTube channels and other resources to check out to level up your development skills I I put a link in the description where you can check it out completely for free now this is all centered around standing out in the world of AI and gives you key insights and tips that you can take advantage of to be competitive in this new market now a massive thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video and teaming up with me to create this resource check it out from the link in the description and now let's move on to the next module moving on we have pantic now this is a really powerful python module that provides data validation and settings management now this is typically used in collaboration with other python modules for example fast API uses this and even some modules like Lang chain take advantage of pantic types now what this allows you to do is have a more comprehensive python typeint system so that you can Safeguard yourself and make sure you have the correct input data it can do automatic data validation and it can handle settings management through things like environment variables pantic is a great module it has a lot of different features again most of this is related to making your python code safer and allows you to provide typeint so that people understand how to utilize your functions or the code that you're writing definitely check it out because you'll probably see it in a lot of other python modules that you might be using the next module on my list is fast API now this is pretty straightforward but if you want to create an API in Python I definitely recommend using fast API like I said it integrates with pantic it can do automatic data validation has a lot of builtin features and it's extremely extremely fast the reason for that is it has asynchronous programming built in into the framework and also provides automatic documentation for all of the different endpoints that you write if you're trying to get an API up quickly and you want it to be very performant definitely turn to fast API you can use flask as well but fast API is a little bit more professional it's something I would lean to more in production and because of the selfdocumenting feature of it it's really nice when other people are going to be testing or using your API it has a few other features as well but overall it comes with a lot of things in the Box you can also install plugins and extensions to get give it that much more capability regardless fast API should be on your list so definitely check it out next on my list I have D Jango now D Jango is really meant for when you're building a more professional serious web application I prefer using D Jango when I'm building out an entire website because of the number of features that come built in now it is a little bit more difficult to get set up with and to learn there is a lot of boiler play code that you need to go through when you're building something a bit larger and you want to have more organized code that fits a certain standard sorry Jango is definitely what to go with now it contains features like an OM this is an object relational mapping that allows you to have your database mapped to python objects that make it

will lean on pandas as well as numpy moving on we have another very closely related module and this is map plot lip now this is really used for data visualization it's very customizable you can create

here it's worth noting that you can actually create static interactive or animated plots so it has a lot of different features and it's not just a static image you can actually interact with the data set that you're visualizing so now we're moving on to the final module on my list but stick around because I do have one surprise bonus for all of you that made it to the end of the video now this

that are really simplified by the Lang chain Library again I've got a bunch of tutorials definitely check it out something that I think is going to be on the rise over the next few years and I definitely recommend you look at so there you go that wraps up my 10 python modules that you need to know did I miss any let me know in the comments down below and I look forward to seeing you in another video
