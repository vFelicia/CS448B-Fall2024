00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - video in today's video I'm gonna be
00:04 - telling you about my favorite IDE for
00:06 - Python development and coding and I'm
00:09 - going over why this is my favorite and
00:11 - kind of showing you a quick glimpse of
00:13 - what this can do so pretty much an IDE
00:15 - is an integrated development environment
00:17 - and it's a little bit more advanced than
00:20 - a basic text editor as it has a lot of
00:22 - tools that can help you when coding and
00:24 - it saves you a lot of time it makes
00:26 - things a lot easier to organize and just
00:29 - to look at in general so a lot of you
00:31 - might notice that I typically code in
00:33 - the standard IDL e it looks something
00:35 - like this we have like a blank file
00:37 - there's nothing special there's no real
00:39 - tools like we have this format tool
00:41 - that's about it this IDE is way better
00:45 - it's called pycharm and I'm gonna be
00:48 - telling you why so the reason I haven't
00:49 - since now been using pycharm for a lot
00:52 - of my videos is because I wanted to test
00:54 - it out and make sure that it really was
00:56 - my favorite and it was good before I
00:57 - introduced it to you guys so I can say
00:59 - now after using it for a few months that
01:01 - I'm pretty comfortable with it and it's
01:03 - much much better than ideally the basic
01:07 - Python text editor so this is what's
01:09 - gonna look what its gonna look like when
01:10 - you download and open up high term for
01:13 - the first time so you can go to this
01:14 - download page which I'm gonna leave in
01:15 - the description down below and just
01:17 - download this community version it's
01:18 - completely free and it has all the
01:21 - features you're gonna need there's not
01:22 - much you need there's not much in the
01:24 - professional version that will really
01:25 - make it that much better experience this
01:28 - is more if you're working with a large
01:29 - team community works better for I don't
01:32 - know individuals so it's gonna look
01:34 - something like this
01:35 - you can either open a project or create
01:36 - a new project in this case I'm gonna
01:37 - open a project just a typical Python
01:39 - project um
01:41 - so pretty much I'm gonna just gonna go
01:43 - to desktop and just find one on here
01:45 - Python let's just open up machine
01:49 - learning for example okay so open up
01:51 - this one and you can see it starts
01:53 - loading us up into a project and already
01:55 - it's giving us tips on cool key bindings
01:58 - and things that we can use in
02:00 - pycharm so that's the name of this IDE
02:03 - and the way this works is it's project
02:05 - based so a project is just pretty much
02:07 - any folder and then if it has any Python
02:09 - files within it all of those are going
02:11 - to be to the same project so you can
02:13 - have multiple
02:13 - within a project and you can create your
02:16 - own projects you can open existing
02:17 - projects and they all have their own
02:19 - settings that you can save within them
02:21 - which makes it really useful so let's
02:22 - just go through kind of the ID Heat IDE
02:24 - here the basic stuff so there's a
02:26 - project tab this is what's gonna show
02:28 - you all of your basic basic files all
02:29 - the things that's in the working
02:30 - directory you have all your files up
02:33 - here so whenever I want to open a new
02:34 - file so and open
02:35 - what's one I don't have open neural
02:37 - networks I just double click on that
02:38 - I'll just open up in this tabbed view
02:40 - and then I can flip between all these
02:42 - files which already makes it really
02:44 - useful if you're working on multiple
02:45 - files or you want to copy and paste
02:46 - things you have to be moving them around
02:47 - your screen you can also split things
02:50 - horizontally and vertically so if I left
02:52 - click on this or right click on it and
02:53 - click split vertically you can see it
02:55 - shows up on the right here I can do the
02:56 - same thing with horizontally so it goes
02:58 - down or it's like that and yeah they
03:02 - also have this really cool structure tab
03:03 - which I just recently found out about
03:05 - actually I know I've been using it for a
03:07 - while but if you click structure it's
03:08 - actually gonna show you the entire
03:10 - structure of your code so I'll make this
03:12 - bigger and you can see that it goes
03:13 - through my class of this pixel class
03:15 - which I have open here and it shows me
03:17 - all of the methods that I have all of
03:19 - the variables the attributes and all of
03:22 - those cool things which is really useful
03:24 - so if you have a long or big files and
03:27 - you want to quickly find something for
03:28 - example I want to find my grade class I
03:30 - can just click on the grade class here
03:31 - on structure it'll bring me right to it
03:33 - and then it lists off again all the
03:36 - methods that I've made and some of the
03:39 - properties that this has so like Len
03:41 - pixels whatever you can go through that
03:43 - it also has variables and functions so
03:46 - guess like this is a function main is a
03:49 - function brings me to that and then
03:51 - these are just my global variables that
03:52 - I have defined and when I click it it
03:55 - brings me right to it so speaking of
03:57 - global variables there's a really cool
03:59 - thing that
04:00 - pycharm dozen it's called refactoring or
04:03 - refract during something like that
04:05 - excuse the thing but anyways if I could
04:07 - click on a variable so highlight it and
04:09 - I right click and I click refactor
04:11 - that's what it is refactor and then I
04:13 - click rename I can change this to for
04:15 - example with like that
04:17 - click refactor and now it actually
04:20 - changes all of the other variables so
04:22 - you saw how to W here it changes that to
04:24 - width changes this one to width same
04:26 - thing I can show you if ID
04:27 - with high tango refactor rename so
04:30 - changing h2 height like that it will
04:34 - change all of the variables within my
04:35 - file here that are named that same thing
04:37 - so this makes it a lot easier if you
04:39 - need to change a variable name which you
04:41 - will have to do a lot in Python to be
04:44 - able to do that okay so next thing I
04:46 - guess to show is just running the file
04:49 - so a lot of people when you download pie
04:50 - chart can confuse on how running files
04:52 - works so the way it works in PyCharm is
04:54 - your what do you call it your project
04:57 - has configurations and they're up here
04:59 - where this says draw number here yours
05:01 - would just say edit configurations or
05:02 - add new configuration to run your files
05:05 - this is a bit complicated but it's
05:07 - really useful once you learn how to do
05:08 - it you just click Edit configurations or
05:10 - add new and then up here in this top
05:12 - left hand corner you can click + select
05:16 - Python as your what your interpreter and
05:18 - then your gonna give a name to your
05:20 - configuration and this is what you're
05:21 - gonna select what is it when you want to
05:24 - run a certain file so you want to name
05:26 - it appropriately to the file you're
05:27 - gonna run for example in this project I
05:29 - have multiple Python files that I could
05:31 - run so if I want to around neural
05:33 - networks I would want to name this one
05:34 - neural oops networks like this so that I
05:39 - know which one I'm clicking to run so
05:41 - then you're gonna go do script path
05:43 - click this little folder icon here and
05:46 - you can simply just find that Python
05:48 - file and it you can run files from this
05:50 - configuration that aren't within the
05:51 - project which is really nice too so I'm
05:53 - gonna click neural networks and then I
05:55 - can also select my Python interpreter a
05:57 - lot of you are probably just gonna have
05:59 - a default like Python 3.7 but you can
06:01 - see that I actually have many different
06:04 - interpreters these because I have Conda
06:06 - interpreter as well so I'm just going to
06:08 - select Python 37 as my main one and then
06:11 - click apply and ok so now if I want to
06:15 - run neural networks I could simply click
06:16 - this run icon here and I'm actually just
06:19 - going to run main so I'll run main and
06:21 - you can see that it pops up a thing here
06:24 - just wait a second it's gonna open up a
06:26 - PI game window in one minute I believe
06:29 - and yeah so it's going through all this
06:31 - whatever and then I can click stop to
06:33 - stop the program at any time that I want
06:37 - so there's also a few things down here
06:39 - so we have run this is obviously what
06:41 - happens when I
06:42 - running your program and you can run
06:43 - multiple instances of programs at once
06:45 - so you can see if I ran a different file
06:48 - so if I run like draw number then
06:51 - another one will come up here and you
06:52 - can close out of them and delete them as
06:55 - you like there's a terminal and this is
06:57 - pretty much like your CMD so if you want
07:00 - to install packages or do stuff like
07:01 - that you can do that right from pycharm
07:03 - and there's a standard Python console so
07:06 - if I run this and I typed like I don't
07:09 - know x equals four and I'd type X it
07:12 - just works like a basic Python console
07:14 - which is really useful you don't have to
07:16 - leave this if you just want to test out
07:17 - what a certain command in Python is
07:19 - gonna do without actually running the
07:21 - whole program and going through all of
07:23 - that now this has really just been some
07:25 - of the basics of pycharm if you'd like
07:28 - me to do a full tutorial going through a
07:29 - lot of the different things that
07:30 - high-time can do then i'm more than
07:33 - happy to do that but i need you guys to
07:34 - let me know that in the comments down
07:36 - below anyways i highly recommend you
07:38 - guys download install pycharm the only
07:40 - downfall to it is it uses a bit more
07:42 - memory than ideally that being said it
07:44 - still doesn't use that much I think for
07:46 - me it uses maybe like seven hundred
07:48 - eight hundred megabytes of RAM which is
07:49 - not that much but it's a lot more than
07:52 - ideal he does anyways that has been it
07:54 - for this video go download PyCharm in
07:57 - the link below this will definitely save
07:59 - you a lot of time when programming and
08:01 - if you guys enjoyed the video please
08:02 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
08:04 - and I will see you again in another one
08:06 - [Music]

hey guys and welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be telling you about my favorite IDE for Python development and coding and I'm going over why this is my favorite and kind of

I'm gonna be telling you why so the reason I haven't since now been using pycharm for a lot of my videos is because I wanted to test it out and make sure that it really was my favorite and it was good before I introduced it to you guys so I can say now after using it for a few months that I'm pretty comfortable with it and it's much much better than ideally the basic Python text editor so this is what's gonna look what its gonna look like when you download and open up high term for the first time so you can go to this download page which I'm gonna leave in the description down below and just download this community version it's completely free and it has all the features you're gonna need there's not much you need there's not much in the professional version that will really make it that much better experience this is more if you're working with a large team community works better for I don't know individuals so it's gonna look something like this you can either open a project or create a new project in this case I'm gonna open a project just a typical Python project um so pretty much I'm gonna just gonna go to desktop and just find one on here Python let's just open up

the same project so you can have multiple within a project and you can create your own projects you can open existing projects and they all have their own settings that you can save within them which makes it really useful so let's just go through kind of the ID Heat IDE here the basic stuff so there's a project tab this is what's gonna show you all of your basic basic files all the things that's in the working directory you have all your files up here so whenever I want to open a new file so and open what's one I don't have open neural networks I just double click on that I'll just open up in this tabbed view and then I can flip between all these files which already makes it really useful if you're working on multiple files or you want to copy and paste things you have to be moving them around your screen you can also split things horizontally and vertically so if I left click on this or right click on it and click split vertically you can see it shows up on the right here I can do the same thing with horizontally so it goes down or it's like that and yeah they also have this really cool structure tab which I just recently found out about actually I know I've been using it for a
