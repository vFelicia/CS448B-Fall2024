19:29 - corner and communicate later thank you
19:31 - very much thank you an intelligent
19:34 - technology Wonder use it was doing with
19:38 - the v head minutes 41 seconds it's it's
19:41 - crazy like you can feel everything
19:43 - that's happening even when they play uh
19:45 - like on your phone with no additional
19:47 - sensors or anything it's just like a way
19:49 - better haptic than what you normally
19:51 - have so they were showing me like a
19:51 - video on the phone of an R8 and it was
19:54 - it felt like it was in the car quick
19:55 - question on social values ESG ele I just
19:59 - wanted to kind of quiet turn B more to
20:01 - that uh yeah that actually it's a very
20:04 - good question and that's what the work
20:05 - we are doing trying to doing now uh as
20:08 - we know some disabled uh people do not
20:10 - have the hearing ability or they can
20:14 - they couldn't see the scenes very
20:15 - clearly so talking kind of users haptic
20:19 - will be a very sens uh very uh very
20:23 - unique channel for them to know what the
20:26 - environment they are in and what uh some
20:29 - what's the things they are touching with
20:31 - so we can provide the environmental
20:33 - materials such as uh what is a metal
20:35 - what is a plastic and so on to uh let
20:38 - this kind of users to know uh whether
20:41 - they are safely or not so that's a a
20:43 - kind of use and we are doing this kind
20:45 - of products I don't know how they do
20:48 - that with the AI guys but it literally
20:49 - like I did the VR headset the controller
20:52 - the phone it to drive the haptics you
20:55 - have the chipset and you also have the
20:57 - AI to automate the various types of
21:00 - hatic interactions um of those what is
21:03 - your strategic advantage and this which
21:06 - of those Technologies are these
21:07 - companies most interested yeah that's
21:09 - really good question as we know uh the
21:11 - motor is a metal metal thing and the uh
21:15 - heptic is a sensory of about human self
21:17 - so what's the linkage between these two
21:19 - things that's a very good question and
21:22 - before that nobody knows the secret of
21:25 - them and we have uh my team has more
21:27 - than 20 years of haptic research so we
21:30 - totally know the receptors along uh
21:32 - beneath our skin and we also know the
21:34 - linkage between the motor and our haptic
21:37 - so uh uh just to answer your question
21:39 - that we know the secret of haptic itself
21:42 - thank
21:43 - you these guys are they already raised
21:46 - this series a by the way atic or data
21:48 - mode around the
21:50 - business yeah uh actually we just
21:53 - launched our SDK product in last year so
21:57 - as you can see we
22:01 - customers last year from the luxury
22:04 - regions and also we are trying to expand
22:07 - this kind of ability to the smart
22:09 - devices and other scenarios uh contains
22:13 - with the electricity
22:19 - vehicles thank you so much team for your
22:22 - fantastic
22:23 - presentation judges please score our
22:26 - first proposal and that haptic solution
22:30 - meet your friends in our audience you
22:32 - can also vote via the link we shared
22:34 - with you earlier on for media choice
22:37 - award thank
22:44 - you I think I muted the stream audio
22:46 - accidentally
22:51 - guys next up please welcome our second
22:54 - team Hawaii medical Technologies cor
22:57 - Limited from China and their proposal
23:00 - contactless Health monitoring technology
23:03 - so guys once we get a break I'll kind of
23:05 - tell you my rankings for these teams
23:07 - this one I'm a little biased cuz I
23:08 - actually used their demo and it was
23:10 - really really cool this one I don't know
23:12 - as much about I'm going to flip to my
23:13 - notes here let's see what we can find on
23:15 - contact here everyone is my great
23:18 - pleasure to be here to share some of our
23:21 - wonderful Technologies today and I'm
23:25 - from shinen Hawaii Medical techn
23:28 - and we F on the next generation of
23:31 - Health sensoring technology here we use
23:34 - the word sensoring because we develop
23:37 - the hardware of sensor as well as the
23:40 - software and algorithm of sensing
23:42 - technology
23:44 - and here we are new startup for about
23:48 - only two years and we did three things
23:51 - in these two years first we established
23:53 - a co- team from different background
23:57 - from financing to research engineering
23:59 - and operation and second we have
24:02 - finished our first generation technology
24:05 - and product development and applied
24:08 - several P patent and third we have
24:11 - cooperated with a lot of leading comp
24:14 - leading companies and Research Institute
24:17 - and University and Hospital in
24:20 - China and as we know there's a lot of
24:23 - people we should take care of every day
24:26 - for example the elderly people as we
24:29 - know uh it's about one3 of the ELD
24:33 - people have at least once for at home
24:36 - for at home yeah that's a big problem
24:39 - nobody knows and secondly is uh child we
24:44 - should take care of the child because as
24:47 - we know there are about more than
24:50 - .1% uh infant suffering from the
24:54 - suddenly death in North America and oh
24:57 - wow I know that fact there are some
24:58 - parameters such as the bra stre the C
25:02 - cardiac parameters and maybe the
25:04 - movement can show the abnormity in
25:07 - advance IND there no way to detect that
25:10 - and for another example the clinical
25:13 - clinical and postclinical
25:15 - patients they should monitor their
25:18 - health condition day by day time by time
25:21 - but so far there is no suitable method
25:24 - for example the medical devices too
25:26 - complex and the
25:28 - variable is not comfort and the
25:32 - compliance you're not going to get have
25:34 - variable there and we have provided a
25:37 - solution for the problem we use the
25:40 - millimeter wave R to detect the posture
25:44 - the position the movement and even very
25:47 - tetiny signal from the user the hot beat
25:52 - the Brae and maybe other signal in SLE
25:55 - qualtity and with as we know the mm wave
25:58 - read originally used by the military and
26:01 - recently used by the auto automobile
26:03 - industry and it's a big problem to use
26:07 - this technology to the home home
26:10 - scenarios because this compan raised 100
26:14 - million object and with a huge movement
26:18 - so we
26:19 - proposed Technology Series we caed one
26:22 - track to solve the problem uh we
26:25 - developed the technology from the front
26:28 - and front end such as antenna design and
26:32 - to the detto pro detto signal processing
26:36 - and to the AI modeling and for example
26:39 - the antenna design technology of our
26:42 - company is totally different from the
26:45 - current commercialized method and
26:48 - therefore we can lower the cost and
26:51 - increase the performance and currently
26:55 - we have do a lot of clinical trials and
26:58 - our result uh our product result is as
27:01 - well as even better than the health
27:03 - watch and that's why there is so much
27:05 - money clinicaly is the first one in the
27:09 - world have proved the possibility to use
27:12 - the radar to detect the uh the cardiac
27:18 - AR Aria wow the the the the the
27:24 - parameters and we have learned our first
27:28 - generation product together with the
27:30 - least company in China ha and we are Co
27:35 - branding and this product is really uh
27:39 - user friendly and we have a lot of
27:42 - Clinic trial and to Pro uh to to uh make
27:45 - sure the Precision is very high compared
27:50 - with the clinical devices and you can
27:52 - see this our product very small and
27:54 - pretty and you can just put it on the
27:57 - wall and go to sleep it's untouched and
28:00 - can detect a lot of parameters your your
28:03 - life and as well as as well we want to
28:08 - we have to make sure it's hes and we
28:10 - have to make sure it privacy data
28:13 - security so we have get a certification
28:16 - of the fccc and our company have passed
28:20 - the uh Glo the international uh quality
28:24 - control system ISO several ISO system
28:27 - for the medical devices research and
28:30 - sale and some ISO standard for the data
28:35 - privacy and this is our partner on the
28:39 - for the business and research for
28:41 - example the the the Kon in we have
28:44 - launched the co-branding product and we
28:47 - now together with opo to do the clinical
28:50 - trials in uh sever
28:52 - disease and of course there are s some
28:56 - other partners and here is our co co
28:59 - team members and you can see is from the
29:03 - top the leading universities in
29:06 - China and from different background uh
29:10 - from the bank of the communication
29:12 - Shanghai Bank of communication for the
29:14 - financing and myself is a professor
29:16 - originally in chinai University and
29:18 - major on biomedical engineering and we
29:21 - these guys have FCC approval guys not
29:23 - FDA what it
29:25 - said you know is a expert in the AI
29:28 - field and here is our plan for our
29:31 - products currently we have uh launched
29:34 - the first two and next year we will
29:36 - launch our R together with the camera to
29:39 - monitor the infant the baby and then we
29:42 - will launch another one to monitor more
29:45 - than one person uh simultaneously and
29:49 - current we uh put our Rita and the watch
29:53 - and MOB phone of opo together to the
29:55 - hospital we have get about more than uh
29:58 - really 1,000 dat set and and we know the
30:02 - trend the the technology Trend the 6G
30:05 - and short dist distance uh date
30:08 - communication is the train for future
30:11 - and the minim wave is very similar to
30:15 - the the the the technology above so we
30:17 - want to integrate our intellect
30:21 - perception method together with that
30:23 - technology and maybe more options with
30:26 - opo so uh we have closed two round of
30:31 - our uh financing and about $4 million
30:35 - and with evaluation about $2 million
30:38 - what okay that's not what it says in my
30:40 - notes guys all right I guess that was
30:41 - incorrect team now you have one a lot of
30:43 - money to raise seconds for Q and A what
30:46 - what does that say that
30:49 - here total value of previous funding
30:51 - okay maybe that was meant to be 1.5
30:53 - million I don't know what it's I have to
30:55 - install um the Hardware in every room or
31:00 - I only need to install one Hardware in
31:03 - one home so that I can monitor all the
31:06 - people family uh in fact since uh the
31:10 - Privacy reason and other technology
31:12 - reasons the mm wave we cannot allow it
31:16 - through the wall because you may monitor
31:18 - your neighbors problem so currently we
31:21 - use we use our device to in one room one
31:24 - device okay and my second question is um
31:28 - uh would that be okay that the data or
31:32 - the warning would be um installed in our
31:35 - phone so that I can know my family's
31:39 - situation yeah if your family is uh
31:42 - sharing her uh his or her data to you
31:46 - because uh the the data Pro privacy
31:51 - issue um if he allowed you can see her
31:55 - data or she data that means I still have
31:58 - to have set app yeah yeah yeah app or in
32:02 - China we have the we chat function okay
32:04 - yeah
32:08 - interesting so what they're saying guys
32:10 - this is device that you just put in the
32:11 - room you don't need to weable or
32:13 - anything your techical barrier your
32:16 - algorithm or your uh the chip uh in fact
32:22 - except the chip we designed the antenna
32:25 - and algorithm and AI model except the
32:29 - cheap uh how about compared with the
32:31 - competitors the cost and the accurancy
32:34 - of your uh solution I think uh currently
32:39 - as I just mentioned we are the only one
32:42 - company can detect the very tetiny
32:45 - signal from the maybe the the cardiac
32:48 - signal we are the that's insane that
32:49 - they can do that this kind of you're not
32:51 - wearing anything you can detect the
32:52 - signal when you're in the room of this
32:55 - thank you to Hawai medical technologist
32:57 - for your fantastic proposal judges
32:59 - please score this proposal contact L
33:02 - Health monitoring technology media
33:04 - friends please reminded to vote via the
33:06 - link we shared with you earlier on from
33:08 - media Choice also thank you yeah
33:11 - someone's saying it could be like a
33:12 - security device and you monitor like
33:14 - babies and stuff yeah this really I want
33:17 - to learn more about that 6 minutes is
33:19 - not enough to explain like how these
33:21 - things actually work right but I mean
33:24 - that that is what it is guys really that
33:27 - one is so I like the haptic one cuz I
33:29 - actually used that that's really cool
33:30 - but I could totally see like how much
33:32 - better would that be to just have that
33:34 - in the room you don't have to wear like
33:35 - a watch or aand you don't even worry
33:38 - just there you don't even know it's
33:39 - there solution for smarton okay let's
33:43 - see this is a bit of a different type
33:44 - here not as Hightech more sustainability
33:47 - Focus let me see F these
33:49 - guys sythetic biology Company from China
33:53 - uh it's my great owner to participate in
33:55 - this great event and I would like like s
33:57 - OPP to provide this opportunity that all
33:59 - these great ideas could be demonstrated
34:01 - here to realizing the innovate for
34:04 - better work today the topic will
34:06 - proposed is an Innovative eco-friendly
34:09 - packaging solution for opo
34:11 - smartphone today our world is choking on
34:14 - plastic year huge amount of the plastic
34:17 - waste leaked into the environment
34:20 - especially to the ocean this is a big
34:22 - threat to the marine animals and uh
34:26 - actually it will take hundreds of years
34:28 - for it degradable and uh this will
34:31 - create the
34:32 - microplastics to it safety to the safety
34:36 - threat to the human race ourselves you
34:38 - can see this photo that when people
34:40 - found this sea turtle there's a plastic
34:42 - in it
34:43 - nose so this is all because of the
34:46 - conventional manufacturer is based on
34:48 - the petrol oil it cannot change the
34:51 - situation fundamentally since the
34:53 - plastic created there's already 9
34:56 - billion tons of plastic uh created
34:59 - according to the oecd data there's only
35:02 - less than 10% recycled and uh there's
35:06 - reports indicate that the synthetic
35:09 - biology can provide a new path to the
35:12 - global carbon neutral and bluea is a
35:15 - company based on the synthetic biology
35:18 - which is probably the one of the hottest
35:20 - track in the past decade and the most
35:22 - attractive thing is that it can produce
35:25 - almost everything without p
35:27 - 300 million materal and molecular
35:30 - Innovation and we build our Advanced R
35:34 - platform owering product development
35:37 - today the our first pipeline product is
35:39 - bluea PHA it's a natural material it is
35:43 - based on biomass f stock and it has
35:46 - excellent
35:47 - biodegradability and the most amazing
35:50 - thing is that it has v variety
35:52 - properties similar as the plastic just
35:56 - as other uh natural materials from plant
35:59 - or from animal our pH product is from
36:02 - another natural creatures is from the
36:05 - microorganism it's just like the fat in
36:07 - the human body microbial created inside
36:10 - the cell this is a t uh T TM photos we
36:14 - took from the fermentation process you
36:17 - can see the pH grow from the cell in the
36:20 - beginning and full of the cell at the
36:25 - end and from the biobased dimension and
36:28 - biodegrad uh biodegradable Dimension pH
36:32 - is regarded as the most uh most
36:35 - biodegradable material to replace the
36:38 - conventional plastic and it also has
36:40 - some very good properties Like Oxygen
36:43 - humidity barrier and it also has the
36:46 - hydroxy stability and we can use this
36:49 - properties to create all kinds of the
36:51 - applications currently blue P has
36:54 - already achieved the international sta
36:56 - certificates on the eco-friendly and sa
37:00 - that's a pretty big deal for fing this
37:01 - experiment we took that used the sea
37:04 - water from shenen you can see the straws
37:07 - that we based on the BHA uh pH that it
37:12 - will degradate very quickly and also we
37:15 - have the very good shelf life look at
37:18 - the difference there guys on the right
37:19 - side that's there on the left side we
37:21 - attended the uh China Road Show
37:24 - inspiration challenge we proposed this
37:27 - idea to opal that uh we can provide a
37:31 - eco-friendly package but at that time we
37:33 - don't have the prop prototype the idea
37:36 - needs to turn ground so the opal ID team
37:40 - industry design team quickly get into
37:42 - touch with us and they provide their
37:44 - design they help us to design the
37:46 - package and we quickly made out this
37:49 - demo product and I I saw this in the
37:51 - demo area f it because we don't want to
37:55 - just provide a product we want to Pro
37:57 - provide a consumer good experience so
38:01 - actually feels really cool compared to
38:02 - like a normal plastic yeah yeah he's
38:05 - right that is what it feels like it was
38:06 - really cool to see that actually for
38:07 - blue pH material it aligns with the
38:10 - circular economy it is from nature and
38:14 - ends to the nature we did a a
38:17 - calculation on the carbon footprint
38:20 - versus the conventional plastic PS and
38:22 - even with uh paper so we can see that we
38:25 - can reduce huge amount of the carbon
38:27 - foodprint versus the current material
38:31 - all this is based on our technology and
38:34 - the core team our co-founders are from
38:37 - the top universities in China and the
38:40 - core team is fromal companies and
38:42 - Industry experts and we also have a very
38:46 - good platform we call it Sy OS just like
38:49 - color OS for opal and we can uh can uh
38:54 - realize the the string
38:57 - uh stren screening and uh to the product
39:00 - development High
39:01 - effectively and this is the plant we
39:04 - built in y you can see wind we can use
39:08 - the green electricity and this is the
39:11 - first phase is 5,000 uh tons per year
39:14 - and we have plans to extend to uh 75,000
39:18 - tons per year in the next W these guys
39:20 - are growing fast but start 2016 and I
39:22 - believe that hand in hand with opal we
39:24 - can you know build a better planet and
39:28 - make this world I'm here guys in
39:29 - Singapore thank you thank you blue for
39:32 - anyone just tuning in I'm in like a live
39:33 - streaming room the event happening like
39:35 - outside it's like 200 met away so after
39:38 - this I'll go out and like see everyone
39:40 - but now I'm like just streaming the
39:41 - event my question is regarding the
39:43 - manufacturing process uh what kind of
39:47 - waste and uh byproduct would come from
39:51 - this process and uh how do you deal with
39:53 - it yeah actually thanks for your
39:56 - question
39:57 - and uh it's a fermentation process so
40:00 - the most important thing is that we
40:03 - could you know separate the pH with the
40:06 - microorganism and in this part that the
40:09 - waste water will created from the
40:12 - process so our top priority is to treat
40:16 - the Water waste waste water during the
40:19 - process and we have already buil a uh
40:22 - Waste Water treatment uh sub plant in in
40:25 - the area so we will use use this to
40:29 - treat the Water waste thank you that's
40:32 - the M waste that's
40:39 - impressive yeah guys that's pretty cool
40:41 - I was messing with this at the booth
40:43 - thank you for the presentation I have a
40:44 - quick
40:45 - question capital expenditure I saw you
40:48 - have the plan to more than 10x your
40:51 - current capacity uh 3 4 years so could
40:54 - you comment on that what's the cap
40:56 - needed and billions of dollars oh my God
41:00 - yeah actually currently the land has
41:02 - already provided by the government so we
41:05 - can utilize this land uh that's
41:07 - interesting help from advantage and also
41:09 - we have already accumulated some funding
41:12 - from from the in China so that we can uh
41:16 - leverage the the the the benefit of the
41:18 - capitals to build our further uh
41:21 - projects yeah so so government
41:23 - collaboration I guess that makes sense
41:24 - because it's super sustainable
41:27 - yeah there was $300 million wow you
41:29 - mentioned uh some customizability in the
41:31 - formulations often when you're working
41:33 - with polymer polymers you need low
41:35 - molecular weight monomers for
41:37 - plasticizers exactly what I'm was going
41:39 - to ask and those can leech out uh into
41:41 - the water uh do you need these additives
41:44 - or in your customization process can you
41:46 - achieve the different materials
41:48 - properties that you need yeah actually
41:50 - PHA is a family uh material and we use
41:54 - uh different uh we we scen out a
41:57 - particular micr to produce this uh
42:00 - material and uh uh actually this
42:03 - material currently is the uh the best
42:06 - material we found in in this family
42:10 - yeah but you don't need to add any
42:13 - additional monomers to your material to
42:15 - achieve the right properties uh
42:16 - mechanical properties Yes actually we
42:18 - can adjust the second monomer in the uh
42:22 - in the uh molecular to achieve different
42:25 - kind of uh the the harness or or other
42:28 - properties thank you all right I have no
42:31 - idea what that means guys that's a bit
42:32 - beyond my my biology knowledge but hi
42:35 - just a Qui sounds it good question uh in
42:38 - terms of the
42:39 - commercializing since um it was
42:42 - indicated that the company was
42:44 - established in 2016 so any track records
42:49 - that you may share with
42:51 - us so far the the commercialized right
42:54 - yes means um the previous um products um
42:58 - by using the key technologies that you
43:01 - mentioned in the presentation yeah
43:04 - actually just like you see on the video
43:06 - we have already made the straws that and
43:09 - also cies that fit for the you know
43:12 - Environmental Protection yeah those were
43:14 - interesting I was playing with them will
43:15 - be a big Market they feel a bit weird
43:18 - butt create more lifestyle to the
43:21 - consumer so if you go to our booth we
43:24 - create the fibers and also the 3D
43:26 - printing so that it could be leverage
43:29 - the material property to create more you
43:32 - know
43:33 - markets so this material they made it 3D
43:36 - printable and they have a bunch of like
43:37 - figurines and stuff
43:39 - theyd and they have like col boxes it
43:42 - was pretty I was pretty impressed how
43:43 - much stuff they actually were able to
43:45 - make the link so this one I think is
43:48 - like probably one of the more
43:50 - established companies that's here but I
43:51 - mean there R $300 million guys that's
43:53 - insane from 2016 they built their own
43:54 - plant um um yeah if if they get those
43:58 - government relationships like they say
44:00 - they have they can grow super quickly
44:04 - right fromy progam for preventing by the
44:08 - way the weather is hot oh my God it's
44:10 - like 30° and so humid here compared to
44:13 - Canada all right let me get my notes for
44:15 - this
44:16 - one online Therapy Program for
44:18 - preventing myo FAS sheld I'm not sure
44:21 - how you say that pain syndrome and
44:22 - chronic pain these guys are pre Ser
44:29 - A2 do you feel stiffness do you have
44:32 - neck and shoulder pain yes definitely oh
44:35 - my God you guys probably have that too
44:36 - problem call office
44:40 - syndrome hi my name is Ben from the
44:42 - tical team an accessible and efficient
44:45 - solution for curing office
44:47 - syndrome do you believe that in the next
44:49 - 20 year people could look like this with
44:51 - the rapid growth in technology our body
44:53 - can keep it's going to be me in like 5
44:55 - years guys
44:58 - suffer from Office syndrome muscle
45:00 - issues it's lower the productivity
45:03 - and sleep problem chronic pain and
45:06 - burnout syndrome not only it caused the
45:09 - pain to our body but it caused 3,860
45:13 - economic lost really what we do to fix
45:15 - the problem right now wonder how they
45:16 - measured that we use pills needle and
45:19 - massage but how much more time we need
45:21 - to do in order to be Kure it's non
45:23 - continuous can fall off and have high
45:25 - cost like sitting up straight time for
45:27 - everyone vertical is here to make curing

46:48 - for now guys they're like brand
46:50 - new with around 8 to 10 minute of
46:52 - Engagement time we have post test with
46:55 - our users and they got better after
46:58 - using
46:59 - ero 91% we have Jo Thailand hrx this
47:02 - year and we won a mer award for pitching
47:05 - then got around 150 Prospect we have
47:08 - four main competive advantage first alra
47:11 - personalization we can personalize the
47:13 - stretch to any kind of activities and
47:16 - lifestyle because we have various kind
47:18 - of assets and is highly customizable in
47:21 - the pace and length second is safe is
47:24 - safe safety because our expert design it
47:27 - one by one yeah and we can use it safely
47:31 - then it's trackable it can be used as
47:32 - tracking to for the use for the experts
47:35 - then it can redeem a real life reward
47:38 - starting in Thailand when compared to
47:40 - our compor we are more complete in term
47:43 - of
47:45 - treatments the market size is calculated
47:47 - to be 820
47:49 - million that's it a business model like
47:52 - this we do a premier model everyone can
47:54 - download and then we with the slides
47:56 - here PR with a B2B customer we're
47:59 - working with a partner like Fitness
48:01 - Clinic looks like they're charging
48:03 - 59 is that per month or per year I wish
48:06 - bring that slide back I want to see what
48:07 - for insurance we are working with them
48:09 - to create a sponsorship where we can use
48:11 - artical with the customer and they can
48:13 - access to their selfcare data our go to
48:16 - make a strategy we are trying to
48:18 - increase the user right now and then the
48:20 - partner and B2B customer will come yeah
48:22 - they need more users toate goal is to be
48:25 - an SD for tele medicine and healthare
48:27 - system to create a UniFi muscle care
48:30 - experience for everyone so they want to
48:32 - like integrate with a bunch other prods
48:34 - and a 10 goal of sdg we want to make
48:37 - sure that everyone including the visual
48:39 - impair have access to muscle selfcare do
48:42 - you know that there is 1 billion which
48:44 - impair user around the world but they
48:45 - cannot use Fitness video and fitness
48:47 - media to take care of their muscles oh
48:50 - so they can use article because we have
48:52 - P matching wi description they can
48:54 - follow it even if they can see
48:59 - weuse to
49:02 - re up
49:04 - Corporation we want to use an oper panel
49:07 - system to the ople system that create to
49:10 - create the connection in the internet of
49:12 - experience along with a device like ople
49:14 - oel and opo bands how imagine at this
49:18 - event you sit a lot you use your phone a
49:20 - lot then we can personalize the stretch
49:23 - for you we can personalize and shoulder
49:26 - stretch and lower back stretch to the
49:27 - smart widget on your oper phone and at
49:31 - they should do that they should have
49:32 - done like a demo here that would be cool
49:33 - U monitor the help result and then we
49:36 - can use that to improve the algorithm of
49:39 - personalization this way a can help
49:41 - improve the preventive care in the opo
49:44 - ecosystem here is the implementation
49:46 - plan we will first explore the Pano
49:49 - system and see which data we can use to
49:51 - recommend the stretch then we will try
49:53 - to launch kind of beta testing next year
49:56 - is is
49:56 - possible the journey forward if we got
49:59 - the 5K Grant we will accelerate the
50:01 - process of SDK development for
50:03 - healthcare and tele medicine we'll do
50:05 - CSR development to create a solution
50:07 - self caring for visually impair then
50:10 - we'll expand and raise an awareness of
50:11 - this condition to the world we have a
50:14 - strong team in both Business technical
50:16 - and healthc care
50:18 - specialist we are ready to make your
50:21 - muscle healthy thank you well thank you
50:23 - team that kind of fits with the tie
50:25 - backg think
50:28 - Mass you mentioned you have 500 monthly
50:32 - active users um can you share what is
50:34 - the most used feature on the app yeah
50:39 - def is the stretching so most of the
50:42 - users tend to stretch in the neck and
50:44 - shoulder because it's the muscle that is
50:47 - easily strained yeah
50:50 - look like everyone watching exercise
50:53 - yeah we have an ergonomically designed
50:56 - animation it's the pace is going to
50:58 - match let's say when you want to relieve
51:01 - your muscle you need to stretch at least
51:02 - 10 or 15 second if you stret like 3
51:05 - second it's not going to release the
51:06 - muscle yeah so that's how it work right
51:09 - now just follow along with some video or
51:12 - some guided stretch okay interesting
51:14 - idea but mentioned that you're to exit
51:18 - by developing an SDK and integrating
51:20 - this into a larger infrastructure um
51:22 - wondering what is your strategic
51:24 - advantage against your competitor I
51:25 - guess it's not in the app itself or the
51:27 - this guy good questions but in the
51:30 - content or the way that you're
51:31 - delivering that content yeah yeah so um
51:34 - we start by um exploring like a tie
51:38 - traditional stretching techniques so we
51:40 - focus on Mak sense not like the stretch
51:42 - that you need to take a yoga M and take
51:44 - like an hour of stretch we focus on the
51:46 - stretch that can be integrated in your
51:48 - life when you sit when you go to the
51:50 - toilet when you work when you at your
51:52 - share so the thing that we try to do is
51:55 - try to make it personalize to you like
51:56 - you get the music personalize playlist
51:59 - we have a personaliz stretching list
52:02 - that you can incorporate into your daily
52:04 - life and make your body work with the Le
52:07 - less least amount of efficience I'm not
52:10 - really understanding how they
52:11 - personalize that too much you like go in
52:13 - person or something mentioned um AI
52:16 - algorithms as being a source of
52:18 - improving the solution where do you get
52:19 - your training data from from the initial
52:22 - outset I would say right now we use an
52:24 - open source to detect the post right now
52:27 - yeah but the way we recommend we still
52:30 - use the condition where it's on like we
52:32 - try on thousand of research to do which
52:35 - thing because right now I think to
52:38 - recommend the data we need to base on
52:40 - the will and meal reseearch to recommend
52:42 - which um exercise match with each muscle
52:45 - but the AI we use to detect the post and
52:48 - skeleton
52:52 - yeah interesting I don't think you
52:54 - really answered the question
52:55 - mention um your one of your business
52:58 - model is B2 B2 c will you be able to
53:02 - illustrate a little bit more for this
53:05 - B2B it's just a app or you will just
53:09 - combine together with some off uh SDK
53:13 - he's talking about with your partners or
53:15 - clinics Etc yeah so B2B we mainly focus
53:18 - on the HR solution when we go to do a
53:20 - training for the employees okay and then
53:24 - after they do a training each one of the
53:25 - employee have different condition we
53:27 - will okay this employee have a neck and
53:29 - shoulder problem this one have this this
53:32 - um person have a leg problem so each one
53:34 - going to have a personalized and
53:36 - trackable plan so that our expert who do
53:39 - a training can uh follow up and really
53:42 - make an efficient training to the
53:45 - company like would you guys want this
53:47 - let let me know in the chat if you guys
53:49 - would actually use something like this
53:50 - or not approach and B2B solution right
53:52 - now it seems interesting like if your
53:54 - company said give this you for free
53:56 - would you guys actually use this like
53:58 - day today I don't know I might try it
54:00 - but don't know seems tough like online
54:03 - app I'd like to know their uh retention
54:06 - rate on on people right 91% of people
54:08 - said improve how many kept that's
54:12 - probably the most important for
54:13 - something like this let me know what you
54:15 - guys think in the chat here if you guys
54:17 - have questions uh put them in here I'll
54:18 - answer them as much as I can for anyone
54:20 - just tuning in I'm in Singapore right
54:21 - now this is a live event next going to
54:24 - be one more have a small break for AI
54:27 - Inc Froman with the proposal easy speech
54:32 - easy speech all right let's hear this
54:34 - one these guys have raised 40K no 400k
54:40 - us they're in pre-series a 2023 brand
54:45 - new startup 11 to 15
54:48 - employees speech is one of the most
54:51 - important and fundamental skills for
54:53 - both individual large we express our
54:56 - feelings using words we defend our
54:58 - position using verbal communication we
55:01 - connect with people by speaking to them
55:04 - we remember the day when our kids said
55:06 - their first
55:07 - word there are over 100 million people
55:10 - worldwide with various speech disorders
55:12 - including kids with cerebal Psy autism
55:15 - Down syndrome adults during poststroke
55:17 - Rehabilitation and Parkinson and
55:21 - unfortunately and unfortunately there is
55:24 - a uh lack of speech therapist everywhere
55:28 - in the world waiting list is uh in US is
55:31 - three months Germany is six is crazy
55:34 - trying to find these even for free fees
55:36 - are not affordable for families from
55:38 - low-income
55:40 - communities insurance if any all covers
55:43 - only limited number of sessions and
55:46 - there is also uh no personalization to
55:48 - the tratment uh both parents and
55:51 - therapist lacked objective data to uh
55:55 - monitor the programs and if let's face
55:57 - it it's um difficult for kids to do
55:59 - boring
56:01 - exercises so easy speech uh will uh uh
56:05 - eliminate waiting list uh and we will
56:08 - transform the therapy into fun games for
56:10 - kids we also equip uh therapist with a
56:15 - powerful tool to customize the treatment
56:18 - plan based on the robot robust data and
56:21 - reports and all this at affordable price
56:25 - available anywhere
56:27 - anytime easy speech like uh human
56:30 - therapists only dig take a look at the
56:32 - sample video and do the same it's guys
56:34 - to use it throughout the entire
56:37 - process move tongue lower assesses accur
56:40 - performance
56:42 - provides feedback and generates reports
56:45 - and recommendations there are a lot of
56:48 - speech apps on the market but all of
56:51 - them are limited to demonstration of
56:53 - exercises and maybe one US covers
56:56 - limited sound assessments whereas most
56:59 - or many of the uh Speech disorders
57:02 - require initially to develop oral motor
57:05 - apparatus and F
57:08 - motoric the only one which covers both
57:10 - oral motor and sound practices and we
57:14 - are the only one which assesses the
57:15 - accuracy of performance do
57:17 - personalization realtime feedback and uh
57:21 - data and Reporting we have developed our
57:24 - application
57:25 - for children with children with the
57:28 - speech therapist and their parents we
57:30 - also trained our neural network on the
57:34 - kids and adults of varied age ethnicity
57:37 - and gender to minimize bias assessment
57:40 - and uh furthermore we have a
57:42 - controllable I AI our algorithms are
57:46 - highly customizable specific face
57:48 - parameters and individual abilities our
57:51 - business model is B2 b2c we planed the
57:54 - we plan that the app will be distributed
57:56 - uh primarily through the speech centers
57:58 - and
57:59 - rehabs uh initially we were concentrated
58:03 - only on b2c but all Pilots we had
58:05 - confirm a strong interest from
58:07 - institutional users to use the app as
58:10 - in-house simulator and a tool for remote
58:13 - patient and monitoring those very
58:15 - interest you prescrib this from your
58:17 - doors generated by the app speech
58:19 - therapist I guess they will the clinics
58:21 - will be able to increase the number of
58:24 - patient Serv
58:25 - uh which will increase their revenues
58:27 - but also it will decrease uh the
58:30 - operating expenses because we will save
58:32 - up to 25% of time currently spent on
58:35 - paperwork but at the same time
58:38 - introduction of hibrid method of
58:40 - treatment will decrease the cost to the
58:42 - patient by
58:44 - 40% because they need less treatment I
58:46 - guess that's interesting I wonder how
58:47 - much they charge for this 19 mimic
58:50 - exercises covering uh tongue lips Joe's
58:54 - and brows and a model with over 200 uh
58:56 - sound practices assessing sounds at the
58:59 - beginning middle and end of the world we
59:01 - have collected and labeled our unique
59:04 - database data sets and we have achieved
59:07 - Precision accuracy and recall rate in
59:09 - the range of 70 to 90 in the lab and in
59:12 - the pilots we have been conducted for
59:14 - year and a half in various speech
59:16 - centers and rehabs and we filed a Pon
59:19 - application and start initiated C Mark
59:23 - preparation uh once we complete GPR
59:25 - compliance which is hopefully going to
59:27 - be uh this October uh we're going to
59:30 - launch as a Fitness and Wellness
59:31 - application but the plan is to get
59:34 - certified as a medical um device and uh
59:38 - to sign the contract with uh corporate
59:41 - uh users in 2024 and in 2025 to get FDA
59:45 - approval to get to US market but
59:47 - ultimate goal to become a plat matching
59:49 - platform between the therapist and the
59:52 - patients okay that makes more sense to
59:53 - me best prct ice worldwide you go on
59:57 - there they collect your data and then
59:58 - they send you the appropriate spee one
60:01 - of them uh we believe and we are
60:03 - piloting our solution in several markets
60:05 - including us uh UK and
60:08 - Spain uh so the uh uh we can be we
60:14 - believe that we can achieve breaking
60:16 - within seven months after we hit active
60:19 - uh 400 active users what is their price
60:22 - per user there because the waiting list
60:24 - is ion of people we don't see any
60:27 - problem achieving that number our
60:29 - funding needs is uh $2 million primarily
60:33 - to do certification process and clinical
60:35 - trials to get to the you and we can
60:38 - greatly
60:39 - benefit with OPP hey guys uh do
60:44 - productization especially performance
60:46 - enhancements on their mobile uh for form
60:49 - as for strategy well uh self driving
60:54 - cars and cashierless stores are already
60:56 - there so imagine our product our
61:00 - application on uh your devices helping
61:03 - elderly people somewhere in the Care
61:06 - Facility or imagine a self uh uh self
61:10 - trining class in a school for kids with
61:15 - disability uh and your devices have you
61:18 - imagine well we already have they have
61:20 - that like an English class or something
61:21 - that could be interesting we can do
61:23 - something together with Oppo in China
61:26 - Asia and worldwide we are the global
61:29 - team with global Ambitions supported by
61:32 - Leading mentors from Healthcare
61:34 - institutions they're all over the place
61:36 - and Europe and we will be a great feed
61:38 - for
61:40 - Oppo nice that was interesting thank you
61:43 - so much and now you have two minutes for
61:45 - Q&A judges
61:47 - please I'm curious how well that
61:49 - actually works right like how effective
61:51 - is an app when you're trying to learn
61:53 - the real time feedback I think is the
61:54 - biggest Advantage i' say syy with OP
61:56 - products yes we believe that uh our app
61:59 - can be installed on the devices of op
62:02 - whether it's a tabs or mobile phones and
62:05 - that that can be implemented uh as a
62:08 - consumer product at home but also in the
62:10 - hospital rehabilitation centers um so
62:13 - that we we believe that there is
62:15 - something Oppo can uh definitely benefit
62:18 - uh as well I don't really see the Deep
62:19 - integration with Oppo here unless they
62:21 - just like sponsor them and and and help
62:23 - them grow right because it's just an app
62:25 - you can download on like any device City
62:27 - I mean just now you mentioned China is
62:29 - one of your biggest target market have
62:32 - you done any trial in China yet uh not
62:37 - not in China unfortunately we have done
62:41 - Africa Asia and um Europe us but not in
62:46 - China you said Asia but like what
62:48 - country um if that say um you are
62:51 - expanding in China will you consider to
62:56 - get a more international team to create
63:00 - uh versions of your uh different
63:03 - languages uh oh that's a good point
63:05 - actually yeah they needed all the
63:06 - languages question the thing is with the
63:08 - oral motor we have two modules oral
63:10 - motor exercises which basically
63:12 - development of the tongue lips Jaws etc
63:16 - those uh are the same in every languages
63:19 - we've noticed whether it's Africa or us
63:22 - or Germany there's no we need to retrain
63:26 - the neural network to recognize uh
63:29 - Mandarin or languages in countries
63:33 - that's not an easy task okay uh version
63:36 - they have to retrain the whole model in
63:38 - another language I don't know if that's
63:39 - ideal had this Oppo uh competition in
63:43 - Bangkok we got a call from Bangkok uh
63:46 - they are interested as well in Thailand
63:48 - all right thank you so much Mila for AI
63:51 - Inc for your wonderful proposal that was
63:54 - interesting it's kind of all over the
63:55 - place for me easy spe and of like that
63:59 - is a huge huge issue I can remember like
64:02 - at elementary school kids going to like
64:04 - you know a little classroom to like work
64:06 - on their speech right not being able to
64:07 - pronounce so can you imagine being able
64:10 - to actually just do that from an app if
64:11 - that's actually effective and then if
64:13 - you need more then you go to a speech
64:15 - pathologist or whatever they said rather
64:17 - than paying for that up front when like
64:19 - a consultation could be like a few
64:21 - hundred I know in Canada like people
64:22 - spend thousands of dollars that so they
64:25 - I don't know if they said how much their
64:26 - app cost though I would like to see how
64:27 - much the price is if it's one time fee
64:30 - if it's a subscription what their
64:31 - pricing model is paper batteries this is
64:35 - solution safer more sustainable and cost
64:38 - efficient future when it comes to
64:40 - Battery tech but before I get into that
64:42 - I want to tell you why we need them this
64:44 - cuz have zero funding so far
64:47 - boing and that's only a 2% decrease in
64:51 - the past 20 years 2% that has been
64:55 - converted into green energy now when we
64:57 - think about green energy we often you
64:59 - know think about solar panels windmills
65:01 - and so on but what we often don't
65:03 - realize is the infrastructure that's
65:06 - required to enable that switch to Green
65:08 - energy and a huge part of that
65:10 - infrastructure is batteries but here's
65:13 - the catch the batteries that we
65:15 - currently use and the metals that we use
65:17 - in them are not only toxic but very
65:20 - scarse as well so if you run the numbers
65:23 - H is
65:24 - recycling initiatives while they're
65:26 - Noble are nothing but a short-term
65:28 - Band-Aid solution so if you really want
65:31 - that 2% to become 20 or even 50% in the
65:35 - future given how material intensive our
65:38 - current battery Tech is we are never
65:40 - getting there so a dream of a Greener
65:43 - future demands Greener batteries and
65:46 - that's precisely where Flint's paper
65:48 - batteries come in now I want to he this
65:50 - sounds cool all batteries are
65:52 - rechargeable and they work pretty much
65:53 - the same same way as traditional
65:55 - batteries do but what we have done is to
65:57 - use different materials we have come up
65:59 - with what we call hydrogen reinforced
66:02 - cellulose paper and utilize zinc and
66:04 - manganese as the two sides of the
66:06 - battery and thanks to our proprietary
66:08 - Tech and knowledge we have unlocked
66:10 - three new features that you have never
66:12 - seen before in any other Battery tech
66:15 - all right this got me excited our
66:16 - batteries are fully
66:19 - compostable
66:21 - now okay let's give this a moment while
66:24 - this doesn't have paper batteries that's
66:26 - probably why it's not working that well
66:27 - that's funny it needs a flint battery
66:29 - and this is not
66:31 - clicking can I have some help with this
66:34 - okay there it goes so these are all
66:36 - batteries that are fully compostable
66:39 - which means at the end of its life cycle
66:40 - you could throw it away into the soil
66:42 - and within a month it would completely
66:44 - degrade and really that's not to say
66:46 - that we want everyone to start throwing
66:48 - our batteries around but it does make it
66:50 - a whole lot easier and cheaper to
66:53 - recycle them and that reduces the
66:55 - environmental impact
66:57 - significantly now paper that's something
67:00 - that you guys have in your hands right
67:01 - now you know how light and flexible it
67:03 - is and this gives our batteries its
67:05 - adaptive design and just to prove our
67:07 - point we have designed our batteries in
67:10 - the shape of the Singapore M emblem as
67:12 - well now our batteries can be bent while
67:16 - it's functional without affecting its
67:18 - performance or causing any kind safety
67:21 - hazard and when we talk about hazards
67:23 - like in terms of where you could
67:24 - actually put that moves around the
67:26 - battery we went one step further to show
67:29 - you how safe our batteries are by
67:31 - cutting them while it's an operation and
67:34 - it didn't overheat imagine doing with a
67:36 - real battery to work corrosive normal
67:40 - it's not real battery other type
67:42 - batter all we have to do because of this
67:45 - adaptive design is to build our
67:47 - batteries in the required shape and size
67:50 - and stack them up and you would
67:52 - practically have a plug and place
67:54 - solution to replace any type of lithium
67:56 - batteries that are out there right now
67:58 - so you just layer them because of how
68:00 - production friendly our batteries are in
68:02 - order to make them we don't have to
68:04 - reinvent the wheel we can use existing
68:06 - manufacturing processes and equipment to
68:09 - make this possible and the best part is
68:12 - given how abundant the raw materials
68:14 - that we use are the cost of making our
68:17 - batteries is 10 times cheaper than
68:19 - traditional batteries wow now that's a
68:22 - huge game changer because think about it
68:24 - if you going to put our battery on a 2X
68:26 - two Matrix against other Battery tech
68:28 - you'd realize that not only is ours one
68:30 - of the most sustainable but also one of
68:32 - the most cost efficient options that are
68:34 - out there and that makes us the most
68:37 - practical solution in the market I'm
68:39 - curious how many you actually need
68:41 - though to get the same power
68:44 - output's see if and using industry
68:47 - standard metric this is how our
68:49 - batteries perform today volumetric how
68:52 - expect it energy density
68:55 - and we start toize it and build this in
68:58 - scale now you have to that we're not
69:01 - just comparing here we're pioneering but
69:04 - given the current performance of our
69:05 - batteries we decided to come up with
69:07 - three specialized versions of paper
69:09 - batteries for a focused area of
69:11 - application so that we can either match
69:14 - or outperform lithium batteries in these
69:16 - areas so when it comes to cost and
69:19 - safety we're already much further ahead
69:21 - and when we want to increase the
69:22 - capacity within a limited volume we can
69:24 - use paper batteries in energy storage
69:27 - systems we're working together with
69:29 - Collinson power is one of Singapore's
69:31 - largest energy storage system providers
69:33 - to make this happen now when we want to
69:35 - reduce the weight and the volume you can
69:38 - start to see paper batteries in your
69:40 - everyday consumer products your your
69:42 - phones your wearables and remote senses
69:45 - working together with Technics company
69:47 - to replace the batteries in the remote
69:49 - sensors for explosives now those are
69:52 - tiny batteries
69:54 - when we try to increase the capacity but
69:56 - decrease the weight at the same time and
69:58 - you finally have the dream of having
70:00 - green batteries in your EVS so one day
70:04 - you could be driving an EV that's not
70:06 - only cheaper but safer and a whole lot
70:09 - more sustainable now the team that's
70:12 - build all the team that's building this
70:14 - has over 30 years of management
70:16 - experience and expertise in areas like
70:18 - Material Science mechanical design
70:20 - Advanced physics among others and we are
70:22 - being supported by individuals from some
70:24 - of the top universities governmental
70:27 - organizations and even companies like
70:28 - shell backing us up and all this is
70:31 - because at Flint we want to be powering
70:34 - the future not just any future but a
70:37 - Greener future and to make this possible
70:40 - we want to work together with you now
70:43 - over the next 3 years our conservative
70:45 - Revenue estimate lies at about 160
70:48 - million and that's expected to grow 20
70:50 - times by 2030 as we explore into new
70:53 - markets out there so we want to invite
70:56 - you to join us on this transformative
70:58 - Journey as we're looking for partnership
71:00 - opportunities and collaborative designes
71:03 - so if you're ready to build that Greener
71:05 - future we have Fint and we're eager to
71:08 - connect with you thank you thank you
71:10 - that was that was that's one of the
71:12 - better presentations I think that they
71:13 - gave it was very clear I understand
71:15 - exactly what he means but I don't I want
71:16 - to see the size of a battery relevant to
71:19 - uh compared to a normal quick the
71:22 - several key parameters of the batteries
71:25 - including capacity uh charging
71:28 - speed yeah sure so let's say for a 1 by
71:31 - 1 cm size of battery paper battery that
71:34 - we have the voltage is about 1.5 to 2
71:37 - volts and we're pushing that to three as
71:39 - you speak and the capacity that it has
71:42 - is about 35 milliamp so scale it up to
71:45 - about the battery that you saw in the
71:47 - video earlier I'm not sure if you recall
71:49 - but the one that was powering the fan
71:50 - that is about 350 milliamp of capacity
71:53 - it's pretty one thin slice of paper
71:57 - battery I want to see like a side by
72:00 - side parameters do you have a road map
72:03 - of what kind of applications to go first
72:06 - and uh finally go to the EV right okay
72:09 - so the beach hit Market that we're
72:12 - targeting right now is 18650 battery
72:14 - Beach hit Market that we're targeting
72:16 - right now is 18650 batteries because
72:19 - based on the current performance of our
72:21 - batteries we feel that that's the best
72:22 - way to go forward and we're working
72:24 - together with Collins and powers to
72:26 - bring paper batteries into energy
72:27 - storage systems so backup generators for
72:30 - buildings that's the first Beach hit
72:31 - that makes s we don't have a huge size
72:33 - speak in 2024 when we move forward to
72:36 - the pilot production stage now that
72:37 - we're done with R&D what is going to
72:39 - happen is that we are opening up to a
72:42 - lot of companies like opo and all these
72:44 - other companies that I mentioned earlier
72:46 - we're opening up to them to see how we
72:47 - can bring paper batteries into these
72:49 - various products and if we see value and
72:51 - a lot of demand in that particular
72:53 - sector we would move forward there as
72:56 - well interesting thank
73:02 - you think it seems really I I just want
73:05 - to see the size of it because I don't
73:07 - know if it actually would fit in like a
73:09 - smartphone that's a very good question
73:11 - so lithium batteries over 2,000 life
73:14 - cycles so that's about like six years of
73:16 - using that battery right let's say in
73:17 - your phone or any other use case over
73:20 - 2,000 life cycles the efficiency drops
73:21 - down to about 70%
73:24 - our batteries over 1,000 life cycles
73:26 - because it takes a long time to test
73:28 - these out has dropped to only 80% so in
73:31 - terms of efficiency and life cycle we're
73:32 - slightly on the lower end but as we move
73:35 - to its commercialization these numbers
73:36 - are going to improve
73:38 - significantly so it's worse from that
73:40 - but not by a lot so much Flint for your
73:43 - wonderful proposal judges please score
73:46 - that was pretty good guys I like that
73:48 - one I think it was a good presentation
73:49 - but again I just they're so new they
73:51 - don't really have enough information to
73:53 - to say like how impactful the battery
73:56 - can actually be if you could put that in
73:57 - an EV that'd be huge right cuz I'm not
73:59 - sure if you guys have seen the impact of
74:01 - actually making like a battery that goes
74:02 - into the EV is it pretty much completely
74:04 - diminishes the whole point of having an
74:07 - EV actually make that type battery
74:09 - non-surgical hearing aid non-surgical
74:12 - hearing
74:13 - aid they they do have a real sample guys
74:16 - they have one in the uh the demo area
74:19 - but I don't know if they have time to do
74:21 - that on stage so I did see it but it's
74:23 - kind of hard right we have a little
74:24 - slight like it's not very visual to
74:26 - actually tell uh how good it is but that
74:28 - was a good presentation all right who
74:30 - are we on now good afternoon everyone so
74:33 - today we are here to share the music of
74:36 - song We Are R and lexman from
74:40 - start he's got to move the mic up to his
74:42 - mouth
74:45 - there there you go children close to me
74:49 - close so this is a problem we are going
74:52 - to solve so you were not able to hear us
74:55 - for few seconds and you became worried
74:59 - imagine the millions of children who
75:01 - cannot be able to hear all their life so
75:05 - meet Mr Sund he was born without the
75:08 - ability to hear medically known as
75:10 - congenital hearing loss we call them
75:13 - severe and profound hearing loss so
75:15 - there's a lots of hearing devices
75:17 - available in the market like BTC devices
75:20 - ITC devices or bone conduction devices
75:22 - so those devices doesn't help him the
75:25 - only solution for a Sunder and millions
75:28 - of children like him around the world is
75:31 - Cocker implants so Cocker implants are
75:34 - fixed by the means of open skull surgery
75:37 - oh my but it has a many problems mainly
75:41 - it require a highrisk open skull surgery
75:43 - and it's very very expensive it can cost
75:47 - up to
75:48 - $115,000 per implant and it's very risky
75:52 - per implant during a surgery it even
75:55 - caus a brain infection nerve damage and
75:58 - even a facial sound like a reasonable
76:00 - solution the hearing a implantation the
76:02 - patient have to lead a restrictive lives
76:05 - like they cannot take an MRI they cannot
76:08 - use a smartphone they cannot do
76:09 - adventure sports and surgery is also
76:12 - ruled out after the age of eight so it
76:15 - is not a small problem globally 1.7
76:19 - million childrens are born with a
76:21 - congenital hearing loss every year so
76:25 - for them we at backat creators have
76:27 - inverted the world's first non-surgical
76:30 - hearing device for congenital hearing
76:33 - loss patients our product is called
76:35 - impulse so no more parents need to drill
76:38 - their children's SK for hearing we are
76:40 - completely 1100 USD is still pretty
76:42 - expensive hearing Los signicant there is
76:44 - no risk while using our product they can
76:47 - still take a life saving dnos service
76:49 - such as M at last our device is highly
76:52 - affordable able we are reduced the cost
76:54 - from over
76:56 - $115,000 to
76:58 - $1,00 still a lot but
77:01 - that's nonallergic silicon composite it
77:05 - can be easily removable without any
77:07 - surgical
77:08 - intervention so the Simplicity of our
77:11 - Technologies our biggest strength we are
77:14 - using a patented method of applying a
77:16 - electromagnetic stimulation where we are
77:19 - providing electromagnetic stimulation
77:21 - directly to the co COA is the inner ear
77:24 - organ so by providing that we are
77:26 - stimulating the sensory neurons of the
77:29 - ccka by doing that we are making them
77:32 - here without having any internal
77:34 - implantation surgeries these guys raised
77:36 - 125k by the way us they're 2021
77:40 - providing
77:41 - our a continuous speech therapy to
77:44 - recognize the sounds that they are
77:46 - hearing for a first time so we have MVP
77:50 - ready we have successfully clinically
77:53 - piloted with 50 plus patients and we
77:55 - have a two International pattern for our
77:56 - earing a technology so our research work
77:59 - is also backed by a doctor Milan K
78:02 - highly awarded ENT surgeon of India who
78:05 - done a 3,000 plus implant surgeries
78:08 - by the way guys all the demos and stuff
78:10 - I'm going to show you some of them I'm
78:12 - making a video that I'm going post on
78:13 - the channel in a few days and you'll see
78:14 - some of the stuff like the demo area
78:16 - I'll show you over 30 million childrens
78:18 - required a hearing aid implant to treat
78:21 - their hearing loss so they can readily
78:23 - op our device non- surgical
78:25 - one so here is our business model so
78:28 - these four primary stakeholders are
78:29 - going to be our potential resellers or a
78:32 - distributor
78:33 - Partners yeah stay tuned guys if you I
78:35 - have a travel Vlog coming on a few video
78:37 - days I'm share
78:44 - [Music]
78:51 - this
78:58 - yeah look at that wow can you imagine
79:00 - being like here for the first time that'
79:02 - be crazy yeah look at his
79:07 - eyes so you may notice the children said
79:10 - book from the bir he doesn't hear a
79:13 - single sound and also he doesn't speak
79:16 - while using our device for a first time
79:18 - from the book we Are enabled them to
79:20 - hear through our device and also on
79:22 - providing a continuous speech therapy to
79:25 - them we are also enable them to speak so
79:28 - here is our team we are Raman and lakman
79:30 - working on the product development for
79:31 - last 3 years holding multiple patterns
79:33 - in the hering a technology it's very
79:36 - impressive advisory team who over 50
79:38 - plus years of a combined experience in
79:40 - Audiology Acoustics and medical device
79:43 - development so we are going to sell our
79:45 - product at the cost of $900 to a B2 b2c
79:49 - model that's a better price competitive
79:51 - landscape what is the alternate solution
79:53 - which is available in the market which
79:55 - is a implant it requires a highrisk open
79:57 - skull surgery so what value we are going
80:00 - to deliver to a patient is non-surgical
80:02 - which suit for all ages with zero
80:05 - restriction at a very affordable cost so
80:08 - here is our Milestone and timeline for
80:10 - Regulatory and certification Pathways Q7
80:13 - so here's a phot giving demonstration to
80:15 - head of wh when he visit she visited our
80:18 - testing lab so we would like to Leverage
80:22 - The strength of Oppo in manufacturing
80:25 - and distribution footprint in our target
80:27 - market so we sees there are four areas
80:31 - we can have a Synergy between Oppo and
80:33 - impulse devices mainly a sound quality
80:37 - our device work well in the silent zone
80:40 - so we wish to enhance the sound quality
80:43 - and hearing by a big computational Power
80:46 - that Oppo smartphone have with the
80:48 - conjunction of our device and
80:50 - affordability as Oppo positioning as a
80:53 - most affordable smartphone it's a
80:55 - perfect partner for us to provide a
80:57 - lowcost and affordable solution to a
81:00 - developing countries in Asia including
81:03 - India and we are reducing the hardware
81:05 - eliminating the need of additional
81:07 - Hardwares like a transmitters and tele
81:09 - coils by having our core key technology
81:12 - of BL integration with the smartphone
81:14 - and we are also providing a value
81:15 - addition features like Wireless
81:17 - connectivity noise reduction battery
81:20 - level management and calibration of a
81:22 - hearing devices through the Oppo
81:24 - smartphone I would like to see the
81:26 - battery on that strongly believes that
81:28 - together with Oppo smartphone and
81:30 - impulse device we can make a beautiful
81:32 - world for the childrens with the hearing
81:34 - disability and we are also achieving a
81:37 - STG goal three directly with this good
81:40 - health and wellbeing and indirectly a
81:42 - goal 4 8 10 with the empowering the
81:45 - individuals with hearing disability so
81:48 - we have our functional prototype which
81:49 - even we can you can feel the sound how
81:52 - the the children can able to sh without
81:54 - any I didn't check that in the demo I'm
81:56 - going to look at that after cuz I
81:57 - actually want to see what that's like oh
81:59 - he has it
82:00 - here thank you so much while you now
82:03 - have 1 minute 25 seconds for Q&A judges
82:07 - please oh I guess they're going to miss
82:08 - the demo there that's too
82:12 - bad hello guys you mentioned the
82:15 - clinical trials yes obviously as soon as
82:18 - you put the impulse uh sensor on there
82:22 - will be level of hearing but have you
82:24 - been able to track the level of hearing
82:27 - and the development of those patients
82:30 - and how long does it take to take them
82:33 - through the process these guys have good
82:34 - questiona it's really a good question so
82:37 - hearing and learning are a both a
82:39 - different thing so what clinical study
82:41 - which we have done is completely
82:43 - medically framed one which is called C
82:46 - method so CP is a method to assess
82:48 - whether they can able to hear the sound
82:50 - in a multiple levels so it is done for
82:52 - for the 2 months long duration with the
82:54 - multiple patient category so all these
82:57 - childrens doesn't get benefited through
82:58 - the traditional devices so they only
83:00 - suits for Implant but they can use our
83:03 - device and they can provide it with the
83:05 - speech therapy for 2 months post that
83:07 - they can able to hear the sound through
83:09 - our device and also they can
83:11 - discriminate those sounds through our
83:12 - device also post hearing sir okay that
83:15 - makes sense they can actually tell the
83:17 - difference between the sounds not like
83:18 - they just hear some random vibration
83:21 - right
83:24 - is the TMS technology suitable for uh
83:28 - all kinds of people with heing L or just
83:31 - certain types sir actually we are
83:34 - focusing only for severe and profund Sir
83:37 - so for the other types like a mild and
83:39 - moderate there's lots of hearing devices
83:41 - which is already available as you seen b
83:44 - the year devices buts like devices OTC
83:46 - devices un bone conduction devices are
83:49 - already available in the market to help
83:50 - thems but the this congenital hearing
83:53 - loss they only get treated with the
83:55 - implant that's the only ideal solution
83:58 - available across the world so we like to
84:00 - replace that with the non-surgical sir
84:02 - so that's why we are only focusing on
84:04 - replacing this congenital hearing loss
84:06 - but still it can help the other patient
84:09 - also by doing some internal
84:11 - customization in a
84:12 - hardw I think hopefully he answer your
84:14 - question there who in the chat here
84:16 - talking about your brother backyard
84:17 - creators judges please I think the
84:20 - science is a bit more complicated than I
84:21 - can for you a link in the Des you can
84:25 - read the full proposals if you want more
84:27 - information on how it
84:28 - works that one was cool again it's it's
84:31 - hard to see the value when like I can
84:33 - hear right I don't know what it's like
84:36 - to to be deaf or to know someone like
84:38 - that but very interesting if it actually
84:42 - would allow someone to hear like a full
84:43 - sentence I get that you can hear noises
84:45 - pleas welcome but I'm curious if you can
84:47 - make out words if You' actually have
84:49 - legit
84:51 - communication they can move towards that
84:53 - this is massive especially in Asia where
84:55 - you can't like a $15,000 implant that's
84:59 - massive you sell something for like 600
85:01 - $900 yeah Irving uh from the chat have a
85:04 - look at the the link in the description
85:05 - there there's some more information I
85:07 - think you could also probably just look
85:08 - up their their project we'll see but
85:11 - that's quite cool okay what are we on
85:16 - now what was the most Mo the disruptive
85:19 - electronic technology there you go that
85:21 - you guys witnessed in the last few
85:24 - years any
85:26 - guesses so by end of this presentation
85:29 - I'll convince you our technology wire
85:32 - fits the bill for such a let's look at
85:34 - the funding on these guys this one's
85:35 - kind of crazy 10 million
85:37 - usies to send High speeed data through
85:41 - human skin hi I'm perer I'm head of
85:44 - partnership for aana and let's talk
85:47 - about the magic of
85:50 - wi it's like a new Wi-Fi protocol guys
85:53 - or I guess implementation I'm not sure
85:56 - if you
85:58 - uh sorry so if you think about um a
86:03 - technology that can increase the battery
86:06 - life of devices let's say headphone from
86:08 - 4 hours to 20 hours what will be the
86:11 - impact on the E-Waste that batteries
86:15 - generate so our technology because it's
86:18 - 100 times more efficient than Bluetooth
86:20 - and Wi-Fi can essentially achieve their
86:23 - target
86:25 - really how much usage does Wi-Fi have
86:28 - our technology because it's more
86:30 - efficient can allow smaller form factor
86:33 - for the devices which actually reduces
86:37 - uh plastic waste also the technology
86:40 - because it's more efficient we can have
86:43 - devices that can be virtually charging
86:45 - free or in some cases they need smaller
86:48 - battery and that helps the environment
86:50 - and that is good for mother
86:56 - Earth
86:58 - now uh what is wire so you can think of
87:01 - it as um electronic analog of a nerve
87:06 - how we actually send the data from our
87:08 - brain to our different senses now if you
87:12 - think about a human body we have one
87:14 - processor and we have uh several senses
87:17 - but if you think about uh all the
87:19 - devices all around our uh physical
87:22 - system like Smartwatch you have a phone
87:24 - you have XR VR devices they all each
87:27 - have a processor there now they have
87:29 - multiple brains so why do we need that
87:32 - because the speed between the devices is
87:34 - currently slow and also it's not very
87:36 - power eff efficient however with our
87:39 - technology which is 100 times more
87:41 - efficient than Bluetooth and Wi-Fi we
87:43 - can change that Paradigm and bring about
87:46 - distributed computing architecture that
87:48 - will make the size of those uh devices
87:52 - much much
87:54 - smaller
87:56 - wow now so what communicate with is a
88:00 - new communication technology that allows
88:03 - us to send data along any surface for
88:07 - example human skin really now
88:10 - imagine I have a headphone and and my
88:14 - friend who has a headphone also uh is
88:17 - listening to music through a streaming
88:19 - through let's say a smartphone if I I
88:22 - touch that person or I come near that
88:24 - now I can listen to the same music that
88:28 - is a science fiction and but this is
88:31 - there's no way that's anymore through
88:32 - our wire technology okay I need to try
88:34 - that I need reality hope I hope they
88:36 - have that in Demon this okay I'm going
88:38 - to check that out after guys I'm going
88:39 - to I'll post an Instagram story or
88:41 - something that's crazy if that actually
88:42 - works now if you think about how uh
88:45 - let's say I just like touch someone's
88:47 - hand you can hear the song they're
88:48 - listening to way head through Bluetooth
88:51 - I guess you have
88:52 - [Music]
88:54 - and so only very small amount of energy
88:56 - is actually being converted to send the
88:59 - data however our technology through yr
89:02 - chip we actually conf find the data
89:05 - around a bubble around our body which
89:07 - means we need very less amount of energy
89:10 - so intuitively you can think of why we
89:11 - are more efficient compared to Wi-Fi and
89:16 - Bluetooth now this is not a chart this
89:19 - is an actual data test on our production
89:22 - chip our chip is already uh
89:25 - commercialized that gives 100 times more
89:28 - energy now think about it think about
89:31 - any field when was the last time you
89:33 - heard about 100 times Improvement in
89:37 - efficiency G almost never happens
89:40 - especially in
89:42 - technology so we launched our chip just
89:46 - nine months ago at CES in 2023 we
89:49 - received best NCS award wow right at
89:52 - that event couple million contract from
89:55 - some customers and till this date we
89:58 - have closed $7.5 Million worth of
90:00 - contracts in just last N9 months have a
90:02 - ton of sales for
90:04 - that smartphone companies device
90:06 - manufacturers in us and all around the
90:09 - world are either evaluating our
90:11 - technology or in the process of uh
90:14 - integrating into next generation of
90:15 - devices and we are fairly confident
90:18 - you'll see a device powered by our
90:20 - technology in
90:22 - 2024 I'm curious if that means you have
90:24 - to change a bunch of stuff from the
90:25 - develop perspective building a smart
90:27 - class hopefully not see that will
90:29 - increase the Barry Life For That device
90:32 - from 2 hours to 12 hours so that's a
90:35 - huge huge uh uh Barry uh bar
90:42 - love so uh this company has uh
90:47 - investment from Samsung uh Ro who
90:50 - actually brought the Bluetooth the
90:51 - market Market is also part of the
90:53 - investment team uh Tony Chi who invented
90:55 - Google Glass is also an investor holens
90:58 - team if which understand the problem
91:00 - with the weight and the heat associated
91:02 - with those XR and VR devices we can
91:04 - actually address those problems wow this
91:07 - one's cool guys it's probably one of my
91:08 - favorite ones so far this is a little
91:11 - what that demonstrates what is
91:12 - this communicate with touch let's see
91:15 - [Music]
91:20 - this
91:31 - guys if that actually works like that's
91:33 - crazy okay let me I need to try that
91:40 - after how that's so okay that's really
91:49 - cool that was a good marketing video
91:51 - they have there yeah thank you and if
91:52 - you have any questions please talk to us
91:55 - I have the demo there if you want to
91:56 - partner with us I would love to have a
91:58 - conversation with you guys thank you
92:00 - team you have can I touch you and you
92:02 - subscribe to my channel
92:05 - Jud uh yeah uh actually I have met you
92:09 - uh during the mwc oh okay yeah and uh my
92:13 - question is that how about the cost
92:16 - compared with the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
92:20 - this is a premium product it's more
92:22 - expensive giving 100 times performance
92:25 - schem so that's about to be
92:27 - expected thank you he didn't say the
92:30 - cost though but it's a lot more
92:32 - expensive interest um are these mostly
92:35 - from wearables from reducing borri
92:37 - perspective on how do you what are the
92:39 - sort of most use cases you're getting
92:41 - bount interest for at this point yeah
92:44 - I'll give you an example there's a
92:45 - medical company which is like they have
92:47 - this device for continuous glucose
92:49 - monitoring so they have to charge it for
92:51 - every three
92:52 - uh 3 days or 7 days something like that
92:55 - because our par consumption is so low we
92:57 - don't need charging for it anymore we
92:58 - can just stick in a small cell battery
93:00 - that'll just power it for a year so that
93:03 - just changes the game tremendously yeah
93:05 - no charging for gluc if you look at all
93:07 - the devices uh XR VR and those
93:10 - devices because we are doing the compute
93:12 - on those devices but if you can offload
93:15 - that compute to a smartphone which
93:16 - everybody carries the weight of the
93:18 - devices will go down the only reason it
93:20 - can be done is there's a highspeed
93:22 - connectivity in those devices and a
93:24 - smartphone so basically it's a
93:25 - distributed computing architecture that
93:27 - actually changes the game now for examp
93:29 - both the smartphone and the device need
93:31 - smart helmet uh they had a camera in the
93:34 - helmet and this was for industrial use
93:36 - case and they were wanting to run AI on
93:38 - the uh the on the vision the computer
93:40 - data that they were gathering through
93:41 - the uh camera but the weight of the
93:45 - helmet became twice the workers said we
93:47 - can't wear it because it's a giant
93:49 - battery you're carrying on a house when
93:51 - they used our technology we just only
93:53 - the weight increase by few grams so and
93:55 - also they don't have to have a uh very
93:59 - uh complex Electronics because it has
94:00 - just a camera and our board and rest of
94:03 - the processing is happening on a
94:04 - standard Android op phone for example so
94:08 - it just changes the game tremendously so
94:10 - that's why this is we feel it is one of
94:12 - the most disruptive technology and we
94:15 - believe that it's going to end up in
94:16 - your smartphones for next uh even if it
94:19 - is expensive that's still like if one
94:20 - smartphone has
94:23 - thank you for your fantastic
94:24 - presentation I am curious to
94:27 - see how much more expensive actually is
94:29 - lower energy y connect lower but how
94:32 - much more expensive and media friends
94:34 - please vote via the media Choice link
94:36 - thank you guys that's that's a cool one
94:39 - I really want to try that I want to see
94:41 - the like the music things I mean that's
94:43 - kind of more of a novelty right like you
94:45 - really need to do that no but um that's
94:48 - really really interesting I'll try to
94:50 - post something uh
94:52 - and at least I'm going to have a travel
94:53 - Vlog coming out soon I'll I'll put in
94:55 - that something about this presentation
94:57 - or some of the other ones some of other
94:59 - demos cuz there's quite a few really
95:00 - cool ones there I think we're going to
95:02 - break
95:03 - shortly um let's see what are we what
95:06 - are we on right now
95:10 - eight I have a whole schedule here so
95:13 - much teams and that was an invigorating
95:15 - morning of we have aak thanks to all our
95:18 - first eight teams so now it is time for
95:21 - a well earned break for everyone so we
95:24 - have te break for all of you outside
95:27 - please do enjoy them and return at 3:45
95:31 - p.m. 3:45 p.m. sharp thank you so much
95:35 - and I'll see all of you later thank
95:38 - you okay guys so let's go to the chat
95:40 - now um let's talk about some of the
95:43 - presentations also I want to hear your
95:44 - comments if you guys have anything to
95:45 - say put it in the chat I'm going to be
95:47 - focusing on just reading chat and
95:49 - responding to that let me turn down the
95:50 - music
95:52 - actually it's not too loud I think
95:53 - that's fine if it's too loud guys let me
95:54 - know but yeah this is in Singapore guys
95:57 - I'm here right now uh like this is right
95:58 - outside I have a bunch of footage of it
96:00 - um I can't show you where I am cuz the
96:02 - camera is set up but it's right
96:05 - outside okay chat what are you guys
96:09 - saying uh I had a glucose monitor
96:12 - changeed my life is type one it'd be
96:14 - nice to have it just part of a smoke
96:15 - phone yeah I don't know if it'd be just
96:16 - part of a smartphone but I think the
96:17 - idea is that it'd be a lot lighter and
96:20 - you don't need to charge it anymore you
96:21 - imagine like you don't need to charge
96:23 - the monitor like it just works forever
96:25 - or for a year or two years and you just
96:26 - swap it the battery I think that's the
96:28 - big thing even the example he was
96:30 - talking about with the helmet there
96:31 - where like you don't need to have a 10
96:33 - lb battery in your helmet you make it a
96:35 - few
96:36 - grams uh hi everyone just got home from
96:39 - work hi Tim hey guys thanks for tuning
96:40 - into the stream have any questions let
96:42 - me know um obviously this will be
96:45 - available on YouTube after for you guys
96:46 - to watch what do you think about the
96:48 - invention in Android phone industry in
96:49 - The Last 5 Years uh inventions it's
96:53 - crazy I mean Android is yeah I like dude
96:57 - just technology in general 5 years it
97:00 - it's been crazy the kind of stuff that
97:02 - we've seen think about it the internet
97:03 - wasn't even really around what 20 25
97:05 - years ago and look what we have now hey
97:07 - Tim I want some project ideas for my
97:10 - college I wants to make something unique
97:11 - Innovative product development related
97:13 - to software Ai and ml we keep watching
97:14 - this then because you've already seen
97:17 - all the Innovative stuff they have
97:18 - obviously you're not going to be able to
97:19 - do something to this level I mean these
97:20 - are startups with expert level teams PhD
97:23 - doctorates you know sometimes in one
97:26 - case $300 million in funding
97:30 - um yeah I don't know what you would want
97:32 - to do for AI and ml there's a lot of
97:34 - cool computer vision stuff I really like
97:36 - doing the visual type of applications
97:38 - even hence you've seen some of these
97:40 - presentations like the visually
97:41 - captivating ones are always interesting
97:43 - do I work for Oppo no I've just
97:45 - partnered with them they actually
97:46 - brought me here to Singapore I've been
97:47 - working with the team uh to live stream
97:49 - this event I'm going to be here tomorrow
97:51 - as well they're releasing a new
97:52 - smartphone I don't know how much I can
97:54 - share about that but I'm going to have a
97:56 - video out soon that's going to share my
97:57 - whole kind of travel journey to
97:59 - Singapore it's my first time in Asia
98:01 - here and um yeah you guys are going to
98:03 - see the real Tim traveling around not
98:06 - just sitting at an office this has been
98:08 - such a cool opportunity though and then
98:10 - obviously this event is sweet get to
98:12 - meet all these people here and I'm like
98:14 - the little celebrity in in the live
98:15 - stream room which is funny uh what else
98:17 - you guys say here well many monitors I
98:20 - use after week I'm not sure the
98:21 - difference I guess I missed most of that
98:23 - presentation yeah so these monitors uh
98:26 - in terms of the battery life it's saying
98:28 - I don't know I think it's like the
98:29 - plugin thing just the actual monitoring
98:33 - I don't know chip you don't need to
98:34 - charge anymore is what they're saying
98:37 - I'm just hearing of Oppo Oppo is a
98:38 - massive smartphone brand in Asia guys
98:41 - it's not really big in US and Canada I
98:43 - think they have some subsidiary
98:44 - companies that they own but it's not uh
98:46 - it's not so big over there but in Asia
98:48 - this is massive I mean like what they
98:51 - gave me like a little Oppo like tablet
98:53 - type thing here that I've been using to
98:54 - read some of the live chat and it's a
98:56 - pretty affordable brand from what I've
98:58 - been able to tell and uh they have this
99:00 - cool like kind of fold phone and again I
99:03 - don't know how much I can talk with that
99:04 - so be careful but yeah uh the gaming
99:07 - industry is booming all the world I have
99:09 - gears for racing use Python s
99:11 - cheaper okay I'm not sure what you're
99:13 - saying there what else have you guys
99:17 - asked hey guys let me know what you
99:19 - think of this so far kind of you know a
99:20 - new thing for the channel but this has
99:22 - been really fun just to sit back and
99:24 - just comment on
99:28 - these how to Vision a plan for college
99:31 - project research so I won't waste time I
99:33 - think you have to validate an idea right
99:35 - I think a lot of these companies what
99:36 - they've done well is that they actually
99:38 - have a bunch of users people that are
99:40 - actually interested in their product and
99:41 - they very quickly validate what do they
99:43 - want what do they not want rather than
99:45 - building something or working on
99:46 - something that no one wants you got to
99:48 - figure out very quickly does someone
99:50 - actually want this this has been really
99:52 - interesting yeah I think so as well
99:53 - again a new thing on the channel but I
99:56 - hope you guys are enjoying it we've got
99:58 - another seven seven presentations seven
100:01 - or eight presentations after the break
100:03 - some more really interesting ones um
100:05 - that are coming up so far I'll say like
100:08 - the coolest one for me is still that
100:10 - haptic one guys the demo is just
100:13 - honestly it was really impressive cuz I
100:15 - thought it was going to be a new type of
100:16 - sensor like a proprietary controller but
100:18 - it's not like it's the same Tech that
100:20 - you guys have right now in your pocket
100:22 - but it feels immersive like it's almost
100:24 - like they just threw in like a subwoofer
100:25 - in a surround sound system and I feel
100:28 - like I can experience the audio uh they
100:31 - gave me a VR headset and they gave me
100:33 - like a controller and on a screen it was
100:35 - like this what do you call it like a
100:37 - bunch of cars for example and you can
100:39 - feel the gear change you can feel um all
100:42 - the revs really cool someone's from
100:44 - crotia here nice man uh how can I solo
100:47 - project to all over the world I don't
100:50 - know what you mean there
100:51 - when will we have a generative AI for 3D
100:53 - modeling so there's actually a 3D
100:55 - project coming up a really cool camera
100:59 - kind of 3D project let me see I have a
101:01 - little notes thing here I'll read
101:02 - through some of them 3D interactive
101:04 - platform haptic Solutions we already saw
101:06 - that one biobased solutions for flexible
101:08 - Electronics contactless Health
101:10 - monitoring eco-friendly packaging for
101:12 - Oppo smartphones the online therapy easy
101:15 - speech Flint paper battery was another
101:17 - big one too they're super early but the
101:20 - that was interesting impulse
101:22 - non-surgical hearing aid actually we've
101:24 - seen a lot of these how many more do we
101:26 - have I think we've already seen maybe 10
101:27 - of them project eight yeah we've already
101:30 - seen
101:31 - eight oh no we've seen eight
101:35 - okay um mind mind lacks Health
101:39 - technology orbit Precision
101:42 - psychiatrics Psychiatry sorry at scale
101:45 - Sky light Define the Next Generation
101:47 - displays woa we got a bunch of cool ones
101:50 - coming up guys
101:51 - let's see what you're saying
101:53 - [Music]
101:55 - here uh what is your suggestion for a
101:58 - somewhat beginner student who also wants
101:59 - to do what they're doing like what
102:01 - language do I start learning in Concepts
102:04 - like from a development perspective it
102:06 - depends what you want to build I always
102:07 - say figure out what it is you actually
102:09 - want to make first and then pick the
102:12 - Technology based on that but as a
102:13 - beginner you might want to start out
102:14 - with something simple right Python and
102:16 - JavaScript is usually what I recommend I
102:18 - find nowadays there's more applications
102:20 - of Ja script python is still fantastic
102:22 - don't get me wrong but you might not be
102:26 - able to build as many visually
102:28 - captivating applications or full
102:30 - applications as you can with JavaScript
102:32 - so I usually recommend JavaScript uh
102:34 - what do you think about information
102:35 - Integrity how can we prevent fake news
102:36 - images by AI that's interesting I I've
102:39 - they don't have anything like that in
102:41 - this um
102:43 - presentation but it's tough right like
102:45 - how do you monitor AI generated
102:47 - content I don't know unfortunately I
102:49 - don't know I don't really have a strong
102:50 - opinion opinion on that I don't want to
102:51 - speak out of my expertise here have you
102:54 - ever done any data engineering data
102:55 - science projects a few I mean I I messed
102:57 - around with some like Co tracking
102:59 - projects and whatnot during uh you know
103:01 - during all
103:02 - that guys I like just like building
103:05 - stuff I like building games things you
103:07 - can interact with data modeling is is
103:09 - interesting to interact with but not
103:10 - necessarily to build it's a whole
103:12 - different skill set too right with all
103:13 - the data sence stuff just learn to
103:17 - research and read yourself yeah of
103:19 - course like you have to be you have to
103:20 - always critically think right don't
103:21 - believe what you see which is
103:23 - unfortunate but that's how it
103:24 - is do you know anything to uh to help LM
103:27 - be more reliable and truthful I actually
103:29 - post a video or I'm going to post one
103:30 - soon about something called rag
103:32 - retrieval augmented generation really
103:34 - interesting Tech that can essentially
103:36 - Define the source of where information
103:38 - is coming from so if you get an answer
103:41 - it can actually tell you this is why I
103:43 - came up with the answer this is where I
103:45 - got it from and then you can go back and
103:47 - validate that it's called rag uh stay
103:49 - tuned I'm going to post a video on that
103:50 - there next few weeks so llms that's a
103:53 - huge application essentially it allows
103:55 - you to inject real-time data or to
103:57 - provide the data source that a rag will
103:59 - or rag an llm will reason on website for
104:02 - rag just look it up it's being uh
104:05 - heavily invested in by like Amazon and
104:07 - like other big companies yeah retrieval
104:10 - augmented generation it's kind of a
104:11 - protocol more so than like a library but
104:14 - you can do it with something like Lang
104:16 - chain for example if you guys know what
104:17 - that is python Library JavaScript as

104:37 - few minutes do you think Russ can
104:39 - replace C++ I don't know about replace
104:43 - maybe I think it will replace in some
104:45 - applications but not all right so much
104:47 - stuff is built in C++ like are you going
104:49 - to rewrite all of it and run rust
104:51 - probably not so you're still going to
104:52 - need C++ but for new applications
104:54 - embedded systems lowle Hardware I think
104:56 - rust is huge I do want to eventually
104:58 - continue that series guys but I don't
105:01 - know It's just tough to find time to

106:40 - speaker and it just goes in between the
106:41 - device I don't know how that works
106:43 - though because how does the device just
106:44 - pick that up and connect to that they
106:47 - might have like a pretty specialized

108:54 - no one wants to do that and the straw
108:56 - the straw one guys let me find the exact
108:58 - name of that but that was the
109:01 - uh that was the $300 million one that
109:05 - what is that called I guess a biobased
109:07 - solution for flexible
109:10 - Electronics let me find the actual name
109:12 - of
109:18 - that no it's not in this one

110:08 - feel like low code is already replacing
110:10 - it I wouldn't say so low code is like
110:12 - augmenting it helping it but I can tell
110:14 - you like sometimes it's faster just to
110:16 - build it without low code low code is a
110:19 - tool but you still need to know front
110:20 - and a back end to utilize it like the
110:22 - best people to use low code no front and
110:24 - a back end right just like the best
110:25 - people to use Chach BT no development

115:41 - 1,000 backers with the commitment of 21
115:45 - days risk-free refund our return rate is
115:49 - just as low low as
115:51 - 1.3% pretty good for % of of our users
115:55 - report it is so effective for them and
115:58 - the similar results showed us in our
116:01 - clinical trials but just put aside these
116:04 - numbers we also receive many valuable
116:07 - comments and feedbacks from our users I
116:10 - remember one of our user called Nal he
116:13 - experienced more than 30 years of
116:16 - insomnia usually he took one two three
116:19 - hours to fall asleep but with us the
116:22 - second day using our product it takes
116:25 - him just 10 minutes it's impressive very
116:27 - grateful to meet us and we are very
116:30 - happy to help them like like
116:33 - natural so this year we will
116:35 - continuously promoting manx as a global
116:38 - brand through our direct to customer
116:41 - sales channels like Amazon online our
116:44 - available our product is already
116:46 - available on the Amazon and you can
116:48 - search Google go for that and we expect
116:52 - we can receive $1.5 million US dollar
116:55 - revenues at the end projected Revenue
116:57 - okay I want only that right now and
117:00 - another memorable feedback from our user
117:02 - is from try and she said your product is
117:05 - just like a electronic Voodoo for me
117:09 - suggesting that our product is so
117:11 - magical is it true to some exent because
117:14 - with no speakers or Webers inside we use
117:18 - our self develop tactile conduction
117:21 - material to generate sound and
117:23 - vibrations wonder if you actually feel
117:25 - that material we have our encoding
117:28 - algorithm to generate the frequencies
117:31 - and then transmit the signals to the
117:34 - brain to have the nerve regulation and
117:37 - on this technology we obtained seven
117:40 - global patterns and 52 software
117:43 - copyrights and we are proud to say in
117:46 - this field of Technology we found no
117:48 - computer competitors in the world for
117:51 - now really we are here today because we
117:55 - do want to collaborate with opal to
117:58 - promote manlike Tech with greater good
118:02 - uh there are two possible synergies the
118:05 - first one is with opal Health uh we
118:08 - could collaborate with them with the
118:11 - monitoring variables and to provide the
118:14 - personal health intervention with our
118:16 - manlike sleeping mat thus to have a
118:19 - close Loop for uh the opal sleep
118:23 - users another cooperation could be in
118:26 - the all smart devices in opal because
118:30 - the core technology of us is the
118:32 - immersive tactile auditory B feedback
118:36 - modules and it can be applied in many
118:39 - scenarios like currently we have the
118:41 - application in smart cars currently we
118:44 - have the proof of concept contract with
118:46 - Ali and Le Auto already in China
118:51 - hence this it's on Kickstarter guys I
118:53 - think I don't know if it's available yet
118:56 - the magic of this experience could be
118:58 - you can not only experience the sense of
119:01 - touch but you can feel the emotions
119:04 - imagine when you watch you are watching
119:07 - a horror movie and you can feel more
119:09 - afraid and excited I don't know if I
119:12 - want
119:13 - that modules inside feel a little bit
119:17 - interesting and just try the
119:21 - so this product and technology is solely
119:24 - created by our
119:26 - interdisciplinary team and Industry
119:29 - experts naming from Neuroscience sleep
119:32 - medicine materials B sensors psychology
119:36 - and public health and we all determined
119:39 - to make better products for all our
119:42 - users so the last but not the least our
119:45 - mlik value we firmly believe self-care
119:49 - it's not just Health Care not just
119:52 - healing but preventive medicine so we
119:55 - will continuously using our us Centric
119:58 - humanized experience to
120:01 - promote sty for all of our users so last
120:05 - and we wish every of you could sleep
120:08 - smarter and rest in powered thank you so
120:11 - much thank you team good uh I want to go
120:14 - try that one out I guess you just lie I
120:16 - wonder how much you actually feel like
120:19 - is it vibrating you or is it just like
120:21 - doing something in the muscles that
120:22 - helps you relax someone falling as sleep
120:24 - in 10 minutes after like 2 hours pretty
120:26 - impressive your product help a person
120:29 - that uh easily get to sleep in one hour
120:33 - so what's the next step how how to
120:36 - improve your product maybe um lesser
120:39 - time for sleep or any other way yeah uh
120:43 - thank you for your question so we our
120:45 - product usually uh help our uh uh uh
120:48 - users to get to sleep in 10
120:51 - minutes we actually uh did a lot of uh
120:54 - seat users and testing um before and 90%
120:58 - of them reported the same uh similar
121:00 - effect and also we have done our
121:02 - clinical Trails uh in uh uh Jang
121:05 - University in China and uh we with the
121:09 - clinical tral shows that we de uh the
121:11 - decrease the uh time to fall asleep by
121:15 - 15% of all the trial members and
121:18 - increase uh the time uh the time to
121:20 - maintain deep sleep by 20% of all the of
121:24 - the pallet uh users so that's 15 20%
121:28 - would you guys pay that much for that
121:30 - let me know what you think we also plan
121:31 - to obtain the FDA approval uh uh the
121:37 - would you guys pay that much money for
121:38 - for 15 20% like time to fall as honest
121:42 - our product to sellon we don't really
121:45 - need this uh uh uh medical certificate
121:48 - yeah Fair
121:51 - than never you wouldn't pay that I feel
121:53 - like if you have that forever sleep is
121:55 - pretty important right stimulation for
121:57 - Sleep Disorders um bring the table is
122:01 - also a a haptic solution um your haptic
122:04 - solution I guess Targets this
122:05 - displacement and frequency for the
122:07 - stimulation would you say that that's a
122:09 - core part of your strategic advantage or
122:12 - are there other strategic advantages
122:13 - within your product guys I think Tim is
122:16 - running the judge panel here like you
122:17 - said like the core technology is a
122:20 - heptic we also said it's a tactile uh
122:23 - nerve system because that's a
122:25 - fundamental and the most uh uh uh uh uh
122:28 - the most uh uh uh sensory that transmit
122:32 - most of the information to our brand so
122:34 - we use the tacal but in the meantime we
122:37 - also have the sound um like the auditory
122:40 - sensory uh to uh cooperate with a a
122:44 - tactile sensory to transmit to the
122:46 - signal to the uh uh to the brain and to
122:48 - have the nerve regulation and in the
122:50 - future we will also have other sensories
122:54 - uh because we will have the uh different
122:56 - uh models and like we will have uh like
123:00 - the sense and other sense sensories to
123:03 - increase our Effectiveness thank you
123:06 - thank you be curious what they can get
123:08 - to because propal 15 to 20 or even
123:11 - 25% that's important I guess but that go
123:14 - like an hour to 45 minutes is that a
123:16 - notable difference if it was an hour to
123:18 - 10 minutes
123:19 - which it did for some people that's a
123:21 - big big a bigger difference story but if
123:23 - the average person is getting a small
123:25 - benefit I don't know how impactful that
123:27 - actually is but I mean if you if you
123:30 - think of it right you're sleeping every
123:31 - single night to get an extra 30 minutes
123:33 - of sleep every night or even 1550
123:35 - minutes of sleep every night that's
123:37 - probably a pretty decent return on
123:38 - investment in terms of your health I
123:40 - guess it does depend on your lifestyle
123:42 - also like if you're travel you going to
123:43 - bring this with you or you going to
123:45 - leave this just your in from us with
123:48 - their they should make like a mattress
123:50 - that'd be sick if they had that that
123:52 - that had the tech right in the
123:54 - mattress music so it has sound as well
123:57 - but what if people use it and never fall
123:59 - asleep without it that's actually a
124:01 - really good point if you become reliant
124:03 - on that and then you need that you don't
124:05 - is the Pioneer of a 3D tracking
124:07 - technology this is so cool I this demo
124:10 - we don't often realize it but from the
124:11 - moment we wake up we're instinctively
124:13 - measuring tracking and adjusting to the
124:15 - 3D environments around us even a simple
124:17 - Act of grabing handle is in truth a
124:19 - highly sophisticated 3D
124:21 - interactions now as we try to make
124:23 - machines and robots work in a similar
124:25 - way the need and the requirements for 3D
124:27 - tracking has evolved as well the problem
124:30 - is the Legacy Solutions cannot keep up
124:33 - they're Limited in customization are
124:35 - complicated to use and are very
124:37 - expensive to dive a little deeper there
124:40 - has been duly in 3D tracking first came
124:43 - Optical using cameras and lasers it's
124:46 - very intuitive but what it cannot see it
124:48 - cannot track so you must have line of
124:50 - sight to overcome this em system was
124:52 - introduced in 1960s no line of sight is
124:55 - needed because magnetic magnetic field
124:57 - can pass through materials but metals
124:59 - can cause Distortion and loss in
125:01 - Precision so for decades this has caused
125:04 - as a time money and even lives in some
125:07 - cases so we decided to create a
125:09 - completely new approach a streamlined
125:11 - system made of just two main components
125:13 - the base station and sensors that is
125:15 - ultra precise that is hassle-free to use
125:18 - our magic is a permanent magnet which
125:20 - allows us to overcome the old
125:23 - limitations with the unique advantages
125:25 - of our own that you won't find anywhere
125:27 - else all combined we're cheaper simpler
125:31 - yet have better performance than
125:32 - anything in the market wow and you don't
125:35 - have to just take my word for it our
125:37 - core patent was granted in just 6 months
125:39 - when a typical us pen takes over two
125:41 - years which shows streng of approach and
125:44 - with the years of know house our
125:45 - technical mode has only
125:47 - grown our primary Market is surgical
125:50 - navigation valued at 8 billion and
125:52 - growing about 14% annually where we
125:54 - partner with the medical device
125:56 - companies across surgical segments let's
125:58 - see one of the
126:00 - examples you can see the base station
126:02 - next to the patient's head creating a
126:04 - tracking Zone and we've attach the
126:05 - sensor one of them to the dro and one to
126:07 - the patient and with just two sensors
126:10 - you have a fully digitized dental
126:12 - implant procedure that's fast reliable
126:14 - and accessible that it's like a simple
126:16 - game that anybody can do and why stop
126:19 - there replace the hand with the robot
126:21 - and you can take full advantage of up to
126:22 - 0.1 mm Precision that we can provide and
126:25 - even automate the
126:28 - process our business model is B2B razor
126:31 - and blade base station is the main
126:33 - Hardware while millions of sensors are
126:34 - sold as peripherals and disposables from
126:37 - simple catheters to surgical robots from
126:40 - neural to dental to Orthopedics the
126:42 - applications are incredibly
126:45 - diverse but medical is difficult so we
126:48 - form strategic partnership first in
126:50 - surgical navigation second in dental
126:52 - implants we launched the pilot program
126:55 - in 2021 and so far accumulated over
126:57 - 1,300 orders worth more than $10
127:00 - million oh we also had a revelation
127:02 - that's a lot we are a lot of our
127:05 - customers coming up from low-income
127:07 - Emerging Markets with a rapidly aging
127:10 - populations we're talking billions with
127:12 - no access to timely surgical care
127:14 - millions of preventable deaths and three
127:16 - times the higher mortality rate post
127:18 - surgery
127:19 - compared to high incum naations they
127:21 - desperately need safe affordable And
127:23 - Timely surgical care and that's where we
127:26 - come in our Best in Class 3D tracking
127:28 - enables more targeted therefore safer
127:30 - operations and we do it while saving up
127:32 - to 90% in cost and hours of critical
127:35 - medical time which can save countless
127:37 - lives guys what this does is track
127:39 - really tiny sensors the base station is
127:42 - the product path to grow reach your full
127:44 - potential and thankfully in our current
127:46 - partner Network we can count about
127:47 - 10,000 Hospital hits with up to $150
127:50 - million of annual recurring Revenue
127:52 - potential wow they give them a huge
127:53 - valuation because we are not providing
127:55 - the end user user Medical Products
127:57 - ourselves we can enter the market even
127:59 - faster they've raised 8.25 million USD
128:02 - exciting is the growing and
128:03 - interconnected I'll show you a a video
128:04 - at some point if possible did the demo
128:07 - it's crazy how accurate is guide the
128:09 - robots and
128:10 - automations make training and simulation
128:12 - and immersive and make everything
128:14 - digital for everyone 3D tracking has a
128:17 - role to play in nearly all Industries
128:19 - and omo is at the center of it this is
128:22 - just like enhanced 3D track just better
128:24 - interesting would be our vision to make
128:26 - digital interactions more human and
128:28 - effortless the precise Dynamic and
128:31 - unambiguous data that we generate are
128:33 - the building blocks of a data driven
128:35 - digital interaction platform for
128:37 - Enterprise
128:38 - workflows and even consumer
128:41 - entertainment oh that would be single
128:44 - device yeah I want that in my uh my
128:46 - years ago when two immigrants met in San
128:49 - Francisco and since then we have created
128:51 - a fullstack team that is uniquely
128:53 - capable of perfecting this technology
128:55 - with the years or Decades of experience
128:57 - in their respective fields from Material
128:59 - Science can you guys imagine inventing
129:00 - this and building this like the Geniuses
129:03 - that do that that's wild thanks to all
129:04 - the progresses that we made we recently
129:06 - raised a pre AR round LED by the two
129:08 - strategic Partners who are
129:10 - obviously 3D tracking our goal is to
129:14 - fulfill existing demand achieve mass
129:16 - production Readiness and expand to other
129:21 - verticals I mentioned at the beginning
129:23 - the simple Act of grabbing a handle with
129:26 - you and opa's help we can open the door
129:28 - of the digital transformation at a
129:30 - global scale for everyone everywhere and
129:33 - truly be an inspiration for people thank
129:36 - you good
129:38 - presentation well you guys said you
129:39 - don't quite understand it for QA I think
129:42 - it's cuz I've seen the demo I understand
129:43 - it better they I wish they would just do
129:46 - the demo on stage it'd be a lot more
129:47 - impactful than the whole slide deck but
129:49 - I guess they need to do the whole
129:50 - keynote thing let's see what they ask
129:52 - them here where's Tim with the
129:53 - questional angle with OP product uh so I
129:58 - showed three different slides I think it
130:00 - ended with a single device you know
130:02 - mobile device that you can use to
130:04 - interact in digital environment if you
130:06 - will I think that's the end goal if you
130:08 - will um but as you've seen from the
130:10 - chart that expanded outwards there are
130:12 - multiple intermediate steps that we can
130:15 - take to get there robotics automation
130:18 - manufacturing training simulation all
130:21 - these are areas where having a really
130:23 - precise tracking in in 3D can really
130:27 - benefit in ways that you might you might
130:29 - not even know right now so I would like
130:31 - to explore those potential but
130:34 - ultimately I want to get to the end goal
130:38 - yeah let's see Tim with
130:41 - question what is the cost ofation versus
130:45 - EMF that's the incumbent industry you
130:48 - EMF yeah yeah uh so the market Standard
130:51 - right now is a company called ndi from
130:53 - Canada and their unit purchased in
130:55 - between 20 to $30,000 wow anywhere in
130:59 - the world basically uh but it's very it
131:01 - takes a very long time to actually
131:03 - receive it because their capacity is
131:05 - pretty limited our device we originally
131:07 - started the company wanting to enter
131:09 - into consumer VR we didn't see the
131:11 - potential uh so it's cheap let's see how
131:14 - much it cost Medical in between um so we
131:17 - originally wanted theice to be extremely
131:20 - affordable which means like
131:22 - ,00 oh right now we can actually
131:25 - manufacture at 300 or less so
131:30 - sell 700 many times more than that we
131:34 - still have a lot of room to play with I
131:36 - say wow so guys this is like a little
131:38 - pod thing like you could buy this cuz
131:40 - they said they want to use for VR some
131:43 - of the big concerns in manufacturing are
131:45 - repeatability reproducibility and in the
131:47 - product you have concerns like Edge case
131:50 - failures um these can have big impacts
131:52 - on lives are these areas that you think
131:54 - you can stand out uh from your
131:56 - competitors are these areas where you've
131:58 - had enough production that you can kind
132:00 - of understand uh how you're going to
132:02 - match up to some of the requirements
132:04 - actually that's one of the areas that we
132:07 - love getting questions from so one of
132:09 - the is question we had a lot but one of
132:11 - them is that we never need calibration
132:14 - on site wow so once we calibrate our uh
132:17 - device during the production the users
132:20 - never have to calibrate the device
132:22 - because compability is basically always
132:24 - going to be there so absolute
132:26 - positioning in relations to the base
132:28 - station plus the center uh you don't
132:30 - have to worry about theability
132:33 - yeah
132:37 - damn and yeah Tech with Toby yeah I I
132:39 - was asked to host live
132:41 - stream uh so uh in relative to the total
132:45 - cost of uh Medical instru
132:48 - uh what kind of uh uh percentage or
132:51 - Revenue po potential you looking at uh
132:55 - for this uh
132:57 - Market yeah so the device itself I
132:59 - mentioned that we had a lot of room to
133:01 - play with uh the consumables disposable
133:04 - actually the margins are pretty thin so
133:06 - it's more about the numbers game if you
133:08 - will uh so I think in terms of the
133:11 - margin I can't reveal the exact numbers
133:13 - but you can expect anywhere between 20
133:15 - to even 50% um but there do does exist
133:18 - highend disposable is even so these are
133:21 - maybe you can use it 10 times and then
133:22 - throw it away um those are more
133:25 - expensive and it have a higher margin
133:26 - built in um the interesting thing always
133:29 - with the medical is that there are so
133:30 - many different use cases and variations
133:32 - that you can pursue uh that you
133:34 - basically won't run out of ideas wow
133:38 - yeah just saying you can do really
133:39 - really high Precision 3D tracking of
133:40 - like many types of
133:43 - sensors you can their demo was so cool
133:46 - they had like a little like uh and you
133:48 - just stick it around this like head they
133:50 - kind of showed it there but they had
133:51 - like a real world demo and in real time
133:54 - it was like I mean it's as precise as
133:57 - you could possibly imagine moving in and
133:59 - out and showing you like inside objects
134:02 - cool Unfortunately they are unable to
134:05 - join us today due to an emergency so up
134:08 - next yeah we're skipping one of the
134:09 - presentations our 12 team Sky light from
134:13 - China with their proposal Define the
134:16 - Next Generation displays with perov
134:18 - skite
134:20 - microad nextg displays okay I haven't I
134:23 - haven't seen too much about this they ra
134:24 - three male started in 2023 they're from
134:29 - China right good afternoon ladies and
134:31 - gentlemen I Jing I'm a material
134:33 - scientist from University of Cambridge
134:34 - I'm also the funer and CEO of Skylight
134:37 - today I'm presenting to you guys the
134:38 - Next Generation display using provos Sky
134:42 - micro ever since 30 years ago when
134:44 - liquid Crystal LCD was first adopted uh
134:47 - until 20 years ago old that OED was
134:50 - launched we have never stopped pursuing
134:52 - a brighter a clearer and more color
134:54 - Vivid sort of display and immersive
134:57 - experience but what comes with it is
134:59 - extremely high and increasingly high
135:01 - power consumption that POS a really
135:03 - really high and negative impact on the
135:05 - battery life for the customer but also
135:07 - to our
135:08 - planet so our solution is provos Skai
135:11 - micro solution which is T times more
135:14 - energy efficient than the current LCD
135:16 - and twice as much energy efficient as a
135:19 - olad the key enabler is this material
135:22 - called
135:23 - provos much much Superior performance
135:25 - than the current Quantum doc technology
135:27 - which some of you might recognize has
135:29 - just won the 2023 chemistry Nobel priz
135:32 - the key limitation factor of this
135:34 - material I mean the performance is
135:37 - fantastic but the the problem with this
135:39 - material is extremely unstable it
135:41 - quickly degradates under ambient
135:43 - condition when exposed to water and
135:45 - moist uh moisture and oxygen so we are
135:48 - the research team based in Cambridge cin
135:50 - dig laboratory we spend years of
135:51 - research to come up with a micop porus
135:54 - optical glass to stabilize this
135:57 - material and I'm really really proud to
135:59 - announce at this uh opal inspiration
136:01 - challenge that we are able to stabilize
136:04 - this magic material for more than 10,000
136:07 - hours under ambient conditions what that
136:10 - means is how long is 10,000 hour
136:11 - material in your mobile devices your
136:14 - arvr
136:15 - headsets imposing a very very we call it
136:18 - water oxyer sort of uh anti 46 days
136:22 - layers of continuous us this really
136:23 - opens up this um opportunity for this
136:25 - material to be used
136:28 - in especially in in display uh
136:31 - industry by adopting very similar
136:34 - principle of the in printer or the
136:36 - printer we use in everyone's household
136:38 - we're able to make production of this
136:40 - material extremely scalable we making
136:42 - the Precision of sub pixel down to 0.8
136:45 - Micron so to to give you a perspective
136:47 - active um the late you know uh it is 50
136:51 - times more pixel dense than the written
136:53 - of display we're using our opal phone or
136:56 - other other pads really so we're
136:58 - targeting essentially uh the very big um
137:02 - we call call Commercial display market
137:04 - and also TV market for its Energy
137:06 - Efficiency and we're targeting the micro
137:08 - display for AR and vrs because it's very
137:10 - very bright color yeah it needs to be
137:12 - super precise so small not only are we
137:14 - able to produce a very very strong
137:16 - performance in terms terms of red light
137:18 - blue light and green light combining
137:20 - with in printing technology we're able
137:22 - to make this uh production of this uh
137:24 - display manufacturing really scalable
137:27 - comparing directly with our close
137:28 - competitor we're able to generate more
137:30 - than six times much bright uh brighter
137:32 - this uh red light than our close
137:34 - competitor will have a much much reduced
137:37 - uh prod uh production cost because in
137:39 - printing machine is much cheaper than
137:41 - lithography and also the consumable
137:43 - compos
137:44 - theography so our team combines the
137:47 - experience not um not only combines
137:48 - experience of top talents from un a
137:51 - ghost person with um industry expert we
137:54 - have our CTO fulltime CTO coming from
137:56 - Apple who has been studying and also
137:58 - researching on their
138:00 - latest Pro and we have uh a great
138:03 - combination of material research stup
138:05 - operation and also product
138:08 - designs and also by combining with uh
138:11 - the very vibrant camper ecosystem which
138:13 - is a global headquarter for arm we have
138:15 - the co-founder and Co of arm joining as
138:17 - a strategic advisor but also um a
138:20 - collections of essentially semiconductor
138:23 - manufact fabulous manufacturing
138:24 - Manufacturing Company funders joining us
138:26 - as visors you got a pretty good team
138:28 - there so essentially we have been tested
138:30 - our material and we successfully proved
138:32 - the the the the performance on the
138:34 - commercial display and also the TV
138:35 - display and we have brought our demo
138:37 - with us uh for the micro micro I got to
138:40 - go check that out I didn't look at VR
138:42 - please come and join us uh the T breaks
138:45 - later so as eight months old company
138:48 - we're quickly transitioning um from
138:51 - Pilot stage to the uh from the demo
138:54 - stage to the pilot St by working with
138:56 - indust uh industry leaders in
138:57 - manufacturing and Productions so we're
138:59 - co-developing the technology with kativa
139:02 - the global leader in in printing um um
139:04 - uh in INR printing equipment for OED
139:08 - manufacturing and we have just won the
139:10 - global championship for new display
139:12 - technology challenge organized by Boe
139:14 - the largest display panel manufacturer
139:16 - in China and this pretty legit for 8
139:18 - months it's impressive um not only are
139:21 - we do we want to work with ra million we
139:25 - also working with Magna for much more
139:27 - efficient lighting solution for
139:28 - automobile but also working with Intel
139:31 - to develop a low power consumption chip
139:33 - for uh display
139:36 - solutions by Skylight so we're
139:38 - redefining the uh display technology for
139:41 - mobile phones arvr headsets and also
139:44 - flat panel and also outdoor um display
139:46 - Solutions so like the thing behind him
139:48 - in reshaping the future of visual and
139:50 - action and Computing thank you thank you
139:54 - so much you now have three minutes and
139:55 - 35 seconds for Q&A and he's on time too
139:58 - unlike everyone
140:01 - else let's see Tim before presentation a
140:04 - quick question regarding the uh
140:07 - production so uh how are you at what
140:10 - stage is your technology in terms of the
140:13 - mass production and how do you solve the
140:16 - mass transfer problem for the larger
140:18 - screen uh great question I'll break
140:20 - break that into two folds uh we have
140:22 - just uh established our Global
140:24 - headquarters in sujo industrial park and
140:26 - has we are planning to build our
140:28 - manufacturing capacity from now to 20
140:30 - times more in the next 6 months so we
140:32 - have essentially look up the equipment
140:34 - and also manufacturing facilities in suo
140:37 - industrial park um for Mass transfer
140:39 - techniques so essentially our business
140:40 - model in big TVs and also commercial
140:43 - display is Will Will license all
140:44 - material and also essentially
140:49 - manufacturers and theys have the mass
140:51 - transfer techniques for big display but
140:53 - for small and micro display you don't
140:54 - need the mass transfer techniques so we
140:56 - can make the chips at and modules
140:58 - ourself okay thank you yeah thank
141:05 - you no questions would you say your uh
141:09 - biggest Advantage is the uh material
141:12 - that stabilizes the property of uh uh
141:17 - peros guide yes so we first and we're
141:22 - the first research group in the world to
141:23 - come up with Optical glass and we are
141:26 - also the first group to essentially
141:27 - synthesize and upscale the Productions
141:30 - of this Optical glass so special we
141:33 - first essentially observed this
141:35 - phenomena this fantastic phenomena and
141:37 - because of my background and my
141:38 - co-founders background chemical engineer
141:39 - we we immediately started essentially
141:41 - using a much more chemical engineering
141:43 - processing techniques to essentially
141:45 - upscale the production of this uh
141:47 - material and we the exact reason we're
141:49 - choosing inter printing rather than
141:51 - lithography or other very expensive
141:53 - processing techniques is we have
141:55 - identify because in printer and also in
141:57 - printing technique has been widely
141:59 - commercially available so we're using
142:00 - essentially we D risk our adoption our
142:03 - material um uh in industrialization by
142:06 - adopting more mature
142:07 - technology this guy's killing it this is
142:09 - a great
142:10 - presentation he knows all the answers I
142:12 - don't even have anything to say just
142:13 - listen to this guy talk problems right
142:15 - now that are seeking this solution
142:17 - um in terms of the brightness or other
142:19 - aspects where uh bringing in such a new
142:22 - technology that's still evolving is
142:23 - really worth the risk in order to solve
142:25 - those needs Tim killing it with
142:27 - questions as always so one of the key
142:30 - advantage of this Prova microad is it
142:32 - can generate more than 1 million nits in
142:35 - brightness so that's about 1,000
142:38 - times LCD on ol I was going to
142:42 - sayal through AR microed is a must have
142:45 - solution to combine with um Essen wave
142:48 - um but for a commercial display 1,000
142:51 - times brightness cost is the very
142:53 - crucial factors um we can actually
142:56 - essentially because it's is much more
142:57 - energy efficient we can reduce his
142:59 - brightness by use much less power so
143:01 - essentially the um at the top
143:04 - manufacturer especially in China uh is
143:06 - working with us in developing the this
143:08 - material technology uh in their
143:10 - commercial display
143:12 - wow I think this guy's a contender here
143:14 - for thank you so much Sky life the
143:18 - because very very good presentation
143:20 - please score their
143:21 - proposal times Light My Town yeah
143:24 - probably you might need like special
143:26 - sunglasses to look at it I think it's
143:27 - just a demonstration of the
143:29 - capability for media choice I think we
143:32 - have two left guys I really liked that
143:35 - one that's one of my favorite ones so
143:36 - far uh that's come up I just thought it
143:37 - was a very clear presentation as well
143:39 - which I can't say for all of them some
143:41 - of them were a little bit all over the
143:42 - place all right coming right up like a
143:44 - Clear Vision too on what they want to do
143:46 - from
143:47 - Estonia Estonia interesting okay any
143:51 - possibility for caption unfortunately
143:52 - guys it can't live caption afterwards
143:55 - YouTube should autoc caption this for
143:57 - you um but I I don't think you can do
143:59 - like live stream captions my name is
144:01 - hanisa and I'm the CEO at Wula so our
144:04 - journey at Wula started in 2020 when I
144:06 - used to have my own online store and
144:09 - that's where I saw the plastic packaging
144:11 - problem so 159 billion Parcels were
144:15 - shipped last year and 40% of them in
144:17 - plastic bubble wrap so after seeing this
144:19 - problem I started looking for new
144:22 - materials myself that could replace
144:24 - plastic bubble wrap cuz at the time I
144:26 - needed them in my own online store and
144:28 - it was a very difficult task there were
144:31 - basically no materials out there that
144:33 - would be sustainable and also look good
144:36 - until we found out about sheep wool so
144:39 - we found out that 200,000 tons of sheep
144:43 - wool goes to waste in Europe every year
144:45 - and this is because the quality of of it
144:47 - is very low so you can't textile
144:50 - production you can't do anything from it
144:52 - so farmers were like literally burning
144:54 - or burying the wool and I thought that
144:57 - that's such a shame cuz it's like a
144:58 - natural Miracle material it's elastic it
145:01 - regulates temperatures and humidity and
145:04 - I mean the sheer amount of it 200,000
145:06 - tons that goes to waste this could
145:09 - actually replace all plastic bubble wrap
145:11 - globally and that's exactly what we
145:13 - started doing at wam so we are replacing
145:16 - plastic bubble wrap with wool packaging
145:19 - and this is the first product that we
145:21 - launched it's the wool envelope so it
145:23 - has a recycled paper layer on the
145:25 - outside for printing the message on it
145:27 - and for attaching a label and then it
145:29 - has a wool layer on the inside so the
145:32 - wool layer uh protects Parcels in
145:35 - Transportation uh and the packaging also
145:37 - stands out so these two things combined
145:40 - really helps to keep plastic out of the
145:42 - picture for
145:43 - good our clients are online stores who
145:47 - are shipping fragile Goods so companies
145:49 - who are making Electronics Beauty and
145:51 - skincare products jewelry Watches luxury
145:55 - products perfume supplements Etc and our
145:58 - main markets right now are France and
146:00 - Scandinavia so here's a quick overview
146:02 - of some of our clients wonder if it's
146:05 - laun um the product into the market in
146:07 - 2020 so the same year that we uh got the
146:09 - idea so we're already quite active in
146:12 - the market um we have early traction so
146:14 - a monthly revenue of 35,000
146:17 - is what we do right now it's not bad
146:20 - considering examples of how2 Millies are
146:23 - currently being used so here's an
146:25 - example of an online store who is uh
146:27 - using vula to ship out their Electronics
146:30 - so phones um headphones watch must like
146:33 - that and here's the newest prototype
146:36 - that we have so this is a watch box we
146:38 - made specifically for Oppo you can also
146:40 - see this in the demo area so oppon
146:42 - needed a um wool component in their
146:45 - watch packaging to protected during
146:47 - Transportation so we made this early
146:49 - prototype this is super soft by the way
146:51 - guys this material feels really cool and
146:53 - uh in terms of the other industry so
146:55 - this is a very cool example of the Dutch
146:58 - perfumery that's called Sal PR who is
147:00 - using Wula to ship um their perfumes and
147:03 - they actually also use it as retail
147:06 - packaging and here's a French company
147:09 - called mmas boo who is shipping
147:11 - cosmetics in woa as a standard packaging
147:13 - see that makes more sense to me elect
147:15 - example from a comp
147:18 - usinga to ship out like supplements and
147:21 - vitamins and we are also working with
147:23 - the luxury sector so we are working with
147:26 - the lbmh group uh that houses Brands
147:28 - like Louis vuon and Dior and many others
147:31 - and we are the winner of The lbmh
147:34 - Innovation award in sustainability which
147:36 - we just got uh this year in
147:38 - June in terms of uh our production so we
147:42 - are based in Estonia and so is our
147:44 - production so we have our own
147:48 - everything we produce is in house and
147:50 - the factory is also based in Estonia and
147:52 - in terms of like uh energy we have our
147:55 - own uh autonomous renewable energy grids
147:58 - that we partially use for powering the
148:00 - factory and in terms of certificates so
148:03 - we are very proud to be a certified BC
148:05 - Corp as of this year and our products
148:07 - are also uh FSC certified and we're in
148:10 - the final stages of getting the TV
148:12 - certification I don't know what a b cor
148:14 - is we are an externally fun company so
148:17 - we are backed by Future Ventures which
148:20 - is a Silicon Valley based VC fund that
148:22 - has invested €3 million EUR in tuula 3
148:25 - million EUR okay very importantly the
148:27 - people behind all of this so our team
148:30 - we're quite a small team of 15 uh people
148:33 - um but we have uh a
148:35 - 50% uh ratio uh of all managerial roles
148:39 - being filled by women at wola and when
148:41 - we were looking for a location for our
148:44 - Factory we chose um a region that is
148:48 - very rural and it has a high rate of
148:50 - chronical chronically underemployed
148:52 - people so 30% of our population comes
148:55 - from that segment and impr all of our
148:58 - employes have stock options at Wula
149:00 - because this is the only way that we
149:02 - think it makes sense to work towards
149:04 - this very big mission I don't know if
149:05 - that's good from an investor perspective
149:07 - the last thing I want to talk about is
149:08 - what to do with Wula packaging after the
149:11 - end user receives it so there's three
149:13 - options uh reuse it return it or compost
149:16 - it and the ReUse part probably needs the
149:18 - most explanation uh and it's also the
149:21 - most fun thing to explain uh in my
149:23 - opinion so these are all ideas what you
149:25 - can do with woa packaging after you
149:27 - receive it C I totally do that actually
149:30 - got most of these ideas from our end
149:32 - users they just started posting about it
149:34 - on social media and tag us this is so
149:36 - for example you can use the wool
149:38 - packaging as a dish mop that you can see
149:40 - in the first photo um for some reason
149:43 - cats and dogs really like sleeping uh on
149:45 - the W parts so people use it as a pet
149:48 - bed you can use it for DIY projects you
149:50 - can um make shoe insoles from it because
149:54 - this is really sick like legitimately
149:56 - reusable humity so for Nordic climates
149:58 - it works very well you can also use it
150:00 - as a plant fertilizer and there are a
150:03 - lot of um opportunities a pencil case
150:05 - that's interesting so I briefly already
150:06 - mentioned the um packaging prototype
150:08 - that we made for Oppo so this was a good
150:11 - test for us to see if we can help opo
150:13 - replace plastic and I think the
150:15 - Prototype showed that we can so we're
150:17 - very excited to see if there are more
150:18 - opportunities for us to work together
150:21 - thank you very much another good
150:23 - presentation clear have 2 minutes and 35
150:25 - seconds for Q&A Judes right on time too
150:28 - wow well
150:33 - done uh I have a question regarding how
150:36 - you plan to uh scale up the business you
150:39 - mentioned
150:42 - there
150:43 - 200,000 uh tons of uh wasted War
150:47 - annually in Europe alone so uh with your
150:50 - factory in Estonia and uh uh what's your
150:54 - plan on utilizing all these ws and uh
150:57 - shipping the uh packaging product to all
151:01 - over the world yeah I feel like is not
151:04 - the best location for that factory has
151:06 - quite a high production capacity we can
151:08 - make up to 800,000 packages a month so
151:12 - in terms of Revenue we're talking about
151:14 - like roughly 400,000 so the production
151:17 - capacity is quite High to you know Serv
151:19 - as a big portion of Europe but we are um
151:22 - very much looking into expanding to Asia
151:25 - as well and if we do that then we are
151:27 - going to um duplicate our production
151:30 - line and the let's say good thing about
151:32 - it is that we are uh let's say a very um
151:36 - like our production technology is very
151:38 - affordable to duplicate and in terms of
151:40 - timeline it can be done within 6 months
151:43 - so that's one of like our core
151:44 - advantages that has basically brought us
151:46 - here well I feel like the scalability is
151:50 - a bit of an issue for me to see here
151:51 - follow up on that question in terms of
151:53 - your wasteful sourcing um are there any
151:55 - concerns about the stability of your
151:57 - sources in terms of competitors uh maybe
151:59 - not even competing in this area but
152:01 - competitors wanting to access that waste
152:03 - wol or any limitations and scaling from
152:06 - the amount of total Global waste wol
152:09 - yeah
152:10 - so the amount of waste wo is so big that
152:13 - it's quite hard to grasp you know what
152:15 - this 200 ,000 tons mean but I mentioned
152:18 - before that our U Max production
152:20 - capacity right now is 800,000 packages
152:23 - and if we were to work at Max Capacity
152:26 - right now the amount of wool that we
152:28 - would need yearly is around 1% of the
152:32 - 200,000 tons so this is how much waste
152:35 - wool there actually is so yeah running
152:38 - out of material basically is not like a
152:40 - risk we we're seeing right
152:43 - now I have I think she's not really
152:45 - thinking of like a huge huge perspective
152:48 - envelope yeah so our replacement product
152:51 - is mainly the plastic bubble wrap
152:53 - envelope because we're focused on like
152:54 - the protective aspect of it and we are
152:57 - more expensive of course but we are
152:59 - quite competitive so we have different
153:01 - sizes and the products product Prices
153:04 - range between 60 cents to1 Euro and we
153:07 - mainly work on quantity so we're focused
153:09 - on you know larger larger deals and we
153:12 - also offer like quantity discounts but
153:14 - those are the retail prices
153:17 - okay thank you so much woa for your
153:19 - wonderful that was a really good
153:20 - presentation as well guys I I fear that
153:22 - she's like thinking on a smaller level
153:24 - cuz I'm hearing numbers like 35k 400k
153:27 - like these kind of guys that are judging
153:28 - here I think have a billion dollar
153:30 - potential right can this company grow to
153:32 - a billion doll company maybe it's cool
153:35 - but out of Estonia probably not right
153:37 - 400k per month Max Revenue out of one
153:39 - facility it sounds like a lot but it's
153:41 - not really that much
153:43 - so that's still it's a good price range
153:45 - but I'm just C curious like can they
153:47 - actually expand and scale to that point
153:50 - last two proposals Unfortunately they
153:52 - cannot join us in person in Singapore
153:55 - but they will join us online let welcome
153:58 - our next team I like from Israel and the
154:01 - proposal 3D interactive
154:05 - platform okay this is the one I mixed up
154:07 - earlier this is going to be on Zoom
154:09 - [Music]
154:12 - guys
154:15 - everyone
154:16 - we are grateful to the organizer for
154:19 - allowing us to participate remotely
154:22 - thank you very much for your
154:24 - understanding and now I will ask you to
154:27 - close your eyes for a few seconds and
154:37 - listen you can open your eyes now if I
154:40 - will ask you what it was all about you
154:43 - would probably tells me that it was
154:46 - taken from a movie scene but guys it's
154:50 - actually 15 seconds that we recorded in
154:53 - a random street in t Aviv can you
154:56 - imagine yourself navigating this
154:58 - situation without see
155:01 - anything we are already in
155:04 - 2023 and the technological advancements
155:07 - are on its way and yet these are the
155:11 - most common solution for partially sided
155:14 - and blind people with today achievements
155:17 - we are able and committed to give them
155:20 - much more based on this fact iight was
155:24 - founded so highlight is developing a
155:27 - smartphone size surface that can model
155:30 - complex object create Real Time 3D maps
155:34 - and even replicate facial features with
155:37 - this tech technology user can actually
155:40 - touch feel and understand their
155:44 - environment everywhere they are
155:47 - in the initial phase the surface
155:49 - interface with smartphone s case on its
155:52 - back but in the future it will be
155:54 - embedded inside the motivation behind
155:57 - the product is the familiar Gadget the
155:59 - pinard surface highlight has invented a
156:02 - novel moded for metrix control of high
156:04 - resolution surface we know how to
156:06 - simultaneously operate thousands of
156:08 - linear pixels using only one engine in
156:11 - real time and with minimal power
156:14 - consumption
156:16 - whoa okay here you can see our demo
156:19 - using computer vision and AI algorithms
156:21 - we have six steps of analyzing we
156:23 - started with real time streaming that is
156:26 - captured by a stereo camera after that
156:29 - we convert the input to a depth map then
156:31 - to point Cloud rotating the point of
156:34 - view to top view and eventually
156:36 - demonstrated the whole of this process
156:38 - into a live pin art simulator this
156:40 - simulator represent the topographic map
156:43 - of the room and the person that
156:45 - navigates inside
156:46 - so they can feel on their hands of 16
156:49 - pixel just to prove our concept and
156:51 - technology in the video on the left the
156:53 - physical Matrix gets the input using a
156:55 - 3D camera that identifies the location
156:58 - of the cube and demonstrates it's on the
157:00 - smart surface in the video in the middle
157:04 - the physical metrix get wireless input
157:06 - from a remote application the user
157:08 - changes the location and the height of
157:10 - the green Cube and as you can see the SM
157:13 - the SM surface changes accordingly
157:17 - in the video on the right we have
157:18 - connected the previous live streaming
157:20 - from the room but this time to a real
157:23 - hour surface it illustrates the great
157:25 - refresh rate that can be reached using
157:27 - our technology and the potential of our
157:30 - backr product today we are in the
157:32 - initial production phase of the first
157:35 - product that already contains thousands
157:37 - of pixels mean she is one of the
157:41 - participants in our experiments that
157:43 - highlight conducts periodically with
157:45 - potential end users she's totally blind
157:48 - from birth here she's navate using our
157:51 - product so she's holding a pin map room
157:54 - to reach the white chair located on the
157:56 - right side of the room this room she has
157:58 - never navigated before as you can see
158:01 - the amazing results even surprised
158:07 - us so guys she's holding essentially 3D
158:10 - mapping of the room that's using a pin
158:12 - out map million people are estimated to
158:14 - be partially on blinds and this number
158:17 - is growing
158:19 - exponentially every 5 Seconds someone in
158:22 - the words goes blind our business model
158:26 - is based on product sale alongside a
158:28 - Subs model premium services and special
158:32 - features in a highly competitive market
158:36 - highlight stands out with very clear
158:39 - advantages including a user user
158:42 - friendly interface the ability to
158:44 - operate at any moment moment and
158:46 - environment and of course personal
158:50 - customization so we started our journey
158:53 - about three years ago received a
158:55 - non-dilutive governmental Grant secured
158:59 - preed by Israel Innovation Authority and
159:01 - incubate Ventures now we are
159:04 - transitioning from development to
159:06 - production and one year from now we aim
159:09 - to launch our first product in the
159:12 - market as an ambitious team which has
159:15 - reached technological skills and of
159:18 - course clear message we want to good
159:21 - question the chat guys see if they ask
159:23 - that or not Imp in the world our
159:25 - technology has long-term potential in
159:27 - various aspects just think how much the
159:29 - digital world today lacks the sense of
159:32 - touch the experience doesn't feel
159:34 - authentic and the existing human machine
159:36 - interfaces lack sensibilities just to
159:39 - give you a teaser imagine our product
159:41 - assisting to a doctor or surgeon in real
159:43 - time to obtain tangible information that
159:46 - aids in their decision Mak process the
159:50 - wild can help as a remote control and
159:52 - remote steering platform our system will
159:55 - be able to both model in 3D and identify
159:59 - user input in real time and how the
160:01 - gaming experience looks when the user
160:03 - can feel what they see totally
160:05 - mind-blowing currently we are in the
160:07 - seed funding ground and we are welcome
160:09 - any connection to VCS and private
160:11 - investors additionally we are seeking
160:13 - for Business Partnership and Joint PC's
160:16 - thank you very much thank you you now
160:19 - have two minutes and 52 seconds for Q&A
160:22 - I wonder if they're live on Zoom resp
160:24 - good question though I don't know how
160:25 - detailed this is and if they can do
160:27 - small objects and moving objects seems
160:29 - like it's designed for stationary
160:31 - terrain if you test it your product in
160:33 - an outdoor evolving environment yeah
160:36 - there you
160:38 - go hi everyone and fortunately we cannot
160:41 - be in in person in Singapore but this is
160:45 - a good good question currently all the
160:47 - testing were in indoor environment
160:50 - because of the transformation but
160:53 - accordingly to the R&D plan we are talk
160:55 - talking about doing the outdoor testing
160:59 - in the near
161:00 - future okay that would have been I wish
161:03 - they had done that CU I would have said
161:04 - a lot probably about the
161:07 - product good questions in the chat you
161:10 - um that you were using a cane and the
161:13 - device at the same time so the idea of
161:15 - the device is not to replace a cane for
161:17 - the smaller motor functions to prevent
161:19 - tripping but rather to provide kind of a
161:22 - larger infrastructure for
161:24 - navigation exactly this is what
161:27 - highlights does honestly we are a
161:29 - compliment complimentary product the the
161:33 - aim is not to replace an assist another
161:36 - assistive guide but also to give another
161:39 - demonstration of the environment in
161:41 - order them more a 3D map you can tou um
161:46 - ability to understand what is going on
161:48 - in the surrounding in the first phase we
161:51 - are aimed to to be as a complimentary
161:53 - product but in the long run it's
161:56 - supposed to
161:57 - cover the the
162:00 - dog and the dog training or the
162:04 - assistive a I'm not really sure what she
162:06 - just said
162:07 - there so a person with uh blind
162:12 - disability does he or she uh require
162:16 - special training in order to understand
162:19 - what the device is uh sending out as uh
162:23 - information uh as a follow-up question
162:26 - uh so with this uh how do you compare it
162:29 - uh with uh for example audio edit uh
162:35 - navigation so this question at the first
162:39 - point um iight is looking um not only to
162:44 - to be separated product but also to be
162:47 - as a platform that the camera as you can
162:50 - see in this in the video and a
162:53 - complimentary um audio feedback about
162:56 - what is going on the surrounding and the
162:58 - collaboration between the S the sound
163:00 - and the S the touch supposed to cover
163:03 - the visual
163:04 - Gap um so this is our how the platform
163:09 - does and about your um second thought
163:13 - the second uh question about competitors
163:16 - what is the added value of highight is
163:18 - the the volume if we are looking the
163:22 - competitors most of them are doing
163:25 - manipul manipulation in order to um
163:28 - stimulate and gesture but the learning
163:31 - process of highlight is very very simple
163:34 - and clear just imagine that as cided
163:38 - person unid P blind needs to touch thing
163:42 - in in the physical places in order to
163:45 - you identify what the objects are it's
163:48 - the same but in a small size so the the
163:52 - learning process as we did in the
163:54 - PC um experience just clear the
164:00 - the the message that the product is very
164:03 - intuitive for the user and also um very
164:07 - short learned H learning process thank
164:11 - you so much are pretty early to be
164:14 - honest with you
164:17 - 3D interactive platform Med friends
164:20 - please vote VI media Choice link thank
164:22 - we have one more I think we have one
164:24 - more I'm not sure that was I think they
164:26 - said that was the second last one I
164:27 - think there's one more take a moment to
164:29 - consolidate the current scores before
164:31 - the final team takes the
164:33 - stage I wonder who do you guys think is
164:35 - going to win at this point this
164:37 - is yeah this is interesting I really
164:39 - don't know there's so many present
164:41 - they're so different ladies and
164:42 - gentlemen welcome our final LED guy
164:46 - smart res from is and their proposal
164:49 - biased solution for flexible Electronics
164:52 - oh I messed that up there was I don't
164:54 - know what the other one was that was
164:55 - like that really cool like orb thing
165:00 - that was uh the reusable materials well
165:02 - they have a lot of reusable ones I don't
165:04 - know let's
165:05 - see smart resin okay my name is Leon and
165:08 - I'm the CEO of smart
165:10 - residing I would like to thank you for
165:12 - the opportunity to present smart
165:13 - resident raliz solution for flexible
165:16 - Electronics flexible display are the
165:18 - future of technology and it's going to
165:20 - change the entire way we use our devices
165:23 - and the entire user
165:25 - experience the most common material in
165:27 - news today is poly meat there are other
165:30 - polymers mostly fossil derived that
165:32 - continue to contribute to the growth in
165:35 - e-w they are also lack of performance
165:37 - and expensive to produce therefore we
165:40 - must find a biobased solution cellulose
165:43 - is a great fit due to to its chemical
165:46 - structure is of handling and
165:48 - biodegradability cellulose is the most
165:50 - abandoned biopolymer on Earth it's
165:53 - basically a sugar that can generate
165:55 - transparent film as you can see on the
165:56 - upper side of the slide however the
165:59 - resulted film is brittle smart resident
166:02 - combines the most elastic material in
166:04 - nature resident protein with cellulose
166:07 - to give flexible yet strong film as you
166:10 - can see on the down side of the
166:12 - slide so what is resing
166:15 - imagine you could jump to the top of
166:17 - Statue of Liberty in a single jump it
166:20 - turns out that fleas has the equivalent
166:22 - ability they can jump about 100 times
166:24 - their height in order to get to the top
166:26 - of a dog or a cat and they can do it due
166:29 - to this amazing protein named
166:32 - residing so we decided to bring residing
166:35 - as a biobased natural solution to
166:37 - pollutant and harmful materials we can
166:40 - then provide alternative super
166:41 - performing materials for sustainable
166:43 - application oh how do we do it we don't
166:46 - kill insect to take out residing rather
166:48 - we use genetic engineering technique to
166:50 - take the DNA that code for residing we
166:52 - can tailor fitted to bind to cellulose
166:54 - or any other biopolymer in the future we
166:57 - then introduce it into bacterial cells
166:59 - that can produce a lot of this protein
167:01 - in a fermentation process we are a
167:04 - spin-off of the Hebrew University and
167:05 - have an exclusive licensing agreement
167:07 - with
167:08 - them in order to bring residing as an
167:10 - available solution to the industry we
167:12 - have established a joint venture with a
167:15 - 17 years of experience biotechnological
167:17 - company asss bio we already established
167:20 - the first Milestone the fermentation
167:23 - yield and are now working on the second
167:24 - target which is the production cost in
167:27 - order to achieve that we have set up a
167:29 - few Milestones by
167:30 - 2024 the first one was already
167:33 - established the optimal media which is
167:35 - basically the food that we give to the
167:37 - bacteria in order for them to grow we
167:39 - need to scale up from a few hundred
167:41 - liters to 10,000 liter inhouse and
167:45 - hundred of thousands in the future we
167:47 - continue to develop analytical and
167:50 - downstream processing we put emphasis on
167:52 - eoe efficiency and optimal use of
167:55 - resources that will eventually enable us
167:58 - to optimize for large scale production
168:01 - this is actually the 10,000 lit tank
168:03 - fermentation that is in use in asss
168:06 - facilities today resident can then be
168:08 - mixed with nanocellular to generate a
168:10 - film that is flexible transparent and
168:14 - strong we can control the thickness the
168:17 - there are Green Solution using
168:18 - biodegradable materials they are
168:19 - lightweighted scratch resistant have
168:22 - good performance in blocking UV and they
168:24 - expected to be lower at cost in
168:26 - comparison to poly in large scale so
168:28 - there you go guys this is what is
168:29 - replacing qualities mechanical Optical
168:32 - thermal and electrical are a great Feit
168:34 - for this industry just imagine a dragon
168:37 - fly that fla the wing millions of times
168:40 - with no fatigue due to the resling it
168:43 - integrated into your smartphone that you
168:45 - can fold again and again oh H we
168:49 - currently produce our film in lab scale
168:51 - using a roller coaster a roller coaster
168:53 - as you can see in this video and then
168:55 - let it dry but in large scale we have
168:58 - available roll to- roll facilities that
169:00 - is a well-known continuous fabrication
169:02 - process for flexible substrate for
169:05 - example Cod of film is produced just
169:08 - like that residing has other use cases
169:11 - that for example residing film that is
169:14 - just residing they are very elastic
169:17 - films and can be used for example for
169:19 - cosmetic Solutions another example is
169:22 - resing hydrogel that are cross-link
169:25 - resling that can be integrated into
169:27 - sports goods we can use it as a 3D ink
169:30 - since resing is a photopolymerized
169:32 - biopolymer and as a composite with
169:34 - nanocellulose as a first solution for
169:37 - flexible
169:40 - electron they want flexible electronics
169:42 - that makes biology and material science
169:45 - my background is biotechnology I did my
169:48 - PhD at Professor o lab who is by himself
169:51 - an entrepreneur who started more than
169:54 - this a bit complicated to follow but I
169:55 - think I'm kind of getting and Daniel
169:57 - brings best expertise in Material
169:59 - Science biotechnology and Business
170:01 - Development our board of directors bring
170:04 - vast expertise
170:06 - in financials and Business Development
170:09 - Al together we bring this to life yeah
170:12 - that makes more sense impact we are
170:14 - looking to reduce the use of toxic
170:15 - chemicals save energy in the production
170:18 - process replace synthetic
170:19 - non-biodegradable materials and lower
170:21 - the overall CO2 emission to summarize we
170:25 - expect high sell potential within two
170:26 - years companies in the biofabrication
170:29 - field are already evaluated as unicorns
170:32 - we could just be the next one it's a
170:34 - rapidly growing field we established a
170:36 - joint venture to be the first to
170:38 - commercialize rling we collaborate with
170:40 - leading Global Brands and already
170:42 - generated over half a million in incomes
170:45 - we enter the ESG impact with our
170:47 - ecological process and products we have
170:49 - a solid technology and a strong team to
170:51 - do all of that I would like to thank you
170:54 - and call you to join us in bringing
170:55 - residing to the mass market so guys this
170:57 - is the last presentation sorry to speak
171:00 - overas material we're going to do the
171:02 - Q&A and then unfortunately I'm not
171:04 - actually allowed to Le to you who win
171:05 - this you have to go to check QA Jud
171:09 - gonna do a Q&A here let me know in the
171:10 - chat right now who you guys think is
171:11 - going to win I think LED the LED
171:15 - presentation is is one of the top ones
171:16 - for sure I think the big 300 million us
171:19 - one has potential as well even though
171:20 - they don't really need like the exposure
171:22 - that they have here I really like the
171:24 - haptic one I don't think that's going to
171:25 - win though the 3D modeling one looks
171:27 - good if we look at something like P it's
171:30 - primarily for the price manufacturing
171:33 - but when we look at something like
171:34 - polyamid uh it's not so much about the
171:36 - price but the durability and harsh
171:38 - environments including space um so I
171:41 - guess uh to start with you're really
171:43 - targeting the flexible Electronics
171:45 - specifically um could you mention maybe
171:49 - what specific uh advantages you have
171:52 - besides the source of the material in
171:54 - that
171:56 - space Also performance wise uh I mean
171:59 - for example polyamid is very easily
172:01 - creased whereas our solution is not that
172:04 - easily creased we have better results
172:06 - for example using um a pensile test so
172:10 - to see how it g uh it's it's stronger
172:14 - when we tested T side stress guys let me
172:17 - know who you think wise we are better uh
172:20 - however we do have disadvantage in terms
172:22 - of stability for temperature but still
172:26 - uh our qualities are good for this
172:28 - Market we are stable up to 280 degrees
172:31 - which is very good for uh you know for
172:33 - biobased materials and it's good enough
172:36 - for this market so even though poly is
172:38 - stable up to 300 and more we are still
172:41 - good for this
172:43 - application
172:50 - guys again we're going to end right
172:51 - after this Q&A so if it's abrupt I
172:53 - apologize about that uh sorry I'll jump
172:56 - in again yeah in terms of the total
172:58 - available U fermentation facilities
173:01 - globally um do you think that you can
173:03 - meet the scaling that would be needed to
173:05 - really jump into a consumer device
173:08 - product definitely ACS bio already have
173:12 - a partner in in China that have the
173:15 - capacity of 250,000 liters and there are
173:18 - available up to half a million in Europe
173:21 - in the US so and and they're just
173:23 - standing available for any manufacturing
173:25 - that wants to come so once we establish
173:27 - a large scale fermentation process that
173:30 - is durable we can do it anywhere in the
173:32 - world which is also uh contribute to the
173:35 - you know to the sustainability because
173:37 - we can produce anywhere uh lowering the
173:39 - transportation
173:41 - issues thank you nice all right guys
173:44 - that was was the last presentation LED
173:46 - guy 3D tracking personally I like the
173:47 - haptic one but it's not going to win I
173:49 - don't think um Wula was pretty good but
173:52 - I don't think they really have that
173:53 - longm wrest for your wonderful
173:56 - proposal and judges please score our
173:59 - final proposal biobased solution for
174:01 - flexible Electronics Med a friends
174:04 - please also vote via the media Choice

175:53 - event like this but uh just in terms of
175:55 - Q&A talking seeing some cool stuff if
175:57 - anything this definitely inspired me it
175:59 - gave me really some cool ideas for like
176:02 - what you could do with tech and these
176:03 - startups these startups have like 50k in
176:05 - funding and look what they're able to do
176:07 - really really impressive and like all of
176:10 - these are practically brand new one of
176:12 - them was 2016 but most of them are like
176:13 - 2020 2021
176:16 - 2023 really really cool all right guys
176:18 - going to hop off the stream here thank
176:20 - you guys so much I will see you in some
176:22 - more YouTube videos comments Etc make
176:24 - sure you like the stream share it it
176:26 - will be available shortly after this in
176:28 - DVR on the Channel with that said take
176:31 - it easy guys

Cleaned transcript:

okay guys let me know okay I think we are live here guys I'm not sure yet if you can see me let me know in the chat I'm just going to let a few people file in here and then we're going to start kind of going through a quick intro but I think we're good I think we are live please let me know if you can see me in the chat that' be very helpful and I'm going to explain what we're doing here today looks like we are good I see the stream live it is going okay hi welcome everybody let me tell you what we're doing today we are in Singapore very far away from Canada took me about 30 hours to arrive here and I'm going to be streaming the Oppo inspiration challenge what you're about to see here are 15 very interesting and very Hightech projects that are pretty Innovative now Oppo I've got some notes here to read here uh has a mission technology for mankind kindness for the world inspiration ahe all these projects you're about to see here were submitted in kind of like a a previous competition or like a previous round there was almost 700 proposals and these are the top five projects from the following three regions we have Boston in the USA we have shenzen China we have Bangkok Thailand these are the best projects the top five from each so we have 15 in total and they're competing here today to win up to $50,000 in Grants the opportunity to network connect with some top Oppo professionals um people to raise investment Etc I'm going to be kind of ranking these projects so I'm going to be giving my personal opinion on them impact presentation how good they are Etc going to be a really interesting stream I'm going to sit back for most of it we're just going to watch again I'm live in Singapore there's a huge Stadium over there where they're kind of doing all the presentation and I'm sat in this back little room uh and I'm going to be kind of commentating it pretty interesting opportunity I'm just going to take a second here to read the chat this obviously will be DVR you guys be able to watch it after and I want to hear your feedback through the whole thing okay let me know how the audio levels are let me know what you guys think about the presentations that's the whole point of this stream I think we're good we got 97 people in here right now um yeah so what do you guys think so far let me know in the live chat I'm going to be kind of updating this or reading it as we go through we're going to be starting in 1 minute okay so once that starts I'm going to be quiet we're going to listen to the presentation there's going to be 15 of them there's going to be some break we're going to be on for about 3 4 hours probably and yeah um I guess some more stuff to share with you guys here these teams will have the opportunity to go through an acceleration Camp so kind of like a startup incubator that's provided by the Oppo Research Institute they're going to be able to win 50k in Grants and up to 190k in startup funding from this accelerator with some strategic Partnerships Etc looks like we're about 30 seconds away from start and thank you yeah welcome to Singapore absolutely beautiful country um long flight but definitely worth it when we sit in here other than all the humidity and stuff looks like we are about to starts the final demo event of opo research institute Innovation accelerator will start in one minute please be seated and put your mobile devices on silent mode thank you for your cooperation we do have simultaneous interpretation headphones available please turn to channel 1 for Chinese language thank you so what you guys are seeing right now is exactly where I am there's a huge like Convention Center all these people are like I don't know 200 300 met away from me and I'm in this back room kind of streaming the whole feed which is a bit hilarious they kicked everyone out I've got guards at the door this is awesome I'm looking forward to this presentation we're starting in 1 minute guys let me know what you think in the chat and yeah we're ready to get get started here you guys see me do I look good how's the camera how's my face also guys let me know how the music is and the audio levels everything's too quiet too loud tell me you guys know I'm not a pro streamer but I've done it enough times and like I said as we go through the presentations here I'm going to kind of rank them I've got some notes down here and I'm going to say you know kind of my personal opinion and I want to hear what you guys think too if you like them if you don't like them everything is perfect thank you guys very much appreciate you we're going to be going for a long time here guys I'm going to need you in the chat here to uh to keep me company hi blind gamer how you doing got a little scen good afternoon to all our distinguished guests proposal teams medor friends and online audiences welcome to the final demo event of the 2023 opal inspiration challenge my name is Shannon and I'm really privileged to be right here to be your host for today based on oppo's brand proposition of inspiration ahead the inspiration challenge is initiated by opo Research Institute and is established to empower technology professionals and entrepreneurs to bring innovative solutions to life for a better future together the theme of this challenge is virtual Innovation with two categories inspiration for people and inspiration for the planet today we have 15 startups and their incredible get my room in they running to be in the global top five of the 2023 opal inspiration challenge you may view the startup brochure for the full agenda and an introduction for each of the startup teams we are very honored to invite our partners as judges for today's Final challenge please allow me to introduce director of Industry Innovation at gsma fisel Zia to those of you guys in the live chat I'll talk more about this let's listen to the Asia investment at tamask International Cassie woo General partner at eight roads of Del International Shan Shan director of xote Freda Jung next we have our expert judges from opo head of opo research institute Jason Leo vice president head of finance and investment at opo Vivan Chu technical director at opal Health lab Timothy Wht looks like a good guy his name is last but not least we have head of investment department at opal Sophia Chow let's give a big round of applause for all our wonderful judges again they do have a hard time today I'm going to be PR to be joined by our media friends who will vote for today's media Choice Awards from all our 15 proposals so now ladies and gentlemen I would like to invite head of Oppo Research Institute Mr Jason Leo on stage for his opening remarks and to kick off our final challenge Mr Le please for any of you guys just joining there's going to be a bunch of tech projects that they're going to go through here okay going to be 15 proposals it's going to be about 10 minutes each it's you know professional presentation and they're going to talk to you about a ton of really Innovative Tech projects that they are proposing to essentially like change the world change the planet Etc we'll let this guy talk and tell you about it ladies and gentlemen good afternoon I'm Jason from Oppo it is my great pleasure to be here with you today welcome to the global final demo event of 2023 Oppo inspiration challenge we launched the first opo inspiration challenge in 2022 with the idea of virtuous Innovation and I would like to share the story of one winning proposal from last year's inspiration challenge Tangen diabetics digital solution this is the second year by the way after the competition our wearable devices team organized a work group to assist tanen in integrating their blood glucose monitoring app into op Watch series following the collaboration the app can now be used in the opo watch in the latest opal watch 4 Pro which I'm wearing today there is a customized widget that enables diabetic patients to monitor their blood glucose level level in real time it is also displayed in our demo area so feel free that earlier it's pretty cool during the break in 2023 we continue our journey on empowering Tech professionals and innovators worldwide we believe that we can innovate and bring value to the world together with innovators like you improving

be in line minutes let's give the stage to our final competing teams best of luck to all of you thank you so much Jason going be 15 presentations here okay there only be like 10 minutes those will be the more exciting ones just got to get through all the information so you guys know what the heck you're actually watching here yes and I do believe The Virtuous Innovation and technology is the bright future that all of us are looking forward to so ladies and gentlemen today's Final challenge will offici ially begin as mentioned we have 15 proposals today each pitch will last for 9 minutes with 6 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&A so teams please do manage your time wisely and accordingly the jury will score based on the following four criteria feasibility Innovation and originality longterm potential and social value so let's welcome our first team today hey anap intelligent technology Cod limited from China and their proposal anap haptic solution okay guys I actually messed with this one earlier this is really cool they're going to show you in the presentation but essentially it allows you to feel like all the audio so people that have like visual impairment can actually experience like games this is Jamie I'm the cofounder and CEO from anap and we are a small but cool company focusing on the heptic technology so today I will make a brief introduction of ourself anap was established in 2021 by three heptic experts and me our professors comes from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and bang University we have received the seed run investment from miracle and an angel run investment from seoa capital and City University of Hong Kong 2. million set of products actually we have a very complete ability of products of hatic capabilities which actually contains our hardware and software Solutions our Hardware products are the L Motors and haptic chipset so we can we have the fastest motor development R&D Technologies and for the software ourself developed uh developed heptic algorithm andin AI can generate heptic effects on smartphone controllers and every smart surfaces we use in daily life and we also have reduced the delay time into within uh less than 1 millisecond and which is a world living level so how can our products be integrated with the user experience so uh on the smart devices we can provide this kind of using on every smart devices surface we can provide a layer system heptic SDK which can gener generate all the haptic effects simultaneously and as all the As for the entertainment activities on phones we can perform the corresponding environmental materials for the users and th they we think the thing is much authentic show you some cases we have cooperated with some of our customers for this brand this is ail it is a word famous Windows game conso on each i product we provide the htic chipsets for their products so hundreds of games on I news product will have the heptic effect real timely without any human customized work and in every uh generation of products I has released this function has been the most popular feature and the game players call it the magic haptic I can agree I use this it's so cool you can't really see it from the presentation the top one VR brand in Chinese market so the haptic effects will performed on the two controllers so that the users can control it much more accurately and it can also improve the user experience and the next two scenarios are man focused on fun use so as I mentioned before we have a complete capability of hetic Designing and the product abilities so we have been the main and only product vendor for the world's largest two luxury groups they are every image and the current group we provide the effect for their branding advertisement videos and also we Pro provide some solutions from the marketing and htic interactive point of view such as um for example we have detected a solution named the hotbeat so we can let users to detect their hotbeat on their phone and our AI will transfer the data into a real touch in less than 1 millisecond so in addition to a necklace or a back you can also send your your heart your real heart to the person who you love and uh gu has released this solution in this year's Valentine's Day and FY we will do it in the coming Christmas D so for the gaming use on mobile uh this is a very famous IP in China named the D BG this is a aigc game with uh launched with much attention from The Game Plan players and we provide some tools haptic effect for its uh gaming and the users can play it on their phone a haptic feature has helped these game to increase their da by more than 30% daily active users so it's a very surprised data so um as we have found when we adapted haptic with the content user experience are highly improved so in addition I can agree I was using it it's honestly unbelievable experience as we know haptic is a sensory it's a sensory interactive channels so we can also help our customers to make connection with their end users more accurately and more quickly so finally it will contribute to sales growth and for opo we have special cooperation proposals since opo has a very strong and Complete product ecology so we are developing the haptic SDK with structure of the system for Apple phones and the smart pencils and also wearable scenarios and looking we also working with elos health lab to find the research of the linkage between the heptic and mental health so we all want to create a more comfortable peaceful and safely Digital Life for all op users and in the past year we have quickly acquired many high high quality customers uh the logos here are some of our customers who have really signed the contract with us so uh it's fun as you can see there you guys start in 2020 by the way pretty impressive they have these already so uh this is some my uh contact information please feel free to contact us and also today we bring some uh products and demos here so you can have a try and welcome to our exhibition corner and communicate later thank you very much thank you an intelligent technology Wonder use it was doing with the v head minutes 41 seconds it's it's crazy like you can feel everything that's happening even when they play uh like on your phone with no additional sensors or anything it's just like a way better haptic than what you normally have so they were showing me like a video on the phone of an R8 and it was it felt like it was in the car quick question on social values ESG ele I just wanted to kind of quiet turn B more to that uh yeah that actually it's a very good question and that's what the work we are doing trying to doing now uh as we know some disabled uh people do not have the hearing ability or they can they couldn't see the scenes very clearly so talking kind of users haptic will be a very sens uh very uh very unique channel for them to know what the environment they are in and what uh some what's the things they are touching with so we can provide the environmental materials such as uh what is a metal what is a plastic and so on to uh let this kind of users to know uh whether they are safely or not so that's a a kind of use and we are doing this kind of products I don't know how they do that with the AI guys but it literally like I did the VR headset the controller the phone it to drive the haptics you have the chipset and you also have the AI to automate the various types of hatic interactions um of those what is your strategic advantage and this which of those Technologies are these companies most interested yeah that's really good question as we know uh the motor is a metal metal thing and the uh heptic is a sensory of about human self so what's the linkage between these two things that's a very good question and before that nobody knows the secret of them and we have uh my team has more than 20 years of haptic research so we totally know the receptors along uh beneath our skin and we also know the linkage between the motor and our haptic so uh uh just to answer your question that we know the secret of haptic itself thank you these guys are they already raised this series a by the way atic or data mode around the business yeah uh actually we just launched our SDK product in last year so as you can see we customers last year from the luxury regions and also we are trying to expand this kind of ability to the smart devices and other scenarios uh contains with the electricity vehicles thank you so much team for your fantastic presentation judges please score our first proposal and that haptic solution meet your friends in our audience you can also vote via the link we shared with you earlier on for media choice award thank you I think I muted the stream audio accidentally guys next up please welcome our second team Hawaii medical Technologies cor Limited from China and their proposal contactless Health monitoring technology so guys once we get a break I'll kind of tell you my rankings for these teams this one I'm a little biased cuz I actually used their demo and it was really really cool this one I don't know as much about I'm going to flip to my notes here let's see what we can find on contact here everyone is my great pleasure to be here to share some of our wonderful Technologies today and I'm from shinen Hawaii Medical techn and we F on the next generation of Health sensoring technology here we use the word sensoring because we develop the hardware of sensor as well as the software and algorithm of sensing technology and here we are new startup for about only two years and we did three things in these two years first we established a co team from different background from financing to research engineering and operation and second we have finished our first generation technology and product development and applied several P patent and third we have cooperated with a lot of leading comp leading companies and Research Institute and University and Hospital in China and as we know there's a lot of people we should take care of every day for example the elderly people as we know uh it's about one3 of the ELD people have at least once for at home for at home yeah that's a big problem nobody knows and secondly is uh child we should take care of the child because as we know there are about more than .1% uh infant suffering from the suddenly death in North America and oh wow I know that fact there are some parameters such as the bra stre the C cardiac parameters and maybe the movement can show the abnormity in advance IND there no way to detect that and for another example the clinical clinical and postclinical patients they should monitor their health condition day by day time by time but so far there is no suitable method for example the medical devices too complex and the variable is not comfort and the compliance you're not going to get have variable there and we have provided a solution for the problem we use the millimeter wave R to detect the posture the position the movement and even very tetiny signal from the user the hot beat the Brae and maybe other signal in SLE qualtity and with as we know the mm wave read originally used by the military and recently used by the auto automobile industry and it's a big problem to use this technology to the home home scenarios because this compan raised 100 million object and with a huge movement so we proposed Technology Series we caed one track to solve the problem uh we developed the technology from the front and front end such as antenna design and to the detto pro detto signal processing and to the AI modeling and for example the antenna design technology of our company is totally different from the current commercialized method and therefore we can lower the cost and increase the performance and currently we have do a lot of clinical trials and our result uh our product result is as well as even better than the health watch and that's why there is so much money clinicaly is the first one in the world have proved the possibility to use the radar to detect the uh the cardiac AR Aria wow the the the the the parameters and we have learned our first generation product together with the least company in China ha and we are Co branding and this product is really uh user friendly and we have a lot of Clinic trial and to Pro uh to to uh make sure the Precision is very high compared with the clinical devices and you can see this our product very small and pretty and you can just put it on the wall and go to sleep it's untouched and can detect a lot of parameters your your life and as well as as well we want to we have to make sure it's hes and we have to make sure it privacy data security so we have get a certification of the fccc and our company have passed the uh Glo the international uh quality control system ISO several ISO system for the medical devices research and sale and some ISO standard for the data privacy and this is our partner on the for the business and research for example the the the Kon in we have launched the cobranding product and we now together with opo to do the clinical trials in uh sever disease and of course there are s some other partners and here is our co co team members and you can see is from the top the leading universities in China and from different background uh from the bank of the communication Shanghai Bank of communication for the financing and myself is a professor originally in chinai University and major on biomedical engineering and we these guys have FCC approval guys not FDA what it said you know is a expert in the AI field and here is our plan for our products currently we have uh launched the first two and next year we will launch our R together with the camera to monitor the infant the baby and then we will launch another one to monitor more than one person uh simultaneously and current we uh put our Rita and the watch and MOB phone of opo together to the hospital we have get about more than uh really 1,000 dat set and and we know the trend the the technology Trend the 6G and short dist distance uh date communication is the train for future and the minim wave is very similar to the the the the technology above so we want to integrate our intellect perception method together with that technology and maybe more options with opo so uh we have closed two round of our uh financing and about $4 million and with evaluation about $2 million what okay that's not what it says in my notes guys all right I guess that was incorrect team now you have one a lot of money to raise seconds for Q and A what what does that say that here total value of previous funding okay maybe that was meant to be 1.5 million I don't know what it's I have to install um the Hardware in every room or I only need to install one Hardware in one home so that I can monitor all the people family uh in fact since uh the Privacy reason and other technology reasons the mm wave we cannot allow it through the wall because you may monitor your neighbors problem so currently we use we use our device to in one room one device okay and my second question is um uh would that be okay that the data or the warning would be um installed in our phone so that I can know my family's situation yeah if your family is uh sharing her uh his or her data to you because uh the the data Pro privacy issue um if he allowed you can see her data or she data that means I still have to have set app yeah yeah yeah app or in China we have the we chat function okay yeah interesting so what they're saying guys this is device that you just put in the room you don't need to weable or anything your techical barrier your algorithm or your uh the chip uh in fact except the chip we designed the antenna and algorithm and AI model except the cheap uh how about compared with the competitors the cost and the accurancy of your uh solution I think uh currently as I just mentioned we are the only one company can detect the very tetiny signal from the maybe the the cardiac signal we are the that's insane that they can do that this kind of you're not wearing anything you can detect the signal when you're in the room of this thank you to Hawai medical technologist for your fantastic proposal judges please score this proposal contact L Health monitoring technology media friends please reminded to vote via the link we shared with you earlier on from media Choice also thank you yeah someone's saying it could be like a security device and you monitor like babies and stuff yeah this really I want to learn more about that 6 minutes is not enough to explain like how these things actually work right but I mean that that is what it is guys really that one is so I like the haptic one cuz I actually used that that's really cool but I could totally see like how much better would that be to just have that in the room you don't have to wear like a watch or aand you don't even worry just there you don't even know it's there solution for smarton okay let's see this is a bit of a different type here not as Hightech more sustainability Focus let me see F these guys sythetic biology Company from China uh it's my great owner to participate in this great event and I would like like s OPP to provide this opportunity that all these great ideas could be demonstrated here to realizing the innovate for better work today the topic will proposed is an Innovative ecofriendly packaging solution for opo smartphone today our world is choking on plastic year huge amount of the plastic waste leaked into the environment especially to the ocean this is a big threat to the marine animals and uh actually it will take hundreds of years for it degradable and uh this will create the microplastics to it safety to the safety threat to the human race ourselves you can see this photo that when people found this sea turtle there's a plastic in it nose so this is all because of the conventional manufacturer is based on the petrol oil it cannot change the situation fundamentally since the plastic created there's already 9 billion tons of plastic uh created according to the oecd data there's only less than 10% recycled and uh there's reports indicate that the synthetic biology can provide a new path to the global carbon neutral and bluea is a company based on the synthetic biology which is probably the one of the hottest track in the past decade and the most attractive thing is that it can produce almost everything without p 300 million materal and molecular Innovation and we build our Advanced R platform owering product development today the our first pipeline product is bluea PHA it's a natural material it is based on biomass f stock and it has excellent biodegradability and the most amazing thing is that it has v variety properties similar as the plastic just as other uh natural materials from plant or from animal our pH product is from another natural creatures is from the microorganism it's just like the fat in the human body microbial created inside the cell this is a t uh T TM photos we took from the fermentation process you can see the pH grow from the cell in the beginning and full of the cell at the end and from the biobased dimension and biodegrad uh biodegradable Dimension pH is regarded as the most uh most biodegradable material to replace the conventional plastic and it also has some very good properties Like Oxygen humidity barrier and it also has the hydroxy stability and we can use this properties to create all kinds of the applications currently blue P has already achieved the international sta certificates on the ecofriendly and sa that's a pretty big deal for fing this experiment we took that used the sea water from shenen you can see the straws that we based on the BHA uh pH that it will degradate very quickly and also we have the very good shelf life look at the difference there guys on the right side that's there on the left side we attended the uh China Road Show inspiration challenge we proposed this idea to opal that uh we can provide a ecofriendly package but at that time we don't have the prop prototype the idea needs to turn ground so the opal ID team industry design team quickly get into touch with us and they provide their design they help us to design the package and we quickly made out this demo product and I I saw this in the demo area f it because we don't want to just provide a product we want to Pro provide a consumer good experience so actually feels really cool compared to like a normal plastic yeah yeah he's right that is what it feels like it was really cool to see that actually for blue pH material it aligns with the circular economy it is from nature and ends to the nature we did a a calculation on the carbon footprint versus the conventional plastic PS and even with uh paper so we can see that we can reduce huge amount of the carbon foodprint versus the current material all this is based on our technology and the core team our cofounders are from the top universities in China and the core team is fromal companies and Industry experts and we also have a very good platform we call it Sy OS just like color OS for opal and we can uh can uh realize the the string uh stren screening and uh to the product development High effectively and this is the plant we built in y you can see wind we can use the green electricity and this is the first phase is 5,000 uh tons per year and we have plans to extend to uh 75,000 tons per year in the next W these guys are growing fast but start 2016 and I believe that hand in hand with opal we can you know build a better planet and make this world I'm here guys in Singapore thank you thank you blue for anyone just tuning in I'm in like a live streaming room the event happening like outside it's like 200 met away so after this I'll go out and like see everyone but now I'm like just streaming the event my question is regarding the manufacturing process uh what kind of waste and uh byproduct would come from this process and uh how do you deal with it yeah actually thanks for your question and uh it's a fermentation process so the most important thing is that we could you know separate the pH with the microorganism and in this part that the waste water will created from the process so our top priority is to treat the Water waste waste water during the process and we have already buil a uh Waste Water treatment uh sub plant in in the area so we will use use this to treat the Water waste thank you that's the M waste that's impressive yeah guys that's pretty cool I was messing with this at the booth thank you for the presentation I have a quick question capital expenditure I saw you have the plan to more than 10x your current capacity uh 3 4 years so could you comment on that what's the cap needed and billions of dollars oh my God yeah actually currently the land has already provided by the government so we can utilize this land uh that's interesting help from advantage and also we have already accumulated some funding from from the in China so that we can uh leverage the the the the benefit of the capitals to build our further uh projects yeah so so government collaboration I guess that makes sense because it's super sustainable yeah there was $300 million wow you mentioned uh some customizability in the formulations often when you're working with polymer polymers you need low molecular weight monomers for plasticizers exactly what I'm was going to ask and those can leech out uh into the water uh do you need these additives or in your customization process can you achieve the different materials properties that you need yeah actually PHA is a family uh material and we use uh different uh we we scen out a particular micr to produce this uh material and uh uh actually this material currently is the uh the best material we found in in this family yeah but you don't need to add any additional monomers to your material to achieve the right properties uh mechanical properties Yes actually we can adjust the second monomer in the uh in the uh molecular to achieve different kind of uh the the harness or or other properties thank you all right I have no idea what that means guys that's a bit beyond my my biology knowledge but hi just a Qui sounds it good question uh in terms of the commercializing since um it was indicated that the company was established in 2016 so any track records that you may share with us so far the the commercialized right yes means um the previous um products um by using the key technologies that you mentioned in the presentation yeah actually just like you see on the video we have already made the straws that and also cies that fit for the you know Environmental Protection yeah those were interesting I was playing with them will be a big Market they feel a bit weird butt create more lifestyle to the consumer so if you go to our booth we create the fibers and also the 3D printing so that it could be leverage the material property to create more you know markets so this material they made it 3D printable and they have a bunch of like figurines and stuff theyd and they have like col boxes it was pretty I was pretty impressed how much stuff they actually were able to make the link so this one I think is like probably one of the more established companies that's here but I mean there R $300 million guys that's insane from 2016 they built their own plant um um yeah if if they get those government relationships like they say they have they can grow super quickly right fromy progam for preventing by the way the weather is hot oh my God it's like 30° and so humid here compared to Canada all right let me get my notes for this one online Therapy Program for preventing myo FAS sheld I'm not sure how you say that pain syndrome and chronic pain these guys are pre Ser A2 do you feel stiffness do you have neck and shoulder pain yes definitely oh my God you guys probably have that too problem call office syndrome hi my name is Ben from the tical team an accessible and efficient solution for curing office syndrome do you believe that in the next 20 year people could look like this with the rapid growth in technology our body can keep it's going to be me in like 5 years guys suffer from Office syndrome muscle issues it's lower the productivity and sleep problem chronic pain and burnout syndrome not only it caused the pain to our body but it caused 3,860 economic lost really what we do to fix the problem right now wonder how they measured that we use pills needle and massage but how much more time we need to do in order to be Kure it's non continuous can fall off and have high cost like sitting up straight time for everyone vertical is here to make curing effective and efficient by check and train track then motivate H if you want to prevent and relief you can first come to perform a flexibility test AI poster shck up then you will get a personal Live program just for you with a ergonomically designed animation and pce matching tricks and white description you can follow it if your eye are closed if you go to the clinic to see physiotherapist uh our our partner Clinic can scan the QR code you show to them and then send you a personal light plan to the phone this way you can help improve the treatment efficiency a lot we also have an HR solution starting from a training then use article to create a personaliz and trackable plan we also have a reward program to keep employee motivated then if the employee learning to trat we can connect them to our partner clinics oh so this is meant for like is not just system where we have partner like HR solution yeah see that um Fitness and hospital they can use ero with their customer safely that we can also recommend and personalize our partner product to our users we have a user in 59 count with around 500 user around the world mly active users okay 500 that's pretty low for now guys they're like brand new with around 8 to 10 minute of Engagement time we have post test with our users and they got better after using ero 91% we have Jo Thailand hrx this year and we won a mer award for pitching then got around 150 Prospect we have four main competive advantage first alra personalization we can personalize the stretch to any kind of activities and lifestyle because we have various kind of assets and is highly customizable in the pace and length second is safe is safe safety because our expert design it one by one yeah and we can use it safely then it's trackable it can be used as tracking to for the use for the experts then it can redeem a real life reward starting in Thailand when compared to our compor we are more complete in term of treatments the market size is calculated to be 820 million that's it a business model like this we do a premier model everyone can download and then we with the slides here PR with a B2B customer we're working with a partner like Fitness Clinic looks like they're charging 59 is that per month or per year I wish bring that slide back I want to see what for insurance we are working with them to create a sponsorship where we can use artical with the customer and they can access to their selfcare data our go to make a strategy we are trying to increase the user right now and then the partner and B2B customer will come yeah they need more users toate goal is to be an SD for tele medicine and healthare system to create a UniFi muscle care experience for everyone so they want to like integrate with a bunch other prods and a 10 goal of sdg we want to make sure that everyone including the visual impair have access to muscle selfcare do you know that there is 1 billion which impair user around the world but they cannot use Fitness video and fitness media to take care of their muscles oh so they can use article because we have P matching wi description they can follow it even if they can see weuse to re up Corporation we want to use an oper panel system to the ople system that create to create the connection in the internet of experience along with a device like ople oel and opo bands how imagine at this event you sit a lot you use your phone a lot then we can personalize the stretch for you we can personalize and shoulder stretch and lower back stretch to the smart widget on your oper phone and at they should do that they should have done like a demo here that would be cool U monitor the help result and then we can use that to improve the algorithm of personalization this way a can help improve the preventive care in the opo ecosystem here is the implementation plan we will first explore the Pano system and see which data we can use to recommend the stretch then we will try to launch kind of beta testing next year is is possible the journey forward if we got the 5K Grant we will accelerate the process of SDK development for healthcare and tele medicine we'll do CSR development to create a solution self caring for visually impair then we'll expand and raise an awareness of this condition to the world we have a strong team in both Business technical and healthc care specialist we are ready to make your muscle healthy thank you well thank you team that kind of fits with the tie backg think Mass you mentioned you have 500 monthly active users um can you share what is the most used feature on the app yeah def is the stretching so most of the users tend to stretch in the neck and shoulder because it's the muscle that is easily strained yeah look like everyone watching exercise yeah we have an ergonomically designed animation it's the pace is going to match let's say when you want to relieve your muscle you need to stretch at least 10 or 15 second if you stret like 3 second it's not going to release the muscle yeah so that's how it work right now just follow along with some video or some guided stretch okay interesting idea but mentioned that you're to exit by developing an SDK and integrating this into a larger infrastructure um wondering what is your strategic advantage against your competitor I guess it's not in the app itself or the this guy good questions but in the content or the way that you're delivering that content yeah yeah so um we start by um exploring like a tie traditional stretching techniques so we focus on Mak sense not like the stretch that you need to take a yoga M and take like an hour of stretch we focus on the stretch that can be integrated in your life when you sit when you go to the toilet when you work when you at your share so the thing that we try to do is try to make it personalize to you like you get the music personalize playlist we have a personaliz stretching list that you can incorporate into your daily life and make your body work with the Le less least amount of efficience I'm not really understanding how they personalize that too much you like go in person or something mentioned um AI algorithms as being a source of improving the solution where do you get your training data from from the initial outset I would say right now we use an open source to detect the post right now yeah but the way we recommend we still use the condition where it's on like we try on thousand of research to do which thing because right now I think to recommend the data we need to base on the will and meal reseearch to recommend which um exercise match with each muscle but the AI we use to detect the post and skeleton yeah interesting I don't think you really answered the question mention um your one of your business model is B2 B2 c will you be able to illustrate a little bit more for this B2B it's just a app or you will just combine together with some off uh SDK he's talking about with your partners or clinics Etc yeah so B2B we mainly focus on the HR solution when we go to do a training for the employees okay and then after they do a training each one of the employee have different condition we will okay this employee have a neck and shoulder problem this one have this this um person have a leg problem so each one going to have a personalized and trackable plan so that our expert who do a training can uh follow up and really make an efficient training to the company like would you guys want this let let me know in the chat if you guys would actually use something like this or not approach and B2B solution right now it seems interesting like if your company said give this you for free would you guys actually use this like day today I don't know I might try it but don't know seems tough like online app I'd like to know their uh retention rate on on people right 91% of people said improve how many kept that's probably the most important for something like this let me know what you guys think in the chat here if you guys have questions uh put them in here I'll answer them as much as I can for anyone just tuning in I'm in Singapore right now this is a live event next going to be one more have a small break for AI Inc Froman with the proposal easy speech easy speech all right let's hear this one these guys have raised 40K no 400k us they're in preseries a 2023 brand new startup 11 to 15 employees speech is one of the most important and fundamental skills for both individual large we express our feelings using words we defend our position using verbal communication we connect with people by speaking to them we remember the day when our kids said their first word there are over 100 million people worldwide with various speech disorders including kids with cerebal Psy autism Down syndrome adults during poststroke Rehabilitation and Parkinson and unfortunately and unfortunately there is a uh lack of speech therapist everywhere in the world waiting list is uh in US is three months Germany is six is crazy trying to find these even for free fees are not affordable for families from lowincome communities insurance if any all covers only limited number of sessions and there is also uh no personalization to the tratment uh both parents and therapist lacked objective data to uh monitor the programs and if let's face it it's um difficult for kids to do boring exercises so easy speech uh will uh uh eliminate waiting list uh and we will transform the therapy into fun games for kids we also equip uh therapist with a powerful tool to customize the treatment plan based on the robot robust data and reports and all this at affordable price available anywhere anytime easy speech like uh human therapists only dig take a look at the sample video and do the same it's guys to use it throughout the entire process move tongue lower assesses accur performance provides feedback and generates reports and recommendations there are a lot of speech apps on the market but all of them are limited to demonstration of exercises and maybe one US covers limited sound assessments whereas most or many of the uh Speech disorders require initially to develop oral motor apparatus and F motoric the only one which covers both oral motor and sound practices and we are the only one which assesses the accuracy of performance do personalization realtime feedback and uh data and Reporting we have developed our application for children with children with the speech therapist and their parents we also trained our neural network on the kids and adults of varied age ethnicity and gender to minimize bias assessment and uh furthermore we have a controllable I AI our algorithms are highly customizable specific face parameters and individual abilities our business model is B2 b2c we planed the we plan that the app will be distributed uh primarily through the speech centers and rehabs uh initially we were concentrated only on b2c but all Pilots we had confirm a strong interest from institutional users to use the app as inhouse simulator and a tool for remote patient and monitoring those very interest you prescrib this from your doors generated by the app speech therapist I guess they will the clinics will be able to increase the number of patient Serv uh which will increase their revenues but also it will decrease uh the operating expenses because we will save up to 25% of time currently spent on paperwork but at the same time introduction of hibrid method of treatment will decrease the cost to the patient by 40% because they need less treatment I guess that's interesting I wonder how much they charge for this 19 mimic exercises covering uh tongue lips Joe's and brows and a model with over 200 uh sound practices assessing sounds at the beginning middle and end of the world we have collected and labeled our unique database data sets and we have achieved Precision accuracy and recall rate in the range of 70 to 90 in the lab and in the pilots we have been conducted for year and a half in various speech centers and rehabs and we filed a Pon application and start initiated C Mark preparation uh once we complete GPR compliance which is hopefully going to be uh this October uh we're going to launch as a Fitness and Wellness application but the plan is to get certified as a medical um device and uh to sign the contract with uh corporate uh users in 2024 and in 2025 to get FDA approval to get to US market but ultimate goal to become a plat matching platform between the therapist and the patients okay that makes more sense to me best prct ice worldwide you go on there they collect your data and then they send you the appropriate spee one of them uh we believe and we are piloting our solution in several markets including us uh UK and Spain uh so the uh uh we can be we believe that we can achieve breaking within seven months after we hit active uh 400 active users what is their price per user there because the waiting list is ion of people we don't see any problem achieving that number our funding needs is uh $2 million primarily to do certification process and clinical trials to get to the you and we can greatly benefit with OPP hey guys uh do productization especially performance enhancements on their mobile uh for form as for strategy well uh self driving cars and cashierless stores are already there so imagine our product our application on uh your devices helping elderly people somewhere in the Care Facility or imagine a self uh uh self trining class in a school for kids with disability uh and your devices have you imagine well we already have they have that like an English class or something that could be interesting we can do something together with Oppo in China Asia and worldwide we are the global team with global Ambitions supported by Leading mentors from Healthcare institutions they're all over the place and Europe and we will be a great feed for Oppo nice that was interesting thank you so much and now you have two minutes for Q&A judges please I'm curious how well that actually works right like how effective is an app when you're trying to learn the real time feedback I think is the biggest Advantage i' say syy with OP products yes we believe that uh our app can be installed on the devices of op whether it's a tabs or mobile phones and that that can be implemented uh as a consumer product at home but also in the hospital rehabilitation centers um so that we we believe that there is something Oppo can uh definitely benefit uh as well I don't really see the Deep integration with Oppo here unless they just like sponsor them and and and help them grow right because it's just an app you can download on like any device City I mean just now you mentioned China is one of your biggest target market have you done any trial in China yet uh not not in China unfortunately we have done Africa Asia and um Europe us but not in China you said Asia but like what country um if that say um you are expanding in China will you consider to get a more international team to create uh versions of your uh different languages uh oh that's a good point actually yeah they needed all the languages question the thing is with the oral motor we have two modules oral motor exercises which basically development of the tongue lips Jaws etc those uh are the same in every languages we've noticed whether it's Africa or us or Germany there's no we need to retrain the neural network to recognize uh Mandarin or languages in countries that's not an easy task okay uh version they have to retrain the whole model in another language I don't know if that's ideal had this Oppo uh competition in Bangkok we got a call from Bangkok uh they are interested as well in Thailand all right thank you so much Mila for AI Inc for your wonderful proposal that was interesting it's kind of all over the place for me easy spe and of like that is a huge huge issue I can remember like at elementary school kids going to like you know a little classroom to like work on their speech right not being able to pronounce so can you imagine being able to actually just do that from an app if that's actually effective and then if you need more then you go to a speech pathologist or whatever they said rather than paying for that up front when like a consultation could be like a few hundred I know in Canada like people spend thousands of dollars that so they I don't know if they said how much their app cost though I would like to see how much the price is if it's one time fee if it's a subscription what their pricing model is paper batteries this is solution safer more sustainable and cost efficient future when it comes to Battery tech but before I get into that I want to tell you why we need them this cuz have zero funding so far boing and that's only a 2% decrease in the past 20 years 2% that has been converted into green energy now when we think about green energy we often you know think about solar panels windmills and so on but what we often don't realize is the infrastructure that's required to enable that switch to Green energy and a huge part of that infrastructure is batteries but here's the catch the batteries that we currently use and the metals that we use in them are not only toxic but very scarse as well so if you run the numbers H is recycling initiatives while they're Noble are nothing but a shortterm BandAid solution so if you really want that 2% to become 20 or even 50% in the future given how material intensive our current battery Tech is we are never getting there so a dream of a Greener future demands Greener batteries and that's precisely where Flint's paper batteries come in now I want to he this sounds cool all batteries are rechargeable and they work pretty much the same same way as traditional batteries do but what we have done is to use different materials we have come up with what we call hydrogen reinforced cellulose paper and utilize zinc and manganese as the two sides of the battery and thanks to our proprietary Tech and knowledge we have unlocked three new features that you have never seen before in any other Battery tech all right this got me excited our batteries are fully compostable now okay let's give this a moment while this doesn't have paper batteries that's probably why it's not working that well that's funny it needs a flint battery and this is not clicking can I have some help with this okay there it goes so these are all batteries that are fully compostable which means at the end of its life cycle you could throw it away into the soil and within a month it would completely degrade and really that's not to say that we want everyone to start throwing our batteries around but it does make it a whole lot easier and cheaper to recycle them and that reduces the environmental impact significantly now paper that's something that you guys have in your hands right now you know how light and flexible it is and this gives our batteries its adaptive design and just to prove our point we have designed our batteries in the shape of the Singapore M emblem as well now our batteries can be bent while it's functional without affecting its performance or causing any kind safety hazard and when we talk about hazards like in terms of where you could actually put that moves around the battery we went one step further to show you how safe our batteries are by cutting them while it's an operation and it didn't overheat imagine doing with a real battery to work corrosive normal it's not real battery other type batter all we have to do because of this adaptive design is to build our batteries in the required shape and size and stack them up and you would practically have a plug and place solution to replace any type of lithium batteries that are out there right now so you just layer them because of how production friendly our batteries are in order to make them we don't have to reinvent the wheel we can use existing manufacturing processes and equipment to make this possible and the best part is given how abundant the raw materials that we use are the cost of making our batteries is 10 times cheaper than traditional batteries wow now that's a huge game changer because think about it if you going to put our battery on a 2X two Matrix against other Battery tech you'd realize that not only is ours one of the most sustainable but also one of the most cost efficient options that are out there and that makes us the most practical solution in the market I'm curious how many you actually need though to get the same power output's see if and using industry standard metric this is how our batteries perform today volumetric how expect it energy density and we start toize it and build this in scale now you have to that we're not just comparing here we're pioneering but given the current performance of our batteries we decided to come up with three specialized versions of paper batteries for a focused area of application so that we can either match or outperform lithium batteries in these areas so when it comes to cost and safety we're already much further ahead and when we want to increase the capacity within a limited volume we can use paper batteries in energy storage systems we're working together with Collinson power is one of Singapore's largest energy storage system providers to make this happen now when we want to reduce the weight and the volume you can start to see paper batteries in your everyday consumer products your your phones your wearables and remote senses working together with Technics company to replace the batteries in the remote sensors for explosives now those are tiny batteries when we try to increase the capacity but decrease the weight at the same time and you finally have the dream of having green batteries in your EVS so one day you could be driving an EV that's not only cheaper but safer and a whole lot more sustainable now the team that's build all the team that's building this has over 30 years of management experience and expertise in areas like Material Science mechanical design Advanced physics among others and we are being supported by individuals from some of the top universities governmental organizations and even companies like shell backing us up and all this is because at Flint we want to be powering the future not just any future but a Greener future and to make this possible we want to work together with you now over the next 3 years our conservative Revenue estimate lies at about 160 million and that's expected to grow 20 times by 2030 as we explore into new markets out there so we want to invite you to join us on this transformative Journey as we're looking for partnership opportunities and collaborative designes so if you're ready to build that Greener future we have Fint and we're eager to connect with you thank you thank you that was that was that's one of the better presentations I think that they gave it was very clear I understand exactly what he means but I don't I want to see the size of a battery relevant to uh compared to a normal quick the several key parameters of the batteries including capacity uh charging speed yeah sure so let's say for a 1 by 1 cm size of battery paper battery that we have the voltage is about 1.5 to 2 volts and we're pushing that to three as you speak and the capacity that it has is about 35 milliamp so scale it up to about the battery that you saw in the video earlier I'm not sure if you recall but the one that was powering the fan that is about 350 milliamp of capacity it's pretty one thin slice of paper battery I want to see like a side by side parameters do you have a road map of what kind of applications to go first and uh finally go to the EV right okay so the beach hit Market that we're targeting right now is 18650 battery Beach hit Market that we're targeting right now is 18650 batteries because based on the current performance of our batteries we feel that that's the best way to go forward and we're working together with Collins and powers to bring paper batteries into energy storage systems so backup generators for buildings that's the first Beach hit that makes s we don't have a huge size speak in 2024 when we move forward to the pilot production stage now that we're done with R&D what is going to happen is that we are opening up to a lot of companies like opo and all these other companies that I mentioned earlier we're opening up to them to see how we can bring paper batteries into these various products and if we see value and a lot of demand in that particular sector we would move forward there as well interesting thank you think it seems really I I just want to see the size of it because I don't know if it actually would fit in like a smartphone that's a very good question so lithium batteries over 2,000 life cycles so that's about like six years of using that battery right let's say in your phone or any other use case over 2,000 life cycles the efficiency drops down to about 70% our batteries over 1,000 life cycles because it takes a long time to test these out has dropped to only 80% so in terms of efficiency and life cycle we're slightly on the lower end but as we move to its commercialization these numbers are going to improve significantly so it's worse from that but not by a lot so much Flint for your wonderful proposal judges please score that was pretty good guys I like that one I think it was a good presentation but again I just they're so new they don't really have enough information to to say like how impactful the battery can actually be if you could put that in an EV that'd be huge right cuz I'm not sure if you guys have seen the impact of actually making like a battery that goes into the EV is it pretty much completely diminishes the whole point of having an EV actually make that type battery nonsurgical hearing aid nonsurgical hearing aid they they do have a real sample guys they have one in the uh the demo area but I don't know if they have time to do that on stage so I did see it but it's kind of hard right we have a little slight like it's not very visual to actually tell uh how good it is but that was a good presentation all right who are we on now good afternoon everyone so today we are here to share the music of song We Are R and lexman from start he's got to move the mic up to his mouth there there you go children close to me close so this is a problem we are going to solve so you were not able to hear us for few seconds and you became worried imagine the millions of children who cannot be able to hear all their life so meet Mr Sund he was born without the ability to hear medically known as congenital hearing loss we call them severe and profound hearing loss so there's a lots of hearing devices available in the market like BTC devices ITC devices or bone conduction devices so those devices doesn't help him the only solution for a Sunder and millions of children like him around the world is Cocker implants so Cocker implants are fixed by the means of open skull surgery oh my but it has a many problems mainly it require a highrisk open skull surgery and it's very very expensive it can cost up to $115,000 per implant and it's very risky per implant during a surgery it even caus a brain infection nerve damage and even a facial sound like a reasonable solution the hearing a implantation the patient have to lead a restrictive lives like they cannot take an MRI they cannot use a smartphone they cannot do adventure sports and surgery is also ruled out after the age of eight so it is not a small problem globally 1.7 million childrens are born with a congenital hearing loss every year so for them we at backat creators have inverted the world's first nonsurgical hearing device for congenital hearing loss patients our product is called impulse so no more parents need to drill their children's SK for hearing we are completely 1100 USD is still pretty expensive hearing Los signicant there is no risk while using our product they can still take a life saving dnos service such as M at last our device is highly affordable able we are reduced the cost from over $115,000 to $1,00 still a lot but that's nonallergic silicon composite it can be easily removable without any surgical intervention so the Simplicity of our Technologies our biggest strength we are using a patented method of applying a electromagnetic stimulation where we are providing electromagnetic stimulation directly to the co COA is the inner ear organ so by providing that we are stimulating the sensory neurons of the ccka by doing that we are making them here without having any internal implantation surgeries these guys raised 125k by the way us they're 2021 providing our a continuous speech therapy to recognize the sounds that they are hearing for a first time so we have MVP ready we have successfully clinically piloted with 50 plus patients and we have a two International pattern for our earing a technology so our research work is also backed by a doctor Milan K highly awarded ENT surgeon of India who done a 3,000 plus implant surgeries by the way guys all the demos and stuff I'm going to show you some of them I'm making a video that I'm going post on the channel in a few days and you'll see some of the stuff like the demo area I'll show you over 30 million childrens required a hearing aid implant to treat their hearing loss so they can readily op our device non surgical one so here is our business model so these four primary stakeholders are going to be our potential resellers or a distributor Partners yeah stay tuned guys if you I have a travel Vlog coming on a few video days I'm share this yeah look at that wow can you imagine being like here for the first time that' be crazy yeah look at his eyes so you may notice the children said book from the bir he doesn't hear a single sound and also he doesn't speak while using our device for a first time from the book we Are enabled them to hear through our device and also on providing a continuous speech therapy to them we are also enable them to speak so here is our team we are Raman and lakman working on the product development for last 3 years holding multiple patterns in the hering a technology it's very impressive advisory team who over 50 plus years of a combined experience in Audiology Acoustics and medical device development so we are going to sell our product at the cost of $900 to a B2 b2c model that's a better price competitive landscape what is the alternate solution which is available in the market which is a implant it requires a highrisk open skull surgery so what value we are going to deliver to a patient is nonsurgical which suit for all ages with zero restriction at a very affordable cost so here is our Milestone and timeline for Regulatory and certification Pathways Q7 so here's a phot giving demonstration to head of wh when he visit she visited our testing lab so we would like to Leverage The strength of Oppo in manufacturing and distribution footprint in our target market so we sees there are four areas we can have a Synergy between Oppo and impulse devices mainly a sound quality our device work well in the silent zone so we wish to enhance the sound quality and hearing by a big computational Power that Oppo smartphone have with the conjunction of our device and affordability as Oppo positioning as a most affordable smartphone it's a perfect partner for us to provide a lowcost and affordable solution to a developing countries in Asia including India and we are reducing the hardware eliminating the need of additional Hardwares like a transmitters and tele coils by having our core key technology of BL integration with the smartphone and we are also providing a value addition features like Wireless connectivity noise reduction battery level management and calibration of a hearing devices through the Oppo smartphone I would like to see the battery on that strongly believes that together with Oppo smartphone and impulse device we can make a beautiful world for the childrens with the hearing disability and we are also achieving a STG goal three directly with this good health and wellbeing and indirectly a goal 4 8 10 with the empowering the individuals with hearing disability so we have our functional prototype which even we can you can feel the sound how the the children can able to sh without any I didn't check that in the demo I'm going to look at that after cuz I actually want to see what that's like oh he has it here thank you so much while you now have 1 minute 25 seconds for Q&A judges please oh I guess they're going to miss the demo there that's too bad hello guys you mentioned the clinical trials yes obviously as soon as you put the impulse uh sensor on there will be level of hearing but have you been able to track the level of hearing and the development of those patients and how long does it take to take them through the process these guys have good questiona it's really a good question so hearing and learning are a both a different thing so what clinical study which we have done is completely medically framed one which is called C method so CP is a method to assess whether they can able to hear the sound in a multiple levels so it is done for for the 2 months long duration with the multiple patient category so all these childrens doesn't get benefited through the traditional devices so they only suits for Implant but they can use our device and they can provide it with the speech therapy for 2 months post that they can able to hear the sound through our device and also they can discriminate those sounds through our device also post hearing sir okay that makes sense they can actually tell the difference between the sounds not like they just hear some random vibration right is the TMS technology suitable for uh all kinds of people with heing L or just certain types sir actually we are focusing only for severe and profund Sir so for the other types like a mild and moderate there's lots of hearing devices which is already available as you seen b the year devices buts like devices OTC devices un bone conduction devices are already available in the market to help thems but the this congenital hearing loss they only get treated with the implant that's the only ideal solution available across the world so we like to replace that with the nonsurgical sir so that's why we are only focusing on replacing this congenital hearing loss but still it can help the other patient also by doing some internal customization in a hardw I think hopefully he answer your question there who in the chat here talking about your brother backyard creators judges please I think the science is a bit more complicated than I can for you a link in the Des you can read the full proposals if you want more information on how it works that one was cool again it's it's hard to see the value when like I can hear right I don't know what it's like to to be deaf or to know someone like that but very interesting if it actually would allow someone to hear like a full sentence I get that you can hear noises pleas welcome but I'm curious if you can make out words if You' actually have legit communication they can move towards that this is massive especially in Asia where you can't like a $15,000 implant that's massive you sell something for like 600 $900 yeah Irving uh from the chat have a look at the the link in the description there there's some more information I think you could also probably just look up their their project we'll see but that's quite cool okay what are we on now what was the most Mo the disruptive electronic technology there you go that you guys witnessed in the last few years any guesses so by end of this presentation I'll convince you our technology wire fits the bill for such a let's look at the funding on these guys this one's kind of crazy 10 million usies to send High speeed data through human skin hi I'm perer I'm head of partnership for aana and let's talk about the magic of wi it's like a new WiFi protocol guys or I guess implementation I'm not sure if you uh sorry so if you think about um a technology that can increase the battery life of devices let's say headphone from 4 hours to 20 hours what will be the impact on the EWaste that batteries generate so our technology because it's 100 times more efficient than Bluetooth and WiFi can essentially achieve their target really how much usage does WiFi have our technology because it's more efficient can allow smaller form factor for the devices which actually reduces uh plastic waste also the technology because it's more efficient we can have devices that can be virtually charging free or in some cases they need smaller battery and that helps the environment and that is good for mother Earth now uh what is wire so you can think of it as um electronic analog of a nerve how we actually send the data from our brain to our different senses now if you think about a human body we have one processor and we have uh several senses but if you think about uh all the devices all around our uh physical system like Smartwatch you have a phone you have XR VR devices they all each have a processor there now they have multiple brains so why do we need that because the speed between the devices is currently slow and also it's not very power eff efficient however with our technology which is 100 times more efficient than Bluetooth and WiFi we can change that Paradigm and bring about distributed computing architecture that will make the size of those uh devices much much smaller wow now so what communicate with is a new communication technology that allows us to send data along any surface for example human skin really now imagine I have a headphone and and my friend who has a headphone also uh is listening to music through a streaming through let's say a smartphone if I I touch that person or I come near that now I can listen to the same music that is a science fiction and but this is there's no way that's anymore through our wire technology okay I need to try that I need reality hope I hope they have that in Demon this okay I'm going to check that out after guys I'm going to I'll post an Instagram story or something that's crazy if that actually works now if you think about how uh let's say I just like touch someone's hand you can hear the song they're listening to way head through Bluetooth I guess you have and so only very small amount of energy is actually being converted to send the data however our technology through yr chip we actually conf find the data around a bubble around our body which means we need very less amount of energy so intuitively you can think of why we are more efficient compared to WiFi and Bluetooth now this is not a chart this is an actual data test on our production chip our chip is already uh commercialized that gives 100 times more energy now think about it think about any field when was the last time you heard about 100 times Improvement in efficiency G almost never happens especially in technology so we launched our chip just nine months ago at CES in 2023 we received best NCS award wow right at that event couple million contract from some customers and till this date we have closed $7.5 Million worth of contracts in just last N9 months have a ton of sales for that smartphone companies device manufacturers in us and all around the world are either evaluating our technology or in the process of uh integrating into next generation of devices and we are fairly confident you'll see a device powered by our technology in 2024 I'm curious if that means you have to change a bunch of stuff from the develop perspective building a smart class hopefully not see that will increase the Barry Life For That device from 2 hours to 12 hours so that's a huge huge uh uh Barry uh bar love so uh this company has uh investment from Samsung uh Ro who actually brought the Bluetooth the market Market is also part of the investment team uh Tony Chi who invented Google Glass is also an investor holens team if which understand the problem with the weight and the heat associated with those XR and VR devices we can actually address those problems wow this one's cool guys it's probably one of my favorite ones so far this is a little what that demonstrates what is this communicate with touch let's see this guys if that actually works like that's crazy okay let me I need to try that after how that's so okay that's really cool that was a good marketing video they have there yeah thank you and if you have any questions please talk to us I have the demo there if you want to partner with us I would love to have a conversation with you guys thank you team you have can I touch you and you subscribe to my channel Jud uh yeah uh actually I have met you uh during the mwc oh okay yeah and uh my question is that how about the cost compared with the Bluetooth and WiFi this is a premium product it's more expensive giving 100 times performance schem so that's about to be expected thank you he didn't say the cost though but it's a lot more expensive interest um are these mostly from wearables from reducing borri perspective on how do you what are the sort of most use cases you're getting bount interest for at this point yeah I'll give you an example there's a medical company which is like they have this device for continuous glucose monitoring so they have to charge it for every three uh 3 days or 7 days something like that because our par consumption is so low we don't need charging for it anymore we can just stick in a small cell battery that'll just power it for a year so that just changes the game tremendously yeah no charging for gluc if you look at all the devices uh XR VR and those devices because we are doing the compute on those devices but if you can offload that compute to a smartphone which everybody carries the weight of the devices will go down the only reason it can be done is there's a highspeed connectivity in those devices and a smartphone so basically it's a distributed computing architecture that actually changes the game now for examp both the smartphone and the device need smart helmet uh they had a camera in the helmet and this was for industrial use case and they were wanting to run AI on the uh the on the vision the computer data that they were gathering through the uh camera but the weight of the helmet became twice the workers said we can't wear it because it's a giant battery you're carrying on a house when they used our technology we just only the weight increase by few grams so and also they don't have to have a uh very uh complex Electronics because it has just a camera and our board and rest of the processing is happening on a standard Android op phone for example so it just changes the game tremendously so that's why this is we feel it is one of the most disruptive technology and we believe that it's going to end up in your smartphones for next uh even if it is expensive that's still like if one smartphone has thank you for your fantastic presentation I am curious to see how much more expensive actually is lower energy y connect lower but how much more expensive and media friends please vote via the media Choice link thank you guys that's that's a cool one I really want to try that I want to see the like the music things I mean that's kind of more of a novelty right like you really need to do that no but um that's really really interesting I'll try to post something uh and at least I'm going to have a travel Vlog coming out soon I'll I'll put in that something about this presentation or some of the other ones some of other demos cuz there's quite a few really cool ones there I think we're going to break shortly um let's see what are we what are we on right now eight I have a whole schedule here so much teams and that was an invigorating morning of we have aak thanks to all our first eight teams so now it is time for a well earned break for everyone so we have te break for all of you outside please do enjoy them and return at 345 p.m. 345 p.m. sharp thank you so much and I'll see all of you later thank you okay guys so let's go to the chat now um let's talk about some of the presentations also I want to hear your comments if you guys have anything to say put it in the chat I'm going to be focusing on just reading chat and responding to that let me turn down the music actually it's not too loud I think that's fine if it's too loud guys let me know but yeah this is in Singapore guys I'm here right now uh like this is right outside I have a bunch of footage of it um I can't show you where I am cuz the camera is set up but it's right outside okay chat what are you guys saying uh I had a glucose monitor changeed my life is type one it'd be nice to have it just part of a smoke phone yeah I don't know if it'd be just part of a smartphone but I think the idea is that it'd be a lot lighter and you don't need to charge it anymore you imagine like you don't need to charge the monitor like it just works forever or for a year or two years and you just swap it the battery I think that's the big thing even the example he was talking about with the helmet there where like you don't need to have a 10 lb battery in your helmet you make it a few grams uh hi everyone just got home from work hi Tim hey guys thanks for tuning into the stream have any questions let me know um obviously this will be available on YouTube after for you guys to watch what do you think about the invention in Android phone industry in The Last 5 Years uh inventions it's crazy I mean Android is yeah I like dude just technology in general 5 years it it's been crazy the kind of stuff that we've seen think about it the internet wasn't even really around what 20 25 years ago and look what we have now hey Tim I want some project ideas for my college I wants to make something unique Innovative product development related to software Ai and ml we keep watching this then because you've already seen all the Innovative stuff they have obviously you're not going to be able to do something to this level I mean these are startups with expert level teams PhD doctorates you know sometimes in one case $300 million in funding um yeah I don't know what you would want to do for AI and ml there's a lot of cool computer vision stuff I really like doing the visual type of applications even hence you've seen some of these presentations like the visually captivating ones are always interesting do I work for Oppo no I've just partnered with them they actually brought me here to Singapore I've been working with the team uh to live stream this event I'm going to be here tomorrow as well they're releasing a new smartphone I don't know how much I can share about that but I'm going to have a video out soon that's going to share my whole kind of travel journey to Singapore it's my first time in Asia here and um yeah you guys are going to see the real Tim traveling around not just sitting at an office this has been such a cool opportunity though and then obviously this event is sweet get to meet all these people here and I'm like the little celebrity in in the live stream room which is funny uh what else you guys say here well many monitors I use after week I'm not sure the difference I guess I missed most of that presentation yeah so these monitors uh in terms of the battery life it's saying I don't know I think it's like the plugin thing just the actual monitoring I don't know chip you don't need to charge anymore is what they're saying I'm just hearing of Oppo Oppo is a massive smartphone brand in Asia guys it's not really big in US and Canada I think they have some subsidiary companies that they own but it's not uh it's not so big over there but in Asia this is massive I mean like what they gave me like a little Oppo like tablet type thing here that I've been using to read some of the live chat and it's a pretty affordable brand from what I've been able to tell and uh they have this cool like kind of fold phone and again I don't know how much I can talk with that so be careful but yeah uh the gaming industry is booming all the world I have gears for racing use Python s cheaper okay I'm not sure what you're saying there what else have you guys asked hey guys let me know what you think of this so far kind of you know a new thing for the channel but this has been really fun just to sit back and just comment on these how to Vision a plan for college project research so I won't waste time I think you have to validate an idea right I think a lot of these companies what they've done well is that they actually have a bunch of users people that are actually interested in their product and they very quickly validate what do they want what do they not want rather than building something or working on something that no one wants you got to figure out very quickly does someone actually want this this has been really interesting yeah I think so as well again a new thing on the channel but I hope you guys are enjoying it we've got another seven seven presentations seven or eight presentations after the break some more really interesting ones um that are coming up so far I'll say like the coolest one for me is still that haptic one guys the demo is just honestly it was really impressive cuz I thought it was going to be a new type of sensor like a proprietary controller but it's not like it's the same Tech that you guys have right now in your pocket but it feels immersive like it's almost like they just threw in like a subwoofer in a surround sound system and I feel like I can experience the audio uh they gave me a VR headset and they gave me like a controller and on a screen it was like this what do you call it like a bunch of cars for example and you can feel the gear change you can feel um all the revs really cool someone's from crotia here nice man uh how can I solo project to all over the world I don't know what you mean there when will we have a generative AI for 3D modeling so there's actually a 3D project coming up a really cool camera kind of 3D project let me see I have a little notes thing here I'll read through some of them 3D interactive platform haptic Solutions we already saw that one biobased solutions for flexible Electronics contactless Health monitoring ecofriendly packaging for Oppo smartphones the online therapy easy speech Flint paper battery was another big one too they're super early but the that was interesting impulse nonsurgical hearing aid actually we've seen a lot of these how many more do we have I think we've already seen maybe 10 of them project eight yeah we've already seen eight oh no we've seen eight okay um mind mind lacks Health technology orbit Precision psychiatrics Psychiatry sorry at scale Sky light Define the Next Generation displays woa we got a bunch of cool ones coming up guys let's see what you're saying here uh what is your suggestion for a somewhat beginner student who also wants to do what they're doing like what language do I start learning in Concepts like from a development perspective it depends what you want to build I always say figure out what it is you actually want to make first and then pick the Technology based on that but as a beginner you might want to start out with something simple right Python and JavaScript is usually what I recommend I find nowadays there's more applications of Ja script python is still fantastic don't get me wrong but you might not be able to build as many visually captivating applications or full applications as you can with JavaScript so I usually recommend JavaScript uh what do you think about information Integrity how can we prevent fake news images by AI that's interesting I I've they don't have anything like that in this um presentation but it's tough right like how do you monitor AI generated content I don't know unfortunately I don't know I don't really have a strong opinion opinion on that I don't want to speak out of my expertise here have you ever done any data engineering data science projects a few I mean I I messed around with some like Co tracking projects and whatnot during uh you know during all that guys I like just like building stuff I like building games things you can interact with data modeling is is interesting to interact with but not necessarily to build it's a whole different skill set too right with all the data sence stuff just learn to research and read yourself yeah of course like you have to be you have to always critically think right don't believe what you see which is unfortunate but that's how it is do you know anything to uh to help LM be more reliable and truthful I actually post a video or I'm going to post one soon about something called rag retrieval augmented generation really interesting Tech that can essentially Define the source of where information is coming from so if you get an answer it can actually tell you this is why I came up with the answer this is where I got it from and then you can go back and validate that it's called rag uh stay tuned I'm going to post a video on that there next few weeks so llms that's a huge application essentially it allows you to inject realtime data or to provide the data source that a rag will or rag an llm will reason on website for rag just look it up it's being uh heavily invested in by like Amazon and like other big companies yeah retrieval augmented generation it's kind of a protocol more so than like a library but you can do it with something like Lang chain for example if you guys know what that is python Library JavaScript as well let's see well how much longer we have on the break here we got a few minutes left yeah looks like we got seven more coming up here 540 we should be back here in the next few minutes do you think Russ can replace C++ I don't know about replace maybe I think it will replace in some applications but not all right so much stuff is built in C++ like are you going to rewrite all of it and run rust probably not so you're still going to need C++ but for new applications embedded systems lowle Hardware I think rust is huge I do want to eventually continue that series guys but I don't know It's just tough to find time to film all those now that I'm doing a bunch of other stuff than YouTube what what has your guys' favorite presentation been let me know in the chat which one is most interesting to you I think everyone has a different perspective right which you think even is the most impactful guys hang around we're going to be on the other presentation soon just let me know in the chat what you guys are thinking what you're up to okay looks like we're head back here oh no everyone's drinking their tea no tea for Tim let me know in the chat guys what do you think which one's been the coolest which one would you want to see a demo of there's so many I can't fit them all in the video I'm going to post but I I'll show you some of the cooler ones ladies and gentlemen the final challenge of 2023 Oppo inspiration challenge will resume in 5 minutes time please prepare to take your seats and remember to put your phone on silent mode thank you for your cooperation I guess what we're here have any of you guys been to Singapore either let me know kind of a crazy country for can for Canadian like me the heat has been pretty wild but it's quite cool the the touching was crazy right yeah like touching and then you it transmits the signal so I guess it's like if I have a set of headphones or like they have a speaker and it just goes in between the device I don't know how that works though because how does the device just pick that up and connect to that they might have like a pretty specialized demo but if that just works like out to the Box be unbelievable Desa talking about course careers yeah you guys know I have a new software Dev course I won't talk about that too much in this live stream but you guys can check that out um tech.net deev you guys can see that course desan are you from course careers anyways the touching one which which one was uh which one was that that was the wire r one right yeah wire R 10 million USD 11 to 50 employees 2020 out of the United States got a bunch of phds on their team and they're selling mostly to manufacturers B2B uh AR headset 100 times lower energy they need to increase their production capacity yeah wi R yeah that's the big one was actually going through a module and someone told me to check out YouTube and I saw that you were live so I tapped here oh nice desan yeah sweet nice to see you here bring all your friends get everyone in the chat let me know what time it is for you guys too I know for me right now it's 344 p.m. in Singapore time obviously probably pretty early in the morning for most of you especially if you're from the West do you think Wireless power transer W3 can reach the Market within 10 years I don't know much about Wireless power trans I guess that is that what you're referring to 244 p.m. Dallas wait 244 p.m. do you mean am yeah am right okay yeah you guys are up early well thanks for tuning into the stream being with me here 945 a.m. Poland okay so first thing you do wake up watch Tech with Tim 245 p.m. Vietnam I'm going to Vietnam in a few days hoi men City let me know any recommendations you got why is there no Universal programming language to build everything if there is you can build it in assembly very low level but no one wants to do that and the straw the straw one guys let me find the exact name of that but that was the uh that was the $300 million one that what is that called I guess a biobased solution for flexible Electronics let me find the actual name of that no it's not in this one let me see here that one was yeah that smart resin I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right that's what they're calling it no wait no what I think I'm messing it up guys anyways you got the idea you can look at the proposals in the description I have them in the order spring rolls I'm going to try those thank you very much in fact let me take a photo of that so I remember to try those sweet thank you do you think back and in front engineering is dying out I feel like low code is already replacing it I wouldn't say so low code is like augmenting it helping it but I can tell you like sometimes it's faster just to build it without low code low code is a tool but you still need to know front and a back end to utilize it like the best people to use low code no front and a back end right just like the best people to use Chach BT no development already 846 a Nigeria welcome from Nigeria we actually have someone uh one of the Oppo community members from Nigeria his first time leaving Nigeria and he's here really cool Croatia 945 115 p.m. India okay so it's reasonable time for you guys makes sense a lot of you are not from the US anyone else I see a bunch of you guys in here make sure you like the stream by the way if you haven't done that already please give it a like we got 77 people here pretty early in the morning thank you guys for sticking around got the rest of the presentations I'm still curious which ones do you guys think are the most interesting Flint paper battery I think has some good potential too let's see what else did we look here easy speech like a lot of the app ones are really cool but it's hard to see the value when you don't struggle from the problem right the hearing one was really interesting too that was what impulse yeah nonsurgical hearing aids 347 p.m. Malaysia nice you're close to me man Malaysia that's the same time zone Singapore right on the edge of Malaysia there yeah crazy to be in Asia guys the flight was like 30 hours to get here oh my God definitely worth it though going to hang around uh for a bit longer ladies and gentlemen the final challenge of 20123 Oppo inspiration challenge will resume in 1 minute please your seats right now and remember to put your phone on silent mode thank you for your cooperation any last minute questions anything you guys want to say punch it in now I think we might have another small break I'm not sure Cameroon you guys are all over the place Cameroon that's in Africa wow Kazakhstan 1248 p.m. that's near usbekistan there was someone from usbekistan here are you going to move to Asia for a while you're just visiting I'm going be in Asia for about about 3 4 weeks in total unfortunately I do have a lot of work to do so I can't stay here too long but I would love to live in Asia it just seems like it's warmer it's nicer people are friendly from where I've been everyone speaks English here in Singapore at least it's cheaper maybe not in Singapore but in other places 349 Philippines where are you in Philippines my friend Kenya 1050 a.m. please come to India I just met someone from India who's here as well uh where are you in India India is such a huge country i' be intimidated to go to India love from Cameroon thank you very much tap Bill Germany 949 South Africa man we got people in like every country here hardly seen anyone in the same country this is crazy looks like we're about to dive back in here guys again last minute questions anything you want to say punch in the chat obviously I'll look at it as we go through but I want to focus on these last presentations welcome back ladies and gent I hope all of you are feeling a little bit more refresh right now and ready for the second half of our challenge well ladies and Gentlemen please help me to welcome our ninth team today myx Health technology from China from China all right let's see let's go look at their funding here I do have a Discord guys um discord.gg slwt check that out but I want to pay attention to these proposals here okay mind lacks Health afterno ladies and gentlemen I'm Kate from mlex we are a company using tactile neuro Technologies to improve emotions and the sleep as we all know with the increasing pressure of Life the emotion disorders has been a huge social issue espe people worldwide leave with a mental disorder 10% of them experience insomnia or just think about ourselves have you ever felt you are so tired but you don't know how to rest and relax then introducing our product mlac sleeping mat it is efficient mind relaxation and sleep a too compared with other Solutions it is drug free uh seamless user experience and it is uh very portable here's our demo introducing mind LAX sleeping man a revolutionary solution designed by a team of Sleep Experts and engineers made from a silky smooth material to wrap you in comfort and a powerful app with guided lessons and soothing music to help you build healthy sleep habets mind La sleeping m is the most effective way to sleep better and refreshed every day this secret restful sleep lies in mind lax's own neuroim technology that gives every note of Music a pleasant vibration allowing your body to become a part of the musical resonance this vibro acoustic effect is sensed through your spine and engages your brain that's why the sound you feel is so immersive the effect regulates your autonomic nervous system allowing you to immediately enter a state of deep relaxation and comfort I want one our product has been validated for the product Market Feit already early this year we launched our Kickstarter campaign and Reed more than 1,000 backers with the commitment of 21 days riskfree refund our return rate is just as low low as 1.3% pretty good for % of of our users report it is so effective for them and the similar results showed us in our clinical trials but just put aside these numbers we also receive many valuable comments and feedbacks from our users I remember one of our user called Nal he experienced more than 30 years of insomnia usually he took one two three hours to fall asleep but with us the second day using our product it takes him just 10 minutes it's impressive very grateful to meet us and we are very happy to help them like like natural so this year we will continuously promoting manx as a global brand through our direct to customer sales channels like Amazon online our available our product is already available on the Amazon and you can search Google go for that and we expect we can receive $1.5 million US dollar revenues at the end projected Revenue okay I want only that right now and another memorable feedback from our user is from try and she said your product is just like a electronic Voodoo for me suggesting that our product is so magical is it true to some exent because with no speakers or Webers inside we use our self develop tactile conduction material to generate sound and vibrations wonder if you actually feel that material we have our encoding algorithm to generate the frequencies and then transmit the signals to the brain to have the nerve regulation and on this technology we obtained seven global patterns and 52 software copyrights and we are proud to say in this field of Technology we found no computer competitors in the world for now really we are here today because we do want to collaborate with opal to promote manlike Tech with greater good uh there are two possible synergies the first one is with opal Health uh we could collaborate with them with the monitoring variables and to provide the personal health intervention with our manlike sleeping mat thus to have a close Loop for uh the opal sleep users another cooperation could be in the all smart devices in opal because the core technology of us is the immersive tactile auditory B feedback modules and it can be applied in many scenarios like currently we have the application in smart cars currently we have the proof of concept contract with Ali and Le Auto already in China hence this it's on Kickstarter guys I think I don't know if it's available yet the magic of this experience could be you can not only experience the sense of touch but you can feel the emotions imagine when you watch you are watching a horror movie and you can feel more afraid and excited I don't know if I want that modules inside feel a little bit interesting and just try the so this product and technology is solely created by our interdisciplinary team and Industry experts naming from Neuroscience sleep medicine materials B sensors psychology and public health and we all determined to make better products for all our users so the last but not the least our mlik value we firmly believe selfcare it's not just Health Care not just healing but preventive medicine so we will continuously using our us Centric humanized experience to promote sty for all of our users so last and we wish every of you could sleep smarter and rest in powered thank you so much thank you team good uh I want to go try that one out I guess you just lie I wonder how much you actually feel like is it vibrating you or is it just like doing something in the muscles that helps you relax someone falling as sleep in 10 minutes after like 2 hours pretty impressive your product help a person that uh easily get to sleep in one hour so what's the next step how how to improve your product maybe um lesser time for sleep or any other way yeah uh thank you for your question so we our product usually uh help our uh uh uh users to get to sleep in 10 minutes we actually uh did a lot of uh seat users and testing um before and 90% of them reported the same uh similar effect and also we have done our clinical Trails uh in uh uh Jang University in China and uh we with the clinical tral shows that we de uh the decrease the uh time to fall asleep by 15% of all the trial members and increase uh the time uh the time to maintain deep sleep by 20% of all the of the pallet uh users so that's 15 20% would you guys pay that much for that let me know what you think we also plan to obtain the FDA approval uh uh the would you guys pay that much money for for 15 20% like time to fall as honest our product to sellon we don't really need this uh uh uh medical certificate yeah Fair than never you wouldn't pay that I feel like if you have that forever sleep is pretty important right stimulation for Sleep Disorders um bring the table is also a a haptic solution um your haptic solution I guess Targets this displacement and frequency for the stimulation would you say that that's a core part of your strategic advantage or are there other strategic advantages within your product guys I think Tim is running the judge panel here like you said like the core technology is a heptic we also said it's a tactile uh nerve system because that's a fundamental and the most uh uh uh uh uh the most uh uh uh sensory that transmit most of the information to our brand so we use the tacal but in the meantime we also have the sound um like the auditory sensory uh to uh cooperate with a a tactile sensory to transmit to the signal to the uh uh to the brain and to have the nerve regulation and in the future we will also have other sensories uh because we will have the uh different uh models and like we will have uh like the sense and other sense sensories to increase our Effectiveness thank you thank you be curious what they can get to because propal 15 to 20 or even 25% that's important I guess but that go like an hour to 45 minutes is that a notable difference if it was an hour to 10 minutes which it did for some people that's a big big a bigger difference story but if the average person is getting a small benefit I don't know how impactful that actually is but I mean if you if you think of it right you're sleeping every single night to get an extra 30 minutes of sleep every night or even 1550 minutes of sleep every night that's probably a pretty decent return on investment in terms of your health I guess it does depend on your lifestyle also like if you're travel you going to bring this with you or you going to leave this just your in from us with their they should make like a mattress that'd be sick if they had that that that had the tech right in the mattress music so it has sound as well but what if people use it and never fall asleep without it that's actually a really good point if you become reliant on that and then you need that you don't is the Pioneer of a 3D tracking technology this is so cool I this demo we don't often realize it but from the moment we wake up we're instinctively measuring tracking and adjusting to the 3D environments around us even a simple Act of grabing handle is in truth a highly sophisticated 3D interactions now as we try to make machines and robots work in a similar way the need and the requirements for 3D tracking has evolved as well the problem is the Legacy Solutions cannot keep up they're Limited in customization are complicated to use and are very expensive to dive a little deeper there has been duly in 3D tracking first came Optical using cameras and lasers it's very intuitive but what it cannot see it cannot track so you must have line of sight to overcome this em system was introduced in 1960s no line of sight is needed because magnetic magnetic field can pass through materials but metals can cause Distortion and loss in Precision so for decades this has caused as a time money and even lives in some cases so we decided to create a completely new approach a streamlined system made of just two main components the base station and sensors that is ultra precise that is hasslefree to use our magic is a permanent magnet which allows us to overcome the old limitations with the unique advantages of our own that you won't find anywhere else all combined we're cheaper simpler yet have better performance than anything in the market wow and you don't have to just take my word for it our core patent was granted in just 6 months when a typical us pen takes over two years which shows streng of approach and with the years of know house our technical mode has only grown our primary Market is surgical navigation valued at 8 billion and growing about 14% annually where we partner with the medical device companies across surgical segments let's see one of the examples you can see the base station next to the patient's head creating a tracking Zone and we've attach the sensor one of them to the dro and one to the patient and with just two sensors you have a fully digitized dental implant procedure that's fast reliable and accessible that it's like a simple game that anybody can do and why stop there replace the hand with the robot and you can take full advantage of up to 0.1 mm Precision that we can provide and even automate the process our business model is B2B razor and blade base station is the main Hardware while millions of sensors are sold as peripherals and disposables from simple catheters to surgical robots from neural to dental to Orthopedics the applications are incredibly diverse but medical is difficult so we form strategic partnership first in surgical navigation second in dental implants we launched the pilot program in 2021 and so far accumulated over 1,300 orders worth more than $10 million oh we also had a revelation that's a lot we are a lot of our customers coming up from lowincome Emerging Markets with a rapidly aging populations we're talking billions with no access to timely surgical care millions of preventable deaths and three times the higher mortality rate post surgery compared to high incum naations they desperately need safe affordable And Timely surgical care and that's where we come in our Best in Class 3D tracking enables more targeted therefore safer operations and we do it while saving up to 90% in cost and hours of critical medical time which can save countless lives guys what this does is track really tiny sensors the base station is the product path to grow reach your full potential and thankfully in our current partner Network we can count about 10,000 Hospital hits with up to $150 million of annual recurring Revenue potential wow they give them a huge valuation because we are not providing the end user user Medical Products ourselves we can enter the market even faster they've raised 8.25 million USD exciting is the growing and interconnected I'll show you a a video at some point if possible did the demo it's crazy how accurate is guide the robots and automations make training and simulation and immersive and make everything digital for everyone 3D tracking has a role to play in nearly all Industries and omo is at the center of it this is just like enhanced 3D track just better interesting would be our vision to make digital interactions more human and effortless the precise Dynamic and unambiguous data that we generate are the building blocks of a data driven digital interaction platform for Enterprise workflows and even consumer entertainment oh that would be single device yeah I want that in my uh my years ago when two immigrants met in San Francisco and since then we have created a fullstack team that is uniquely capable of perfecting this technology with the years or Decades of experience in their respective fields from Material Science can you guys imagine inventing this and building this like the Geniuses that do that that's wild thanks to all the progresses that we made we recently raised a pre AR round LED by the two strategic Partners who are obviously 3D tracking our goal is to fulfill existing demand achieve mass production Readiness and expand to other verticals I mentioned at the beginning the simple Act of grabbing a handle with you and opa's help we can open the door of the digital transformation at a global scale for everyone everywhere and truly be an inspiration for people thank you good presentation well you guys said you don't quite understand it for QA I think it's cuz I've seen the demo I understand it better they I wish they would just do the demo on stage it'd be a lot more impactful than the whole slide deck but I guess they need to do the whole keynote thing let's see what they ask them here where's Tim with the questional angle with OP product uh so I showed three different slides I think it ended with a single device you know mobile device that you can use to interact in digital environment if you will I think that's the end goal if you will um but as you've seen from the chart that expanded outwards there are multiple intermediate steps that we can take to get there robotics automation manufacturing training simulation all these are areas where having a really precise tracking in in 3D can really benefit in ways that you might you might not even know right now so I would like to explore those potential but ultimately I want to get to the end goal yeah let's see Tim with question what is the cost ofation versus EMF that's the incumbent industry you EMF yeah yeah uh so the market Standard right now is a company called ndi from Canada and their unit purchased in between 20 to $30,000 wow anywhere in the world basically uh but it's very it takes a very long time to actually receive it because their capacity is pretty limited our device we originally started the company wanting to enter into consumer VR we didn't see the potential uh so it's cheap let's see how much it cost Medical in between um so we originally wanted theice to be extremely affordable which means like ,00 oh right now we can actually manufacture at 300 or less so sell 700 many times more than that we still have a lot of room to play with I say wow so guys this is like a little pod thing like you could buy this cuz they said they want to use for VR some of the big concerns in manufacturing are repeatability reproducibility and in the product you have concerns like Edge case failures um these can have big impacts on lives are these areas that you think you can stand out uh from your competitors are these areas where you've had enough production that you can kind of understand uh how you're going to match up to some of the requirements actually that's one of the areas that we love getting questions from so one of the is question we had a lot but one of them is that we never need calibration on site wow so once we calibrate our uh device during the production the users never have to calibrate the device because compability is basically always going to be there so absolute positioning in relations to the base station plus the center uh you don't have to worry about theability yeah damn and yeah Tech with Toby yeah I I was asked to host live stream uh so uh in relative to the total cost of uh Medical instru uh what kind of uh uh percentage or Revenue po potential you looking at uh for this uh Market yeah so the device itself I mentioned that we had a lot of room to play with uh the consumables disposable actually the margins are pretty thin so it's more about the numbers game if you will uh so I think in terms of the margin I can't reveal the exact numbers but you can expect anywhere between 20 to even 50% um but there do does exist highend disposable is even so these are maybe you can use it 10 times and then throw it away um those are more expensive and it have a higher margin built in um the interesting thing always with the medical is that there are so many different use cases and variations that you can pursue uh that you basically won't run out of ideas wow yeah just saying you can do really really high Precision 3D tracking of like many types of sensors you can their demo was so cool they had like a little like uh and you just stick it around this like head they kind of showed it there but they had like a real world demo and in real time it was like I mean it's as precise as you could possibly imagine moving in and out and showing you like inside objects cool Unfortunately they are unable to join us today due to an emergency so up next yeah we're skipping one of the presentations our 12 team Sky light from China with their proposal Define the Next Generation displays with perov skite microad nextg displays okay I haven't I haven't seen too much about this they ra three male started in 2023 they're from China right good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I Jing I'm a material scientist from University of Cambridge I'm also the funer and CEO of Skylight today I'm presenting to you guys the Next Generation display using provos Sky micro ever since 30 years ago when liquid Crystal LCD was first adopted uh until 20 years ago old that OED was launched we have never stopped pursuing a brighter a clearer and more color Vivid sort of display and immersive experience but what comes with it is extremely high and increasingly high power consumption that POS a really really high and negative impact on the battery life for the customer but also to our planet so our solution is provos Skai micro solution which is T times more energy efficient than the current LCD and twice as much energy efficient as a olad the key enabler is this material called provos much much Superior performance than the current Quantum doc technology which some of you might recognize has just won the 2023 chemistry Nobel priz the key limitation factor of this material I mean the performance is fantastic but the the problem with this material is extremely unstable it quickly degradates under ambient condition when exposed to water and moist uh moisture and oxygen so we are the research team based in Cambridge cin dig laboratory we spend years of research to come up with a micop porus optical glass to stabilize this material and I'm really really proud to announce at this uh opal inspiration challenge that we are able to stabilize this magic material for more than 10,000 hours under ambient conditions what that means is how long is 10,000 hour material in your mobile devices your arvr headsets imposing a very very we call it water oxyer sort of uh anti 46 days layers of continuous us this really opens up this um opportunity for this material to be used in especially in in display uh industry by adopting very similar principle of the in printer or the printer we use in everyone's household we're able to make production of this material extremely scalable we making the Precision of sub pixel down to 0.8 Micron so to to give you a perspective active um the late you know uh it is 50 times more pixel dense than the written of display we're using our opal phone or other other pads really so we're targeting essentially uh the very big um we call call Commercial display market and also TV market for its Energy Efficiency and we're targeting the micro display for AR and vrs because it's very very bright color yeah it needs to be super precise so small not only are we able to produce a very very strong performance in terms terms of red light blue light and green light combining with in printing technology we're able to make this uh production of this uh display manufacturing really scalable comparing directly with our close competitor we're able to generate more than six times much bright uh brighter this uh red light than our close competitor will have a much much reduced uh prod uh production cost because in printing machine is much cheaper than lithography and also the consumable compos theography so our team combines the experience not um not only combines experience of top talents from un a ghost person with um industry expert we have our CTO fulltime CTO coming from Apple who has been studying and also researching on their latest Pro and we have uh a great combination of material research stup operation and also product designs and also by combining with uh the very vibrant camper ecosystem which is a global headquarter for arm we have the cofounder and Co of arm joining as a strategic advisor but also um a collections of essentially semiconductor manufact fabulous manufacturing Manufacturing Company funders joining us as visors you got a pretty good team there so essentially we have been tested our material and we successfully proved the the the the performance on the commercial display and also the TV display and we have brought our demo with us uh for the micro micro I got to go check that out I didn't look at VR please come and join us uh the T breaks later so as eight months old company we're quickly transitioning um from Pilot stage to the uh from the demo stage to the pilot St by working with indust uh industry leaders in manufacturing and Productions so we're codeveloping the technology with kativa the global leader in in printing um um uh in INR printing equipment for OED manufacturing and we have just won the global championship for new display technology challenge organized by Boe the largest display panel manufacturer in China and this pretty legit for 8 months it's impressive um not only are we do we want to work with ra million we also working with Magna for much more efficient lighting solution for automobile but also working with Intel to develop a low power consumption chip for uh display solutions by Skylight so we're redefining the uh display technology for mobile phones arvr headsets and also flat panel and also outdoor um display Solutions so like the thing behind him in reshaping the future of visual and action and Computing thank you thank you so much you now have three minutes and 35 seconds for Q&A and he's on time too unlike everyone else let's see Tim before presentation a quick question regarding the uh production so uh how are you at what stage is your technology in terms of the mass production and how do you solve the mass transfer problem for the larger screen uh great question I'll break break that into two folds uh we have just uh established our Global headquarters in sujo industrial park and has we are planning to build our manufacturing capacity from now to 20 times more in the next 6 months so we have essentially look up the equipment and also manufacturing facilities in suo industrial park um for Mass transfer techniques so essentially our business model in big TVs and also commercial display is Will Will license all material and also essentially manufacturers and theys have the mass transfer techniques for big display but for small and micro display you don't need the mass transfer techniques so we can make the chips at and modules ourself okay thank you yeah thank you no questions would you say your uh biggest Advantage is the uh material that stabilizes the property of uh uh peros guide yes so we first and we're the first research group in the world to come up with Optical glass and we are also the first group to essentially synthesize and upscale the Productions of this Optical glass so special we first essentially observed this phenomena this fantastic phenomena and because of my background and my cofounders background chemical engineer we we immediately started essentially using a much more chemical engineering processing techniques to essentially upscale the production of this uh material and we the exact reason we're choosing inter printing rather than lithography or other very expensive processing techniques is we have identify because in printer and also in printing technique has been widely commercially available so we're using essentially we D risk our adoption our material um uh in industrialization by adopting more mature technology this guy's killing it this is a great presentation he knows all the answers I don't even have anything to say just listen to this guy talk problems right now that are seeking this solution um in terms of the brightness or other aspects where uh bringing in such a new technology that's still evolving is really worth the risk in order to solve those needs Tim killing it with questions as always so one of the key advantage of this Prova microad is it can generate more than 1 million nits in brightness so that's about 1,000 times LCD on ol I was going to sayal through AR microed is a must have solution to combine with um Essen wave um but for a commercial display 1,000 times brightness cost is the very crucial factors um we can actually essentially because it's is much more energy efficient we can reduce his brightness by use much less power so essentially the um at the top manufacturer especially in China uh is working with us in developing the this material technology uh in their commercial display wow I think this guy's a contender here for thank you so much Sky life the because very very good presentation please score their proposal times Light My Town yeah probably you might need like special sunglasses to look at it I think it's just a demonstration of the capability for media choice I think we have two left guys I really liked that one that's one of my favorite ones so far uh that's come up I just thought it was a very clear presentation as well which I can't say for all of them some of them were a little bit all over the place all right coming right up like a Clear Vision too on what they want to do from Estonia Estonia interesting okay any possibility for caption unfortunately guys it can't live caption afterwards YouTube should autoc caption this for you um but I I don't think you can do like live stream captions my name is hanisa and I'm the CEO at Wula so our journey at Wula started in 2020 when I used to have my own online store and that's where I saw the plastic packaging problem so 159 billion Parcels were shipped last year and 40% of them in plastic bubble wrap so after seeing this problem I started looking for new materials myself that could replace plastic bubble wrap cuz at the time I needed them in my own online store and it was a very difficult task there were basically no materials out there that would be sustainable and also look good until we found out about sheep wool so we found out that 200,000 tons of sheep wool goes to waste in Europe every year and this is because the quality of of it is very low so you can't textile production you can't do anything from it so farmers were like literally burning or burying the wool and I thought that that's such a shame cuz it's like a natural Miracle material it's elastic it regulates temperatures and humidity and I mean the sheer amount of it 200,000 tons that goes to waste this could actually replace all plastic bubble wrap globally and that's exactly what we started doing at wam so we are replacing plastic bubble wrap with wool packaging and this is the first product that we launched it's the wool envelope so it has a recycled paper layer on the outside for printing the message on it and for attaching a label and then it has a wool layer on the inside so the wool layer uh protects Parcels in Transportation uh and the packaging also stands out so these two things combined really helps to keep plastic out of the picture for good our clients are online stores who are shipping fragile Goods so companies who are making Electronics Beauty and skincare products jewelry Watches luxury products perfume supplements Etc and our main markets right now are France and Scandinavia so here's a quick overview of some of our clients wonder if it's laun um the product into the market in 2020 so the same year that we uh got the idea so we're already quite active in the market um we have early traction so a monthly revenue of 35,000 is what we do right now it's not bad considering examples of how2 Millies are currently being used so here's an example of an online store who is uh using vula to ship out their Electronics so phones um headphones watch must like that and here's the newest prototype that we have so this is a watch box we made specifically for Oppo you can also see this in the demo area so oppon needed a um wool component in their watch packaging to protected during Transportation so we made this early prototype this is super soft by the way guys this material feels really cool and uh in terms of the other industry so this is a very cool example of the Dutch perfumery that's called Sal PR who is using Wula to ship um their perfumes and they actually also use it as retail packaging and here's a French company called mmas boo who is shipping cosmetics in woa as a standard packaging see that makes more sense to me elect example from a comp usinga to ship out like supplements and vitamins and we are also working with the luxury sector so we are working with the lbmh group uh that houses Brands like Louis vuon and Dior and many others and we are the winner of The lbmh Innovation award in sustainability which we just got uh this year in June in terms of uh our production so we are based in Estonia and so is our production so we have our own everything we produce is in house and the factory is also based in Estonia and in terms of like uh energy we have our own uh autonomous renewable energy grids that we partially use for powering the factory and in terms of certificates so we are very proud to be a certified BC Corp as of this year and our products are also uh FSC certified and we're in the final stages of getting the TV certification I don't know what a b cor is we are an externally fun company so we are backed by Future Ventures which is a Silicon Valley based VC fund that has invested €3 million EUR in tuula 3 million EUR okay very importantly the people behind all of this so our team we're quite a small team of 15 uh people um but we have uh a 50% uh ratio uh of all managerial roles being filled by women at wola and when we were looking for a location for our Factory we chose um a region that is very rural and it has a high rate of chronical chronically underemployed people so 30% of our population comes from that segment and impr all of our employes have stock options at Wula because this is the only way that we think it makes sense to work towards this very big mission I don't know if that's good from an investor perspective the last thing I want to talk about is what to do with Wula packaging after the end user receives it so there's three options uh reuse it return it or compost it and the ReUse part probably needs the most explanation uh and it's also the most fun thing to explain uh in my opinion so these are all ideas what you can do with woa packaging after you receive it C I totally do that actually got most of these ideas from our end users they just started posting about it on social media and tag us this is so for example you can use the wool packaging as a dish mop that you can see in the first photo um for some reason cats and dogs really like sleeping uh on the W parts so people use it as a pet bed you can use it for DIY projects you can um make shoe insoles from it because this is really sick like legitimately reusable humity so for Nordic climates it works very well you can also use it as a plant fertilizer and there are a lot of um opportunities a pencil case that's interesting so I briefly already mentioned the um packaging prototype that we made for Oppo so this was a good test for us to see if we can help opo replace plastic and I think the Prototype showed that we can so we're very excited to see if there are more opportunities for us to work together thank you very much another good presentation clear have 2 minutes and 35 seconds for Q&A Judes right on time too wow well done uh I have a question regarding how you plan to uh scale up the business you mentioned there 200,000 uh tons of uh wasted War annually in Europe alone so uh with your factory in Estonia and uh uh what's your plan on utilizing all these ws and uh shipping the uh packaging product to all over the world yeah I feel like is not the best location for that factory has quite a high production capacity we can make up to 800,000 packages a month so in terms of Revenue we're talking about like roughly 400,000 so the production capacity is quite High to you know Serv as a big portion of Europe but we are um very much looking into expanding to Asia as well and if we do that then we are going to um duplicate our production line and the let's say good thing about it is that we are uh let's say a very um like our production technology is very affordable to duplicate and in terms of timeline it can be done within 6 months so that's one of like our core advantages that has basically brought us here well I feel like the scalability is a bit of an issue for me to see here follow up on that question in terms of your wasteful sourcing um are there any concerns about the stability of your sources in terms of competitors uh maybe not even competing in this area but competitors wanting to access that waste wol or any limitations and scaling from the amount of total Global waste wol yeah so the amount of waste wo is so big that it's quite hard to grasp you know what this 200 ,000 tons mean but I mentioned before that our U Max production capacity right now is 800,000 packages and if we were to work at Max Capacity right now the amount of wool that we would need yearly is around 1% of the 200,000 tons so this is how much waste wool there actually is so yeah running out of material basically is not like a risk we we're seeing right now I have I think she's not really thinking of like a huge huge perspective envelope yeah so our replacement product is mainly the plastic bubble wrap envelope because we're focused on like the protective aspect of it and we are more expensive of course but we are quite competitive so we have different sizes and the products product Prices range between 60 cents to1 Euro and we mainly work on quantity so we're focused on you know larger larger deals and we also offer like quantity discounts but those are the retail prices okay thank you so much woa for your wonderful that was a really good presentation as well guys I I fear that she's like thinking on a smaller level cuz I'm hearing numbers like 35k 400k like these kind of guys that are judging here I think have a billion dollar potential right can this company grow to a billion doll company maybe it's cool but out of Estonia probably not right 400k per month Max Revenue out of one facility it sounds like a lot but it's not really that much so that's still it's a good price range but I'm just C curious like can they actually expand and scale to that point last two proposals Unfortunately they cannot join us in person in Singapore but they will join us online let welcome our next team I like from Israel and the proposal 3D interactive platform okay this is the one I mixed up earlier this is going to be on Zoom guys everyone we are grateful to the organizer for allowing us to participate remotely thank you very much for your understanding and now I will ask you to close your eyes for a few seconds and listen you can open your eyes now if I will ask you what it was all about you would probably tells me that it was taken from a movie scene but guys it's actually 15 seconds that we recorded in a random street in t Aviv can you imagine yourself navigating this situation without see anything we are already in 2023 and the technological advancements are on its way and yet these are the most common solution for partially sided and blind people with today achievements we are able and committed to give them much more based on this fact iight was founded so highlight is developing a smartphone size surface that can model complex object create Real Time 3D maps and even replicate facial features with this tech technology user can actually touch feel and understand their environment everywhere they are in the initial phase the surface interface with smartphone s case on its back but in the future it will be embedded inside the motivation behind the product is the familiar Gadget the pinard surface highlight has invented a novel moded for metrix control of high resolution surface we know how to simultaneously operate thousands of linear pixels using only one engine in real time and with minimal power consumption whoa okay here you can see our demo using computer vision and AI algorithms we have six steps of analyzing we started with real time streaming that is captured by a stereo camera after that we convert the input to a depth map then to point Cloud rotating the point of view to top view and eventually demonstrated the whole of this process into a live pin art simulator this simulator represent the topographic map of the room and the person that navigates inside so they can feel on their hands of 16 pixel just to prove our concept and technology in the video on the left the physical Matrix gets the input using a 3D camera that identifies the location of the cube and demonstrates it's on the smart surface in the video in the middle the physical metrix get wireless input from a remote application the user changes the location and the height of the green Cube and as you can see the SM the SM surface changes accordingly in the video on the right we have connected the previous live streaming from the room but this time to a real hour surface it illustrates the great refresh rate that can be reached using our technology and the potential of our backr product today we are in the initial production phase of the first product that already contains thousands of pixels mean she is one of the participants in our experiments that highlight conducts periodically with potential end users she's totally blind from birth here she's navate using our product so she's holding a pin map room to reach the white chair located on the right side of the room this room she has never navigated before as you can see the amazing results even surprised us so guys she's holding essentially 3D mapping of the room that's using a pin out map million people are estimated to be partially on blinds and this number is growing exponentially every 5 Seconds someone in the words goes blind our business model is based on product sale alongside a Subs model premium services and special features in a highly competitive market highlight stands out with very clear advantages including a user user friendly interface the ability to operate at any moment moment and environment and of course personal customization so we started our journey about three years ago received a nondilutive governmental Grant secured preed by Israel Innovation Authority and incubate Ventures now we are transitioning from development to production and one year from now we aim to launch our first product in the market as an ambitious team which has reached technological skills and of course clear message we want to good question the chat guys see if they ask that or not Imp in the world our technology has longterm potential in various aspects just think how much the digital world today lacks the sense of touch the experience doesn't feel authentic and the existing human machine interfaces lack sensibilities just to give you a teaser imagine our product assisting to a doctor or surgeon in real time to obtain tangible information that aids in their decision Mak process the wild can help as a remote control and remote steering platform our system will be able to both model in 3D and identify user input in real time and how the gaming experience looks when the user can feel what they see totally mindblowing currently we are in the seed funding ground and we are welcome any connection to VCS and private investors additionally we are seeking for Business Partnership and Joint PC's thank you very much thank you you now have two minutes and 52 seconds for Q&A I wonder if they're live on Zoom resp good question though I don't know how detailed this is and if they can do small objects and moving objects seems like it's designed for stationary terrain if you test it your product in an outdoor evolving environment yeah there you go hi everyone and fortunately we cannot be in in person in Singapore but this is a good good question currently all the testing were in indoor environment because of the transformation but accordingly to the R&D plan we are talk talking about doing the outdoor testing in the near future okay that would have been I wish they had done that CU I would have said a lot probably about the product good questions in the chat you um that you were using a cane and the device at the same time so the idea of the device is not to replace a cane for the smaller motor functions to prevent tripping but rather to provide kind of a larger infrastructure for navigation exactly this is what highlights does honestly we are a compliment complimentary product the the aim is not to replace an assist another assistive guide but also to give another demonstration of the environment in order them more a 3D map you can tou um ability to understand what is going on in the surrounding in the first phase we are aimed to to be as a complimentary product but in the long run it's supposed to cover the the dog and the dog training or the assistive a I'm not really sure what she just said there so a person with uh blind disability does he or she uh require special training in order to understand what the device is uh sending out as uh information uh as a followup question uh so with this uh how do you compare it uh with uh for example audio edit uh navigation so this question at the first point um iight is looking um not only to to be separated product but also to be as a platform that the camera as you can see in this in the video and a complimentary um audio feedback about what is going on the surrounding and the collaboration between the S the sound and the S the touch supposed to cover the visual Gap um so this is our how the platform does and about your um second thought the second uh question about competitors what is the added value of highight is the the volume if we are looking the competitors most of them are doing manipul manipulation in order to um stimulate and gesture but the learning process of highlight is very very simple and clear just imagine that as cided person unid P blind needs to touch thing in in the physical places in order to you identify what the objects are it's the same but in a small size so the the learning process as we did in the PC um experience just clear the the the message that the product is very intuitive for the user and also um very short learned H learning process thank you so much are pretty early to be honest with you 3D interactive platform Med friends please vote VI media Choice link thank we have one more I think we have one more I'm not sure that was I think they said that was the second last one I think there's one more take a moment to consolidate the current scores before the final team takes the stage I wonder who do you guys think is going to win at this point this is yeah this is interesting I really don't know there's so many present they're so different ladies and gentlemen welcome our final LED guy smart res from is and their proposal biased solution for flexible Electronics oh I messed that up there was I don't know what the other one was that was like that really cool like orb thing that was uh the reusable materials well they have a lot of reusable ones I don't know let's see smart resin okay my name is Leon and I'm the CEO of smart residing I would like to thank you for the opportunity to present smart resident raliz solution for flexible Electronics flexible display are the future of technology and it's going to change the entire way we use our devices and the entire user experience the most common material in news today is poly meat there are other polymers mostly fossil derived that continue to contribute to the growth in ew they are also lack of performance and expensive to produce therefore we must find a biobased solution cellulose is a great fit due to to its chemical structure is of handling and biodegradability cellulose is the most abandoned biopolymer on Earth it's basically a sugar that can generate transparent film as you can see on the upper side of the slide however the resulted film is brittle smart resident combines the most elastic material in nature resident protein with cellulose to give flexible yet strong film as you can see on the down side of the slide so what is resing imagine you could jump to the top of Statue of Liberty in a single jump it turns out that fleas has the equivalent ability they can jump about 100 times their height in order to get to the top of a dog or a cat and they can do it due to this amazing protein named residing so we decided to bring residing as a biobased natural solution to pollutant and harmful materials we can then provide alternative super performing materials for sustainable application oh how do we do it we don't kill insect to take out residing rather we use genetic engineering technique to take the DNA that code for residing we can tailor fitted to bind to cellulose or any other biopolymer in the future we then introduce it into bacterial cells that can produce a lot of this protein in a fermentation process we are a spinoff of the Hebrew University and have an exclusive licensing agreement with them in order to bring residing as an available solution to the industry we have established a joint venture with a 17 years of experience biotechnological company asss bio we already established the first Milestone the fermentation yield and are now working on the second target which is the production cost in order to achieve that we have set up a few Milestones by 2024 the first one was already established the optimal media which is basically the food that we give to the bacteria in order for them to grow we need to scale up from a few hundred liters to 10,000 liter inhouse and hundred of thousands in the future we continue to develop analytical and downstream processing we put emphasis on eoe efficiency and optimal use of resources that will eventually enable us to optimize for large scale production this is actually the 10,000 lit tank fermentation that is in use in asss facilities today resident can then be mixed with nanocellular to generate a film that is flexible transparent and strong we can control the thickness the there are Green Solution using biodegradable materials they are lightweighted scratch resistant have good performance in blocking UV and they expected to be lower at cost in comparison to poly in large scale so there you go guys this is what is replacing qualities mechanical Optical thermal and electrical are a great Feit for this industry just imagine a dragon fly that fla the wing millions of times with no fatigue due to the resling it integrated into your smartphone that you can fold again and again oh H we currently produce our film in lab scale using a roller coaster a roller coaster as you can see in this video and then let it dry but in large scale we have available roll to roll facilities that is a wellknown continuous fabrication process for flexible substrate for example Cod of film is produced just like that residing has other use cases that for example residing film that is just residing they are very elastic films and can be used for example for cosmetic Solutions another example is resing hydrogel that are crosslink resling that can be integrated into sports goods we can use it as a 3D ink since resing is a photopolymerized biopolymer and as a composite with nanocellulose as a first solution for flexible electron they want flexible electronics that makes biology and material science my background is biotechnology I did my PhD at Professor o lab who is by himself an entrepreneur who started more than this a bit complicated to follow but I think I'm kind of getting and Daniel brings best expertise in Material Science biotechnology and Business Development our board of directors bring vast expertise in financials and Business Development Al together we bring this to life yeah that makes more sense impact we are looking to reduce the use of toxic chemicals save energy in the production process replace synthetic nonbiodegradable materials and lower the overall CO2 emission to summarize we expect high sell potential within two years companies in the biofabrication field are already evaluated as unicorns we could just be the next one it's a rapidly growing field we established a joint venture to be the first to commercialize rling we collaborate with leading Global Brands and already generated over half a million in incomes we enter the ESG impact with our ecological process and products we have a solid technology and a strong team to do all of that I would like to thank you and call you to join us in bringing residing to the mass market so guys this is the last presentation sorry to speak overas material we're going to do the Q&A and then unfortunately I'm not actually allowed to Le to you who win this you have to go to check QA Jud gonna do a Q&A here let me know in the chat right now who you guys think is going to win I think LED the LED presentation is is one of the top ones for sure I think the big 300 million us one has potential as well even though they don't really need like the exposure that they have here I really like the haptic one I don't think that's going to win though the 3D modeling one looks good if we look at something like P it's primarily for the price manufacturing but when we look at something like polyamid uh it's not so much about the price but the durability and harsh environments including space um so I guess uh to start with you're really targeting the flexible Electronics specifically um could you mention maybe what specific uh advantages you have besides the source of the material in that space Also performance wise uh I mean for example polyamid is very easily creased whereas our solution is not that easily creased we have better results for example using um a pensile test so to see how it g uh it's it's stronger when we tested T side stress guys let me know who you think wise we are better uh however we do have disadvantage in terms of stability for temperature but still uh our qualities are good for this Market we are stable up to 280 degrees which is very good for uh you know for biobased materials and it's good enough for this market so even though poly is stable up to 300 and more we are still good for this application guys again we're going to end right after this Q&A so if it's abrupt I apologize about that uh sorry I'll jump in again yeah in terms of the total available U fermentation facilities globally um do you think that you can meet the scaling that would be needed to really jump into a consumer device product definitely ACS bio already have a partner in in China that have the capacity of 250,000 liters and there are available up to half a million in Europe in the US so and and they're just standing available for any manufacturing that wants to come so once we establish a large scale fermentation process that is durable we can do it anywhere in the world which is also uh contribute to the you know to the sustainability because we can produce anywhere uh lowering the transportation issues thank you nice all right guys that was was the last presentation LED guy 3D tracking personally I like the haptic one but it's not going to win I don't think um Wula was pretty good but I don't think they really have that longm wrest for your wonderful proposal and judges please score our final proposal biobased solution for flexible Electronics Med a friends please also vote via the media Choice link thank you okay guys so they are going to be doing the judging if you want to see who wins you do have to go to the official opo website unfortunately I'm not allowed to share that with you as much as I would like to uh again we've kind of done our predictions here in the chat thank you guys all for tuning into this I know this is a different thing than I normally do on the channel but I had a really really fun time massive thank you to Oppo for bringing me out here to Singapore ladies and gentlemen we have completed all 15 those pitch sessions please another big round of applause to thank all the wonderful teams for their lovely proposals and presentations thank you so much teams and of course a huge thank you to all our wonderful judges as well all of you have really wrecked your brains hard yeah seriously proposal sitting here for three hours we will tabulate the scores right now and announce the top five proposals in a short while time so voting channel for the media Choice Award will close in 5 minutes time so media friends do take this time to cast your votes we will now be going for a short break please do visit our products Eno your refh go it'll be announced on there short at 520 p.m 520 p.m. we will announce and present the awards for the top five outstanding proposals media choice and People's Choice Awards for today's event thank you all so much and I will see all of you later perfect I have a short tea break here guys so I'll stay on for one minute and then I'm going to hop off again thank you guys so much for tuning in this I like I said it's Unique I see all you guys in the chat it was super fun to talk with you uh and if you guys want more live streams in the future please do let me know it's probably not going to be a big event like this but uh just in terms of Q&A talking seeing some cool stuff if anything this definitely inspired me it gave me really some cool ideas for like what you could do with tech and these startups these startups have like 50k in funding and look what they're able to do really really impressive and like all of these are practically brand new one of them was 2016 but most of them are like 2020 2021 2023 really really cool all right guys going to hop off the stream here thank you guys so much I will see you in some more YouTube videos comments Etc make sure you like the stream share it it will be available shortly after this in DVR on the Channel with that said take it easy guys
