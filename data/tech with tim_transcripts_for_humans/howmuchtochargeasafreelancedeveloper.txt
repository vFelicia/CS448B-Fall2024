00:00 - most freelance developers have no idea
00:02 - how much they should be charging and
00:04 - they miss out on thousands upon
00:06 - thousands of dollars by simply charging
00:08 - too little in this video I'm going to
00:10 - share with you exactly how much you
00:12 - should charge as a freelance developer
00:14 - I'm going to explain how you can justify
00:16 - that price and how you can adjust that
00:18 - depending on the client that you're
00:19 - working for now my name is Tim I've been
00:21 - a software developer for over five years
00:23 - I've done full-time work freelance work
00:25 - I've paid freelance developers and I've
00:28 - gone from making about twenty dollars
00:29 - per hour to over 400 US dollars per hour
00:32 - when I do freelance and Consulting work
00:34 - I know that sounds insane but I promise
00:37 - you after you watch this video you'll
00:38 - understand why and how and how you can
00:40 - get to that same level so with that said
00:42 - let's get into the video after a quick
00:44 - word from our sponsor if you're like me
00:46 - then you look at your screen for 8 to 10
00:48 - hours every single day making your
00:51 - monitor one of your most used items
00:53 - fortunately a few years ago I discovered
00:55 - Ben q and they've been my go-to monitor
00:58 - brand since so much so that I teamed up
01:00 - with them and they've sponsored this
01:02 - video and are actually the official
01:03 - monitor brand of tech with Tim right now
01:05 - BenQ actually offers some really
01:07 - affordable monitors that are
01:09 - specifically designed for programmers
01:10 - under their GW line these monitors
01:13 - actually offer a coding mode which
01:14 - optimizes the contrast and saturation
01:17 - specifically for dark mode iCare
01:19 - technology USBC connection and a great
01:22 - quality display without breaking the
01:24 - bank these monitors come in 24 and 27
01:26 - inch and are perfect for anyone looking
01:28 - to upgrade from a single laptop screen
01:29 - or a low quality display personally I
01:32 - use two 27-inch
01:34 - gw2785 TCS for my secondary setup where
01:38 - I work off of my Mac laptop with one of
01:40 - them positioned vertically they've got
01:41 - speakers a microphone and best of all
01:44 - they offer BenQ Eye Care technology
01:46 - which automatically adjusts the
01:47 - brightness of the screen to make it
01:49 - easier on your eyes check them out from
01:51 - the link in the description and enhance
01:52 - your coding and efficiency today the
01:55 - first thing you need to understand as a
01:57 - freelance developer is that you are a
01:59 - business you may be the only developer
02:01 - in that business but you are a business
02:03 - that means that you need to maximize
02:05 - profits just like every other business
02:07 - that exists on planet Earth put aside
02:09 - the emotions you're not the nice guy
02:11 - helping out a friend you're not doing
02:13 - this as charitable work you're not doing
02:15 - it for fun or a side project you are
02:17 - making money keep that frame in that
02:20 - context whenever you get into any type
02:21 - of negotiation and you'll see
02:23 - immediately that you're going to be
02:24 - treated with a bit more respect and that
02:25 - you're gonna be able to demand higher
02:27 - rates now why is that the case well a
02:29 - lot of software developers are very
02:31 - nonchalant they're very relaxed they're
02:33 - developers after all right they want to
02:35 - sit in the basement they want to write
02:36 - code and they want to do the engineering
02:38 - work and that is definitely me but at
02:40 - the same time you need to put on that
02:42 - CEO kind of business hat act as a
02:44 - professional and go into a meeting with
02:46 - the idea that you're here to negotiate
02:48 - and you're here to figure out what the
02:49 - optimal exchange of value is between you
02:52 - and the business what you are doing as a
02:54 - freelance developer is you are providing
02:56 - value to a company or to an individual a
02:59 - client whatever it may be in return
03:01 - you're going to be compensated for that
03:02 - value so you need to understand how much
03:05 - value are you able to provide and then
03:07 - what percentage of that value are you
03:09 - going to take back as your compensation
03:11 - so let's give an example here when I was
03:13 - much younger 18 19 years old I would
03:16 - actually do homework assignments for
03:18 - friends or on sites like Fiverr so
03:20 - people would kind of come to me and say
03:21 - hey I have this python assignment I you
03:24 - know waited two days until it's due I'm
03:26 - not gonna be able to finish it can you
03:27 - finish it for me in that context I was
03:29 - only able to provide minimum value the
03:31 - reason for that is I'm working for a
03:33 - student this isn't something that's
03:34 - going to make them any kind of money all
03:36 - I'm doing is saving their grade and I'm
03:38 - saving them the time of completing the
03:40 - assignment so in that case charging 30
03:42 - per hour or charging 100 or 200 for the
03:45 - project is a reasonable exchange of
03:47 - value because I'm saving them a bit of
03:49 - time and I'm saving them you know their
03:51 - grade or portion of their grade now
03:53 - let's switch the example up and imagine
03:54 - that we're working for a company that
03:56 - makes one million dollars per month in
03:57 - Revenue they sell some product or
03:59 - service they they have a checkout page
04:01 - that checkout page is poorly optimized
04:03 - you can go in there and optimize it fix
04:04 - some technical bugs and maybe that leads
04:06 - to five percent more people actually
04:08 - making it through the checkout process
04:10 - if that's the case you did probably the
04:12 - same amount of work that you might have
04:13 - done for another client but you were
04:14 - able to provide fifty thousand dollars
04:17 - worth of value in the first month right
04:18 - it's six hundred thousand dollars worth
04:20 - of value over the entire year in that
04:22 - context is it reasonable for you to
04:24 - charge twenty thousand dollars through
04:26 - that fix or twenty five thousand dollars
04:28 - sure it is you are only clawing back
04:30 - fifty percent of the value that you
04:32 - provided to the company from their
04:33 - perspective it's a no-brainer look at
04:35 - the ROI they just got a 200 Roi on their
04:38 - cost and a lot of times I'm gonna pay
04:39 - you until it's finished think of things
04:41 - like bug bounties why do they pay so
04:43 - much for that because the amount of
04:45 - money they get back from the work that
04:46 - you are doing is absurd so it's much
04:48 - more about the client that you're
04:50 - working for and the amount of value you
04:52 - can inject and provide then is what
04:54 - exactly you're doing or the technical
04:56 - skill that you have so always keep that
04:58 - in mind and go into your negotiation
05:00 - locations and meetings with the idea
05:02 - that you are going to figure out where
05:04 - you can provide the most amount of value
05:05 - you're going to ask the correct
05:07 - questions you're going to understand the
05:08 - type of business that you're working for
05:09 - and you're going to put that business
05:11 - and kind of CEO hat on and start the
05:13 - negotiation from a value proposition
05:15 - perspective all right so now let's dive
05:17 - into hourly versus per project pricing
05:19 - now in the majority of situations you're
05:21 - going to make more money if you charge
05:22 - per project and it's going to be a lot
05:24 - easier to charge a much higher rate
05:27 - because you're not breaking it down per
05:28 - hour typically you don't want to charge
05:30 - for your time you want to charge for
05:32 - your experience and the value you're
05:34 - able to provide however this is only the
05:37 - case if you have a very very
05:38 - well-defined project where the
05:40 - requirements are scoped out you know
05:42 - exactly what it is that you need to do
05:44 - and you draw up a great legal contract
05:47 - that defines exactly what you need to
05:49 - provide to be given that amount of money
05:51 - it also is important that you're taking
05:53 - a portion of that money up front and
05:55 - then you have some type of payment plan
05:56 - so you don't need to wait until the
05:57 - entire uh kind of finished product of of
06:00 - the project to get your payment this
06:02 - case even if the client's complaining
06:04 - about the final deliverable maybe you
06:06 - already have 75 percent of the income
06:08 - for the project and you're actually in a
06:10 - decent situation and you don't need to
06:11 - worry about maybe suing someone or going
06:13 - through a whole kind of massive process
06:15 - which can happen especially if you're a
06:16 - small freelance developer working for
06:18 - yourself so keep that in mind with
06:20 - Project based pricing you want to have
06:22 - the project very very well defined this
06:25 - cannot be something where it's like oh
06:26 - we need to build this and they don't
06:28 - tell you exactly what you need they
06:30 - should be defining the requirements and
06:31 - you should have a strict list of exactly
06:33 - the deliverables that you need to
06:35 - provide and what is going to be the
06:36 - criteria for success for completion if
06:39 - you hit those you need to get paid and
06:41 - you need to get paid throughout the
06:43 - project right so if you're not getting
06:44 - paid you know that 50 payment up front
06:46 - or whatever you want to charge you don't
06:48 - start work very very important you do
06:50 - that to protect yourself now for hourly
06:52 - this is going to work in much more
06:54 - Dynamic flexible situations where you're
06:56 - not sure exactly what work you're going
06:58 - to be doing or how long it's going to
06:59 - take if that's the case you're going to
07:00 - pick an hourly rate which we'll get into
07:02 - in one second and you're going to track
07:03 - exactly what you do in those hours and
07:06 - you're going to make it clear at the
07:07 - beginning through a written legal
07:09 - contract what it is that you're expected
07:11 - to do in the hours that you're working
07:13 - most important thing especially as you
07:15 - get into higher rates here guys is that
07:16 - you have everything on paper even if
07:18 - it's emails you need to have everything
07:20 - in writing there's no handshake deals
07:22 - here I can't tell you how many times
07:24 - that has gone very poorly for myself and
07:26 - for people I know get it in writing
07:29 - alright so now let's talk about actually
07:30 - picking your price first of all when
07:33 - you're pricing for a project this is
07:34 - going to be preferred you're probably
07:36 - gonna make more money this way and it's
07:37 - going to be a lot easier to justify a
07:39 - much higher rate so when possible do
07:42 - Project based pricing however again make
07:45 - sure you're protecting yourself and you
07:47 - have it very very well defined exactly
07:49 - what it is that you need to deliver so
07:50 - you know that you're not going to be
07:51 - working essentially for free to do
07:53 - something you didn't originally agree
07:55 - upon okay so if you're doing this it's
07:57 - pretty much exactly what I told you
07:58 - you're going to determine the amount of
07:59 - value you're able to provide and you're
08:01 - going to take a percentage of that back
08:03 - in compensation let's say we're making a
08:05 - website let's say the website reasonably
08:07 - will allow the company to make ten
08:08 - thousand dollars per month maybe they
08:10 - convert 100 users on the website that
08:12 - each pay them 100 bucks in this case is
08:14 - it reasonable for you to charge them ten
08:16 - thousand dollars or five thousand
08:17 - dollars to the website yes that's
08:19 - reasonable because they're gonna make
08:20 - that back in one month or two month or
08:22 - two weeks however you want to figure it
08:24 - out okay so that is a very reasonable
08:27 - way to charge for project now when
08:29 - you're charging per hour it becomes a
08:31 - bit more difficult typically what you're
08:33 - doing is very Loosely defined you don't
08:35 - have a deliverable and it's much harder
08:37 - to say hey I'm gonna provide this or
08:39 - this is the tangible finished product so
08:42 - here you're typically going to go with
08:44 - some industry standard rates which I'm
08:45 - going to share with you now and I'll
08:46 - talk about how you can bump those up all
08:48 - right so if you're in entry level or
08:50 - Junior developer this means you're
08:51 - really just getting started out you
08:53 - don't have advanced technical knowledge
08:55 - you can't do everything yourself you're
08:57 - really going to be doing smaller tasks
08:58 - scripting stuff and working for people
09:00 - that don't have any coding experience
09:01 - right if this is the case there's a lot
09:03 - of competition for what you're doing and
09:05 - you're probably going to be in the 25 to
09:07 - 50 per hour range with that said if you
09:10 - have a specialty in a specific Niche you
09:12 - know a module really well you know
09:13 - something that not a lot of other people
09:15 - in your industry know then you can bump
09:17 - this right up and you can charge
09:18 - slightly more but I would say for most
09:20 - of you you want to try to be charging 35
09:22 - to 40 dollars per hour as an entry or
09:25 - junior level developer also remember if
09:27 - you're doing this on a contract basis
09:29 - and you're working for one company a lot
09:30 - they're not paying you benefits they're
09:32 - not paying you payroll tax so whatever
09:34 - someone would be getting paid as a
09:36 - junior or entry level developer at that
09:38 - company you should be making more on an
09:40 - hourly basis than they are you don't
09:41 - have job security you don't have
09:43 - benefits you don't have any of that
09:44 - stuff so if the developers are making 30
09:46 - bucks an hour you should be making 40
09:47 - okay that's what you want to think about
09:49 - maybe even charging more now mid-level
09:52 - developers right this is probably where
09:53 - most of you will fit in I'd recommend
09:55 - you're charging around 100 per hour 50
09:58 - to 100 again depends is exactly on what
10:00 - you're doing a really good rate 75 80 85
10:04 - 90 an hour go look at job postings most
10:06 - full-time software Engineers are going
10:08 - to get paid around a hundred thousand
10:10 - dollars per year maybe eighty thousand
10:11 - dollars per year in the United States
10:13 - again depending on where you live so if
10:14 - someone's making 80k per year what does
10:16 - that work out to 40 50 bucks an hour
10:18 - something like that I don't know what
10:19 - the exact rate ends up being so if
10:21 - that's the case you probably are
10:22 - charging 65 70 75 dollars an hour again
10:25 - you're going to be above whatever the
10:27 - kind of full-time salary hourly pay
10:29 - equivalent would be you're probably
10:31 - going to be working less hours and
10:32 - you're not going to have all the
10:33 - benefits and all that other stuff lastly
10:35 - senior developers now this is where it
10:37 - gets a little bit insane this means
10:38 - you're capable of doing probably
10:40 - everything that the company needs
10:42 - whether that means you do it yourself or
10:43 - you have other people up to you but
10:45 - you're going to be charging anywhere
10:46 - from 100 to really it's kind of infinite
10:49 - but usually 200 or more per hour a lot
10:52 - of times at this point I am really
10:53 - considered a more senior developer now I
10:55 - start charging at a hundred dollars an
10:57 - hour and I'll only do a hundred dollars
10:58 - an hour if I'm building a long-term
11:00 - relationship with a company if it's
11:02 - something where I'm only going to be
11:03 - working 10 hours 20 hours swimming along
11:05 - those lines I'll usually bump it up to
11:07 - 300 400 per hour so that the company
11:10 - understands hey yeah it's a really high
11:11 - rate but I'm only working 10 hours so
11:13 - you're only gonna have to pay me Max 4K
11:15 - okay this is another thing to keep in
11:17 - mind your rate will depend on the number
11:20 - of hours projected that you're going to
11:22 - be working if you're working for a
11:23 - company you're only doing five hours
11:25 - whatever the rate is you'd normally
11:26 - charge double it or triple it because
11:28 - you're only getting five hours from that
11:30 - company and you're not getting any kind
11:31 - of relationship you're not getting any
11:33 - other benefits you may get if you're
11:35 - doing more hours with that company
11:36 - there's no consistency there's no
11:38 - reliability right whereas if a company
11:39 - is promising you minimum 20 hours per
11:41 - week or something then your rate's going
11:43 - to be slightly lower because you have
11:44 - that security of income so that's what I
11:48 - like to consider when I'm picking the
11:49 - hourly rate but none of you should be
11:51 - charging less than 25 US dollars per
11:53 - hour especially if you live in the
11:55 - United States and keep in mind that even
11:58 - though you're competing with a lot of
11:59 - other people here here you are the
12:01 - professional you are the business person
12:02 - you're gonna get it done you are a
12:05 - legitimate business right you're doing
12:06 - freelance software development you're
12:07 - not just another dude on Fiverr you're
12:09 - someone who's gonna respond who's going
12:11 - to be professional who's going to get
12:13 - the work done who's going to hit the
12:14 - standards and meet the requirements if
12:15 - you can do that you're already above 90
12:17 - of people and your rates are based on
12:20 - really what you can do and the amount of
12:22 - value you can provide it's not based on
12:24 - the competition in the market no one
12:26 - comes to me and asks for consultation
12:28 - and says oh well this guy only charges
12:29 - 300 they come to me because they know
12:31 - I'm capable of doing it and they want me
12:33 - to do it so I get to pick the rate right
12:35 - that's the position you want to be in
12:37 - obviously that takes time but I'm just
12:39 - trying to give you the full perspective
12:41 - here on how you can really make it as a
12:43 - freelance developer all right last thing
12:45 - here a few extras to consider first of
12:47 - all always have something in writing as
12:48 - I said Consulting agreement freelance
12:50 - agreement whatever you want to call it
12:52 - get a lawyer write it up for you pay the
12:54 - few hundred bucks use it as a template
12:56 - in this agreement Define first of all
12:59 - maintenance and a warranty period okay
13:01 - especially if you're doing a big project
13:02 - you want to say hey if there's any
13:04 - critical issue something that was my
13:06 - fault that I did wrong I will go in
13:08 - there and at no extra cost I will go fix
13:10 - that for you now you can write a
13:11 - specific criteria for what is going to
13:14 - be under warranty right just like any
13:16 - product or service that you buy you
13:18 - typically have a warranty if you're a
13:20 - legit professional here you're going to
13:21 - have a warranty on stuff that you're
13:22 - providing as a freelance developer
13:24 - beyond that maintenance or additional
13:26 - changes a lot of times clients are going
13:28 - to say hey can you fix this can you
13:30 - change this can you add some tax or make
13:31 - this image larger whatever something
13:33 - that wasn't originally in the required
13:35 - scope of work if you want if it's a
13:37 - small thing go ahead and do it for free
13:39 - but typically I will put in a
13:40 - maintenance hourly rate that means hey
13:43 - once all of this is finished if you want
13:45 - me to go do maintenance on this site
13:46 - this means I'm going to charge you 100
13:48 - per hour for maintenance or whatever it
13:51 - is that you want to pick for the
13:52 - maintenance rate now if you end up doing
13:54 - a lot of extra work you probably want to
13:56 - draw up an additional Consulting
13:58 - agreement where you're doing you know a
13:59 - new set of features a new set of very
14:01 - strict requirements and maybe you're
14:03 - charging a flat fee for that additional
14:05 - work all right lastly licensing and
14:07 - intellectual property very important and
14:09 - oftentimes overlooked if you're
14:11 - providing software for someone it's
14:13 - going to be implied that they own the
14:15 - software and they own the code but you
14:16 - want to put this in writing and they're
14:18 - going to want this in writing a lot of
14:19 - times so you need to be very clear that
14:21 - whatever it is that you do is their
14:23 - property if that's the way that you want
14:25 - to set it up now there's all kinds of
14:26 - other things licensing models etc etc
14:29 - sorry but you want to be very clear what
14:31 - is the company's intellectual property
14:32 - what is your intellectual property and
14:34 - what are you licensing or allowing them
14:36 - to use or what do they own once this
14:38 - work is finished okay I'm not a lawyer
14:40 - so I don't want to talk about this too
14:41 - much but look at that pay a lawyer trust
14:44 - me it's worth it get those Clauses in
14:46 - there and very clearly Define especially
14:48 - anything that you have that you don't

Cleaned transcript:

most freelance developers have no idea how much they should be charging and they miss out on thousands upon thousands of dollars by simply charging too little in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how much you should charge as a freelance developer I'm going to explain how you can justify that price and how you can adjust that depending on the client that you're working for now my name is Tim I've been a software developer for over five years I've done fulltime work freelance work I've paid freelance developers and I've gone from making about twenty dollars per hour to over 400 US dollars per hour when I do freelance and Consulting work I know that sounds insane but I promise you after you watch this video you'll understand why and how and how you can get to that same level so with that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor if you're like me then you look at your screen for 8 to 10 hours every single day making your monitor one of your most used items fortunately a few years ago I discovered Ben q and they've been my goto monitor brand since so much so that I teamed up with them and they've sponsored this video and are actually the official monitor brand of tech with Tim right now BenQ actually offers some really affordable monitors that are specifically designed for programmers under their GW line these monitors actually offer a coding mode which optimizes the contrast and saturation specifically for dark mode iCare technology USBC connection and a great quality display without breaking the bank these monitors come in 24 and 27 inch and are perfect for anyone looking to upgrade from a single laptop screen or a low quality display personally I use two 27inch gw2785 TCS for my secondary setup where I work off of my Mac laptop with one of them positioned vertically they've got speakers a microphone and best of all they offer BenQ Eye Care technology which automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen to make it easier on your eyes check them out from the link in the description and enhance your coding and efficiency today the first thing you need to understand as a freelance developer is that you are a business you may be the only developer in that business but you are a business that means that you need to maximize profits just like every other business that exists on planet Earth put aside the emotions you're not the nice guy helping out a friend you're not doing this as charitable work you're not doing it for fun or a side project you are making money keep that frame in that context whenever you get into any type of negotiation and you'll see immediately that you're going to be treated with a bit more respect and that you're gonna be able to demand higher rates now why is that the case well a lot of software developers are very nonchalant they're very relaxed they're developers after all right they want to sit in the basement they want to write code and they want to do the engineering work and that is definitely me but at the same time you need to put on that CEO kind of business hat act as a professional and go into a meeting with the idea that you're here to negotiate and you're here to figure out what the optimal exchange of value is between you and the business what you are doing as a freelance developer is you are providing value to a company or to an individual a client whatever it may be in return you're going to be compensated for that value so you need to understand how much value are you able to provide and then what percentage of that value are you going to take back as your compensation so let's give an example here when I was much younger 18 19 years old I would actually do homework assignments for friends or on sites like Fiverr so people would kind of come to me and say hey I have this python assignment I you know waited two days until it's due I'm not gonna be able to finish it can you finish it for me in that context I was only able to provide minimum value the reason for that is I'm working for a student this isn't something that's going to make them any kind of money all I'm doing is saving their grade and I'm saving them the time of completing the assignment so in that case charging 30 per hour or charging 100 or 200 for the project is a reasonable exchange of value because I'm saving them a bit of time and I'm saving them you know their grade or portion of their grade now let's switch the example up and imagine that we're working for a company that makes one million dollars per month in Revenue they sell some product or service they they have a checkout page that checkout page is poorly optimized you can go in there and optimize it fix some technical bugs and maybe that leads to five percent more people actually making it through the checkout process if that's the case you did probably the same amount of work that you might have done for another client but you were able to provide fifty thousand dollars worth of value in the first month right it's six hundred thousand dollars worth of value over the entire year in that context is it reasonable for you to charge twenty thousand dollars through that fix or twenty five thousand dollars sure it is you are only clawing back fifty percent of the value that you provided to the company from their perspective it's a nobrainer look at the ROI they just got a 200 Roi on their cost and a lot of times I'm gonna pay you until it's finished think of things like bug bounties why do they pay so much for that because the amount of money they get back from the work that you are doing is absurd so it's much more about the client that you're working for and the amount of value you can inject and provide then is what exactly you're doing or the technical skill that you have so always keep that in mind and go into your negotiation locations and meetings with the idea that you are going to figure out where you can provide the most amount of value you're going to ask the correct questions you're going to understand the type of business that you're working for and you're going to put that business and kind of CEO hat on and start the negotiation from a value proposition perspective all right so now let's dive into hourly versus per project pricing now in the majority of situations you're going to make more money if you charge per project and it's going to be a lot easier to charge a much higher rate because you're not breaking it down per hour typically you don't want to charge for your time you want to charge for your experience and the value you're able to provide however this is only the case if you have a very very welldefined project where the requirements are scoped out you know exactly what it is that you need to do and you draw up a great legal contract that defines exactly what you need to provide to be given that amount of money it also is important that you're taking a portion of that money up front and then you have some type of payment plan so you don't need to wait until the entire uh kind of finished product of of the project to get your payment this case even if the client's complaining about the final deliverable maybe you already have 75 percent of the income for the project and you're actually in a decent situation and you don't need to worry about maybe suing someone or going through a whole kind of massive process which can happen especially if you're a small freelance developer working for yourself so keep that in mind with Project based pricing you want to have the project very very well defined this cannot be something where it's like oh we need to build this and they don't tell you exactly what you need they should be defining the requirements and you should have a strict list of exactly the deliverables that you need to provide and what is going to be the criteria for success for completion if you hit those you need to get paid and you need to get paid throughout the project right so if you're not getting paid you know that 50 payment up front or whatever you want to charge you don't start work very very important you do that to protect yourself now for hourly this is going to work in much more Dynamic flexible situations where you're not sure exactly what work you're going to be doing or how long it's going to take if that's the case you're going to pick an hourly rate which we'll get into in one second and you're going to track exactly what you do in those hours and you're going to make it clear at the beginning through a written legal contract what it is that you're expected to do in the hours that you're working most important thing especially as you get into higher rates here guys is that you have everything on paper even if it's emails you need to have everything in writing there's no handshake deals here I can't tell you how many times that has gone very poorly for myself and for people I know get it in writing alright so now let's talk about actually picking your price first of all when you're pricing for a project this is going to be preferred you're probably gonna make more money this way and it's going to be a lot easier to justify a much higher rate so when possible do Project based pricing however again make sure you're protecting yourself and you have it very very well defined exactly what it is that you need to deliver so you know that you're not going to be working essentially for free to do something you didn't originally agree upon okay so if you're doing this it's pretty much exactly what I told you you're going to determine the amount of value you're able to provide and you're going to take a percentage of that back in compensation let's say we're making a website let's say the website reasonably will allow the company to make ten thousand dollars per month maybe they convert 100 users on the website that each pay them 100 bucks in this case is it reasonable for you to charge them ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars to the website yes that's reasonable because they're gonna make that back in one month or two month or two weeks however you want to figure it out okay so that is a very reasonable way to charge for project now when you're charging per hour it becomes a bit more difficult typically what you're doing is very Loosely defined you don't have a deliverable and it's much harder to say hey I'm gonna provide this or this is the tangible finished product so here you're typically going to go with some industry standard rates which I'm going to share with you now and I'll talk about how you can bump those up all right so if you're in entry level or Junior developer this means you're really just getting started out you don't have advanced technical knowledge you can't do everything yourself you're really going to be doing smaller tasks scripting stuff and working for people that don't have any coding experience right if this is the case there's a lot of competition for what you're doing and you're probably going to be in the 25 to 50 per hour range with that said if you have a specialty in a specific Niche you know a module really well you know something that not a lot of other people in your industry know then you can bump this right up and you can charge slightly more but I would say for most of you you want to try to be charging 35 to 40 dollars per hour as an entry or junior level developer also remember if you're doing this on a contract basis and you're working for one company a lot they're not paying you benefits they're not paying you payroll tax so whatever someone would be getting paid as a junior or entry level developer at that company you should be making more on an hourly basis than they are you don't have job security you don't have benefits you don't have any of that stuff so if the developers are making 30 bucks an hour you should be making 40 okay that's what you want to think about maybe even charging more now midlevel developers right this is probably where most of you will fit in I'd recommend you're charging around 100 per hour 50 to 100 again depends is exactly on what you're doing a really good rate 75 80 85 90 an hour go look at job postings most fulltime software Engineers are going to get paid around a hundred thousand dollars per year maybe eighty thousand dollars per year in the United States again depending on where you live so if someone's making 80k per year what does that work out to 40 50 bucks an hour something like that I don't know what the exact rate ends up being so if that's the case you probably are charging 65 70 75 dollars an hour again you're going to be above whatever the kind of fulltime salary hourly pay equivalent would be you're probably going to be working less hours and you're not going to have all the benefits and all that other stuff lastly senior developers now this is where it gets a little bit insane this means you're capable of doing probably everything that the company needs whether that means you do it yourself or you have other people up to you but you're going to be charging anywhere from 100 to really it's kind of infinite but usually 200 or more per hour a lot of times at this point I am really considered a more senior developer now I start charging at a hundred dollars an hour and I'll only do a hundred dollars an hour if I'm building a longterm relationship with a company if it's something where I'm only going to be working 10 hours 20 hours swimming along those lines I'll usually bump it up to 300 400 per hour so that the company understands hey yeah it's a really high rate but I'm only working 10 hours so you're only gonna have to pay me Max 4K okay this is another thing to keep in mind your rate will depend on the number of hours projected that you're going to be working if you're working for a company you're only doing five hours whatever the rate is you'd normally charge double it or triple it because you're only getting five hours from that company and you're not getting any kind of relationship you're not getting any other benefits you may get if you're doing more hours with that company there's no consistency there's no reliability right whereas if a company is promising you minimum 20 hours per week or something then your rate's going to be slightly lower because you have that security of income so that's what I like to consider when I'm picking the hourly rate but none of you should be charging less than 25 US dollars per hour especially if you live in the United States and keep in mind that even though you're competing with a lot of other people here here you are the professional you are the business person you're gonna get it done you are a legitimate business right you're doing freelance software development you're not just another dude on Fiverr you're someone who's gonna respond who's going to be professional who's going to get the work done who's going to hit the standards and meet the requirements if you can do that you're already above 90 of people and your rates are based on really what you can do and the amount of value you can provide it's not based on the competition in the market no one comes to me and asks for consultation and says oh well this guy only charges 300 they come to me because they know I'm capable of doing it and they want me to do it so I get to pick the rate right that's the position you want to be in obviously that takes time but I'm just trying to give you the full perspective here on how you can really make it as a freelance developer all right last thing here a few extras to consider first of all always have something in writing as I said Consulting agreement freelance agreement whatever you want to call it get a lawyer write it up for you pay the few hundred bucks use it as a template in this agreement Define first of all maintenance and a warranty period okay especially if you're doing a big project you want to say hey if there's any critical issue something that was my fault that I did wrong I will go in there and at no extra cost I will go fix that for you now you can write a specific criteria for what is going to be under warranty right just like any product or service that you buy you typically have a warranty if you're a legit professional here you're going to have a warranty on stuff that you're providing as a freelance developer beyond that maintenance or additional changes a lot of times clients are going to say hey can you fix this can you change this can you add some tax or make this image larger whatever something that wasn't originally in the required scope of work if you want if it's a small thing go ahead and do it for free but typically I will put in a maintenance hourly rate that means hey once all of this is finished if you want me to go do maintenance on this site this means I'm going to charge you 100 per hour for maintenance or whatever it is that you want to pick for the maintenance rate now if you end up doing a lot of extra work you probably want to draw up an additional Consulting agreement where you're doing you know a new set of features a new set of very strict requirements and maybe you're charging a flat fee for that additional work all right lastly licensing and intellectual property very important and oftentimes overlooked if you're providing software for someone it's going to be implied that they own the software and they own the code but you want to put this in writing and they're going to want this in writing a lot of times so you need to be very clear that whatever it is that you do is their property if that's the way that you want to set it up now there's all kinds of other things licensing models etc etc sorry but you want to be very clear what is the company's intellectual property what is your intellectual property and what are you licensing or allowing them to use or what do they own once this work is finished okay I'm not a lawyer so I don't want to talk about this too much but look at that pay a lawyer trust me it's worth it get those Clauses in there and very clearly Define especially anything that you have that you don't want to potentially be stolen by a company let's say you use a proprietary piece of software that you've ridden yourself that you use for all these different companies for all your freelance work well it's reasonable that a company might actually say hey well you did that while we were paying you per hour to work on this product that's ours we own that piece of software so you want to make sure you exclude that specifically so there's no question that any internal tools or software you write for your own use is not owned by that company anyways that's going to wrap up this video I
