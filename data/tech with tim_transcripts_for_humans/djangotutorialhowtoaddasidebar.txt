00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to a Jiang go
00:02 - tutorial so in today's video it's gonna
00:04 - be a little bit shorter and what we're
00:05 - gonna be doing is simply adding a
00:06 - sidebar to our website and making things
00:09 - look just a little bit nicer now in the
00:11 - next video we're gonna go on to add
00:12 - bootstrap to our website and then be
00:14 - able to make something that looks pretty
00:16 - well like this and I'll show you guys
00:18 - some more of this example in a second
00:20 - but for right now we're just gonna be
00:22 - adding this nice sidebar with some
00:23 - hovers and kind of showing you how to go
00:25 - about doing that so anyways let me give
00:27 - you a quick preview on what our website
00:29 - is going to look like in the next two
00:30 - maybe three tutorials so for example we
00:33 - have these links on the side here we can
00:35 - view all of our different to-do lists so
00:37 - if I go to a new list you can see that
00:38 - we go there we can go to create which
00:40 - will allow us to create a new to-do list
00:42 - and then obviously if we go inside of a
00:44 - to-do list we can see all these nice
00:45 - check buttons we can hit save we can add
00:48 - a new item for example by doing that and
00:50 - this is just kind of the basics I
00:52 - haven't gone crazy with this I could
00:53 - obviously make this look a lot better be
00:55 - a lot more dynamic but this only took me
00:58 - about 15-20 minutes just to style and
01:01 - make everything look decent so anyways
01:03 - that is kind of what we're gonna be
01:04 - working towards in terms of using
01:06 - bootstrap which is just some CSS that's
01:09 - pretty much already made for us and
01:11 - adding a sidebar today okay so let's get
01:15 - out of this and let's go into our what
01:18 - do you call it file here and all we're
01:19 - gonna be doing to add this sidebar is
01:21 - working inside of this base HTML file
01:24 - now because all of these files inherit
01:26 - from based on HTML this makes it really
01:28 - easy to add stuff like a sidebar to our
01:31 - website because all we have to do is add
01:33 - it into the base template it will
01:34 - automatically be added to all of the
01:36 - other ones now what I'm gonna start by
01:38 - doing is just setting up a div here
01:39 - that's gonna represent our sidebar and
01:41 - if you're not familiar with HTML and CSS
01:43 - and all this stuff I'll try to explain
01:45 - how some of this stuff works but it is
01:47 - pretty straightforward you should get it
01:48 - pretty quickly so I'm just gonna say the
01:50 - class is equal to and in this case side
01:53 - now like that and then we will end that
01:56 - div and inside here I'm just gonna put a
01:59 - few links which will be our sidebar
02:01 - items so in this case I'm gonna say
02:03 - slash home and this link name will be
02:06 - home like that and copy these a few
02:10 - times
02:11 - okay so home we'll have create and then
02:15 - we can add one more link if we want to
02:17 - but we don't actually have anywhere for
02:19 - this to really go to yet let's just do
02:22 - like / - and just call this view okay so
02:27 - it needs what I'm doing right now guys
02:28 - in case some of you are confused
02:30 - essentially is this href just stands for
02:32 - where this link is gonna go when we
02:34 - click on it a stands for link tag and
02:36 - this div is just a way that we can style
02:38 - a bunch of different elements at once
02:40 - by doing for example class equals side
02:42 - nav and now what we're gonna do is up
02:45 - here in our head tags is we're going to
02:46 - create a CSS kind of script or style
02:50 - sheet within our HTML file here and
02:52 - define what our side nav is gonna look
02:54 - like now we also need to add a class
02:57 - here to our main div because I'm gonna
02:59 - add some stuff in here in this class
03:01 - will just be called what does it mean
03:04 - like that okay so anyways what I'm gonna
03:06 - do now is go up top here and I'm just
03:08 - gonna add a bit of styling stuff to make
03:11 - this div here that we've added of links
03:13 - appear on the side of the screen and a
03:15 - certain color and then add some hover
03:17 - effects and stuff to it as well so this
03:18 - is really just gonna be adding some CSS
03:20 - at this point so I'm just gonna add some
03:22 - style tags here I will close that style
03:25 - there and in here I'm gonna do type
03:27 - equals and in this case text slash CSS
03:31 - like that and now I'm actually just
03:33 - gonna copy off my other monitor because
03:35 - I can't remember all of the styling I've
03:38 - done on this but essentially if we want
03:40 - access or change the side now the class
03:42 - what we do is we use a period
03:44 - representing a class and then we type
03:46 - the name of our class which is side nav
03:48 - we can add these brackets like this and
03:51 - then inside here is all of the styling
03:53 - we want to apply to our side nav so for
03:55 - example we want the height to be equal
03:57 - to 100 pixels which herbs are in all
04:00 - hundred pixels a hundred percent which
04:01 - means that it's gonna take up the entire
04:03 - height of the screen so you saw that on
04:05 - my left side it took up the entire
04:06 - height we're gonna say width and in this
04:08 - case we'll just give it a pixel value so
04:11 - 160 pixels and you can modify this value
04:13 - if you want we're gonna say position and
04:16 - in this case it's gonna be fixed we
04:18 - could make this a dynamic sidebar but
04:20 - I'm not gonna do that in this part we're
04:22 - gonna say is that
04:23 - index and in this case one which means
04:25 - that it's gonna stay all the way at the
04:27 - top of our screen we're gonna add top
04:29 - which is zero we're going to say the
04:32 - left zero like that which just means
04:34 - again stay in the top left-hand corner
04:36 - of our screen we're gonna say background
04:38 - and in this case is it even there it's
04:41 - not background I believe color and we're
04:44 - gonna say this is pound 1 1 1 which will
04:47 - give us that kind of dark black-ish gray
04:49 - color you guys saw before
04:51 - we'll say overflow X and this is hidden
04:55 - and I don't even remember what this one
04:57 - does oh it does say make sure that we
04:59 - don't go horizontal with our sidebar and
05:01 - then we'll do padding from the top of 20
05:05 - pixels now just to as a disclaimer here
05:08 - I did not create the sidebar I just
05:10 - found this on some like CSS website and
05:12 - modified some of the attributes so
05:14 - that's what I'm going off of here if you
05:16 - guys want to create a different kind of
05:17 - sidebar you can feel free to modify
05:19 - these kind of properties change the
05:20 - color like they're pretty
05:21 - straightforward and how they work or you
05:23 - can just look up like nice sidebar a
05:25 - nice title bar online and we'll probably
05:26 - give you the CSS and even the HTML on
05:29 - how to do that so now I'm gonna set up
05:31 - what my links inside of my sidebar are
05:34 - going to look like so whenever you want
05:35 - to specify a certain tag from within a
05:38 - class you do the class name and then the
05:40 - actual tag itself so in this case side
05:42 - nav a which means if I highlight this
05:44 - you can see it's actually highlighting
05:46 - all of these a tags here that are inside
05:48 - of my side nav so what I'm gonna do here
05:50 - is say padding and in this case we're
05:52 - gonna say 6 pixels no 8 pixels 6 pixels
05:58 - and 16 pixels and again feel free to
06:02 - mess with these numbers we're going to
06:03 - say text and in this case decoration and
06:06 - this will just be none for now and then
06:09 - down here we're gonna say font and you
06:11 - guys can mess with this as well you have
06:12 - to look up the fonts if you want to know
06:14 - what these mean is 8 1 8 1 8 1 and
06:17 - display in this case is gonna be block
06:20 - style so is that all oh sorry what am I
06:24 - saying this is color and the font I must
06:28 - have misread this here the font is gonna
06:30 - be eat just we're gonna do the font size
06:32 - which is 25 pixels like that okay so
06:35 - that's it for the side
06:36 - a tag and now all that's left to add is
06:39 - actually what happens when we hover over
06:41 - our eight tags so for example if we
06:44 - hover on these we want to change the
06:45 - color so we can do that from within CSS
06:48 - so to do that what we're gonna do is
06:49 - literally just copy this except we'll
06:52 - add this what we call it property here
06:54 - called hover and then all we're gonna do
06:56 - is just simply change the color when we
06:58 - hover so to do this we'll just change
06:59 - this color to f1f1f1 and yeah there we
07:04 - go okay so we've done that now and the
07:07 - only thing left to do actually is move
07:09 - this what do you call it this main
07:11 - content here over to the right because
07:14 - right now what we are actually gonna
07:15 - have you're gonna have the sidebar and
07:17 - then this content will go below the
07:18 - sidebar we don't want that so to move
07:20 - this content block or I guess this class
07:23 - main over that's pretty straightforward
07:25 - it'll do dot main like that and then in
07:27 - here we'll just say margin - left and in
07:31 - this case is 160 pixels did I spell
07:34 - margin correctly no I did not and we'll
07:36 - just add a bit of padding here so say
07:38 - padding and that in this case we'll do
07:41 - zero pixels and ten pixels like that now
07:44 - that should be about it actually
07:47 - for our sidebar and by applying this to
07:50 - our based on HTML file this will apply
07:53 - to our entire web site so let me
07:54 - actually get back into my wouldn't call
07:57 - it file here so I can run this for you
07:59 - guys so a CD Django tutorials CD my site
08:03 - and in this case we'll just do Python
08:04 - manage top I run server and let's grab
08:10 - this link here go to google chrome and
08:12 - let's see how this looks okay so there
08:15 - we go so we've created a nice home page
08:17 - here you can see we have home create
08:19 - view if I go to home so slash home
08:22 - doesn't exist that's just my bad I don't
08:24 - have a slash home page here uh-huh and
08:26 - if I go to create you can see we have
08:28 - this nice little create now and if I go
08:30 - to view it brings me to list item number
08:33 - two or whatever it is or to do list
08:35 - number two so that is precisely how we
08:38 - add a sidebar and you can see that this
08:40 - is a really nice thing that we have
08:42 - essentially is the fact that we have
08:43 - this based on HTML file because look I
08:46 - just applied the sidebar to my entire
08:47 - website really easily
08:50 - so now I actually I feel like I must
08:52 - have forgotten some kind of font size
08:54 - here because on my other website the
08:57 - font looks better but you know what for
09:00 - now that's just fine so anyways I that
09:03 - is actually gonna be it for this
09:04 - tutorial I know this was a bit shorter
09:06 - but this shows you how to add a sidebar
09:08 - it also kind of shows you how you can
09:09 - style some of your different items if
09:11 - you want to add some more content blocks
09:13 - or you want to add classes to specific
09:15 - things you can do exactly what I've just
09:17 - done here inside of your other files as
09:20 - well
09:20 - you can add some style tags or you can
09:22 - add the style tags here and then add the
09:24 - classes on stuff like this and yeah so
09:27 - in the next video we're gonna be adding
09:28 - bootstrap to our website which is a nice
09:30 - CSS styling and we'll make it look a
09:33 - little bit nicer to change some of the
09:34 - fonts and just make everything look a
09:36 - bit cleaner so anyways that has been it
09:38 - for this video if you guys enjoyed
09:39 - please make sure you leave a like and
09:40 - subscribe and I will see you again in
09:42 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to a Jiang go tutorial so in today's video it's gonna be a little bit shorter and what we're gonna be doing is simply adding a sidebar to our website and making things look just a little bit nicer now in the next video we're gonna go on to add bootstrap to our website and then be able to make something that looks pretty well like this and I'll show you guys some more of this example in a second but for right now we're just gonna be adding this nice sidebar with some hovers and kind of showing you how to go about doing that so anyways let me give you a quick preview on what our website is going to look like in the next two maybe three tutorials so for example we have these links on the side here we can view all of our different todo lists so if I go to a new list you can see that we go there we can go to create which will allow us to create a new todo list and then obviously if we go inside of a todo list we can see all these nice check buttons we can hit save we can add a new item for example by doing that and this is just kind of the basics I haven't gone crazy with this I could obviously make this look a lot better be a lot more dynamic but this only took me about 1520 minutes just to style and make everything look decent so anyways that is kind of what we're gonna be working towards in terms of using bootstrap which is just some CSS that's pretty much already made for us and adding a sidebar today okay so let's get out of this and let's go into our what do you call it file here and all we're gonna be doing to add this sidebar is working inside of this base HTML file now because all of these files inherit from based on HTML this makes it really easy to add stuff like a sidebar to our website because all we have to do is add it into the base template it will automatically be added to all of the other ones now what I'm gonna start by doing is just setting up a div here that's gonna represent our sidebar and if you're not familiar with HTML and CSS and all this stuff I'll try to explain how some of this stuff works but it is pretty straightforward you should get it pretty quickly so I'm just gonna say the class is equal to and in this case side now like that and then we will end that div and inside here I'm just gonna put a few links which will be our sidebar items so in this case I'm gonna say slash home and this link name will be home like that and copy these a few times okay so home we'll have create and then we can add one more link if we want to but we don't actually have anywhere for this to really go to yet let's just do like / and just call this view okay so it needs what I'm doing right now guys in case some of you are confused essentially is this href just stands for where this link is gonna go when we click on it a stands for link tag and this div is just a way that we can style a bunch of different elements at once by doing for example class equals side nav and now what we're gonna do is up here in our head

this case it's gonna be fixed we could make this a dynamic sidebar but I'm not gonna do that in this part we're gonna say is that index and in this case one which means that it's gonna stay all the way at the top of our screen we're gonna add top which is zero we're going to say the left zero like that which just means again stay in the top lefthand corner of our screen we're gonna say background and in this case is it even there it's not background I believe color and we're gonna say this is pound 1 1 1 which will give us that kind of dark blackish gray color you guys saw before we'll say overflow X and this is hidden and I don't even remember what this one does oh it does say make sure that we don't go horizontal with our sidebar and then we'll do padding from the top of 20 pixels now just to as a disclaimer here I did not create the sidebar I just found this on some like CSS website and modified some of the attributes so that's what I'm going off of here if you guys want to create a different kind of sidebar you can feel free to modify these kind of properties change the color like they're pretty straightforward and how they work or you can just look up like nice sidebar a nice title bar online and we'll probably give you the CSS and even the HTML on how to do that so now I'm gonna set up what my links inside of my sidebar are going to look like so whenever you want to specify a certain tag from within a class you do the class name and then the actual tag itself so in this case side nav a which means if I highlight this you can see it's actually highlighting all of these a tags here that are inside of my side nav so what I'm gonna do here is say padding and in this case we're gonna say 6 pixels no 8 pixels 6 pixels and 16 pixels and again feel free to mess with these numbers we're going to say text and in this case decoration and this will just be none for now and then down here we're gonna say font and you guys can mess with this as well you have to look up the fonts if you want to know what these mean is 8 1 8 1 8 1 and display in this case is gonna be block style so is that all oh sorry what am I saying this is color and the font I must have misread this here the font is gonna be eat just we're gonna do the font size which is 25 pixels like that okay so that's it for the side a tag and now all that's left to add is actually what happens when we hover over our eight tags so for example if we hover on these we want to change the color so we can do that from within CSS so to do that what we're gonna do is literally just copy this except we'll add this what we call it property here called hover and then all we're gonna do is just simply change the color when we hover so to do this we'll just change this color to f1f1f1 and yeah there we go okay so we've done that now and the only thing left to do actually is move this what do you call it this main content here over to the right because right now what we are actually gonna have you're gonna have the sidebar and then this content will go below the sidebar we don't want that so to move this content block or I guess this class main over that's pretty
