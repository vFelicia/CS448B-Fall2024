00:00 - hey guys so welcome back today I'm going
00:04 - to be doing a Python tutorial series so
00:07 - this is the first episode in the series
00:09 - kind of an introduction showing you how
00:12 - to download Python how to install it and
00:14 - then going into data types and variables
00:17 - so the first important thing to
00:18 - understand about the Python programming
00:20 - language so don't worry if you've ever
00:23 - program before I'm going to be going
00:25 - over everything very slowly and in depth
00:28 - so that you can understand I recommend
00:30 - that you follow along with everything
00:32 - I'm doing in the toriel pause the video
00:34 - at certain points rewind if you don't
00:36 - understand it's important you understand
00:38 - these parts so that we can move forward
00:39 - into more complex ideas so obviously the
00:43 - first thing that we're going to do if
00:45 - we're going to learn Python is we have
00:46 - to install it on our computer so we're
00:50 - going to go to the python website up
00:51 - here python org slash downloads right
00:54 - here and all you're going to do is just
00:56 - click download Python three point six
00:59 - point one now I'm not going to do that
01:01 - because I already have Python installed
01:03 - and downloaded on my computer but pretty
01:06 - much once you download this it's going
01:08 - to pop up down here and your downloads
01:09 - folder just run the exe it's very simple
01:12 - and you'll be running Python in no time
01:14 - so now pause the video go ahead and do
01:16 - that and then we can go to the next
01:17 - steps okay so once you've done that
01:21 - you're going to notice that you have an
01:23 - application that looks like this it's
01:25 - called IDL e Python and then it'll have
01:28 - the version so I'm using version 3.5
01:30 - don't worry if you have a version that
01:33 - is large and not so three point six or
01:35 - even one that's before that most of the
01:37 - things that I do in this will work in
01:39 - all the versions of Python okay
01:41 - so go ahead and run the IDL you'll
01:44 - notice the first thing that pops up is
01:46 - the Python shell as you can see at the
01:48 - top here at the shell now this right
01:51 - here is not where we're going to write
01:53 - all our programs
01:54 - it's the console kind of so here I can
01:58 - type any lines of code for example I
02:00 - want to print a name like this and it
02:04 - will run right away so that's not what
02:06 - we're going to do you can play around
02:07 - with this if you want but we're going to
02:09 - go to file and we're going to click new
02:11 - file
02:13 - and then here we go so now we have a new
02:16 - document that we're going to be working
02:18 - on in Remy programming so I'm going to
02:20 - go ahead and I'm going to save this
02:21 - right away as tutorial 1 into my
02:26 - tutorial folder which I believe is on my
02:28 - desktop right here yep right there
02:31 - awesome okay so there we go we've saved
02:34 - it and now we're ready to learn a little
02:36 - bit about datatypes so pretty much
02:38 - Python is a fairly basic language in
02:41 - comparison to a lot of other ones a lot
02:43 - of things that does is a more simple
02:45 - than other languages but it is important
02:47 - to understand the basic datatypes so
02:49 - there's four main data types in Python
02:51 - there is a few more but we're just going
02:53 - to talk about these ones right now the
02:55 - first one is an integer so that can be a
02:59 - short-form int that stands for integer
03:02 - now an integer is any number so such as
03:05 - 1 for 76 any whole number it's important
03:10 - that is a whole number it could be a
03:12 - negative number as well negative 5 0
03:14 - those are all integers okay now we have
03:18 - strings
03:19 - now if the short-form clear strings is
03:22 - STR now pretty much a string is anything
03:25 - embedded in quotations
03:27 - so like this this my name Tim that is a
03:30 - string and then we also have something
03:31 - like this this would be a string and
03:35 - even like this this would be a string so
03:39 - although there is a number in here since
03:41 - it is between these two quotations here
03:44 - it is a string so even if I did a Mele
03:48 - number like like that string now it's
03:52 - also important to understand that it
03:53 - doesn't matter if you use the single
03:55 - quotations or the double quotations
03:57 - sometimes we use the single quotations
04:00 - because inside of our actual quotations
04:02 - all you want to use double quotations or
04:04 - maybe if we use the double quotations
04:07 - because we want to use the single
04:09 - quotations inside of our actual string
04:11 - like that okay so those are just a few
04:13 - examples now we have boolean variables
04:18 - or datatype sorry so boolean
04:21 - datatypes is something like true
04:25 - and false so true and false pretty basic
04:29 - these are reserved words in Python
04:32 - meaning that they're highlighted in
04:34 - yellow and that you cannot use them for
04:36 - variable names that's going to be
04:37 - important later on just know that they
04:40 - are important words true and false and
04:42 - they do start with capitals so for
04:46 - example if I type true like this it's
04:48 - not highlighting orange right so that's
04:50 - because true in Python the key word for
04:53 - that starts with a capital so true and
04:55 - false then we have the decimals which is
05:00 - a float data type like this so anything
05:03 - with a decimal floating point so one
05:05 - point two three anything like that any
05:08 - decimal number with a floating decimal
05:11 - point would be a float okay so those are
05:15 - the four basic data types there is a few
05:20 - more that'll go on to later on but you
05:22 - just have to understand these ones right
05:24 - now so now that we know these data types
05:26 - I'll give a quick little quiz here so
05:29 - I'm just going to put a few things right
05:32 - here and then I want you to pause the
05:39 - video and go ahead and try to determine
05:40 - what type of data type these things are
05:46 - okay so go ahead pause the video and
05:48 - then I'll go over the answers in a
05:50 - second okay so we'll start with the
05:53 - first one here hello it's the same
05:55 - example that I have up here except in
05:57 - single quotations so we can see that it
05:59 - is a string data type okay so that is
06:02 - the short-form STR now we have the
06:05 - number 123 that would be the integer
06:08 - data type we have another number here
06:11 - that has a decimal point so 3.2 - that
06:14 - would be a float we have the keyword
06:17 - true this data type is a boolean data
06:20 - type then we have two in quotations this
06:24 - is very important we don't want to get
06:25 - this mixed up this is a string some
06:28 - people may think that it's an integer
06:29 - because it's two but no it actually is a
06:32 - string because it is inside of the
06:34 - quotations and then same thing here
06:36 - three inside of the double quotations
06:38 - is a string and not an integer okay so
06:41 - now that we have an idea of the basic
06:43 - datatypes I'm going to show you how to
06:46 - create a variable so pretty much you may
06:49 - have heard of variables before in math
06:51 - or something like that
06:52 - in math we tend to use X as a variable
06:55 - we say X maybe five X maybe four
06:57 - anything like that
06:59 - it's the same thing in Python now
07:01 - declaring a variable in Python is very
07:03 - easy all you have to do is type the
07:05 - variable name so in this case I'm going
07:07 - to use name and then simply give it a
07:10 - value so this value as you may remember
07:12 - is a string this is my name and I'm
07:14 - destroying it in the variable name now
07:18 - if I want to access that variable I want
07:20 - to see what that variable is I can print
07:23 - it to the console by simply typing the
07:26 - variable name which is name so now we'll
07:29 - see what happens if I run the program
07:31 - it's going to run run module I'm going
07:33 - to use f5 from now on so that's the
07:35 - thing and you can see it prints out Tim
07:38 - just like that okay now say we did that
07:42 - we have name equals 10 we printed it to
07:44 - the screen now maybe we want to change
07:46 - that variable well it's very easy again
07:49 - all we have to do is just type the value
07:51 - name and now maybe we going to change it
07:53 - to Bob and now we want to see what the
07:55 - new very new variable is so we will
07:57 - print it to the screen or print name
08:00 - click f5 to run that and we'll see name
08:03 - and I are sorry Tim and then Bob so like
08:06 - we have here name equals Tim print name
08:09 - name equals Bob print name right
08:12 - so you set it like that okay so that's
08:14 - pretty basic um now you can create
08:17 - variables of different data types so for
08:19 - example if we had a variable age I would
08:22 - use an integer data type so like 18 for
08:25 - that variable and then again if I wanted
08:27 - to print it to the screen I would say
08:28 - print and then the variable name like
08:31 - that
08:32 - okay 80 perfect right so we printed that
08:35 - to the screen again if the variable
08:39 - names there's a few restrictions on
08:42 - variable names so here you just see I've
08:45 - used three lowercase letters your
08:47 - variable names can contain underscore
08:51 - they cannot contain dashes they can only
08:53 - contain underscores text and they cannot
08:56 - start with a number I believe so if I
08:58 - try to do one one name equals two for
09:03 - example I run into an invalid syntax
09:06 - error because we can't name a variable
09:09 - starting with a number now I can end it
09:11 - with a number I believe
09:13 - let's try yep so that's fine it's let us
09:19 - do that name equals one I could do name
09:21 - underscore person maybe yeah name
09:26 - underscore person you see if I run that
09:27 - program everything's fine there but I
09:31 - can't put something like a star in my
09:34 - variable name you see how we've got an
09:38 - invalid syntax there right this is
09:40 - because these symbols represent
09:41 - something else in the Python language so
09:44 - just know four names we can use capital
09:47 - as if we'd like I could use name like
09:48 - that so then the program that works fine
09:53 - but I cannot start it with numbers so I
09:55 - cannot put a number there and I cannot
09:57 - contain anything other than underscores
09:59 - texts and numbers in or at the end of
10:03 - the variable name now here's a quiz for
10:06 - you if I make a variable called name do
10:09 - another variable called name are they
10:13 - the same thing now that's a good
10:16 - question are these two the same thing no
10:20 - they are not the same thing so capitals
10:21 - do matter in Python the all capitals
10:24 - variable name is different than the
10:27 - variable name so again name like this is
10:30 - different than all of those variables
10:33 - there okay so I think I've covered a
10:35 - little bit on variables and data types
10:38 - today I'm just to be complete basics
10:41 - just wanting to get everyone caught up
10:43 - in the next video we'll go into some
10:46 - more advanced things maybe operations of
10:48 - variables adding them together
10:50 - subtracting multiplying boolean
10:53 - conditions things like that ok so I hope
10:56 - you enjoyed the video today stay tuned
10:58 - and we're going to have another one out
11:00 - tomorrow and like the video if you
11:03 - if it was good and subscribe so yeah
11:05 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys so welcome back today I'm going to be doing a Python tutorial series so this is the first episode in the series kind of an introduction showing you how to download Python how to install it and then going into data types and variables so the first important thing to understand about the Python programming language so don't worry if you've ever program before I'm going to be going over everything very slowly and in depth so that you can understand I recommend that you follow along with everything I'm doing in the toriel pause the video at certain points rewind if you don't understand it's important you understand these parts so that we can move forward into more complex ideas so obviously the first thing that we're going to do if we're going to learn Python is we have to install it on our computer so we're going to go to the python website up here python org slash downloads right here and all you're going to do is just click download Python three point six point one now I'm not going to do that because I already have Python installed and downloaded on my computer but pretty much once you download this it's going to pop up down here and your downloads folder just run the exe it's very simple and you'll be running Python in no time so now pause the video go ahead and do that and then we can go to the next steps okay so once you've done that you're going to notice that you have an application that looks like this it's called IDL e Python and then it'll have the version so I'm using version 3.5 don't worry if you have a version that is large and not so three point six or even one that's before that most of the things that I do in this will work in all the versions of Python okay so go ahead and run the IDL you'll notice the first thing that pops up is the Python shell as you can see at the top here at the shell now this right here is not where we're going to write all our programs it's the console kind of so here I can type any lines of code for example I want to print a name like this and it will run right away so that's not what we're going to do you can play around with this if you want but we're going to go to file and we're going to click new file and then here we go so now we have a new document that we're going to be working on in Remy programming so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to save this right away as tutorial 1 into my tutorial folder which I believe is on my desktop right here yep right there awesome okay so there we go we've saved it and now we're ready to learn a little bit about datatypes so pretty much Python is a fairly basic language in comparison to a lot of other ones a lot of things that does is a more simple than other languages but it is important to understand the basic datatypes so there's four main data types in Python there is a few more but we're just going to talk about these ones right now the first one is an integer so that can be a shortform int that stands for integer now an integer is any number so such as 1 for 76 any whole number it's important that is a whole number it could be a negative number as well negative 5 0 those are all integers okay now we have strings now if the shortform clear strings is STR now pretty much a string is anything embedded in quotations so like this this my name Tim that is a string and then we also have something like this this would be a string and even like this this would be a string so although there is a number in here since it is between these two quotations here it is a string so even if I did a Mele number like like that string now it's also important to understand that it doesn't matter if you use the single quotations or the double quotations sometimes we use the single quotations because inside of our actual quotations all you want to use double quotations or maybe if we use the double quotations because we want to use the single quotations inside of our actual string like that okay so those are just a few examples now we have boolean variables or datatype sorry so boolean datatypes is something like true and false so true and false pretty basic these are reserved words in Python meaning that they're highlighted in yellow and that you cannot use them for variable names that's going to be important later on just know that they are important words true and false and they do start with capitals so for example if I type true like this it's not highlighting orange right so that's because true in Python the key word for that starts with a capital so true and false then we have the decimals which is a float data type like this so anything with a decimal floating point so one point two three anything like that any decimal number with a floating decimal point would be a float okay so those are the four basic data types there is a few more that'll go on to later on but you just have to understand these ones right now so now that we know these data types I'll give a quick little quiz here so I'm just going to put a few things right here and then I want you to pause the video and go ahead and try to determine what type of data type these things are okay so go ahead pause the video and then I'll go over the answers in a second okay so we'll start with the first one here hello it's the same example that I have up here except in single quotations so we can see that it is a string data type okay so that is the shortform STR now we have the number 123 that would be the integer data type we have another number here that has a decimal point so 3.2 that would be a float we have the keyword true this data type is a boolean data type then we have two in quotations this is very important we don't want to get this mixed up this is a string some people may think that it's an integer because it's two but no it actually is a string because it is inside of the quotations and then same thing here three inside of the double quotations is a string and not an integer okay so now that we have an idea of the basic datatypes I'm going to show you how to create a variable so pretty much you may have heard of variables before in math or something like that in math we tend to use X as a variable we say X maybe five X maybe four anything like that it's the same thing in Python now declaring a variable in Python is very easy all you have to do is type the variable name so in this

so we will print it to the screen or print name click f5 to run that and we'll see name and I are sorry Tim and then Bob so like we have here name equals Tim print name name equals Bob print name right so you set it like that okay so that's pretty basic um now you can create variables of different data types so for example if we had a variable age I would use an integer data type so like 18 for that variable and then again if I wanted to print it to the screen I would say print and then the variable name like that okay 80 perfect right so we printed that to the screen again if the variable names there's a few restrictions on variable names so here you just see I've used three lowercase letters your variable names can contain underscore they cannot contain dashes they can only

cannot put a number there and I cannot contain anything other than underscores texts and numbers in or at the end of the variable name now here's a quiz for you if I make a variable called name do another variable called name are they the same thing now that's a good question are these two the same thing no they are not the same thing so capitals do matter in Python the all capitals variable name is different than the variable name so again name like this is different than all of those variables there okay so I think I've covered a little bit on variables and data types today I'm just to be complete basics just wanting to get everyone caught up in the next video we'll go into some more advanced things maybe operations of variables adding them together subtracting multiplying boolean conditions things like that ok so I hope you enjoyed the video today stay tuned and we're going to have another one out tomorrow and like the video if you if it was good and subscribe so yeah thank
