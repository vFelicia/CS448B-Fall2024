00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - in today's video I'm just going to
00:04 - showing you some cool visual basic
00:06 - scripts that you can use to scare your
00:09 - friends or just to play around with and
00:11 - just to see some cool things that you
00:12 - can make your computer do so in this
00:15 - example I'm going to be showing you kind
00:16 - of like a fake virus kind of a script
00:19 - it's kind of cheesy kind of some of the
00:21 - stuff I made it a few years ago so don't
00:23 - judge it too hard but yeah and then I'm
00:25 - gonna be showing you pretty much how to
00:27 - code it really quickly just giving you
00:29 - some of the commands then you can play
00:30 - around with it at home and if you want
00:32 - to have this file I'm going to leave the
00:33 - text version of it in the description
00:36 - below so that you can just copy and
00:38 - paste it if you don't want to write it
00:39 - up by yourself and then I'll leave one
00:41 - other file down below which is another
00:43 - kind of virus one but I'm not going to
00:44 - show it in this one so the first thing
00:46 - we're going to do then right away is I'm
00:47 - just going to show you what this looks
00:49 - like and you see if you're interested in
00:50 - it or not so pretty much it pops up and
00:54 - you've just got a little window here and
00:56 - just kind of those warning you saying
00:58 - are you sure you want to open this file
00:59 - like it looks like it's like corrupted
01:01 - and then here it really doesn't matter
01:03 - which one you click it's always going to
01:04 - be the same thing and then again some
01:08 - more text boxes are going to pop up I'm
01:11 - just going to let it run through and you
01:12 - can just read it yourself so again all
01:21 - of this is just fake stuff right it's
01:23 - just like this are you scared yet and
01:25 - then it's going to put your username in
01:26 - there and then whatever again doesn't
01:28 - matter what you click it's still gonna
01:30 - just say the same thing here and then a
01:34 - bunch of more things are going to keep
01:35 - popping up yeah we got registry error
01:39 - here
01:40 - and then I just type in a few commands
01:42 - and the command prompt here opening that
01:44 - up and it looks somewhat real some of
01:46 - this I mean it's kind of cool if someone
01:48 - doesn't really know anything about
01:49 - computers and you want to try to kind of
01:51 - scare them a little bit this is a good
01:53 - way to do it and then that's all I've
01:55 - got there just goes to deleting C Drive
01:57 - I mean I could make it go on for a long
01:58 - time and do some more but that's just an
02:00 - example just to show you guys how to use
02:02 - a VBS a little bit of Visual Basic VBS
02:05 - same thing so yeah let's get into the
02:08 - code then so that's pretty much how the
02:09 - file works is a few popups message boxes
02:13 - some keys that are being typed out
02:14 - pretty basic thing so the first thing we
02:17 - need to do is you just need to open a
02:18 - text editor so in this case I'm going to
02:21 - open up notepad plus plus you can use
02:24 - notepad regular notepad whatever you
02:25 - want doesn't matter so this is the file
02:27 - that I was using
02:28 - I'll just scroll through it quickly and
02:30 - you can see it's pretty repetitive it's
02:32 - just the same things over and over again
02:34 - and then there's a few like message
02:36 - boxes and some variables and stuff but
02:38 - nothing too complex so we'll just create
02:40 - a new file and we'll start from scratch
02:42 - so a new file here first thing we need
02:44 - to do is need to save the file so let's
02:47 - just go file and then save as and we'll
02:50 - save it into this hacks folder share and
02:52 - let's say virus totally not a sketchy
02:55 - name so VBS now we need to go down here
02:58 - in the save type and we need to change
03:00 - it to a VBS file so go all the way down
03:03 - to the bottom when you see you Visual
03:04 - Basic so VB your VBS and we'll do that
03:07 - there we go and we'll just change this
03:09 - to s VBS like that and save it okay so
03:13 - now let's go ahead and let us start
03:15 - typing so the first line we need to type
03:18 - is as so you don't worry about what a
03:20 - lot of this means just type it out the
03:22 - works owsh shell is equal to and the
03:27 - capitals do matter in this i'll remind
03:29 - you again w script dot create object so
03:35 - this creating object is creating a new
03:37 - new task in our task vendor and then w
03:41 - script dot show just like that you know
03:45 - what i actually think we need double
03:47 - quotations here it may not matter but
03:48 - let's just make sure that we need to use
03:49 - the doubles all right and now i'm going
03:53 - to show you some of the commands that I
03:54 - used in my program to make that thing
03:57 - because you can make yours as unique as
03:59 - you want as long as you want as short as
04:01 - you want and yeah there's a lot of other
04:03 - cool VBS stuff and I'm going to make
04:05 - some more videos on some cool viruses
04:07 - too that you can kind of make okay so
04:10 - the first thing we'll do here is I'll
04:12 - show you how to run a program so we're
04:15 - just going to do W SH so what we've
04:17 - typed up above there and then shell oops
04:21 - my capitals are off there and then don't
04:24 - run like this
04:26 - and then in double quotations you should
04:27 - type the program you want to run in this
04:29 - case I want to do CMD so now if I
04:32 - actually run this program so by doing
04:34 - that I have to find my directory so I
04:36 - think it's in this little hacks folder I
04:38 - have here yep and then if I go virus VBS
04:41 - you'll see right now all it does is it
04:42 - just runs the command prompt like that
04:45 - for us so I've actually I've
04:46 - accidentally closed some of these things
04:48 - so I'll reopen them okay so it just runs
04:50 - the command prompt so that's pretty
04:51 - basic and now we'll talk about the how
04:55 - to get the keys in put it in there so if
04:57 - you saw before in mind it was like
04:59 - typing out words and had some words that
05:01 - popped up on the screen so this is how
05:03 - you do this
05:04 - it's just W SH and then shell so same
05:08 - thing we just typed and then dot send
05:10 - keys and then you're just going to type
05:13 - the key that you want to send so the key
05:15 - that you want types in this case I'll
05:16 - just do H and then after this we're
05:20 - going to want to pause the program for a
05:21 - few seconds so that it looks like it's
05:23 - being typed onto the screen so we'll
05:26 - just do this so lewd w oops sorry w
05:30 - script dot sleep and then the amount of
05:34 - time you want to sleep in milliseconds
05:36 - so 1000 milliseconds is one second we
05:38 - don't want to quite goes out long we'll
05:40 - do about 400 and then what I did in my
05:43 - program is since I want to type out a
05:44 - word so in this case we'll do hello I
05:47 - just kept copying this and then I just
05:50 - changed these letters so I'll change
05:52 - that to e change that to L change that's
05:55 - L make this oh look that pretty basic
05:59 - and then if you want to get a message
06:02 - box going after that through this is the
06:05 - way that you can do it there's two
06:06 - different ways and there's a lot of
06:07 - different types of message boxes I'm
06:08 - just going to be showing you the error
06:10 - message box today if you want to mess
06:11 - around with different types of message
06:13 - boxes and have like if you saw my first
06:15 - one I had a bunch of different keys like
06:17 - a board retry you can just look that up
06:19 - on find a different video or something
06:21 - on Macs I'm not going to show that today
06:22 - so all you have to do is just type
06:24 - message box like this and then where
06:30 - you're going to do for that is you're
06:31 - going to type in what you want to say so
06:33 - in this case I'll just say like
06:35 - err oops if I could spell err correctly
06:40 - then a comma
06:41 - oops I spelt it wrong again alright err
06:44 - like that a comma the type of message
06:47 - box so like the keys I'm pretty sure
06:49 - this one is so I'm going to do 48 and
06:51 - then we are going to do err so not in
06:57 - brackets were just gonna type air like
06:59 - that and you see how it highlights an
07:00 - orange so we know that's a key word
07:02 - right and now let's try to run this so
07:05 - if I go back to my directory wherever
07:08 - that is and we run it let's just see
07:10 - what happens so again you see we're
07:14 - typing a low just like that so we missed
07:16 - the H not sure quite why and then we get
07:18 - message box that pops up and it says air
07:20 - just like that so yeah that's pretty
07:24 - much how you can do some of the
07:25 - different message boxes and sending the
07:27 - keys now I'll show you one more how we
07:29 - type the what do you call it sorry how
07:33 - we like hit enter so if you want to go a
07:35 - new line then if we want to hit enter
07:38 - then we can do that so we'll just do the
07:39 - same thing here W sh sh l dot send keys
07:45 - and then this time same thing double
07:48 - quotations then we're going to use the
07:49 - curly brackets and we're going to type
07:50 - enter in here and then you'll see again
07:53 - if I run the program opening our
07:55 - directory then it will actually tab down
07:57 - one and the reason it's not typing hello
08:00 - is because we didn't do a delay after we
08:04 - ran the CMD so it did H before CMD was
08:07 - actually opened if that makes sense to
08:08 - you guys so yeah that's pretty much all
08:11 - you have to do to make a cool little
08:14 - virus thing I'm going to put the code
08:16 - from my original one in the description
08:18 - so if you just want to copy and paste
08:19 - that feel free and then this is just
08:21 - showing you how you guys can kind of
08:22 - customize a little bit by yourself and
08:24 - maybe scare your friends yeah so if you
08:27 - liked the video please like and
08:29 - subscribe and I'm going to be doing some
08:30 - more VBS stuff on my channel so yeah

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm just going to showing you some cool visual basic scripts that you can use to scare your friends or just to play around with and just to see some cool things that you can make your computer do so in this example I'm going to be showing you kind of like a fake virus kind of a script it's kind of cheesy kind of some of the stuff I made it a few years ago so don't judge it too hard but yeah and then I'm gonna be showing you pretty much how to code it really quickly just giving you some of the commands then you can play around with it at home and if you want to have this file I'm going to leave the text version of it in the description below so that you can just copy and paste it if you don't want to write it up by yourself and then I'll leave one other file down below which is another kind of virus one but I'm not going to show it in this one so the first thing we're going to do then right away is I'm just going to show you what this looks like and you see if you're interested in it or not so pretty much it pops up and you've just got a little window here and just kind of those warning you saying are you sure you want to open

in there and then whatever again doesn't matter what you click it's still gonna just say the same thing here and then a bunch of more things are going to keep popping up yeah we got registry error here and then I just type in a few commands and the command prompt here opening that up and it looks somewhat real some of this I mean it's kind of cool if someone doesn't really know anything about computers and you want to try to kind of scare them a little bit this is a good way to do it and then that's all I've got there just goes to deleting C Drive I mean I could make it go on for a long

yeah
