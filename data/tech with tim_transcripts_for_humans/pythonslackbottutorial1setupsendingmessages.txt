00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:10 - new tutorial series on building a slack
00:13 - bot
00:13 - in python now i'll quickly introduce
00:15 - what slack is in case any of you are not
00:17 - aware
00:18 - but slack is just another messaging
00:20 - platform it's similar to something like
00:21 - discord maybe even comparable to
00:23 - something like microsoft teams
00:25 - i know a lot of large companies use
00:27 - slack for their main communication
00:29 - the nice thing with it is it's really
00:30 - easy to direct message people
00:33 - you can add teammates you have a bunch
00:35 - of different channels there's all kinds
00:36 - of emojis you can have some nice
00:38 - formatted messages
00:39 - i don't use slack all that often but a
00:41 - lot of you guys have been asking me to
00:43 - make a slack bot so i figured i would go
00:45 - ahead and make this tutorial series
00:47 - now in this series i'm going to be
00:49 - making kind of shorter videos aiming to
00:51 - have them about 10 to 15 minutes in
00:53 - length
00:53 - that show you kind of individual things
00:55 - so the first thing we're going to do in
00:57 - this video is just configure the slack
00:58 - bot which will actually take a good
01:00 - amount of time
01:01 - and then we'll actually add it into a
01:02 - channel and have it so it sends a
01:04 - message
01:05 - that will just show you the basics and
01:06 - the setup then from there what we'll do
01:09 - is we'll configure events so essentially
01:11 - allowing us to
01:12 - subscribe to specific events so if a
01:14 - user
01:15 - you know messages in a channel that will
01:17 - send us that
01:18 - message or send us an event that
01:20 - happened we can handle that event and
01:22 - then maybe we could reply to them
01:23 - we could track that message we can see
01:25 - if they send a command
01:26 - so on so forth we can do all kinds of
01:28 - stuff like that so you'll see what we're
01:30 - going to do later in the tutorial series
01:32 - but let's go ahead and get started
01:34 - the first thing we're going to need to
01:35 - do here is just make a new workspace
01:37 - so you can see right now i'm in the
01:39 - workspace i was using before
01:40 - i called it python api tutorial just the
01:42 - slack api
01:44 - i was just messing around before
01:46 - preparing for this tutorial
01:47 - but to create a new workspace you're
01:49 - going to have to obviously make an
01:50 - account on slack
01:51 - i'm going to assume you can figure out
01:52 - how to do that on your own and then if
01:54 - you're already in a workspace for some
01:56 - reason you can click on it and then
01:57 - click add
01:58 - workspace so i've already got that open
02:00 - here this is the page that will pop up
02:02 - when you press add workspace you need to
02:05 - insert an email
02:06 - i'll get my email to actually be blurred
02:08 - here i don't want you guys to see that
02:09 - and then i will click
02:10 - continue all right it's going to send me
02:12 - a confirmation code i'll go ahead and
02:14 - set this up and then once the workspace
02:15 - is ready i'll be right back
02:17 - all right so i went ahead and configured
02:19 - that i guess i'll just call this one
02:20 - slackbot tutorial
02:22 - i'll just label this one youtube so i
02:24 - can differentiate these two
02:26 - and now i have a new workspace i'm not
02:29 - going to add any
02:30 - teammates here let's skip that step and
02:33 - i guess we'll say hello team
02:35 - as our first message all right so here
02:37 - we are we are in our new workspace
02:39 - now what we're going to do is go ahead
02:41 - and head over to the slack api website
02:43 - all of the links here will be in the
02:44 - description you can find them down below
02:47 - and we're going to configure our first
02:49 - app so what i'm going to do is press on
02:51 - my app right here are your apps in the
02:53 - top corner
02:54 - you'll notice that i already have one
02:56 - right here your page may look a little
02:58 - bit different
02:58 - but all we're going to do is press
03:00 - create new app and go ahead and give it
03:02 - a name and then choose what workspace
03:04 - we want this to be in so i'm going to go
03:05 - ahead and name this one
03:07 - youtube bot like that
03:10 - and then i'll put this inside of
03:11 - slackbot tutorial for youtube
03:14 - all right so create app and now you can
03:16 - see we're on the kind of the dashboard
03:18 - here and we're gonna have to do is
03:19 - configure a bunch of different things
03:21 - so the first thing that we're going to
03:23 - do here is we're actually going to go
03:24 - ahead and go to bots
03:26 - like this and we're going to go to
03:27 - review scopes and add so essentially we
03:30 - need to give our bot permissions
03:32 - for whatever it's going to be doing in
03:34 - the channel so we can pick how many
03:35 - permissions we want it to have
03:37 - it can merely just read messages or it
03:39 - can send messages or it can add
03:41 - reactions or it can view email addresses
03:43 - and all kinds of different things like
03:45 - that so what we're going to do is go
03:46 - down here to add in oauth scope
03:49 - essentially the scopes are just the
03:50 - permissions that we have for our bot
03:52 - in whatever workspace we're in so here
03:55 - we can see there's a bunch of different
03:57 - scopes they have permissions for
03:58 - what they all do you obviously could add
04:00 - all of them if you wanted to but right
04:02 - now we only need one
04:03 - and we just need the chat and then right
04:06 - one so i need to find where that is
04:08 - uh chat chat chat come on where are you
04:11 - chat
04:12 - right is somewhere okay so i found it i
04:16 - just searched right here and then it
04:17 - popped up i have chat
04:18 - right okay so that's all we need this
04:20 - just allows us to send messages in a
04:22 - chat
04:22 - later on we will add other permissions
04:24 - and you'll see how we actually figure
04:26 - out which ones we need to add
04:27 - but for now that's all we need the next
04:29 - thing that we need to do is actually
04:31 - generate a
04:32 - token for our bot so to do that we first
04:34 - need to install this into our workspace
04:36 - and then i believe we can generate a
04:38 - token
04:38 - we're going to take that token copy that
04:40 - on our clipboard and then we'll add that
04:42 - to our actual python code which we'll
04:44 - start writing in a second so i'm going
04:45 - to say install
04:46 - app here we can say you know this is
04:49 - what it's allowed to do perform actions
04:51 - and channels and conversations
04:53 - we will allow that and there we go
04:56 - so now you can see we get a token for
04:58 - your workspace so i'm going to copy that
05:00 - token right here
05:02 - i will blur this out just so you guys
05:03 - don't see it and mess with my
05:05 - slack bot but just something to note
05:07 - here that if we add
05:08 - any more scopes we will need to
05:11 - reinstall this app into our workspace
05:13 - so if you mess with any of these scopes
05:15 - you're going to need to reinstall this
05:16 - i don't think the token will change when
05:18 - you do that
05:19 - but just keep in mind it will ask you to
05:21 - reinstall this in the workspace if you
05:23 - mess around with any
05:24 - of the scopes all right so now that we
05:26 - have that we're actually kind of good to
05:27 - go and we can head over to our python
05:29 - code
05:30 - so i'm in vs code right now this is the
05:31 - editor i'm going to use for this
05:33 - tutorial
05:33 - of course you guys can use whatever you
05:35 - want but i'm going to start by just
05:36 - making a new python file
05:38 - and calling this bot.pi you can call
05:40 - this whatever you want it does not need
05:42 - to be called bot.pi
05:43 - i'm also going to make another file here
05:45 - and i'm going to call this dot env
05:47 - now dot env is standing for our
05:49 - environment variable
05:51 - file so this is going to hold our token
05:53 - and a few other things that we'll need
05:55 - later on so that we can actually connect
05:57 - to our workspace and to our slack bot
06:00 - so the first thing i'm going to do in
06:01 - here is i'm going to say slack
06:02 - underscore token
06:03 - equals without a space and then i'm
06:05 - going to paste that token that i had
06:07 - from the slack api so go ahead and do
06:10 - that dot env
06:11 - so just period as the start you should
06:13 - see a little gear icon popping up if
06:15 - you're in vs code if you're not vs code
06:17 - that's totally fine
06:18 - just make sure these two files the
06:19 - python file and the env file are in the
06:22 - same directory
06:23 - then go ahead and save this file now
06:25 - what we're going to
06:26 - need to do next is install some python
06:28 - packages using
06:29 - pip so if you're not familiar with pip i
06:31 - actually don't know what it stands for i
06:33 - always call it
06:34 - uh package installer for python but i
06:36 - know that's not the correct name
06:37 - but anyways we need to go to our command
06:39 - prompt on our system
06:41 - if you are on mac in linux this is going
06:42 - to be a little bit different so i'll
06:44 - explain those steps in one second
06:45 - but start by just typing pip so p i p
06:49 - we type that and you should see some
06:51 - output popping up now this obviously
06:53 - assumes you have python installed on
06:55 - your system
06:55 - now for some reason pip is not working i
06:58 - have a video on my channel
06:59 - that explains how to install pygame so
07:02 - if you follow that what it will actually
07:03 - do is show you how to reconfigure your
07:05 - pip
07:06 - obviously when you get to the step where
07:07 - you're installing pi game rather than
07:09 - installing pi game install the module
07:11 - i'm about to show you here
07:12 - so if pip is working for you then what
07:14 - you're going to do if you're on windows
07:16 - in your command prompt is do pip install
07:18 - spell install correctly
07:20 - and then slack and spell slack correctly
07:23 - client this is what we're going to need
07:25 - to use to actually connect to our slack
07:27 - client
07:28 - so we'll just pip install slack clients
07:30 - now oops let me go back to command
07:32 - prompt here
07:33 - the next thing that we're going to need
07:34 - to do is install python hyphen
07:37 - dot env now what this is going to do is
07:39 - allow us to read from this environment
07:41 - variable file
07:42 - i just always like to use this module it
07:44 - makes things a lot easier so pip
07:46 - install python hyphen dot env make sure
07:49 - you
07:49 - add the python hyphen before all right
07:52 - so we're going to install that
07:53 - you can see that we're already satisfied
07:54 - for me but you guys should see some kind
07:56 - of loading bars
07:57 - and everything should be working now if
07:58 - you're on linux or you're on mac
08:00 - this will be the exact same steps except
08:02 - you're going to go to terminal
08:04 - and instead of pip you're going to type
08:05 - pip 3. so pip 3 should be the only
08:07 - difference here
08:08 - and if that doesn't work for you again i
08:10 - have another video that shows you how to
08:11 - reconfigure pip on mac so that works so
08:14 - i will leave that in the description as
08:15 - well
08:15 - and maybe put a card somewhere on the
08:17 - screen all right now that we have that
08:19 - what we're going to do is go inside of
08:21 - our bot.pi file
08:22 - and start writing some code so the first
08:24 - thing i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:25 - import
08:26 - slack next i'm going to import os which
08:28 - stands for operating system i believe
08:30 - and then we're going to import something
08:32 - from pathflip
08:34 - now pathlib is built into python 3 by
08:36 - default
08:37 - i will note right now that you need to
08:38 - use python 3.6 or above so you should
08:41 - already be using that version but you do
08:43 - need that
08:43 - so actually i'm going to say not import
08:45 - pathway but i'm going to say from
08:47 - pathlib
08:48 - import and then with a capital p path
08:51 - and then i'm going to say
08:52 - from oops if i can
08:55 - type correctly here from dot env import
08:59 - load underscore dot env what this is
09:02 - going to do is simply load our
09:03 - environment variable file so the first
09:05 - thing i'm going to do is say env
09:07 - underscore path which stands for our
09:09 - environment variable file path
09:11 - is equal to path and then i'm going to
09:14 - put a dot inside of a string here
09:16 - this stands for current directory then
09:18 - i'm going to add a slash
09:19 - and i'm going to do env with a period
09:22 - before it
09:23 - so this is just denoting where the path
09:25 - for our file is so that we can load it
09:28 - next we're going to say load.env and
09:30 - then we're going to say
09:31 - dot env underscore path equals env
09:34 - underscore path
09:35 - again just loading this environment
09:36 - variable file which will load the
09:38 - environment variable that we had inside
09:40 - of there
09:41 - next what we're going to do is we're
09:42 - going to say rtm client which is just
09:44 - the client that we're
09:45 - sorry not rtm client what am i saying
09:47 - this should be client
09:49 - is equal to slack dot web
09:52 - clients web client is what we're going
09:54 - to use for this tutorial
09:55 - there is some other clients built into
09:57 - slack here
09:58 - i'm not really going to talk about them
10:00 - it's just part of the slack api in this
10:02 - specific module
10:03 - in our case we're going to use the web
10:04 - client so we're going to say
10:06 - client equals slack dot web client and
10:08 - then we're going to say token
10:10 - equals os dot environ or however you say
10:14 - that
10:14 - and then inside of square brackets we're
10:16 - going to put the name of the environment
10:17 - variable that we had here
10:19 - so in this case i put slack token so i'm
10:22 - going to go ahead and put slack token
10:23 - inside of here
10:24 - and what this should do is load the
10:26 - actual value from this file
10:28 - and then kind of pass that in as our
10:30 - token so that is how we're going to
10:32 - store the token the reason i'm not just
10:34 - storing it in plain text here
10:36 - is because it's better practice to load
10:38 - this as an environment variable
10:39 - and say you had this on a github
10:41 - repository or something you would simply
10:43 - upload all of the code and you just
10:44 - wouldn't upload this environment
10:46 - variable file
10:47 - so that way no one knows what your token
10:49 - is so hopefully that makes sense
10:50 - all right so now we have client this
10:52 - should actually be working
10:54 - what we're going to do is go ahead and
10:55 - run this and see if this works
10:58 - all right so i got an annoying error
11:00 - here that's saying no module named slack
11:02 - now it's actually good that i ran into
11:03 - this because i wanted to cover this for
11:05 - you guys
11:06 - what happens here is that slack recently
11:09 - like the their api for it or the python
11:11 - package has been changed a bunch
11:13 - so if this doesn't work for you for some
11:15 - reason what you're going to need to do
11:16 - is simply
11:17 - uninstall slack so pip uninstall slack
11:20 - clients like that and then just simply
11:23 - reinstall it afterwards so in this case
11:24 - i'm going to say yes we will remove all
11:26 - of that
11:26 - and then i'm going to say pip install
11:29 - slack clients like that
11:31 - and hopefully this should reinstall and
11:32 - everything should be working fine
11:34 - so that uninstall and reinstall actually
11:35 - works for me you can see i'm not getting
11:37 - that red squiggly line anymore
11:39 - and now slack should actually import
11:40 - properly so let me go ahead and run this
11:42 - and we can see that that actually worked
11:44 - there was no error which means that this
11:46 - is perfectly fine
11:47 - so the next thing that i will do is i
11:49 - will set this up so we actually send a
11:51 - message into the slack client
11:53 - but just or sorry slack workspace what
11:55 - am i saying but if you run this
11:56 - and no errors happen at all you're good
11:58 - you will see an error if your token is
12:01 - incorrect or if you can't
12:02 - connect to your slack web client
12:06 - so next what i'm going to do is i'm
12:07 - going to say client dot and this should
12:09 - be chat and then dot
12:11 - underscore post message and this is
12:13 - simply the method to actually post the
12:15 - message to the chat
12:16 - now the first thing that we need to pass
12:18 - in here is the channel that we want to
12:20 - post to
12:21 - so we're going to say channel equals and
12:23 - then we're going to do the pound sign
12:24 - for the name of the channel
12:25 - and then test or whatever other channel
12:27 - we have so in this case let's actually
12:29 - go
12:30 - back to our slack workspace
12:33 - and rather than just having this general
12:35 - channel here what i'm going to do is
12:36 - make a new channel so i'll create a new
12:38 - channel
12:38 - i'm just going to call this one test
12:40 - like that i will press
12:42 - create i don't need to add anyone into
12:44 - this right now
12:45 - but what i will do is connect an app so
12:47 - notice this is add people and connect an
12:49 - app
12:50 - so i have to add my youtube bot into
12:52 - this channel otherwise i'm gonna get an
12:54 - error so let's say connect an app
12:56 - and then we should see that we have
12:57 - youtube bot i will go ahead and i will
12:59 - add
13:00 - that in all right so now we have the
13:02 - youtube bot
13:03 - inside of this channel and we should be
13:05 - good to connect to it and send a message
13:07 - into it so i will leave this
13:09 - open i guess we'll go back to that in a
13:10 - second but we'll say channel equals test
13:12 - the name of the channel we just created
13:14 - and then text is going to be equal to
13:16 - whatever we want to send so in this case
13:17 - let's just say
13:18 - you know hello world exclamation point
13:22 - now what i can do is simply run this and
13:24 - we should see that we don't get any
13:26 - errors that's great and if i go back to
13:28 - my slack
13:29 - channel here we have our youtube bot
13:31 - saying hello
13:32 - world now let me just show you quickly
13:34 - what happens if i try to send something
13:36 - in the general channel
13:37 - when our bot is not added to that
13:39 - channel so let's say general
13:40 - like that and let's run this and notice
13:43 - that we get all kinds of text giving us
13:45 - an error
13:46 - if we look right here it says the server
13:48 - responded with okay
13:49 - false which means no this was not good
13:52 - error not
13:53 - in channel so it's telling us the bot is
13:54 - not inside of the channel so if you run
13:56 - into any errors
13:57 - just look at this last line here and see
13:59 - if you can kind of understand what was
14:00 - sent
14:01 - but that is pretty much all i wanted to
14:02 - show you for this video so i'll go back
14:04 - to test run this one more time
14:06 - to make sure that i haven't messed
14:08 - anything up and we can get we get hello
14:10 - world popping up one more time
14:12 - so obviously in the next few videos
14:13 - we're going to be doing a lot more
14:14 - advanced stuff
14:15 - this was just the basic setup i wanted
14:17 - to show you guys how we can configure
14:18 - everything
14:19 - and hopefully that's working for all of
14:21 - you so with that being said if you
14:22 - enjoyed make sure you leave a like
14:24 - subscribe to the channel and leave a
14:25 - comment letting me know what you want to
14:26 - see for the rest of this tutorial series

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on building a slack bot in python now i'll quickly introduce what slack is in case any of you are not aware but slack is just another messaging platform it's similar to something like discord maybe even comparable to something like microsoft teams i know a lot of large companies use slack for their main communication the nice thing with it is it's really easy to direct message people you can add teammates you have a bunch of different channels there's all kinds of emojis you can have some nice formatted messages i don't use slack all that often but a lot of you guys have been asking me to make a slack bot so i figured i would go ahead and make this tutorial series now in this series i'm going to be making kind of shorter videos aiming to have them about 10 to 15 minutes in length that show you kind of individual things so the first thing we're going to do in this video is just configure the slack bot which will actually take a good amount of time and then we'll actually add it into a channel and have it so it sends a message that will just show you the basics and the setup then from there what we'll do is we'll configure events so essentially allowing us to subscribe to specific events so if a user you know messages in a channel that will send us that message or send us an event that happened we can handle that event and then maybe we could reply to them we could track that message we can see if they send a command so on so forth we can do all kinds of stuff like that so you'll see what we're going to do later in the tutorial series but let's go ahead and get started the first thing we're going to need to do here is just make a new workspace so you can see right now i'm in the workspace i was using before i called it python api tutorial just the slack api i was just messing around before preparing for this tutorial but to create a new workspace you're going to have to obviously make an account on slack i'm going to assume you can figure out how to do that on your own and then if you're already in a workspace for some reason you can click on it and then click add workspace so i've already got that open here this is the page that will pop up when you press add workspace you need to insert an email i'll get my email to actually be blurred here i don't want you guys to see that and then i will click continue all right it's going to send me a confirmation code i'll go ahead and set this up and then once the workspace is ready i'll be right back all right so i went ahead and configured that i guess i'll just call this one slackbot tutorial i'll just label this one youtube so i can differentiate these two and now i have a new workspace i'm not going to add any teammates here let's skip that step and i guess we'll say hello team as our first message all right so here we are we are in our new workspace now what we're going to do is go ahead and head over to the slack api website all of the links here will be in the description you can find them down below and we're going to configure our first app so what i'm going to do is press on my app right here are your apps in the top corner you'll notice that i already have one right here your page may look a little bit different but all we're going to do is press create new app and go ahead and give it a name and then choose what workspace we want this to be in so i'm going to go ahead and name this one youtube bot like that and then i'll put this inside of slackbot tutorial for youtube all right so create app and now you can see we're on the kind of the dashboard here and we're gonna have to do is configure a bunch of different things so the first thing that we're going to do here is we're actually going to go ahead and go to bots like this and we're going to go to review scopes and add so essentially we need to give our bot permissions for whatever it's going to be doing in the channel so we can pick how many permissions we want it to have it can merely just read messages or it can send messages or it can add reactions or it can view email addresses and all kinds of different things like that so what we're going to do is go down here to add in oauth scope essentially the scopes are just the permissions that we have for our bot in whatever workspace we're in so here we can see there's a bunch of different scopes they have permissions for what they all do you obviously could add all of them if you wanted to but right now we only need one and we just need the chat and then right one so i need to find where that is uh chat chat chat come on where are you chat right is somewhere okay so i found it i just searched right here and then it popped up i have chat right okay so that's all we need this just allows us to send messages in a chat later on we will add other permissions and you'll see how we actually figure out which ones we need to add but for now that's all we need the next thing that we need to do is actually generate a token for our bot so to do that we first need to install this into our workspace and then i believe we can generate a token we're going to take that token copy that on our clipboard and then we'll add that to our actual python code which we'll start writing in a second so i'm going to say install app here we can say you know this is what it's allowed to do perform actions and channels and conversations we will allow that and there we go so now you can see we get a token for your workspace so i'm going to copy that token right here i will blur this out just so you guys don't see it and mess with my slack bot but just something to note here that if we add any more scopes we will need to reinstall this app into our workspace so if you mess with any of these scopes you're going to need to reinstall this i don't think the token will change when you do that but just keep in mind it will ask you to reinstall this in the workspace if you mess around with any of the scopes all right so now that we have that we're actually kind of good to go and we can head over to our python code so i'm in vs code right now this is the editor i'm going to use for this tutorial of course you guys can use whatever you want but i'm going to start by just making a new python file and calling this bot.pi you can call this whatever you want it does not need to be called bot.pi i'm also going to make another file here and i'm going to call this dot env now dot env is standing for our environment variable file so this is going to hold our token and a few other things that we'll need later on so that we can actually connect to our workspace and to our slack bot so the first thing i'm going to do in here is i'm going to say slack underscore token equals without a space and then i'm going to paste that token that i had from the slack api so go ahead and do that dot env so just period as the start you should see a little gear icon popping up if you're in vs code if you're not vs code that's totally fine just make sure these two files the python file and the env file are in the same directory then go ahead and save this file now what we're going to need to do next is install some python packages using pip so if you're not familiar with pip i actually don't know what it stands for i always call it uh package installer for python but i know that's not the correct name but anyways we need to go to our command prompt on our system if you are on mac in linux this is going to be a little bit different so i'll explain those steps in one second but start by just typing pip so p i p we type that and you should see some output popping up now this obviously assumes you have python installed on your system now for some reason pip is not working i have a video on my channel that explains how to install pygame so if you follow that what it will actually do is show you how to reconfigure your pip obviously when you get to the step where you're installing pi game rather than installing pi game install the module i'm about to show you here so if pip is working for you then what you're going to do if you're on windows in your command prompt is do pip install spell install correctly and then slack and spell slack correctly client this is what we're going to need to use to actually connect to our slack client so we'll just pip install slack clients now oops let me go back to command prompt here the next thing that we're going to need to do is install python hyphen dot env now what this is going to do is allow us to read from this environment variable file i just always like to use this module it makes things a lot easier so pip install python hyphen dot env make sure you add the python hyphen before all right so we're going to install that you can see that we're already satisfied for me but you guys should see some kind of loading bars and everything should be working now if you're on linux or you're on mac this will be the exact same steps except you're going to go to terminal and instead of pip you're going to type pip 3. so pip 3 should be the only difference here and if that doesn't work for you again i have another video that shows you how to reconfigure pip on mac so that works so i will leave that in the description as well and maybe put a card somewhere on the screen all right now that we have that what we're going to do is go inside of our bot.pi file and start writing some code so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to import slack next i'm going to import os which stands for operating system i believe and then we're going to import something from pathflip now pathlib is built into python 3 by default i will note right now that you need to use python 3.6 or above so you should already be using that version but you do need that so actually i'm going to say not import pathway but i'm going to say from pathlib import and then with a capital p path and then i'm going to say from oops if i can type correctly here from dot env import load underscore dot env what this is going to do is simply load our environment variable file so the first thing i'm going to do is say env underscore path which stands for our environment variable file path is equal to path and then i'm going to put a dot inside of a string here this stands for current directory then i'm going to add a slash and i'm going to do env with a period before it so this is just denoting where the path for our file is so that we can load it next we're going to say load.env and then we're going to say dot env underscore path equals env underscore path again just loading this environment variable file which will load the environment variable that we had inside of there next what we're going to do is we're going to say rtm client which is just the client that we're sorry not rtm client what am i saying this should be client is equal to slack dot web clients web client is what we're going to use for this tutorial there is some other clients built into slack here i'm not really going to talk about them it's just part of the slack api in this specific module in our case we're going to use the web client so we're going to say client equals slack dot web client and then we're going to say token equals os dot environ or however you say that and then inside of square brackets we're going to put the name of the environment variable that we had here so in this case i put slack token so i'm going to go ahead and put slack token inside of here and what this should do is load the actual value from this file and then kind of pass that in as our token so that is how we're going to store the token the reason i'm not just storing it in plain text here is because it's better practice to load this as an environment variable and say you had this on a github repository or something you would simply upload all of the code and you just wouldn't upload this environment variable file so that way no one knows what your token is so hopefully that makes sense all right so now we have client this should actually be working what we're going to do is go ahead and run this and see if this works all right so i got an annoying error here that's saying no module named slack now it's actually good that i ran into this because i wanted to cover this for you guys what happens here is that slack recently like the their api for it or the python package has been changed a bunch so if this doesn't work for you for some reason what you're going to need to do is simply uninstall slack so pip uninstall slack clients like that and then just simply reinstall it afterwards so in this case i'm going to say yes we will remove all of that and then i'm going to say pip install slack clients like that and hopefully this should reinstall and everything should be working fine so that uninstall and reinstall actually works for me you can see i'm not getting that red squiggly line anymore and now slack should actually import properly so let me go ahead and run this and we can see that that actually worked there was no error which means that this is perfectly fine so the next thing that i will do is i will set this up so we actually send a message into the slack client but just or sorry slack workspace what am i saying but if you run this and no errors happen at all you're good you will see an error if your token is incorrect or if you can't connect to your slack web client so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to say client dot and this should be chat and then dot underscore post message and this is simply the method to actually post the message to the chat now the first thing that we need to pass in here is the channel that we want to post to so we're going to say channel equals and then we're going to do the pound sign for the name of the channel and then test or whatever other channel we have so in this case let's actually go back to our slack workspace and rather than just having this general channel here what i'm going to do is make a new channel so i'll create a new channel i'm just going to call this one test like that i will press create i don't need to add anyone into this right now but what i will do is connect an app so notice this is add people and connect an app so i have to add my youtube bot into this channel otherwise i'm gonna get an error so let's say connect an app and then we should see that we have youtube bot i will go ahead and i will add that in all right so now we have the youtube bot inside of this channel and we should be good to connect to it and send a message into it so i will leave this open i guess we'll go back to that in a second but we'll say channel equals test the name of the channel we just created and then text is going to be equal to whatever we want to send so in this case let's just say you know hello world exclamation point now what i can do is simply run this and we should see that we don't get any errors that's great and if i go back to my slack channel here we have our youtube bot saying hello world now let me just show you quickly what happens if i try to send something in the general channel when our bot is not added to that channel so let's say general like that and let's run this and notice that we get all kinds of text giving us an error if we look right here it says the server responded with okay false which means no this was not good error not in channel so it's telling us the bot is not inside of the channel so if you run into any errors just look at this last line here and see if you can kind of understand what was sent but that is pretty much all i wanted to show you for this video so i'll go back to test run this one more time to make sure that i haven't messed anything up and we can get we get hello world popping up one more time so obviously in the next few videos we're going to be doing a lot more advanced stuff this was just the basic setup i wanted to show you guys how we can configure everything and hopefully that's working for all of you so with that being said if you enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and leave a comment letting me know what you want to see for the rest of this tutorial series
