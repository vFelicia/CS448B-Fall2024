00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to their
00:01 - Python quick tips in today's video we're
00:03 - gonna be going over the enumerate
00:04 - keyword slash function and what that
00:06 - does in terms of its using a for loop
00:08 - now what I want to do is just introduce
00:10 - a problem here that a numerate can solve
00:12 - for us so essentially let's say we have
00:13 - a list here like apples pears oranges
00:15 - fruits we want to loop through the list
00:17 - and we want to get the elements in our
00:18 - list as well as the index of those
00:20 - elements very common problem you need to
00:22 - do this for tons of different exercises
00:24 - and I'm sure you guys have created a
00:26 - solution like I'm about to introduce
00:27 - here so one way that we might do this
00:29 - without the use of enumerate is for
00:31 - element in my list which means we're
00:32 - gonna loop through apples pears oranges
00:34 - fruits all the elements but not the
00:36 - indexes we'll print that element out and
00:38 - then maybe we're gonna also check for a
00:40 - certain index to occur so we say if it's
00:43 - index 1 which essentially means whatever
00:45 - the second element is let's print the
00:47 - count is 1 that's just something I want
00:49 - to do and then we have this other
00:50 - variable outside of our for loop that's
00:52 - defined and we count and keep track of
00:54 - what index were on by doing that so
00:56 - essentially this count is outside it
00:58 - keeps track of what number we are on in
01:00 - the list and then we can look at that
01:02 - and do something accordingly since we
01:03 - already have the element we can just
01:05 - print that out by doing element but this
01:07 - is really not like the best way to do
01:09 - this now another way that we could do
01:10 - this is like this we can say for X in
01:13 - range the length of my list so rather
01:14 - than looping through the elements will
01:15 - loop through the indexes in our list and
01:17 - then we say print my list X which is
01:20 - going to be the element because we're
01:21 - accessing the element at index X then we
01:23 - say if x equals equal to 1 which means
01:25 - it or at the second element or the first
01:27 - index of our list we'll print X is 1 now
01:29 - these are fine these work but I'm gonna
01:31 - show you a more elegant solution up here
01:33 - that's much better so what you can
01:35 - actually do is use an enumerate keyword
01:36 - which allows you to loop through not
01:38 - only the index but the element as well
01:40 - so we can say for x element in enumerate
01:45 - and then we put my underscore list like
01:47 - this and now I'll just show you what we
01:49 - actually do here we can print X element
01:51 - and I'll show you what this looks like
01:53 - so I'm gonna erase these so that we
01:54 - don't see these and let's run this and
01:57 - what we get is 0 apples 1 pears 2
02:00 - oranges 3 fruits
02:02 - essentially X lines up with the index of
02:05 - the element and we're able to access
02:06 - both X which is gonna be our index and
02:08 - the element by simply doing this
02:10 - XCOM element really nice super simple
02:13 - and this is what a numerate does I use
02:15 - it like hundreds of times a day when I'm
02:17 - writing code it definitely does save you
02:19 - a bit of time and just make your code
02:20 - look a little bit cleaner now if we
02:22 - wanted to duplicate the other example
02:23 - that we had what we could do is just
02:25 - print elements then we can say if x
02:27 - equals equals one print X is one like
02:33 - that guy believed I had a capital X here
02:35 - so to do that okay so if we run that we
02:37 - get the same thing apples pears X's want
02:39 - oranges fruits and there we go that is
02:42 - how enumerate works hopefully this
02:44 - helped you guys out a bit if you have
02:44 - any questions feel free to leave them
02:46 - down below and as always let me know if
02:47 - you want to see any other things in
