00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in this
00:02 - video I'm gonna be talking about why it
00:03 - may not be the best idea to be using an
00:05 - IDE that being said IDs are a great tool
00:08 - but if you're a beginner and especially
00:10 - a student and you're using an IDE you
00:12 - may be hindering your programming
00:14 - ability and maybe even your ability to
00:15 - get a job so make sure you listen to why
00:17 - you might not want to be using it so if
00:26 - you guys are interested in possibly
00:27 - winning one Bitcoin by creating your own
00:29 - game written in Python Pi game or some
00:32 - other language I encourage you check out
00:34 - the link in the description and have a
00:35 - look at this website that's running a
00:37 - contest called game Chan game jam so
00:39 - this contest runs until April 18th so
00:42 - you've got about a month left to enter
00:43 - and the best game is gonna win one
00:45 - Bitcoin all the details about the game
00:47 - how you enter how your judge are on the
00:49 - website but I figured I shout out to you
00:50 - guys because I know a lot of you're
00:51 - interested in Python and PI game and
00:53 - this could look great on a resume to say
00:54 - you've entered in a contest like this
00:56 - and you submitted a game ok so before I
00:58 - get too far into this content let me
01:00 - just quickly say that I have nothing
01:01 - against IDE s I love IDE s and
01:04 - personally I use one almost every day
01:06 - now the reason that I'm recommending
01:08 - recommending you don't use one is if
01:10 - you're not an experienced programmer or
01:12 - you're just learning a language these
01:15 - are the reasons this is one you wouldn't
01:17 - want to be using an IDE if you're
01:19 - experienced your developer you've been
01:21 - programming for many years IDs are
01:23 - amazing and you're probably like why in
01:24 - the world wouldn't I use one and you're
01:26 - absolutely correct but if you're a
01:27 - beginner using an IDE can really affect
01:30 - you and really hurt you and that's what
01:31 - I'm gonna be really mentioning in this
01:32 - video now the first reason I would say
01:35 - not to use an IDE is if you're an
01:37 - absolute beginner and you're trying to
01:39 - learn programming using an IDE is going
01:41 - to affect you in two ways first of all
01:43 - it's gonna be difficult to use IDs are
01:45 - typically not easy and you have to
01:47 - actually learn them so learning not only
01:49 - how to program but now how to use your
01:51 - IDE are just two things you don't need
01:53 - on your plate at the same time the
01:55 - second reason and I would say this is a
01:57 - lot more powerful than having to learn
01:58 - the IDE is the fact that it's gonna help
02:01 - you in so many different ways that's not
02:03 - good for you for example if you run into
02:06 - some errors rather than testing your
02:08 - programming seeing the crash output it's
02:10 - gonna tell you exactly what the error is
02:11 - it's
02:12 - say this won't work and it's also gonna
02:14 - autocorrect lines so what that means is
02:16 - you're not really gonna be learning
02:18 - exactly what you're doing wrong and I
02:20 - had this issue when I started
02:21 - programming a job I started using
02:23 - Eclipse and I would never have failed
02:25 - outputs when I ran them because it would
02:27 - constantly be telling me no you can't
02:29 - run this you have to fix this and it
02:31 - would autocorrect my lines so I realized
02:33 - I was forgetting a lot of syntax and if
02:35 - I had to use if I didn't have that IDE
02:37 - available and I had to write and like
02:39 - notepad plus plus or even by hand I
02:41 - couldn't remember a lot of the reasons
02:43 - why things were crash or just the syntax
02:45 - in general and that's one of the reasons
02:47 - you might not want to use one because if
02:48 - you're just learning it's gonna help you
02:50 - almost too much you want to run into
02:52 - those mistakes and you want to learn the
02:54 - syntax by yourself you don't want to
02:55 - constantly have that aid of the IDE
02:58 - helping you through the way and this is
03:00 - what a lot of professors and teachers
03:01 - says well using IDs as a beginner is
03:04 - just not the best way to learn once you
03:06 - get more advanced that's fine but if
03:09 - you're just trying to learn the language
03:09 - an IDE is really gonna do more harm than
03:12 - is good now the second reason I would
03:15 - say not to use an IDE is similar to this
03:17 - and it's if you're a student now you're
03:19 - gonna be like well it can help my
03:21 - efficiency
03:21 - I like IDE s I can code faster with them
03:24 - that's fine that's a valid reason to use
03:26 - one but if you're gonna have to be
03:28 - writing code by hand you better make
03:30 - sure that you know the language you're
03:32 - writing it and this is an issue that I
03:33 - see a lot of my classmates having they
03:36 - code with IDs because it's way easier
03:38 - but then when they get to a handwritten
03:39 - test
03:40 - and yes we have to hand write code in
03:41 - university I know it's not 1990 um they
03:45 - have a lot of issues and that's because
03:46 - they can't remember the exact syntax or
03:48 - their IDE would automatically finish a
03:50 - line or it would add a semicolon or it
03:52 - would fix the brackets for them but they
03:54 - don't have that luxury when they're
03:55 - writing by hand
03:56 - right so that's one of the reasons you
03:58 - may not want to use one as well is if
04:00 - you're a student and you really need to
04:01 - know that language down because you
04:03 - can't look it up on a test and you're
04:04 - gonna have to handwrite I'd recommend at
04:06 - least before the test
04:07 - you're either practicing by hand or
04:09 - you're just using a simple text editor
04:11 - third reason you might not want to use
04:12 - an IDE your computer simply can't handle
04:15 - it now I know most IDs and computers and
04:18 - today is age run fine and aren't going
04:20 - to be laggy but if you're using a very
04:22 - mad
04:23 - very heavy and system heavy IDE you
04:25 - might not have the luxury of being able
04:27 - to use that on every machine and going
04:29 - from using an IDE to not using an IDE on
04:32 - a different machine can be a lot more
04:34 - difficult than it looks this is
04:36 - personally why whenever I write Java
04:38 - code I write it in sublime text I don't
04:40 - use an IDE because I never know when I'm
04:43 - gonna want to write Java code or if I'm
04:45 - gonna have to do it if I want to load up
04:46 - for example on my laptop Eclipse and all
04:50 - this stuff I'd rather just quickly write
04:52 - it in a text editor and that's just
04:54 - personally my opinion a reason for why
04:56 - you may not want to use an IDE now I
04:59 - kind of mentioned this at the beginning
05:00 - of video and I said it might affect you
05:01 - getting a job now this kind of wraps up
05:04 - all of the three reasons before in a job
05:06 - interview typically for coding they're
05:08 - very tough and they actually ask you to
05:10 - write code or to explain code in the
05:13 - interview now if you need to write code
05:15 - in the interview typically they're
05:17 - lenient on syntax but you don't want to
05:19 - be in the position where you can't
05:21 - remember certain syntax or certain
05:24 - errors are automatically fixed for you
05:25 - because you've been using an IDE and you
05:27 - don't remember them in the interview now
05:29 - I know this is kind of a weird thing and
05:32 - a lot of people are probably gonna say
05:32 - oh no like I'd be fine but actually try
05:35 - writing your code in a text editor like
05:37 - sublime text or notepad plus plus or
05:40 - even just notepad and tab yourself and
05:42 - see how well you do see if you can
05:44 - remember all the lines see if you know
05:46 - all the syntax because that's something
05:48 - important and once you get that down
05:50 - it's fine to use an IDE because you
05:52 - already know the stuff it's just aiding
05:54 - you with it but if you don't know it and
05:56 - you're using the IDE then you're kind of
05:58 - just hindering yourself so make sure
06:00 - that you guys know the language and you
06:02 - know what you're doing before you
06:03 - possibly go to a job interview or go
06:06 - write a test and all you've been using
06:08 - is an IDE so I'm gonna wrap it with the
06:10 - video now I know a lot of you probably
06:12 - have mixed opinions on this and that
06:13 - you'd rather use an IDE and that's what
06:15 - you've been using but seriously please
06:17 - consider actually writing your code in a
06:19 - text editor and then using an IDE if you
06:21 - guys are advanced ignore everything I've
06:23 - said but if you're a beginner and you're
06:24 - just learning or maybe even an
06:25 - intermediate consider writing your code
06:27 - in just a standard text editor see how
06:30 - you do with that and if you're fine then
06:31 - you can move up to an IDE that's been it
06:33 - for today guys if you enjoyed the video
06:35 - please make sure you leave a like and
06:36 - subscribe
06:37 - and I will see you again in another
06:38 - video

hey guys and welcome back so in this video I'm gonna be talking about why it may not be the best idea to be using an IDE that being said IDs are a great tool but if you're a beginner and especially a

are interested in possibly winning one Bitcoin by creating your own game written in Python Pi game or some other language I encourage you check out the link in the description and have a look at this website that's running a contest called game Chan game jam so this contest runs until April 18th so you've got about a month left to enter and the best game is gonna win one Bitcoin all the details about the game how you enter how your judge are on the website but I figured I shout out to you guys because I know a lot of you're interested in Python and PI game and this could look great on a resume to say you've entered in a contest like this and you submitted a game ok so before I get too far into this content let me just quickly say that I have nothing against IDE s I love IDE s and
