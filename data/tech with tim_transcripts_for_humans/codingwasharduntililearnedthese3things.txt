00:00 - I guarantee you that until you learn
00:02 - these three things you will struggle to
00:04 - write code fortunately once you learn
00:06 - them coding will genuinely seem
00:08 - effortless now the first of these three
00:11 - things is syntax and program structure
00:14 - you need to understand how your language
00:15 - works you need to have the fundamentals
00:17 - down you need to know how to write basic
00:19 - code and essentially to have all of the
00:21 - tools in the language you need to be
00:23 - able to solve a specific problem now
00:25 - many of you already know how to do that
00:26 - it's relatively easy to learn these
00:28 - skills in just a few weeks for example
00:30 - pick up functions pick of if statements
00:32 - variables you guys know what I'm talking
00:33 - about here and I'm sure you followed
00:35 - many online tutorials or even premium
00:37 - courses like my brand new software
00:39 - development course which I'll leave a
00:40 - link to in the description now once you
00:42 - learn syntax where many of you will
00:44 - struggle and kind of get stuck is
00:46 - program structure now what I'm talking
00:48 - about here is once you know a language
00:50 - and you know how to write basic code
00:52 - really what you're good at doing is
00:54 - solving small problems with those tools
00:57 - that you have where it becomes more
00:58 - difficult is when you want to take take
01:00 - on a larger task that's not well defined
01:02 - for example you want to build a website
01:03 - you want to build an entire project from
01:05 - scratch you want to make a game you want
01:07 - to do something that goes beyond those
01:09 - well-defined and small discrete tasks to
01:11 - something a bit more large and Abstract
01:14 - this is where many people fall apart
01:16 - because it requires knowledge of how to
01:18 - structure your code where to place
01:20 - different components and how to go about
01:22 - things systematically what I mean by
01:24 - this is where do you put the Imports
01:26 - where do you put all of the variables
01:28 - where do you put the different functions
01:29 - or classes how do these components
01:31 - interact with each other and how do I
01:33 - lay them out in a way that's
01:34 - maintainable and easy to understand now
01:37 - I can't teach you that in this short
01:39 - video but what I can recommend you do is
01:41 - follow along with other experienced
01:43 - programmers through some larger projects
01:45 - so you get a better idea of how you
01:47 - structure code again this is a skill
01:50 - that you need to learn to get beyond
01:51 - that intermediate programming level
01:54 - where do I put the different pieces of
01:55 - my code how do they interact with each
01:57 - other how do I keep it clean and
01:59 - organized and how do I know kind of what
02:01 - part of the code to write at a time
02:04 - again the best way I can recommend you
02:05 - learn that is by following along with
02:07 - for example free tutorials on YouTube
02:09 - where they build an entire project I
02:11 - have many of those on my channel even
02:13 - going to some GitHub repositories and
02:15 - viewing code that is written by
02:17 - experienced programmers you could for
02:18 - example check out my GitHub repository
02:21 - or you could of course join some more
02:22 - premium courses like my software
02:24 - development course which I'll leave a
02:25 - link to in the description that has an
02:27 - entire section specifically on structure
02:29 - in code and writing it in a clean
02:31 - organized manner now the next thing you
02:34 - need to look at is debugging if you can
02:36 - be a good debugger effective and not get
02:38 - frustrated when you run into an issue
02:40 - you're really going to see yourself
02:41 - Advance a lot as a developer or a
02:44 - programmer and you're going to be able
02:45 - to make a lot more progress a lot faster
02:47 - many people especially beginner
02:49 - programmers really get discouraged when
02:51 - they run into issues or bugs and they
02:53 - don't know the correct way to approach
02:55 - them and it causes Mass frustration
02:57 - depression demotivation things that
02:59 - we've probably all experienced before
03:01 - that can really hold you back and make
03:03 - it feel like coding is impossible now I
03:05 - want to share with you a few small
03:07 - pieces of advice that can make debugging
03:09 - easier for you first when you are
03:11 - debugging the mindset you should adopt
03:13 - is what you were really trying to do is
03:16 - isolate the problem to the smallest area
03:19 - of the code you possibly can now this is
03:21 - much easier said than done but the way
03:23 - you should attempt to solve bugs is to
03:26 - reduce the amount of possible things
03:28 - that could be impacting your program now
03:30 - it's hard to give you a specific example
03:32 - of this but what you really want to do
03:34 - here is try to disable as many things as
03:37 - possible in the code so you can narrow
03:39 - down where exactly you're running into a
03:42 - specific issue so let's say you have
03:44 - some form and there's an issue
03:45 - submitting the form now there's a lot of
03:48 - things that could be causing this
03:49 - problem right it could be a UI related
03:51 - problem it could be a backend related
03:52 - problem it could be something in the
03:54 - JavaScript code it could be in the front
03:55 - end in the HTML there's a bunch of
03:57 - different areas so immediately you want
03:59 - to start isolating what area that would
04:02 - be in right so you'd want to First go
04:04 - for example and maybe check the back end
04:06 - and say okay let me look at this in
04:07 - isolation when it's not attached to this
04:09 - form and see if this works as I
04:12 - anticipate it working now if that does
04:14 - work you've just crossed off a whole
04:16 - large section of code that you don't
04:18 - need to look at for the potential issue
04:20 - now maybe you go into the JavaScript
04:22 - code and you say okay let's check to
04:23 - make sure I'm collecting the form
04:25 - elements properly okay it looks like I
04:27 - am actually getting all of the correct
04:28 - data inside of here this specific area
04:31 - of the code is working hopefully you get
04:33 - what I'm saying here you're going to go
04:34 - through all of the different things that
04:35 - could be causing the problem check them
04:38 - off one by one and isolate it to the
04:40 - smallest possible area you can where
04:43 - then you can start going through the
04:44 - code line by line and seeing exactly
04:46 - what's going wrong it's impossible to
04:48 - analyze you know thousands upon
04:50 - thousands of lines of code you need to
04:52 - First cross off as many areas as you can
04:55 - isolate and get into the smallest part
04:58 - and then you can go through and do a
04:59 - more thorough dissection of where the
05:01 - actual bug lies now to be able to do
05:03 - this it's going to be helpful to know
05:04 - how to use professional debugging tools
05:06 - like the debugger that might exist
05:08 - inside of something like VSS code so I
05:10 - recommend spend 15 or 20 minutes learn
05:13 - how to use the debugger I promise you
05:15 - it's not actually that complicated and
05:16 - it can help you a lot to do what I just
05:18 - said isolate the problem now beyond that
05:21 - once you figure out where relatively the
05:24 - problem is you can use something known
05:26 - as the rubber ducky technique now this
05:28 - isn't something I person use all the
05:30 - time but I know it's very helpful
05:32 - especially to beginner programmers what
05:34 - you want to do is go through line by
05:36 - line in a smallish area right it's like
05:38 - a function or a class body or where you
05:41 - know the bug exists and you want to
05:43 - imagine that you're explaining line by
05:46 - line what's happening to a rubber ducky
05:48 - so some people actually have a rubber
05:49 - ducky on their desk that they do this
05:51 - with it could be any object you don't
05:52 - need to have some object in front of you
05:54 - but verbally out loud talk through each
05:57 - line that you have in your code and
05:59 - explain what it does now what this does
06:02 - is force you to actually analyze each
06:04 - line understand what it's doing and a
06:06 - lot of times when you have to explain
06:08 - something to someone else you'll see
06:10 - immediately what's actually causing the
06:12 - issue I know this happens to me all the
06:14 - time I'm explaining something maybe even
06:16 - in a tutorial and I start explaining I'm
06:18 - like wait that doesn't make any sense at
06:20 - all but I only realized that because I
06:22 - actually had to say it verbally and I
06:24 - couldn't skip over it in my mind I had
06:26 - to go through it very detailed now once
06:28 - you've learned all that the next thing
06:30 - that's really going to help you get
06:31 - better at programming is understanding
06:33 - how to plan before you code now one
06:36 - thing that I've been planning for a very
06:38 - long time is actually my new software
06:40 - development course in collaboration with
06:42 - course careers now the way this course
06:44 - works is you go through a software
06:45 - development fundamentals course which is
06:47 - taught by me and then you pick a
06:49 - specialization in frontend devops or
06:51 - backend taught by an industry expert
06:54 - like webdev simplified who actually
06:56 - teaches the front-end specialization now
06:58 - this course is kind of different than
07:00 - other courses that I've done before
07:01 - because we actually have a network of
07:03 - employers that are ready to hire and
07:05 - interview the top students coming out of
07:07 - the program not only do we have quizzes
07:10 - practice questions we actually have a
07:12 - proctored final exam and we really give
07:14 - you a real evaluation so you understand
07:17 - if your career ready we give you
07:19 - coaching one-on-one support a Discord
07:21 - server with a massive community and
07:22 - direct access to myself and a ton of
07:25 - other benefits that I really know a lot
07:26 - of you guys will find some value from so
07:28 - if you're interested check it out from
07:29 - the link in the description we do
07:31 - actually have a free introduction course
07:33 - which teaches you everything you need to
07:34 - do to break into software development so
07:37 - even if you don't purchase the course
07:38 - you can go through that free course and
07:40 - get a ton of value just sign up for free
07:42 - from the link in the description all
07:44 - right so let's get into planning now the
07:45 - basic idea here is that coding is
07:48 - already hard writing code and solving
07:50 - small problems is already a difficult
07:52 - thing to do what makes it significantly
07:54 - more difficult is when you need to break
07:56 - a task down into smaller tasks and
07:58 - figure out what you're going to be doing
08:00 - while you're writing code which is
08:01 - actually the way most people end up
08:03 - doing things what you should be doing
08:05 - instead is spending a bit of time before
08:07 - you write any code and breaking your
08:10 - problem down into smaller problems and
08:12 - eventually very small tasks that are
08:14 - discret and easy to understand and that
08:16 - you can Implement one at a time ideally
08:19 - before you get into any code you have a
08:21 - list of tasks these tasks are in an
08:23 - order and you know okay I need to do
08:25 - this first then I'm going to do this
08:27 - then I'm going to do this and these
08:29 - individual things are a lot easier for
08:31 - your mind to understand and a lot easier
08:33 - for you to actually code Out imagine
08:35 - coding three or four functions where you
08:38 - know exactly what each function needs to
08:39 - do versus coding an entire project that
08:42 - involves those four functions right
08:43 - since you spent a bit of time beforehand
08:45 - breaking down what it is you needed to
08:47 - write you now have a much easier task to
08:50 - solve rather than trying to solve this
08:51 - huge task all at once okay that's the
08:54 - basic idea and we call this problem
08:56 - decomposition breaking the problem down
08:59 - into smaller tasks that are easier to
09:01 - understand and ultimately easier for you
09:02 - to solve I guarantee you that The
09:04 - Upfront investment of time is actually
09:06 - going to save you a lot of time and make
09:08 - you much more efficient when you are
09:10 - writing code now Beyond this when you
09:12 - are planning especially if you're
09:13 - working on a slightly larger project
09:16 - it's important to do a little bit of
09:17 - research a lot of times the problem
09:19 - you're trying to solve has actually
09:21 - already been solved so you don't need to
09:23 - reinvent the wheel or try to come up
09:24 - with some genius solution you can just
09:27 - go online and you can look up exactly it
09:29 - is that you're trying to do you can read
09:31 - stack Overflow forums you can read
09:33 - documentation you can read articles or
09:35 - research papers and you can come up with
09:37 - a general idea of what it is that you
09:39 - need to do from what other people have
09:41 - done in the past and this is what I do a
09:43 - lot especially now when I'm trying to
09:45 - solve more complex problems you also can
09:47 - go to chat GPT you can type in exactly
09:50 - the problem you're trying to solve and
09:52 - it will often times give you a highlevel
09:54 - overview of the different types of
09:55 - solutions you can use and then you can
09:57 - pick one and adjusted to your needs so
10:00 - it's always important do a little bit of
10:02 - research and just Googling for a few
10:03 - minutes could genuinely save you a
10:05 - massive amount of time and you can even
10:07 - find there's a library that does this
10:08 - there's a framework that's already built
10:10 - and you now don't need to go build the
10:12 - thing you were planning on building
10:13 - beforehand anyways I think with that
10:15 - said guys I'm going to wrap up the video
10:16 - here I hope you found this helpful and I
10:19 - know that these three things were really
10:20 - what helped me get better at programming
10:23 - and feel confident to write pretty much
10:25 - any type of code any project and solve
10:27 - any kind of problem I hope that they
10:29 - will help you do the same and I look
10:30 - forward to seeing you in another YouTube
10:34 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

I guarantee you that until you learn these three things you will struggle to write code fortunately once you learn them coding will genuinely seem effortless now the first of these three things is syntax and program structure you need to understand how your language works you need to have the fundamentals down you need to know how to write basic code and essentially to have all of the tools in the language you need to be able to solve a specific problem now many of you already know how to do that it's relatively easy to learn these skills in just a few weeks for example pick up functions pick of if statements variables you guys know what I'm talking about here and I'm sure you followed many online tutorials or even premium courses like my brand new software development course which I'll leave a link to in the description now once you learn syntax where many of you will struggle and kind of get stuck is program structure now what I'm talking about here is once you know a language and you know how to write basic code really what you're good at doing is solving small problems with those tools that you have where it becomes more difficult is when you want to take take on a larger task that's not well defined for example you want to build a website you want to build an entire project from scratch you want to make a game you want to do something that goes beyond those welldefined and small discrete tasks to something a bit more large and Abstract this is where many people fall apart because it requires knowledge of how to structure your code where to place different components and how to go about things systematically what I mean by this is where do you put the Imports where do you put all of the variables where do you put the different functions or classes how do these components interact with each other and how do I lay them out in a way that's maintainable and easy to understand now I can't teach you that in this short video but what I can recommend you do is follow along with other experienced programmers through some larger projects so you get a better idea of how you structure code again this is a skill that you need to learn to get beyond that intermediate programming level where do I put the different pieces of my code how do they interact with each other how do I keep it clean and organized and how do I know kind of what part of the code to write at a time again the best way I can recommend you learn that is by following along with for example free tutorials on YouTube where they build an entire project I have many of those on my channel even going to some GitHub repositories and viewing code that is written by experienced programmers you could for example check out my GitHub repository or you could of course join some more premium courses like my software development course which I'll leave a link to in the description that has an entire section specifically on structure in code and writing it in a clean organized manner now the next thing you need to look at is debugging if you can be a good debugger effective and not get frustrated when you run into an issue you're really going to see yourself Advance a lot as a developer or a programmer and you're going to be able to make a lot more progress a lot faster many people especially beginner programmers really get discouraged when they run into issues or bugs and they don't know the correct way to approach them and it causes Mass frustration depression demotivation things that we've probably all experienced before that can really hold you
