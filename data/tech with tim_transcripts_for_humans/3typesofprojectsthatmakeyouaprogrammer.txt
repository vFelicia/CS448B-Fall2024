00:00 - if you want to be a competent developer
00:02 - you need to work on projects but not
00:04 - just any projects ones that actually
00:06 - give you the skills that make you stand
00:07 - out as a developer that's why in this
00:10 - video I'll share with you three types of
00:12 - projects that are guaranteed to make you
00:14 - a
00:16 - [Music]
00:18 - programmer now the first type of project
00:20 - that you need to build is something that
00:22 - you have no idea how to build that's
00:24 - right you need to pick an idea up that
00:26 - seems so incredibly difficult so far out
00:29 - there so forign something that you
00:30 - genuinely don't even know how to begin
00:32 - I'm talking about projects where you
00:34 - might not even know the programming
00:35 - language you're going to use you don't
00:37 - know the framework you don't know the
00:38 - IDE you'll be using what operating
00:40 - system it's going to run on something
00:41 - that is so foreign and so out there
00:43 - where you genuinely have to start right
00:45 - from the beginning pretty much as a
00:47 - beginner now the nice thing is you still
00:49 - have your programming knowledge and a
00:51 - lot of what you know is going to carry
00:52 - over into that project however when you
00:55 - start a project you have no idea how to
00:57 - build you have to learn a ton and you
00:59 - have to figure figure out how to learn
01:00 - as efficiently as possible so right when
01:02 - you learn something you can apply it
01:04 - into the project I find the times I
01:07 - learn the fastest and the best or where
01:09 - I have something I need to build and I
01:11 - don't know how to do it that forces me
01:13 - to be resourceful go out there learn a
01:15 - new skill and pick up only the
01:17 - information I actually need to
01:19 - immediately apply it in the project this
01:21 - is a massive skill and that's why I want
01:22 - you to build this type of project now
01:24 - what this will also do is help you build
01:26 - your confidence being able to finish a
01:28 - project that you genuin had no idea how
01:31 - to build when you started is going to
01:32 - allow you to realize hey I'm a
01:34 - programmer I'm not just a python
01:36 - developer or a JavaScript developer I'm
01:38 - a programmer I'm someone who can write
01:40 - code in any language any framework and I
01:42 - can figure it out it might take me a
01:44 - little bit longer but now that I've done
01:45 - it with this project I feel confident to
01:47 - do it with any type of project those are
01:49 - the best programmers ones that are
01:51 - experienced in multiple languages
01:53 - multiple Frameworks and have the
01:54 - confidence to know that their skill set
01:56 - can be applied in pretty much any domain
01:58 - any role any application doesn't matter
02:01 - what it is now that's exactly why in my
02:03 - software development course which you
02:05 - can check out from the link in the
02:06 - description we teach you multiple
02:08 - programming languages and actually get
02:09 - you to specialize in a specific area of
02:12 - development so you realize that you can
02:13 - be good at JavaScript go and then you
02:16 - can go and learn devops then you can
02:17 - learn backend then you can learn front
02:19 - end you're flexible Dynamic and you're
02:21 - someone who really stands out as a
02:23 - junior developer if you guys are
02:24 - interested in that course check it out
02:26 - from the link in the description we have
02:27 - an entire network of employers that are
02:29 - ready to interview the top students
02:31 - graduating from the program we've
02:33 - already had a few people that have
02:34 - finished the final exams and are just
02:36 - getting to that phase right now anyways
02:38 - I'll give you an example of an app that
02:40 - I built when I was younger that did
02:41 - pretty much exactly what I described now
02:43 - when I was in grade 11 I had only ever
02:45 - written code in Python I was actually
02:47 - pretty good at development already but I
02:49 - had really no experience outside of
02:51 - python and a little bit of c and some
02:53 - basic web development now I had a
02:55 - problem I always had to walk every day
02:57 - from school to home it was about a 30-
02:59 - minute walk and I constantly had to
03:00 - carry these super heavy textbooks that
03:02 - were like 20 30 pounds in my backpack
03:04 - and it really kind of took a toll on me
03:06 - so what I would do instead is take
03:08 - photos of the textbook pages I needed
03:10 - and just look at them at home the issue
03:11 - was by the time I did this the 50th 60th
03:14 - day I had hundreds of photos in my
03:15 - camera roll and it was pretty difficult
03:17 - to actually locate the pages that I
03:19 - needed so what I wanted to do was make
03:21 - an iPhone app that I could have on my
03:22 - phone that could just organize all of
03:24 - these photos for me and kind of keep a
03:25 - log of all of my textbook pages homework
03:28 - assignments questions I needed to do Etc
03:31 - now I had no idea how to build this so I
03:33 - actually had to start building an IOS
03:35 - app and I didn't even know what IDE to
03:37 - use what framework I needed what
03:38 - language I was going to write in so I
03:40 - ended up learning Swift learning xcode
03:43 - building a UI learning all of the
03:45 - intricacies of iOS development and in
03:47 - about a month I was able to make this
03:48 - app now this was really the first time
03:50 - in my life that I gained that confidence
03:52 - to feel like hey I just went from having
03:55 - no experience how to do this to building
03:56 - a full-fledged IOS app in about a month
03:59 - what does that mean I can do in the
04:00 - future that means I can learn any
04:02 - language that means I can learn any
04:03 - framework and it really made me feel
04:05 - like much more of a programmer and not
04:07 - just a python developer so I encourage
04:10 - you to build similar things like that
04:12 - especially if they help you in your real
04:13 - world life those are some of the best
04:15 - projects where again you constantly have
04:17 - to find exactly the information you need
04:19 - apply that immediately and continue that
04:22 - process until you finish the
04:24 - [Music]
04:26 - project now the second project you need
04:29 - to build if you want to be a programmer
04:31 - is something that has real users now
04:33 - this doesn't need to be millions of
04:35 - users or hundreds of thousands of users
04:37 - or even tens of users it could be two
04:39 - users it could be three users it could
04:40 - be your mom it could be your brother it
04:42 - could be you who's using the application
04:44 - but it's so important to actually build
04:46 - something that's used by real people
04:48 - that's because people interact with an
04:50 - application a lot different than you
04:52 - think and often times it's very
04:54 - difficult to actually imagine how
04:56 - someone's going to use the code that
04:57 - you've written and it makes you think
04:59 - about about things in a very different
05:00 - perspective when you have real people
05:02 - using your application giving you
05:04 - feedback you need to think about things
05:06 - in a very different way first of all is
05:08 - what I'm building actually helping the
05:10 - user is it just cool for me or is it
05:12 - something that's actually going to be
05:13 - useful and worth their time second of
05:16 - all how easy is it for the user to use
05:18 - this feature can they understand it is
05:20 - it intuitive do they need instructions
05:22 - it just gives you a very different
05:24 - mindset on things and it forces you to
05:26 - be almost a product manager while an
05:28 - engineer at the same time which I think
05:30 - is a really valuable skill at the same
05:32 - time you need ways to track your users
05:35 - analytics you need to figure out if bugs
05:36 - are occurring or errors are occurring
05:38 - you need way to capture feedback and you
05:40 - need to design with the user in mind so
05:42 - I would encourage you pick some type of
05:45 - application that real people are
05:46 - actually going to use I'll give you an
05:48 - example of one that I made my friends
05:50 - and I would constantly complain about
05:52 - who was on aux Ox meaning controlling
05:54 - the music and all of my friends pretty
05:56 - much use Spotify so I actually coded a
05:59 - solution that was going to be used by
06:00 - about five or 10 of us where what we
06:02 - could do is go onto some kind of app we
06:04 - could see the current Spotify song that
06:05 - was playing and then we could vote to
06:07 - skip that song Or vote to add a new song
06:09 - to the queue I essentially tried to
06:11 - design a collaborative kind of music
06:13 - playing system so that we no longer had
06:15 - to have these arguments about who is
06:17 - going to be controlling the music at a
06:18 - party event when we were playing cards
06:20 - whatever now I actually put this project
06:22 - on YouTube you guys can go and check it
06:24 - out if you want to see that anyways this
06:25 - was a real world app where I learned a
06:27 - ton and I had to constantly commun
06:29 - unicate with the users of the app and
06:31 - see if they were actually getting the
06:33 - value I intended them to get there was a
06:35 - lot of changes I needed to make a lot of
06:36 - things I needed to add and it really
06:38 - made me think about development in a
06:40 - different way that's why I encourage you
06:42 - to build an app that has real
06:44 - [Music]
06:47 - users now the last type of project you
06:49 - need to build to really become a great
06:51 - developer is something with a team or a
06:54 - partner you need to go outside of your
06:56 - Solo preneur or solo developer mindset
06:59 - and realize how you can actually develop
07:01 - with someone else or with a team of
07:03 - people now this will change a lot of
07:04 - things especially if you've never done
07:06 - this before because immediately your
07:07 - code quality now is going to be put into
07:09 - question other people are going to be
07:11 - reading and working with your code
07:13 - people are going to be looking at your
07:14 - poll requests your commit messages and
07:16 - it makes you think about things in a
07:18 - very different way all of a sudden it's
07:20 - not just for you it's for other people
07:22 - as well and you need to learn how to
07:23 - collaborate how to delegate how to make
07:25 - sure multiple people aren't working on
07:27 - the same tasks how to deal with conflict
07:29 - how to use git properly or Version
07:31 - Control software and that's exactly why
07:33 - in my course we encourage you to
07:35 - collaborate with people through our
07:36 - Discord server and our community and we
07:38 - have all kinds of lessons and resources
07:40 - related to git and also just software
07:42 - engineering tools and kind of best
07:44 - practices that you don't stand out as a
07:46 - complete beginner when it comes to
07:48 - collaborative work anyways I encourage
07:50 - you find someone that you can work with
07:52 - now you can do this with a friend if you
07:54 - know other people that are into
07:55 - development you could do this with
07:56 - someone from like a Discord group so
07:58 - whether that be my or my free Discord
08:00 - server you guys could check that out
08:02 - people are always looking for other
08:03 - people to work on projects with and even
08:05 - if you join an open source project
08:07 - that's good too the point is you need to
08:10 - get experience working with other
08:11 - developers see how that works the
08:13 - communication channels and you'll
08:15 - realize that a lot of what you're doing
08:16 - on a day-to-day basis isn't just
08:18 - development it's actually collaboration
08:20 - and it really changes the way in which
08:22 - you do things so to summarize you need
08:24 - to work on a project that you have no
08:26 - idea how to build one that has real
08:28 - users and one that involves
08:29 - collaboration with real people whether
08:31 - that be a team or a partner if you do
08:33 - all of that I guarantee you you will
08:35 - massively improve as a programmer and
08:37 - you will see a huge confidence boost in
08:39 - yourself and the quality of work you can
08:41 - deliver if you guys enjoyed this video
08:43 - make sure to leave a like subscribe to
08:44 - the channel and I will see you in the
08:46 - next

Cleaned transcript:

if you want to be a competent developer you need to work on projects but not just any projects ones that actually give you the skills that make you stand out as a developer that's why in this video I'll share with you three types of projects that are guaranteed to make you a programmer now the first type of project that you need to build is something that you have no idea how to build that's right you need to pick an idea up that seems so incredibly difficult so far out there so forign something that you genuinely don't even know how to begin I'm talking about projects where you might not
