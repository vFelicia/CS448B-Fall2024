00:00 - what I'm holding here is truly one of
00:02 - the most interesting products I've ever
00:03 - seen now this is not a Nintendo DS this
00:06 - is a fully functioning 7-inch Windows 10
00:09 - laptop that's right it has a keyboard on
00:12 - it like this and it folds 360 degrees
00:15 - into a touchscreen tablet that works
00:16 - horizontally and vertically and it's a
00:19 - really interesting product and I've been
00:21 - using it for the past two weeks to
00:22 - gather some thoughts on it then I'm
00:23 - gonna share with you guys today so stick
00:25 - around if you want to hear some of the
00:26 - specs on this thing and if it's actually
00:28 - a usable laptop and can be used as a
00:30 - daily driver so before we get into the
00:40 - review here I'm just gonna quickly
00:41 - mention that I was sent this product for
00:43 - free with the intention of doing a
00:44 - review on it not to mislead any of you
00:46 - guys I'm not being paid to say anything
00:48 - specific about this this is my honest
00:50 - review and my honest opinions about it
00:51 - now with that being said if you are
00:53 - interested in this product there is a
00:55 - product link down below I believe this
00:56 - is available on IndieGoGo right now I'm
00:59 - not sure when it's actually going to be
01:00 - shipped out or when that's gonna be
01:02 - finalized but I'll leave a link to the
01:03 - peak ago website as well in case any of
01:05 - you are interested in having another
01:06 - look and getting some more information
01:07 - about the product so I'm gonna start by
01:17 - just listing some of the specs on this
01:18 - computer and then I'll go into kind of
01:20 - some more details and my thoughts about
01:21 - them so the spec on this is actually an
01:24 - Intel Atom x5 z 8350 cherry processor it
01:28 - has 8 gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of
01:30 - disk space a 7 inch touch screen IPS
01:33 - panel that has a 16 by 10 aspect ratio
01:36 - that turns out to be 1920 by 1200 pixels
01:39 - it has a few ports on the side so a
01:41 - micro HDMI a USB see which is actually
01:44 - how you charge the computer an ordinary
01:46 - USB 3.0 connector a headphone jack a
01:49 - micro SD card reader and a VGA camera as
01:52 - full Wi-Fi and bluetooth capability and
01:54 - a 4500 milliamp battery weighing in at
01:57 - just about 700 grams so if first
02:00 - thoughts here this computer actually
02:02 - seems to be decent but I'm going to talk
02:03 - about some of the limitations of this
02:05 - one of which is that this computer comes
02:07 - in a default mode called windows
02:09 - ass mode now windows s mode is designed
02:11 - for tablet based computers and
02:13 - essentially is meant to kind of boost
02:15 - performance of those computers the main
02:17 - issue with this is it doesn't allow you
02:19 - to download any applications that don't
02:21 - come from the Windows Store while you're
02:23 - in Windows s mode so essentially if you
02:26 - actually want to use this computer for
02:27 - anything other than browsing the web or
02:29 - playing the games or applications that
02:31 - are in the Windows Store you need to
02:33 - turn off windows s mode which makes this
02:35 - computer much much slower I'm going to
02:37 - talk about that as we go through so
02:39 - since this laptop is kind of marketing
02:41 - geared towards people that are traveling
02:42 - a lot let me tell you about my
02:43 - experience traveling with it
02:45 - so recently I've taken the train back
02:47 - and forth from school back to home and
02:49 - I've been using this laptop and trying
02:51 - to see you know what I actually use this
02:52 - on an everyday kind of experience now
02:55 - what's great about this is really the
02:57 - size it fits into pretty much anything
02:58 - if you already you know have a lot
03:00 - packed you can't fit a 15-inch laptop
03:02 - it's really easy to throw this in and
03:03 - the charger for its really nice as well
03:05 - because it's just a USBC so chances are
03:07 - you know you might already have that
03:08 - cable you can plug it into a portable
03:10 - charger you can plug it into your little
03:12 - iPhone brick in the wall and that's a
03:14 - great advantage of this computer for
03:15 - sure now it's marketed that you can put
03:17 - this in your pocket you can fit in your
03:19 - back pocket and pull it out you can do
03:21 - that but no one I don't see anyone
03:24 - carrying this in their back pocket I've
03:25 - personally tried to do it it's seven
03:27 - inches would mean it's fairly large it
03:29 - fills the entire pocket and it is heavy
03:31 - 700 grams you know you're gonna feel
03:33 - that in your back pocket it's not like
03:35 - just carrying an iPhone around and it's
03:37 - really not realistic that you're gonna
03:38 - be walking around with that now the
03:40 - great kind of thing with this is that
03:42 - you can pull it out pretty much anywhere
03:43 - if you want to really quickly you know
03:45 - you're standing in line for something
03:46 - you want to pull it out you want to do
03:47 - something you can do that for sure and
03:49 - you can definitely do it on the train as
03:51 - well you know you want something quickly
03:52 - pull it out do something quick put it
03:54 - back and that's what I kind of use this
03:55 - laptop for maybe I'm in class I want to
03:57 - do a quick Google search or I want to
03:59 - just open up you know my virtual campus
04:01 - online i''m pull out this laptop I can
04:03 - do it and I kind of been describing this
04:05 - laptop for myself use case that's just
04:07 - like a glorified web browser because
04:09 - that's really all that I use it for if I
04:11 - want to get any serious work done I'm
04:13 - gonna pull out my 15 inch or my 13 inch
04:15 - laptop and start working on that because
04:17 - the touchpad on this is very bad in
04:20 - terms of actually moving the mouse the
04:22 - screen is great the
04:23 - screen is really nice it works really
04:24 - well but just if I need to do any
04:26 - programming writing or real work I I
04:28 - can't do it on this computer which
04:30 - brings me to my next point which is this
04:32 - is very very slow like I mentioned
04:35 - before as soon as you turn Windows S
04:36 - mode off it just everything takes a very
04:39 - long time to load and that's because the
04:40 - CPU on this is a very weak not very
04:43 - powerful computer a lot of people read
04:45 - those eight gigs of ram and like oh this
04:46 - will be fine it's like a solid computer
04:47 - I don't know to be honest with you guys
04:50 - this is one of the slowest machines I've
04:51 - ever used and it's very painful going
04:53 - from something like I have here and then
04:55 - trying to work on that so that's kind of
04:57 - my thoughts on that aspect and the
04:59 - traveling aspect of this computer
05:00 - alright so now I want to give you guys
05:02 - some of my final thoughts on this
05:03 - product now I want to start by saying
05:04 - this is a great idea it's really a great
05:07 - concept I like the idea of being able to
05:09 - portably bring around you kind of a
05:10 - laptop tablet whatever you want to call
05:13 - it and be able to use it from anywhere
05:15 - because you really can do that with this
05:16 - computer you're in line you're on the
05:18 - train you're in this tight space you
05:19 - need to bring out something and quickly
05:21 - get some work done you can definitely do
05:22 - that with this computer now what I will
05:25 - say though is this is definitely not a
05:27 - replacement for your laptop if you're
05:29 - thinking you're gonna buy this and you
05:30 - don't need to lug around your 13 or 15
05:32 - inch laptop you're wrong 100% wrong in
05:35 - fact what's happened with me a lot of
05:36 - times is I brought this out try to get
05:39 - something done and just been too
05:40 - frustrated with it just because this
05:41 - mouse thing alone is very difficult to
05:44 - use you I would say it's almost
05:45 - mandatory that you need an actual mouse
05:47 - when you're doing this especially if
05:48 - you're not gonna be using the
05:49 - touchscreen and the keyboard itself you
05:51 - know it's usable you can use it but it's
05:54 - very slow and when I type on it it's
05:56 - just really frustrating so that's kind
05:58 - of my main you know issue with this
05:59 - computer is it's definitely not a
06:01 - replacement for a laptop and I don't
06:03 - think it's necessarily marketed like
06:05 - that but I just want to make sure you
06:06 - guys know that before you know you go
06:08 - and buy something like this look this is
06:09 - a $300 computer so you get what you pay
06:12 - for this works you can use it it's
06:14 - versatile and it's definitely you know
06:15 - for someone that's traveling a lot and
06:17 - just want something quick and easy to
06:19 - pull out and get some simple basic work
06:20 - done but if you need anything more
06:22 - complicated or anything that's gonna be
06:23 - more of a heavy task you're definitely
06:25 - gonna need a real laptop and you can't
06:27 - really use this and that's why I've had
06:29 - a lot of issues with this personally I
06:31 - don't do much work that's just you know
06:32 - like answering emails and light things
06:34 - where I'm just web browsing I do a lot
06:36 - of programming
06:36 - do a lot of keyboard intensive stuff I'd
06:38 - like to have a nice Mouse and that's
06:40 - what my issue comes with this specific
06:42 - computer so anyways this is a great
06:44 - product I love receiving stuff like this
06:46 - and being able to kind of you know use
06:48 - it mess with it and give my opinion on
06:50 - it for me it doesn't really work very
06:52 - well but you know maybe some of you guys
06:53 - have some other use cases where you
06:54 - could see yourself using something like
06:56 - this and I'd love to hear your thoughts
06:57 - about that in the comments down below so
06:59 - with that being said a big thank you
07:00 - again to pica go there links are in the
07:02 - description if you want to check out
07:03 - this product and that being said I will
07:05 - see you guys in another video
