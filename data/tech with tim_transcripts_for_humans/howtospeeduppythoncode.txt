00:00 - how can we speed up our python code well
00:02 - one way to do this is to actually use C
00:05 - code as an extension to our python
00:07 - library or whatever it is that we're
00:08 - creating now python is really built on
00:11 - top of C A lot of people don't know this
00:12 - but there's a lot of you know functions
00:14 - and things that you're actually using
00:15 - that are written natively in C and that
00:17 - python kind of just has an extension for
00:19 - that allow you to use them so if you
00:21 - need to create something that's going to
00:22 - run very quickly in Python and you can't
00:24 - use a different language what you can
00:26 - actually do is write that algorithm and
00:28 - see and import it into your python code
00:30 - as an extension so you can run that code
00:33 - faster than if you had just written it
00:34 - natively in Python
