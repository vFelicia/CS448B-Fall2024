00:00 - software engineering and programming in
00:02 - general is one of those fields where it
00:03 - can feel like you constantly need to be
00:05 - working and that there's never enough
00:06 - hours in the day to get something done
00:08 - so here is how I balance my days as a
00:11 - software developer typically what I do
00:13 - is I allocate a block of the day
00:14 - typically between 8 to 10 hours where
00:17 - I'm going to be working most of that
00:18 - time I'm not programming I'll be doing
00:20 - something like filming YouTube videos
00:21 - answering emails maybe I have a meeting
00:23 - and then typically I'll block out about
00:25 - four or five hours for actually writing
00:28 - code for doing my development now at the
00:30 - same time I also block out time in my
00:31 - mornings to work out to eat breakfast to
00:34 - have dinner at night to watch TV to go
00:36 - out to have fun what I do is I'm
00:38 - intentional about the time that I'm
00:39 - working as well as the time that I'm not
00:42 - working I'm not just saying oh I need to
00:43 - work nine hours today I'm saying not
00:45 - only am I going to work nine hours today
00:46 - I'm going to spend an hour working out
00:47 - I'm gonna spend two hours doing this and
00:49 - I'm gonna have X number of hours where I
00:51 - can do whatever I want you need to be as
00:53 - intentional about the time you're
00:54 - spending away from your computer as you
00:56 - are for the time you're spending on your
00:58 - computer
