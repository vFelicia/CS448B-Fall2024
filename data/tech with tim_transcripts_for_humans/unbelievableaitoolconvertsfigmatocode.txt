00:00 - in this video I'm going to share with
00:01 - you a game-changing AI tool that will
00:04 - quite literally 10x your productivity
00:06 - now if you work with any type of
00:07 - designer then you know that typically
00:08 - what happens is they work in some kind
00:10 - of figma file right they do all this
00:12 - fancy design they make it look great and
00:13 - then they send you the link and they say
00:15 - go build this right they just kind of
00:16 - dump it on you and say build this in
00:18 - react build and react native and you do
00:20 - all of the coding and the layouts and
00:21 - all of that kind of stuff now that's
00:22 - fine but it always seemed a bit silly to
00:24 - me that I had to do that because figma
00:26 - is already well structured right we
00:28 - already have things kind of laid out in
00:29 - groups components all of this stuff why
00:31 - am I just taking this figma file that
00:33 - already looks fantastic and going and
00:35 - writing it in code and then continuing
00:37 - what happens when we want to change a
00:39 - button color or the design changes now
00:40 - all of a sudden I gotta go look at the
00:42 - new figma figure out what change and
00:43 - then go change that in the code now
00:46 - fortunately I'm not the only one who
00:47 - felt this way and that's why now there
00:48 - is an AI tool that will take your entire
00:51 - figma file and translate it into code so
00:54 - whether that's react react negative and
00:56 - it doesn't just give you a bunch of
00:57 - garbage kind of boilerplate code it
00:59 - gives you real functioning code that's
01:01 - reusable and looks just like a human
01:03 - wrote it if not even better
01:06 - stubs of the different function calls it
01:08 - allows you to have interactive elements
01:09 - it's a complete Game Changer and the
01:11 - name of this is locafi now the best part
01:13 - is this is completely free and locify
01:16 - has even sponsored this video so for me
01:17 - this is fantastic because this is a free
01:19 - tool I don't need to tell you guys to
01:20 - buy anything it's awesome it's something
01:22 - I would share with you probably for free
01:24 - and I'm gonna get paid for it so just
01:26 - wanted to let you know they are the
01:27 - sponsor of this video take that for what
01:29 - you will regardless I'm going to give
01:30 - you a quick demo now and show you how
01:32 - locify works really it's a low code tool
01:35 - that's just meant to increase your
01:36 - productivity it's not replacing
01:38 - programmers or UI designers there's
01:39 - still a lot of stuff that you need to do
01:41 - with the design but it's saving you all
01:43 - that upfront design work and kind of
01:45 - manually translating designs into code
01:47 - all right so the way we get this set up
01:49 - is we simply open a figma file this is
01:51 - just a plug-in for figma and you go
01:52 - right here to where it says plugins go
01:55 - to find more plugins
01:56 - and just type locify now you can install
01:59 - this you see there's about 80 000 people
02:00 - using it already probably a lot more as
02:02 - this video is going live anyways I'm
02:04 - going to click on run and it's going to
02:06 - pop up this extension or plug-in for me
02:08 - now what you need to do is connect your
02:09 - account so I'm going to connect to an
02:10 - account and then we will locify this
02:12 - file all right so I just connected my
02:14 - account here and now that we've done
02:15 - that what we need to do is create a new
02:17 - project so I'm going to go here and go
02:19 - to new project I'm going to go with demo
02:22 - app like that then you can select the
02:24 - framework in this case I'm going to go
02:25 - with react because this is a web
02:27 - application you guys can pick you have
02:28 - next gaspi HTML CSS react native Etc now
02:32 - here you get a bunch of different
02:32 - options I'm going to go with Tailwind
02:34 - because that's what I've been using
02:35 - recently and I'll leave that in
02:36 - typescript obviously we're going to want
02:38 - typescript here for react okay so let's
02:40 - go ahead and create that project and
02:42 - I'll just give you a kind of summary of
02:44 - what we need to do here so obviously not
02:46 - every single figma file is going to be
02:48 - as easy to translate to code as others
02:50 - so that's why what locify will do is
02:52 - essentially run an AI analysis on your
02:54 - file and tell you all of the things that
02:56 - you need to fix and actually
02:57 - automatically fix fix most of them for
02:59 - you such that you'll be able to actually
03:01 - transform this into code so kind of the
03:03 - first few steps here to optimize your
03:05 - design to tag the interactive elements
03:07 - you can edit some of the styling do like
03:09 - hover effects and that kind of stuff
03:10 - then you can add actions you can say I
03:12 - want this button to go to this page I
03:14 - want this pop-up to appear so you can
03:16 - actually do quite a few things here that
03:17 - typically you'd only be able to do from
03:18 - code you can just do it directly from
03:20 - locify then you're going to sync this to
03:22 - the Loca 5 Builder which is kind of the
03:24 - online IDE which then allows you to push
03:26 - that to GitHub make pull requests
03:28 - branches Etc but generally what you're
03:31 - going to do here is going to optimize
03:32 - the design do the interactive elements
03:34 - edit the styling Etc so let's go through
03:35 - step one here and optimize our design
03:37 - now this file is kind of already set up
03:39 - for this demo so quite a bit of this is
03:41 - done already but you'll see there's a
03:43 - few things that we can change
03:44 - so here it says remove unnecessary
03:46 - groups and Frames so this will get rid
03:48 - of any unnecessary nesting really that
03:49 - you don't need notice that we can fix
03:51 - individual elements or we can just press
03:53 - fix all so I'll go with fix all here the
03:56 - AI just does its job I don't really even
03:57 - need to think about this too much and
03:59 - then I can go to the next step here
04:01 - which is to convert groups into frames
04:03 - so we have this group object instead we
04:05 - want to frame okay let's fix that again
04:07 - I don't really need to think too hard
04:08 - about this I can just kind of let it do
04:10 - it and then we have applying best
04:12 - practices for images and rectangles so
04:14 - now same thing AI does the analysis we
04:16 - can apply all of these and then we have
04:19 - some more kind of complex fixes we can
04:21 - do here with structuring the frames we
04:22 - actually don't need to do that for this
04:24 - design so for now I'm going to go done
04:26 - with this fix
04:27 - you can see it kind of says pending
04:28 - fixes I'm going to say done with that
04:30 - because I had the home page selected all
04:33 - right so now that we've done uh those
04:35 - main fixes and we've kind of optimized
04:36 - the design the next thing to do is tag
04:38 - our interactive elements so I'm just
04:40 - going to go and select my home page up
04:42 - here okay let me just make this a bit
04:44 - bigger by the way too so I can kind of
04:45 - see what's going on here
04:47 - all right and now we have the option to
04:50 - either auto tag or to select different
04:52 - elements so what I'm going to do is go
04:54 - select my button here because I have a
04:56 - button this search flights button that
04:59 - is not tagged yet so I'm going to kind
05:02 - of Click into this so now I'm on search
05:03 - flights and what I'm going to do is go
05:06 - and tag this so to tag this I'm going to
05:08 - say that this is a button but notice I
05:10 - have a bunch of other things I could tag
05:11 - this as when I do that it gives me an
05:13 - option to select any of the different
05:15 - components from my UI Library so this is
05:17 - essentially saying I want to use a
05:19 - material UI button or an ant design
05:20 - button in this case I'll just go with
05:22 - none and then I have some other options
05:23 - here but for now we'll go with none okay
05:25 - so now that I've tagged this button
05:27 - you'll see that if I click on preview
05:29 - here in locafi what this will allow me
05:31 - to do is actually kind of hover over top
05:33 - of this button and see that this is an
05:35 - interactable element so it takes a sec
05:37 - to load the preview here but you can see
05:39 - now once it kind of loads that if I
05:41 - hover over this I get that kind of mouse
05:43 - action indicating that this is an
05:45 - interactable button whereas for
05:48 - something like this it's not
05:49 - interactable I just get the normal Mouse
05:50 - so you can go through and kind of tag
05:52 - all these different elements that's what
05:53 - the designer would do for you it's
05:55 - automatically going to stub all of the
05:56 - function calls and event listeners as
05:58 - well so that you can then go and kind of
06:00 - hook it up after and do what you need to
06:01 - do with the more advanced logic now we
06:03 - also have the ability to auto tag so if
06:05 - I press on auto tag AI again is going to
06:08 - analyze the entire document uses
06:10 - something called Loco Ai and it's going
06:11 - to show you everything that you should
06:13 - be tagging now you don't have to tag it
06:15 - obviously it can make mistakes but it's
06:16 - quite useful and I also will show you
06:18 - here all the things that are already
06:19 - tacked so this again is kind of set up
06:22 - for the demo purposes obviously you'd
06:24 - normally have to go through and tag some
06:25 - more stuff but in this case it all needs
06:27 - to be suggesting us a few things so we
06:28 - have these two little icons here that we
06:30 - want to tag so yes that is a button okay
06:32 - so let's tag that as a button so I'm
06:34 - going to select none for the UI Library
06:36 - okay let's tag this as a button as well
06:39 - because that's a button and then this is
06:41 - a form so we can go ahead and tag that
06:43 - as a form we can fill in all these
06:44 - properties but we don't really need that
06:45 - right now okay so now we have completed
06:48 - tagging and we now need to do the
06:50 - styling and layouts so if I go to my
06:52 - styling and layout actually first let's
06:54 - do a preview and I'll kind of show you
06:56 - that obviously what can happen sometimes
06:58 - is you can have your designs not being
07:00 - responsive enough so maybe when I shrink
07:02 - the screen or I make it too large the
07:04 - layouts kind of get all messed up so
07:06 - here you can see if I take this and I
07:08 - kind of shrink it you'll notice it looks
07:10 - really weird in this main section here
07:12 - when this is too small so what I can do
07:15 - is actually set different break points
07:16 - here just like I would in CSS and then I
07:18 - can change the different layout at those
07:21 - different break points so what we want
07:22 - to do
07:24 - is we want to take this kind of search
07:25 - container here and we want to make it so
07:27 - that this is a vertical layout rather
07:29 - than a horizontal layout such that
07:31 - everything will kind of Stack all nicely
07:33 - so let's do this what I need to do is
07:35 - kind of find this element so that I can
07:37 - affect the layout so the element for
07:39 - this is going to be the form input row
07:41 - so now that's selected here then what
07:43 - I'm going to do is go to the tablet
07:45 - breakpoint so that's kind of what it
07:47 - looks like right now I'm going to change
07:48 - this to be vertical
07:50 - now when I change this to be vertical
07:51 - we'll give it a second here and you can
07:52 - see it automatically kind of fixes the
07:54 - layout for me and now I have search
07:55 - flights down here and as I start getting
07:57 - smaller you can see that everything kind
08:00 - of scales as it should and looks all
08:01 - nice
08:02 - all right so that's what we'll do for
08:03 - now we also could go to like the button
08:05 - and we could add a hover effect so if I
08:07 - go find my button here so let's close
08:09 - the preview
08:10 - and select the button and then let's go
08:12 - edit styling
08:14 - you can see that I can go to hover and I
08:16 - can do things like change the color so I
08:18 - gotta find where my color is it's right
08:20 - here okay let's make it like a bit
08:22 - darker all right that's done now if we
08:25 - go to our preview
08:27 - okay and we hover over the button you
08:29 - should see that we get that darker color
08:31 - so here now you can see when I'm
08:32 - hovering over search flights now I got
08:34 - the hover effect and again we can do
08:36 - some other stuff here but that's fine
08:37 - for now okay so let's get out of the
08:39 - preview and now we go down to Action Now
08:42 - inside of actions you can do things like
08:43 - scroll into the view change the page you
08:45 - can open an external URL open a pop-up
08:47 - I'm not going to go through actions we
08:49 - don't really need to set anything up for
08:50 - right now so now that we're done all of
08:52 - that we'll actually sync this to the
08:53 - Builder which is kind of the final step
08:55 - where now what we're doing is handing
08:56 - off from UI to the developer so I'll
08:59 - click on sync to locify Builder it says
09:01 - we can do all of the frames or the
09:03 - selected frame in this case I'm just
09:04 - going to do the selected frame which is
09:05 - this one page that I'm working on the
09:07 - home page but obviously you could do all
09:09 - of them at the same time if you want for
09:11 - the projects demo app yeah that's
09:13 - correct okay we can change this if we
09:15 - want to at this point but now I'll leave
09:17 - that there and I'll go to view code and
09:19 - Builder so we'll give this a second to
09:21 - run then I'll start kind of showing you
09:22 - the code how we do the components and
09:23 - whatnot and how we can push this to
09:25 - GitHub all right so this is finished
09:26 - syncing now I'm going to go to view code
09:28 - in Builder now again at this point this
09:30 - is where the developer would kind of
09:32 - Step In it's kind of an IDE for them and
09:34 - you'll see that they can actually view
09:35 - all of the different code and I'm not
09:36 - going to go through all of that all
09:37 - right so we've loaded up here you can
09:39 - see that I've got all the code available
09:40 - to me now and it's automatically created
09:43 - a few main components for me uh for the
09:46 - different pages that we have so we have
09:47 - the home page we have this Matterhorn
09:48 - pop-up uh portal pop-up Etc and you'll
09:51 - notice if we come inside of here it's
09:53 - already stubbed some of the different
09:54 - states and some of the different actions
09:56 - that are going to be performed for us
09:58 - now as we go through here you can see
10:00 - that not everything is uh kind of in a
10:02 - component right now so what we do need
10:04 - to do as the developers decide what we
10:06 - want to be a component which is kind of
10:08 - The Next Step so here it says uh kind of
10:10 - create components so let's just look at
10:12 - this step again can I go back
10:14 - out of here it says make components
10:15 - configure the code and then sync export
10:18 - or deploy now if I go to make components
10:20 - it should actually automatically give me
10:23 - some AI recommendations here which it is
10:24 - for the 12 different components that it
10:27 - thinks that I should be making now I can
10:29 - set these change them Etc but it even
10:31 - specifies what the different props
10:33 - should be so in this case it's talking
10:34 - about these kind of containers saying
10:36 - this should be the flight main container
10:37 - and then these are the different props
10:39 - and the values that we're going to have
10:40 - for those props so I'll go ahead and
10:42 - accept those two instances now it's
10:45 - saying we want to have a trip container
10:46 - so I'll accept those ones as well
10:48 - Hotel container and in fact I'm just
10:51 - going to accept all of these because I'm
10:52 - pretty sure these are all good I can
10:54 - obviously change them after if I want to
10:56 - so now this will create components for
10:57 - all of these different things so now we
10:59 - have our main components we can go
11:01 - change the props if we want to or kind
11:02 - of view through them so now if I go back
11:04 - to the code here by just pressing on
11:06 - this button up at the top you'll see all
11:08 - the different components in the entire
11:09 - project essentially and we can start
11:11 - looking at the different components that
11:12 - have been created so we have the trip
11:13 - container right inside the trip
11:15 - container we have all this different
11:16 - stuff and then again we could continue
11:18 - and make more components if we want we
11:20 - have the portal pop-up we have the hotel
11:21 - card container specifies all the
11:23 - different prop types why we're using
11:25 - typescript so it automatically puts all
11:26 - of that inside for us and this is doing
11:28 - a really good job at making this
11:30 - actually flexible enough that as a
11:31 - developer we can go in now and adjust
11:33 - things and change things so now that
11:34 - we've used the AI to create some
11:36 - automatic components for us I'll show
11:38 - you that we can manually create some as
11:40 - well so for example maybe we want to
11:42 - convert the profile photo or the
11:43 - notification or actually the section
11:45 - there inside of to a component well the
11:47 - way we can do that is we can find find
11:48 - where that is in our tree so in this
11:51 - case the account section is right over
11:52 - here so we can press on the account
11:54 - section and then we can simply go here
11:56 - to make components we can press on
11:58 - Create and then we can go to make
11:59 - component now notice whenever you have
12:01 - this little link icon here this
12:02 - indicates that something is component so
12:04 - the search section is a component the
12:06 - top header is a component Etc so if I go
12:08 - here and I click on make component I can
12:10 - make the name so let's go with account
12:12 - section and click on Create and now
12:14 - we've converted that into a component so
12:16 - now you can see since we have the link
12:17 - here this is a component and we can look
12:19 - inside and see the code for this
12:21 - individual component now obviously I can
12:23 - go add props and styles and some other
12:25 - attributes to this component if I want
12:27 - but for now I think that's all we need
12:29 - so now what we can do after this let's
12:32 - go back to the next step is we can
12:33 - configure the code so we can specify if
12:36 - we want to change it to JavaScript CSS
12:37 - modules Etc in my case this is fine I'll
12:40 - leave it how it is and now we can
12:42 - actually export this code if we're happy
12:43 - with how it's looking right now so if I
12:45 - click on this we have a bunch of
12:46 - different options right we can sync one
12:48 - component we can sync all the components
12:50 - we can do the entire project we can also
12:52 - export them so we can either sync with
12:53 - GitHub we can export as something like a
12:55 - zip file or we can deploy the entire
12:58 - project something like netlify versus
13:00 - Cell GitHub pages and just automatically
13:02 - be able to see our design kind of come
13:03 - to life so that's useful for anyone who
13:05 - is a designer now you don't really need
13:07 - to know much about code you just press a
13:08 - few buttons let AI handle it for you now
13:10 - all of a sudden you have a live
13:11 - production application and you didn't
13:13 - even have to write a single line of code
13:14 - anyways let me go to sync project with
13:16 - GitHub which is what we'll do I'm going
13:18 - to connect with GitHub kind of go
13:19 - through these steps and then let's have
13:21 - a look at the repository alright so I've
13:22 - synced with GitHub and I'm just going to
13:24 - make a new repository I'll just call
13:25 - this locify demo like that okay okay
13:30 - let's go confirm repo and branch and
13:34 - then it's going to give us the ability
13:35 - to push all of this to GitHub so we can
13:37 - kind of choose what files we want in
13:38 - this case I'm going to go with all of
13:39 - them so I'm going to push that to GitHub
13:41 - let's give that a second and then I'm
13:42 - going to show you what happens if we
13:43 - have conflicts because lokify actually
13:45 - has an AI tool that helps you handle
13:47 - conflicts between the design and then
13:49 - whatever you've actually done in the
13:51 - code from say your local machine alright
13:52 - so I've just opened this up in GitHub
13:54 - now you can see everything was created
13:55 - for me I'm just going to copy the URL
13:58 - for this and I'm going to go now clone
14:00 - this and then open it up in vs code make
14:02 - a change and then show you how we can
14:03 - handle the conflicts from the loca5
14:05 - Builder alright so I've just opened up
14:07 - the Clone project now from my local
14:09 - machine what I'm going to do now is just
14:11 - make a change in here push that to
14:12 - GitHub and then show you how locify can
14:15 - automatically handle any of the
14:16 - conflicts and keep the design in sync
14:19 - with the code which is a pretty cool
14:20 - feature so what I'm going to do here is
14:21 - go to where I have this search flights
14:23 - button and I'm just going to change the
14:25 - color so rather than having where is it
14:27 - BG orange I'll just go with BG black and
14:31 - then I'll simply change this to say
14:32 - flights
14:34 - finder or something I know it doesn't
14:36 - really make sense but we're just doing
14:37 - some simple changes so now we'll just
14:39 - make a commit we'll say
14:42 - kind of change button and then get push
14:46 - origin main like that okay and now this
14:50 - will update the repository alright so
14:51 - now that I've made a change here let me
14:53 - go back to my figma file actually I'll
14:54 - start making some changes in figma I'll
14:57 - re-sync that with the Builder and then
14:59 - I'll show you kind of what happens here
15:00 - in terms of the conflict resolution
15:02 - which is automatically handled for you
15:04 - so let's go to this button here okay so
15:06 - let me click into this we're going to go
15:07 - to edit styling and layout and I want to
15:10 - change the color of this button so how
15:12 - do I do that
15:13 - go to normal
15:15 - scroll down okay color let's make that
15:17 - something like this kind of pink color
15:19 - okay we'll go with done
15:21 - and then we'll just sync this to the
15:23 - Builder so let's view that in the
15:25 - builder then I'll try to push it to
15:26 - GitHub and show you what happens all
15:27 - right so it says this is ready so let's
15:29 - go to the code Builder now now from here
15:31 - all I'm going to do is just sync this
15:33 - directly to GitHub because I've kind of
15:34 - changed the color of the button so let's
15:36 - go here to sync and we'll go sync
15:39 - project with GitHub all right so notice
15:41 - here as we try to do this it actually
15:43 - pops up and tells us that we have some
15:44 - conflicts we also have a modified file
15:46 - inside of Tailwind so what I can do is
15:48 - click on my search container here which
15:50 - has the conflict I can go resolve
15:52 - conflicts and then I can go through here
15:54 - and see all of the changes that are on
15:55 - locify as well as which exist inside of
15:58 - the repository just like I would inside
16:00 - of a normal kind of GitHub UI right so
16:02 - in this case you can see that I've just
16:03 - made a change to the background color
16:05 - here it says BG pink and then here it's
16:07 - BG black so I have to decide what I want
16:09 - to accept here sorry so I'm going to
16:11 - accept the GitHub change which is on the
16:14 - left side and on the right side would be
16:16 - the locify change okay so that's pretty
16:18 - much it I'm now going to mark this as
16:19 - resolved and then I can complete the
16:21 - merge and the push so just like we have
16:23 - have kind of a conflict resolution for
16:25 - us in vs code we have that in locify
16:28 - meaning now if a designer does something
16:30 - inside of the figma file you can
16:31 - actually go in and decide what you want
16:33 - to keep or what you want to change so if
16:35 - I want to push this here I just select
16:36 - the branch name in this case it's main I
16:37 - gave it access to main so it can push
16:39 - directly to it and now we'll see that
16:41 - those changes will be applied inside of
16:43 - the repository all right so with that
16:44 - said I think I'm going to wrap up the
16:46 - video here this is a really cool tool as
16:48 - you can see we literally went from a
16:50 - figma design to a fully functional
16:51 - project in just a few minutes this is
16:54 - something I'm definitely going to be
16:55 - using as a part of my startup even
16:57 - though this was a sponsored video I hope
16:59 - you guys got a ton of value from it and
17:01 - you're able to check out this completely
17:02 - free tool by clicking the link in the
17:04 - description or by checking it out with
17:06 - figma now just as a last Point here this
17:09 - isn't something that's designed to
17:10 - replace you as a programmer it just
17:12 - meant to kind of accelerate your
17:14 - workflow and allow you to spend more
17:16 - time on the complicated logic and
17:18 - hooking things up and apis and all that
17:20 - kind of stuff as opposed to doing that
17:21 - General design which again kind kind of
17:24 - should be automated for you if a
17:25 - designer's already doing all that work
17:27 - why are you repeating it now and just
17:29 - translating it into code this is a
17:31 - fantastic tool I hope you guys enjoyed
17:32 - the video if you did make sure to leave
17:34 - a like subscribe to the channel and I
17:35 - will see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to share with you a gamechanging AI tool that will quite literally 10x your productivity now if you work with any type of designer then you know that typically what happens is they work in some kind of figma file right they do all this fancy design they make it look great and then they send you the link and they say go build this right they just kind of dump it on you and say build this in react build and react native and you do all of the coding and the layouts and all of that kind of stuff now that's fine but it always seemed a bit silly to me that I had to do that because figma is already well structured right we already have things kind of laid out in groups components all of this stuff why am I just taking this figma file that already looks fantastic and going and writing it in code and then continuing what happens when we want to change a button color or the design changes now all of a sudden I gotta go look at the new figma figure out what change and then go change that in the code now fortunately I'm not the only one who felt this way and that's why now there is an AI tool that will take your entire figma file and translate it into code so whether that's react react negative and it doesn't just give you a bunch of garbage kind of boilerplate code it gives you real functioning code that's reusable and looks just like a human wrote it if not even better stubs of the different function calls it allows you to have interactive elements it's a complete Game Changer and the name of this is locafi now the best part is this is completely free and locify has even sponsored this video so for me this is fantastic because this is a free tool I don't need to tell you guys to buy anything it's awesome it's something I would share with you probably for free and I'm gonna get paid for it so just wanted to let you know they are the sponsor of this video take that for what you will regardless I'm going to give you a quick demo now and show you how locify works really it's a low code tool that's just meant to increase your productivity it's not replacing programmers or UI designers there's still a lot of stuff that you need to do with the design but it's saving you all that upfront design work and kind of manually translating designs into code all right so the way we get this set up is we simply open a figma file this is just a plugin for figma and you go right here to where it says plugins go to find more plugins and just type locify now you can install this you see there's about 80 000 people using it already probably a lot more as this video is going live anyways I'm going to click on run and it's going to pop up this extension or plugin for me now what you need to do is connect your account so I'm going to connect to an account and then we will locify this file all right so I just connected my account here and now that we've done that what we need to do is create a new project so I'm going to go here and go to new project I'm going to go with demo app like that then you can select the framework in this case I'm going to go with react because this is a web application you guys can pick you have next gaspi HTML CSS react native Etc now here you get a bunch of different options I'm going to go with Tailwind because that's what I've been using recently and I'll leave that in typescript obviously we're going to want typescript here for react okay so let's go ahead and create that project and I'll just give you a kind of summary of what we need to do here so obviously not every single figma file is going to be as easy to translate to code as others so that's why what locify will do is essentially run an AI analysis on your file and tell you all of the things that you need to fix and actually automatically fix fix most of them for you such that you'll be able to actually transform this into code so kind of the first few steps here to optimize your design to tag the interactive elements you can edit some of the styling do like hover effects and that kind of stuff then you can add actions you can say I want this button to go to this page I want this popup to appear so you can actually do quite a few things here that typically you'd only be able to do from code you can just do it directly from locify then you're going to sync this to the Loca 5 Builder which is kind of the online IDE which then allows you to push that to GitHub make pull requests branches Etc but generally what you're going to do here is going to optimize the design do the interactive elements edit the styling Etc so let's go through step one here and optimize our design now this file is kind of already set up for this demo so quite a bit of this is done already but you'll see there's a few things that we can change so here it says remove unnecessary groups and Frames so this will get rid of any unnecessary nesting really that you don't need notice that we can fix individual elements or we can just press fix all so I'll go with fix all here the AI just does its job I don't really even need to think about this too much and then I can go to the next step here which is to convert groups into frames so we have this group object instead we want to frame okay let's fix that again I don't really need to think too hard about this I can just kind of let it do it and then we have applying best practices for images and rectangles so now same thing AI does the analysis we can apply all of these and then we have some more kind of complex fixes we can do here with structuring the frames we actually don't need to do that for this design so for now I'm going to go done with this fix you can see it kind of says pending fixes I'm going to say done with that because I had the home page selected all right so now that we've done uh those main fixes and we've kind of optimized the design the next thing to do is tag our interactive elements so I'm just going to go and select my home page up here okay let me just make this a bit bigger by the way too so I can kind of see what's going on here all right and now we have the option to either auto tag or to select different elements so what I'm going to do is go select my button here because I have a button this search flights button that is not tagged yet so I'm going to kind of Click into this so now I'm on search flights and what I'm going to do is go and tag this so to tag this I'm going to say that this is a button but notice I have a bunch of other things I could tag this as when I do that it gives me an option to select any of the different components from my UI Library so this is essentially saying I want to use a material UI button or an ant design button in this case I'll just go with none and then I have some other options here but for now we'll go with none okay so now that I've tagged this button you'll see that if I click on preview here in locafi what this will allow me to do is actually kind of hover over top of this button and see that this is an interactable element so it takes a sec to load the preview here but you can see now once it kind of loads that if I hover over this I get that kind of mouse action indicating that this is an interactable button whereas for something like this it's not interactable I just get the normal Mouse so you can go through and kind of tag all these different elements that's what the designer would do for you it's automatically going to stub all of the function calls and event listeners as well so that you can then go and kind of hook it up after and do what you need to do with the more advanced logic now we also have the ability to auto tag so if I press on auto tag AI again is going to analyze the entire document uses something called Loco Ai and it's going to show you everything that you should be tagging now you don't have to tag it obviously it can make mistakes but it's quite useful and I also will show you here all the things that are already tacked so this again is kind of set up for the demo purposes obviously you'd normally have to go through and tag some more stuff but in this case it all needs to be suggesting us a few things so we have these two little icons here that we want to tag so yes that is a button okay so let's tag that as a button so I'm going to select none for the UI Library okay let's tag this as a button as well because that's a button and then this is a form so we can go ahead and tag that as a form we can fill in all these properties but we don't really need that right now okay so now we have completed tagging and we now need to do the styling and layouts so if I go to my styling and layout actually first let's do a preview and I'll kind of show you that obviously what can happen sometimes is you can have your designs not being responsive enough so maybe when I shrink the screen or I make it too large the layouts kind of get all messed up so here you can see if I take this and I kind of shrink it you'll notice it looks really weird in this main section here when this is too small so what I can do is actually set different break points here just like I would in CSS and then I can change the different layout at those different break points so what we want to do is we want to take this kind of search container here and we want to make it so that this is a vertical layout rather than a horizontal layout such that everything will kind of Stack all nicely so let's do this what I need to do is kind of find this element so that I can affect the layout so the element for this is going to be the form input row so now that's selected here then what I'm going to do is go to the tablet breakpoint so that's kind of what it looks like right now I'm going to change this to be vertical now when I change this to be vertical we'll give it a second here and you can see it automatically kind of fixes the layout for me and now I have search flights down here and as I start getting smaller you can see that everything kind of scales as it should and looks all nice all right so that's what we'll do for now we also could go to like the button and we could add a hover effect so if I go find my button here so let's close the preview and select the button and then let's go edit styling you can see that I can go to hover and I can do things like change the color so I gotta find where my color is it's right here okay let's make it like a bit darker all right that's done now if we go to our preview okay and we hover over the button you should see that we get that darker color so here now you can see when I'm hovering over search flights now I got the hover effect and again we can do some other stuff here but that's fine for now okay so let's get out of the preview and now we go down to Action Now inside of actions you can do things like scroll into the view change the page you can open an external URL open a popup I'm not going to go through actions we don't really need to set anything up for right now so now that we're done all of that we'll actually sync this to the Builder which is kind of the final step where now what we're doing is handing off from UI to the developer so I'll click on sync to locify Builder it says we can do all of the frames or the selected frame in this case I'm just going to do the selected frame which is this one page that I'm working on the home page but obviously you could do all of them at the same time if you want for the projects demo app yeah that's correct okay we can change this if we want to at this point but now I'll leave that there and I'll go to view code and Builder so we'll give this a second to run then I'll start kind of showing you the code how we do the components and whatnot and how we can push this to GitHub all right so this is finished syncing now I'm going to go to view code in Builder now again at this point this is where the developer would kind of Step In it's kind of an IDE for them and you'll see that they can actually view all of the different code and I'm not going to go through all of that all right so we've loaded up here you can see that I've got all the code available to me now and it's automatically created a few main components for me uh for the different pages that we have so we have the home page we have this Matterhorn popup uh portal popup Etc and you'll notice if we come inside of here it's already stubbed some of the different states and some of the different actions that are going to be performed for us now as we go through here you can see that not everything is uh kind of in a component right now so what we do need to do as the developers decide what we want to be a component which is kind of The Next Step so here it says uh kind of create components so let's just look at this step again can I go back out of here it says make components configure the code and then sync export or deploy now if I go to make components it should actually automatically give me some AI recommendations here which it is for the 12 different components that it thinks that I should be making now I can set these change them Etc but it even specifies what the different props should be so in this case it's talking about these kind of containers saying this should be the flight main container and then these are the different props and the values that we're going to have for those props so I'll go ahead and accept those two instances now it's saying we want to have a trip container so I'll accept those ones as well Hotel container and in fact I'm just going to accept all of these because I'm pretty sure these are all good I can obviously change them after if I want to so now this will create components for all of these different things so now we have our main components we can go change the props if we want to or kind of view through them so now if I go back to the code here by just pressing on this button up at the top you'll see all the different components in the entire project essentially and we can start looking at the different components that have been created so we have the trip container right inside the trip container we have all this different stuff and then again we could continue and make more components if we want we have the portal popup we have the hotel card container specifies all the different prop types why we're using typescript so it automatically puts all of that inside for us and this is doing a really good job at making this actually flexible enough that as a developer we can go in now and adjust things and change things so now that we've used the AI to create some automatic components for us I'll show you that we can manually create some as well so for example maybe we want to convert the profile photo or the notification or actually the section there inside of to a component well the way we can do that is we can find find where that is in our tree so in this case the account section is right over here so we can press on the account section and then we can simply go here to make components we can press on Create and then we can go to make component now notice whenever you have this little link icon here this indicates that something is component so the search section is a component the top header is a component Etc so if I go here and I click on make component I can make the name so let's go with account section and click on Create and now we've converted that into a component so now you can see since we have the link here this is a component and we can look inside and see the code for this individual component now obviously I can go add props and styles and some other attributes to this component if I want but for now I think that's all we need so now what we can do after this let's go back to the next step is we can configure the code so we can specify if we want to change it to JavaScript CSS modules Etc in my case this is fine I'll leave it how it is and now we can actually export this code if we're happy with how it's looking right now so if I click on this we have a bunch of different options right we can sync one component we can sync all the components we can do the entire project we can also export them so we can either sync with GitHub we can export as something like a zip file or we can deploy the entire project something like netlify versus Cell GitHub pages and just automatically be able to see our design kind of come to life so that's useful for anyone who is a designer now you don't really need to know much about code you just press a few buttons let AI handle it for you now all of a sudden you have a live production application and you didn't even have to write a single line of code anyways let me go to sync project with GitHub which is what we'll do I'm going to connect with GitHub kind of go through these steps and then let's have a look at the repository alright so I've synced with GitHub and I'm just going to make a new repository I'll just call this locify demo like that okay okay let's go confirm repo and branch and then it's going to give us the ability to push all of this to GitHub so we can kind of choose what files we want in this case I'm going to go with all of them so I'm going to push that to GitHub let's give that a second and then I'm going to show you what happens if we have conflicts because lokify actually has an AI tool that helps you handle conflicts between the design and then whatever you've actually done in the code from say your local machine alright so I've just opened this up in GitHub now you can see everything was created for me I'm just going to copy the URL for this and I'm going to go now clone this and then open it up in vs code make a change and then show you how we can handle the conflicts from the loca5 Builder alright so I've just opened up the Clone project now from my local machine what I'm going to do now is just make a change in here push that to GitHub and then show you how locify can automatically handle any of the conflicts and keep the design in sync with the code which is a pretty cool feature so what I'm going to do here is go to where I have this search flights button and I'm just going to change the color so rather than having where is it BG orange I'll just go with BG black and then I'll simply change this to say flights finder or something I know it doesn't really make sense but we're just doing some simple changes so now we'll just make a commit we'll say kind of change button and then get push origin main like that okay and now this will update the repository alright so now that I've made a change here let me go back to my figma file actually I'll start making some changes in figma I'll resync that with the Builder and then I'll show you kind of what happens here in terms of the conflict resolution which is automatically handled for you so let's go to this button here okay so let me click into this we're going to go to edit styling and layout and I want to change the color of this button so how do I do that go to normal scroll down okay color let's make that something like this kind of pink color okay we'll go with done and then we'll just sync this to the Builder so let's view that in the builder then I'll try to push it to GitHub and show you what happens all right so it says this is ready so let's go to the code Builder now now from here all I'm going to do is just sync this directly to GitHub because I've kind of changed the color of the button so let's go here to sync and we'll go sync project with GitHub all right so notice here as we try to do this it actually pops up and tells us that we have some conflicts we also have a modified file inside of Tailwind so what I can do is click on my search container here which has the conflict I can go resolve conflicts and then I can go through here and see all of the changes that are on locify as well as which exist inside of the repository just like I would inside of a normal kind of GitHub UI right so in this case you can see that I've just made a change to the background color here it says BG pink and then here it's BG black so I have to decide what I want to accept here sorry so I'm going to accept the GitHub change which is on the left side and on the right side would be the locify change okay so that's pretty much it I'm now going to mark this as resolved and then I can complete the merge and the push so just like we have have kind of a conflict resolution for us in vs code we have that in locify meaning now if a designer does something inside of the figma file you can actually go in and decide what you want to keep or what you want to change so if I want to push this here I just select the branch name in this case it's main I gave it access to main so it can push directly to it and now we'll see that those changes will be applied inside of the repository all right so with that said I think I'm going to wrap up the video here this is a really cool tool as you can see we literally went from a figma design to a fully functional project in just a few minutes this is something I'm definitely going to be using as a part of my startup even though this was a sponsored video I hope you guys got a ton of value from it and you're able to check out this completely free tool by clicking the link in the description or by checking it out with figma now just as a last Point here this isn't something that's designed to replace you as a programmer it just meant to kind of accelerate your workflow and allow you to spend more time on the complicated logic and hooking things up and apis and all that kind of stuff as opposed to doing that General design which again kind kind of should be automated for you if a designer's already doing all that work why are you repeating it now and just translating it into code this is a fantastic tool I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one foreign
