00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - gonna be talking to you guys about how
00:05 - difficult computer science is now if
00:08 - you're subscribed to my channel you'll
00:09 - know that I'm 18 and I'm just about
00:12 - finished my first year of computer
00:13 - science so actually live in Canada and
00:15 - I'm going to a university in Ontario
00:17 - where I'm majoring in computer science
00:20 - and I believe my exact program is honors
00:22 - computer science co-op and then I'm
00:25 - actually in the entrepreneur and
00:27 - business stream which means is I take
00:29 - one or two business electives each year
00:31 - and then when I graduate I get that
00:33 - extra little tag on my diploma saying
00:35 - that I likes did entrepreneurship so
00:37 - that's the exact program that I'm in
00:39 - what I'm gonna do in this video is I'm
00:41 - gonna start by just explaining a bit
00:43 - about computer science in general what
00:45 - it really is what you're taking in
00:48 - University and then I'm gonna go through
00:50 - my first-year courses I'm gonna show you
00:52 - guys the averages for those classes my
00:54 - average for those classes and kind of
00:57 - explain why maybe some courses are more
00:59 - difficult than others or which ones are
01:01 - more difficult so you guys get an exact
01:03 - idea of what it's like rather than me
01:05 - just saying no it's not hard or yes it's
01:07 - hard okay so if you guys want to see
01:08 - exactly how I did in all my computer
01:10 - science classes make sure you stay tuned
01:12 - to the end of the video I feel like some
01:14 - of you guys might be interested in that
01:15 - so anyways alright so what I'm gonna do
01:17 - now is just talk in general about what
01:21 - is computer science a lot of people
01:23 - don't actually really know what computer
01:25 - science is before taking it and going
01:27 - into university now essentially what it
01:30 - is is it's not being a programmer a lot
01:33 - of people think computer science are
01:34 - just writing tons of lines of code and
01:36 - just being really good at coding yes
01:39 - obviously that's an aspect to it but
01:41 - it's really focused around efficiency
01:43 - algorithms design the ways that computer
01:46 - work and knowing these things allows you
01:49 - to write much better code so at the end
01:51 - of the day yes it comes down to writing
01:54 - really good code for your assignments
01:55 - and your projects and having good
01:57 - flowing programs but it's also really
02:00 - about the way that you approach problems
02:03 - the way that you think about things
02:04 - designing algorithms and if you graduate
02:07 - with the computer science degree that
02:09 - means you can take those skills to any
02:11 - different kind of program
02:12 - language it's not just like oh you're
02:14 - really good at Java programming yeah you
02:16 - might be but if you have the computer
02:18 - science fundamentals like you know a lot
02:19 - about algorithms or you know how to
02:21 - approach a problem or maybe you're good
02:23 - at machine learning then you can do that
02:25 - in any language and all that's gonna
02:27 - differ is the syntax and the words in
02:29 - that language that you're using okay so
02:30 - now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
02:32 - through my different courses I have to
02:34 - take five courses per semester I'm in my
02:37 - second semester right now so let's start
02:38 - with first semester go through which
02:40 - courses I took and the averages and how
02:43 - I did in those classes so the first
02:45 - course I had to take was calculus one
02:47 - now calculus one I have to look at my
02:50 - transcript here because I always forget
02:51 - and I'll pop it up on the screen I go
02:53 - out in a in calculus one which
02:55 - translates to a 9.0 out of ten point on
02:58 - a GPA scale you guys can convert that to
03:00 - like a 4.0 scale if that's what you use
03:02 - the class average for that was a 5.4 3
03:06 - GPA which is sitting around 60 to 65% so
03:10 - you can tell that most people that took
03:12 - that that actually finished the class
03:14 - because this is not account for the
03:15 - people that dropped out of it didn't do
03:18 - amazing and a lot of people found it
03:19 - difficult now I would say Kelley this
03:21 - one is probably one of the hardest
03:24 - first-year classes and that is just
03:26 - because it's just difficult a lot of the
03:28 - math that you have to do you're dealing
03:30 - with integrals with least that's what
03:32 - I'm doing that you might might be
03:33 - different curriculum and whatever school
03:34 - you're going to and it's kind of a big
03:37 - step up and it requires a lot of
03:38 - practice if you are not constantly
03:40 - practicing and doing your homework you
03:42 - are not gonna do well in that class and
03:43 - I think a lot of people are used to high
03:44 - school like I was where you just go in I
03:47 - don't maybe did a few practice questions
03:49 - before the tests or whatever and you're
03:51 - just fine this if you haven't been
03:52 - practicing like every after each lecture
03:55 - you're probably not gonna do well and I
03:56 - think that's why a lot of people found
03:58 - it very difficult because it just
03:59 - requires a lot of practice ok so the
04:01 - next class I had to take was
04:03 - introduction to linear algebra now this
04:06 - just sounds intimidating when you hear
04:07 - linear algebra you're kind of like okay
04:09 - Wow
04:10 - like what is linear algebra is a
04:12 - difficult class but it is not like crazy
04:15 - difficult so I finished that finished
04:17 - that class with an a-minus which is like
04:19 - I think it's like 80 to 85% and the
04:22 - class average for that was five point
04:23 - one six GPA out of ten we
04:26 - again equates to about a 60% so a lot of
04:28 - people found that class very difficult
04:31 - and in fact I think actually like 35
04:34 - percent of my class dropped out for
04:36 - making it to the exam because they
04:37 - didn't want that like F or the fail on
04:40 - their transcript and they already did
04:42 - horribly on the midterms so yeah so
04:44 - anyways a lot of people find that cost
04:46 - difficult because it deals with really
04:47 - abstract concepts the actual math that
04:50 - you perform is not hard by any means in
04:52 - fact I'd say that if you know like grade
04:54 - 9 or 10 math you're able to complete
04:56 - almost any like math equation or
04:58 - anything that it needs you to do in that
05:00 - class it's just a really abstract
05:02 - concept you're dealing with matrixes and
05:04 - multiple dimensions and a lot of people
05:06 - get caught up in the fact that you can't
05:07 - really visualize what you're doing for
05:09 - example if you're dealing with a 12
05:11 - dimensional matrix you can't like you
05:14 - can't visualize what that looks like you
05:16 - used to three dimensional math with up
05:18 - to three variables X Y Z and now you're
05:20 - dealing with like 10 15 20 infinite
05:23 - amount of dimensions and a lot of people
05:25 - just get really confused and let that
05:26 - kind of I don't know distract them from
05:28 - how to do the math so the next class I
05:30 - was in was introduction to computing one
05:32 - this class is an absolute joke you've
05:35 - done anything with computer science like
05:37 - I mean like you've just written any kind
05:39 - of Python you've written any code like
05:40 - you can consider yourself a beginner you
05:42 - will be far ahead in this class they
05:44 - have to teach you like introduction
05:46 - clock they have to do like an
05:48 - introduction programming class and make
05:49 - it mandatory because they have to make
05:51 - assume that everyone knows nothing about
05:53 - programming going into University
05:54 - because a lot of high schools don't
05:56 - offer programming so they kind of teach
05:59 - it like from the very beginning which
06:02 - means if you've done anything with that
06:04 - you you'll be fine so you guys already
06:05 - imagined I got an A+ in that class I
06:07 - pretty well teach this class on my
06:09 - youtube channel and it was just it's
06:10 - just an absolute joke so if you have
06:12 - done anything with programming don't
06:13 - worry about your first year computing
06:14 - classes they're gonna be a breeze
06:16 - ok next class I was in was engineering
06:18 - economics and technical report writing
06:20 - now these two so technical report
06:23 - writing it was required some in the
06:25 - Faculty of engineering so I have to take
06:26 - that class that class is super easy as
06:29 - well it's just like really basic grammar
06:30 - and how to structure reports and do
06:32 - documents I hate the class it's boring I
06:35 - hate writing but I got an A in it it's
06:37 - really easy class average for that was 7
06:39 - y41 like that's a high-class outrage for
06:42 - university so that means most people go
06:44 - like a 75 okay next one engineering
06:47 - economics I got an A+ in this this is a
06:50 - elective class I chose to take this
06:51 - likely you won't have to take any class
06:53 - like that you'll get to pick I don't
06:55 - know enjoyed that class and just taught
06:57 - a bit about business so I haven't yet
06:59 - finished these classes obviously but I
07:00 - kind of have an idea of their difficulty
07:02 - level so let's start by talking about
07:03 - introduction to computing - so
07:05 - introduction to computing - is a massive
07:08 - step up from introduction to computing
07:09 - one and it is taught in Java so the
07:11 - other one I think I mentioned was taught
07:13 - in Python this one is taught in Java so
07:15 - being taught in Java
07:16 - it means already the language is bit
07:18 - more difficult to use and they don't
07:19 - actually teach any of the syntax they
07:21 - just tell you like we're gonna continue
07:23 - learning about computer science concepts
07:25 - with the language Java not like we're
07:27 - teaching you Java just we're using Java
07:29 - to teach you concepts if that makes
07:31 - sense to you guys
07:32 - so I what we've done in this class so
07:34 - far and I haven't found it very
07:35 - difficult I got 96 on the midterm that I
07:39 - wrote a few days ago is like
07:40 - polymorphism inheritance what do you
07:44 - call it interfaces that's the word I'm
07:47 - okay interfaces I don't know why I
07:48 - couldn't remember that and then they
07:50 - have stuff like what do you do next acts
07:52 - queues just really like basic stuff we
07:55 - dealt with generics I don't know if you
07:57 - guys know what that is
07:57 - but nothing crazy difficult not by the
07:59 - end of the year we're doing some like
08:01 - graphical user interface stuff we're
08:03 - doing a few other like different kind of
08:05 - algorithms binary search trees just
08:06 - really fundamental computer science
08:08 - concepts that aren't crazy difficult but
08:10 - you know you do kind of have to practice
08:12 - them a little bit so that computing to
08:13 - class is a step up obviously from
08:15 - competing one but by no means what I say
08:17 - it's very difficult and you know if
08:19 - you're into programming it's almost like
08:21 - you kind of just enjoy doing it like I
08:23 - genuinely enjoy doing a lot of the work
08:24 - for that class and I'm it that being
08:26 - said I don't really consider it work
08:28 - right ok so next class I have to take
08:30 - and you will likely have to take as well
08:31 - is discrete math for computing this
08:34 - class is difficult um I'm doing ok in
08:37 - this class right now but it is it's just
08:39 - very weird it's nothing like you've ever
08:41 - done before it deals with set theory it
08:44 - deals with proving like formulas proving
08:47 - like you just do proofs like you have to
08:49 - prove that something equals something
08:50 - which seems like it just
08:52 - just difficult I need in like truth
08:54 - tables and basic logics like and or not
08:58 - but kind of with some weird like more
09:02 - difficult than I'm just explaining right
09:03 - there it's not class is difficult I
09:04 - can't tell you obviously with the class
09:05 - averages because I'm not finished yet
09:07 - but I'd assume it'll be fairly low next
09:09 - class digital systems this class is
09:11 - actually super interesting and it deals
09:13 - with really low level logic on how a
09:15 - computer actually works and it deals
09:17 - with like an gates nor gates Nan's
09:19 - latches memory if you guys know what any
09:22 - of that means then you know what it
09:24 - means but anyways it just deals with
09:26 - like really low-level logic which is
09:27 - really interesting and kind of gives you
09:29 - a different perspective on how computers
09:31 - work it is a bit of a difficult class
09:33 - but it's not it's not that hard if you
09:35 - practice and you actually read like a
09:38 - lot of the notes and whatnot take notes
09:40 - go to class it's not a nothing too crazy
09:42 - and finally the two other classes that
09:44 - I'm doing this semester are actually
09:47 - have to look cuz why do I forget what
09:49 - ones I'm doing that's probably not good
09:50 - calculus too
09:51 - yeah so calculus 2 is I would actually
09:54 - argue easier than calculus 1 you do need
09:56 - calculus 1 to be able to do calculus 2 I
09:59 - mean it makes sense 1 2 but the concepts
10:01 - are just simpler I would say and if you
10:04 - do the practice really calculus and math
10:06 - like that it's just practice practice
10:07 - practice
10:08 - it's not difficult at all and you can
10:10 - definitely get you can easily get 100 in
10:12 - that class if you just continually did
10:15 - the practice but that being said I mean
10:17 - most people don't do that so a lot of
10:19 - people do struggle with that next one
10:20 - I'm in is I have to look on here again
10:23 - Oh introduction to business management
10:24 - so again I know time in this
10:26 - entrepreneurship stream so I have to
10:27 - take some business electives this class
10:29 - I mean it's not really you guys probably
10:31 - aren't gonna have to take it it's pretty
10:33 - interesting it just kind of talks about
10:34 - you know we call it management what I
10:37 - say did I say business management yeah
10:39 - ok so it talks about management and just
10:41 - how to be a good manager in different
10:42 - aspects to look at in business and you
10:44 - know kind of from like an engineering
10:46 - like science perspective side to go into
10:48 - a class like that is interesting and
10:50 - just kind of hear some different
10:51 - perspectives and see different ways that
10:53 - people think because I think very
10:55 - logically and linear as opposed to like
10:58 - creatively and out-of-the-box which can
11:00 - be an advantage or a disadvantage so
11:01 - it's nice to kind of get some different
11:03 - perspective and take it
11:04 - different kind of class so anyways that
11:06 - has kind of been it about computer
11:08 - science I apologize for this video being
11:10 - so long but I wanted to give you guys a
11:12 - really good in-depth kind of look at to
11:15 - what you're gonna have to take a little
11:17 - summary about each of them not too much
11:19 - but not too little how the class does an
11:21 - average on those how I do in my opinion
11:24 - on it so just to wrap up here computer
11:26 - science if you guys are into computer
11:28 - science and you actually like what
11:29 - you're doing first year it might sound
11:31 - difficult it might sound intimidating
11:33 - but what they try to do is they try to
11:35 - actually flush out all the students that
11:38 - can't handle it in first year personally
11:40 - in my program the reason why there's so
11:42 - many required math classes in first year
11:44 - is because once you get to second year
11:45 - third year fourth year they want to make
11:47 - sure the students that are there are
11:48 - serious about the degree that they're
11:50 - taking and a lot of people jump into
11:52 - computer science without any programming
11:54 - knowledge without any idea really what
11:57 - it is and when they get into first year
11:59 - they see all these hard courses and they
12:01 - just kind of jump ship or they change
12:03 - programs and I know actually a lot of
12:05 - people that have done that or that are
12:07 - thinking about doing that so they give
12:08 - you all these hard math classes to kind
12:10 - of flush out the people that you know
12:11 - don't really know what they're doing or
12:13 - don't want to be there and then in the
12:15 - next year's everything gets a lot better
12:17 - because you just get so much more
12:18 - freedom and selection in what you get to
12:20 - choose and I don't know personally I'm
12:22 - really excited about future years where
12:24 - I get to pick pretty well all the
12:26 - classes I get to take and everything I'm
12:27 - taking is just genuinely interesting to
12:29 - me so I don't know that's kind of been a
12:31 - bit about computer science and how
12:33 - difficult it is I would say it's one of
12:35 - the more difficult degrees that being
12:37 - said if you guys are into it and you
12:38 - like it definitely pursue it don't be
12:41 - intimidated by some of the math and some
12:43 - of the other things if you work hard
12:44 - enough and you actually just do the
12:46 - practice that's all it comes down to you
12:48 - will succeed and you will do well and
12:50 - that's the biggest thing I see in school
12:53 - in general honestly I know it's what
12:55 - everyone says but if you put the work in
12:57 - you will see the results anyways guys
12:59 - that's been it for me I'd love to hear
13:01 - what you guys think about this in your
13:02 - opinion on computer science difficulty
13:04 - all that in the comments below so let me
13:07 - know
13:07 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be talking to you guys about how difficult computer science is now if you're subscribed to my channel you'll know that I'm 18 and I'm just about finished my first year of computer science so actually live in Canada and I'm going to a university in Ontario where I'm majoring in computer science and I believe my exact program is honors computer science coop and then I'm actually in the entrepreneur and business stream which means is I take one or two business electives each year and then when I graduate I get that extra little tag on my diploma saying that I likes did entrepreneurship so that's the exact program that I'm in what I'm gonna do in this video is I'm gonna start by just explaining a bit about computer science in general what it really is what you're taking in University and then I'm gonna go through my firstyear courses I'm gonna show you guys the averages for those classes my average for those classes and kind of explain why maybe some courses are more difficult than others or which ones are more difficult so you guys get an exact idea of what it's like rather than me just saying no it's not hard or yes it's hard okay so if you guys want to see exactly how I did in all my computer science classes make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video I feel like some of you guys might be interested in that so anyways alright so what I'm gonna do now is just talk in general about what is computer science a lot of people don't actually really know what computer science is before taking it and going into university now essentially what it is is it's not being a programmer a lot of people think computer science are just writing tons of lines of code and just being really good at coding yes obviously that's an aspect to it but it's really focused around efficiency algorithms design the ways that computer work and knowing these things allows you to write much better code so at the end of the day yes it comes down to writing really good code for your assignments and your projects and having good flowing programs but it's also really about the way that you approach problems the way that you think about things designing algorithms and if you graduate with the computer science degree that means you can take those skills to any different kind of program language it's not just like oh you're really good at Java programming yeah you might be but if you have the computer science fundamentals like you know a lot about algorithms or you know how to approach a problem or maybe you're good at machine learning then you can do that in any language and all that's gonna differ is the syntax and the words in that language that you're using okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go through my different courses I have to take five courses per semester I'm in my second semester right now so let's start with first semester go through which courses I took and the averages and how I did in those classes so the first course I had to take was calculus one now calculus one I have to look at my transcript here because I always forget and I'll pop it up on the screen I go out in a in calculus one which translates to a 9.0 out of ten point on a GPA scale you guys can convert that to like a 4.0 scale if that's what you use the class average for that was a 5.4 3 GPA which is sitting around 60 to 65% so you can tell that most people that took that that actually finished the class because this is not account for the people that dropped out of it didn't do amazing and a lot of people found it difficult now I would say Kelley this one is probably one of the hardest firstyear classes and that is just because it's just difficult a lot of the math that you have to do you're dealing with integrals with least that's what I'm doing that you might might be different curriculum and whatever school you're going to and it's kind of a big step up and it requires a lot of practice if you are not constantly practicing and doing your homework you are not gonna do well in that class and I think a lot of people are used to high school like I was where you just go in I don't maybe did a few practice questions before the tests or whatever and you're just fine this if you haven't been practicing like every after each lecture you're probably not gonna do well and I think that's why a lot of people found it very difficult because it just requires a lot of practice ok so the next class I had to take was introduction to linear algebra now this just sounds intimidating when you hear linear algebra you're kind of like okay Wow like what is linear algebra is a difficult class but it is not like crazy difficult so I finished that finished that class with an aminus which is like I think it's like 80 to 85% and the class average for that was five point one six GPA out of ten we again equates to about a 60% so a lot of people found that class very difficult and in fact I think actually like 35 percent of my class dropped out for making it to the exam because they didn't want that like F or the fail on their transcript and they already did horribly on the midterms so yeah so anyways a lot of people find that cost difficult because it deals with really abstract concepts the actual math that you perform is not hard by any means in fact I'd say that if you know like grade 9 or 10 math you're able to complete almost any like math equation or anything that it needs you to do in that class it's just a really abstract concept you're dealing with matrixes and multiple dimensions and a lot of people get caught up in the fact that you can't really visualize what you're doing for example if you're dealing with a 12 dimensional matrix you can't like you can't visualize what that looks like you used to three dimensional math with up to three variables X Y Z and now you're dealing with like 10 15 20 infinite amount of dimensions and a lot of people just get really confused and let that kind of I don't know distract them from how to do the math so the next class I was in was introduction to computing one this class is an absolute joke you've done anything with computer science like I mean like you've just written any kind of Python you've written any code like you can consider yourself a beginner you will be far ahead in this class they have to teach you like introduction clock they have to do like an introduction programming class and make it mandatory because they have to make assume that everyone knows nothing about programming going into University because a lot of high schools don't offer programming so they kind of teach it like from the very beginning which means if you've done anything with that you you'll be fine so you guys already imagined I got an A+ in that class I pretty well teach this class on my youtube channel and it was just it's just an absolute joke so if you have done anything with programming don't worry about your first year computing classes they're gonna be a breeze ok next class I was in was engineering economics and technical report writing now these two so technical report writing it was required some in the Faculty of engineering so I have to take that class that class is super easy as well it's just like really basic grammar and how to structure reports and do documents I hate the class it's boring I hate writing but I got an A in it it's really easy class average for that was 7 y41 like that's a highclass outrage for university so that means most people go like a 75 okay next one engineering economics I got an A+ in this this is a elective class I chose to take this likely you won't have to take any class like that you'll get to pick I don't know enjoyed that class and just taught a bit about business so I haven't yet finished these classes obviously but I kind of have an idea of their difficulty level so let's start by talking about introduction to computing so introduction to computing is a massive step up from introduction to computing one and it is taught in Java so the other one I think I mentioned was taught in Python this one is taught in Java so being taught in Java it means already the language is bit more difficult to use and they don't actually teach any of the syntax they just tell you like we're gonna continue learning about computer science concepts with the language Java not like we're teaching you Java just we're using Java to teach you concepts if that makes sense to you guys so I what we've done in this class so far and I haven't found it very difficult I got 96 on the midterm that I wrote a few days ago is like polymorphism inheritance what do you call it interfaces that's the word I'm okay interfaces I don't know why I couldn't remember that and then they have stuff like what do you do next acts queues just really like basic stuff we dealt with generics I don't know if you guys know what that is but nothing crazy difficult not by the end of the year we're doing some like graphical user interface stuff we're doing a few other like different kind of algorithms binary search trees just really fundamental computer science concepts that aren't crazy difficult but you know you do kind of have to practice them a little bit so that computing to class is a step up obviously from competing one but by no means what I say it's very difficult and you know if you're into programming it's almost like you kind of just enjoy doing it like I genuinely enjoy doing a lot of the work for that class and I'm it that being said I don't really consider it work right ok so next class I have to take and you will likely have to take as well is discrete math for computing this class is difficult um I'm doing ok in this class right now but it is it's just very weird it's nothing like you've ever done before it deals with set theory it deals with proving like formulas proving like you just do proofs like you have to prove that something equals something which seems like it just just difficult I need in like truth tables and basic logics like and or not but kind of with some weird like more difficult than I'm just explaining right there it's not class is difficult I can't tell you obviously with the class averages because I'm not finished yet but I'd assume it'll be fairly low next class digital systems this class is actually super interesting and it deals with really low level logic on how a computer actually works and it deals with like an gates nor gates Nan's latches memory if you guys know what any of that means then you know what it means but anyways it just deals with like really lowlevel logic which is really interesting and kind of gives you a different perspective on how computers work it is a bit of a difficult class but it's not it's not that hard if you practice and you actually read like a lot of the notes and whatnot take notes go to class it's not a nothing too crazy and finally the two other classes that I'm doing this semester are actually have to look cuz why do I forget what ones I'm doing that's probably not good calculus too yeah so calculus 2 is I would actually argue easier than calculus 1 you do need calculus 1 to be able to do calculus 2 I mean it makes sense 1 2 but the concepts are just simpler I would say and if you do the practice really calculus and math like that it's just practice practice practice it's not difficult at all and you can definitely get you can easily get 100 in that class if you just continually did the practice but that being said I mean most people don't do that so a lot of people do struggle with that next one I'm in is I have to look on here again Oh introduction to business management so again I know time in this entrepreneurship stream so I have to take some business electives this class I mean it's not really you guys probably aren't gonna have to take it it's pretty interesting it just kind of talks about you know we call it management what I say did I say business management yeah ok so it talks about management and just how to be a good manager in different aspects to look at in business and you know kind of from like an engineering like science perspective side to go into a class like that is interesting and just kind of hear some different perspectives and see different ways that people think because I think very logically and linear as opposed to like creatively and outofthebox which can be an advantage or a disadvantage so it's nice to kind of get some different perspective and take it different kind of class so anyways that has kind of been it about computer science I apologize for this video being so long but I wanted to give you guys a really good indepth kind of look at to what you're gonna have to take a little summary about each of them not too much but not too little how the class does an average on those how I do in my opinion on it so just to wrap up here computer science if you guys are into computer science and you actually like what you're doing first year it might sound difficult it might sound intimidating but what they try to do is they try to actually flush out all the students that can't handle it in first year personally in my program the reason why there's so many required math classes in first year is because once you get to second year third year fourth year they want to make sure the students that are there are serious about the degree that they're taking and a lot of people jump into computer science without any programming knowledge without any idea really what it is and when they get into first year they see all these hard courses and they just kind of jump ship or they change programs and I know actually a lot of people that have done that or that are thinking about doing that so they give you all these hard math classes to kind of flush out the people that you know don't really know what they're doing or don't want to be there and then in the next year's everything gets a lot better because you just get so much more freedom and selection in what you get to choose and I don't know personally I'm really excited about future years where I get to pick pretty well all the classes I get to take and everything I'm taking is just genuinely interesting to me so I don't know that's kind of been a bit about computer science and how difficult it is I would say it's one of the more difficult degrees that being said if you guys are into it and you like it definitely pursue it don't be intimidated by some of the math and some of the other things if you work hard enough and you actually just do the practice that's all it comes down to you will succeed and you will do well and that's the biggest thing I see in school in general honestly I know it's what everyone says but if you put the work in you will see the results anyways guys that's been it for me I'd love to hear what you guys think about this in your opinion on computer science difficulty all that in the comments below so let me know
