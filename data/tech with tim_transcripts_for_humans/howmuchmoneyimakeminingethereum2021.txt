00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna talk to you about how much my
00:15 - ethereum mining rig makes now also go
00:18 - through the specs of the rig show you a
00:20 - few photos of it talk about how i set it
00:22 - up in my house and some of the obstacles
00:24 - i faced when i did that then of course
00:26 - i'll go through the profitability so how
00:28 - much it makes how much the expenses are
00:30 - so in terms of power and electricity and
00:32 - all that kind of stuff
00:34 - finally i can actually show you my
00:36 - ethereum mining dashboard and you can
00:38 - see all of the overclocks that i've done
00:40 - and the software that i use to control
00:42 - my rig anyways let's go ahead and get
00:44 - started and i will talk to you about how
00:46 - much this rig makes but i do need to
00:47 - mention that something else that makes
00:49 - me money is the sponsor of this video
00:51 - before we get started i need to thank

01:27 - feature i can highly recommend algo
01:29 - expert as a former customer myself and
01:31 - now an official instructor on the
01:33 - platform get started using algo expert
01:35 - today by clicking the link in the
01:37 - description and using the code tech with
01:38 - tim for a discount on the platform all
01:41 - right so the first thing i'm going to do
01:42 - here is just tell you a bit of a story
01:44 - of how i actually acquired this mining
01:46 - rick so it was back in april of 2021 so
01:49 - about six months ago from today and one
01:52 - of my friends approached me he knew i
01:53 - had some experience with cryptocurrency
01:55 - and with mining in the past and he said
01:57 - hey i'm looking into buying an ethereum
01:59 - mining rig would you potentially want to
02:01 - join me do you want to get your own rig
02:02 - do you want to maybe split one with me
02:04 - either way the more money we can spend
02:06 - the more we can likely save because
02:08 - we'll get some type of bulk discounter
02:10 - deal or combo deal or something along
02:12 - those lines
02:13 - anyways i end up saying yes i end up
02:15 - figuring out that i can actually buy
02:16 - this in my business which means that i
02:18 - can depreciate the rig and that's really
02:20 - good means i can save probably actually
02:22 - a few thousand bucks over the lifespan
02:24 - of this rig and so i go ahead and you
02:26 - know buy a mining rig with him
02:28 - now what we do is we go on kijiji we
02:30 - look at the different prices of graphics
02:32 - cards and originally we're planning on
02:34 - just building the rig ourself i know how
02:36 - to build computers i have lots of
02:37 - experience doing this and building
02:39 - mining rigs in the past as well in fact
02:42 - quick tangent here back at the beginning
02:44 - of this channel so probably in like 2015
02:46 - or 2016 this whole channel tech with tim
02:49 - was completely about cryptocurrency in
02:51 - fact you can probably find some old
02:53 - videos on this channel where i discuss
02:54 - cryptocurrency stuff so anyways just to
02:57 - you know prove the point i used to mine
02:59 - back when i was like 15 and 16 and so i
03:01 - was kind of excited to get back into
03:03 - that space because while i was at
03:04 - university and in shared living places i
03:06 - couldn't really have a mining rig but
03:08 - now that i'm in my own house it actually
03:10 - makes sense and i have a place where i
03:11 - can set it up so anyways we going kijiji
03:14 - we end up realizing that it's probably
03:16 - just going to be better to pay someone
03:17 - to make the rig for us they can go out
03:19 - they can find all the cards they can
03:20 - waste their time doing that we don't
03:22 - have to actually go and try to acquire
03:24 - like all of these different graphics
03:26 - cards which are really hard to find and
03:28 - this guy has all the other parts he's
03:29 - built you know tons of rigs he'll set up
03:31 - all the software for us and the time
03:33 - save was just definitely worth it so we
03:35 - find a guy in kijiji uh he builds rigs
03:37 - to order so what we actually have to do
03:39 - is tell him the type of rig that we want
03:41 - and he goes out and buys all the parts
03:42 - and then once it's ready he gives it to
03:44 - us we verify that he's legit and we both
03:47 - order a four times 30 80 rig from him so
03:50 - just a rig that has four 30 80 graphics
03:52 - cards in it and this rig he quotes us
03:55 - for 13 200
03:57 - so each of us are getting one of these
03:58 - so in total our order is 26 400
04:01 - this guy's completely legit he did a
04:03 - really really good job on building the
04:05 - rig we go pick it up from him
04:07 - bring it back home everything works
04:09 - everything went really smoothly and so
04:11 - yeah we were happy we had the rig and
04:12 - this is again like april 2021 so about
04:15 - two weeks later we both end up actually
04:17 - adding to the rig so i added a 30 70 to
04:20 - the rig this cost me about 1700
04:22 - and so my rig now is about 14 900
04:25 - canadian dollars i need to specify that
04:27 - everything that i'm talking about in
04:28 - this video is canadian dollars i live
04:30 - kind of in like the toronto area so that
04:33 - gives you a bit of context there okay
04:35 - regardless we get the rig set up
04:37 - everything's working and in terms of the
04:39 - setup what i did originally was i just
04:42 - put it in my basement so i have a spare
04:43 - room in my basement it's pretty large i
04:45 - leave the door open in there and the
04:47 - reason that's an important note that the
04:49 - door is open is because these rigs
04:51 - especially the ones with the higher end
04:52 - graphics cards like the 3080s or the
04:54 - 3090s generate a ton of heat like a
04:58 - ridiculous amount of heat if you go in
05:00 - the room where my mining rig is and i'll
05:01 - show you some photos on the screen here
05:03 - it's probably four to five degrees
05:05 - warmer than the rest of my house like no
05:07 - joke it's that warm and in fact in the
05:09 - kind of winter months so i guess april
05:11 - was still a little bit cold here it was
05:13 - actually kind of heating the basement
05:14 - for me and i guess you could say it was
05:16 - maybe saving me a little bit on heat but
05:19 - anyways point being it just is really
05:21 - really hot so that's an important
05:22 - consideration
05:23 - anyways in terms of the setup the first
05:25 - thing i needed to figure out was where i
05:26 - was going to put it so i did that i put
05:28 - in the spare room and then the second
05:29 - thing was how i was going to get
05:30 - internet to it
05:32 - so fortunately when i had moved into my
05:34 - house and i just moved in and marched
05:36 - about a month before i got this rig i'd
05:38 - actually pre-ran a cat6 cable to this
05:40 - room now i use this cat6 cable or was
05:43 - using this cat6 cable to run an access
05:45 - point so i have an access point that i
05:47 - keep in the spare bedroom in my basement
05:49 - and so i only had one cable going there
05:51 - and it was being used on the access
05:52 - point but i knew that what i could do is
05:54 - just run that cable into a switch and
05:56 - then i could have two outputs coming out
05:58 - of the switch run one to the rig run one
06:00 - to the access point and i was all good
06:02 - hence why you're going to see this kind
06:03 - of like really jank wiring going on if
06:06 - those photos are showing up on the
06:07 - screen right now
06:09 - all right so that was problem two
06:10 - relatively easy fix in getting internet
06:12 - to the rig but then the third problem
06:14 - that i had was i wasn't sure if i was
06:16 - gonna have enough power in the area that
06:18 - i needed it so you might be a little bit
06:20 - confused by this but the rig that i have
06:23 - has a thousand watt and 850 watt power
06:25 - supply in it and under peak load the
06:28 - combined usage of the two power supplies
06:30 - is about 1300 watts and so that means
06:33 - that i can just barely get away with
06:35 - having a 15 amp circuit or using a
06:38 - single 15 amp circuit for this rig
06:41 - so let me clarify here in canada the
06:43 - standard circuits that are ran in your
06:44 - house are 15 amps which means you can do
06:46 - about 1500 watts a little bit less than
06:49 - that if you don't want to have the uh i
06:51 - guess what he called the breaker trip in
06:52 - your circuit panel but i wasn't sure if
06:55 - what was ran to that room was a
06:56 - dedicated circuit or not so if this was
06:59 - not a dedicated circuit what that would
07:00 - mean is that there might be other
07:02 - outlets in my house that are sharing the
07:03 - same 1500 watt maximum load and so i
07:06 - might have say four outlets all using
07:08 - the same circuit and so if my mining rig
07:10 - is plugged in and using 1300 watts and
07:13 - then i plug in something like a blender
07:14 - or i plug in something like a subwoofer
07:17 - that could fully trip the breaker and
07:19 - well that would be bad you wouldn't want
07:20 - to do that so i was fortunate that the
07:22 - outlet i had ran to that room actually
07:24 - was on a dedicated circuit this was here
07:26 - before i moved into the house so i
07:27 - wasn't sure and so when i plugged it in
07:30 - everything just worked all was good i
07:32 - was very happy because that meant i
07:33 - didn't have to do custom electrical work
07:35 - and run a 20 amp circuit to that room or
07:38 - just a dedicated circuit
07:39 - anyways point being that was all good
07:42 - very happy about that fingers crossed
07:43 - that everything is going to continue to
07:45 - work there but then what happened one
07:47 - day actually when i was live streaming
07:48 - some of you may have seen this happen is
07:50 - there was a power surge in my house and
07:52 - one of my power supplies actually blew
07:54 - up now it wasn't like a violent like
07:56 - explosion in my basement but i heard it
07:58 - and there was a capacitor that exploded
08:00 - inside of the power supply and so it
08:02 - completely ruined
08:04 - that power supply just was not usable
08:06 - anymore so i aura made it ended up
08:08 - getting a new one and then plugged in
08:10 - the new power supply and since then it's
08:11 - been good
08:12 - but because that happened i was really
08:14 - concerned that could potentially happen
08:15 - again so i went out and i bought two ups
08:18 - now a ups is an uninterruptible power
08:20 - supply i use them pretty much everywhere
08:23 - in my house i think i have like seven or
08:24 - eight of them here and the point of
08:26 - having the ups
08:27 - is that it's a battery backup and a
08:30 - surge protector for whatever you have
08:31 - plugged into it so each ups i bought was
08:34 - about 200 bucks so add maybe 400 bucks
08:36 - to the cost of my rig if you're
08:38 - including the ups's in it and they
08:40 - support 900 watts so that's why i had to
08:42 - get two of them because i couldn't find
08:44 - one that was affordable that was gonna
08:45 - do the entire rig anyways i get two
08:47 - ups's and the point of the ups is that
08:49 - it's a surge protector and battery
08:51 - backup so if the power does go out or
08:53 - does surge the battery and the ups will
08:56 - be able to support the rig for probably
08:57 - about 20 to 30 minutes and hopefully
08:59 - that's enough time for the power to be
09:01 - restored so anyways that is the general
09:02 - setup of my rig again i have it in this
09:04 - basement bedroom it has lots of airflow
09:07 - in there i have a bunch of fans
09:08 - connected to the rig too to make sure
09:10 - that the cards stay nice and cool i have
09:12 - all of the cards overclocked which i'll
09:13 - talk about in a minute and to summarize
09:16 - i have five cards i have four 30 80s one
09:19 - 30 70. the other components are not
09:21 - super important i have 1000 watt power
09:23 - supply one 850 watt power supply it's on
09:26 - a custom built frame so the guy that we
09:28 - bought the rig from actually designed
09:30 - and built that frame for us and then we
09:32 - have like a dual core processor four
09:35 - gigabytes of ram
09:36 - some motherboard that has six pci slots
09:39 - to support up to six graphics cards and
09:42 - one random ssd like a crappy shitty ssd
09:45 - that you use to run the operating system
09:46 - on
09:47 - so that is the setup hopefully that was
09:49 - not too long and you guys got the idea
09:51 - there and can see some of the photos but
09:53 - now let me actually head over to my
09:55 - dashboard i will show you how much money
09:57 - this rig has made me and then talk about
09:59 - some of the expenses with it all right
10:01 - so i'm actually in my hive os software
10:03 - here or hiveos dashboard which i'm going
10:05 - to talk about now i was going to do that
10:06 - later but i figured we'd just skip to it
10:08 - now so the software or the operating
10:11 - system that i use on my mining rig is
10:13 - called hive os this is free and what
10:16 - this allows you to do is actually
10:17 - control all of your rigs remotely from
10:20 - the web so right now i'm just on a
10:21 - website it's called hive os okay i've
10:23 - signed into my account and you can see
10:25 - here that i have one mining rig it's
10:27 - called four times rtx 3080. it actually
10:29 - has five gpus as you can see up top here
10:33 - but originally before i added the other
10:34 - gpu i called it this and i just didn't
10:36 - change the name
10:37 - point being though you can see we're
10:38 - hashing at about 449.3
10:41 - mega hashes per second i have about
10:44 - almost 1300 watts being used so 1.277
10:47 - kilowatts so that's about 1 300 watts
10:49 - and you can see the price per day in
10:51 - electricity is about 3 and 12 cents
10:54 - u.s so the figures you're going to see
10:56 - here are us but all of the figures i
10:58 - discussed previously were canadian
11:00 - it's annoying in canada we use canadian
11:02 - dollars and then everything shows up in
11:03 - us but
11:04 - you get the idea so there you go you can
11:06 - read through this i have five gpus this
11:08 - is my actual rig and this is called a
11:10 - worker so if i click into this worker
11:12 - here
11:12 - you can see we have all the graphics
11:14 - cards it shows what all of the cards are
11:16 - hashing at so my 30 80s are going at
11:18 - about 96
11:19 - and my 30 70 is going at about 61. now
11:22 - if you're curious you can see what the
11:24 - fan speed and all of the overclocks are
11:26 - so we actually undervolt the core clock
11:29 - by negative 225 overclock the memory
11:31 - clock to 1800
11:33 - and then the power limit is set at 230
11:35 - watts for each 3080 and 130 for the 30
11:38 - 70. now you can also look at the load
11:41 - average of the physical computer itself
11:43 - so how much free space the free ram all
11:45 - of that kind of stuff not super
11:47 - important but yes this is the rig
11:50 - now i'm mining using something called
11:51 - the hive on pool
11:53 - now that is not super important but you
11:55 - can see my effective hash rate is 449.3
11:58 - sorry not effective average hash rate is
12:00 - 449.3
12:02 - uh and my effective hashrate is whatever
12:04 - is here and that will be changing as you
12:06 - know random things happen with the
12:08 - network
12:09 - okay so that's kind of the basics i mean
12:11 - there's not much more to go through here
12:13 - i could do a whole video on the software
12:15 - you can see there's all kinds of
12:16 - controls up here like i can change the
12:18 - fans i have this hash rate watchdog
12:20 - which means if the hash rate goes below
12:22 - a certain number it will actually
12:23 - restart the computer for me i can remote
12:25 - access i can look at power options so i
12:28 - could you know reboot shutdown whatever
12:32 - all this kind of stuff
12:33 - not super important not the point of the
12:34 - video but there you go okay so that is
12:38 - that now let's go and look at my
12:40 - profitability here which i think i can
12:42 - do by clicking on hive on pool all right
12:44 - so i'm here on my hive on dashboard this
12:47 - is where it actually shows how much
12:48 - money the rig has made now you can see
12:51 - here right away if we look at the
12:52 - numbers about 30 bucks a day but 215 us
12:55 - dollars a week and so far i have been
12:57 - paid about 7 200 us dollars now of
13:00 - course you want to convert this to
13:01 - canadian dollars to compare against the
13:03 - prices i gave you before but i do need
13:05 - to mention that these numbers are highly
13:07 - dependent on the price of ethereum in
13:09 - fact you should really probably only
13:11 - look at how much ethereum i've made
13:13 - because ethereum price changes all the
13:15 - time and so this number here tomorrow
13:17 - could be a lot more it could be a lot
13:19 - less so really you just want to look at
13:20 - the amount of ethereum which is almost
13:22 - to a theorem about 1.9 ethereum and this
13:24 - again is in a time frame of about six
13:27 - months okay
13:28 - so that should give you an idea now i
13:30 - will say that i've seen this number
13:32 - so for the daily earnings be about 50 us
13:35 - dollars that's the highest i've seen it
13:37 - and the lowest i've seen it has been
13:38 - probably
13:39 - 17 18 bucks now in all of these numbers
13:42 - you do need to factor in the price of
13:43 - electricity which is three dollars and
13:46 - 12 cents us that's what it's
13:48 - approximating it at it's probably a
13:49 - little bit higher than that because
13:51 - where i am electricity is pretty
13:52 - expensive but that is kind of the idea
13:56 - so really not much more i can say than
13:58 - that i will leave you by mentioning that
14:01 - you might be thinking that i'm losing
14:02 - money right now you might be looking at
14:04 - this and saying okay you've made about
14:06 - let's say 9 500 canadian dollars if you
14:08 - do the exchange rate maybe a bit less
14:10 - than that
14:11 - you paid about 15 500 if you factor in
14:14 - the ups's and so you are down right now
14:16 - about six thousand canadian dollars
14:19 - okay if you're looking at it only in
14:20 - that sense yes i guess i would be down
14:23 - six thousand dollars but you have to
14:25 - remember that my ethereum mining rig is
14:27 - still worth something so even though i
14:29 - paid for it fifteen thousand dollars
14:32 - right now if i were to sell it i could
14:34 - probably sell it for about thirteen or
14:35 - fourteen thousand dollars and so all i
14:37 - actually have to do whenever i'm mining
14:40 - ethereum and i have that rig is i have
14:41 - to make the difference in depreciation
14:44 - that's all i have to do and if you want
14:46 - to factor in inflation as well you can
14:47 - do that but the point is that if i
14:49 - simply beat the depreciation of my
14:50 - mining rig then i'm going to be
14:52 - generating some type of profit because
14:54 - the mining rig still has value and i can
14:56 - always sell it if i want to i'm not
14:58 - planning on selling the mining rig i
15:00 - would really like to you know break even
15:01 - by making that amount of ethereum but
15:03 - the point is that this is a very safe
15:05 - investment because of that let's say
15:07 - ethereum tanks in value and all of a
15:09 - sudden this is worth nothing okay that's
15:11 - fine i'll just go sell my mining rig
15:13 - i'll probably still make money because
15:14 - ethereum's probably not going to be to
15:17 - the point where 1.9 ethereum is worth
15:19 - less than you know 2 000 canadian
15:20 - dollars that would be pretty ridiculous
15:23 - and so hopefully that gives you kind of
15:24 - an idea of the business strategy here
15:26 - i'm pretty well guaranteed to just kind
15:28 - of win so long as i can continue mining
15:30 - ethereum and the value of ethereum is
15:33 - not going to tank to literally nothing
15:36 - all right so with that said that's

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna talk to you about how much my ethereum mining rig makes now also go through the specs of the rig show you a few photos of it talk about how i set it up in my house and some of the obstacles i faced when i did that then of course i'll go through the profitability so how much it makes how much the expenses are so in terms of power and electricity and all that kind of stuff finally i can actually show you my ethereum mining dashboard and you can see all of the overclocks that i've done and the software that i use to control my rig anyways let's go ahead and get started and i will talk to you about how much this rig makes but i do need to mention that something else that makes me money is the sponsor of this video before we get started i need to thank the sponsor of this video which is alcoexpert algo expert is the best platform to use from preparing for your software engineering coding interviews

get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so the first thing i'm going to do here is just tell you a bit of a story of how i actually acquired this mining rick so it was back in april of 2021 so about six months ago from today and one of my friends approached me he knew i had some experience with cryptocurrency and with mining in the past and he said hey i'm looking into buying an ethereum mining rig would you potentially want to join me do you want to get your own rig do you want to maybe split one with me either way the more money we can spend the more we can likely save because we'll get some type of bulk discounter deal or combo deal or something along those lines anyways i end up saying yes i end up figuring out that i can actually buy this in my business which means that i can depreciate the rig and that's really good means i can save probably actually a few thousand bucks over the lifespan of this rig and so i go ahead and you know buy a mining rig with him now what we do is we go on kijiji we look at the different prices of graphics cards and originally we're planning on just building the rig ourself i know how to build computers i have lots of experience doing this and building mining rigs in the past as well in fact quick tangent here back at the beginning of this channel so probably in like 2015 or 2016 this whole channel tech with tim was completely about cryptocurrency in fact you can probably find some old videos on this channel where i discuss cryptocurrency stuff so anyways just to you know prove the point i used to mine back when i was like 15 and 16 and so i was kind of excited to get back into that space because while i was at university and in shared living places i couldn't really have a mining rig but now that i'm in my own house it actually makes sense and i have a place where i can set it up so anyways we going kijiji we end up realizing that it's probably just going to be better to pay someone to make the rig for us they can go out they can find all the cards they can waste their time doing that we don't have to actually go and try to acquire like all of these different graphics cards which are really hard to find and this guy has all the other parts he's built you know tons of rigs he'll set up all the software for us and the time save was just definitely worth it so we find a guy in kijiji uh he builds rigs to order so what we actually have to do is tell him the type of rig that we want and he goes out and buys all the parts and then once it's ready he gives it to us we verify that he's legit and we both order a four times 30 80 rig from him so just a rig that has four 30 80 graphics cards in it and this rig he quotes us for 13 200 so each of us are getting one of these so in total our order is 26 400 this guy's completely legit he did a really really good job on building the rig we go pick it up from him bring it back home everything works everything went really smoothly and so yeah we were happy we had the rig and this is again like april 2021 so about two weeks later we both end up actually adding to the rig so i added a 30 70 to the rig this cost me about 1700 and so my rig now is about 14 900 canadian dollars i need to specify that everything that i'm talking about in this video is canadian dollars i live kind of in like the toronto area so that gives you a bit of context there okay regardless we get the rig set up everything's working and in terms of the setup what i did originally was i just put it in my basement so i have a spare room in my basement it's pretty large i leave the door open in there and the reason that's an important note that the door is open is because these rigs especially the ones with the higher end graphics cards like the 3080s or the 3090s generate a ton of heat like a ridiculous amount of heat if you go in the room where my mining rig is and i'll show you some photos on the screen here it's probably four to five degrees warmer than the rest of my house like no joke it's that warm and in fact in the kind of winter months so i guess april was still a little bit cold here it was actually kind of heating the basement for me and i guess you could say it was maybe saving me a little bit on heat but anyways point being it just is really really hot so that's an important consideration anyways in terms of the setup the first thing i needed to figure out was where i was going to put it so i did that i put in the spare room and then the second thing was how i was going to get internet to it so fortunately when i had moved into my house and i just moved in and marched about a month before i got this rig i'd actually preran a cat6 cable to this room now i use this cat6 cable or was using this cat6 cable to run an access point so i have an access point that i keep in the spare bedroom in my basement and so i only had one cable going there and it was being used on the access point but i knew that what i could do is just run that cable into a switch and then i could have two outputs coming out of the switch run one to the rig run one to the access point and i was all good hence why you're going to see this kind of like really jank wiring going on if those photos are showing up on the screen right now all right so that was problem two relatively easy fix in getting internet to the rig but then the third problem that i had was i wasn't sure if i was gonna have enough power in the area that i needed it so you might be a little bit confused by this but the rig that i have has a thousand watt and 850 watt power supply in it and under peak load the combined usage of the two power supplies is about 1300 watts and so that means that i can just barely get away with having a 15 amp circuit or using a single 15 amp circuit for this rig so let me clarify here in canada the standard circuits that are ran in your house are 15 amps which means you can do about 1500 watts a little bit less than that if you don't want to have the uh i guess what he called the breaker trip in your circuit panel but i wasn't sure if what was ran to that room was a dedicated circuit or not so if this was not a dedicated circuit what that would mean is that there might be other outlets in my house that are sharing the same 1500 watt maximum load and so i might have say four outlets all using the same circuit and so if my mining rig is plugged in and using 1300 watts and then i plug in something like a blender or i plug in something like a subwoofer that could fully trip the breaker and well that would be bad you wouldn't want to do that so i was fortunate that the outlet i had ran to that room actually was on a dedicated circuit this was here before i moved into the house so i wasn't sure and so when i plugged it in everything just worked all was good i was very happy because that meant i didn't have to do custom electrical work and run a 20 amp circuit to that room or just a dedicated circuit anyways point being that was all good very happy about that fingers crossed that everything is going to continue to work there but then what happened one day actually when i was live streaming some of you may have seen this happen is there was a power surge in my house and one of my power supplies actually blew up now it wasn't like a violent like explosion in my basement but i heard it and there was a capacitor that exploded inside of the power supply and so it completely ruined that power supply just was not usable anymore so i aura made it ended up getting a new one and then plugged in the new power supply and since then it's been good but because that happened i was really concerned that could potentially happen again so i went out and i bought two ups now a ups is an uninterruptible power supply i use them pretty much everywhere in my house i think i have like seven or eight of them here and the point of having the ups is that it's a battery backup and a surge protector for whatever you have plugged into it so each ups i bought was about 200 bucks so add maybe 400 bucks to the cost of my rig if you're including the ups's in it and they support 900 watts so that's why i had to get two of them because i couldn't find one that was affordable that was gonna do the entire rig anyways i get two ups's and the point of the ups is that it's a surge protector and battery backup so if the power does go out or does surge the battery and the ups will be able to support the rig for probably about 20 to 30 minutes and hopefully that's enough time for the power to be restored so anyways that is the general setup of my rig again i have it in this basement bedroom it has lots of airflow in there i have a bunch of fans connected to the rig too to make sure that the cards stay nice and cool i have all of the cards overclocked which i'll talk about in a minute and to summarize i have five cards i have four 30 80s one 30 70. the other components are not super important i have 1000 watt power supply one 850 watt power supply it's on a custom built frame so the guy that we bought the rig from actually designed and built that frame for us and then we have like a dual core processor four gigabytes of ram some motherboard that has six pci slots to support up to six graphics cards and one random ssd like a crappy shitty ssd that you use to run the operating system on so that is the setup hopefully that was not too long and you guys got the idea there and can see some of the photos but now let me actually head over to my dashboard i will show you how much money this rig has made me and then talk about some of the expenses with it all right so i'm actually in my hive os software here or hiveos dashboard which i'm going to talk about now i was going to do that later but i figured we'd just skip to it now so the software or the operating system that i use on my mining rig is called hive os this is free and what this allows you to do is actually control all of your rigs remotely from the web so right now i'm just on a website it's called hive os okay i've signed into my account and you can see here that i have one mining rig it's called four times rtx 3080. it actually has five gpus as you can see up top here but originally before i added the other gpu i called it this and i just didn't change the name point being though you can see we're hashing at about 449.3 mega hashes per second i have about almost 1300 watts being used so 1.277 kilowatts so that's about 1 300 watts and you can see the price per day in electricity is about 3 and 12 cents u.s so the figures you're going to see here are us but all of the figures i discussed previously were canadian it's annoying in canada we use canadian dollars and then everything shows up in us but you get the idea so there you go you can read through this i have five gpus this is my actual rig and this is called a worker so if i click into this worker here you can see we have all the graphics cards it shows what all of the cards are hashing at so my 30 80s are going at about 96 and my 30 70 is going at about 61. now if you're curious you can see what the fan speed and all of the overclocks are so we actually undervolt the core clock by negative 225 overclock the memory clock to 1800 and then the power limit is set at 230 watts for each 3080 and 130 for the 30 70. now you can also look at the load average of the physical computer itself so how much free space the free ram all of that kind of stuff not super important but yes this is the rig now i'm mining using something called the hive on pool now that is not super important but you can see my effective hash rate is 449.3 sorry not effective average hash rate is 449.3 uh and my effective hashrate is whatever is here and that will be changing as you know random things happen with the network okay so that's kind of the basics i mean there's not much more to go through here i could do a whole video on the software you can see there's all kinds of controls up here like i can change the fans i have this hash rate watchdog which means if the hash rate goes below a certain number it will actually restart the computer for me i can remote access i can look at power options so i could you know reboot shutdown whatever all this kind of stuff not super important not the point of the video but there you go okay so that is that now let's go and look at my profitability here which i think i can do by clicking on hive on pool all right so i'm here on my hive on dashboard this is where it actually shows how much money the rig has made now you can see here right away if we look at the numbers about 30 bucks a day but 215 us dollars a week and so far i have been paid about 7 200 us dollars now of course you want to convert this to canadian dollars to compare against the prices i gave you before but i do need to mention that these numbers are highly dependent on the price of ethereum in fact you should really probably only look at how much ethereum i've made because ethereum price changes all the time and so this number here tomorrow could be a lot more it could be a lot less so really you just want to look at the amount of ethereum which is almost to a theorem about 1.9 ethereum and this again is in a time frame of about six months okay so that should give you an idea now i will say that i've seen this number so for the daily earnings be about 50 us dollars that's the highest i've seen it and the lowest i've seen it has been probably 17 18 bucks now in all of these numbers you do need to factor in the price of electricity which is three dollars and 12 cents us that's what it's approximating it at it's probably a little bit higher than that because where i am electricity is pretty expensive but that is kind of the idea so really not much more i can say than that i will leave you by mentioning that you might be thinking that i'm losing money right now you might be looking at this and saying okay you've made about let's say 9 500 canadian dollars if you do the exchange rate maybe a bit less than that you paid about 15 500 if you factor in the ups's and so you are down right now about six thousand canadian dollars okay if you're looking at it only in that sense yes i guess i would be down six thousand dollars but you have to remember that my ethereum mining rig is still worth something so even though i paid for it fifteen thousand dollars right now if i were to sell it i could probably sell it for about thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars and so all i actually have to do whenever i'm mining ethereum and i have that rig is i have to make the difference in depreciation that's all i have to do and if you want to factor in inflation as well you can do that but the point is that if i simply beat the depreciation of my mining rig then i'm going to be generating some type of profit because the mining rig still has value and i can always sell it if i want to i'm not planning on selling the mining rig i would really like to you know break even by making that amount of ethereum but the point is that this is a very safe investment because of that let's say ethereum tanks in value and all of a sudden this is worth nothing okay that's fine i'll just go sell my mining rig i'll probably still make money because ethereum's probably not going to be to the point where 1.9 ethereum is worth less than you know 2 000 canadian dollars that would be pretty ridiculous and so hopefully that gives you kind of an idea of the business strategy here i'm pretty well guaranteed to just kind of win so long as i can continue mining ethereum and the value of ethereum is not going to tank to literally nothing all right so with that said that's pretty much everything i had for this video i don't really make cryptocurrency videos uh very often anymore i used to do them all the time but if you guys like this type of content please do let me know by leaving a like leave a comment in the description and maybe i will make some more in the future with that said hopefully you enjoyed the video if you did make sure to subscribe to the channel i will see you in another one
