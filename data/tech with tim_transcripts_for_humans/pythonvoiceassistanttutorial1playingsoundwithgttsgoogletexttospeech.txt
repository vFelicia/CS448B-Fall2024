00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new tutorial series on a Python voice
00:04 - assistant now what we're gonna be doing
00:06 - is essentially creating a virtual slash
00:08 - voice assistant using Python the Google
00:11 - text-to-speech module and some other
00:12 - modules in Python like speech
00:14 - recognition and play sound now what
00:17 - we're going to be doing is aiming to you
00:18 - know ease our life a little bit by
00:20 - having this virtual assistant that we
00:22 - can speak to through our computer's
00:23 - microphone and then have some kind of
00:25 - output either on the computer screen or
00:27 - from the speaker's itself so anyways
00:29 - that is kind of how this is gonna work
00:31 - what I'm gonna be doing for this
00:32 - tutorial series is breaking everything
00:34 - into parts where each part is where I'm
00:36 - gonna implement a new feature of the
00:38 - virtual assistant I have a few ideas for
00:40 - things I'd like to do but if there's
00:41 - anything you want to see as a part of
00:42 - this virtual assistant like a feature or
00:44 - something that it can do leave a comment
00:46 - down below right now and let me know and
00:48 - whatever ones are liked the most or just
00:50 - that I like I will try to implement into
00:52 - the series as we can do a ton of stuff
00:54 - within this series and different things
00:56 - I'm thinking right now that we can have
00:58 - some kind of web scraping so it can you
01:00 - know you can ask you to question it can
01:02 - Google something find the answer I'm
01:03 - thinking we can get it to do some kind
01:05 - of automation for us like maybe we want
01:07 - to track expenses or something and we
01:09 - can tell it you know like oh I bought
01:10 - this today I logged in an Excel
01:12 - spreadsheet I don't know is it a few
01:13 - small ideas I have but let me know
01:16 - so today's what we're gonna be doing
01:17 - today is just getting some audio coming
01:19 - out of the computer so pretty much
01:21 - figuring out how to use Google
01:23 - text-to-speech as well as just
01:25 - installing some packages that we're
01:26 - gonna need so the first thing we're
01:28 - gonna do is open up a command prompt
01:29 - window you can do that by typing CMD in
01:31 - your window search bar here or I mean if
01:33 - you're on Linux and I assume you know to
01:35 - do this then what we're gonna do is use
01:37 - pimp which is package installer for
01:39 - Python to install a few different
01:41 - packages now I assume most of you are
01:43 - familiar with pip but if you're not just
01:45 - go ahead in your command prompt try to
01:47 - type in and hit enter and see if this
01:49 - works if you get some output that looks
01:50 - like this if you don't then it probably
01:53 - means you have an installed pip
01:54 - correctly and I have a video I'm going
01:56 - to leave a card suit in the top right
01:58 - hand corner on how to fix that it says
02:00 - how to install PI game but it'll tell
02:02 - you how to fix that so anyways we're
02:04 - gonna start installing some packages so
02:05 - the first one we're gonna use is gonna
02:07 - be speech recognition
02:11 - I always have a trouble spelling this
02:13 - word I believe that's correct
02:14 - I'm installing that you can see I
02:16 - already have it installed but that's the
02:18 - first module so speech recognition the
02:20 - next one we are going to install is
02:22 - going to be Google text-to-speech which
02:24 - is G TTS and this capital on the T T and
02:28 - s and that is just Google text-to-speech
02:31 - will install that one and we need two
02:33 - more so the next one we're gonna have is
02:35 - play sound now what play sound is gonna
02:38 - do is literally just play sound from
02:40 - Python for us pretty straightforward and
02:43 - the last one we need is PI audio so pip
02:47 - install PI audio now I don't have any
02:50 - issue installing this but I know some
02:52 - people have said they've had issues
02:53 - installing this before so make sure
02:54 - you're a really quick fix on if you
02:56 - can't install PI audio this way how you
02:58 - can actually do it so what you're gonna
03:00 - need to do is go to this website here
03:02 - which will be at the link in the
03:03 - description and download the appropriate
03:05 - Weill file for pi audio so you can see
03:07 - here it shows all the different versions
03:09 - of this wheel file which is just
03:11 - essentially what you're installing when
03:12 - you install something with pip it just
03:14 - downloads this file for you you see this
03:17 - one is like Python 2 7 because it says
03:18 - CP 2 7 and then windows 32-bit so what
03:22 - you're gonna look for is your Python
03:24 - version and whatever bit version you're
03:25 - using so in this case I'm using Python 3
03:27 - 7 with a AMD 64 so like 64-bit so this
03:32 - would be the file I download this one
03:34 - right here I already have it downloaded
03:35 - but that's someone you would click on
03:36 - and if you want to check your Python
03:38 - version to do that just type Python or
03:40 - you might have to type Python 3
03:42 - depending on how many pythons you have
03:44 - installed on your machine and you will
03:46 - see that it shows your Python version
03:47 - here and then whatever bit version
03:50 - you're using in these little square
03:51 - brackets so anyways that's how you
03:53 - download that file but now that you've
03:55 - downloaded that file you actually need
03:57 - to install it so to install it what
03:59 - you're gonna do is find where you
04:00 - downloaded it so you're probably gonna
04:02 - have it in downloads so you can see that
04:05 - I have one here actually I have two
04:06 - versions but there's one right here what
04:08 - I'm gonna do is open up a command prompt
04:09 - window here just by typing in this top
04:13 - excuse me so I'm just gonna open up a
04:15 - command prompt window here just by
04:17 - typing CMD in this top navigation bar
04:19 - and then what I can actually do is use
04:20 - pip and install this file so to do that
04:23 - I'm gonna do
04:24 - Hiep install and I'm gonna type PI and
04:27 - assuming there's something else that
04:28 - starts with py in my folder I can just
04:31 - hit tab and it's actually gonna bring up
04:33 - that file itself so pi audio like this
04:36 - and then what I can do is hit enter and
04:38 - that should install this for me now you
04:40 - can see I already have it installed but
04:42 - that's a way to get around this and it
04:44 - should say like successfully installed
04:45 - pi audio if for some reason your pip
04:48 - version of pi audio is not working which
04:50 - mine wasn't before anyways that is how
04:53 - we get everything installed and now it's
04:54 - actually time to start writing some code
04:55 - so I'm gonna close out all of this and
04:57 - right now you can see that I am in sub
04:59 - line text this is what I'm gonna be
05:01 - using for the majority of this tutorial
05:02 - series now if you want to download sub
05:05 - line text just look it up it's pretty
05:07 - straightforward but you can use anything
05:08 - you want so long as you know how to run
05:10 - the file and test things out okay so
05:12 - I've actually saved everything here into
05:14 - a folder I'm not sure if you guys can
05:16 - see up top here but I'm inside of a
05:18 - voice assistant folder I'd recommend you
05:20 - save your files inside of a folder
05:22 - because we're gonna have a few different
05:24 - things in there but anyways up to you
05:26 - let's go ahead and start coding so I'm
05:29 - just gonna import these modules that I
05:31 - need first of all so I'm going to import
05:33 - OS on an import time I'm gonna import
05:37 - play sound I'm gonna import speech
05:41 - underscore recognition as SR so standing
05:47 - for a speech recognition Oh what is it
05:49 - doing that for
05:49 - I want SR okay and now I'm going to
05:54 - import G TTS and I actually believe I
05:58 - need to import something from an ass or
05:59 - I'm gonna do from G TT s imports G TTS
06:06 - and that's a capital on the T TNS okay
06:10 - so now that we have that we have all our
06:11 - imports done and we can actually start
06:12 - writing some code so the first thing I'm
06:14 - going to do is just make it so that we
06:16 - can actually give some text to the
06:19 - computer and have it to say it to us now
06:21 - this seems pretty straightforward but
06:22 - sometimes you ran into some issues so
06:24 - anyways just try to follow along here
06:25 - I'm going to create a function that says
06:27 - speak and I'm gonna have a parameter
06:29 - called text and what this is gonna do is
06:31 - just take this text and speak it like
06:34 - say it out of our computer speakers so
06:36 - to do this
06:37 - we're gonna say TTS is equal to G TTS
06:41 - dots are not dots are just brackets I'm
06:44 - gonna say text equals text Lang equals
06:49 - en and what this is gonna do is just
06:51 - pretty much transform this text into an
06:55 - audio file with the language of English
06:57 - that's what Yen stands for now what
06:59 - we're gonna do is actually save this
07:00 - audio file and then play that audio file
07:03 - it's kind of weird how you have to save
07:04 - the file first but that's just the way
07:05 - that I found works best that's what I
07:07 - mean do I don't say file name is equal
07:10 - to in this case I'll just say voice dot
07:12 - mp3 it's gonna save as mp3 file I'm
07:15 - gonna say TTS dot save file name and
07:19 - what this is gonna do is save the file
07:21 - voiced on mp3 which is gonna contain the
07:24 - Google Voice saying whatever text it is
07:26 - we passed here to an mp3 file that's in
07:29 - the same folder as wherever this Python
07:31 - file is then what I'm gonna do is do
07:33 - play sound dot play sound and simply
07:38 - load in this file name and it will play
07:40 - this mp3 file so we can actually hear
07:42 - what it says um now that is pretty much
07:44 - it for actually making the speakers you
07:46 - know like say something from Python now
07:48 - all we don't need to do if we want to
07:50 - actually play this is just do speak and
07:52 - then put whatever we want in fear so you
07:53 - like hello Tim as the text and if I run
07:57 - this now we should see that we're gonna
07:59 - hear this come out so I mean we'll check
08:01 - this is the first try and see if we get
08:03 - it hello Tim and there we go so
08:08 - hopefully you guys were able to hear
08:09 - that but it says hello Tim there is a
08:11 - little bit of latency on it because what
08:12 - it needs to do is generate this file
08:14 - which takes a second save the file and
08:16 - then load it back in and play the sound
08:18 - um but anyways that is how we get some
08:21 - sound out to our computer you guys feel
08:23 - free to mess around with this knowing
08:25 - this alone you can create some cool
08:26 - things with Python but anyways in the
08:29 - next video we're gonna be doing is
08:30 - actually getting sound from the users of
08:32 - them speaking into the microphone
08:34 - recognizing what they're saying
08:35 - transform you into text and then doing
08:37 - something with that anyways if you guys
08:39 - enjoyed make sure you leave a like and
08:40 - make sure to leave some comment ideas
08:42 - down below on what you want to see from
08:44 - this series

hello everyone and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on a Python voice assistant now what we're gonna be doing is essentially creating a virtual slash voice assistant using Python the Google

gonna work what I'm gonna be doing for this tutorial series is breaking everything into parts where each part is where I'm gonna implement a new feature of the virtual assistant I have a few ideas for things I'd like to do but if there's anything you want to see as a part of this virtual assistant like a feature or something that it can do leave a comment down below right now and let me know and whatever ones are liked the most or just that I like I will try to implement into the series as we can do a ton of stuff within this series and different things I'm thinking right now that we can have some kind of web scraping so it can you know you can ask you to question it can Google something find the answer I'm thinking we can get it to do some kind of automation for us like maybe we want to track expenses or something and we can tell it you know like oh I bought this today I logged in an Excel spreadsheet I don't know is it a few small ideas I have but let me know so today's what we're gonna be doing today is just getting some audio coming out of the computer so pretty much figuring out how to use Google texttospeech as well as just installing some packages that we're gonna need so the first thing we're gonna do is open up a command prompt window you can do that by typing CMD in your window search bar here or I mean if you're on Linux and I assume you know to do this then what

anyways in the next video we're gonna be doing is actually getting sound from the users of them speaking into the microphone recognizing what they're saying transform you into text and then doing something with that anyways if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like and make sure to leave some comment ideas down below on what you want to see from this series
