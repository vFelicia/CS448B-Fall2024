00:02 - just a good programmer is to learn about
00:05 - design patterns and architecture a lot
00:07 - of times when you start writing code you
00:09 - write very small programs right maybe
00:10 - something that's 50 lines 100 lines of
00:12 - code but as soon as you get into a very
00:14 - large code base you know you're talking
00:15 - tens of thousands of lines of code you
00:17 - really need to understand the way in
00:19 - which these different pieces of code are
00:21 - going to work together and the way that
00:22 - you're going to structure your program
00:24 - such that you're not going to have to go
00:26 - back and rewrite 10 000 lines of code
00:28 - you need to learn these things so that
00:30 - you can actually work on large systems
00:32 - and get out of the very hobby projects
00:34 - and realize how to work on large systems
00:36 - and real code that you're actually going
00:38 - to see in a production environment
