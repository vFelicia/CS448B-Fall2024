00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to other
00:02 - django tutorials so in today's video
00:04 - what we're gonna be doing it's just
00:05 - adding bootstrap to our website and
00:06 - doing a little bit of styling I'm gonna
00:08 - show you guys how we can add some just
00:10 - nice-looking classes and how you can
00:13 - kind of look through the bootstrap
00:14 - documentation to find what you're
00:15 - looking for so all we'll do is really
00:17 - just style a few different elements and
00:19 - make things look a bit nicer and then
00:21 - I'm kinda gonna leave the rest to you
00:22 - guys so with that being said let's get
00:25 - started so I'm gonna head over to the
00:27 - bootstrap website and it actually gives
00:29 - you a really easy and quick way to get
00:31 - bootstrap on your website and all we're
00:34 - gonna do to do this is just kind of
00:35 - follow this page so first let's talk a
00:38 - little bit about what bootstrap is so
00:40 - bootstrap essentially is a CSS
00:43 - JavaScript jQuery framework which allows
00:46 - for you to add some custom built styling
00:49 - to your website now this actual
00:51 - framework is built on what's known as a
00:53 - mobile first site framework early so
00:56 - it's meant for building responsive
00:58 - mobile websites that and then they will
01:01 - expand to desktop applications so
01:03 - apparently that is kind of the best way
01:05 - to do it now is to build stuff ideally
01:07 - for mobile because that is where most of
01:09 - the web traffic is nowadays I believe I
01:11 - could be incorrect so you build it first
01:14 - for mobile and then you kind of expand
01:16 - it out into desktop so anyways let's get
01:20 - started and use bootstrap so what we're
01:23 - gonna do is just follow this page so the
01:24 - first thing you need to do is copy this
01:26 - link here so CSS and I'll leave the link
01:28 - to this page in the description if you
01:30 - want to do this as well so I'm gonna
01:31 - copy this stylesheet here and all this
01:34 - all this is essentially is this kind of
01:37 - stylesheet but just online that we're
01:39 - gonna access and be able to use so it's
01:41 - served on what's known as a content
01:43 - delivery network which we don't actually
01:44 - have to download the stylesheet
01:46 - we can just copy this link in here at
01:49 - the bottom of our head tags but just
01:52 - above the title and we will start using
01:54 - this this stylesheet on our website now
01:58 - that we've done that there's a few other
02:00 - things we need to add so let me go down
02:01 - here to the starter template and just
02:03 - copy a few things we're missing the
02:05 - first thing I'm gonna add is just these
02:07 - meta tags and these meta tags apparently
02:09 - are important they just set up some
02:10 - properties for your website so we'll put
02:13 - them
02:13 - is linked like that just to finding the
02:16 - type of characters you can be using and
02:18 - then I believe this is something to do
02:20 - with the mobile friendly kind of look or
02:23 - whatnot so now that we've added that
02:24 - they might have to go above that we'll
02:27 - add those bub
02:28 - we'll add this doctype HTML so just
02:30 - exclamation point doctype HTML we'll add
02:32 - that at the top of our file like that
02:34 - hit save and I'm just gonna move these
02:37 - meta tags to go above our link here so
02:40 - our stylesheet like that sweet so now
02:44 - that we've added that there's only one
02:45 - more thing is three more things actually
02:47 - that we need to add and those would be
02:49 - these scripts and these scripts are used
02:51 - by some of these CSS classes and to do a
02:54 - little bit of animation and just make
02:56 - things look a bit nicer maybe move some
02:58 - components around the page so we're
03:00 - gonna add these at the bottom of our
03:01 - body tags so underneath all of the
03:03 - content here now you don't necessarily
03:06 - need to add these scripts but in some
03:09 - cases when you use certain CSS classes
03:11 - they will require these and then things
03:13 - might look a little bit funkier things
03:15 - might be off so anyways now that we've
03:17 - added that we're actually ready to start
03:19 - using bootstrap so the first thing I'm
03:21 - gonna do is kind of add some divs and
03:23 - some different classes into my main
03:25 - content block here and I'll talk briefly
03:27 - about what they do but really the way to
03:29 - understand this stuff is just to go to
03:31 - the bootstrap documentation so for
03:34 - example if I go here and just look at
03:37 - all the different components and cut
03:38 - copy the stuff that you like that what
03:41 - it looks like and then customize it so
03:43 - for example if you wanted a large button
03:44 - you would go to the buttons tab here for
03:46 - components this link will be in
03:47 - description as well look at a button you
03:49 - like and then literally just copy the
03:51 - tag or the class for it and then you can
03:53 - customize it accordingly so that's what
03:56 - I'm gonna be doing for this kind of and
03:58 - I'm just gonna be copying some code that
03:59 - I've already written to style my website
04:01 - in a way that I think looks I mean
04:03 - decent okay I've been gone too far I
04:05 - didn't take too long to do this so
04:06 - anyways let's add some dibs here
04:08 - so the first div I'm gonna add is class
04:10 - equals in this case row and then justify
04:13 - in this case content content and center
04:20 - it like that which this is gonna mean
04:22 - we're going to put this in the middle of
04:23 - our web page
04:25 - so yeah so I thought and now what we'll
04:27 - do is we will add another div and this
04:31 - div we're gonna say class equals and in
04:33 - this case column H which is going to
04:36 - define what column space we're gonna be
04:37 - in we will end this div here and we'll
04:41 - add a few other things as well so now
04:42 - I'm gonna add an h1 tag and this h1 tag
04:45 - is actually gonna be the header of my
04:47 - website so inside of this tag you're
04:49 - gonna call whatever your header you want
04:51 - so I'm just gonna say - my site and I'm
04:54 - gonna give this a class of in this case
04:56 - we will say MT - 2 again I'm just taking
05:01 - these from the bootstrap website if you
05:02 - don't know what this stuff means you can
05:04 - either just look up the class and it'll
05:06 - show you the styling for it or you can
05:08 - just go to the bootstrap website and
05:09 - look for ones that you like so this case
05:11 - i'm gonna do mt 0 mb - 4 and what this
05:16 - is gonna do is draw a little line for us
05:18 - underneath our header just make things
05:20 - look a little bit nicer so that's all
05:22 - i'm actually gonna add here for this
05:24 - main base template now let's go to our
05:27 - website and let's see how it looks so
05:29 - this is what it looks like before and
05:30 - just with those few adjustments when i
05:32 - refresh the page notes see how it looks
05:33 - now okay so there we go
05:35 - um so actually so these little check
05:38 - buttons here shouldn't be here one
05:40 - second guys just because I might not
05:42 - have saved a page those messing around
05:44 - with it before it let me refresh this
05:45 - now ah there we go so that's now what
05:48 - we're getting now it should be in the
05:50 - middle of the page we just kind of throw
05:52 - me off just a little bit I spelt justify
05:55 - incorrectly that would be why so row
05:57 - justified content center I knew I was
05:59 - doing something wrong there so now let's
06:01 - refresh this and there we go now we can
06:03 - see that it's moved to the middle of the
06:04 - page and we have this line here
06:07 - obviously as well still sweet so that's
06:10 - it for just styling the base template so
06:13 - now that's going to apply to all the web
06:14 - pages that we have if I go to create for
06:17 - example you can see that it applies to
06:18 - this as well so now it is time to style
06:21 - some of the other pages that we have so
06:23 - the first one I'm gonna style is this
06:25 - create page so notice this is what it
06:26 - looks like now let's mess around with
06:28 - this now what I'm gonna do is change
06:31 - some aspects of this form so I'm gonna
06:33 - add a class here and I'm gonna say this
06:35 - class is form
06:36 - - group
06:38 - I'm just gonna put this create page into
06:40 - let's say like an h3 tag for right now
06:43 - just because I want it to be a little
06:45 - bit bigger on the page and won't add any
06:47 - any styling to that so now we'll add
06:50 - some divs inside of this so the first
06:53 - step that I'm gonna have is just gonna
06:54 - be an input group so I'm going to say
06:56 - div and in this case class equals input
07:01 - - group in this case MB - 3 and then I
07:05 - will end this like this I believe this
07:09 - might be the correct place for it I'm
07:11 - probably enough to mess around at these
07:12 - a little bit we'll see I'm also just
07:14 - gonna put this form instead of doing
07:16 - form as P I'm just gonna get the name
07:18 - attribute from our form so the way I do
07:20 - that is just by saying form name so
07:23 - rather than showing the entire form
07:24 - because we have that little check button
07:25 - I'm just gonna show the name textbox cuz
07:28 - that's all I actually want for right now
07:29 - so now what I'm gonna do is actually I'm
07:32 - gonna move this underneath here my
07:34 - apologies and I'm gonna add another div
07:36 - and this one is gonna be class equals
07:40 - and in this case input
07:42 - - group - 3 pent now this is a really
07:46 - nice div that they have here the class
07:49 - that they've made and what this does is
07:50 - all you guys will see in a second is it
07:52 - makes this button kind of mesh with this
07:55 - text input so they go they look at like
07:57 - in one line where it has the button and
07:59 - then it has the text input field right
08:01 - beside it but they're like combined
08:03 - together and it looks really nice you
08:04 - guys will see in a second how that looks
08:06 - now the last thing I'm gonna do is just
08:08 - add a class to my actual button itself
08:10 - so I'm going to say class equals in this
08:12 - case BTN and then BTN - what was it
08:17 - success I believe yes
08:19 - BTN - success and that might actually be
08:22 - it for all of my styling for this page
08:25 - so let's go ahead and have a look down
08:27 - and see how this looks if I run this
08:29 - there we go we get creep age and now you
08:31 - can see what this prepended it took this
08:33 - button and it put it on the left side of
08:36 - my text input and notice that we get
08:38 - this little these little things coming
08:40 - up this happens obviously because of
08:42 - some of the JavaScript and stuff we have
08:45 - please fill out this field you can see
08:47 - that's there we're gonna create new we
08:49 - can see that pops up with there's a ha
08:51 - for just all this nice stuff that
08:52 - bootstrap does for us some of it's done
08:54 - by Jango but most of it's done by
08:56 - bootstrap now let me go to view so now
08:58 - it's time to make this one look a little
09:00 - bit nicer so let's go ahead and do that
09:02 - and then we'll wrap up the video here so
09:04 - this will be a little bit more tedious
09:07 - but let's actually get rid of this kind
09:09 - of ul view and tags and stuff because I
09:12 - don't think we're gonna need to use
09:14 - these yeah so let's get rid of these you
09:16 - l's and let's get rid of these allies
09:18 - because right last time we're just using
09:20 - allies to make them show up in a nice
09:22 - kind of group but we'll use some some
09:24 - classes here from bootstrap to do that
09:26 - for us so we can tab this back so let me
09:30 - do that actually I probably should just
09:31 - left it cuz I'm gonna have to put this
09:32 - inside of dip but anyways inside of a
09:35 - for loop now I'm gonna create a div I'm
09:37 - gonna say this class is equal to and in
09:40 - this case input - group and then we'll
09:44 - do mb - 3 and then I'm gonna add a
09:48 - prepend in here as well because I want
09:51 - to combine these check boxes with
09:53 - wouldn't call it the text which will add
09:56 - in a cool way in a second so I'm gonna
09:58 - delete these text right now what I'm
10:00 - gonna do is add a prepend here so I'm
10:02 - gonna say div and in this case class
10:06 - equals and in this case what was it it
10:09 - was something like prepend input group -
10:11 - prepend input group - prepend let's tab
10:16 - these in we will end this div and we
10:20 - will end the other dip as well just make
10:21 - sure we don't forget like that so now
10:25 - what I'm gonna do is outside of this
10:27 - this div but inside of the other one I'm
10:29 - going to add that text that I have back
10:32 - in so I need to actually get the item
10:33 - text I'm gonna add this though in a
10:35 - weird way I'm gonna add this in an input
10:38 - box so the way I'm going to do this I'm
10:39 - gonna say input and in this case we'll
10:41 - say type equals text and then we'll
10:46 - simply just say value equals and in this
10:50 - case we'll say was it item dot text like
10:56 - that now we'll add a class to this as
10:58 - well we'll say class here equals and in
11:01 - this case
11:03 - form - control and there we go now
11:07 - that's it for the kind of displaying the
11:10 - items let's actually have a sneak peek
11:12 - of how this looks and see if I made any
11:14 - mistakes or not okay so it's not ideally
11:18 - what we wanted to look like we can see
11:19 - we have these text box and we have the
11:22 - check button so let me make sure I
11:23 - didn't make any critical errors here
11:25 - before I might have either misspelled
11:27 - something or forgot to add something ah
11:29 - so I've forgotten one class which was
11:31 - probably pretty important here so we're
11:33 - gonna add another div and in this case
11:35 - we'll say div class and in this case
11:37 - equals input
11:40 - - group - text will end that div where
11:45 - is the stip ending I believe right here
11:48 - and that should be good for that I don't
11:52 - want to say for sure but let's see there
11:54 - we go
11:55 - so that's better this is what I wanted
11:56 - now you can see we have the check button
11:58 - dov showing up on a nice little color
12:00 - here and then all of our items show up
12:01 - in text boxes and I mean you can
12:03 - actually edit the items but when you
12:05 - save them it's not gonna it'll just go
12:07 - back to whatever you had but I just
12:08 - wanted to do them in this week so it
12:09 - looks really nice and now what's left to
12:12 - do is just modify these buttons here so
12:14 - let's go ahead and do that
12:15 - so what I'll start by doing is adding a
12:18 - class or a div here so I say div class
12:21 - equals in this case we'll say input -
12:26 - group in this case MB - 3 I will tab all
12:30 - of these I guess except for let's see
12:34 - which ones I actually want I'm gonna put
12:35 - the Save button I think on a different
12:37 - side so let me put the Save button down
12:40 - here and I'll tab these two in these add
12:43 - item and I'm actually gonna do the same
12:44 - thing that I did with the creating a new
12:47 - to-do list in terms of that prepend
12:48 - thing with these items so to do that I'm
12:50 - gonna add another div in here and in
12:52 - this case I'll say div and then class
12:55 - equals in this case input group -
12:58 - prepend you guys can tell I like this
13:00 - this prepend thing that you can do here
13:03 - prepend we will tab these in and then we
13:07 - will close these tubes so / div and /
13:11 - div but I believe that I have to put
13:13 - this input actually
13:16 - right here and that I think is correct
13:20 - there we go sweet so now all I need to
13:22 - do is add some classes to the button so
13:24 - I'll add the same classes that I used on
13:25 - the other one so I'll just say class
13:27 - equals in this case BTN BTN - success
13:31 - and I'll just copy this and we use this
13:33 - class down here as well just to be
13:35 - consistent so anyways that should be it
13:38 - for styling let's have a look now if i
13:40 - refresh continue there we go so now we
13:43 - get add item and we get saved and things
13:45 - are just looking a lot nicer on our
13:47 - website obviously there's a lot of work
13:49 - to be done but taken I did this in 13
13:52 - minutes in a video or ever long this
13:54 - video is and I've been kind of
13:55 - explaining things as I go but I'll
13:57 - quickly show you that if you want to
13:59 - look at the different components and see
14:01 - all is that this different kind of stuff
14:02 - just go to the bootstrap documentation
14:04 - this is the link I'll put in the
14:06 - description go to components here and
14:08 - for example if you want to look at a
14:09 - navbar and how this works then it'll
14:12 - explain to you how to create one and you
14:14 - can just really copy kind of however
14:15 - whatever you want from here if I go to
14:18 - for example buttons you can see all the
14:20 - different kind of buttons and how to
14:22 - make them and it just tells you what
14:25 - classes to use you use those classes and
14:27 - then it looks nice on your webpage so
14:29 - anyways that has been it for this
14:30 - tutorial if you guys enjoy please make
14:32 - sure you leave a like and subscribe and
14:33 - I will see you again in the next one
14:35 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to other django tutorials so in today's video what we're gonna be doing it's just adding bootstrap to our website and doing a little bit of styling I'm gonna show you guys how we can add some just nicelooking classes and how you can kind of look through the bootstrap documentation to find what you're looking for so all we'll do is really just style a few different elements and make things look a bit nicer and then I'm kinda gonna leave the rest to you guys so with that being said let's get started so I'm gonna head over to the bootstrap website and it actually gives you a really easy and quick way to get bootstrap on your website and all we're gonna do to do this is just kind of follow this page so first let's talk a little bit about what bootstrap is so bootstrap essentially is a CSS JavaScript jQuery framework which allows for you to add some custom built styling to your website now this actual framework is built on what's known as a mobile first site framework early so it's meant for building responsive mobile websites that and then they will expand to desktop applications so apparently that is kind of the best way to do it now is to build stuff ideally for mobile because that is where most of the web traffic is nowadays I believe I could be incorrect so you build it first for mobile and then you kind of expand it out into desktop so anyways let's get started and use bootstrap so what we're gonna do is just follow this page so the first thing you need to do is copy this link here so CSS and I'll leave the link to this page in the description if you want to do this as well so I'm gonna copy this stylesheet here and all this all this is essentially is this kind of stylesheet but just online that we're gonna access and be able to use so it's served on what's known as a content delivery network which we don't actually have to download the stylesheet we can just copy this link in here at the bottom of our head tags but just above the title and we will start using this this stylesheet on our website now that we've done that there's a few other things we need to add so let me go down here to the starter template and just copy a few things we're missing the first thing I'm gonna add is just these meta tags and these meta tags apparently are important they just set up some properties for your website so we'll put them is linked like that just to finding the type of characters you can be using and then I believe this is something to do with the mobile friendly kind of look or whatnot so now that we've added that they might have to go above that we'll add those bub we'll add this doctype HTML so just exclamation point doctype HTML we'll add that at the top of our file like that hit save and I'm just gonna move these meta tags to go above our link here so our stylesheet like that sweet so now that we've added that there's only one more thing is three more things actually that we need to add and those would be these scripts and these scripts are used by some of these CSS classes and to do a little bit of animation and just make things look a bit nicer maybe move some components around the page so we're gonna add these at the bottom of our body tags so underneath all of the content here now you don't necessarily need to add these scripts but in some cases when you use certain CSS classes they will

I'm gonna add an h1 tag and this h1 tag is actually gonna be the header of my website so inside of this tag you're gonna call whatever your header you want so I'm just gonna say my site and I'm gonna give this a class of in this case we will say MT 2 again I'm just taking these from the bootstrap website if you don't know what this stuff means you can either just look up the class and it'll show you the styling for it or you can just go to the bootstrap website and look for ones that you like so this case i'm gonna do mt 0 mb 4 and what this is gonna do is draw a little line for us underneath our header just make things look a little bit nicer so that's all i'm actually gonna add here for this main base template now let's go to our website and let's see how it looks so this is what it looks like before and just with those few adjustments when i refresh the page notes see how it looks now okay so there we go um so actually so these little check buttons here shouldn't be here one second guys just because I might not have saved a page those messing around with it before it let me refresh this now ah there we go so that's now what we're getting now it should be in the middle of the page we just kind of throw me off just a little bit I spelt justify incorrectly that would be why so row justified content center I knew I was doing something wrong there so now let's refresh this and there we go now we can see that it's moved to the middle of the page and we have this line here obviously as well still sweet so that's it for just styling the base template so now that's going to apply to all the web pages that we have if I go to create for example you can see that it applies to this as well so now it is time to style some of the other pages that we have so the first one I'm gonna style is this create page so notice this is what it looks like now let's mess around with this now what I'm gonna do is change some aspects of this form so I'm gonna add a class here and I'm gonna say this class is form group I'm just gonna put this create page into let's say like an h3 tag for right now just because I want it to be a little bit bigger on the page and won't add any any styling to that so now we'll add some divs inside of this so the first step that I'm gonna have is just gonna be an input group so I'm going to say div and in this case class equals input group in this case MB 3 and then I will end this like this I believe this might be the correct place for it I'm probably enough to mess around at these a little bit we'll see I'm also just gonna put this form instead of doing form as P I'm just gonna get the name attribute from our form so the way I do that is just by saying form name so rather than showing the entire form because we have that little check button I'm just gonna show the name textbox cuz that's all I actually want for right now so now what I'm gonna do is actually I'm gonna move this underneath here my apologies and I'm gonna add another div and this one is gonna be class equals and in this case input group 3 pent now this is a really nice div that they have here the class that they've made and what this does is all you guys will see in a second is it makes this button kind of mesh with this text input so they go they look at like in one line where it has the button and then it has the text input field right beside it but they're like combined together and it looks really nice you guys will see in a second how that looks now the last thing I'm gonna do is just add a class to my actual button itself so I'm going to say class equals in this case BTN and then BTN what was it success I believe yes BTN success and that might actually be it for all of my styling for this page so let's go ahead and have a look down and see how this looks if I run this there we go we get creep age and now you can see what this prepended it took this button and it put it on the left side of my text input and notice that we get this little these little things coming up this happens obviously because of some of the JavaScript and stuff we have please fill out this field you can see that's there we're gonna create new we can see that pops up with there's a ha for just all this nice stuff that bootstrap does for us some of it's done by Jango but most of it's done by bootstrap now let me go to view so now it's time to make this one look a little bit nicer so let's go ahead and do that and then we'll wrap up the video here so this will be a little bit more tedious but let's actually get rid of this kind of ul view and tags and stuff because I don't think we're gonna need to use these yeah so let's get rid of these you l's and let's get rid of these allies because right last time we're just using allies to make them show up in a nice kind of group but we'll use some some classes here from bootstrap to do that for us so we can tab this back so let me do that actually I probably should just left it cuz I'm gonna have to put this inside of dip but anyways inside of a for loop now I'm gonna create a div I'm gonna say this class is equal to and in this case input group and then we'll do mb 3 and then I'm gonna add a prepend in here as well because I want to combine these check boxes with wouldn't call it the text which will add in a cool way in a second so I'm gonna delete these text right now what I'm gonna do is add a prepend here so I'm gonna say div and in this case class equals and in this case what was it it was something like prepend input group prepend input group prepend let's tab these in we will end this div and we will end the other dip as well just make sure we don't forget like that so now what I'm gonna do is outside of this this div but inside of the other one I'm going to add that text that I have back in so I need to actually get the item text I'm gonna add this though in a weird way I'm gonna add this in an input box so the way I'm going to do this I'm gonna say input and in this case we'll say type equals text and then we'll simply just say value equals and in this case we'll say was it item dot text like that now we'll add a class to this as well we'll say class here equals and in this case form control and there we go now that's it for the kind of displaying the items let's actually have a sneak peek of how this looks and see if I made any mistakes or not okay so it's not ideally what we wanted to look like we can see we have these text box and we have the check button so let me make sure I didn't make any critical errors here before I might have either misspelled something or forgot to add something ah so I've forgotten one class which was probably pretty important here so we're gonna add another div and in this case we'll say div class and in this case equals input group text will end that div where is the stip ending I believe right here and that should be good for that I don't want to say for sure but let's see there we go so that's better this is what I wanted now you can see we have the check button dov showing up on a nice little color here and then all of our items show up in text boxes and I mean you can actually edit the items but when you save them it's not gonna it'll just go back to whatever you had but I just wanted to do them in this week so it looks really nice and now what's left to do is just modify these buttons here so let's go ahead and do that so what I'll start by doing is adding a class or a div here so I say div class equals in this case we'll say input group in this case MB 3 I will tab all of these I guess except for let's see which ones I actually want I'm gonna put the Save button I think on a different side so let me put the Save button down here and I'll tab these two in these add item and I'm actually gonna do the same thing that I did with the creating a new todo list in terms of that prepend thing with these items so to do that I'm gonna add another div in here and in this case I'll say div and then class equals in this case input group prepend you guys can tell I like this this prepend thing that you can do here prepend we will tab these in and then we will close these tubes so / div and / div but I believe that I have to put this input actually right here and that I think is correct there we go sweet so now all I need to do is add some classes to the button so I'll add the same classes that I used on the other one so I'll just say class equals in this case BTN BTN success and I'll just copy this and we use this class down here as well just to be consistent so anyways that should be it for styling let's have a look now if i refresh continue there we go so now we get add item and we get saved and things are just looking a lot nicer on our website obviously there's a lot of work to be done but taken I did this in 13 minutes in a video or ever long this video is and I've been kind of explaining things as I go but I'll quickly show you that if you want to look at the different components and see all is that this different kind of stuff just go to the bootstrap documentation this is the link I'll put in the description go to components here and for example if you want to look at a navbar and how this works then it'll explain to you how to create one and you can just really copy kind of however whatever you want from here if I go to for example buttons you can see all the different kind of buttons and how to make them and it just tells you what classes to use you use those classes and then it looks nice on your webpage so anyways that has been it for this tutorial if you guys enjoy please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
