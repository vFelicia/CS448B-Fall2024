00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video this is the 17th video in
00:05 - my Python programming series and today
00:07 - we're going to be talking about
00:08 - functions more advanced functions and
00:11 - something called optional parameters so
00:13 - let's just give a quick refresher of
00:15 - what a function is I'm just going to
00:16 - write one very quickly I did do another
00:18 - video on basic function so if you
00:20 - haven't seen that yet go check that one
00:21 - out first now here we've defined what
00:24 - we're going to call the function func
00:26 - and then inside of these brackets we put
00:30 - something called parameters if you
00:31 - remember that from the other video so in
00:33 - this case I'm just going to put X as my
00:34 - only parameter and then I'm simply going
00:37 - to print X to the screen just like that
00:40 - so a very very basic function but it's
00:43 - just to give you a quick refresher of
00:44 - what it does now when we wanted to call
00:46 - our function all we had to do was write
00:48 - our function name and then put a
00:50 - brackets or the brackets like this and
00:53 - then inside of our brackets if we had a
00:54 - parameter set we had to do we had to
00:57 - give it that parameter so we could do
00:58 - three we could do hello let's just do
01:00 - hello in this case and we'll click f5
01:02 - and we get hello on the screen just like
01:06 - that now we can change this again to
01:08 - maybe Tim which is my name just like
01:10 - that and we get to M printed the screen
01:13 - very basic very easy just like that okay
01:16 - so that's pretty much what a function is
01:17 - now what we're going to talk about today
01:20 - is more in-depth on these parameters so
01:23 - you remember we could give it multiple
01:24 - parameters so we do X we could do maybe
01:27 - text like this so we had X and text and
01:30 - we could print X to the screen and maybe
01:32 - we'll say if text is equal to UM let's
01:37 - say 1 so with a string 1 then maybe
01:40 - we'll print text is 1 otherwise so else
01:46 - we will print text is not 1 just like
01:52 - that very easy ok so now what we have to
01:54 - do when we call the function is we have
01:56 - to give it another parameter in this
01:57 - case I'm going to give it 2 and we'll
02:00 - see what happens we get Tim and then
02:03 - texture I misspelled that my bad is not
02:06 - 1 now if I change this parameter to 1
02:08 - again we'll see that we get text is 1
02:12 - now again that's just another example
02:14 - but in some cases when we call a
02:16 - function and we have many parameters and
02:19 - maybe we don't have many but we don't
02:21 - want to constantly be rewriting these
02:23 - parameters we want to have something
02:25 - called the default value for our
02:27 - parameters so X maybe we always want to
02:30 - give our function the value of X but in
02:33 - text here we always want it to be set to
02:36 - something unless we otherwise specify so
02:39 - in this case I'm going to say text and
02:42 - then the equal sign I'm going to put two
02:45 - just like that
02:46 - now here I'm going to remove the one and
02:50 - you'll see what will happen here we'll
02:52 - just run it to show you and then we'll
02:53 - go in what's actually happening so we
02:56 - get Tim and then text is not one so what
02:59 - actually happened here is since I didn't
03:02 - specify a value for text so I didn't do
03:05 - a comma and write something else here it
03:07 - defaulted to the value of two now we can
03:10 - prove that by just simply printing out
03:12 - text and showing you that it is actually
03:15 - two so we have Tim and two just like
03:18 - that if I wanted to change this value
03:21 - now all I would have to do is simply put
03:25 - a comma here in the function and change
03:27 - it to whatever I want so in this case
03:29 - I'll do 67 and if we print it again
03:32 - you'll see we get 67 so that's how the
03:35 - optional parameter works now all you
03:38 - have to do to set an optional parameter
03:40 - is simply type an equal sign after your
03:44 - parameter so if I have X and I'll set it
03:46 - equal to three like that now when I call
03:49 - the function I actually don't have to
03:51 - give it any parameters because it
03:54 - already has the optional parameter of
03:55 - three and of two which are going to be
03:57 - the default values if I don't write
03:59 - anything in my function argument here so
04:02 - inside of these brackets and you'll see
04:05 - you again we get three and two because
04:06 - those are the default values now there
04:09 - is one tricky thing that you have to
04:12 - understand about these optional
04:13 - parameters say you wanted to have X stay
04:17 - at the default value so you want it to
04:19 - be three and you didn't want to type
04:21 - three in the brackets like that but you
04:24 - wanted to change the text
04:25 - optional parameter - something like
04:28 - seven or eight or maybe another string
04:30 - well you can't actually do that in order
04:33 - to change this text optional parameter
04:35 - you would have to also set a value for X
04:38 - here so if I try to I'll say I just want
04:41 - to set the text to three so I'll do like
04:43 - three here it's actually not going to
04:46 - change I'm sorry and what do you call it
04:49 - isn't I'll change it something else so
04:50 - we can see it better - five let's do
04:52 - five it's actually not going to change
04:55 - that second variable right it's going to
04:56 - change the first one automatically
04:58 - because that's just the order in which
05:00 - they're defined so if you wanna if you
05:02 - have more than one optional parameter
05:04 - you will have to set a value for the one
05:07 - before in order to change the one
05:09 - afterwards like this so that's the only
05:12 - tricky part about these optional
05:13 - parameters other than that they're
05:15 - extremely useful again you would use
05:18 - them if you're constantly using a
05:20 - function and you don't want to have to
05:22 - keep writing in parameters you only want
05:24 - to give it a parameter in a very
05:25 - specific case then you would have that
05:28 - optional parameter already set so you
05:29 - don't have to keep typing a certain word
05:31 - you don't have to keep giving it a value
05:33 - like that so this has been a shorter
05:35 - video but this is the video on how to do
05:37 - an optional parameter they look just
05:40 - like this they're very simple and pretty
05:41 - basic and I hope you learned something
05:44 - today if you did please like and
05:45 - subscribe I will see you again in
05:48 - another video

hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video this is the 17th video in my Python programming series and today we're going to be talking about functions more advanced functions and something called optional parameters so let's just give a quick refresher of what a function is I'm just going to write one very quickly I did do another video on basic function so if you haven't seen that yet go check that one out first now here we've defined what we're going to call the function func and then inside of these brackets we put something called parameters if you remember that from the other video so in this case I'm just going to put X as my only parameter and then I'm simply going to print X to the screen just like that so a very very basic function but it's just to give you a quick refresher of what it does now when we wanted to call our function all we had to do was write our function name and then put a brackets or the brackets like this and then inside of our brackets if we had a parameter set we had to do we had to give it that parameter so we could do three we could do hello let's just do hello in this case and we'll click f5 and we get hello on the screen just like that now we can change this again to maybe Tim which is my name just like that and we get to M printed the screen very basic very easy just like that okay so that's pretty much what a function is now what we're going to talk about today is more indepth on these parameters so you remember we could give it multiple parameters so we do X we could do maybe text like this so we had X and text and we could print X to the screen and maybe we'll say if text is equal to UM let's say 1 so with a string 1 then maybe we'll print text is 1 otherwise so else we will print text is not 1 just like that very easy ok so now what we have to do when we call the function is we have to give it another parameter in this case I'm going to give it 2 and we'll see what happens we get Tim and then texture I misspelled that my bad is not 1 now if I change this parameter to 1 again we'll see that we get text is 1 now again that's just another example but in some cases when we call a function and we have many parameters and maybe we don't have many but we don't want to constantly be rewriting these parameters we want to have something called the default value for our parameters so X maybe we always want to give our function the value of X but in text here we always want it to be set to something unless we otherwise specify so in this case I'm going to say text and then the equal sign I'm going to put two just like that now here I'm going to remove the one and you'll see what will happen here we'll just run it to show you and then we'll go in what's actually happening so we get Tim and then text is not one so what actually happened here is since I didn't specify a value for text so I didn't do a comma and write something else here it defaulted to the value of two now we can prove that by just simply printing out text and showing you that it is actually two so we have Tim and two just like that if I wanted to change this value now all I would have to do is simply put a comma here in the function and change it to whatever I want so in this case I'll do 67 and if we print it again you'll see we get 67 so that's how the optional parameter works now all you have to do to set an optional parameter is simply type an equal sign after your parameter so if I have X and I'll set it equal to three like that now when I call the function I actually don't have to give it any parameters because it already has the optional parameter of three and of two which are going to be the default values if I don't write anything in my function argument here so inside of these brackets and you'll see you again we get three and two because those are the default values now there is one tricky thing that you have to understand about these optional parameters say you wanted to have X stay at the default value so you want it to be three and you didn't want to type three in the brackets like that but you wanted to change the text optional parameter something like seven or eight or maybe another string well you can't actually do that in order to change this text optional parameter you would have to also set a value for X here so if I try to I'll say I just want to set the text to three so I'll do like three here it's actually not going to change I'm sorry and what do you call it isn't I'll change it something else so we can see it better five let's do five it's actually not going to change that second variable right it's going to change the first one automatically because that's just the order in which they're defined so if you wanna if you have more than one optional parameter you will have to set a value for the one before in order to change the one afterwards like this so that's the only tricky part about these optional parameters other than that they're extremely useful again you would use them if you're constantly using a function and you don't want to have to keep writing in parameters you only want to give it a parameter in a very specific case then you would have that optional parameter already set so you don't have to keep typing a certain word you don't have to keep giving it a value like that so this has been a shorter video but this is the video on how to do an optional parameter they look just like this they're very simple and pretty basic and I hope you learned something today if you did please like and subscribe I will see you again in another video
