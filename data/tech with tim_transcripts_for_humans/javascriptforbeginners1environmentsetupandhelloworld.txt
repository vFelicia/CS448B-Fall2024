00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to a brand
00:01 - new series on JavaScript for beginners
00:03 - what I'm gonna do right now is give you
00:05 - a brief overview of what you can expect
00:06 - from this tutorial series a little bit
00:08 - about my background with JavaScript so
00:10 - you know if you'd like to watch this
00:11 - series or not and then we're gonna get
00:12 - into some basic environment setup and
00:14 - talk about how we can run our JavaScript
00:16 - code but first of all I feel like I need
00:18 - to mention this if you guys have looked
00:20 - at my channel you realize that almost
00:21 - everything on there is Python with the
00:23 - exception for a few Java videos not
00:25 - JavaScript Java now I actually know
00:27 - JavaScript I used to do it a lot when I
00:29 - was younger so maybe 14 or 15 I'm 19 now
00:31 - for any of you that are wondering and I
00:33 - really wanted to get back into it
00:34 - because it's growing as a language
00:36 - rapidly and there's a lot that you can
00:37 - do if you know both Python and
00:39 - JavaScript you can move into kind of a
00:41 - full stack developer position where you
00:43 - understand the front-end and you
00:44 - understand the backend so that's an
00:46 - advantage for any of you guys if you do
00:47 - know another programming language
00:48 - especially something like Python or kind
00:50 - of a back-end web technology if you
00:52 - learned something like JavaScript that
00:53 - is really a complementing skill and
00:55 - that's the reason that I want to teach
00:57 - it to you guys but what really is
00:59 - JavaScript now I'm sure some of you guys
01:01 - don't really understand exactly how it
01:03 - works or what it is but essentially
01:04 - javascript is a language that is run
01:06 - primarily from your browser so unlike
01:08 - python which is typically a server-side
01:10 - language which is gonna run off a linux
01:12 - server and be responsible for doing the
01:14 - backend of websites and HTTP requests
01:16 - and all of that when you have JavaScript
01:18 - what it's gonna be doing is dealing with
01:20 - some front-end information so it's
01:21 - actually gonna run directly in this
01:23 - chrome web browser and it's gonna be
01:25 - responsible for your interaction with
01:27 - the page so essentially say I click a
01:29 - button so here download for Windows
01:31 - we're going to talk about this in a
01:32 - second that will run a JavaScript
01:34 - function that will actually you know
01:35 - download this and same thing with a lot
01:38 - of other features on this page and just
01:41 - other web pages in general you see any
01:43 - kind of games made in the browser
01:44 - chances are they might actually be made
01:46 - with JavaScript and there's just a lot
01:48 - of things that you do kind of front-end
01:50 - wise using that technology now this is
01:52 - great it makes this language super
01:54 - flexible and really great to learn
01:55 - because this essentially means you can
01:57 - develop for any platform if you know
01:59 - JavaScript whereas something like Python
02:01 - you know you need to make sure you have
02:02 - a compiler on that actual computer and
02:05 - it might not necessarily work depending
02:07 - on what
02:07 - when you're in where as JavaScript all
02:09 - you need is a web browser to actually
02:10 - run that code which means essentially
02:12 - one JavaScript will work on any device
02:15 - any computer so long as it has a web
02:17 - browser that being said javascript is
02:19 - also a massively growing language a lot
02:21 - of high tech companies are looking for
02:23 - people that know JavaScript and it's a
02:25 - really easy way to get into kind of web
02:27 - development actually secure a job
02:29 - especially if you don't have an
02:30 - education or a background in computer
02:31 - size or software engineering or
02:34 - something like that so anyways that's
02:36 - enough for kind of the information about
02:37 - that sorry if I've bored any of you guys
02:39 - but now let's get into the environment
02:40 - set up start writing a basic hello world
02:42 - program and then we'll end off at the
02:44 - end of there and move into some more
02:45 - advanced stuff in the next video so the
02:47 - first thing that we need to do if we're
02:49 - gonna write JavaScript is we need a
02:50 - place to write it now what I'm gonna be
02:52 - using is sublime text which is just a
02:55 - pretty standard text editor which will
02:57 - allow us to have some syntax
02:58 - highlighting and some autocomplete while
03:00 - we write our code so I'm gonna leave a
03:01 - link in the description but if you need
03:02 - to start off by downloading this editor
03:04 - you can also use any other editor you
03:06 - want but this is what I'm gonna be using
03:07 - for these videos once we do that what we
03:10 - need to do is open up sublime text you
03:12 - might get some pop-ups just scroll
03:13 - through them don't worry we need to
03:15 - create a new file which is actually
03:16 - gonna be an HTML file so what I'm gonna
03:18 - do in sub-line here is go to file new
03:21 - file you'll see it pops up as untitled
03:23 - as a new tab you can go file save as or
03:27 - simply hit ctrl s and then type in the
03:30 - name of your file make sure I'm just
03:32 - going to call this one tutorial 1
03:33 - although I do already have that file
03:35 - make sure it says all files and add your
03:37 - extension of dot HTML
03:39 - the reason we're gonna do this is
03:41 - because it the way we're actually going
03:42 - to look at our dot JavaScript code is by
03:44 - running it through the browser which
03:45 - involves us having an HTML file now you
03:47 - can see here I've already made one so
03:49 - I'm gonna kind of omit this step here
03:50 - but that's what you guys need to do now
03:52 - once we have this you should see
03:54 - tutorial one at the top here which is
03:55 - now actually gonna allow us to start
03:57 - writing some code that we can run in our
03:59 - browser now just notice though and I'm
04:01 - gonna try to find this folder wherever I
04:03 - had it so desktop JavaScript JavaScript
04:06 - tutorial that when you create a file
04:08 - that's dot HTML you should see the icon
04:11 - beside it change to be you know chrome
04:13 - or edge or whatever web browser you're
04:15 - using open Abul now what that
04:16 - essentially means is if I double click
04:18 - on this file you can see that is going
04:19 - to open it in my
04:21 - browser now for some reason that's not
04:23 - working for you what you can always do
04:24 - is type in the direct path to your file
04:26 - in your web browser and that will
04:28 - actually open it up and the reason we're
04:29 - gonna do this is because when we make
04:31 - changes to this HTML file will refresh
04:33 - our web browser and we'll see those
04:35 - changes effect here so this is kind of
04:36 - gonna be our console and our output our
04:38 - web browser where is where we're gonna
04:39 - be writing is inside of this actual text
04:41 - editor I'm gonna get started right away
04:43 - and I'm just gonna start doing some
04:44 - things you guys might be a little bit
04:45 - confused at first you've never seen this
04:47 - before but whenever we write two kind of
04:49 - JavaScript code we need to display it on
04:51 - an HTML page so the basic syntax for
04:53 - creating an HTML page is simply putting
04:56 - HTML tags and then you're gonna put
04:58 - these body tags like this now I'm not
05:00 - gonna focus too much on this syntax cuz
05:01 - it's pretty simple you can probably
05:03 - understand it fairly easily and I'm sure
05:05 - most of you know it but essentially open
05:06 - tags just simply have the word and then
05:09 - close tags have this slash afford the
05:11 - same word so this is our body tags this
05:14 - is our HTML tags our body tags are
05:15 - inside of our HTML tags now inside of
05:18 - body what we're gonna start by doing is
05:20 - just writing some basic HTML just to
05:21 - show you how some things work here so
05:23 - I'm gonna say h1 tags which stands for
05:25 - header 1 is hello now I'll demonstrate
05:27 - that when i refresh the page here hello
05:29 - pops up means everything's working you
05:31 - guys should test that as well to make
05:33 - sure everything is proper now that's
05:34 - great but how do we write JavaScript
05:36 - well when we want to write a script
05:38 - inside of our HTML what we can simply do
05:41 - is type script now nice for me in
05:44 - sublime text view when I hit enter it's
05:46 - automatically gonna fill in some options
05:48 - for me you can see we have the type
05:50 - equals text slash JavaScript so you
05:53 - don't necessarily need to include that
05:55 - but this is just gonna specify exactly
05:58 - what language you're writing it because
05:59 - you can do scripts for other types of
06:00 - things inside of HTML so inside of here
06:03 - is where we're always going to be
06:04 - writing our JavaScript code unless we're
06:06 - putting it in a separate file and
06:07 - importing it which we'll talk about
06:08 - later so here allows us to actually you
06:11 - know start writing a different language
06:13 - so not HTML now we're going to write in
06:14 - JavaScript so what's the first thing
06:17 - that we need to demonstrate in
06:18 - JavaScript that we can do well the first
06:20 - thing that I like to demonstrate is
06:21 - simply the console so just like in any
06:25 - other language the first thing you
06:26 - typically do is you print something out
06:27 - and the you know do the holo world
06:29 - application so let's do that
06:31 - so what console adult log is gonna do is
06:33 - simply put a log or log a message to the
06:37 - HTML console or whatever the console is
06:39 - in our browser it says hello world
06:40 - console means we're not actually
06:42 - interacting with the HTML page we're
06:44 - interacting with the console and you
06:46 - typically do this for debugging purposes
06:47 - and not in a production environment
06:50 - so anyways let's have a look at what
06:51 - this actually does and how we can even
06:53 - see the console up here so if i refresh
06:55 - this page obviously nothing's happening
06:57 - but we've put console.log hello world
07:00 - inside of our script X how do we see
07:01 - this well we need to open up the console
07:04 - now this might be a little bit different
07:05 - depending on what web browser you're
07:06 - using but in chrome it's pretty easy to
07:08 - do this right click anywhere on the page
07:10 - and click inspect this is going to be
07:12 - probably similar steps for edge or any
07:14 - other web browsers like that you need to
07:15 - inspect element you'll see that we get
07:17 - something that pops up on the side or
07:19 - maybe below your webpage and it says
07:21 - elements and then there's some place
07:22 - that says console now my case I'm just
07:24 - gonna zoom in so you guys can actually
07:25 - see this you can notice at the top of my
07:28 - console here it says hello world with an
07:30 - exclamation point and says that that
07:31 - came from tutorial HTML colon 5 which
07:34 - stands for line and that is the
07:36 - most basic step on how we actually log
07:39 - something to the console now that's
07:41 - great but what if I want to actually
07:42 - display something on my web page well
07:45 - what I can do if I want to show
07:46 - something on my web page is use
07:48 - something called document now this is
07:50 - kind of the main thing that we need to
07:51 - understand here in JavaScript we have
07:53 - two main areas that we can kind of write
07:55 - to we have log or sorry console and we
07:58 - have document console is gonna be
08:00 - something that you know the user doesn't
08:01 - see it's in the background it's in that
08:03 - console tab whereas document is actually
08:05 - referencing the HTML document itself
08:07 - which means we can write information
08:08 - directly into the HTML document now when
08:12 - we want to write to some HTML directly
08:14 - into the document what we do is document
08:16 - dot write and then inside of here we're
08:18 - gonna put quotation marks and we're
08:19 - gonna put whatever it is that we want to
08:21 - write so in this case maybe I want to
08:22 - write in h1 tag like this that says
08:26 - hello then we'll do h1 hello like that
08:29 - and what this is actually gonna do is
08:31 - write this directly to the document now
08:33 - there's something that I would notice I
08:34 - didn't mention here so I'm gonna add it
08:36 - quickly whenever we write a line in
08:38 - JavaScript we need to add a semicolon at
08:41 - the end of it this simply ends work
08:42 - terminate the current line which means
08:45 - get ready to read the next instruction
08:47 - that we're gonna have below this now
08:49 - this is kind of the basics this is
08:50 - involved in a lot of different languages
08:52 - but there will be some specific lines we
08:54 - don't need semicolons for but I'll talk
08:55 - about those when we get to them I also
08:57 - want to mention what I'm doing in here
08:59 - notice that I put this in quotation
09:01 - marks and that I haven't just left them
09:02 - like this and then what I putting in
09:04 - quotation marks that actually ends up
09:05 - changing colors now this is important
09:07 - and typically when we're writing things
09:09 - inside of here and we're just typing
09:10 - them in we need to put them inside of
09:12 - quotation marks we're going to talk
09:14 - about this more in detail in later
09:15 - videos as we go into datatypes and all
09:17 - that but just understand that for right
09:18 - now if you're gonna be writing something
09:19 - or logging something you're gonna need
09:21 - to put it inside of quotation marks for
09:23 - that to work and what I've done here is
09:24 - simply put some h1 tags hello and I've
09:27 - written this into the document a lot an
09:28 - exclamation point so we can see the
09:30 - difference here and now what I'm going
09:31 - to do is just refresh the page and show
09:33 - you what happens so now you can see that
09:35 - we actually don't get anything in the
09:36 - console because we haven't logged
09:37 - anything and we get hello directly
09:39 - underneath it with an exclamation point
09:41 - because that's what we wrote so we can
09:43 - actually write you know HTML directly to
09:46 - the document by doing that now I'm just
09:48 - gonna show you two more things that we
09:50 - can do with console with the console and
09:52 - then we're gonna end this video and move
09:53 - into some more advanced stuff in the
09:54 - next one so just like we can log some
09:57 - information to the console so console
09:59 - dot log you know like hello this is a
10:03 - long we can also do some other kinds of
10:05 - things in the consoles we can do what's
10:07 - called an error and what's called a
10:08 - warning so I'm going to show you both of
10:10 - them so just like we have console dot
10:11 - log we also have console dot warn and
10:14 - you'll see the difference in this one
10:15 - immediately I'm just gonna call this
10:16 - warning exclamation point
10:18 - now what's gonna happen when i refresh
10:21 - the page is we get this little icon that
10:23 - pops up and says that we have a warning
10:25 - and it tells us where this warning came
10:27 - from and what line it was at so that can
10:29 - be useful sometimes when you're creating
10:31 - an application and you want to warn the
10:33 - user that they're doing something that
10:34 - maybe they shouldn't do or not the user
10:36 - but you know yourself if you're
10:37 - developing this and you want to look at
10:38 - it that can be useful to do as well and
10:40 - you get that little icon popping up and
10:42 - we can also do a console dot error which
10:45 - is a little bit more strict than a
10:47 - warning and we'll just say this is an
10:50 - error like that and remember our
10:52 - semicolon at the end of that line so
10:54 - let's run this we get this is an error
10:55 - tutorial eight and you
10:57 - we get this little X here and you notice
10:59 - this is obviously a stronger kind of
11:00 - statement than this morning so log
11:02 - warning error and this was document
11:05 - right and those are kind of the
11:06 - fundamental things that you know we
11:08 - always learned when we started learning
11:09 - a language how do we do logs how do we
11:12 - write some stuff and obviously this
11:13 - document right to write some HTML
11:15 - directly to the document so I mean that
11:17 - has kind of been my first geometry
11:19 - tutorial as always let me know what you
11:21 - guys want to see for the rest of this
11:23 - tutorial series in the comments down
11:24 - below I plan on making this one quite
11:26 - long as I'd like to understand kind of
11:28 - some more advanced aspects of JavaScript
11:30 - so as always people like if you like
11:32 - this video subscribe to the channel for
11:34 - more and I will see you guys in the next
11:35 - job script tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to a brand new series on JavaScript for beginners what I'm gonna do right now is give you a brief overview of what you can expect from this tutorial series a little bit about my background with JavaScript so you know if you'd like to watch this series or not and then we're gonna get into some basic environment setup and talk about how we can run our JavaScript code but first of all I feel like I need to mention this if you guys have looked at my channel you realize that almost everything on there is Python with the exception for a few Java videos not JavaScript Java now I actually know JavaScript I used to do it a lot when I was younger so maybe 14 or 15 I'm 19 now for any of you that are wondering and I really wanted to get back into it because it's growing as a language rapidly and there's a lot that you can do if you know both Python and JavaScript you can move into kind of a full stack developer position where you understand the frontend and you understand the backend so that's an advantage for any of you guys if you do know another programming language especially something like Python or kind of a backend web technology if you learned something like JavaScript that is really a complementing skill and that's the reason that I want to teach it to you guys but what really is JavaScript now I'm sure some of you guys don't really understand exactly how it works or what it is but essentially javascript is a language that is run primarily from your browser so unlike python which is typically a serverside language which is gonna run off a linux server and be responsible for doing the backend of websites and HTTP requests and all of that when you have JavaScript what it's gonna be doing is dealing with some frontend information so it's actually gonna run directly in this chrome web browser and it's gonna be responsible for your interaction with the page so essentially say I click a button so here download for Windows we're going to talk about this in a second that will run a JavaScript function that will actually you know download this and same thing with a lot of other features on this page and just other web pages in general you see any kind of games made in the browser chances are they might actually be made with JavaScript and there's just a lot of things that you do kind of frontend wise using that technology now this is great it makes this language super flexible and really great to learn because this essentially means you can develop for any platform if you know JavaScript whereas something like Python you know you need to make sure you have a compiler on that actual computer and it might not necessarily work depending on what when you're in where as JavaScript all you need is a web browser to actually run that code which means essentially one JavaScript will work on any device any computer so long as it has a web browser that being said javascript is also a massively growing language a lot of high tech companies are looking for people that know JavaScript and it's a really easy way to get into kind of web development actually secure a job especially if you don't have an education or a background in computer size or software engineering or something like that so anyways that's enough for kind of the information about that sorry if I've bored any of you guys but now let's get into the environment set up start writing a basic hello world program and then we'll end off at the end of there and move into some more advanced stuff in the next video so the first thing that we need to do if we're gonna write JavaScript is we need a place to write it now what I'm gonna be using is sublime text which is just a pretty standard text editor which will allow us to have some syntax highlighting and some autocomplete while we write our code so I'm gonna leave a link in the description but if you need to start off by downloading this editor you can also use any other

to create a new file which is actually gonna be an HTML file so what I'm gonna do in subline here is go to file new file you'll see it pops up as untitled as a new tab you can go file save as or simply hit ctrl s and then type in the name of your file make sure I'm just going to call this one tutorial 1 although I do already have that file make sure it says all files and add your extension of dot HTML the reason we're gonna do this is because it the way we're actually going to look at our dot JavaScript code is by running it through the browser which involves us having an HTML file now you can see here I've already made one so I'm gonna kind of omit this step here but that's what you guys need to do now once we have this you should see tutorial one at the top here which is now actually gonna allow us to start writing some code that we can run in our browser now just notice though and I'm gonna try to find this folder wherever I had it so desktop JavaScript JavaScript tutorial that when you create a file that's dot HTML you should see the icon beside it change to be you know chrome or edge or whatever web browser you're using open Abul now what that essentially means is if I double click on this file you can see that is going to open it in my browser now for some reason that's not working for you what you can always do is type in the direct path to your file in your web browser and that will actually open it up and the reason we're gonna do this is because when we make changes to this HTML file will refresh our web browser and we'll see those changes effect here so this is kind of gonna be our console and our output our web browser where is where we're gonna be writing is inside of this actual text editor I'm gonna get started right away and I'm just gonna start doing some things you guys might be a little bit confused at first you've never seen this before but whenever we write two kind of JavaScript code we need to display it on an HTML page so the basic syntax for creating an HTML page is simply putting HTML tags and then you're gonna put these body tags like this now I'm not gonna focus too much on this syntax cuz it's pretty simple you can probably understand it fairly easily and I'm sure most of you know it but essentially open tags just simply have the word and then close tags have this slash afford the same word so this is our body tags this is our HTML tags our body tags are inside of our HTML tags now inside of body what we're gonna start by doing is just writing some basic HTML just to show you how some things work here so I'm gonna say h1 tags which stands for header 1 is hello now I'll demonstrate that when i refresh the page here hello pops up means everything's working you guys should test that as well to make sure everything is proper now that's great but how do we write JavaScript well when we want to write a script inside of our HTML what we can simply do is type script now nice for me in sublime text view when I hit enter it's automatically gonna fill in some options for me you can see we have the type equals text slash JavaScript so you don't necessarily need to include that but this is just gonna specify exactly what language you're writing it because you can do scripts for other types of things inside of HTML so inside of here is where we're always going to be writing our JavaScript code unless we're putting it in a separate file and importing it which we'll talk about later so here allows us to actually you know start writing a different language so not HTML now we're going to write in JavaScript so what's the first thing that we need to demonstrate in JavaScript that we can do well the first thing that I like to demonstrate is simply the console so just like in any other language the first thing you typically do is you print something out and the you know do the holo world application so let's do that so what console adult log is gonna do is simply put a log or log a message to the HTML console or whatever the console is in our browser it says hello world console means we're not actually interacting with the HTML page we're interacting with the console and you typically do this for debugging purposes and not in a production environment so anyways let's have a look at what this actually does and how we can even see the console up here so if i refresh this page obviously nothing's happening but we've put console.log hello world inside of our script X how do we see this well we need to open up the console now this might be a little bit different depending on what web browser you're using but in chrome it's pretty easy to do this right click anywhere on the page and click inspect this is going to be probably similar steps for edge or any other web browsers like that you need to inspect element you'll see that we get something that pops up on the side or maybe below your webpage and it says elements and then there's some place that says console now my case I'm just gonna zoom in so you guys can actually see this you can notice at the top of my console here it says hello world with an exclamation point and says that that came from tutorial HTML colon 5 which stands for line and that is the most basic step on how we actually log something to the console now that's great but what if I want to actually display something on my web page well what I can do if I want to show something on my web page is use something called document now this is kind of the main thing that we need to understand here in JavaScript we have two main areas that we can kind of write to we have log or sorry console and we have document console is gonna be something that you know the user doesn't see it's in the background it's in that console tab whereas document is actually referencing the HTML document itself which means we can write information directly into the HTML document now when we want to write to some HTML directly into the document what we do is document dot write and then inside of here we're gonna put quotation marks and we're gonna put whatever it is that we want to write so in this case maybe I want to write in h1 tag like this that says hello then we'll do h1 hello like that and what this is actually gonna do is write this directly to the document now there's something that I would notice I didn't mention here so I'm gonna add it quickly whenever we write a line in JavaScript we need to add a semicolon at the end of it this simply ends work terminate the current line which means get ready to read the next instruction that we're gonna have below this now this is kind of the basics this is involved in a lot of different languages but there will be some specific lines we don't need semicolons for but I'll talk about those when we get to them I also want to mention what I'm doing in here notice that I put this in quotation marks and that I haven't just left them like this and then what I putting in quotation marks that actually ends up changing colors now this is important and typically when we're writing things inside of here and we're just typing them in we need to put them inside of quotation marks we're going to talk about this more in detail in later videos as we go into datatypes and all that but just understand that for right now if you're gonna be writing something or logging something you're gonna need to put it inside of quotation marks for that to work and what I've done here is simply put some h1 tags hello and I've written this into the document a lot an exclamation point so we can see the difference here and now what I'm going to do is just refresh the page and show you what happens so now you can see that we actually don't get anything in the console because we haven't logged anything and we get hello directly underneath it with an exclamation point because that's what we wrote so we can actually write you know HTML directly to the document by doing that now I'm just gonna show you two more things that we can do with console with the console and then we're gonna end this video and move into some more advanced stuff in the next one so just like we can log some information to the console so console dot log you know like hello this is a long we can also do some other kinds of things in the consoles we can do what's called an error and what's called a warning so I'm going to show you both of them so just like we have console dot log we also have console dot warn and you'll see the difference in this one immediately I'm just gonna call this warning exclamation point now what's gonna happen when i refresh the page is we get this little icon that pops up and says that we have a warning and it tells us where this warning came from and what line it was at so that can be useful sometimes when you're creating an application and you want to warn the user that they're doing something that maybe they shouldn't do or not the user but you know yourself if you're developing this and you want to look at it that can be useful to do as well and you get that little icon popping up and we can also do a console dot error which is a little bit more strict than a warning and we'll just say this is an error like that and remember our semicolon at the end of that line so let's run this we get this is an error tutorial eight and you we get this little X here and you notice this is obviously a stronger kind of statement than this morning so log warning error and this was document right and those are kind of the fundamental things that you know we always learned when we started learning a language how do we do logs how do we write some stuff and obviously this document right to write some HTML directly to the document so I mean that has kind of been my first geometry tutorial as always let me know what you guys want to see for the rest of this tutorial series in the comments down below I plan on making this one quite long as I'd like to understand kind of some more advanced aspects of JavaScript so as always people like if you like this video subscribe to the channel for more and I will see you guys in the next job script tutorial
