so to start out probability we need to talk about events simple events compound events and sample space so the sample space is all the possible simple events in a simple event is simply a outcome of an action or an experiment that can't be broken down any further so if we're rolling a die that's the singular of dice in case you're curious and we've got six a sixsided die then the possible outcomes and this would be the the sample space the the possible outcomes are simple outcomes are rolling a one rolling a two rolling a three rolling four rolling a 5 or rolling a six and each of these is a simple event now it is possible also to talk about things called compound events and compound events would be something like rolling something larger than four right and in that event there are two possible ways that you can achieve that event right you could either roll five or a six or another possible compound event would be rolling an even number right in this case there's three possible ways to have that event occur okay so these are our sample spaces those are all of our simple outcomes and now we can start talking about probability so if we're rolling one of those sixsided excited dies can we calculate this let's say the probability of rolling a 1 this notation here P parentheses is used to denote probability of and so this is the probability of rolling a 1 now a basic probability can be computed as the number of ways that this event can occur divided by the total number of possible events so for this particular case how many ways can we roll a 1 right remember that our sample space was the how many of those events are rolling a 1 well only one of them how many total simple events are there how large is our sample space 6 so there is a 1/6 probability of rolling a 1 on the die now you could also write that as a percent it's about 17% but we'll probably be using fractions most of the time because it's a little easier now how about in this one the probability of rolling a number bigger than 4 how many ways can that event occur well there's two numbers that are bigger than 4 so there's two outcomes that correspond to the event out of how many total outcomes are there six and this is a fraction so we can reduce it and so there's a one out of three or onethird probability if you roll a die of rolling a number bigger than 4 so now let's continue talking about sort of basic probabilities let's say you have a back with 20 cherries 14 of which are sweet and 6 our if you pick a cherry at random what's the probability it will be sweet so again we say how many ways can out of all of the outcomes how many ways can our event occur in this case in order to be sweet there are 14 ways that we could end up with a sweet cherry out of how many possible outcomes well there's 20 possible cherries that we could have picked so there's a 14 out of 20 or 7 out of 10 or if you wanted to you could also say 70% chance or probability that our cherry will be sweet now that is of course assuming that all of our cherries are actually the same in shape and size if they happen to look different then then that might not be the case let's look at another one let's find the probability of randomly drawing one card from a standard deck of cards and getting an ace now if you're not familiar with a deck of cards here's what they look like there are four suits this top one is called a spade and then diamonds clubs and hearts there are the numbers 2 through 10 an ace which sort of corresponds to the 1 and then these 3 are called face cards the jack the Queen and the king so the question was compute the probability of randomly drawing one card from a deck and getting an ace well again we would need to say how many ways can that event occur out of all the possibilities so there are 13 different cards for each of four suits so there are 52 possible cards in the deck out of those how many of them are aces 1 2 3 4 and so there is a 4 out of 52 or 1 13 or if you wanted it decimals you could say 0.076 9 or about seven point six nine percent probability or chance of randomly drawing a card from the deck and getting an ace if you pull a random card from a deck of playing cards what's the probability viz not a heart now this is what's called a complimentary event and because of the knot here so we're looking for the probability of something not happening so sometimes we like if E is our event then we'll use this notation a bar for the complement of that event which is a fancy way of saying that that event doesn't happen so this is saying he doesn't happen now because the probability of something happening is 100 percent or 1 then the probability of an event happening and the probability of the event not happening need to add up to 1 need to add up to 100% and so the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening so the probability of not getting a heart is 1 minus the probability of getting a heart and what is the probability of getting a heart well there are 13 hearts there are 13 hearts out of the 52 cards in the deck so 1 minus 1/4 and that would be 3/4 so there's a 3/4 or 75% probability of not getting a heart and these are complementary events most we flipped a coin and rolled to die and we wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin and a six on the die now notice that we could list out all the possible outcomes here we could get a head and then a one a had a two ahead a three ahead of four ahead a five ahead a six right on the coin and then on the die or we could get tails and one tails and two tails and three tails in four tails in five tails and six and so there are a total of twelve possible outcomes here how many of them would have a head on the coin and a six on the die well only one of them right one out of those twelve and so there's a 1/12 probability of rolling a six on the die and getting a head on the coin now you might also notice that the probability of getting a head on the coin is one out of two the probability being a six on the die is one out of six and if we were to multiply those we would get the 1/12 and it turns out to be true that the probability of both events happening is the probability of a time's the probability of B if a and B are what's called independent now independence means that the result of the head of the coin flip does not depend or affect the result of the roll of the die let's look at some examples suppose we toss a fair coin the first event is the first toss and the second event is whether or not the second toss is a heads are these independent events yes these are independent independent why because the result of the second coin toss does not depend upon the first one the second toss has no idea whether the first toss was a was a head or not how about the two events it will rain tomorrow in Houston and it will rain tomorrow in Galveston which is a city near Houston these are not independent because the cities are close together they're likely to have similar similar weather patterns and so these are not independent events how about you draw a card from the deck and then draw a second card without replacing the first this is again not independent because the result of the first draw the will affect the result of the second draw for example if we're asking about let's say the probability of getting an ace the likelihood of getting an ace on the second draw depends upon whether or not we got an ace on the first draw so these are not independent but if two things are are independent then we can go ahead and use that multiplication idea so for example in your drawer you have six ten pairs of socks six of which are white and seven tshirts three of which are white if you randomly reach in and pull out a pair of socks and tshirt what's the probability both are white well the probability of white socks is let's say there's six white out of ten pairs right the probability of a white tee is let's hear three of them are white out of ten so the probability that both of them will be white will simply be the likelihood of the first being white times the second likely to the second one being white because the probabilities oops that's not right it's not out of ten it's out of seven right three out of seven sorry so the probability of both of them being white is this and we can simply multiply them because the probability of pulling out of the tshirt being white is not dependent upon the probability of the socks being white so we can go ahead and multiply that that's 18 out of 70 in other words there are 70 possible outcomes and eighteen of them involve both of them being white and of course we can reduce that fraction down to nine thirty fifths so that's the probability that both of them are white later on we'll look at how to deal with a non independent case now suppose we flipped a coin and roll to die and we wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin or or a six on the die now this is different than the problems we did earlier where we're looking at the probability of both of the end so of course the easiest way to do this for a simple problem like this is to say well how many of these outcomes these twelve outcomes how many of them have a head on the coin or a six on the die and there are one two three four five six seven outcomes that have either a head on the coin or a six on the die now could we have figure that out another way by sort of looking at the two events separately so what's the probability of getting a head on the getting a head on the coin so the probability of a head is onehalf or in twelfths right that'd be six out of 12 six of the outcomes have a head what's the probability of rolling a six on the die well there's two well that's one out of six right one roll out of the six possibilities on the die in terms of our total outcomes here two of them have a six on the die and notice if we hadn't just added these two up we get too many outcomes we'd get eight out of twelve why because we're counting one two three four five six for the heads and we're counting one two for the sixes but we've counted this value twice so in order to compensate for that we're going to have to subtract out that value that we double counted so we're going to subtract out the probability of heads and a six and there's 1 out of 12 there and if we combine that 6 plus 2 is 8 minus 1 is 7 twelfths and we get the same answer that we had there so our basic rule here is that the probability of A or B is the probability of a plus the probability of B minus the probability of both and we again we got a subtract out that and so though we're not double counting it let's see if we can use this now supposed to draw one card from a standard deck what's the probability that we get a queen or a king well the probability of a queen is let's here there's four of them out of the 52 cards in the deck what's the probability of a king 4 out of 52 what's the probability that the card is both a queen and the king well none is impossible for a card to be both a king and a queen it's one of the other and so the probability of queen or king here is just 4 out of 52 plus 4 out of 52 minus 0 is 8 out of 52 is our is our probability there now the reason that we ended up with this 0 here is because these two events the probability of getting a queen and probability of getting a king are mutually exclusive there's no overlaps and so in this simple case in this case of mutually exclusive it turns out that the probability of the probability of getting a queen or king is just the probabilities of the queen plus the probability of the king again because they're mutually exclusive and there's no overlap now that's not always the case of course so in our second problem here what's the probability that we get a red card or a king the probability of a red card is oh let's here there are Oh half the deck is red so that would be 26 out of the 52 what's the probability of a king that's 4 out of 52 what's the probability that's red and the King now here we do have overlap because there are two red kings and so for the probability of red or a king we're gonna have to add up the two individual probabilities and then subtract away the overlap which leaves us with a probability of 28 out of 52 for the probability of getting a red card or a king so here we have a table showing the number of number of survey subjects who have received and not received a speeding ticket in the last year and the color of their car and we're gonna find the probability that if we were to choose one of these people our random that they've have had that the person has a red car and got a speeding ticket and then secondly has a red car or got a speeding ticket now if you look at the table here there's basically four different categories here we got speeding ticket and red car no speeding ticket and red car speeding ticket not Reds no speeding ticket not red and then we have totals for each of the columns totals for each the rows and then the total total of everyone surveyed so for the first question where it says has a red car and got a speeding ticket how many people got both had a red car and got a speeding ticket in this case there are 15 of them so 15 people both had a red car and got a speeding ticket out of how many total people out of 665 total people so that's the probability of having a red car and getting a speeding ticket now these are dependent events and so we really have to work off the table it would not be correct to find the probability of having a red car the probability of speeding and just multiply them now how about for the next one so here we're trying to find the probability that they have a red car or getting us got getting a speeding ticket now there's a couple ways that we can go about this the easiest honestly is to just add up all the possibilities so let's see here these people got a speeding ticket these people have a red car so we have a total of 45 plus 15 plus 135 is a hundred and ninety five total people who either got a speeding ticket or up a red car and so our probability would be 195 out of 665 now we could have also done this the sort of longer formulaic way and said well let's look at the probability that they got a speeding ticket that's 60 out of 665 and let's add to that the probability that they have a red car that's 150 out of 665 and then subtract the duplicates right subtract those that have both right our end probability here and if we do this we'll get exactly the same answer but wouldn't we have a small table like this it's probably just as easy to just count up the possibilities so what is the probability that two cards drawn at random from a deck of cards will both be aces now you note the probability of pulling one card in getting an ace is four out of out of 52 and so it's really tempting to say the probability of getting an ace and another ace is 4 out of 52 times 4 out of 52 right using our multiplication rule now unfortunately this is not gonna work why because these two events are not independent because after we pull out our first card so after we pull out the first ace it changes the not only the number of cards in the deck but also the number of aces in the deck right so now for our first draw write probability of ace on the first draw is still 4 out of 52 but for our second draw this is going to change this is now the probability of an ace on the second draw second draw given and we use this little bar for a given given an ace on the first draw and this is what's called a conditional probability so here how many possible outcomes how many possible cards can one draw on the second draw there's only 51 cards left and so it's going to be out of 51 now how many aces are left there are only three aces left now and so our probability ends up being 12 out of 26 52 or in other words 1 out of 221 rather than the 4 out of 52 times 4 out of 52 ok so again this is called a conditional probability now let's look at another case let's find the probability that a die rolled shows a 6 and given so again this is a conditional probability given that a flip coin shows ahead so this is the probability of a six on a die given a head on a coin now in this case we need to ask ourselves are these two events independent and the answer is yes so in other words this in this particular case it doesn't matter why doesn't it matter because these are independent events so the probability of rolling on us the six on a die is the same as always it is one out of six let's look at one more case now let's look at a table of values here these are the speeding ticket folks so let's find the probability that they have a ticket given that they have a red car so now we're given that they have a red car so we know right away that we're only talking about these hundred and fifty people so we're only talking about out of these hundred and fifty people now out of those 150 people with a red car so we already know that how many of them got a ticket well 15 of them got a ticket so that's 15 out of 150 or one out of ten or ten percent of people with a red car also had a ticket now different question now is what's the probability that they have a red car given that they have a ticket now this is not the same thing because now we're limiting ourselves to these 60 people so we have 60 people total who got a speeding ticket how many of them had a red car 15 of them had a red car so 15 out of 60 or 1/4 or 25% of people with a speeding ticket had red cars right so these are the conditional probabilities and it is important to notice here that the order here does matter it does matter which piece of information you're being given so let's look at a couple more conditional probabilities suppose you pull two cards out of the deck what is the probability that both are spades so the probability that the first card is a spade well let's see there are 13 spades out of the 52 cards in the deck so that's the probability that the first card is a spade so now what's the probability that the second card ii is a spade given that the first was a spade right in order for both cards to come out spades the first is gonna have to be a spade and the second and so what's the probability that the second one is a spade given the first was well in this case given that the first one was a spade then there's now one less card in the deck and one less Spade in the deck and so 12 out of 51 is the probability of the second one being a spade so if I want to find the probability that both are a spade I'm going to use the conditional probability version of the multiplication rule which says that the probability of the first event happening times the probability of the second event happening given that the first happened so in this case 13 out of 52 for the first Spade 12 out of 51 for the second Spade gives us a probability oopsey gives us a probability of a hundred and fiftysix out of 26 52 or one out of 17 or about 5.9 percent probability of getting two spades and when we draw two cards so get another one if you draw two cards from the deck what's the probability that you'll get an ace of diamonds and a black card now this one's a little trickier because the events are different so there's two different ways that this could happen either we get it that we do the probability of the ace of diamonds then the black card and then separately we need to consider the probability of getting a black card than the ace of diamonds because it's sort of hard to think about putting those two cases together so here we're gonna find the probability of the ace of diamonds then the probability of getting a black card given that we already pulled the ace of diamonds and then for this case we're going to find the probability of getting a black card then for the second event the probability of getting the ace of diamonds given that we already pulled a black card okay so first case here what's the probability that we pull the ace of diamonds well there's only one of them out of the deck so one out of 52 how many ways could we pull a black card and given that the first card was the ace of diamonds now given that the first card is an ace of diamonds there's one less card in the deck but diamonds are not black so there are still 26 black cards in the deck so our probability here ends up being 26 out of 26 52 is one out of a hundred and two here the probability of getting a black card on the first draw is 26 out of 52 here the probability of getting a ace of diamonds given that the first card is black if the first card was black then there's one less card in the deck but we know the ace of diamonds is still there so there's still one of them and so we end up with 26 out of 26 52 is one out of 102 so in both cases the probability is 1 out of 102 these are two different ways that the same result could happen so we need to add these together and so the total probability of getting an ace of diamonds and a black card is the sum of those two out of 102 or 1 out of 51 so this looks at sort of an important application of conditional probability so here we have a home pregnancy test that was given to women and then pregnancy is verified through blood tests and then this table shows the home test result up here and then whether they're actually pregnant or not down here so we're going to compute two different conditional probabilities first the probability that they're not pregnant given that they have a positive test result so this is you know you have a positive test result and then what's the likelihood that you're not actually pregnant so so here we're given that we have a positive test results who are limiting ourselves to these 75 people and of them five are not pregnant and that's about 6.7% so there's about a 6.7% chance here that there that this person is not actually pregnant given that they have a positive test result now let's look at the next one which is the probability of a positive test result given that they're not pregnant so here's somebody who's here's all nineteen people who are not pregnant and out of them five of them have a positive test result so this is what's called a false positive this is when somebody who doesn't actually have the condition gets a positive result anyway so it's an accidental positive result and you'll notice that this probability is substantially different this is about twenty six point three percent here yeah and it's it's really interesting to note these results are quite different so even though this test has a 26 percent false positive rate that means 26 percent of the time it it will tell somebody who's not pregnant that they're pregnant that that is not the same probability as once you actually have a positive test result whether or not it is whether or not you're actually pregnant now admittedly this data is made up but this basic idea does hold true for for for test all pretty much all tests of disease and it all depends upon the incidence rate how likely it is that you actually have either the disease or in this case the likelihood of being pregnant so now we're gonna look at a sort of more complicated testing situation and this one fouls doctors up so let's look we'll walk our way through this so suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1 percent that is it afflicts 0.1 percent of the population in other words the probability of having this disease is 0.001 0.1% so a test has been devised to detect this disease the test does not produce false negatives in other words anyone who has the disease will test positive for it in other words and the probability of a positive test given that the person has the disease is 100% they will definitely test positive if they have the disease but the false positive rate is is 5% this means that the probability that somebody will test positive if they do not have the disease yeah is is is 5% so 5% of people will test positive even if they don't have the disease so now if we randomly pick someone what's the probability that they actually have the disease in other words what is the probability of the disease given that they test positive and as we saw before this is not going to be the same as the probability of a positive test given the disease so let's work our way through this so here I've broken down all that information again so to think about this most simply let's imagine that we have 1,000 people now because the disease incidence rate is 0.001 or one out of a thousand then that tells me that out of these 1,000 people one of them will have the disease and 999 of them will not have the disease on average now if they have the disease we know that they're gonna test positive and so this one person is gonna have a positive test result there are no people who have the disease and test negative but now out of these 99 people who do not have the disease we know that 5% of them are gonna test positive so 5% of our 999 people is 49.95 or about 50 so let's just call it 50 so 50 people are going to test positive who don't actually have the disease and the other 949 aren't going to test negative so that leaves us 51 people testing positive for the disease now remember what we're really interested in is what is the probability that you have the disease given that you tested positive well now we have enough information to figure that out how many people tested positive 51 how many of them actually have the disease 1 and that comes out to about 1.96 percent so remarkably even though this test has no false negatives and only a 5% false positives rate if you test positive for this disease there's only a 2% chance that you actually have it and that should be surprising but that is the result of our probability so now we have another disease that has an incidence rate of two percent the false negative rate is 10 percent false positive rate is 1 percent so let's compute the probability that a person who test positive actually has the disease so there's two ways to do this let's start with the easy way and that is to create a table so now we got positive negative disease no disease now for simplicity let's imagine that we have some nice round number of people let's go with something pretty big like 10,000 just to make sure our numbers work out okay so now our we have a 2% incidence rate so out of these 10,000 people 2 percent of them or 200 of them will have the disease meanwhile the other 98 hundred of them will will not have the disease now we have a false negative rate of 10% and so that tells us that that tells us that 10% of these 200 are going to incorrectly test negative meanwhile the other 180 will correctly test positive meanwhile we have a false positive rate of 1% and that means that out of our people who don't have the disease 1% of them or 98 of them are going to test are going to test positive meanwhile the other let's see 8 9702 of them are going to correctly test negative so notice these these here and these 98 people here and these 20 people here are our errors right so altogether we have 278 people testing positive so if we wanted to find out the probability that they have the disease given that they test positive then then we have 278 people who tested positive of them 180 have the disease and that comes out to be about sixty four point seven percent so sixtyfour about 65 percent of people who test positive in this case will actually have the disease now there's another way we could go about this problem and that would be using using Bayes rule so let's take a look at what doesn't see what that would look like so Bayes rule says that the probability of a given B is the probability of a time's the probability of B given a over the probability of a time's the probability of B given a plus the probability of a compliment times the probability of B given a compliment now in terms of our disease that would look like look like this so now we could start filling in all this information so what is the probability that they have the disease well that is in this case two percent right it's a two percent incidence rate what's the probability that they have a get if a positive test given that they have the disease well there's a false negative rate of 10% which means there's a 90 percent chance that they'll test positive given they have the disease down here we got let's here again probability of disease probability of positive given disease probability of no disease would be 98 percent and then what's the probability that we test positive given that we don't have the disease that's our 1 percent false positive rate and if we compute all that out turns out to be 0.01 8 over 0.02 78 which comes out to the same 64.7% we came up use with using our nice little table so this Bayes formula has its advantages but for a lot of cases working off the table like we did first is going to be a simpler approach so now we're going to talk about counting for a while and you're probably thinking counting I don't want to count but we're gonna talk about counting really large amounts of stuff so here's an example suppose a restaurant you have three choices of appetizer five choices for a main course and you're allowed to choose exactly one from each category how many different meal options do you have well there's several ways to approach this one way that I like is called a decision tree so you start out here and say okay I have how many choices for my appetizer I have three choices so I have one two three different directions I could go I could go soup direction salad direction and then breadsticks direction then at each of those points I now have to decide them on a main course and for each of those I now have one two three four five choices emanating out and so how many total choices do I have now you'll notice that there are five choices here another five here another five there we end up with a total of fifteen choices and that is how many meal options we have now you may have noticed that where does that 15 come from well it's three choices for our first decision times the five choices for the second decision because we have three live these little branch Eitri things so we end up multiplying those choices together and that's exactly how this works so let's look at another one suppose there's 21 novels and 18 volumes of poetry that you own a reading list for an English course how many different ways can you select one novel in one volume of poetry well there's 21 choices for the novel eighteen choices for the poetry we multiply those together and that gives us a total of three hundred and seventy eight possibilities so another one now suppose that we're at a restaurant and we have three choices for the appetizer we have five choices for a main course and now to choices for dessert if we're allowed to choose exactly one of them one of each of them then we would have 3 times 5 times 2 equals 30 choices now it is important to note here that this is assuming that we actually pick one from each of them that we're not gonna you know not pick one of them okay one more so suppose quiz consists of three true or false questions how many ways can student answer this well so we have three questions each of those questions has two choices right so the first question all right so three questions the first question there are two choices for the second question there are two choices but the third question there are two choices and so altogether there are two to the third or eight different ways that a student could answer a three question true or false quiz so how many different ways could the letters of the word math be rearranged to form a fourlevel letter code word so we have four letters and we can ask ourselves how many choices do we have for the first letter well we have four choices how many choices do we have for the second letter now we're rearranging the letters so we can't use any letters twice and so there would be only be three choices for the second letter how about for the third letter two choices and then there's only one choice for the last letter because there's only one letter left and so we'd end up with 24 different code words that we could create out of the letters of math now notice that's different than saying you slit letters from math and you can have repeats if we could have repeats we'd have 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 or 4 to the fourth different code words and that'd be 256 different code words we have a lot more if we allowed repeats but here we're not allowing repeats we end up with 24 possibilities now this sort of computation is done so often that we come up with a shorthand notation for it called the factorial factorial in general the idea is that n factorial means that number times one last times one last times keep on going down all the way down to till you get down to one so it's multiplying numbers in decreasing order until you get down to one so this is 4 factorial 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 okay let's look at another problem how many ways can five different door prizes be distributed among five people so we've got 5 people and we got 5 different prizes so how many choices are there for the first person 5 how about for the second 4 3 2 and 1 or in other words 5 factorial and if you can find the factorial button on your calculator and will make your life a little easier here then hitting multiplication 5 times 4 times 2 times 1 but either way we come up with 120 different ways to distribute those prizes now let's look at a slightly different one charity event is attended by 25 people and we're gonna give away three prizes and there are different prizes no person receives more than one prize how many different ways can we distribute these so we only have three prizes and the order does matter because it matters who gets the hundred dollar prize versus who gets the twentyfive dollar prize so how many choices do we have for the first prize for the hundred dollar prize well there's 25 people so there are 25 possibilities for that prize how about for the second one for the 25 dollar prize well there's no repeats right no person receives more than one prize so there's only 24 people now and for the last prize for the $10.00 prize there's 23 people and so we end up with 13 thousand eight hundred different ways that these prizes could be awarded and you'll notice that this looks awfully similar to our our factorial that we were doing earlier but a but truncated right where we don't go all the way down to one and it turns out that there is a nice way to represent this which will look about look at in a minute let's look at one more first dumb eight sprinters have made it to the Olympic finals 100 meters how many different ways could the gold silver and bronze be awarded or how many different possible outcomes are there basically so similar to the last problem there are eight possibilities for the first place for the gold there are seven possibilities for the for the silver and there are six possibilities for the bronze that gives us a total of 336 different orderings or 336 different outcomes so I have nine paintings in room to display only four of them on the wall the time how many different ways could I do this so I'm going to presume that ordering matters here in other words I care what order the pictures are in and and that I can't use the same picture twice so we certainly could answer this question by saying how many choices do I have for the first one the second one the third one and the fourth one and we could certainly do that and end up with our answer 3000 24 different orderings now to make that we're gonna try to come up with another way to do this and this thing is what we call a permutation a permutation is a rearrangement of items where order matters and we're selecting from a group the usual notation is n P R where n is the is the number of items number of choices and then R is is how many pick how many we're gonna pick the number we pick so R is the number we pick from our total number of choices so this problem here would be 9 P 4 we have nine choices and from them we're going to pick four of them and we're going to look at all the possible orderings or permutations of them now there's several ways to calculate a permutation one is the way we just did it which is to just multiply 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 another way to do it is to use factorials you'll notice that this looks a lot like 9 factorial which is 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 but it's not as much right we don't have the 5 4 3 2 1 so we can get rid of that by dividing by 5 factorial which will then reduce all of those away leaving us with just the 9 8 7 six so if we have NPR it turns out we can compute that using factorials as n factorial over n minus R factorial so in this case when we had 9p and four that would be nine factorial over nine minus four factorial or other words nine factorial over five factorial as we just saw here the other way you can do this is if your calculator happens is to have a permutations feature on it you can ask it what is 9p for and it should spit out this 3024 answer for you now this is kind of handy when we're looking at larger numbers so let's look at one more example how many ways can a four person Executive Committee president vice president secretary treasurer be selected from a sixteen member Board of Directors so in this case there are sixteen choices sixteen members on the board of director and from them we're looking at permutations of size four so we're looking at orderings again order matters here because it matters who's chosen as president and vice president versus the other way around so 16 people we're picking four of them order matters 16 P 4 now again we could either compute this as 16 times 15 times 14 times 13 or 16 factorial over 16 minus 4 is 12 factorial or we could pull out our calculators either way we're gonna end up with 40 2680 and different executive committees so a charity event now is intended by 25 people at which through 3 $50 gift certificates are going to be given away as door prizes how many ways could we do this now this is notice that all three prizes aren't the same here so we could go with the basic idea of saying okay we have three people there are twentyfive possibilities for the first prize 24 for the second and twentythird for the third or in other words there are thirteen thousand eight hundred different ways that we could pick three people from our crowd now let's imagine now that we have three people a we're just gonna call them a B and C for simplicity so if a B and C were picked first second third that would be one of these 13,800 possibilities but if B was picking picked first then a then C then this would also be one of those six one one of those 13,800 possibilities but really these are the same outcome in fact there are six different outcomes there are six different outcomes that are all really the same outcome because the order doesn't matter here it doesn't matter who's chosen first second or third so in order to compensate for this we end up needing to take our thirteen thousand eight hundred different permutations and divide it by six to come up with twenty three thousand what are called combinations combinations are what we call it when order doesn't matter in other words it doesn't matter who is chosen first now the way we can sort of generalize this is the idea of the total number of permutations so NP are divided by well what did where did this six come from that's the number of different ways of orderings three people so in this it was three people three people three possibilities for the first person 2 for the second one for the third that is 3 P 3 or in general this would be R P R and this is how we define a combination or how we calculate combinations and we denote combinations with n oops n see R so this is from N and choices we're choosing this R of them but the order doesn't matter so we're going to count ABC the same thing as BAC this is one way to compute it the other way is using factorials and that looks something like this so now let's look at let's look at an example so a group of four students is to be chosen from a 35 member class to represent the class on the Student Council now order doesn't matter here because they're all just representatives so in this case from our 35 students we're going to choose four of them but the order doesn't matter so this is a combination so using our sort of first version here the permutation version we're thinking from 35 from 35 how many different ways can I pick four people if order didn't matter and then I'm going to divide that by the number of ways of ordering four people so this says from 35 people I need to pick four so I got 35 choices for the first person 34 for the second 33 for the third and 32 for this last choice and I'm gonna divide that by the different ways of ordering for people so then I have four choices for the first person third three for the second two for the third and one for the last so this is the total number of ways of choosing four people if order matters divided by the number of ways of ordering them which takes care of the order it gives me 50 mm 60 different combinations so the Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members and suppose that it was 15 Republicans and 14 Democrats the defense subcommittee which is a smaller group of that consists of 19 members 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats how many different ways could the members of the defense subcommittee be chosen from among the 29 senators on the Appropriations Committee so you can see that for thee we're going to look separately at the Republicans or the Democrats here okay so forward the Republicans we have 15 Republicans overall and 10 of them are going to end up on this subcommittee so from the 15 Republicans we're going to pick 10 of them in order does not matter so we're going to use combinations and that turns out to be three thousand and three for our Democrats we have 14 Democrats altogether nine of them are going to end up on our committee so 14 choose nine and that comes out to be two thousand and two different ways but then how about for our entire committee here so so now imagine that we let's put all the Republican choices on little slips of red paper so we've got three thousand and three pieces of red paper and then we put all 2002 Democratic choices on little slips of blue paper and threw them all in a hat how many ways could we pick one red slip in one blue slip well there's three thousand and three possibilities for choosing a Republican contingent and there's two thousand and two choices for choosing a Democratic contingent and so we've simply multiply those together just like our restaurant choices and we end up with a very large number over six million different ways of electing the members of the subcommittee so now we're going to compute some probabilities using counting so a four digit PIN number is selected what is the probability that there are no repeated digits so that would mean that all the digits have to be different so if I was going to pick four digits where they're all the digits are different I would have ten choices for the first digit assuming we're allowing values 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 we have 10 choices for the first digit 9 for the second digit because we're not gonna allow repeats 8 for the third digit and 7 for the fourth digit or in other words that's 10 P 4 right is 5040 different pins pins with no repeats now in order to compute the probability we're gonna have to find the total number of of pin numbers including repeats so all pins so if we consider all pins that including allowing repeats how many choices are there for the first number 10 how many for the second number also 10 also 10 also 10 because we allow repeats so there's no exclusions so that's 10 to the 4th and 10 to the 4th is 10,000 so there's 10,000 total pins out of those five thousand and 40 of them have no repeats so we got 5,000 and 40 out of 10,000 or about 50.4% of pins have no repeated digits so now let's look at a lottery problem so in a certain States lottery we got 48 different numbers and six of them are drawn at random and if you have and you the player gets to choose six numbers and if there are six numbers match they win a million dollars in the order doesn't matter in this particular lotto so we're not playing Powerball and let's see if we let's see if we can find the probability that that will win we win that million dollar prize if we purchase a single ticket so the first thing we didn't know is how many possible outcomes are there so from 48 different numbers there we're going to choose six of them and order here does not matter which is why we're using combinations and so we end up with 12 million two hundred seventyone thousand five hundred and twelve different six number outcomes now if you have one ticket then you have one outcome and so your probability of winning is 1 out of 12 million 271 512 which is a really really small number and so that's the probability of winning the main prize now oftentimes there's a second prize and in this case it's a thousand dollars if you can match five of the numbers now there are still 48 choose 612 million two hundred seventyone thousand five hundred and twelve different outcomes but now we need to figure out how many of those involve us winning matching five of the numbers now in order for that to happen from our six numbers on the card we're going to have to match five of them so how many different ways can we pick five matching numbers out of our six that would be six choose 5 which is six now we also have to consider that you know how many different ways could we not pick the the last number so from the 42 non winning numbers we need to pick one of them to be on our card and so that is is 42 so our final probability of winning is going to be there are that many 42 times six is 252 different ways that we can match five numbers and not match the six out of our 48 choose six out of our 12 million two hundred 1512 total outcomes and that gives us a you know marginally higher probability of winning though it's still pretty small so now suppose we randomly draw five cards from a deck what's our probability of getting exactly one ace now in order for us to get exactly one ace then from the four aces in the deck we need to be able to we need to pick one of them one of them needs to be in our in our hand in our set of five cards and there are four different ways that that can happen and then from the remaining 48 non aces we're gonna need four of them because in order for us to have exactly one ace we need to have one ace and for non aces so this is one ace and then this is picking for non aces now remember we're doing counting here so we're figuring out how many ways how many ways can I pick four you know one ace out of four and how many ways can I pick four non ace is out of 48 and there are a fair number of ways of doing that so our final probability our probability of exactly one ace is 4 choose 1 times 48 choose 4 again that's the picking one ace and for non aces out of all the ways of picking 5 cards that's 52 cards I choose 5 of them all together that comes out to be about 770 8320 out of all 2.5 million hands and it turns out to be about 0.2 9 9 or in other words there's about a 30% chance that out of 5 cards one of them exactly one of them will be an ace so now what if we wanted to find the probability out of a 5 card hand of executive executive very similar to the last one here out of the four aces on the day in the deck we're gonna need to pick two of them and out of all the non aces in the deck we're gonna need to pick three of them this time right so we have a total of five cards two aces three non aces and that's out of all the ways that you can choose five cards out of 52 and that turns out to be about 0.03 99 so there's about a 4% chance that out of five fivecard hand that you'll have exactly two aces a pair of aces in that hand so now we're gonna look at sort of a notorious problem in probability called the birthday problem so suppose that three people are in a room what's the probability that there's at least one shared birthday among these three people so now this this idea of at least one is kind of tricky so the way we're going to tackle this is the idea that the probability of at least one is easiest to think about through its complement so what is the complement of at least one shared birthday well the opposite of at least one shared birthday is no shared birthdays and so that's the probability we're going to try to find so let's see in order for them to there to not be any shared birthdays then each person is going to have to have a different birthday so for the first person in our group how many different how many different ways could we pick their birthday well they would have 365 choices we're gonna ignore lis peers here out of the 365 choices for the fourth e for the year now the second person in order for them to have a different birthday then out of the 365 days in the year they're gonna have to have a different one so they only get 364 choices and then our third person in the room is only gonna get 363 choices and so this is the probability of no shared birthday the probability that each person has a different birthday and and this turns out to be you'll notice that this first fraction is actually equal to one so this turns out to be about 0.99 1/8 again that's the probability of no shared birthday so the probability of at least one shared birthday is 1 minus that is you know pretty small it's about you know 0.8% not too big let's make our group a little bit bigger now so suppose we've got five people in the room so then the probability of at least one shared birthday again will be one minus the probability of no shared birthdays in order for that to happen again the first person gets you know can pick any day they want they aren't of course actually picking but you know what I mean they that there's 365 four different ways that this person can have a birthday and not conflict with that person and we do this for each of our people in the room and that would give us our our answer turns out to be about at 2.7 percent but we could simplify this a lot if we notice that the denominator here is 365 to the to thee we see that this is just 365 p5 so through from 365 there's how many ways can we pick five or how many orderings are there and in the bottom we've got 365 multiplied together five times that's 365 to the fifth power and computing that we get exactly the same answer that we had there now this is really cool because now if we ask the question what happens if we put 30 people in the room what's the probability of at least one shared birthday we can answer this pretty easily because we can say well two one minus the probability of no shared birthdays no shared birthdays mean from 365 possible birthdays we're gonna put how many ways could we pick 30 different birthdays out of from 365 how many different ways could there be 30 birthdays including repeats right and that's the same idea as our numerator and denominator there and computing that that comes out to be 0.7 zero six or 70 point six percent which is probably a little bit surprising that means out of 30 people in a room there's a 70% chance that there's at least one shared birthday in that room so when the game roulette a wheel was 38 spaces 18 red 18 black and 2 green is spun in one of the possible bets of player bets $1 on a single number if that number is spot on the wheeled and they received 36 dollars our original dollar plus 35 additional otherwise they lose their dollar so on average how much money should a player expect to win or lose if they play this game repeatedly repeatedly so for winning let's first talk about the probability of winning if they bet on any one number their probability of winning the probability of winning is 1 out of 38 so then for losing the probability of losing is the complement of that so there are 37 ways that a player can lose now to compute this idea of expected value and we're talking here about sort of your expectations then we can compute that expected value by multiplying the probability of winning times the value of winning and adding to it or subtracting from it the probability of losing times the value of losing so for winning the value of winning is a positive $35 so we get $35 more than we started with if we win and the probability of that happening is 1 out of 38 we're going to add to that the the other outcome which is losing and that outcome has a value of negative $1 in other words when we lose $1 and that happens with probability 37 out of 38 if we add those together we end up with 35 over 38 minus 37 over 38 is negative 2 over 38 or in other words about negative 0.053 so in other words if you were to play this game you should expect on average to lose about five cents per spin so in other words if you were gonna if you played for hours and played for thousands of spins on average you should expect to lose about five cents per spin sometimes you win sometimes you lose but on average you'll lose about five cents per spin so now let's look at a lottery problem so we looked at this lottery before and we figured out that the probability of matching all six numbers was one out of the all the possible choices so it was one out of the ways of picking six numbers out of 48 which was 1 out of 12 million ish and the probability of matching 5 was let's see here we had two from six numbers we had to pick five and then from the 42 non winning numbers we had to pick one and we ended up with a probability of about 250 two out of again that 12 million there so now let's think about values so this thing has a value of positive 1 million dollars this had this outcome has a value of positive $1000 and then of course there's a probability of not matching anything which is going to happen the rest of the time right so 1 minus the 250 3 out of 12 million 270 1512 and this has a value of negative $1 because it costs $1 to play so to compute our probability here we're going to multiply we're going to multiply this probability times this outcome this probability times this outcome and this probability times this outcome and add those up and when we do we get a value of about negative zero point eight nine eight in other words if you play lotto a whole bunch you should expect on average to lose about ninety cents per ticket of course most people lose their dollar and only a few people are actually win anything but on average you should expect to lose ninety cents okay a 40 year old man in the US has about a 0.242 percent risk of dying during the next year an insurance company charges $275 for life insurance policy that pays $100,000 death benefit in other words it pays that if the person dies during the year otherwise they they you know just get their $275 and the person doesn't get anything so what is the expected value for the person who's buying the insurance so so so there's two possible outcomes here and so outcome number one of course is is is dying and outcome number two is not dying and each of those has an Associated probability the probability of of dying presumably is 0.002 for two and the probability of not dying then is the complement of that which is nine nine seven five eight right one minus the public bility of dying and then the value of the outcome well the value of dying and I know we're talking we're purely talking monetary values here of course not emotional values or life value purely monetary then for the person buying the insurance and their family the value of to them is the hundred thousand dollars they get the two hundred seventy five dollars they had to pay for the policy so they have a positive net benefit of ninety nine thousand seven hundred twenty five if they don't die then the financial value of the insurance is a negative two hundred and seventy five dollars so that our expected value then this expected value is the probability multiplied by the value of the outcome plus our other probability times the value of its outcome and altogether that gives us a negative value of 33 in other words if we had a bunch of people you know thousands of people who are you know for you ten thousands of 40 year old men then on average the men will have lost 33 dollars now it's not surprising that this value is negative that's the only way the insurance company can afford to offer policies I mean not 33 dollars on average is is what's paying for their expenses and you know profits and everything else that goes into a business for the agents and everything else and really the reason that they can afford to pay out that occasional hundred thousand dollar benefit is because of all the people who don't die who balance it out so you know even though this has a negative expected value to the purchaser there's certainly security you know knowing that your family's cared for benefits to having insurance which might make that expense worthwhile
