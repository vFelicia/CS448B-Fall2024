okay so we're moving on now to sequences and series this chapter is a little bit different in flavor from a lot of the stuff that you've seen previously for sequences it's still going to remind you a lot of kind of limits at infinity like you did way back in chapter one right it's going to be very similar to that once we get into series the closest thing that we've seen so far that's kind of comparable to what we're doing when we deal with series is probably improper integrals where we're not necessarily just trying to do a calculation get an answer out at the end um we're more interested in whether something actually makes sense so as a sequence is just going to be a list of numbers a series is going to be what you get if you add up all the numbers in a list and by list here we don't need a finite list we mean a list that goes on forever and of course if you are adding up infinitely many terms then there's a good possibility that they don't add up to anything right um they they make kind of you know the values might jump around and never settle down to a value they probably add up to some infinite value if they do add up and so it's it's interesting just to figure out when can we actually add these numbers up and get something sensible right um so we're more interested in almost like existence questions now rather than computational questions and so that gets uh that gets a little bit tricky sometimes right it's a different philosophy um than what you've been dealing with so far um but we start with sequences we can give a definition okay so there are a number of ways of defining a sequence but the kind of definition that most people tend to give is the following so a sequence and i guess we should say you know we could consider sequences of other numbers we could consider we could consider sequences of complex numbers we even consider sequences of functions matrices vectors there's lots of things that you can put into a sequence but right now we're just looking at sequences of real numbers okay so a sequence is just going to be a function f so i'm going to write it like this it's a function f from the natural numbers to the real numbers this is one way to write it um so what do i mean here okay so what exactly do we mean by this notation if you haven't seen it before well what i mean is it's a function whose domain so here n is the domain the domain of our function will be the natural numbers okay so big n here stands for the natural numbers and depending on who you ask sometimes the natural numbers include zero sometimes they don't um we'll we'll allow zero because sometimes this can we need to have a sequence start at zero so we're looking at zero one two three four and so on right um and so the idea is basically for every natural number right we can write those out in a list and for every natural number on the on the list we write down a corresponding real number right so what we're going to have is something like say a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 and so on right so we might we might write it something like that so in other words we could say that f of a natural number is a sub n so a n here is a real number okay so there's lots of things you can think of here i mean you can just write down any list of real numbers and that's going to give you a sequence um probably you want a sequence that follows some sort of pattern right so we might look for something like know we might have something like this our sequence might be something like 0 1 4 9 16 25 and so on and maybe by now you've guessed the pattern right so in other words we can say here that f of n is just n squared typically we don't really bother with function notation for sequences so more likely how you're going to see this written it would be simply as a n is n squared okay so any any function that you can think of you can write down like this and you can you can get a sequence here's one that's uh that's sort of an interesting one we could do this one a n is cosine of n times pi so what does that give me as a sequence well it gives me cosine of 0 cosine of pi cosine of 2 pi cosine of 3 pi and so on but we we know the value of cosine at multiples of pi cosine of 0 is 1 cosine of pi is 1 cosine of 2 pi is 1 again cosine of 3 pi is minus 1. so you get a sequence it just alternates back and forth 1 minus 1 1 minus 1. another way that you could write this and this is typically how you would express this would be to say well it's minus 1 to the n right now normally powers of negative numbers are kind of tricky things we don't normally like to put negatives into exponential functions you know we don't like to have a negative base for an exponential because square roots for example of negatives don't make sense in fact you know most real number exponents if you have a negative base don't make any sense because for a real number base right we really you know it's one thing to kind of keep in mind is to remember that you know when we define a to the x right normally we mean e to the x times the natural log of a so if a is negative this doesn't make any sense right um but we can make sense of integer powers of any number right because this just means multiply minus one n times so that works right it's n minus signs you're just counting how many minus signs you have and of course if you have an even number of minus signs you have plus one if you have an odd number of minus signs you have minus one so you can do things like that right sequences that you might have encountered in a high school course would be things like arithmetic and geometric sequences where you just add the same thing every time or you multiply by the same thing every time right so something like you know adding just counting by 2 0 2 four six eight or or maybe you start at one and you add five every time so you have one and five or sorry one six eleven sixteen so on something like that right these are arithmetic sequences multiplying by two like we can do you know 2 4 8 16 32 64 right geometric sequences we can make sense of those you can also look at what are called recursive sequences and we'll we'll encounter a few of these and this is something that you know is not a thing you can do with with functions of a real variable right so if the domain is real numbers this doesn't make any sense but if your domain is the natural number you can consider these socalled recursive definitions so you can look at something like maybe we need to define a sub 0 to be two and we say okay i'm gonna define a n to be let's say three times a n minus one plus one for each n bigger than or equal to 1. and then you can kind of work out what that's going to be right so you start off with a 0 is equal to 2 right a 1 will be three times a zero so three times two plus one so i get seven right a two is going to be three times a one seven plus 1 so i get 22 and so on i can keep going you know adding more and more terms into that sequence generating those terms uh famous one that you might have seen fibonacci sequence right so the fibonacci sequence actually starts with two initial terms a0 is 1 a one is one and a n is just the sum of the two previous ones n minus one n minus two for each n bigger than or equal to 2. and so you can play around and you can see what sort of terms you generate there you get 1 1 and then 1 plus 1 gives me 2. 1 plus 2 gives me 3. 2 plus 3 is 5. 3 plus 5 is 8. 13 21 34 and so on so this is a very famous sequence it's studied in a number of different scenarios there's even a quarterly journal devoted just to this sequence believe it or not so there's lots of interesting things you can do with sequences and there's a lot of stuff you can study with sequences and it's it's kind of a gateway into studying calculus more abstractly getting into analysis right the theoretical underpinnings of of calculus a lot of things can be understood in terms of sequences limits in particular can be understood in terms of sequences we're just getting our our toes wet here we're just getting started trying to understand how things work um we spend a little bit of time on sequences and then we're going to dive right into series okay so our first example just asks us to generate the first few terms in a number of sequences written here on the board all right this curly bracket notation is the notation that's used in the apex calculus books for four sequences so we're thinking of this if you like as a set i think is the idea behind the notation other textbooks will will put round brackets around the terms in a sequence other books will will do things you might find brackets around the a n you might find no brackets at all notation tends to vary somewhat on these um as long as we get our point across maybe it doesn't matter how we write it let's try to be consistent so with this first one we have an exponential on top 3 to the n on the bottom we have this factorial so let me just remind you in case you've forgotten the factorial you probably encountered it back when you were looking at tailored polynomials if you did study tailored polynomials along with linear approximations back in the chapter on derivative approximations you might not have encountered them yet depending on the order in which you see the material factorial is just the product of the first n integers so it means one times two times three and so on up to n all right or another way to define it is we can define it like this now one thing that's kind of odd we do actually define zero factorial oddly enough zero factorial is defined to be one there are a number of ways to understand why zero factorial should be one that we are not going to necessarily get into right now one of the reasons simple reason is it is going to make some formulas work out a lot better for us later on once we get to taylor polynomials and taylor series okay so zero factorial is one um one factorial is is also one and then n factorial we just do n multiplied by n minus one factorial for each n bigger than or equal to 1. all right so 1 factorial is 1 times 0 factorial still 1 2 factorial is 1 times 2 times 1 factorial so you get 2. 3 factorial is 3 times 2 factorial so it's 3 times 2 times 1 you get 6 and so on right so with that in mind we come over here and 4 terms i guess we did the question doesn't say whether we should start at zero or one maybe we'll start at zero and we'll do five terms just to play it safe so we'll do n is equal to zero one two three 4 okay a sub n will be what will be 3 to the 0 over 0 factorial anything to the 0 is 1 so 3 to the 0 is 1 0 factorial we just said that's one okay i wish maybe equals is not the best thing to put here okay there's a1 sorry a0 a1 will be 3 to the 1 over 1 factorial so you get 3 a2 will be 3 to the 2 over 2 factorial so that's 9 over 2 okay a 3 will be 3 cubed over 3 factorial okay so that's 3 times 3 times 3 is 27. sometimes it's convenient to write things out like this because you can simplify a little bit cancel those threes it's also 9 over 2 okay and then 3 to the 4th over 4 we have 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 four times three times two times one we can cancel a couple of them that's going to come out to be 27 over eight all right um so one of the things you can see here is that initially the exponential is bigger right 9 is bigger than 2 27 is bigger than a but each time we we kind of proceed to the next step we're multiplying on the top again by 3 but the number we're multiplying by on the bottom is getting bigger each time so the factorial is going to grow faster than an exponential right and we're used to thinking of the exponential as this very fast growing thing factorials grow even faster right so eventually the denominator is going to win here and we expect that these terms should get smaller and smaller and smaller if we let things go on long enough okay but there's the first four or five terms if you like one three nine over two nine over two 27 over eight okay we can come to the next one so a zero will be four plus minus one to the zero that's five right a one will be four plus minus one to the one so that's four minus one we get three a two well we're gonna be back to minus one squared even power again so we get four plus one so five and you can kind of see what's going to happen here right a3 will be three a4 will be five and this sequence is just going to jump back and forth between five and three so five three five three five three five three for however long you want to go all right let's come to this last one you might be worried about the the fraction here with the minus 1 that seems like trouble but it's ok because you know whatever number n is remember n has to be a natural number so it's either even or odd if n is odd well then n plus one will be even so one of these two is always even so we divide by two we still get a whole number we're fine we can do minus one to an integer power that makes sense so ah we better not start at zero for this one right we can't divide by zero so this one is definitely going to start at one so we'll do a1 a2 a3 a4 we do have to pay attention to these things sometimes so a1 is going to be minus 1 to the let's see it'll be 1 times 2 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 1 over 1 squared so we just get 1 uh minus 1. sorry a2 we're going to get let's see it'll be 2 times 3 divide by we get 3 right and so that's minus 1 to the 3. on the bottom we have 2 squared 4 minus 1 over 4. a3 we're going to have 3 times 4 divided by 2. so 3 times 4 divided by 2. 12 divided by 2 minus 1 to the 6. okay over three squared nine so one over nine and finally a4 if n is equal to four we're gonna have four times five divided by two so we have 20 divided by two that's ten ten over two yeah sorry ten right twenty over two is ten so minus one to the ten it's even again over 4 squared 16 so we get 1 1 over 16 for that one and again we could keep going um here probably the main challenge is it seems like maybe it's a little bit hard to predict whether this thing is going to come out to be an even or an odd number as n goes on right the bottom we understand that's easy to understand um whether we should have plus one or minus one in the numerator we'd have to think a little bit about that if we wanted to continue this sequence on any further all right so next step is something certainly more challenging than the previous one so in the previous one we were given a formula and we just had to generate the sequence now we're we're given the first few terms in a sequence and we have to come up with a formula that generates those terms now one thing that's tricky here is you can't necessarily guarantee that your formula is correct right it might be that there are many different sequences that begin in the same way in fact online there's a database of sequences and you can go in and you can put the first few terms in into that database and ask it okay which sequences match the terms that i'm starting so we could go in we could go online we could find that website we could enter these and see what it predicts and maybe it only comes up with one answer maybe it comes up with more than one but we'll we'll try to see if we can find one that makes sense here right so in the first one we're just looking for a pattern 2 5 8 11 14 we say okay what do we see about these numbers well looks to me like we're going up by 3 every time right 2 plus 3 is 5. 5 plus 3 is 8 8 plus a 3 is 11. 11 plus 3 is 14 right so we can look at the differences we see that we're going up by three a lot of the time what you want to do is you want to look at things like what's the difference between terms right if i subtract them do i see a pattern in the differences or maybe maybe if i divide do i see a pattern in the in the quotients um so you try to look for any pattern any way you can come up with it you try to look for a pattern and you once you've got something that you think works take a guess at the formula see if your formula generates those terms right so in this case we see that we start at 2 and we go up by 3 each time so our guess is going to be that a n should be 2 plus so each time we go up by n we add 3 so that should just look like 3n right for n bigger than or equal to 0. and we guess that and then we check all right so let's do 0 1 2. you can check that i still do the first couple you can do the last couple all right n equals 0 i get 2. n is equal to 1 2 plus 3 i get 5. and it's equal to 2 i get 2 plus 6 i get 8. looks good right try the next one if i put n equals 3 9 plus 2 is 11 n equals 4 12 plus 2 14 works okay um so maybe there would have been other formulas that generate those first five terms but we've got one that it does the job so that works for us right and of course one of the reasons why we might want to come up with a formula like this is we might want to start looking at what's the longterm behavior right what can we say about this pattern for large n does the sequence have a limit as n goes to infinity these are the problems that we want to study soon so if we have something like this well we we need to have a formula like that if we're going to look at things like limits right okay so we look at the next one so one of the things that we might notice here is we're alternating signs each time right plus minus plus minus plus minus and so one of the things that you might guess for your formula is that if you see the alternating signs well maybe there's a minus 1 to the n in there right that's something that alternates sign so if we put that in there to deal with the minus signs then we can focus on the numbers without necessarily looking at the minus sign so now we have 2 5 10 17 26 37 and we see if we can get a pattern there all right well not as simple as the last one but again maybe we look at differences five minus two is three ten minus five five right seventeen minus ten seven so we look at the differences and we notice the differences are three five seven again ignoring the minus signs 26 minus 17 9 37 minus 26 11 ah those are odd numbers okay so it looks like we're we're going up by an odd number every time right so we should add an odd number start at 2 and we add an odd number so what does that look like um so we're going to start at 2 and we add an odd number so an odd number looks like two n plus one right every even number is just a multiple of two adding one gets me to an odd number all right and make sure that that's going to work for us we might have to shift things a little bit so if n is equal to 0 we get 2 good right if n is equal to 1 we get a minus 1 here that's going to be three plus two we get five minus five yeah if n is equal to two that becomes plus one that's gonna be five plus two is seven ah doesn't that doesn't quite work does it um no no no because that's just getting the odd number so what we want to do is we want to take the previous number and add a new odd number in so that's not quite working is it so it's not as simple as that it's it's going to be more like hmm how are we going to do it let's see we got to take that we got to add the previous one so we're actually doing is doing something like this minus 1 to the n and then we're going to do we have that 2 at the beginning and then we're going to do is going to be 3 plus 5 plus up to 2 n plus 1 something like that well that's not a great formula is it um does it work not really um oh but there's something that we might also notice yes there's another thing we might notice okay each of these numbers it's one bigger than a square okay now i noticed that because i happen to remember that there's a well maybe we should have noticed that right away but there is a formula that you can prove that says if you add up the first n odd numbers 2n plus 1 what you get is simply n squared right start at 1 1 is 1 squared 1 plus 3 is 2 squared 1 plus 3 plus 5 gets you to 9 which is 3 squared 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 9 gets you to 16 4 squared all right now the way you actually establish that as truth is using a technique called mathematical induction you do a proof by induction which is not something that you're probably going to learn in your calculus course you're going to see that maybe in an introduction to proof's course or whatever your first sort of proofbased course is you're probably going to run into proof by induction so what we actually want here is to realize huh what we really should have is this should be minus 1 to the n and then we should do n squared plus one that's going to work right one squared plus one two squared plus one three squared plus one fourth squared plus one five squared plus one six squared plus one does the job all right so that was a little bit trickier all right um this didn't work that gave us the wrong answer right that's just generating the odd numbers but those odd numbers are the differences they're not the actual terms in the sequence so you say no that didn't work we go to this one but that's not a very useful formula so we find a nice closed form and now we're happy okay getting there next one now the next one i can spot just because i've been working with these numbers i know these numbers i know where they come from so i can write down the answer right away you might not be able to write down the answer right away but we can start thinking about them and say okay what's happening here 1 1 nothing's happening there then we go to 2 then 6 and 24. okay so what's the difference you know how do these numbers compare two is twice as big as one six is three times as big as two 24 is four times as big as two right so we're doing times one times two times three times 4 24 times 5 gets me to 120 120 times 6 gets me to 720 well i know what these ones are this is simply the sequence of factorials okay remember we we said that 0 factorial is 1 right 1 factorial 2 3 4 factorial 5 6 factorial it's just the factorial sequence okay not so bad one more to go the video is running a little long so let's dive right in and see if we can answer this last one we should have split this into two halves five over two five over two fifteen over eight it looks okay at first you can't really see a pattern here right um two two eight four oh it drops way down and then 32 what's going on there um well one of the reasons why you can't see a pattern here is that we've reduced the fractions right so reducing the fractions is kind of hiding what's actually going on here five over two is the reduced form of ten over four five over four is the reduced form of 20 over 16. okay so if we don't reduce those fractions the numerators are going 5 10 15 20 25 is multiples of 5. all right and the denominators are going 2 4 8 16 32 those are powers of 2. okay so on top 5 n on the bottom 2 to the n and n is starting at 1. all right let's confirm that it works if n is equal to 1 we get 5 over 2. if n is equal to 2 we get 10 over 4 which is 5 over 2 and is equal to 3 15 over 8 and is equal to 4 20 over 16 works right we got it all right so in this next video we want to introduce the idea of the limit of a sequence we're going to look at limits before we move on to examples we need to introduce some terminology okay so definition comes first okay so we say that a sequence a n and the term that we use here is converge okay just like for improper integral so we're going to say that the sequence converges to a limit l okay and we might just say the limit is l and so we write this as limit n going to infinity so we only look at limits at infinity for for sequences limit of a n is equal to l if all right we're going to give the precise definition if for any positive epsilon there exists a natural number n such that for all n bigger than or equal to that n difference between a n and l is less than epsilon okay all right so the definition is a bit of a mouthful okay so the key word here is converge right or limit if you like here's our standard notation okay limit of the sequence is l so we get into this epsilon delta formulation again right for epsilon greater than zero there exists an n such that for every little n that's bigger than this fixed end right so here i think this is the variable this is some number um we have this inequality um visually this sort of makes sense okay so what we're really saying here when we say we have a limit think about things graphically right we can we can plot the terms in a sequence because we can remember that we can think of a sequence as just a real valued or you know it's a real valued function where the domain is just the natural numbers right so we can mark our natural numbers down and we have some value say l so l is going to be the limit let's say all right so let me just draw that line in y is equal to l okay and epsilon here think of epsilon as like an error right what we're saying is that you know the difference between terms in the sequence and the limit will be small okay so what we're saying is there for any epsilon so we can choose a large epsilon but typically we think of that as a small epsilon so here's l plus epsilon here's l minus epsilon right so we get this little strip of with two epsilon centered on l and then you start plotting the terms in your sequence right and so maybe the first one is down here like here's a1 right and maybe a2 is up here and maybe a3 is down here and a4 maybe it's up there okay a5 is here a6 is there a7 lands inside oh great but then suddenly a8 is out again but then a 9 is inside a 10 it's inside 11 is inside 12 is inside right so there's there's some value of n right here right so that once we hit there all the later terms in the sukin sequence are going to be uh within that strip and of course this is saying that the terms in the sequence they do have to get closer and closer and closer to l because if i shrink the strip right if i make epsilon smaller if i make this narrower well then i might have to go further out before i find an end that works but we're saying if we say that we have a limit of l we're saying that no matter how thin i make this strip i can eventually go far enough out so that everything stays inside the strip right thinner strip bigger n but i can always do it right eventually i'll always get inside this trick so that's what it means to have a limit in this sense all right so in the last video we introduced the notion of convergence of a sequence right so this is just whether or not um the limit of a sequence exists and gives a finite value as n goes to infinity right so if you calculate the limit and the limit is either infinite or the limit doesn't exist then we would say the sequence diverges if so a convergence sequence is going to be one where we actually get a number for the limit so that's what we're looking for here okay now one of the things that is worth pointing out is that if your sequence um if your sequence is you know given by f of n where we know how to do this limit the limit as x goes to infinity so if we replace n with a real variable x and we calculate that limit and it exists well then the limit as n goes to infinity of a n will agree right now that doesn't always work because there will be situations where this limit doesn't exist but we can still make sense of the of the sequence because there might be functions that you know for a real variable they're jumping around all over the place but you put in only integer values and things settle down but this does give a handy tool especially for something like this because we know how to do a limit like this right we know that if we were doing the limit as n goes to infinity of three n squared minus two n plus one over over n squared minus a thousand right if we had x instead of n here then this is the problem that you did way back in the very first chapter on limits right very beginning of calc 1. we'd say okay it's quadratic top and bottom right if the degree is the same on top and bottom we look at the ratio of the coefficients three over one we know that limit is three so it converges it converges to three so that's that's simple enough right it's good enough to do that i mean you should say something right say why is it three well because it's the same degree top and bottom and that's a rule that we learn right um if you feel like that's too easy and you want to show a little bit of work well you could always do that same trick that we did with the real variable divide everything by n squared right so you could write this as the limit n going to infinity of 3 minus 2 over n plus 1 over n squared 1 minus 1 000 over n squared and you can use the limit definition you can give an epsilon n proof to show that the limit of anything any constant over n that limit is going to be zero same with n squared n cubed you know constant over any um positive power of n is going to go to zero so we get three over one in the limit we get 3. great you move on to something like this well this if you plot it it's an interesting thing because if you plot this function if you plus the sequence right i mean we know what it is a function of x so you get this cosine wave it oscillates back and forth um but if you start plotting the points for the sequence the textbook has the scatter plot shows you what it looks like well then it's a little bit different right because you're only plugging in the integer values so you're i mean you're getting points that are on that cosine wave right but only only at the integer values and and the cosine wave you know if we're just doing cos n it's not oscillating with an integer period right the period is a multiple of pi so things are going to actually jump around a whole lot it's going to be kind of funny looking but nonetheless we know for sure that this is not going to exist right so this limit diverges so this sequence diverges i mean we need to give a reason for it but one of the things we know is that well we know the limit as x goes to infinity of cos x that doesn't exist right because it oscillates back and forth between 1 and 1 right we hit those values in fairly many times now we're not actually going to hit minus 1 or 1 for this because we're not actually going to get to you know a multiple of pi over to multiple of pi right um we don't get to a multiple of pi um but we get close right um so somewhere along the way you know n's going to infinity we have all the integers in there so somewhere along the way we have we have you know three all right we have 31 314 right 3100 you know uh 41 we have 3 100 or 31 000 415 you know we we have these numbers which are very close to to multiples of pi right we can kind of add more digits of pi but before the decimal right so this is this is close to 100 pi thousand pi 10 000 pi right those are all even multiples of pi and then we could also consider you know odd multiples we can shift things a bit so we can get lots of values that are close to one we can also generate values that are close to minus one we can get all kinds of things in between right um so it's never going to get close to any value it's going to keep jumping back and forth forever so that's no good okay now you come to this last one and there are a couple of ways that you can tackle something like that one would be to to go to the to the definition or i mean you want to probably play around a little bit right and you say okay well the terms in the sequence are going to be i'm going to have like minus 1 then i'm going to have a half then minus a third plus a quarter minus a fifth plus plus 1 6 right and so if you start plotting them you can kind of see that yeah it looks like they're going to zero because you have well one way to think about it is that you have we draw in here's y is 1 over x down here we can put in y is minus 1 over x right and and so the the terms in the sequence are going to be you know i guess the first one would be down here and then up here and then here and then there and there and then there right so you can see that they're getting closer and closer to zero the trouble is we can't actually we can't write this as a function of x as it is minus one to the x makes no sense at least working with real numbers it makes no sense now one of the things you can do is something that we observed initially here is a function that actually agrees with this sequence on the integers cos pi x over x right because multiples of pi right integer multiples of pi when you plug them into cosine you get either one or minus one like we were just talking about so there's a function of x that agrees with our sequence so at every integer and if you take the limit of that well we we saw that again but go back to calc 1 methods squeeze theorem essentially is going to tell you right because the absolute value of this f of x right well absolute value of cosine is less than or equal to 1. so this is less than or equal to one over x in absolute value and so the function is sandwiched in between minus one over x on the one hand and plus one over x on the other hand we know that those both go to zero so this has to go to zero as well actually that squeeze theorem argument you can use that for for sequences as well that's perfectly valid right we can just say well look it's true that minus one over n is less than or equal to c n less than equal to one over n for all for all n and we know that that goes to zero we know that that goes to zero squeeze theorem says that this has to go to zero as well so we know that the limit as n goes to infinity of cn is zero so it converges and it converges to zero all right so here are a couple of theoretical results on limits that can come in handy the first one we we just actually employed towards the end of the the last problem the last example where we noted you know we had this remember what the problem was we were trying to do the following limit right we said okay we have this limit n goes to infinity of minus 1 to the n over n and we said well you know what we'd sure like to just sort of argue that since minus one to the n just goes back and forth between minus one and one it's bounded n is going to infinity so this is this is a number that's always either one or minus one dividing by larger and larger numbers that things are getting closer and closer to zero um we found a couple ways to kind of argue that yes that limit does indeed have to go to zero but here is is one theorem that kind of lets you do it quite quickly right if if a sequence goes to zero an absolute value then the sequence has to go to zero and it is exactly that same sort of squeeze theorem type argument that we gave towards the end of that solution we said okay well this just works because any any number is well it's either equal to its absolute value or the negative of its absolute value right so it's it's in between those two um and so if this goes to zero in the limit and that goes to zero in the limit well then this one in the middle has to go to zero as well right or if you like it's you could use the the definition right you could go back to that epsilon n definition and you say okay um well um we let epsilon be given and we can say that since since the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of n is 0 we can choose n such that the absolute value of the absolute value of a n minus zero is less than epsilon right um but then you know just think what this is well i mean minus zero that's just so it's the absolute value of the absolute value but that's just the absolute value of a n right which is the absolute value of a n minus zero right so that same n is going to work here because really the the absolute value of a n is the same as the absolute value of the absolute value of a n right so that just get it right away with really no effort limit properties work the same for sequences as they do for functions right um if you have two convergent sequences with finite limits right then the limit of the sum is going to be the sum of the limits if there's a constant you can pull it outside the limit right so you can think of this as this is just k times the limit of a n right a limit of a product is product of the limits limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits well as long as the limit of b n is not zero right so you can do all of these things um we won't necessarily go through the proofs in in a calculus class um again you might see them in another course uh maybe in an analysis course um probably just in a basic like introduced proofs course you're going to see something like that um the the proof for the limit of a sum is a is a standard one that you're probably going to encounter and it's a nice one to see um go through the details i don't know if we want to do it here we only have so much board space we don't want to make the video too long the let me i'll just kind of explain the idea of the proof for the limit of a of a sum right so for the limit of a sum right uh you're given so epsilon is given right and you're trying to make this difference smaller than epsilon right but i can rewrite this as a n minus l b n minus m just rearrange things okay and and if you redo and by the way if you're doing the difference you'd have a minus sign here instead of a plus sign and the next step actually is the same you have the triangle inequality the absolute value of a sum is always less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values all right so you can get something like that and so i'm not going to write up all the details of the proof obviously i don't have broom but essentially the way you would proceed is you say okay i'm given the epsilon now i got to choose my n and you say okay well look um i know that this limit exists right that limit is l right so a n converges to l so i know that from here i can choose i can choose some n1 that makes this absolute value less than epsilon i can choose an n 2 that makes this difference less than epsilon right because i know that those two sequences converge and then what i do is i choose i choose n to be whichever of those is bigger and one and two right so that means that if little n is is bigger than big n well then it's bigger than both of these and so i know that that difference is less than epsilon i know that that difference is less than epsilon oh except you know then that the sum is going to be 2 epsilon and that's not quite what we want so we say hey actually we can choose these so that this will be less than not just epsilon but that'll be less than epsilon over 2. and we choose so this is less than epsilon over 2. and so then when we add them together we get that epsilon right that's a that's a standard kind of argument that you use for doing epsilon delta proofs with sums or differences all right so in this example we're going to work with some of the limit properties for limits of sequences that we saw in the previous video we're given three sequences we're told their limits okay um some of these i mean we can work these out if we absolutely had to but they're they're given to us right um here you know if we wrote all of these as functions of x and we think about taking the limit as x goes to infinity we know how to handle this it's just a rational function degree is bigger on the bottom so yes the limit should be zero um this one here um this is interesting right that is like base e from like the natural exponential function right that's euler's number um some people will actually take this as the definition of e which is interesting but you can show that the limit is equal to e using um using l'hopital's rule right techniques for indeterminate forms because this is something of the form one to the infinity that's one of the forms that we know how to handle finally here this one's a little bit tricky if you try to take the limit well let's see n is going to infinity five over n is going to zero so it's like infinity times zero um oh but if we if we wrote this as sine five over n you know if we think of this as sine 5 over n divided by 1 over n oh now it's a 0 over 0 limit and in fact if we put a 5 here and a 5 here well now this is like a sine theta over theta limit right we know that limit as you know if n goes to infinity five over n goes to zero so we know that this this limit here is is one so five times one so that makes sense okay so we have these limits now we want to calculate these results over here and the point is once we know the value of the limits we don't need to get into the details we just need to apply limit properties so this one here well we know that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits so we can write limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus the limit as n goes to infinity of b n and the first limit is zero the second limit is e and so the result is going to be e right similarly here we have a product limit of a product is product of the limits as long as these two limits exist independently right we can have situations where where this limit does exist but these limits don't and then you got to be a bit more careful so we can do that okay and limit of b n is e limit of c n is five so e times five or maybe we would prefer to write that as five e okay and last one we have a constant multiple so if you have a constant multiple you can bring it outside the limit so this is one thousand times the limit as n goes to infinity of a n so it's one thousand times 0 which is 0. right so it's not so bad so the next thing that we're going to look at is what it means for a sequence to be bounded okay so here's the definition okay so we'll have a sequence let's say a n and we'll say that it's bounded if it's underline bounded so it's bounded if there are constants let's say little m and big m such that a n each term in the sequence a n is always between little m and big m so little m is your lower bound big m is your upper bound and of course we need that to hold for all natural numbers right it's for all n equal to 1 2 3 and so on we require every single term in the sequence to be between these two bounds okay so that's a relatively straightforward definition visually you can sort of think about how this looks right um if you plot the terms in your sequence you have some upper bound big m some lower bound little m and every term in the sequence has to lie in between those two bounds okay so we come over here to this example we've got a couple of sequences we want to decide whether or not these are bounded uh it becomes pretty clear once you start writing out terms in the sequence right so here we have one one half one third one over four and so on um so in particular they keep getting smaller right and i think it's pretty clear here that we have one over n less than or equal to 1 for all and bigger than or equal to 1. in fact if you just take reciprocal of both sides right if you if you have an inequality involving positive numbers and you take reciprocals the inequality reverses and done okay on the other hand if we come over to here you look at the sequences right two maybe we start at two to the zero so one two four 8 16. so on um these are not going to be bounded right there they grow without bound it's an exponential function we know in fact we know that the limit as n goes to infinity of 2 to the n is infinite so there can't possibly be an upper bound right these numbers grow without bound all right so in this video we're going to discuss a theorem related to bounded sequences the theorem says that every convergent sequence is bounded so in other words if the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is equal to l and l is some finite value right l is less than infinity then the sequence a n is bounded right that's what it says um now be careful uh this does not say that every bounded sequence is convergent it says every convergence sequence is bounded so you got to be careful those are two different statements one is true one is false this one is true and let me show you why um we'll actually prove this so let's suppose that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is equal to l okay um now let's think about the the definition of convergence right definition says for every epsilon i can choose a capital n so that for every little n bigger than that capital n the difference between a n and l will be less than epsilon so i can choose any epsilon because i know this limit exists so if i take epsilon equal to one there has to be some capital n such that the absolute value of a n minus l is less than one for all n bigger than or equal to big n now another way to rewrite this is to say well that means that this difference is between minus one and one and if i add l to everything that means that minus one plus l is less than a n is less than one plus l right or so a n is between l plus one and l minus one okay uh but only only for those values of n that are bigger than or equal to this capital n right what about the ones that came before well the ones that came before are a finite list right so basically what we do is we're going to let big m be the maximum of all the numbers a1 a2 a3 and so on down to a let's say n maybe you want to go n minus 1 if you want but it's fine let's leave it in and also we throw in l plus one and we can let little m be the minimum of a1 a2 a3 down to a n and then l minus one right and so essentially that's it you if if we take you know any term in the sequence any a n in the sequence um well then it has to be less than or equal to the biggest of these numbers if it's you know so if it's one of those terms it has to be less than or equal to one of these right whichever one of those is biggest and if we take an a n for little and bigger than this capital n well then we know that a n has to be smaller than l plus one right so whichever one of these numbers is biggest that's the upper bound similar whichever one of these numbers is smallest is is going to be the lower bound so we know that a n has to be in between for each value of n and that proves the theorem okay so every convergence sequence has a bound we've just demonstrated it but not every bounded sequence converges right um a good example of that is you just take take like the sequence minus one to the n it's bounded right it's always between minus one and one but it goes back and forth forever it never comes settles down to a limit so there are bounded sequences that don't converge we can add one more condition that does guarantee convergence and that's what we're going to talk about in the next video so the next thing that we want to talk about is monotone sequences so this is a definition has two parts so part one part 2. so a sequence a n is monotone increasing if a n is less than or equal to a n plus 1 for all natural numbers n and similarly it's decreasing if a n is bigger than or equal to a n plus 1 for all natural numbers n right so it's a very simple concept it aligns fairly well with you know what we understand for increasing decreasing functions although we do allow we don't insist on a strict inequality here we allow less than or equal when we're dealing with moderate with sequences so monotone increasing monotone decreasing right this condition here just says that the next term in the sequence has to be at least as big as the previous term right here the next term in the sequence is less than or equal so these ones are getting smaller these ones are getting bigger simple enough right so there's an important theorem related to monotone sequences bounded monotone sequences which says so and collectively we can say monotone if it's either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing and the theorem says the following the theorem says every bounded monotone sequence converges okay so that's what the theorem states so we mentioned before this previous theorem we proved that every convergence sequence has to be bounded and i warned that the converse is not true right every bounded sequence is not necessarily convergent but if we do have a bounded monotone sequence right the added condition of mono monotonicity guarantees that you can't have this sequence that's jumping back and forth right because it always has to be going up or always going down okay and so you're guaranteed convergence for every bounded monotone sequence um we're not going to prove this theorem because a proof requires actually getting into you know um careful sort of axiomatic definition of the real numbers you have to talk about least upper bounds least upper bound property of the real numbers but intuitively it's pretty clear why this has to work right so if we think about a bounded monotone increasing sequence right so if it's increasing and bounded above right if that's our upper bound and our sequence is increasing so maybe we start here we go up it's increasing it's increasing right but we can't pass n right so each term has to get bigger but we can't get any bigger than m all right we can't go back down because then we wouldn't be monotonous increasing we can't cross m because it's an upper bound right and so the idea here is is the way you would prove this is um one of the properties that the real numbers have is that any sequence that is bounded above has a least upper bound and so basically you would say well look here's uh here's a sequence of numbers it's bounded above we look for the least upper bound and you can prove that that loose upper bound has to be the limit right but then you've got to get into this discussion of least upper bound properties and of course for a sequence which is monotone decreasing and bounded below well it's going to do the same sort of thing right it's going to decrease down until we get closer and closer to that lower bound but we can't pass it so we approach whatever the greatest lower bound is and that's going to be the limit all right so here are four sequences we want to decide if these are monotone increasing monotone decreasing because we're interested in whether we can apply this theorem we've just discussed right we have a theorem says every bounded monotone sequence converges and so if we can identify when a sequence is bounded and monotone well then we have a very powerful tool for determining convergence of a sequence so let's look at these the first one is pretty straightforward and we might notice that n plus 1 over n can be written as 1 plus 1 over n and it's also pretty clear that the this is going to be decreasing right because as n gets bigger one over n gets smaller and so this is going to be going to be decreasing well maybe that's not a very water tight argument you know it's essentially appealing to the fact that these terms lie on the graph y is one over x we know that that's decreasing so we go with it right uh now there's a couple of ways that you could actually establish this right so one way you could establish this is we could say well you know if i let f of x equal 1 plus 1 over n or i guess it should be x now sorry all right so so our sequence is just the values of f of x when we when we restrict the domain to the to the natural numbers but we know that the derivative of this thing is minus one over x squared which is less than zero if x is bigger than 1 bigger than or equal to 1 and it's less than 0 for every x but in particular for x less than or equal to 1. and so that certainly establishes that this is a decreasing sequence the other the other way you can do it is you can consider the difference a n plus 1 minus a n okay if our sequence is decreasing then this term should be smaller than that term so this difference should be negative so we can try to show that that difference is negative you can go ahead and try it but we'll do it in the next one right it is done in the book if you want to look in the book you can go through how to how to do it that way we'll apply in the next one because we've got four examples to get through and we don't want this video to get too long okay so how about the next one we could once again kind of use this function argument here but we could just go ahead and do it right so this time there's not a nice simplification but we can say well what do we get if we do b n plus 1 minus bn okay what does that look like well we're going to have n plus 1 squared over n plus 2 subtract n squared over n plus one and we'd like to get a common denominator for that so we're going to get n plus one cubed minus n squared times n plus two over n plus one and plus two and well now we've got to multiply this all out n cubed plus three n squared plus three n plus one using binomial theorem minus n cubed minus two n squared over n plus n plus 2. and so we take a look at this and we say all right that cancels with that 2n squared that cancels with 2 of those 3 leaves you with 1. and okay so we have n squared plus 3n plus 1 n plus 1 n plus 2. that's positive okay because n is positive and so now we know that this particular sequence here is increasing right because the difference is positive good one decreasing one increasing we can go to the next one so the next one actually you know it's gonna bounce around on you initially you might find if you start plotting some of the values textbook does that for you right we can consider you know if n is equal to 0 what do we get right if we sort of start writing out the terms in the sequence when n is equal to 0 we have minus 9 over over 26 when n is equal to 1 we have minus 8 over what are we going to get 17 right n is equal to 2 we have minus 5 over 2 right n is equal to 0 we get 0 right and so on we can start plotting these and sort of play around and see where they go um and it's kind of hard to tell looking at those values to figure it out we can do this sort of difference method again the textbook does that for you it's it's a big mess though um you might want to sort of analyze the two polynomials in n that you see here see if you can get anything out of that you might want to for example well the top we can factor i don't know if that helps this at all but we can factor it the bottom let's see the bottom we could complete the square n minus five squared plus one well it's never zero that's good news you can play around with that you can you can do this difference but it's it's going to be it's going to be ugly um so maybe we do want to look at this one from the point of view of a function we say okay let's consider let's consider f of x to be x squared minus 9 for x squared minus 10 x plus 26. what's the derivative f prime is going to be 2x times x squared minus 10x plus 26. good little quotient rule okay subtract x squared minus 9 times 2x minus 10 whole thing over x squared minus 10x plus 26 all squared okay let me clean that up give myself a bit more room f prime of x so i've got 2 x cubed minus 20 x squared plus 52 x minus 2x cubed from here and then i've got uh minus 10x squared minus plus 10x squared um minus 18x plus becomes plus 18x um and then minus 90. well that's a mess but you know what it's it's actually okay it's not it's not as bad of a mess as you might think we look for cancellations again cancel there we can cancel there um this was 10 that adds up so we get and then that's going to be 70 right so we get on top now the bottom is never zero right we established that up here the numerator is always positive and we're squaring it yeah so i mean we just got to focus on the numerator um so that numerator we've got minus 10x squared plus 70x okay minus 90. okay so this is a quadratic and it's opening downwards right we can in fact we can pull out the minus 10. so we have x squared minus 7x plus 9. okay and it doesn't factor super nice but we can definitely tell that it's a quadratic it's opening downwards so these terms are initially increasing right they're initially increasing towards sort of that vertex in this quadratic on you know so there's a few values of of n at the beginning where we're on this side of the quadratic and things are increasing once we hit that maximum it's going to be decreasing right so we expect that this is an eventually decreasing sequence it's not decreasing from the beginning it's increasing a bit at the start but it's eventually going to start decreasing which is good enough okay we're getting a little long here there's one more still to go what can we say with this last one the factorial we can't really model with functions anymore we could try looking at the difference this might be one where it makes sense to just start writing out terms and initially initially it seems like it's increasing right so we have one for n equals one and then we're going to have four over two so we have two and then we have 9 over 6 oh that's already actually a little bit smaller right 16 16 over 24 right and then we have 25 over 120 and so on this is definitely decreasing right the factorial is going to grow much faster than the power function is so you have a decreasing sequence if you wanted to really kind of nail it down you could kind of look at this sort of difference again you could say okay what does the difference look like n plus 1 minus dn so you have n plus 1 squared over n plus 1 factorial minus n squared over n factorial actually if you remember that n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1 times n factorial right it's defined recursively then what you have here is just n plus 1 over n factorial minus n squared over n factorial okay and so it's minus n squared plus n plus 1 over over n factorial that is definitely going to be negative for large values of n right so once we pass here it's definitely negative we have a decreasing sequence all right so we're pretty much done with sequences now i'm ready to move on to series before we do i want to show you one more let's say slightly more challenging example this one has a sequence which is defined recursively right so we don't have a formula like most of the ones we've been dealing with so far we just have some formula that says a n is this function of n right and a lot of the time we can fall back on calculus techniques that we already have to understand what's going on but this one is defined recursively so we don't we don't have a function that we can work with so how do we find the limit of such a thing right i mean you can start thinking about like what do the what do the terms look like you know a1 is is root two a2 is root two plus root two a3 is root 2 plus root 2 plus root 2 and so on is that even going anywhere if so where right it's not at all clear how do we figure this out well we know that bounded monotone sequences converge okay so one of the things that we can do is we start plugging values in you know put them in the calculator you see what you get you get some numbers out right by the time you get to like a4 it's starting getting complicated enough that maybe you don't want to put it into the calculator anymore but you can try a few and if you try a few you find that you're getting numbers that are one point something you know they seem to be hovering a little bit below two so you might guess that two is an upper bound so that would be the first claim so we're going to claim that a n is less than or equal to 2 for all values of n well how do you show that how do you show that a n is going to be less than or equal to 2 for all values of n it's a little tricky right how do you deal with this recursively defined thing you could look at the difference you know 2 minus a n can we do anything with that let's see i mean 2 minus a n is what can i even say about a n um i don't know i can say it's like well i'm sorry 2 should go on the inside right you know put the square root of a n minus 1. um does that get me anywhere i want to show that this is positive right i want to show this is less than 2. so i want to show that that 2 minus a n is bigger than 0. not at all clear i could try rationalizing does rationalize get me anywhere um we are going to go somewhere don't worry all right we get 2 minus there and then we get you know 2 plus that square root on the bottom and okay you can simplify those cancel that's a plus um but you still feel like maybe you're stalled so how do you proceed well the right way to do this is you proceed using a technique called induction so we're going to proceed by induction okay so induction on and so the way this looks is we say okay so first of all we know that a1 is less than 2 right because a1 is square root of 2 we know that the square root of 2 is less than 2. okay 2. we're going to suppose suppose we know that some a k is less than or equal to 2. right actually we do we know when k is equal to one right and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna imagine well maybe maybe we also know this for some other values of k two three four we don't yet but suppose we did so the next step is we say well if we know that can we show that a k plus 1. is less than or equal to 2. this is this is how an induction argument works now we're going to do it before we do it let's point out why it works why does this work well essentially what you're showing here is you're showing this implication right you're showing that if this is less than or equal to 2 then the next one will be less than or equal to 2 so we have this implication going like that we know a1 is less than or equal to 2. so this is true when k is equal to 1. but if the hypothesis of a conditional is true so is the conclusion so we know that a one is less than or equal to two therefore a two is less than or equal to two but now we come back right a two is less than or equal to two therefore a3 is less than or equal to 2. since a3 is less than equal to 2 a4 is less than or equal to 2 and so on so we just kind of get into this this loop and we generate all the other possibilities so it remains to show that if a k is less than or equal to 2 then ak plus 1 should be less than or equal to 2. well why is that true if we assume a k is less than or equal to 2 well then we get that ak plus 1 is well by definition it's 2 plus square root of 2 plus ak right oh but we've assumed that ak is less than or equal to 2 so this must be less than or equal to the square root of 2 plus 2 right replace a k by something bigger but 2 plus 2 is 4 square root of 4 is 2. okay and that means that a n is less than equal to 2 for all natural numbers n using this technique of induction very good okay so now we want to show that so we've shown it's bounded now we want to show that it's monotone okay so i'm going to claim that a n is less than or equal to a n plus 1 for all and i want to show that it's increasing okay and so we could we could try something like this we could try playing around with differences and you know i think you can sort of get something to work doing it that way you can look at the difference you can put in the definition i mean let's let's check quickly and see what happens if i do the difference a n plus 1 minus a n well that's root 2 plus a n minus a n rationalize i get uh it's going to be 2 plus a n um oh well you know this isn't so great either right because if i rationalize i get 2 plus a n and i get minus a n squared over okay that doesn't seem ideal ok so we we scratch that so that doesn't seem to be working um let's try induction again can we do it by induction um if n is equal to one so we have chi we have a starting point right what's the base case so if n is equal to one is it true that a1 is less than or equal to a2 well let's see we know what a1 is a2 is the square root of two plus a one okay and let's see well we know that a1 is certainly bigger than zero right so this is bigger than simply root two and root two is a one okay got that um so now if we suppose assume that a k is less than or equal to a k plus 1 for some k well then what would be the next step so the next step if we just if we would assume this here right we increment by one right going from two to three we increment by one so we want to show the next time we be sure that a k plus 2 is bigger than or equal to a k plus 1. so we say okay a k plus 2 by definition it's 2 plus a k plus 1. oh but we've assumed that ak plus 1 is bigger than or equal to a k ah but root of two plus a k that's a k plus one done okay so using this technique of induction we can show that it's bounded above by two we can show that it's increasing okay so it's increasing it's bounded above it has to have a limit we have a theorem that says the limit is guaranteed okay so how do we find that limit now that we know it exists well here's a here's a sneaky trick we have this equality right let's take the limit of both sides limit as n goes to infinity for a n plus 1 should be equal to the limit well i get a little bit ahead of myself but let me let's do it i've already wrote the square root you can bring the limit inside the square root because square root function is continuous okay and the kicker here is that this limit okay that's l right l is the limit is equal to infinity of a n but i mean that's going to be the same limit here right because here you're just incrementing by 1 you get to the same place if n is going to infinity so is n plus 1. so l is equal to the square root of 2 plus l got to solve for l square both sides l squared is 2 plus l so l squared minus l minus 2 is 0. so let's see l minus two l plus one two possibilities for the limit well it's certainly not minus one because all of the terms are positive so looks like the limit should be 2. all right so we're going to move on now from sequences to series now in a sense a sequel a series is just a special type of sequence um it's a new sequence that's built from an old sequence um maybe more or more correctly a series is the limit of this new sequence um let me explain so start with some sequence okay so we have a sequence let's say a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and so on i'm going to write out the terms okay so as an example we could do the sequence one one half one quarter right so in general this is just a geometric sequence right with ratio one half one over powers of two and now what we're going to do is we're going to form the socalled partial sums okay so s1 is just a1 s2 the sum of the first two terms in the sequence okay s3 will be a1 plus a2 plus a3 s4 will be a1 plus a2 plus a3 plus a4 and so on right so in general we could say sn would be the sum k going from 1 to n of ak okay sum of the first n terms so this gives me a new sequence right this is is a sequence okay and if you have a sequence then it's reasonable to ask does it converge and well what what would be the limit of that sequence right what should it mean to say okay well what would it converge to what would be that limit if that limit exists what does it look like it's the limit n going to infinity of this s n well maybe we write that as the limit and going to infinity of this sum k going from 1 to n of a k and it's sort of notationally convenient to say well really what we mean then is something like this it's the sum k going from 1 to infinity of a sub k right we just keep adding the terms forever okay so this notation that you see here this is what we would call a series okay so a series is the sum of a sequence okay now for a lot of sequences that even sequences that converge a series is not necessarily going to converge right in particular we can see right away that um if the terms in the sequence are not shrinking and it's not shrinking fast enough right for example if if all the values in this sequence are staying close to some value like say two right then this is like two two plus two two plus two plus two two plus two plus two plus two right if you're if you keep adding more and more terms and those terms are always close to 2 well then this sum is going to explode on you right the sum gets bigger and bigger and bigger it doesn't have a limit so it may not converge right so when we're studying sequences we can use a lot of sort of calculus techniques we can play around we can often you know use analytic arguments to say oh yes this sequence converges and it converges to a particular limit here we just calculated it series is a very sort of different approach the flavor is much different the feeling is different because when you're dealing with series it's rare that you can actually say what a series converges to this happens to be one where we can so maybe it's a bad example but a lot of the time you're trying to show that a series converges you want to show that this sum right the limit of this sum is finite that you actually get a value out you may never be able to calculate it it might be that all you can do is say that the limit exists it has a value we don't know what it is but it exists right that can be frustrating for some people it's a change in process from a lot of what you've done the only thing you've seen so far that's similar to it is probably when you're doing like comparison tests for improper integrals so it's a bit of an adjustment but hopefully it's one that you're able to make coming back to this one here let's see what those partial sums look like why not s1 is one as two is one plus a half which is three halves that's three one plus a half plus a quarter um so let's see that is four quarters plus two quarters plus one quarter seven quarters right that's four one plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth one plus two plus four plus eight i get 15 over eight okay s5 one plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus one over 16. and if you add that all up you find that you get 31 over over 16. right you get 2 minus 1 2 minus a half 2 minus a quarter two minus an eighth two minus the sixteenth and and so on and so you might guess that this pattern continues of course you should actually show it and there are ways to show it and we'll do that later on but each of these partial sums these are called partial sums right is 2 minus a number and the number that we're subtracting gets smaller and smaller as we go through the partial sums which makes you think that hey maybe just maybe this adds up to something right and actually you can sort of see it visually right if you think about taking the number line from zero to two there's one in the middle and you start filling it up right um well the first and so you always fill half of what there is to fill right so in the first step we add one right in the second step we add a half in the third step we add a quarter that's half of what's left over in the fourth step we had an eighth then we had a sixteenth right so you get this sort of like xenos paradox style thing going on at each step you you know you cover half the distance that's the remaining right so you go half the distance remaining so there's always a little bit remaining because you only cover half the remaining distance right but each time you recover half the meaning every time you cover half the remaining distance you get a little bit closer and closer and closer to two until the distance that's left is so small um that you know it's less than let's say epsilon for example if you're thinking about doing epsilon and definition for a limit um and so indeed you can show that the limit actually converges converges to 2 and the sum k going from 1 to infinity actually we started at 0 right 1 is 1 over 2 to the 0 one over two to the k comes out to be two pretty cool all right so in the last video we we introduced the idea of a series as this limit of a sequence of partial sums for some preexisting sequence right so if that limit exists we say that the sequence convert or the series converges if it doesn't exist we say the series diverges so here are two series that we want to show diverge so how do we do it well um we can start thinking about what what are the partial sums look like right so in this case here we have s1 you can even start at 0 right s0 is 0 squared 0 s1 is 0 squared plus 1 squared which is 1 as 2 is 0 squared plus 1 squared plus 2 squared is 5 that's 3 0 squared 1 squared oops 2 squared 3 squared is 14 and so on and it certainly seems like those partial sums are going to keep growing and growing and growing well in general we know that s k is the sum you know let's say uh n going from 1 to k might as well start at 1 right starting at 0 we're adding 0 we don't gain anything from that n going from 1 to k of of n squared oh we've seen that before way back when we were doing like riemann sums right we saw this summation formula maybe we did it with i instead we get something like k k plus 1 2 k plus 1 over 6. and so certainly we can see from this that if we take the limit as k goes to infinity of of sk well that limit is going to be infinite right um this thing grows more or less as k cubed okay so certainly the limit uh doesn't exist so the series diverges all right how about this one here well let's start writing out you know what what is what does the sequence look like right so bn looks like well if n is equal to one this is minus one squared so one and it's gonna be minus one one minus one one minus one one right forever okay so from there well what does sn look like well we just do one and then one minus one we get to zero one minus one plus one one one minus one plus one minus one zero and i think by now you can probably guess the pattern we get something that looks like that okay so no fancy formula this time we just look at this and say well look we have a sequence which just alternates between zero and one we want the limit of that sequence well that limit certainly does not exist right the limit as n goes to infinity of s n does not exist so the series diverges so the next example we want to look at or a topic if you like is geometric series so the geometric series is a special type of series where we actually can understand pretty much everything there is to know about the geometric series it's also an important series because it comes up quite a bit when once we move on right later on we're going to look at power series taylor series right we're going to have so power series is sort of a natural extension you know from polynomials to things where you know we're still working in powers of x but we don't have a highest power of x right we just keep going on forever adding more and more terms in which case well you know you're going to have like an x to the n in there and you want to understand what's going on right you want you're going to be seeing series that look like that okay some people will put a constant in there like an a a times r to the n and call that a geometric series but you can always factor out the constant bring it out front even for an infinite series that works so we'll just concentrate on this and if we want to put a constant in we can always multiply by a constant all right so what can we say about a geometric series well one notice that notice that we start at zero not at one okay so if we were writing out the terms in the sequence that we're using here right the terms in the sequence are one r r squared r cubed and so on we add we add by r every time so we can think of those as maybe like the a n's and then the sn right the partial sums that we're adding up those are going to be 1 1 plus r 1 plus r plus r squared 1 plus r plus r squared plus r cubed and so on okay now uh what's cool is we can actually come up with a nice closed form formula for those partial sums okay so we have the following so if we look at sn so sn would be 1 plus r plus r squared okay up to r to the n right now i'm going to do this i'm going to do r times s n multiply everything by r so then i have r plus r squared and r cubed and so on up to r to the n and then n plus 1. now i've shifted it over one because what i want to do is i want to subtract these subtract so on this side if i subtract i'm going to have 1 minus r times sn right 1sn minus rsn gives me 1 over r if i factor out the sn and on the other side i have 1 r minus r r squared minus r squared rn right all of these terms cancel we're just left with that last one r to the n plus 1. okay so that means that my partial sums look like this 1 minus r to the n plus 1 divided by 1 minus r okay and notice that the dependence on n is entirely here in this exponent okay so now we ask ourself well what happens what happens if you take the limit as n goes to infinity of r r to the n or n plus one if you like okay well there are three possibilities um and i guess you know just to keep things uh let's keep things simple for now um no we'll just say let r be a real number um if the absolute value of r is less than one okay then this limit will be zero okay because if you take a number that's less than one an absolute value when you raise it to a higher power gets larger and larger and larger and you get zero in the limit okay it's equal to one if r is equal to 1. it's undefined if r is equal to 1 because it's just going to flop back and forth between 1 minus 1. and it's going to be infinite if the absolute value of r is bigger than 1. okay all right so these these are not too hard to work out you can convince yourself that these are true and so then we look at this and we say okay well what can we say then about this sequence of partial sums well um minus one we actually saw that in the last video right we saw an example minus one to the n that series diverges right we don't get anything there so that one diverges uh one to the n also diverges right because the one i guess case that we left out here is this is all well and good if r is not equal to one right but if r is equal to 1 then sn is just n right because you're just going to be doing 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 right so you get n and limit of n is n goes to infinity is certainly infinite okay and so we look at this and we say well you know what the the only time where you can actually take a limit of this is going to be if absolute value of r is less than one so what we can say is that this geometric series n going from zero to infinity r to the n it converges if the absolute value of r is less than one and in that case we get an answer 1 over 1 minus r for that sum right because this part is going to go to zero okay and it diverges otherwise so this is an interesting example because not only can we say exactly when it converges we can say what it converges to that's not always going to be the case all right here are three quick examples three quarters to the n minus one to the n over two to the n three to the n we wanna identify these as geometric series decide if they converge if they do converge figure out what the value is okay so in this case here it fits fits the pattern right we say okay what is the value of r r is three quarters and three quarters is definitely less than one an absolute value so we know that it converges and we know what it converges to all right the sum and going from zero to infinity maybe i'll point that out it converges and so let's figure that out so 3 over 4 to the n okay it's going to converge to 1 over 1 minus r r is 3 quarters so one over a quarter if we simplify we get four okay moving on to the next one well one of the things that you need to realize here is that i can always rewrite that as minus 1 half to the n right same as this one here we could have equally well being given this one as 3 to the n divided by 4 to the n so you got to be able to you know do those basic laws of exponents manipulations to get things into the right form all right it's in the right form so what's r r is minus onehalf and we know that the absolute value of minus onehalf is onehalf which is less than one so again we have a convergent series and what is the sum n going from zero to infinity of minus one half to the n it's going to be one over one minus minus one half okay so one plus half so one over three halves take the reciprocal we get two thirds okay this last one here well r is equal to three that's bigger than one so that diverges so the next type of series we want to look at is a p series okay so the basic form of a p series looks like this it's just one over some power of n right p is the power here p and p series is the power of n that we see in the denominator we can consider a basic p series where we simply have a power of n we might see something more general like this where we have some coefficients in there the only thing you've got to be careful about here is the starting point i've written n equals 1 but we'd have to check to make sure you know so a a and b here i mean they they could be any real numbers but we'd have to check to see when when does a n plus b when is that equal to zero right we want to watch out for that make sure it's not equal to zero if there is a zero for this at a positive value for n right if there's a if there's an integer value of n that gives me a zero i better start my series after that or it's not going to be defined right so we won't even get to talk about convergence because there's going to be one term in the series that blows up all right so the main result about p series is the following theorem which states that a p p series converges if p is strictly greater than one and it diverges otherwise so it diverges for p less than or equal to one okay so that's simple enough now this pseries test tells us whether or not the series converges it doesn't say anything about what that series converges to right so this is strictly a test for convergence we are not trying to calculate a value for the series should remind you a little bit about the pseries test for improper integrals and in fact that's where we get this from we'll see in the next section that we can use the result that we have for improper integrals to establish this result for p series so the proof of this result is going to have to wait but in the meantime we can put it to use here are several series we can see do they converge or diverge this one here this is actually an important result this is the socalled harmonic series okay and in this case p is equal to one but it's not bigger than one so this diverges okay so the harmonic series is a is sort of a famous counter example right um the first thing that you might kind of think when you start working with series you know you're adding infinitely many terms so you might think that as long as the terms go to zero you should be able to add them all up but the harmonic series is is this classic example that shows it's not enough to have the terms in your series go to zero that's not enough for you to have a sum you actually need those terms to go to zero fast enough or the thing is not going to converge right and so we can think of this as a consequence of the p series test that this series diverges although there are other ways that you can do this you can prove divergence sort of directly the the classic way that you do this is you say okay well my my sequence looks like one plus a half plus a third plus a quarter plus a fifth and so on and you start sort of grouping things together and you say okay well you know these two terms they add up to something that's that's bigger than a half and then actually if i added the next sort of three terms a fifth plus a sixth plus a plus a seventh those are going to add up to something that's bigger than a half and so on i think this is the this is the strategy that we use and and so by sort of grouping things appropriately we can say well the whole thing is is bigger than one you know plus a half plus a half plus a half and that's going to go to infinity if you keep adding one half forever interesting this next one well this is p series with p equal to two so this converges right here p is equal to two so this one converges this one is another famous series because we actually can say what the sum is and the sum is sort of surprising hope i remember this correctly the result is something like pi squared over 6 and you might be surprised to see pi making an appearance there and there are a number of ways that you can derive this result different areas of mathematics it pops up you can show it using surprisingly enough complex numbers complex analysis there's one way to show it there's other ways coming from differential equations there's also it's a strange result it pops up in a number of places there there are three or four very different proofs of the result the original result i think goes all the way back to euler and so that's interesting maybe more interesting as far as i know if we go to 1 over n cubed nobody actually knows what that adds up to we know it converges right it's p series with p equal to three p is bigger than one it converges nobody knows what it converges to odd how about this one uh okay this is well root n is one half so it is a p series but p is equal to one half and one half is smaller than one right two is bigger than one we should have pointed that out um and so that means that this one diverges okay this one here is not a p series we actually can't comment on the convergence of this one yet when you have this minus 1 to the n this alternating sign right so the the terms in this series are going to alternate between positive negative positive negative positive negative as you add them up those series have a special name they're called alternating series and there are special techniques for dealing with them it turns out that this alternating series does actually converge so adding that alternating sign is enough to take this divergent harmonic series and give you a convergent alternating series it does converge um and actually interestingly enough we know what this converges to as well converges to the natural log of two that's weird right actually we're going to see once we get to talking about taylor series we'll see where that comes from okay so it's not a p series but we'll see later on how to show that one converges this one here well this is a p series right it's a sort of this general form of the p series with p equal to three which is bigger than one and so that means that this one converges um notice the starting value 11 right we can't we can't do 10 because we get a zero in the denominator so we got to make sure that we watch out for things like zeros in the denominators start the sum a little bit later on once you're past all the zeros and then you can talk about convergence last one well the last one is not a p series the last one is geometric series fortunately we've already done that right this is geometric it's not a p series but it's geometric with r equal to one half and of course one half is less than one in absolute value so we know that this converges and actually we we know what it converges to we saw this in the introduction video converges to two so the next few examples we're going to look at deal with what are called telescoping series so a telescoping series is one where as we write out the partial sums we find that there's a lot of cancellation so there's a lot of cancellation within the sums and that allows us to evaluate the the series right now this one here we can actually we could show that this converges using essentially p series um or comparison we haven't established comparison tests yet but if you really wanted to you could do something like this right you could write this as the sum n equals sorry 1 get it over common denominator and minus n plus 1 then we subtract n we just have 1 over n times n plus 1 right and so that's roughly 1 over n squared p series p equals 2 bigger than 1 converges so we're pretty sure it converges but we don't necessarily know what it converges to so here's here's where we can kind of play around with this and we say okay well let's start looking at the partial sums s1 one minus a half okay s2 we get 1 minus a half right there's the n equals 1 term now we add the n equals 2 term one half minus the third s3 we have one minus a half plus a half minus the third and now we go for the n equals three term third minus a quarter and maybe now you can sort of see what's going on right we can we could regroup this as one minus a half plus a half so half minus half in there all right minus a third so one minus a third right here we can regroup this as one half minus a half all right and then third minus a third all right and then minus a quarter so we get one minus a quarter right and you can probably guess what's going to happen for the next one right so in general if we went down to sn we would have one minus a half and then plus a half minus a third and then plus the third minus a quarter and so on down to you know well so the very last term will be one over n minus one over n plus one and of course just before that there would have been a minus 1 over n n minus 1 so on and so basically everything cancels right there's a quarter there that will cancel with that those will cancel those will cancel and you just get one minus one over n plus one all right well now we know what the uh we know what we get because we we know that a series is just equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums right so it's the limit and going to infinity of 1 over 1 minus 1 over n plus 1. that's going to go to 0 so we get a limit of 1. okay here are two more examples start with this one now this certainly doesn't look like a telescoping series but remember the previous one i pointed out you know they've given to us as one over n subtract one over n plus one i think it was that if you put it over a common denominator then you get something that looks like this right we said hey you can sort of do like a p series sort of thing on it if you wanted to um but of course you may also need to reverse that process so we might have to say okay let's work over on the side and say okay we've got 2 over n times n plus 2 right rational function we can do partial fractions a over n b over n plus 2. right so how do we solve for these remember if we multiply everything by n we have a isolated put in n is equal to zero this disappears it's gone from there putting n equal to zero because two over two so a is one if i multiply everything by n plus two this will disappear when we plug in 2 that'll just be b this is gone put in minus 2 2 over minus 2 b is minus 1. okay so we can rewrite this as the sum and going from one to infinity of sorry something fell off the light still working let's keep going 1 over n plus 2. all right start writing out the partial sum see if we can figure out what's going on okay so we have you know let's just write it kind of a general one what it's going to look like s n okay so n equals one i have one minus a third then let's go to two one half minus a quarter oh it doesn't look promising does it oh but let's go to three a third minus a fifth let's go to four a quarter minus a sixth and so on so we actually do get some cancellation we eventually get some cancellation right uh the onethird cancels with the onethird onequarter will cancel with one quarter right that onefifth is going to cancel with the 1 over 5 and the next one the 1 over 6 is going to cancel with something in the next one but the one half the one half survives so we get one plus a half you know and pretty much everything else is going to cancel down to well we're going to have a couple terms left over right and that was going to be that's from n equals four yeah so we have one over n plus one so simplifies down to there okay and if n goes to infinity well these are going to go to zero and those stick around right so if we take the limit as n goes to infinity we're just left with one plus a half so we get three over two for the limit okay come to this last one well that definitely doesn't look like a harmonic or sorry a telescoping series but maybe we can do something weight can we do something with it ah yes log properties right we know that log of n plus one over n okay is the same thing as log n plus one minus log n okay so that means if we start writing out the partial sums right s n right is going to be well first of all log 2 minus log 1 which is just 0 right plus log 3 minus log 2 right then it's going to be log of 4 minus log of 3 and then log of 5 minus log of 4 and so on down to log of n plus 1 minus log of n okay so now we look for cancellations right log 3 cancels with log 3 log 2 cancels with log 2 log 4 is going to cancel with log 4 right the next term would be log 6 minus log 5. log 5's cancel actually everything cancels except for except for that so the nth partial sum is the natural log of n plus 1. okay but if we let n go to infinity on that we don't get a value right it's infinite so this diverges it diverges if you like you might add it diverges to infinity but the main point is it diverges all right we have three series here on the board that we want to try to evaluate um the strategy for all of these is going to be to work with some basic properties for series and a few known results some of which i've mentioned previously some of which are summarized in the textbook we'll we'll point them out as we go so a couple of the properties that we are going to rely on here are going to be things like if you have the series of a sum you can write that as a sum of a series so some of the ans some of the bn's and if you have a common constant multiple say c times a n inside the series you can factor it out okay and the reason you can do that is that well for each of the partial sums right for a partial sum it's just a constant multiple you can factor it out and then the series of course is the limit of that sequence of partial sums and we know that for limits if you have a constant multiple inside the limit you can bring it out similar arguments will work here right um we know that for finite sums this is valid we also know that the limit of a sum is some of the limits and so we can we can make that argument to get those things to work okay so let's come to something like this n going from 1 to infinity we've got minus 1 to the n n squared minus n over n cubed how are we going to deal with it well let's try manipulating a little bit first so n going from 1 to infinity let's leave that minus 1 to the n plus 1 out front and notice that we can divide each of these individually by n right so n squared over n cubed is just 1 over n n over n cubed is 1 over n squared okay so we can split it up like that so then we can write this if we multiply that through and we split this up into two series we can write it like this minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n subtract sum and going from 1 to infinity minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n squared okay now each of these turn out to be known results and these are not things that you're supposed to know how to come up with or establish at this point they're just results that somebody somewhere in the past has proved they're given to us in the textbook as a list of known values and so we're just going to use them this first one here is the natural log of 2. i think i've got that right the minus sign might be off by minus 1 but no i think that's right and this one here it turns out that this one is pi squared over 12. why i don't know there's some fairly sophisticated mathematics that probably goes into establishing that well beyond what we're doing in this course but there you have it right you can get that answer how about something like this well we can use the constant multiple rule and we can write it as 1000 times the sum and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n factorial now one of the known results that's given to us in the book says that if this sum started at 0 the sum going from 0 to infinity of 1 over n factorial is actually equal to e to euler's number so the sum is starting at the wrong point but that's okay we can we can modify that we can say all right if i started the sum at zero um well what does the n equals zero term look like the n equals zero term is just one over one factor or 1 over 0 factorial which is just 1 right so by starting the sum 1 earlier i've added 1. so i can subtract 1 to balance okay and then i know that this is e and that's well minus 1. okay so we can get that answer again we will actually see later on why this is equal to e once we've done power series taylor series we'll see why that's equal to e but we're not there yet all right this last one well what do we have we have 1 over 4 squared plus 1 over 5 squared plus 1 over 6 squared 1 over 7 squared so we've got the sum n going from 4 to infinity of 1 over n squared okay well that is the same thing as the sum and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n squared if we subtract off the n equals 1 term the n equals 2 term and the n equals 3 terms sorry 3 squared is 9. right oops there i'll get it right eventually okay um and this one over n squared that's that result we've mentioned already this is pi squared over six and this here i mean i guess if we want to get the common denominator 36 do we really want to do it uh why not 36 minus 9 well let's add them 36 plus sign 45 plus 4 39 sorry 49 49 over 36 for our answer all right so in the previous videos we introduced the notion of a series an infinite series as the sum of the terms in a sequence we talked about convergence and divergence we gave a couple of examples of series where we can actually compute the sum so we talked about geometric series we started with telescoping series and we saw how to decide whether or not those converge or diverge we also introduced the ptest for convergence of a series although at the time we didn't really have a justification for it now we start getting into some of the tests for convergence that will let us decide whether or not a series converges or diverges right now these tests are not going to help us find the value for a series if it does converge they're simply going to answer this question yes or no does it converge the first one is the integral test so here's the statement of the integral test so we start with a function it does have two requirements and if you are going to apply the integral test it's important that you confirm that these requirements are verified the function has to be positive it has to be decreasing the one place where there's maybe a little bit of flexibility here is you could always replace this number one by some other value maybe replace that by some integer k maybe you want to start at zero maybe maybe you have a function that isn't decreasing everywhere but you know for x bigger than or equal to 10 it is decreasing well then maybe you want to start at k is equal to 10 right and then of course if you make that change you would make the corresponding change down here and here okay so we do this standard thing where we talked about it those sequences we can always define a sequence if we have any function that's defined for at least all positive real numbers we can restrict the domain to the natural numbers and that gives us a sequence so the integral test says the convergence of the series where we sum the terms in this sequence convergence to that series is equivalent to convergence of the corresponding integral right so the if and only if is saying well if this converges so does this if this converges so does this or if you want to put it another way if this diverges so does this right so we look at this integral if it converges we know that this one converges if it diverges we know this one diverges and the idea here is we already have some practice with improper integrals and figuring out whether or not improper integrals converge or diverge and so anything that we learned about improper integrals and convergence of improper integrals can now be applied to convergence of series as long as we can put our series in this form for the appropriate type of function now if you want to see why this works it's actually pretty simple all right let's draw some coordinate axes let's draw a function which is positive and decreasing something like that okay and of course it needs to decrease to zero i mean it's not in the statement of the theorem but we know that if it doesn't decrease to zero we know that this is not going to converge and we know that that's not going to converge so better decrease the zero right and now we can mark off all the integer points one two three 4 6 7 8 9 and so on all right and we can think about area under the curve and we can think in terms of riemann sums all right so we're going to do you know so we can think about doing now i mean we really shouldn't talk about riemann sums we're talking about improper integrals because riemann sums need a closed interval to work with but um we can just go with sort of a fixed you know delta x equals one so we look at intervals of length one all right and if we do say left endpoints remember that when we do a riemann sum we can choose where on each interval we want to pick our point so if we do delta x equals one left endpoints well then we get something that looks like this all right okay and so on and so one of the things that you can see right away is that well what are these values right this is the point 1 f of 1 right this is the point 2 f of 2 and so on um the sum that we get right we get the sum and going from one and i guess we can continue all the way to infinity of f of n but f of n is just a n right times delta x but delta x is just one so we get the series actually right and what this is saying is that that series well that must be bigger then the corresponding integral right okay because we can see that we have a little bit extra in each rectangle so if we knew that this integral diverges if we know this integral diverges well and certainly the series has to diverge as well right because this is infinite so is that because it's bigger right um but you know you could equivalently decide that you're going to do maybe delta x equals 1 but you want to do right endpoints right so then we would get the underestimate right we use right endpoints we get that okay and so if we use right endpoints well then again this would be kind of f of 2 we're using f of 3 for the second rectangle f of 4 for the third and so on so we actually get we still get the sum of a n but actually n starts at two okay and starts at two and that amount is going to be less than the integral okay all right now that's not quite our series but if the sum starting at 2 converges well then certainly the entire sum converges because we can always just add right we can just do this we can say okay that's fine just add a 1 to both sides now you have the series right this is n equals 1 to infinity of a n and of course if this integral converges adding a number to it is not going to change the convergence of the integral um so if this converges this value is finite this is less so we expect that it should converge as well right um and yes i mean i'll i guess all this really you know if we don't put any conditions on the function this just tells us that well this number is not going to become infinite maybe that doesn't mean that the series is going to converge because you know what if what if the values bounce around a bit right well that's where you know the function we're saying the function has to be function has to be positive right so we're always so that means that all the a n's are positive so we can't have some series that oscillates back and forth because if we're jumping back and forth we'd have to be adding negative values we're not allowing that right and we need the decreasing condition as well again just to make sure that everything fits together the way it should but that's the integral test right so the way you apply the integral test is somebody hands you a series says does this converge well you look at the terms in this series and you say okay can i identify those terms with the values of some function if i can does the function have these properties or does it at least eventually have those properties if it does then you look at the corresponding improper integral um hopefully it's one that you know how to evaluate or at least decide on the convergence of and if you can decide whether or not the improper integral converges or diverges well then you can apply the theorem and you know whether or not your series converges or diverges all right so here's our first example where we're going to apply the integral test to determine the convergence or i guess well determine the convergence of m yeah so we mean decide if it converges or diverges right so we under determine the conversions of this series does it converge does it diverge all right so we make some identifications we say all right the terms are natural log of n over n squared that's what a n looks like and we can write that as f of n where our function f of x is the natural log of x divided by x squared so we got to check our conditions right um is it positive it's positive as long as the natural log is positive and that's true as long as x is bigger than 1 right log of 1 is zero so the first term in this in this series is actually zero so really we should say that uh n starts at two right we can at we can put n equals one in there with the n equals one term is zero we're adding zero it doesn't change anything is it decreasing how do we check if it's decreasing well we could appeal to the definition and say okay i want to show that if x2 is bigger than x1 then f of x2 should be smaller than f of x1 right um there are like sort of these like difference tests or ratio tests that you can apply to the sequence to see but it's a function of x it's a differentiable function of x we know how to decide if a differentiable function of x is decreasing we look at the derivative right let's look at the derivative f prime of x is going to be well let's do quotient rule derivative of the top 1 over x times x squared minus derivative of the bottom times the top divided by the bottom squared x to the 4. so this is going to be x times 1 minus 2 log x over x to the 4. okay um we need this to be negative when is this going to be negative it's going to be less than zero well it's going to be less than zero let's see well x can't be less than zero right it's a natural log x negative numbers aren't in the domain so it's going to be less than zero if one minus half log x is less than zero sorry one minus two log x is less than zero um and that's if let's see that's if the natural log of x is bigger than a half and that's going to be true if x is bigger than or equal to 2. natural log of 2 is like 0.6 something i think um okay so we're good to start at 2 right remember we we don't necessarily have to start at 1 in the statement of the theorem we can start at some k if we want to all right so we know that the theorem applies so now we look at the integral okay let's do that in green just so it stands apart from that we need to look at the integral from 2 to infinity we could do 1 if you want natural log of x over x squared times dx okay got to integrate by parts for this one let's kind of do that over and let's do the the indefinite integral over on the side just to remind ourselves how that goes so if we have a natural log that's always our u right so u is log x du is one over x dv one over x squared dx so v is minus one over x okay so we get minus log x over x plus the integral of v d u right so plus the integral plus because of the minus sign there plus integral of minus of one over x squared okay so we get minus log x over x minus one over x and i mean plus your c if you want to put the c in there okay so that means that this integral will be it'll be the limit as so let's say n goes to infinity of minus log n over n minus 1 over n okay that's the upper limit plug in the lower limit two log two over two okay plus one half and we just check now that this limit here is zero certainly that goes to zero uh one application of l'hopital's rule tells you that that one goes to zero right because derivative of the top gives you the one over n over the bottom gives you one and so we know that that limit is just zero so we get this finite value for the integral right integral converges and so we can state our conclusion we can say since the integral log x over x x squared it was sorry since that converges so does the sum and going from 1 or 2 if you want 2 to infinity of log n over n squared okay by the integral test all right so next we're going to prove a result that was promised in the previous section and we're going to prove the ptest we'll do it in general of course you can set a equal to 1 be equal to 0 and get the regular ptest but we'll we'll do the general version because of course that if we prove it in general it's going to apply the to the special case as well one thing that we should probably require though i think just well certainly i think we should specify that a is positive if a is equal to zero then this is just these are just constants and then we're adding up a constant and it's going to diverge right so we need a to be positive um if a was negative well you could factor the minus sign out you get a minus one to the p it's either plus or minus right it's constant multiple we don't worry about that and also just to simplify things for us let's assume that b is bigger than or equal to zero okay we'll assume that as well because if b is if b is negative then then we introduce the possibility that there might be a zero in the denominator for some value of n um and even even if that zero in the denominator doesn't occur at an integer even if it occurs at some rational value or i mean these could be real numbers or it could be some real number value it would still be the case that there's a vertical asymptote somewhere right um and if that vertical asymptote occurs somewhere between like let's say it occurs between n equals five and n equals six or something like that um well we won't have a positive decreasing function until we cross the vertical asymptote so we can handle that we just modify things right a finite number of terms doesn't affect convergence we can always start at some other value but just to keep life simple assume that b is bigger than equal to zero um so we don't have to worry about an asymptote okay at least we don't have to worry about an asymptote that happens for positive values of n right okay very good so with that in place basic graph transformations should tell you what this thing looks like right the graph of um let's see so what are we going to do well first of all our a n a sub n looks like 1 over a n sorry a times n plus b to the power of p right and so that is equal to f of n for a function f of x given by 1 over a x plus b to the p okay and that's just some transformed version of 1 over x to the p and 1 over x to the p assuming that p is positive here right typically it's going to look like that right this half will either be here or there depending on whether p is auto or even get something that looks like that so we we get the positive decreasing function that we're supposed to have so we look at the integral we say okay what do we get let's do the indefinite integral first so 1 over a x plus b to the power p integrate with respect to x okay now we know that if if p is equal to one well then we get this is going to give me 1 over a times the natural log of ax plus b and we know that as x goes to infinity that's going to blow up on us okay so we know it diverges if p is equal to 1. so we're going to assume here assume that p is not equal to one well if p is not equal to one then this is just power rule right power rule and chain rule so that is so this is the integral of ax plus b to the minus p we add one to the exponent so we get minus p plus one one minus p if we drop that into the denominator that's going to be ax plus b to the p minus 1 1 over that oh but we also have to divide by a right there's a one over a coming from the chain rule so there's actually a out there okay plus your c if you like okay and so if we're looking at the improper integral so going from 1 to infinity 1 over ax plus b to the p dx okay well we're going to get the limit as n goes to infinity 1 over a times 1 over oh we also have to divide by we have to divide by the new exponent right forgot that um so we also have a p minus 1 in there or maybe minus 1 plus p so we also have that um right yeah so we have that we have minus p plus one we have one over ax plus b to the p minus one there's our or sorry n i guess i called it n there we go um minus the lower limit if we plug in one what do we get at the lower limit we put in x equal to 1 we get you know some constant right minus we get 1 over a times a plus b times 1 minus p it's a constant um and so we look at this and we say yeah this this here limit what can we say about it this limit is going to be equal to zero is long as p minus one is positive and it's going to be equal to infinity if p minus one is negative right we've already ruled out the p is equal to one case um okay so it's going to converge if p minus one is positive which is the same thing as saying that p is bigger than one which is what we had here right and if and only if because if p is not bigger than one then either um it's equal to one and we know it diverges or it's less than one and we know it diverges okay so either way we know that we have a convergent improper integral if p is bigger than one and so correspondingly we have a convergent p series if p is bigger than one so the next theorem that we want to look at is the direct comparison test okay um so we've stated here's a theorem and the this is the sentence which is direct comparison right here okay so this is direct comparison so if you're able to set up a direct comparison this is typically the simplest argument that you can give for convergence of a series i if we have one series which we know converges and it's easy to show that the terms in some other series are always less than or equal to the corresponding terms in the convergence series then this one must automatically converge as well conversely if if this series diverges right and the other series has terms which are larger then it has to diverge as well one thing that is important here is that they do have to be positive sequences okay the fact that they're positive right means that well if we if we let um let's say s n to be the sum n going from 1 to big n of n and let's call the other one i don't know maybe t just because it's the next letter in the alphabet i call t n sum and going from one to n of b n um so if we define these if we have that and that then these sequences sn and tn well they have to be monotone increasing right because we started with positive sequences so every time we add a new term the sum gets bigger okay so they're monotone increasing this is a useful observation to make one thing that tells us is that if we do have a divergence series if this sum diverges okay well it has to diverge to infinity right has to diverge for infinity the other thing we notice is that well s n has to be always less than or equal to t n maybe i should have used a different letter here um let's call that ten or n naught or something okay for n bigger than or equal to this n naught right so we always allow that maybe your comparison doesn't quite work at the beginning but it works eventually right when we can when we're talking about conversions of series we always care about what happens eventually first few terms aren't that important right first hundred terms thousand terms million terms aren't necessarily important it's only what happens eventually that matters okay so maybe this is a big number it doesn't matter as long as we have this eventually okay so what that tells me is that well if the limit as n goes to infinity of s n is infinity then the limit as n goes to infinity of t tn must also be infinity right um if we have this inequality for all n right this quantity is always bigger than that quantity if this is becoming infinite this one must also become infinite you can prove that straight from the definition of the limit if you want okay on the other hand and so by the way this this proves the second part of the theorem right if s n goes to infinity right that's saying that this series diverges which tells us that this one diverges on the other hand if the limit as n goes to infinity of let's say t n is some value let's i don't know call it uh b why not um well what can we say then well we know that s n has to be less than or equal to t n but t n has to be less than or equal to b right because if if tn is an increasing sequence right it's an increasing sequence it has to be less than or equal to its limit okay because it gets bigger as n increases so does so does tn okay well that means that this sequence is bounded and it's increasing so what do we know about bounded increasing sequences we have the monotone convergence theorem says if you have a bounded increasing sequence it has to converge okay so that's exactly the scenario of the first right so that means that that this sequence converges which is the same thing as saying that the series converges and that proves the first part okay in case you're wondering why it's true there's the argument so direct comparison is pretty straightforward it makes intuitive sense right that if if these numbers are always bigger than those numbers if this converges well this should converge to something smaller it makes sense right similarly if this diverges well this should be bigger than that so it should diverge as well makes sense next we'll look at some examples so we can see how we actually apply this in in practice right and the challenge with using direct comparison is here it's getting that inequality right it's easier said than done sometimes it's straightforward and you can see the inequality and you set it up straight away and everyone's happy sometimes it's tough so we'll look at some easy examples we'll look at some tough examples and then just like for improper integrals when direct comparison fails you ask whether or not there's some sort of limit comparison that you can use and fortunately the answer will be yes all right so here is a quick and easy candidate for direct comparison all right we want to decide if this particular series converges or diverges you might say hey i know i know something about geometric series and when they converge i also know some of the p series and when they converge here we seem to have the two of them sort of jumbled together well what do you do there's actually kind of two ways you could do this right you could say well here's one option we could say since 1 over 3 to the n plus n squared is less than 1 over 3 to the n y why is that true well whatever n is right n squared is a positive number if you add a positive number on the denominator right you're making the denominator bigger that makes the whole thing smaller right so this should be a larger number over here and we know that this converges right well we should probably say y it's geometric with r equals onethird which is less than one then we know that our series converges by comparison that's it that's all you got to say right but make sure you check the boxes what are you comparing two the thing that you're comparing to why does it converge it's geometric why do we know the other one converges well because we're using the comparison test right we should also keep an eye on the requirement that terms be positive but we've got that going for us as well okay now of course you could have gone in another direction with this you could have also said hey i don't need to compare to the geometric series i could also compare all right this one gave us two options we could have also said hey 3 to the n over n squared for the same reasoning is less than 1 over n squared right and i know that this series and going from 1 to infinity 1 over n squared that converges y it's a p series p is equal to two which is bigger than one okay we know that this series converges okay same as before okay of course if we had if we only had say n here rather than n squared series is still going to converge but then option one is the only option right we wouldn't have been able to go to option two all right or you know if this was maybe like one half to the n in here or something where the g matrix series failed well again we could just then rely on the p series in this case we had both options at our disposal pick either one all right here's another example with comparison 1 over n minus log n what do we do with that well let's see you should probably suspect that this diverges why we know that the harmonic series 1 over n we know that that diverges right and subtracting something off from n is only going to make the denominator smaller which is going to make the terms in this series bigger which should mean it still diverges and of course that's the whole point of the comparison test right so let's work that through what do we get uh well we notice that n has to be bigger than or equal to n minus the natural log of n okay um we're working here let's point out this is valid for n bigger than or equal to one right if n is less than one the natural log is negative and this side would actually be bigger but n is bigger than or equal to one so we don't have to worry okay n minus log n the other thing we should worry about though are these terms still positive yes they are that is still bigger than zero all right you can use calculus to check this if you want it's a pretty straightforward comparison to show that n is always bigger than log n okay this is always true um simple to set that up and show it so we know that the terms are positive we have that comparison well since both of these are positive we can take reciprocals inequality diverse reverses and we get that 1 over n is less than or equal to 1 over n minus the natural log of n okay very good and now we can say since the harmonic series diverges and you can however you want to reference this you can point out well it's the harmonic series and that was our like classic example of of a series that diverges despite the fact that the terms go to zero right so it's harmonic um or if you want it's a p series with p equal to one and it's not bigger than one so we know it's going to diverge and whichever reason you want to give we know it diverges we know that this series here 1 over n minus log of n that has to also diverge by comparison that's it we're done all right before we move on from direct comparison next topic is going to be the limit comparison test i'm going to do one more example with direct comparison and i want to do this example to try and convince you why the limit comparison test is useful right direct comparison is nice it gets you the answer really fast if you can set up that inequality if you can't set it up easily maybe you want something better so let's look at these two examples now a part a is straightforward okay let's look at the solution for part a for part a i can simply say that 1 over n squared plus n is now of course i can choose to drop either of these two they're both positive right if i remove either one of them from the sum i'm going to get a smaller number in the denominator so a bigger number overall but i want to keep the one that gives me a conversion series right so 1 over n squared and i know that this series here converges and again we know that converges because it's a ptest p is two it's bigger than one we know that this series converges as well and we can give the reason converges by comparison okay that's not so bad um what about part b so here's where things get a little bit tricky the the intuition that you want to apply is that for rational functions large powers dominate right and so we should look at this and say if i ignore the smaller powers this is effectively a p series p is equal to 2 2 is bigger than 1 i expect it should converge right but it's not exactly a p series so we have to try and compare to one right the only other difference you'll notice i started the sum at 2 because 1 minus 1 would give me a 0 in the denominator which is not good but as long as n is bigger than or equal to two n squared minus n is going to be positive so we have you know we have a positive sequence we're good to go on that um but we can't do the same sort of direct comparison that we just did right if we try it it's it's bound to fail because if i just drop the minus n right that subtracting n is making the denominator smaller if i remove it the denominator gets bigger the overall terms get smaller inequality goes the wrong way so i can't i can't use it right it doesn't work so what do we do well you start fiddling around and you just say like how can i how can i get this thing to go the right way so subtracting n how do we how do we fix it you can mess around there are options like maybe you try to complete the square or something like that i mean that actually is an option you could do that completing this square might work we might try to say something like well you know we know that we know that n n is bigger than or equal to 2 in this scenario if i multiply both sides by by n i know that n squared is bigger than or equal to 2n right i can multiply both as an inequality as long as the thing i'm multiplying by is positive and then i could also multiply by one half so onehalf n squared would be greater than or equal to n okay or in other words minus n okay if i reverse the so move this over minus n will be bigger than or equal to minus one half n squared so i just swap the two sides um and now i can add n squared to both sides n squared minus n is bigger than or equal to n squared minus half n squared which is half n squared very good okay so with all that now i can say that i have my solution right so i can say this i can say since n squared minus n is bigger than or equal to one half n squared i know that one over n squared minus n is less than or equal to 2 over n squared and i know that the sum and going from 2 to infinity of 2 over n squared converges again p test the 2 on top is a constant doesn't matter factor it out it's 1 over n squared i know that the sum for n squared minus n also converges and again it's by comparison by direct comparison all right but that direct comparison was a whole lot harder to set up than this one right you had to come up with this and then you probably don't necessarily come up with that idea on the spot right you're in the middle of an exam maybe you're not going to think about that that's where the limit comparison test comes in right limit comparison is the test to use with that intuition that highest powers are dominant right limit comparison says hey i want to compare this with 1 over n squared the direct comparison doesn't seem to be working out for me maybe there's a simpler way to set this up we'll see that in the next couple of videos all right so now we come to the limit comparison test right so it's still sort of a comparison test um setup is the same as direct comparison we have two positive sequences we're looking at convergence of the corresponding series okay and the limit comparison test is essentially trying to set up this this idea that if we kind of know in the long run how the two sequences compare right then sort of smaller differences that might matter for small values of n don't matter so much for larger values of n they're not so important we just wanted to look about sort of this sort of long term comparison how do they compare once n gets really big okay so if the limit of the ratio is l right what that's telling you is that for large values of n the terms in this sequence are roughly some multiple of the terms in this sequence right a n is approximately l times b n where l is some limit right so they they're kind of the same size right same order of magnitude they agree well not order of magnitude is not the right term but um they they're equal up to a constant multiple right and we know that as far as convergence of a series goes constant multiple doesn't matter if there's a constant multiple you can pull it out right and so these two sequence or these two series either they both converge or they both diverge because the the terms here are behave roughly the same as the terms here for long term right and convergence really depends on longterm behavior what happens for large values of n okay so and then of course it could be that you know so l here needs to be it needs to be positive right it can't be zero and it can't be infinity so what happens if it is zero or infinity uh well if the limit is zero what is that telling you that's telling you that these terms here the bns are growing much faster than the ans right so these ones are growing faster so that means that in the long run the bns are larger than the ans okay so now you're kind of back to direct comparison the bns are eventually larger than the ans otherwise that limit wouldn't be zero and so you know that if the sum of the bn's converges well the bn's are bigger than the n so the ands have to converge right essentially you turn it into into direct comparison okay on the other hand if the limit is infinity well that means that the a ends are growing much faster than the bn's right so the ans are larger in the long run and so if you know that this series diverges this one must as well right um so the the strategy here is always that you want to think of this as like the this series here right the a n this is sort of the one that you're given so you want to think of basically this this is like the the given series and this is the one that you're going to compare to right that's your comparison series um and so this might be you know this might be sort of complicated right you're given some complicated series you want to compare to something that is relatively simple something where you know what the answer is you know if it converges or diverges and and you you want them to be sort of roughly similar in in the sense of longterm behavior like if if if this is some rational expression well then you want to look at largest powers of n right and and set this up based on that um all right so typically you're setting things up so that you you're going to be you way back you know the very first chapter of calculus limits you're doing limits at infinity you're setting it up so that you're going to do something like a limit of a rational function with equal powers top and bottom to try and get that l that's that's the most typical scenario for this right but you want to think of the bn is always your sort of test sequence that you're trying to compare against um so just as a as a quick example so that didn't take too long let's look at that one that we just left off with right we had this sequence 1 over n squared minus n sorry and started at 2 because we don't want to divide by 0. and you say okay i want to decide on convergence of this series by comparison but we just saw that direct comparison is a pain really a pain okay so we want to compare to what should we compare to well we look at this and again the the the intuition here the idea you want to apply is to say well look for large values of n the highest power is going to dominate ignore all the rest right so it's to throw the rest away and what you're left with is your comparison so we want to compare this with the sum and going from 2 to infinity of 1 over n squared and we know that this is a convergent p series right okay so we're going to compare to this convergent p series and we simply say okay let's look um my a n is 1 over n squared minus n b n is 1 over n squared so limit n going to infinity a n over b n we have the limit n going to infinity of well so dividing by b n dividing by 1 over n squared is the same as multiplying by n squared so n squared over n squared minus n okay and that limit is 1 right highest degree top and bottom is equal right power 2 top power 2 bottom we look at the coefficients 1 over 1 we know that limit is 1. okay um and 1 is bigger than 0 it's less than infinity so we know that this sorry going from 2 to infinity n squared minus n converges by the limit comparison test right and you know if you were we had the other example we would do is n squared plus n right so if you had n squared plus n um probably you should do direct comparison you can still do limit comparison this exact same thing is going to work if there was a plus here instead of a minus right you're still going to get one for the limit but this is slightly more work than direct comparison if it's an easy direct comparison right so maybe you want to do direct comparison for plus but you should probably do limit comparison for minus because doing a direct comparison for this we saw that that's actually a fair amount of effort limit comparison is relatively straightforward all right so here's an example applying the limit comparison test we wanted to determine the convergence of this series here we've got one over n plus log n okay now you want to set up a you know you want to set a comparison here and i mean the the nicest direct comparison would be to just drop log n right you drop log n um but then things get bigger right this these terms here are smaller than the harmonic series one over n that tells you nothing because harmonic series diverges and have knowing that your terms are less than a divergent series tells you nothing right you need these to either be bigger than a divergent series or smaller than a convergence series and so you need a little bit of intuition you got to decide off the hop do you think this converges or diverges and then choose your sort of comparator um your the series you want to compare to you choose that wisely all right um it's worth pointing out that you know if you um if you get zero for the limit here and maybe this series diverges um well then then you're you don't really get anywhere right that's a sign that you chose a bad series to compare to right similarly here if you get infinity and this converges you get nothing and it's a sign that you didn't choose very well when you chose that series to compare to okay so here probably you say okay i think i think i'm going to compare this to the harmonic series and going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n we know it diverges but again these terms are larger than those right so the comparison direct comparison doesn't go the right way that said we could have done here if you wanted to do direct comparison we might notice this the natural log of n is always smaller than n so this is going to be bigger than or equal to let's make the denominator a little bit bigger makes this thing smaller and plus n which is just 1 over 2n so if you notice that there is a simple direct comparison right this is just half the harmonic series i pull out the one half harmonic series diverges done but maybe you don't notice that right and that's the whole point so we know that this is the harmonic series we know it diverges okay and so maybe you don't make that observation you still want to show that this series diverges you're pretty sure it diverges so we're going to use not direct comparison we're going to do limit comparison okay so a n is 1 over n plus log n b n is 1 over n so our limit looks like this limit and going from n going to infinity again dividing by 1 over n is like multiplying by n and over n plus the natural log of n let's use l'hopital's rule shall we use l'hopital's rule let's use l'hopital's rule right it's infinity over infinity derivative of n is 1 i mean think of it as x if you want 1 1 1 over n okay n is going to infinity 1 over n is going to go to 0. again we get 1 for the limit so we're in that first case right the limit is 1 so either both diverge or both converge in this case we know that that one diverges so we know that this series diverges from one to infinity by limit comparison okay and we're done all right here's our next example we're going to determine the conversions of this series here which again has sort of one geometric term and a p series term minus instead of plus we already dealt with the plus sign example that was like our very first example that we did right we said hey we can compare with either the geometric or the p series simple inequality direct comparison done the minus sign makes it a lot harder to set up direct comparison so we say okay how else can we determine the convergence um maybe we try for a limit comparison and now of course if you're going to try for a limit comparison you got to decide what are you going to compare two the geometric part the p series part um probably safer to compare with the geometric part exponential functions grow a lot faster than polynomial functions so the 3 to the n is going to dominate long term so we compare to that right so solution looks like this okay so we have a n is 1 over 3 to the n minus n squared and we want to compare to bn and our bn will be 1 over 3 to the n okay and we should probably point out that this is if we do the corresponding series n equals 1 to infinity 1 over 3 to the n is convergent because it's geometric right it's a convergent geometric series we're good to go all right let's take the limit the limit and going trinity a n over b n again dividing by the reciprocal we multiply by 3 to the n through the n minus n squared once again infinity over infinity if we use l'hopital's rule twice right first time around oh you know what let's just do it because it's an exponential but it's not base e it's base 3 we get 3 to the n log 3 3 to the n log three minus two n okay i mean we should put the little h here let me tell the rule and we're gonna do left hill's rule one more time limit and going to infinity 3 to the n times log 3 now squared don't worry about it it's a constant 3 to the n log 3 squared minus 2 let n go to infinity the minus two doesn't matter right we get one in the limit and usual story maybe i'll i'll skip writing down the answer because i want to tell you one more thing but from here we say okay the limit is one so that's our l l is bigger than zero it's less than infinity we know that this series converges now we know that this series converges by limited comparison now you might have been wondering what if you what have you kind of like i don't know you messed up it's not really messed up but maybe you decided to compare with n squared instead right what if you did if you did bn equals 1 over n squared you say hey that's that gives me a convergent p series what would i get then well if i did that then a n over b n i would get instead i would get n squared over 3 to the n minus n squared and we try to take the limit and again you can use l'hopital's rule a couple of times and you find that this is going to go to zero as n goes to infinity um right we don't get a finite value we get zero so did limit comparison did it fail not exactly puts us in case two limit is zero the bn series converges right it's a convergent p series so we know the ans converge as well okay either way it works that's the nice thing about limit comparison there's a fair amount of wiggle room there's cushion built in right it's not quite as sensitive to small mistakes one way or the other limit comparison is sort of a blunt instrument it gets the job done okay so here's our last example using limit comparison it's the last example for this section on limit and comparison tests we want to determine the convergence of this series here right and now um the point that we've tried to drive home with the the examples we've done so far is it limit comparison right it's sort of a blunt instrument it's not particularly sensitive to the small details right we we only really care about sort of largest powers and so here if we're thinking about long run behavior we say what's going to dominate when n is big adding 3 is not going to matter neither is adding 1. neither is subtracting n when you're comparing to n squared right it's just this root n over n squared this stuff here this is the part that matters for large n okay and so we say let's compare so we want to compare a n which is root n plus 3 over n squared minus n plus 1 to b n which will be root n over n squared which is so that's n to the one half n squared right so 2 minus a half is one over n to the three over two okay okay so let's look the limit as n goes to infinity and over b n is going to be the limit n goes to infinity so let's put a n in there root n plus 3 n squared minus n plus 1. and we're dividing by bn which means multiplying by n to the three over two okay so if we multiply that through we get the limit n going to infinity of n squared plus 3 n to the 3 over 2 divided by n squared minus n plus 1. and that limit is one using the typical argument that we just have to look at the largest powers ratio of the coefficients when those largest powers are equal right okay so that limit is one we're in the first case and now we say oh what do we know about the bns um this series n going from one to infinity and one over oops sorry n to the 3 over 2 does it converge or diverge it converges right it's a p series p is equal to three over two which is bigger than one we know that our original series root n plus three n squared minus n plus one it must also converge using the limit comparison test okay that's it but again the point is that you do not want to be handling something like that by direct comparison right limit comparison gives you a straightforward way of setting up a comparison letting you compare a complicated series with a simple one where we have a known result and all it's going to cost you is a limit at infinity using techniques that you learned in calc 1. all right so our next topic is the ratio test so the ratio test is stated here is a theorem again the assumption is that we're dealing with a positive sequence so our series is summing positive terms we aren't alternating signs at all and the ratio test gives you a simple thing to consider it says just look at the ratio of consecutive terms in your sequence a n plus 1 over a n if that limit comes out to a value which is less than one you know your sequence converges if it's bigger than one the series diverges sorry i said sequence meant series so series converges if l is less than one diverges if l is bigger than one and if you actually get one on the nose then the ratio test fails right so the test tells you nothing if that limit happens to be equal to one um so one of the things that's kind of important now that we're sort of building up our arsenal of tests right we have geometric series now we have p series telescoping series i mean there's not really a test there you just have to recognize it as telescoping we have the integral test we have comparison test limit comparison now ratio soon root right um solving problems involving sequences in series is all about choosing the right tool for the job and it's about doing enough problems that you're able to recognize what the right tool is going to be okay so for example the ratio test is not the right tool for a p series right if you think about a p series right if my a n is is 1 over n to the p right and if i was looking at well what do i get for a n plus 1 over a n well i'm going to get n over n plus 1 to the p after a bit of simplifying right and that's going to go to 1 in the limit right so the ratio test is useless for p series but that's okay because we already know how to handle p series right we just have to look at that value of p is it bigger than one or is it less than one right um so the ratio test is not helpful for p series but it is helpful for a lot of other series in particular ratio test definitely takes care of geometric series right think about a geometric series if n looks like r to the n right well then a n plus 1 over a n is going to be r to the n plus one over r to the n which is r um and as we already know geometric series converges precisely for for positive r converges precisely when r is less than one okay we can see that again with the ratio test in fact the way you actually understand why the ratio test works the way you would prove it is is using something that is sort of based on the geometric series test it's realizing that okay you know what is what are we really saying when we say that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus 1 over a n is equal to l well this sort of means that you know a n plus 1 is approximately a n times l for large n right and if you think about well okay so this is i mean this is not a proof by any means but just think of it this way so so a n plus 1 is just l times a n right and then a n plus 2 would be l times a n plus 1 would be l times l times a n and you can sort of you know get from here to say well that means that you know a n plus k is like a n times l to the k right and so then you sort of think about what happens as k gets really large and you say well this is more or less behaving like a geometric series right it's not exactly a geometric series because you know this is only an approximation it's not exact but with the definition of the limit right if you bring in you know the epsilon definition of the limit we can say for a large enough n we can make the difference between this ratio and l less than epsilon we can work out what that means and we can make this precise right so this is one way to think about why the ratio test works it's essentially taking much more general series and in a sense comparing them to a geometric series right but using the machinery of a limit to set up that comparison okay so that's one way to understand why it works certainly not a proof but it gives you some idea of the concept with that under our belts we'll move on and we'll look at some examples all right so here's our first example with the ratio test three series one two three i put three over here short on space um we want to see if we can use the ratio test to determine convergence of these series now the ratio test tends to work really well for things like powers and factorials right um you know exponential so we mentioned that you know the ratio test is sort of closely related to geometric series so when you see exponential functions you expect that the the ratio test is probably going to be good for for factorials the reason why the ratio test works really well for factorials is you might recall that the factorial can be defined sort of recursively right n plus 1 factorial can be written as n plus 1 times n factorial that observation frequently comes in handy because in this case we would say that our a n okay a n is 2 to the n over n factorial and so we want to set up this ratio a n plus 1 over a n so that's going to look like 2 to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 factorial divide by a n we just multiply by the reciprocal okay n factorial over 2 to the n right and now we can see that there's there's some cancellation that goes on right 2 to the n plus 1 of course we can might as well why not mention that one two though i think everyone knows this 2 to the n plus 1 we can always write as 2 times 2 to the n right laws of exponents n plus 1 so 2 to the n times 2 to the 1. there we go and so we see that actually quite a bit cancels here 2 to the n is going to cancel with all but one of those twos the n factorial cancels with well the factorial if you like right this n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1 times n plus n factorial cancel the factorials and we see that the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 over a n well it turns out once you simplify that's just the limit of two over n plus one and that limit is zero zero is definitely less than one and so our conclusion here is that the series converges okay so far so good moving on to the next one now for this next one there there are ways to answer this without maybe even applying a test depending on how comfortable you are with the sort of longterm behavior of various different types of functions right one of the things that you might have encountered if you've been playing around with these things is that factorials grow much faster than exponential functions right because two to the n every time you mult you know increase n by one you're multiplying by two up here but down here you're multiplying by one larger right first you're multiplying by two over two then two over three then two over four then two over five right so this this is getting bigger on the bottom right exponential functions in turn they grow much faster than power functions and power polynomials in general right so we expect that actually here the numerator is growing faster than the denominator and you could just apply this sort of basic test for divergence right you could say well look at a n here is 3 to the n over n cubed and you could say hey look the um the limit as this the limit of a n as n goes to infinity the limit of this thing it's it's actually infinite because it's infinity over infinity but use l'hopital's rule three times you're just left with six on the bottom you'll still have three to the n on top it's going to go to infinity right um so so this series here fails that most basic test for divergence right which says that the only you know if the terms in your sequence that you're summing right if the ans if they don't go to zero you know that your series diverges um so this is enough of an observation to point out that the series has to diverge okay because it goes to infinity of course you could also you know we're supposed to be practicing the ratio test right so we could also see this from the ratio test if we look at well what is a n plus 1 over a n so this is my a n here and so if i put n plus 1 in there i get 3 to the n plus 1 n plus 1 cubed times so 1 over a n will be n cubed over over 3 to the n okay so that's going to give me 3 times n cubed over n plus 1 cubed and in the limit that's going to go to 1 1 times 3 goes to 3 3 is bigger than 1 so ratio test says it diverges right okay so we can do that what about this one here now this is very similar to the p series we talked about in the last video we said ratio test is useless for this and you can go ahead and you can check the ratio test is useless if you try to apply the ratio test you're going to get a rational function and it's going to have the same power top and bottom it's going to be n squared the limit is going to be 1 ratio test fails but we don't need the ratio test for this we know that this converges this converges by comparison right it converges by comparison with the p series 1 over n squared because 1 over n squared plus 1 is slightly smaller than 1 over n squared right so the ratio test is not always the right tool for the job even here even something like this where it really looks like you know it's the right sort of you know ratio test loves power function loves not power functions but exponential functions um it's the sort of form that works for a ratio test and yes you can use rescue tests but maybe you don't need to right as as you move through tests of sort of higher and higher degrees of sophistication sometimes you forget that you can come back to these very simple rules that we started out with they can also do the job for you all right so here's a more challenging example we've got a lot of factorials in there ratio test is the right tool for the job when you see factorials frequently is at least um but i mean n factorial you know we've got the square of n factorial on the top on the bottom now be careful that's not just twice n factorial right if it was just 2 times n factorial we'd cancel we'd simplify a piece of cake no this means we we double n and then we take the factorial right um so 2n factorial is is way way way bigger than n factorial right is it bigger than n factorial squared um yeah of course because here you multiply by the first n integers and then you multiply by the first n integers again down here you multiply by the first n integers and then you multiply by the next n integers it's a lot bigger okay so the denominator is definitely larger than the numerator seems like maybe it's going to work out for us but let's let's apply the ratio test and be sure okay so let's see a n in this case is n factorial n factorial 2 n factorial and so let's look what do we get when we do a n plus 1 over a n so we have n plus 1 factorial n plus 1 factorial over 2 so do it this way 2 times n plus 1 factorial that's going to be 2n plus 2 factorial on the bottom right okay multiply by 1 over a n so we flip this thing over 2n factorial n factorial n factorial okay so remember now that n plus one factorial we can write as n plus one times n factorial we do that twice so n plus one squared n factorial squared on the bottom this is two n plus two so it's two n plus two times two n plus one times two n factorial okay then we have 2n factorial n factorial squared if we want to write it like that and now we look for cancellations and there are a lot of them those cancel that cancels okay and we're just left with n plus 1 squared over 2n plus 2 times two n plus one um you can probably see how that's going to go but maybe just to make things crystal clear let's multiply these things out okay four n squared plus two n plus four n six n plus two okay so what's the limit the limit as n goes to infinity of a n plus one over a n well it's one over four all right it's a rational function top degree is n squared top and bottom and 1 over 4 is less than 1 and that means that the series converges by the ratio test there we go all right so next up is the root test root test looks an awful lot like the ratio test in fact all i had to do is come through and change a few pieces here right so in the root test it's called the root test because you look at the nth root of a n right as n goes to infinity so both the the degree of the root goes up as n increases right so another way to write that usually more convenient is to write that as a n to the power 1 over n right so we're looking at increa fractional powers with increasingly large denominator okay and we're letting n go to infinity here now it looks a lot like the ratio test and with good reason this is yet another variation on the theme of geometric series right notice that if a n is r to the n well then a n to the one over n is r to the n to the one over n which is just r right and we know that a geometric series is going to converge for r less than one it's going to diverge for or bigger than one of course if it's a geometric series on the nose we also know it diverges for r equal to one but it's not exactly a geometric series here so we can't really say anything if our you know if this limit is equal to one right um so the idea here is that well if if a n to the one over n right um if n is large sufficiently large right a n to the 1 over n is approximately equal to the limit l whatever it has happens to be and that suggests that a n something you know it goes something like l to the n so it really is again trying to take whatever series you have and approximate it by a geometric series and then use what we know about geometric series to decide on convergence at the limit that's the strategy here okay and again it's not on the nose it's only approximate but it gives you an idea of what's going on one reminder for positive constants if you think about taking roots of constants um for numbers that are between zero and one if you take the root of a number between zero and one it actually gets a little bit bigger right like square root of a quarter is a half take the square root of a number that's bigger than one it gets smaller um so for a positive constant if you take that constant to the power one over n and ask where it goes it goes to 1 as n goes to infinity that's often a useful observation to make of course you can show that using calculus if you like but we'll just make that as an observation in case it comes up in some of the following examples all right so we'll end this section by looking at a few examples that apply the root test to determine convergence now one of the things you'll probably find as you're working through problems is that you don't use the root test nearly as often as you use the ratio test right 19 times out of 20 you probably go for the ratio test over the root test um but there are scenarios where the root test is much more effective here's one i think where it's probably clear that it's easy to use the root test because and well a n is three n plus one over five n minus two to the power of n and if we wanna now take that and raise it to the power 1 over n right well those two exponents they cancel each other out right nth power nth root those cancel we just get three n plus one over five n minus two well that means that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n to the one over n well this is rational same power top and bottom we look at the coefficients the limit is three over five three over five is less than one and that means the series converges okay that works out for us now you could probably also do this using you could try using the ratio test i think you would find that ratio test will also work for you root test just happens to be cleaner in this particular case okay if we look at the next one a n we have n to the fourth over log n to the nth power so again we're going to raise that to the power 1 over n okay and what we get is we get n to the 4 oops sorry 1 over n let's be careful here we get n to the 4 over n on top we get the natural log of n on the bottom uh now one of the results that actually um i mentioned this before if you have a constant to the one over n you let n go into infinity that's typically going to go to one okay that's kind of clear right i mean if n goes to infinity 1 over n is going to go to 0 constant raised to the power of 0 should give you 1. it's actually also true though that if you take n to the power 1 over n that will also go to 1 as n goes to infinity and n to the four over n will just be well n to the one over n raised to the fourth power one to the fourth power still one okay um so if you take the limit of this one as n goes to infinity so we have n to the 4 over n divided by log n well this limit is going to be zero okay because the top is approaching one the bottom goes to infinity one over infinity gives you gives you zero right um if you want to go into detail on this you can play around with indeterminate forms l'hopital's rule um i mean the whole thing is not even indeterminate right one over infinity is not indeterminate we get zero the main thing is making sure that you can see that that top is actually going to one if this isn't clear to you remember you can always rewrite let me just put this as an aside you can always say hey you know what n to the 4 over n i can write as e to the log of n to the 4 over n but then the 4 over n comes down you get that right and if you let n go to infinity log n over n goes to zero e to the zero is one that's where the one comes from okay coming to the last one let's try the last one um a n to the 1 over n is going to be 2 to the n to the 1 over n divided by n squared to the 1 over n so we get 2 over n to the 2 over n and using the same reasoning as here this is going to go to 1 that's just a 2. that goes to 2 2 is bigger than 1. right probably forgot to mention in this case here right limit is 0 well 0 is less than 1. so that second series also converges the third one diverges right we get 2 for the limit 2 is bigger than 1 root test says it says it diverges and by the way for that third one you probably in practice don't use the root test test for divergence the simple test for divergence tells you already that this series has to diverge because if you take the limit of just the sequence as n goes to infinity already you get infinity right 2 to the n grows a lot faster than n squared the terms don't go to zero end of story you could also do the ratio test ratio test would be easy to apply here but the root test also gets the job done all right so the next topic we want to look at is alternating series so the definition is here an alternating series is a series of one of the following forms so we have these a n's are still kind of positive so you still start with a positive sequence like usual um but you put this sign factor in front right so minus 1 to the n right that alternates sign if it's if n is even this is plus 1 if n is odd that's minus 1 swaps back and forth in sine so this is how you you see the terms right so this is going to be you know this would be like minus a1 plus a2 minus a3 plus a4 and so on right so the sign changes um if you want the first term to be positive then you do minus one to the n plus one right so either way we consider it an alternating series whether the first term is positive or negative doesn't matter what matters is that the sign alternates between positive and negative okay now the surprising thing is that for alternating series right we we know that this condition here on its own this condition is not sufficient for convergence right we've seen this we've seen that the series sum of n going from one to infinity one over n this diverges all right this is the harmonic series okay harmonic series diverges the p series with p is equal to one there are other ways to prove it but this you know integral test does it but there are direct proofs as well that is a divergent series despite the fact that the terms go to zero okay but nonetheless if we have a sequence where the ans are positive right so this uh oh let's be careful hahaha i forgot the minus one all right hope you weren't watching the video and turn it off before we got to that correction okay we need the minus one to the n in there minus 1 to the n times a n it needs to be an alternating series right so the a n's are positive so that this becomes alternating for an alternating series as long as the ends are positive and they're decreasing then it turns out it is good enough to have the ans go to zero right so this harmonic series diverges but the alternating harmonic series and going from one to infinity minus 1 to the n plus 1 over n that converges right happens to converge in fact to the natural log of 2 if you can believe it right so we'll we'll encounter this a number of times right where the alternating series will converge but the corresponding nonalternating series if you drop the sine factor and you just look at the sum of the a n's without the minus 1 to the n in front right whether that minus 1 to the n that series may very well diverge but you simply put this alternating sign in there and suddenly the series converges which is kind of interesting and the idea is that you sort of if you're looking at the partial sums you sort of you know you start with let's say a1 is positive right so you start it like here's zero right and and you add a one so you're kind of out here here's a1 right and now you subtract a2 but when you subtract a2 you know you get to a2 is less than a1 so we don't make it all the way back to here maybe we make it to here right and there's a1 minus a2 and then we add on a3 so we get a bit bigger all right um a1 minus a2 plus a3 right i mean maybe we go even further but you know a3 is less than a2 so we don't make it past where we were before right we make it out to there or maybe up to there and then we subtract and we get a bit smaller and so you kind of you're moving back and forth back and forth but the amount that you're adding or subtracting is getting smaller every time right and so if you look at the partial sums when n is odd in this scenario here the partial sub n is odd you know they start big but they get smaller so you have a you have a decreasing sequence that's bounded below by zero right and if you look at the even terms you have an increasing sequence that's bounded above say by a1 right so you've got two bounded monotone sequences you know that they have to converge and the main thing is showing that they converge to the same limit um once you've established that you get this theorem okay so we'll look at a few examples we'll see how the alternating series test applies and then when we come back to this question of you know convergence of the alternating series versus the corresponding nonalternating series this gets us to absolute convergence absolute convergences well what happens if you take the absolute value drop the minus sign do you still have convergence or not right that's going to be an important question the other thing that we we don't have time to talk is an interesting thing but it's beyond the scope of a calculus curse turns out that in cases where the alternating series converges but the nonalternating series doesn't this is referred to as conditional convergence um and it turns out that conditional convergence is sort of a it's a fragile thing it depends on the order in which you write down the terms which is kind of an odd thing to think about but it sort of comes to playing around with you know if you added a whole bunch of the positive terms and then some of the negative and then a bunch more the positive and then some of the negative ones um there's a surprising thing it's an interesting theorem that one can prove it's a very difficult theorem but it can be done once you have an alternating series you can rearrange the order in which the terms appear to get any real number you want which is bizarre right for for a term for a series with only positive terms you get a limit and that limit is unique there's only one possible value but for alternating series just changing the order around gets you different answers it's bizarre it's a strange thing beyond beyond what we can talk about in a calculus course but if you go on and you take a course in let's say real analysis you might get to play with some of these ideas all right so here are three series we want to know whether the alternating series test sometimes abbreviate ast now we want to know if it can be applied the first one is the one we just talked about it's the alternating harmonic series right the underlying sequence if we ignore the minus 1 to the n plus 1 is just a n is is one over n and so let's see this is is positive it's decreasing and we also know that the limit as n goes to infinity of a n is zero right so we check those three boxes right um and this is the interesting thing about alternating series tests you are just checking boxes right it's it's there's hypotheses there's a conclusion right so there are three things in the hypothesis sequence is positive sequence is decreasing sequence has zero for the limit if you can check those three boxes your sequence converges okay so that's it we know it converges um as i mentioned later on we'll see that it converges to natural log of 2 but for now we know at least that it converges okay what about this next one well we've got the appropriate form right we've got the minus 1 to the n log n over n so a n is log n over n um so let's see we need to check positive we need to check decreasing and we need to check the limit all right so let's have a look is it a positive sequence um well okay log of one is zero so the first term is zero but after that we're fine so let's say positive sometimes we allow zero for positive it's at least nonnegative what about decreasing if you try the first couple values of n you might find that it's going up right so then you get a little bit worried you're like oh it's not decreasing it looks like the values are going up can't apply the alternating series test on the other hand the limit is zero right simple application of l'hopital's rule will tell you that it's infinity over infinity as n goes to infinity take the derivative of the top you get one over n bottom is just one that limit goes to zero check but it doesn't seem to be decreasing so you worry that you can't apply the alternating series test but let's let's take a look at if you take a look at the function right you look at f of x if f x is log x over x then f prime of x if we do the quotient rule we get the derivative of the top 1 over x times the bottom x 1 over x times x is 1 minus top times the derivative of the bottom just log x bottom squared well that's going to be less than zero for log x bigger than one which is the same thing as saying that x has to be bigger than well e is not an integer but um it'll work for three right um so it's decreasing for n bigger than or equal to 3 and that's good enough right nobody cares about the first couple terms right if you're deciding on convergence the first couple terms is not going to change whether or not the series converges you just drop them off the end figure out the rest works out as long as it's eventually decreasing you're fine okay so that works but then we come to this last one we've got sine of n over n squared okay the absolute value make sure that things are positive so we've got that again definitely the limit is zero right because this is bounded and n squared is going to go to infinity but it's not decreasing okay the terms are not decreasing because sine of n is going to oscillate between 0 and 1. it's going to take values between 0 and 1 and it's going to keep doing that forever right as n goes off to infinity there are going to be values that are close to one they're going to be values that are close to zero right um so yeah it's bouncing around on us it's not it's not strictly decreasing and there's no way to make it strictly decreasing so in this case um we're out of luck maybe it still converges in fact it does we'll see soon that uh if the c cons if the series converges without the minus one to the n in there this will be called absolute convergence if you can show it converges without that term then it converges with if you put that term in okay so it does converge um and it converges just by comparison with the p series right 1 over n squared so it converges but you can't establish that convergence using the alternating series test you need to use a different theorem to show that it converges all right so the next result we want to talk about is the approximation theorem for alternating series the theorem's a bit of a mouthful but the idea is pretty simple okay the idea is that you can actually approximate an alternating series pretty well by any of its partial sums right so remember that to to satisfy the hypotheses of the alternating series test the terms in this sequence they have to be positive they have to be decreasing and they have to go to zero in the limit right so these numbers are getting smaller and smaller they're getting closer and closer to zero okay because your alternating in sign as you add them we talked about in the very first video for this section we said well you know what what happens is you know you kind of have you know maybe somewhere here is like the actual limit of your sequence right and so you kind of put the first term in and so maybe maybe like zero is over here right maybe here is zero and you add you add a1 and you get to here and then you subtract a2 right and so then you subtract off a2 and well a2 has to be smaller than a1 so it doesn't get you all the way back to zero maybe it gets you to there all right and so maybe we'll we'll kind of think about it like this way we'll sort of think about the difference from l so a2 gets you to here all right there's a1 plus or a1 sorry minus a2 right and then you add on a3 you add a3 onto here and because a3 is smaller than a2 it's not going to get you all the way back to a1 it's going to get you maybe to here right okay so here will be a1 minus a2 plus a3 and then you subtract off a4 and a4 well it can't take you back that far because it's smaller than a 3 was so maybe it gets you to say here right so then you're kind of over here and there's there's a1 minus a2 plus a3 minus a4 and now you add on a5 and it can't take you all the way back to there so maybe a5 gets you to there right and so on so let's call this maybe to simplify that should be now s5 right the fifth partial sum right and then s6 might be here s7 might be might be there right so you get closer and closer to l every at every you're jumping back and forth over the limit and every time the jumps get smaller right so that means the the difference between the partial sum that you have here and the limit right well it's always got to be less than the next term because then when you add the next term it takes you to the other side of the limit right it takes you past the limit past the limit so the difference between the limit and the partial sum right the limit of this so the actual series or the infinite series the difference between them it's always less than the next term in the sequence so that's a really useful result that means if you you know if you want to approximate a series because calculating the actual sum of an infinite series is in general very difficult right i mean there's lots of them where we don't even know what the value is but we can figure out what it is approximately because it's easy to calculate the next term in the in the sequence right if we have a formula for the sequence we can calculate the next term figure out how big it is and what that sort of lets us do is say hey this gives us sort of a bound on the error right and that means if we if it's good enough to know the sum of the series accurate to let's say three decimal places well we just have to keep going until these numbers are small enough right once they're less than you know one over five thousand then we know we've got the answer accurate to to five decimal places right and in fact we can we can always just kind of look at the two partial sums consecutive partial sums the limits always in between them right so you just kind of look at consecutive partial sums until the interval between them is small enough and you know that you've got the you know the error that you want right so that's the idea we'll look at a couple of examples and then we'll move on we'll talk about absolute convergence after this all right so we're going to introduce a little bit more terminology here um we'll talk about convergent um series and we're talking two different types of convergence now absolute conversions versus conditional convergence so series converges absolutely if you can take the absolute value of every term in the sequence and the series still converges okay it converges conditionally if this if the series converges but once you take the absolute value it no longer converges right so the the standard example of course is the alternating harmonic series right so the alternating harmonic series minus 1 to the n over n well that converges conditionally right we know that that series converges by the alternating series test but we also know that if we take the absolute value right what happens if you take the absolute value of minus one to the n you just get one right so the absolute value gives you the harmonic series and we know that the harmonic series diverges okay so that's an example of a conditionally convergence here a series okay main results on conditional versus absolute convergence well we have a theorem and the theorem states and you can maybe guess based on the definition that um if a series converges absolutely then it just converges it'll stop right so in other words if the series with the absolute values converges then the corresponding series without the absolute value will also converge right so absolute convergence is a much stronger condition than simple convergence right any absolutely convergence series will converge but conditionally convergent series don't necessarily converge absolutely so this is an important result this comes in handy in a lot of scenarios and and we also mentioned another thing that comes up and again we're not going to address this in a calculus course but if a series converges absolutely alternating or otherwise an absolutely convergent series converges to unique limit there's only one possible value whereas as i mentioned a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged and so you can tell with different rearrangements of this series and there's there's a whole sort of you know section you could study on rearrangements and what can you do there and and you can go through this proof that um you can get any number you want by rearranging a conditionally conversion series which seems really bizarre happens to be true so next up what we want to do is we just want to look at a few examples to see if we can if we can apply this definition and tell the difference between convergent and absolutely convergent series all right so here are three examples of alternating series and we want to decide if they converge absolutely or only conditionally or perhaps not at all looking at the first one right if we if we look at our terms a n n plus 3 over n squared plus 2n plus 5. well we might notice that those are approximately 1 over n for n large right so okay we can do limit comparison right using limit comparison we know that this is going to diverge if we take the absolute value right so without the absolute value we know that that this if we take the absolute value sorry taking the absolute value we know that this diverges right and we do a simple limit comparison for that but it does converge terms are positive they go to zero in the limit and they're decreasing you can check you can use you can use the derivative right we can take the function look at the derivative figure out where it's where it's decreasing it's more work than we can fit on the board here but you can check that they that this does satisfy the conditions of the alternating series test so it is a convergent alternating series um um so in this case we get converges so this will be conditional convergence all right converges conditionally because this does converge alternating series test says that it does but if you drop the minus one to the n it diverges okay it's essentially the alternating harmonics series with a bit of clutter very good moving on to this one um well here we've got that exponential on the bottom we expect that's probably going to win out over a polynomial on the top so we might suspect absolute convergence in this case and if we look at a n to be n squared plus 2n plus 5 over 2 to the n this looks like something where maybe we'd use ratio test right ratio possibly root root is going to get ugly with that polynomial though so let's do ratio right a n plus 1 over a n we get n plus one squared plus two times n plus one plus five over two to the n plus one multiply by two to the n over n squared plus two n plus five okay so that's going to be one half times this polynomial which we can we can multiply the whole thing out if we care to i use n squared 2n to n 4n plus 1 plus 2 plus 5 something like that details don't really matter down here do they um n squared plus two n plus five okay so if we wanted to apply the ratio test we take the limit of that thing as n goes to infinity uh it's going to go to one half as n goes to infinity and so this one is absolutely convergent by the ratio test right um frequently when we're applying the ratio test test uh we we often use the ratio test as a test for absolute convergence so if if we do have sine factors to deal with we just take the absolute value when we apply the ratio test you're going to see that in the next section when we talk about power series okay the last one well okay the last one diverges we don't have to do any work why does it diverge look at the terms here as n goes to infinity that's going to three over five right so the limit doesn't go to zero right it fails the test for divergence if the uh if a n doesn't go to zero and then goes to infinity we know it can't possibly converge absolutely or otherwise this one just diverges full stop the next topic we want to look at is tailored polynomials now depending on on how your calculus course is sequenced this might be something that you're looking at in the chapter on derivative applications immediately following differentials or it might be something that you're seeing in the context of sequences in series and you've just looked at power series and we're trying to make our way towards taylor series so we'll try to do this so it fits both and we'll probably take this perspective of we're moving on from the linear approximation right the tangent line approximation and we're trying to improve that approximation right and then whether you're thinking this is an application of derivatives or whether you're you're thinking about why taylor series makes sense in either context this will uh this will work out all right so we know that this linear approximation right it works well it works well as long as we stay close to this point right so there's some point you know c here and so if we go from c to c plus delta x then yeah there's not much difference between the y values along the curve and the y values along the tangent but only in some little interval here right once we move out to say here that gap's getting big out here the gap's getting bigger once we're out here the gap is huge right and it's a terrible approximation right it's only a good approximation on a fairly small interval right so if you're interested in improving your approximation there are two choices that you have one is to shrink the interval over which you're making that approximation right you say well look once delta x hits 0.5 the approximation is not good enough let's get down to 0.1 let's get down to 0.01 right but maybe you can't reach the values you need to reach by shrinking the interval maybe you need to approximate the function out here using values of the function over here right so that might not be an option so if you can't shrink the interval you look for better ways of approximating right so we know that if we have this l of x right so this is going to be f of c plus f prime of c times x minus c and this is the linear approximation right so the next thing you might ask is can we do can we do something like i don't know let's call it q q for quadratic right could we do something like q of x equals and i don't know maybe the coefficients are going to look different but maybe there's a there's an a0 term right a1 we'll work in powers of x minus c you'll see that's going to be convenient right and and maybe now we go to a second order term right and so we say okay is there is there such a thing as a quadratic approximation can we do that does that even make sense um all right so of course adding on that second order term gives some curvature right we know the second derivative is where you start curving away from just being a line so maybe maybe this quadratic right maybe it does something like this all right all right so you get a better approximation for a larger range of x values that's what we're hoping for okay um maybe you can go to cubic right maybe you can go to maybe like there's a c of x all right so there's like a like a b zero plus b one plus b2 b3 times x minus c cubed right maybe there's a cubic and what's that going to look like right so so you play around and you you try to figure this out like can we can we make these approximations and and how are they going to look and maybe the cubic right maybe the cubic does something like you know maybe the cubic does something like that right and you you improve the approximation a little bit more that's what we're trying to accomplish with taylor polynomials that's where we're heading okay is we want to we want to introduce polynomials of higher and higher degree so that we improve on the linear approximation right so we're going to keep adding you know we'll do linear then quadratic then cubic then maybe degree 4 degree 5 degree 6. we'll keep going until we cover as much of the original graph as we need to and as closely as we need to right so the idea is as we add terms we hope that two things happen one is that over the original interview interval that we had our approximation is better than what we had before but also that we can widen the interval and have a reasonable approximation for a a wider range of x values okay we want those two things to happen so in the next video we'll play around with this we'll talk about well how do you decide what these coefficients should be how do we kind of you know get things so that it's a good fit and once we play around with that we're going to arrive at the formula for the coefficients in what's called a taylor polynomial then we'll be able to look at some examples okay so in the last video we introduced this idea that maybe if we if we start adding some higher degree terms onto our linear approximation we can improve over that original tangent line approximation right we can we can get some some curves that match the original graph better and for a better range of values so the problem becomes one of determining what these coefficients should be right and if you're wondering why i chose powers of x minus c rather than simply powers of x well that's because we want to make the comparison at this value x minus or x equals c right so it's nice to be able to just plug in x equals c and of course if you do that all these terms are going to go away right so so let's say we wanted to find q of x what are some things that we're going to require well the minimum requirement that we should put on this thing is that it should agree with the original function at that point right so at c we should have equality exact equality so q of c should equal f of c right makes sense right they should they should touch at that point okay so that means that f of c should be equal to well a zero right because if i put x equals c in here i get zero 0 right so q of c is just a 0 right so now we know what a 0 should be ok what's the next sort of reasonable thing that you might ask um well we probably want them to have the same tangent line at that point right we want we want them to have the same slope as they pass through right if i if i had my curve and i was trying to approximate by a quadratic that agreed at that point but the slopes didn't agree right i probably have something that looks like that that's not going to be a good approximation right so the two curves should be tangent to each other at x equals c well how do i guarantee that the curves are tangent to each other their first derivatives should be equal so q prime of c should be equal to f prime of c right but what's q prime of c well we can just we can take the derivative um this is a constant term so it goes away q prime of c well let's say q prime of x to begin with q prime of x is going to be a 1 times the derivative of x minus c which is just 1. so this is just a 1 right here we can use the power rule plus chain rule 2 comes down in front 2 times a 2 times x minus c times 1 right the derivative of the inside is just 1. so that means that q prime of c is well again this is going to go to 0 so q prime of c is just a 1 and that's what we want to be f prime of c okay so notice what we have so far right this is going to be f of c f prime of c times x minus c so far it looks exactly like the linear approximation but we have this one more term right so now we come to well how do we deal with that last term again we we say okay so we want we want the quadratic to be tangent right so but there's lots of ways that we might set things up so that a quadratic is tangent right maybe we have it kind of come in and and it does i don't know sort of something like this right um that doesn't look like a graph of a function but still the next thing that you want is is you want to say something about the curvature right so for example if we're if we were looking let's say at a maximum or a minimum right i could draw i could draw a quadratic like this right and it would be tangent these two curves are tangent to each other they have the same function value they have the same first derivative at that point right but their second derivatives are way off they're not even the same sign right so the next thing that you probably want is you want to make sure that they kind of curve the same at that point and we know that curvature is concavity is second derivative so the second derivative of q should equal the second derivative of f okay and we say what's q double prime well we just take the derivative here that's the constant it goes away right the constant term always disappears then we have 2 a 2 well times 1. okay so this of course that's a constant so that's also the value of q prime of c so q prime of c is 2 a 2 and we want that to equal f prime of c and that means that a 2 we have to divide by 2 right or f double prime should be f double prime of c over 2. okay so it's not simply just putting the second derivative in there right we have to account for the fact that as we take derivatives of power functions right the powers come down so we can put that in f double prime of c over 2 times x minus c squared and now you've got yourself a quadratic approximation right and if you wanted to do cubic well it's going to be the same story right the work that we did here it's going to be exactly the same right you follow through the steps because what would happen is that cubic term would be along for the ride right if we were doing it here we'd still have the 3 would come down we'd have 3 b 3 x minus c squared still goes away when you plug in the c x equals c right then you'd come down to here when you did this derivative you'd have the 2 a 2 you'd have a 3 times 2 times b3 times x minus c so again it goes away when you get to the third derivative what you're going to find is that c triple prime of x or if you like um because i shouldn't have used c c and c oh well you're going to get it's going to be 3 times 2 times b3 okay and you'd want that to be equal to f triple prime at c so you work that out and you'd find that okay so c the cubic approximation should be should be f of c f prime of c x minus c f double prime of c over two times x minus c squared and then f triple prime over six times x minus c cubed okay and then you got the cubic approximation and and from here you start thinking you try to figure out what's the pattern where is this going to go from here once you figure out what the pattern is you can write down this general formula for what are called taylor polynomials and we'll do that in the next video all right so now we come to the definition of a taylor polynomial okay so we in the last video we kind of played around we started with the linear approximation and then we asked ourselves you know what if we wanted to move to quadratic approximation what if we wanted to move to a cubic what would the coefficients of those polynomials look like right so you try to generalize that pattern and what you come up with is the definition of a taylor polynomial so the notation that's used in the apex textbooks is just p sub n sometimes you'll see additional decorations here in the subscript you might see p sub n you might see a comma f to indicate the function f you might see a comma c to indicate the point c most of the time we hope that that's clear from the context and just write simply p sub n so p n of x right is going to be f of c plus f prime of c times x minus c there's the linear approximation next term f double prime at c over 2. and i'm going to write that 2 as a 2 factorial you'll see why it helps us follow a pattern x minus c squared and we keep going all the way down to a degree n term so we use brackets to indicate derivative right so the n in the bracket means nth derivative nth derivative at c divide by n factorial multiplied by x minus c to the nth power right so the last power that you have is the degree n term right so if it's degree zero well it's just a number that's not very interesting the degree one taylor polynomial is the linear approximation the degree two taylor polynomial is the quadratic approximation right uh and then degree three and so on you can go up to well really any degree that you want okay so that's your taylor polynomial um if you like you can write this in summation notation as the sum k going from 0 to n of the kth derivative at c divided by k factorial times x minus c to the k right and for for those of you that are watching this in the context of sequences in series you've seen power series and so you can probably guess what's going to happen next you let this sum go not to n we're not going to stop at a polynomial we're going to go all the way to a power series we're going to let k go from 0 to infinity and then you have a taylor series right those of you who are seeing this in calculus 1 you're going to stop at degree n right we haven't talked about sequences in series yet okay so that's the formula for taylor polynomials right um that factorial just as a reminder right k factorial is notation for the product of the first k integers so 1 times 2 and so on up to k right so 1 factorial is just 1 2 factorial 1 times 2 which is 2 3 factorial 1 times 2 times 3 which is 6. we saw that in the in the last video for the cubic and so on right and these factorials they grow very fast right 4 factorial 24 not so big 5 factorial 120 6 factorial 720 right 7 factorial is like 5040 right 8 factorial now you're into like the 40 thousands right they they grow very big very fast okay to make this formula work there's a there's a convention right that zero factorial is defined to be one um right so that you can write all the terms there are other reasons why zero factorial should be one other than making the formula work but at this point in your career you can tell yourself that's why if if you like and of course the whole point of this taylor polynomial is that for k equal to 0 1 2 all the way up to n if you take k derivatives of this polynomial and you plug in c you are going to get the same result as taking k derivatives of your original function and plugging in c right the reason you have these factorials is that as you take derivatives right using the power rule right the first time you take the derivative n comes down in front then an n minus 1 then an n minus 2 and so on right until you've taken n derivatives and at that point you've got an n factorial out front that cancels with the n factorial here leaves you with the nth derivative at c all right by that time all the other terms are lower degrees so they've all disappeared when you take the derivative right and of course if you if you only take if you've taken fewer than n derivatives there's still going to be a an x minus c left in there so when you plug in x equals c you get a zero and those higher order terms they go away as well right so it works out so the idea here is that you want the derivatives of your polynomial to match the derivatives of your function and when you do that you find that the values of your polynomial agree very well with the values of your function at least over some interval right eventually they're going to diverge but over some interval they're going to agree right if you are in the context of looking at series right um we'll see later on that as you add more terms the approximation gets better and it gets better over a bigger interval so if you add infinitely many terms well maybe you actually get exact agreement everywhere right that's the goal of taylor series which you're going to see one last note is that if you put c equal to zero you get what are called um maclaurin polynomials okay so frequently in a lot of problems you'll be working with maclaurin polynomials just because they're simpler right instead of bringing in powers of say x minus 2 or x minus 3 or something like that you just work in powers of x right so maclaurin polynomials are going to look like you know f of 0 f prime of 0 times x f double prime of 0 over 2 times x squared and so on right so you deal with powers of x and they're they're a little bit simpler okay so that's how we define taylor polynomials it's time to look at some examples where we try to compute these and see how this example works in practice all right let's start with an example here kind of a standard relatively simple example um computing taylor polynomials and we'll hope that this example illustrates a couple of things one how the process works how you come up with the taylor polynomial how you sort of identify patterns and then generalize right um degree n right if we wanted like degree 100 we're not going to calculate 100 derivatives we want to figure out what's going on the other is is sort of the reason that we care about taylor polynomials sort of right and the point is that functions like the exponential function uh we we tend not to think about this these days because we have calculators and computers that will give us the values of these functions right for any x value that we want for any degree of accuracy that we want um we just get it out of a machine right but well one there's the question of how do the machines come up with those values right how are they programmed to compute these things uh you know and and how did people figure this out before they had calculators in computers right because people have been working with exponential functions for a very long time and well back in the day instead of calculators what people had were huge books full of tables of values um telling them you know if you wanted to know the value of e at 1.6 you could find you go through the book you'd look it up in the table and you would get the value right um this is what you had to do right and and how did people make those books how did they fill them out how they calculate them well they didn't have calculators available right so they had to do computations that could be done by hand polynomial calculations can be done by hand right we you know all is involved in in computing polynomials is powers products and sums right or differences right so it's all basic you know to compute a polynomial you need only basic arithmetic right and basic arithmetic in principle can be done by hand if you're patient enough all right so you imagine that maybe maybe you've learned all about the exponential function you know what its derivatives are and things like that you've but somehow you've made it this far in your calculus career without actually ever learning the value of e well let's see how you might come up with it so first we're going to try to compute the general degree n maclaurin polynomial right and so remember maclaurin means that we're doing a taylor polynomial with this c value set to zero right so f x is e to the x right f prime of x is e to the x f double prime of x is e to the x and well okay you get the idea right nothing happens when you take derivatives of the exponential function okay so f of zero is one f prime of zero is one f double prime of zero is one right in fact all the derivatives of the exponential function are equal to one at zero okay so our maclaurin polynomial p n we know that the definition looks like this f of zero plus f prime of zero times x plus f double prime of zero over two factorial times x squared uh you know what let's go to f triple prime for good measure why not f triple prime at zero over three factorial times x cubed and so on down to that last derivative over n factorial times x to the n but now we know all these derivatives are just one so what we get is one plus x plus x squared over 2 factorial plus x cubed over 3 factorial and so on down to x to the n over n factorial right which is a fairly nice simple pattern easy enough to follow right if you want you could use summation notation right and write this as x to the k over k factorial those of you who are looking at sequences in series let n go to infinity here and what you will have is actually a series representation for the exponential function and what we're going to see is that's actually valid for all real numbers um so replace that n by infinity and this is e to the x exactly equal to e to the x but if you truncate if you stop at some point you only have an approximation of e to the x right so the idea is the more terms you add the better the approximation gets right and the closer you state is zero the better your approximation will be okay so how do we approximate e well what is e e is f of one okay now it says use p5 okay so how is that going to work so what that means is we want to say that e is f of 1 and you know the whole point of these taylor polynomials is they're supposed to approximate the original function so f of 1 should be approximately p5 of 1 right and this approximation should in theory be better than the linear approximation okay so what's p5 at 1 well we go up to degree 5 we set x equal to 1 so that's a 1 that's a 1 that's a one the next so we have one plus a half plus one over three factorial plus one over four factorial plus 1 over 5 factorial if you want to work those out you get up to there okay and if you want to go a little bit further you can get everything all over a common denominator 120 plus 60 plus 20 plus 5 plus 1 over 120 okay so 180 200 206 is that right probably did something wrong a good chance i did something wrong but so we get we had something like this right um yeah okay um and then we say okay what is that approximately here's where i think this is wrong because i think that's less than two right and then what we should be getting here is two point so that the decimal value should be 2.71 667 something like that um which is why i think i made a mistake um ignore this part i've done something wrong there that part's fine okay so we get this value 2.7 something which is pretty good the calculator value if you ask the calculator to give you e up to up to four four four or five decimal places what you're gonna get is and again it's only approximate because it goes on forever um but you get like 2.71818 i think is how e starts okay um so so this approximation is is pretty good right first two decimal places are accurate we're off by two in the third decimal place and and if we added more terms well our approximation would would keep getting better and better oh ha i know what's wrong i fixed it what did i miss one plus one i'm not wrong i just have to add in a term so that's not 206 it's 326. divide by 120 and yeah that gives you that 2.7 okay so as a means of approximation it's pretty good what we still have to do is we have to figure out whether we can get some idea of a quantifying this approximation do we know ahead of time if we don't know that value do i know whether or not that's a good approximation we need some means of testing right that's going to come later let's do another example this time we're going to go with a slightly more complicated function right um we did the exponential function last time so maybe a little bit too easy because you know we don't have to do any work to compute the derivatives i've done the first four derivatives here just to get us started right and obviously there's a little bit more work involved than there was for the exponential function but we might also notice that these derivatives if we're looking carefully they follow a bit of a pattern right so we look and we see what kind of patterns can we see ignoring the first one let's look down here we notice that we have positive negative positive negative right the signs alternate and you can kind of see that the signs are going to keep alternating because the minus signs are coming from these exponents coming down from the power rule right so every time the exponent comes down we're going to get another minus sign because the exponent's getting more and more and more negative right also every time we take a derivative we're multiplying by the next biggest number right so when we get to the fifth derivative we're gonna multiply by minus four so the minus sign goes away and now we have two times three times four which is four factorial right three factorial two factorial one factorial so this is this kind of idea of you're looking for these patterns right you so and you might have to sit and think about this for a while but eventually you work out that okay once i've done k derivatives okay well i'm going to have an x to the minus k right minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4. and we have that factorial in front okay but it's one less than the exponent right k minus 1 factorial with a k there right it's always one less but there's one thing missing right what's missing i'm missing a sine factor how do i account for that sine factor well the standard way we do this is we use powers of minus one right an even power of minus one we're multiplying by one and even number of times gonna be positive odd number of times negative okay so we say okay can we just do minus 1 to the k multiply by minus 1 k times well we look at this we say that doesn't quite work right because look it's positive here when k is odd it's negative here when k is even right and that's going to give me the wrong sign so i could put another minus sign out front or we just shift this exponent either add or subtract 1. it doesn't really matter but maybe you like this to match that k minus 1 factorial so we put the k minus 1 out front okay and now that means that when we put x equal to 1 okay let's just do this for now put the denominator in soon we've got minus 1 to the k minus 1 times k minus 1 factorial times 1 to the minus k and of course 1 to any power is just 1. so what we have here is just minus 1 to the k minus 1. times k minus 1 factorial okay but we know that when we when we set up our taylor polynomial we're going to divide by k factorial right so if we do k derivatives evaluate at one divided by k factorial we've got 1 to the k minus 1 k minus 1 factorial over factorial okay now that simplifies right think about what you've got there k minus 1 factorial over k factorial this is 1 times 2 times three and so on up to k minus one on the bottom is one times two times three and so on up to k minus one and then times k right so pretty much everything cancels right 2's cancel the 3's cancel the 4's cancel the k minus 1's cancel all you're left with here is 1 over k so what we get is minus 1 to the k minus 1 over k right and of course you could also you know if you didn't see that you can do it by plugging in x equals one look at the pattern for for f for the derivatives evaluated at one and then go from there okay so that means that our degree n taylor polynomial is going to look like this now remember that because we're doing this at 1 we're not going to expand in powers of x like we did for the maclaurin polynomial we're going to expand in powers of x minus 1. okay so um f of one what's f f of one is zero right log of one is zero so we start with zero plus um f prime is one times x minus 1 f double prime minus 1 times x minus 1 squared right then plus one oh sorry one half there right minus one from here but then we had to divide by the by the two factorial so minus one over two right and then 1 3 right because we have that 2 factorial over 3 factorial leaves me with the 1 3 x minus 1 cubed and so on all right minus 1 to the k minus 1 over k times x minus 1 to the k there's your degree and taylor polynomial okay so now p6 in particular right if i wanted to approximate the natural log of 1.5 right i would say okay so p6 at 1.5 is going to be well it's going to be 1 times so 1.5 minus 1 is a half minus a half times a half squared plus a third times a half cubed minus a quarter times a half to the fourth plus a fifth times a half to the fifth minus a sixth times a half to the sixth okay now if you actually work that fraction out and you simplify you get it over a common denominator what you get is 259 over 6 40 or approximately what is it going to be i wrote it down over there 0.40 and if you compare the the actual value for the natural log of 1.5 if you look it up using your your calculator you're going to get 0.4055 not bad accurate to two decimal places we're only off by one in the third decimal place seems okay all right now um if you go ahead and you calculate um p6 at two well then those powers of onehalf they disappear right you're just gonna have one it's just gonna be one because we're gonna do powers of one right two minus one just gives me one so we get that okay and so this works out to 37 over 60 or approximately 0.6167 okay and you might hope that hey we're going to we're going to get this great approximation again but this time well the best we do is the first decimal place okay the actual value 6931 actually i guess if you round you don't even have the first decimal place all right um so that's not very good right so again we see that even even once you go to like a higher degree polynomial it might still happen that as your delta x grows right as the change in x grows the error in using these to approximate it's going to grow with the size of delta x and depending on the function it might grow faster or slower for the exponential function it's actually not that bad as you add more and more terms your approximation gets pretty good pretty fast the natural log it turns out and we'll we'll see this if we look at some other some other sort of analysis techniques the natural log takes a really really really long time um to give you a good approximation once you go out to two or further out even if we went to like 100 terms we still wouldn't be all that satisfied with our approximation so things really depend on the function for these taylor polynomial approximations in this next example we're just going to compute a couple of maclaurin polynomials the point of this example is is to illustrate something that's going to be useful for you if you are going to use a lot of taylor polynomials and especially if you're doing taylor series one of the things that comes up is you need ways to kind of do these things efficiently right you can't be sitting there all day taking derivative after derivative after derivative until you spot a pattern right these things they tend to get pretty messy and so far we've only looked at relatively simple functions right once the functions get more complicated maybe the pattern doesn't emerge right away and maybe the derivatives get really messy really fast are there other techniques that you can use turns out yes you're going to see some of those once you learn how to you know manipulate series taking derivatives and antiderivatives of series there are some tricks that you can do there right if you're seeing this in calc 1 you don't have those tricks up your sleeves but there's still some basic things that you can notice if you start playing around with some of these examples like this one here so for part a well we don't know what's going on with the sine functions so we just start taking derivatives and we see what happens right so f of x is sine f prime of x is is cos f double prime is negative sine the third derivative is negative cosine and once we get the fourth derivative right where we're back where we started all right so not as simple as the exponential function but there's still a pattern right cycle repeats every four derivatives right so once you know how to do you know up to p3 you kind of have some idea of how it's going to go from there right so we start computing f of zero is zero f prime of zero cosine of zero is one okay f double prime of zero is 0 again f triple prime of 0 is minus 1. okay and from there the pattern is going to repeat right so the coefficients are always going to go 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 minus 1. so you know in fact if we wanted to we could say hey let's do the degree n maclaurin polynomial right and it's going to look like well maybe we say something like 2n plus 1 right because the even degree terms don't show up the coefficient is 0. so what we're going to get is something that looks like x right 1 times x minus so there's no x squared term so the next term is going to be x cubed over 3 factorial there's no degree 4 term all right so the next one is x to the 5 right so the next derivative is going to be cosine again which is derivative is 1 over 5 factorial so you have x to the 5 over 5 factorial right and if we wanted degree 5 we're done otherwise going to 7 and why not there's 7 factorial and what does this look like you know at the end so if we think of this in terms of you know n this is 2 times 0 plus 1 degree 1 2 times one plus one two times two plus one two times three plus one right so in general we get an x to the 2 times n plus 1 over 2 n plus 1 factorial and what about the signs um plus signs for 0 2 next would be 4 and so on minus signs for 1 3 next would be 5. so plus signs when n is even minus signs when n is odd so we should have a minus 1 to the n out front okay well that's not so bad now degree 10 maclaurin polynomial for sine of x squared right so this gets a little bit trickier because now we've got chain rule with the derivatives and i need 10 of them all right and of course the point of this exercise is for us to realize at the end that we didn't have to do this but you've got to do it once before you before you realize that okay so 2x cos x squared right second derivative okay product rule now 2 cos x squared all right and then minus so we've got to do uh 4 x squared sine x squared right derivative of cos becomes negative sine x squared on the inside multiply by the derivative 2x times the 2x that's already there all right okay and by now you're probably getting concerned that i said i wanted to go all the way to 10 derivatives let's let's do a couple more okay derivative of cos is negative sign right 2x is going to come up minus 4x sine x squared okay minus 8x sine x squared so i guess let's just combine let's try to speed things up here 12x and then 4x squared times the derivative of sine cos there's another 2x 8x cubed cos x squared okay fourth derivative we're going to get minus 12 sine of x squared huh okay minus 12x cos theta so minus 24 x squared i want another 24 so actually 48 x squared cos x squared okay and then derivative cos is negative sine minus minus plus 16x to the four you tired of this yet i'm tired of this should we keep going maybe one more i don't know if i even want to do one more yeah let's do two more okay um minus 12 derivative sign is cos with a 2x so minus 24x x squared um plus okay a whole bunch of other stuff that i'm not going to do all right but it's all going to have x's in it and x is going to be set to zero right we're doing maclaurin i just want to point out that the next one g6 is going to have minus 24 cos x squared in it and some other stuff okay so g of 0 is 0. g prime of 0 0 g double prime of 0 i get something i get 2. g triple prime is 0 4th derivative 0 5th derivative 0 the sixth derivative is minus 24 okay which happens to be minus 4 factorial not that you were keeping score um okay i'll i'll i'll tell you what's going to happen next uh the seventh derivative and the eighth derivative and the ninth derivatives if you if you care to keep going they're all going to be zero the tenth derivative it won't be zero okay the tenth derivative well it's going to give us a number um we got to figure it out but we're not going to go all that way let me just tell you what happens because this is already kind of we're pushing 10 minutes here um what we're going to get for my p5 and x okay it's going to be so the first nonzero thing is here two so two over two factorial those cancel right two over two factorial times x squared i get x squared the next one is here at six minus four factorial over 6 factorial okay times x to the sixth now the next term i'm going to get is going to be as we said there's going to be an x to the 10 okay should be dividing by 10 factorial right but what we're going to find is that in the end there's only five factorial left over okay so what you actually get for x to the 10 here it turns out what you're going to get is it's going to be 10 factorial divided by 5 factorial is is the number that's going to come out um okay does that work yeah yeah okay um so and so the point of this is four factorial of two factorial um that that should simplify right uh yeah let me make sure i got this right yeah should be should just leave with a six i might have made some mistakes here what you should get is you replace x by x squared everywhere so you get x squared and then you get 1 over 3 factorial so this should be a 5 factorial times x squared cubed plus 1 over 5 factorial times x squared to the fifth and so on and so actually all you have to do is replace x by x squared and the one that you already have and you get the next one along the way okay um i've almost certainly made some calculation errors here not surprising given what i'm dealing with right it's it's a bit of a mess um you can sort of see how this might happen but you should end up with something that looks like that right so you can kind of you start playing around you start learning these tricks um you can plug one thing into another sometimes doesn't always work out but you definitely do not want to sit down and calculate 10 derivatives of this of sine of x squared using using the chain rule that's going to be a terrible mess right um if you see something like that you have to guess that probably there was a better way to do it all right so we've been looking at taylor polynomials and we've looked at a number of examples which have suggested that going beyond the linear approximation for your function at a given point c to higher order polynomial approximations gives you better results over a wider range of values right so remember that our taylor polynomial right looks like f of a plus f prime of a or sorry c we're doing c for our interval times x minus c there's the linear approximation right um plus these higher order terms right which all come by taking higher and higher order derivatives evaluating at that point c we divide by this factorial and we multiply by the corresponding power of x minus c okay and we've seen that there are some functions like for example trigonometric functions where these taylor polynomials actually approximate very well over a fairly wide range of values there are other functions like natural logarithm where these don't work as well as you might like right over a small range of interval a small range of values not too bad but there's always a point where you move just a little bit further away and and suddenly the approximation is terrible and it doesn't matter how many terms you add to your taylor polynomial it doesn't really seem to improve all that much okay so what the next step here is is once you've established your approximation you want to know how good your approximation is right and and keep in mind that you might be doing this in some scenario where you don't necessarily know how to compute the function exactly right because we have graphing calculators and computers and things that give us quite precise values for these functions we sort of sometimes fail to appreciate why something like taylor's theorem is useful taylor's theorem is useful because you might be in a scenario where you don't actually know how to compute the function precisely but you can compute tailored polynomials right or some other kind of approximation for your function and let's say you want to know the value of your function accurate up to let's say six decimal places because that's what you're going to display well then you need to be able to figure out how many terms do you need to put in your polynomial to give the value accurate to six decimal places at a particular point right so at a particular value of x how big does n have to be before i know i've got six decimal places right so you might need to solve these problems taylor's theorem gives you one means of doing so okay so taylor's theorem says that as long as you've got enough continuous derivatives right so if you want to use a degree n taylor polynomial you need this derivative but you also need the next one okay you need n plus one continuous derivatives as long as you've got enough continuous derivatives you can write your function as the taylor polynomial plus a remainder right so notice it's equals here it's not an approximation it's equals right this remainder right this should be thought of here as sort of your error term right it's telling you you know the difference right if i move this if i subtract that over it's giving you the difference between the original function and the taylor polynomial right so typically what we're interested in here is we're interested in actually the absolute value of this remainder right and then often at a particular point where we're where we're evaluating things um and so if you're looking at this you realize that okay well this is just a constant i don't need to worry about that right there there is there's a couple of things here that you have to watch out for um well i mean you have this term but actually this it's it's not as as as difficult to deal with as you might think because for whatever problem you're doing with you've chosen c in advance right you choose the point where you're centering your taylor polynomial and now we're trying to decide for a given x how good is our approximation so we've chosen our x uh the only other wild card here is this t right um now this particular remainder here this is what's called the lagrange form of the remainder it's one of actually there's like often three different forms that you find for this remainder three different remainder formulas um the first one is is derived using sort of integration arguments and it's quite tricky to get to but once you have that first one then there are sort of mean value theorem arguments that you can make to arrive at simpler remainder formulas and so this t here all we know about t is that it's in this interval that we're working on actually you can you can say a little bit more it's it's between if you want to narrow it down it's between x and c it's somewhere in between those two values right but typical mean value theorem argument you know that this number exists but you don't know what it is right all you know that it exists you know roughly where it's located but you don't know it exactly so what you're doing with taylor's theorem is you're not trying to compute this error this remainder term exactly because of course if you could do it exactly you would know the exact value that's not the point the point is to get some measure of how big this thing can get right when you're dealing with error when you're trying to estimate error right you want a maximum error you want an upper bound right so you want to be able to say look i know that my answer is off by a certain amount and i know that that amount can't be any bigger than this right if it turns out that your error is actually less than what you budgeted for nobody's going to complain right you did better than you than you advertised right you're only going to be in trouble if you advertise that you can do things within a certain error and then it turns out that you're you're much higher than that then you're going to get yourself in trouble so typically what you want to do here is you want to look for what is the biggest value that i can get for this function and we want to look i guess that absolute value right absolute value of this derivative okay and we take that absolute value you know over this interval i we divide by n plus 1 factorial and we multiply by the absolute value of x minus c taken to the n plus first power all right so there's a few things that you realize with this one is that if x is fairly close to c and in particular if the difference between x and c is less than one then this is going to get smaller as n gets bigger right so just being within one of the center of your polynomial is is going to give you some control over this remainder right so staying within a distance of 1 is going to work that's why we saw with like the natural logarithm as long as long as you know we did the log natural log we did the taylor polynomial centered at one and between zero and two we did okay but once we went past two once that difference was bigger than one we had a really bad estimate it wasn't good anymore okay because as soon as this difference is bigger than one it's going to start growing with n right of course it's not going to grow as fast as this factorial so what you're looking for is you're looking for you know making sure that overall this thing is getting smaller than gets bigger and indeed it will right for pretty much any reasonably behaved function is going to get smaller than gets bigger right if you're if you're looking at this in the context of sequences in series right your taylor series is going to have some radius of convergence and as long as you stay within that radius you know that this remainder is going to go to 0 as n goes to infinity okay but if you're just working with polynomials you're doing polynomial approximations then you don't care that it's going to eventually go to infinity right like if if you have to go out to like you know billions or trillions before you start getting a small enough value that's not very practical if you're using this to approximate functions right you want to know that by the time you get to like n equals 10 or 20 this remainder is small enough right you want things to get small relatively quickly otherwise you might be relying on a lot more computational power than you want okay so we're gonna see how this formula is used in the next few videos so we'll do a couple of examples um and then we're gonna move on to the next topic all right so let's look at an example we we looked at this example earlier the the natural logarithm we we use this degree 6 taylor polynomial to approximate the values of you know so we did this for the natural log of 1.5 and we did it for the natural log of 2. and we found that the approximation was not too bad for 1.5 it wasn't very good at all for natural log of 2 right so now we want to kind of look into this remainder and try to understand what's going on so if we were to calculate the seventh derivative of x you would find that you get minus 6 factorial over x to the 7. okay and if we want to center at 1 right we probably want to use we need an interval that contains the center and it needs to contain the point that we want to evaluate so maybe we move like 0.1 either side right so maybe we go like 0.9 to 1.6 right and you could you know in in effect if you wanted to you could probably go with the interval from 1 to 1.5 because this value of t in the remainder formula that you get from taylor's theorem generally it's safe to assume that it's somewhere in between these two values so somewhere between 1 and 1.5 but uh let's go with 0.9 let's see where that gets us right let's let's like is it you know if if we get an error estimate that's too big that's all right that just means we're being a little bit more conservative right that's better than than trying to come up with an error estimate that's smaller so you make yourself look good but then it turns out that maybe you had a bit too small and your error estimate is not actually as accurate as you thought okay so if we if we use this interval and we want the maximum of the absolute value of the seventh derivative for for t in this interval let's call it i right we say well i want to make this thing as big as possible for t in this interval and well x is in the denominator right so if we if we have some reciprocal power of x and we want to make this thing big we should take x as small as possible uh that means we should take x to be 0.9 all right we're taking absolute value so we lose the minus sign so we have 6 factorial over 0.9 to the 7. and if you put that through your calculator you find that this comes out to be about 1506 okay all right if you um if you decided that you wanted to do just t equals 1 right if we went from 1 to 1.5 you'd get 720 which is 6 factorial right so our estimate here is about twice as big all right you think 0.9 is pretty close to one right but once you raise it to a high enough power it definitely has an effect okay so we have this this maximum and so now we know that um if we're if we're interested in the error right our error is going to be well it's going to be given by the remainder at 1.5 and we want the absolute value so we take the absolute value and that remainder is going to be less than or equal to so we have this maximum here and we've just worked out that you know the biggest that we can get on the interval we've chosen is 1506 we divide by 7 factorial and we should actually put in this is our 6 right our 6. so for n equal to 6 we divide by 7 factorial okay and then x minus c c is 1 x is 1.5 1.5 minus 1 gives us 0.5 or one half raised to the seventh power right so that 0.5 to the seventh power that's going to help make sure the error is not too big here right because you know that's that's one over two to the seventh that's getting to a reasonably small number that's one over a thousand right so we get to here and again you can punch this into your calculator by the way for when you're doing these error estimates it's nice to have a you know a decent calculator or even a spreadsheet handy to run the numbers right often in some situations you're plugging in various values of n to figure out which one works and so it's nice to be able to just generate them all and use a spreadsheet something like that so if you punch this through you get that this is something like 0.002 3 right and so what that tells you is that the estimate you get for the natural log of 1.5 right because the error is less than 5 in this spot you know that you're good to two decimal places right because whatever value you got you know you get up to the second decimal place in the third decimal place you're off by you know plus or minus 0.2 um up to rounding that's not enough to shift what you've got in the second decimal place so you're you're fairly happy with that right now if we had gone with the natural log of 2 instead right so then maybe we're going with 0.9 up to maybe 2.1 something like that well actually the only thing that changes the minimum is still going to be down here 0 or the maximum value is still going to be down here 0.9 right so you're still going to have that that 1506 over 7 factorial there but now your x minus c is going to be 2 minus 1. it's 1 to the 7th power right and and so that that this doesn't contribute right it's just 1 to the 7th so that's not going to help shrink the remainder the only thing that really helps shrink the remainder here is that 7 factorial right and you can see that this is this is not going to be very good at all right so 7 factorial is is what like um so seven times it's around five thousand right um so so this is yeah this is around fifteen hundred over five thousand something like that right um so it's less than one but it's bigger than point one so it's it's it's not as good right it's certainly not as good anymore i guess it's three thousand over over ten thousand so uh you know so somewhere around zero point three right which tells you that your answer is you don't necessarily even have the first decimal place right you've got the ones digit okay but that's about it so so here's where you can you can see that this is this is not going to help right and roughly roughly if you kind of play around with this if you think of where this came from right if you go to a higher degree what you're going to have is is the remainder is going to be more or less that that 0.9 factor if you want right you can creep closer to one if you want to kind of get it a bit better but but then even even even if you went with even if you went with one with with t equal to one your best case is going to be still n factorial over n plus 1 factorial which is which is 1 over n plus 1 right so that tells you that you know to get even the first decimal place you're going to need like 10 terms to get the second decimal place you're going to need like 100 terms right three decimal places you need like a thousand terms um so if you're trying to approximate you know log of two this is probably not how you want to do it all right let's look at another example now this is one that you probably shouldn't try to do by hand chances are you want to have a the very least scientific calculator with you even better would be a spreadsheet i'll try to explain why as we get there okay so the the goal here is we want to approximate the cosine function with the maclaurin polynomial and we want to figure out what is the smallest degree that we need if we want to make sure that our approximation it has a certain degree of accuracy when we are approximating cosine of two right so we know that our maclaurin polynomial for cos okay if you work through this example it looks something like this 1 minus x squared over 2 factorial x to the 4 or 4 factorial x to the 6 over 6 factorial x to the 8th over 8 factorial x to the 10 over 10 factorial and so on up to up to whatever you know depending on the degree how far you want to go okay so so that's what the co the taylor polynomial for cosine looks like maclaurin polynomial we're centering at zero we want to figure out how many of these terms do we need to include to get this degree of accuracy right so cos of 2 we'd approximate with pn of 2 so we'd approximate with 1 minus 4 over 2 factorial plus 16 over 4 factorial right minus 64 over 6 factorial and so on we want to try and approximate this so again we rely on taylor's theorem and we say okay i know that that by taylor's theorem i know that the remainder is always going to be less than or equal to this maximum value for the n plus first derivative at some t over n plus 1 factorial right and then this is just simply going to be absolute value of x to the n right because we're we're centering at zero so x minus c just becomes x all right now one of the things that that we know here right is is we know what these derivatives are now of course it depends on n but we know that these these derivatives they cycle right we're going to take the first derivative we get negative sign then negative cos then positive sign then positive cos and then repeat right so every every four derivatives it repeats so we know um well the absolute value eats that plus or minus right so this is either going to be cos t or sine t once you take the absolute value okay and and i haven't written down an interval here i guess we go with something like you know from minus 0.1 up to 2.1 something like that but it doesn't matter because we know that what do we know about these trig functions we know that the absolute value of cos is always less than or equal to one and we know that the same thing is true for sine right it doesn't matter what t is these can never be bigger than one this is the property of sine and cosine functions so that means that regardless of the inter interval that we're working on this maximum can't be bigger than one so the remainder if we're doing this at 2 has to be less than or equal to 1 over n plus 1 factorial times 2 oops sorry to the n plus 1. okay and and now the rest is kind of trial and error computational work plugging in values of n until you find the first n that gives you a small enough value right we want it to be less than 0.001 this is where a spreadsheet is really great because all you do is you take one column and you label it n and you have another column that you label i don't know rn or error or something right and you just fill the values down in fact i think if you put one and you drag it will fill the rest in automatically on a decent spreadsheet right and and then the rn you say okay so what is what is rn you can you can kind of program this into your spreadsheet right you say it's going to be 2 to the power of you know so if this is if this is in like cell maybe this is like a two here right so you're like you're like okay so it's going to be 2 to the power of of a2 divide by um oh plus one right because we add one to the exponent divide by like factorial a2 plus one and then you just copy it down right and when you copy in the spreadsheet it's going to increment this as you copy it down and that's just going to do those calculations for you automatically so you don't have to do it it's great right but of course you can you can do these right you can start working them out so when n is equal to one you get 2 squared over 2 factorial 4 over 2 you get 2 well that's definitely not going to work so you go to n equals 2 2 cubed or 3 factorial 8 over six four thirds uh it's about one point three ish still too big you go to n a equals three two to the four sixteen over four factorial just twenty four that's three quarters so you're at you're at 0.75 right and and you keep you keep working your way down you keep doing these so you go okay n equals 4 uh 32 over over 5 factorial so 32 over over 120 and and you get this is about 0.267 right and then you go to 5 so 5 plus 1 is 6. 64 over 6 factorial so 64 over 720 and you get something like i've got them written then it was written down over there i don't remember these this is now 0.084 getting better right so you keep going for n equals six point zero two five right um six plus one you get two to the seven so we're at like 128 seven factorial is getting you know reading there is like 5040 right but still okay and and now one of the things that you'll notice as you play around these examples is factorials they grow much faster than exponentials right because here you're just multiplying by two each time here the next thing you multiply is bigger than the previous thing all right so you keep going and the next one you get you're doing like 256 divided by like 40 000 and something and you get 0.0 and then you try eight and you got 512 for your for your two to the nine and then you're dividing by nine factorial which is like 362 000 something and you get 0.0014 almost there but not quite right so you say oh we got to go to 9. so we got n equals 9 and for n equals 9 right you get 2 to the 10 over 10 factorial okay so so 2 to the 10 is like is is a thousand thousand twenty four ten factorial is i don't know it's like three three million something right three million in something and and and you do get something which is indeed less than 0.01 so you're like yes i guess i got to go to degree 9. but that's not quite the end of the story because hey here's our here's our polynomial right um the coefficient of x to the nine in the maclaurin polynomial for cos is zero okay so right i can actually stop at eight because the degree nine maclaurin polynomial is the same as the degree 8 maclaurin polynomial right because when you go to degree 9 you're adding 0. nothing changes so in fact um n equals eight will do right and and then maybe you're concerned you're like hey but you know this number was too big like that doesn't make sense how can how can you know we get this much smaller number for n equals 9 than we have here but they're the same polynomial like shouldn't the error be the same and of course the error is the same because remember we don't know this value precisely we're always just going for the worst case scenario was the biggest that it could be right these numbers here are bigger than the actual error right so typically once you get something that's close to the area you're looking for because you're overestimating you're probably already good at n equals eight but sometimes you add one more term just to be safe
