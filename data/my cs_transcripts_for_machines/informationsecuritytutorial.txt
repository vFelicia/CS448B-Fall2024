i'm dr mike murphy i earned my phd in computer science from clemson university and i teach computer science and information systems at coastal carolina university located in conway south carolina in this lecture i'm going to introduce basic security principles and begin discussing information system security i'm going to begin by defining what we mean by security discuss how security from the physical world evolved into the information world talk about something called the cia triad which establishes the principles of information security that we typically use for evaluating systems and then talk about some of the fundamental limitations and tradeoffs between both security and functionality and between principles in the cia triad so what do we mean by security this is something of a challenging question because we all have an intuitive concept of what it means to be secure but it's sometimes difficult to formalize this concept into something that we can study and something that we can evaluate for example we feel secure locked inside our own houses or perhaps locked inside our own vehicles but what exactly are we protecting ourselves against what exactly makes us secure versus not secure we look back through history we can see many examples of mankind's quest to build secure environments in which to live in which to work or to guard assets to guard entries into areas and so forth in this photograph for example we can see out here the island fort known as fort sumter which guarded the entrance to charleston harbor in south carolina and provided a secure barrier equipped with cannons to attempt to deter enemy ships from sailing into the harbor now this photograph was taken from fort moultrie which sits at the sites of one of the earliest forts securing charleston harbor and fort moultrie went through several renovations including an early to mid 20th century renovation where it was equipped with more modern weaponry again to guard the harbor against unauthorized shipping that might enter or invasion from a foreign force so a simple definition of security is protection protection from harm this basic idea is as old as society itself the idea of being protected from an attack the idea that we can have some kind of resistance to theft malicious injury and other harms that might befall us in the most basic form we're discussing physical security keeping out those who would do us harm and for many thousands of years physical security was the only concern that we really had we didn't have information processing systems to worry about so physical security really focuses on protection of assets or people from intruders or other types of malicious entities that might attempt to gain access now we can also extend this definition a little bit to say protection from the elements protection from natural forces wind or rain or flooding but for simplicity we're going to focus for the moment on intruders and the focus physical security is typically about building walls about excluding access to different resources or different areas by unauthorized parties here for example is a wall on fort moultrie on sullivan's island and this wall is designed for several purposes one of which is that if someone is invading by land it would be difficult to scale this wall it would provide a means to slow down an invader and thereby have an atta have a chance to launch a counter attack now this wall also directly faces the ocean and can be used as a bit of a sea wall during storms and hurricanes but the principle is the same we're trying to keep out unauthorized parties whether those be other people or water so that makes sense we have physical security protecting ourselves from harm what about information systems what happens when we take a bunch of computer systems bunch of information processing systems databases different servers business applications what happens when we have these types of applications we do have a physical security component in the sense that we don't want someone breaking in and stealing the physical server but we also have some additional issues because the path to be able to get into a server is not purely a physical one there's also an electronic information driven pathway usually the internet or system connected to a network that would enable someone to have access to a server for example and in many cases we want to provide access to these resources remotely to users we want to restrict that access to legitimate users so we need to extend our definition of protection from harm in order to apply to these different information systems and we typically think about three main categories of harm that could befall an information system the first of these is theft of information a lot of information processing systems contain personal information corporate secrets and other types of data that we don't want unauthorized people having access to if this information is stolen for example it could be used to launch identity theft or to have insights into a company's next product and possibly even steal a company's idea before they have a chance to develop that product we're also concerned about alteration of information this could be as simple as someone breaking in and defacing a website or it could be as complex as someone going in altering database records to cover up fraud or other types of financial crimes we also concern ourselves with denial of service or dos this is when systems are attacked in such a way that they are busy responding to the attackers and they in fact become so busy responding to the attackers that they can no longer provide service to their legitimate users so secure systems must guard against these problems they must ensure that confidential data remain confidential that the data are not changed by unauthorized users or changed by authorized users acting in malicious ways with malicious intent such as someone inside the company trying to steal information or trying to commit fraud and the systems must remain operational reachable and functional or collectively we say available for legitimate users so availability we're concerned about the system being up and running being accessible and functioning correctly for the users who are authorized to use that system these three principles form what's called the cia triad in security and that stands for confidentiality integrity and availability in an information system we are especially concerned with these three things we're concerned with ensuring the confidentiality of the system where the data on that system the integrity of the data and the system itself as well as the availability of that system to legitimate users we don't mind denying availability to illegitimate users we want to maintain availability for legitimate users so confidentiality let's start with the first principle in the cia triad this is the principle of protecting data from unauthorized access or disclosure as i mentioned before there are some types of data that are used in business that are used in industry that are used in government that are sensitive social security numbers for example can be used to facilitate identity theft medical records are considered to be confidential in order to protect a person's privacy in terms of the types of illnesses they've had to deal with the types of medical histories that they have corporate secrets so secrets about upcoming products products under development pricing models things such as even the margins or the amount of profit that a company makes on a particular product we also have military intelligence what kind of information has the military gathered we might want to keep that information secret in order to protect operatives in the field as well as to avoid embarrassment or tipping off an enemy that we might know some information about them there are some attackers who focus on trying to steal sensitive information folks involved with identity theft for example whether it be persons committing identity theft or reselling information to other people who commit identity theft are an issue in addition some folks will try to steal sensitive corporate information and sell that to other companies that are attempting to gain an advantage over the victim corporation the second principle of the cia triad integrity is the principle of ensuring that unauthorized or undetected changes to data or system configurations do not occur there are types of attacks that attempt to alter records or falsify information often in furtherance of other criminal activities such as fraud other attacks however attempt to take over servers entirely they might deface a content such as websites send unsolicited messages turn a server into a machine that's simply sending spam to everyone or distribute illegal content such as child pornography or copyrighted materials many other types of malicious uses can also be found for compromised systems and the third principle of the cia triad is that of availability and this is the principle of ensuring that systems stay online and the data and services provided by those systems remain accessible to authorized users some attackers attempt to disable corporate government or other systems in a bid to try to disrupt the operations of that entity this type of attack known as a denial of service attack is relatively common and occurs most often when servers are flooded with requests that prevent legitimate users from being served now we have these principles of the cia triad but it's important to understand that there are also some fundamental limitations that go along with our security principles for example one of the most fundamental if not the most fundamental tradeoff exists between security and functionality and this tradeoff works as follows if i implement a system that's extremely secure that has a very strict security policy it may not be truly available to legitimate users for example i could define a corporate security policy that says certain types of business information simply cannot be stored electronically they have to be stored in paper form or similarly that certain types of information can be stored electronically but cannot be stored in a database that can be queried by people in the company well if that information is central to the operation of the business the inability of employees to radically readily access that information could be detrimental to the business itself the opposite extreme if i have a highly functional system that pays no attention to security there's a high chance that that system will be compromised sooner or later and that could potentially have serious ramifications to the company both in terms of lost profits and in terms of liability and the potential of facing lawsuits which could a smaller company similarly there are tradeoffs between the principles in the cia triat if one designs a system and focuses on only one of the principles in the cia triad that system may not conform very well to the other principles in the cia triad for example a great way to secure a database system in terms of confidentiality is to unplug that system and store it in a vault somewhere in a bank where it can be physically secured it would be very difficult for someone to break in and steal information off that system unfortunately however it would also be impossible for authorized users to gain access to that system and that system would have zero availability the opposite extreme one can easily configure a server to provide high availability by simply allowing that server to let anyone who wants to use it access it and possibly change information on it however that high availability system will allow any information that saved on it to be easily accessed by anyone thereby compromising confidentiality and if the configuration of that system allows people to change the information on it easily that will compromise the integrity quite quickly so there are limitations to security and fundamental tradeoffs that have to be considered between the principles in the cia triad so to summarize our main goal with security is to provide protection from harm and in the context of information systems we're really focused on the principles of the cia triad confidentiality integrity and availability fundamental tradeoffs exist between security and functionality as well as between the principles of the cia triad there is no magic bullet to security and there is no simple product that we can simply buy to make a system immediately secure there are a number of tradeoffs that have to be considered there are a number of things that have to be thought about in order to design a system that attempts to maximize the principles on the cia triad including the availability to authorized users thank you for

computer science and information systems at coastal carolina university located in conway south carolina in this lecture i'm going to discuss threats vulnerabilities and controls and how these things apply to computer security i'm going to begin by defining each of these terms threats vulnerabilities controls along with a silly example of each and then talk about some of the tradeoffs involved in implementing controls recall from the introduction to security lecture the cia triad the stands for confidentiality integrity and availability these are the three principles to which we want a system to adhere in order for that system to be secure threats are possible dangers that could compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of a computer system or service threats could be malicious in other words they could be intentional threats such as someone trying to hack into the system or someone trying to damage the system or they could be accidental threats such as a power outage or a natural disaster these threats may be external in other words this could be an attacker coming over the internet and trying to attack a server or these could be internal threats this could be an employee involved in fraudulent activities such as money laundering or or theft or embezzlement or some type of activity like that so we could have external threats we can have internal threats and those threats could be malicious or those threats could simply be accidental in identifying a threat we want to ask ourselves how a system could be compromised in other words what are ways that the confidentiality integrity and or availability of the system could be reduced what are forces that can come and potentially damage these things remember that not all the threats are necessarily malicious and not all the threats are necessarily external it's possible to have an internal threat this could be a malicious internal threat such as a corrupt employee or it could be an accidental internal threat such as a problem with a circuit breaker in the building there's all kinds of different types of threats that have to be considered and not all of them are necessarily malicious not all of them are necessarily outside the company or outside the organization so i've come up with a really silly example and this is an incredibly silly example but it allows us to illustrate some of the issues at hand without having to worry about technical details so in this silly example i have a small object specifically a pen and my cat has this tendency of taking small objects like pens and kicking them off tables and turning them into toys and sometimes kicking them on the refrigerator or under the stove and when he does this of course with a small object i have to go and find the object in order to restore its availability to me it's also possible for the cat to chew on on objects like pens and so forth he doesn't really do that so much he does like to chew on paper though so we have a pen the cat can threaten the pen and the outcome of that threat could be denying the availability of the pen because it's been kicked up under the refrigerator so here we have the cat threatening the pen uh actually i think he was more interested in napping at this at this point but with a cat we have a pen there's our potential threat now the difference between a threat and vulnerability is that vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that permit a threat to be realized compromising the confidential integrity and or availability of the system so the threat is the potential harm that could come to the system or the potential force that could affect the system the vulnerability is the weakness in the system that allows that threat to get in and materialize a critical vulnerability is a flaw that can be exploited by an attacker with the correct tools or by the correct situation in other words this is a vulnerability that we know exists in the system we know there are tools to exploit the vulnerability and we know that all it takes is someone accessing that particular vulnerability with those particular tools to launch a successful attack so when we look to identify vulnerabilities we've identified threats what we need to do is we need to decide how those threats can potentially affect the system in other words what weaknesses are present in the system that enable that threat to materialize into some kind of dysfunction into some kind of theft of information into some kind of damage to the system or into some kind of denial of service situation some type of availability removal or reduction a subtle difference between vulnerabilities and threats okay threats give us sort of big picture things that could come in and potentially damage the system the vulnerability is an avenue that those threats can take in order to actually damage the system so subtle difference they are related but basically a vulnerability allows a threat to materialize so in our silly example perhaps this will make it a little bit clearer why is the cat able to threaten the pen okay we have the cat who wants to grab the pen take it kick it under the refrigerator that's the thread what makes the pen vulnerable to that thread well it's actually the pen's characteristics it's a small object it is a small and light object and the cat is much bigger than the pen the cat has the strength to move the pen the pen is about the right size and shape to be batted around with the paw and so the light weight of the pen allows the cat to manipulate it easily if the cat is able to reach the pen grab the pen kick it off a table and start batting it around the floor then that becomes a critical vulnerability because the pen is just sitting there it's readily accessible the cat can take it and turn it into a toy so you can see here we have the pen and the pen is not very large not very heavy compared to the cat and so it's actually the small size of this object relative to the cat that enables the cat to threaten it okay so if we have these threats and we have vulnerabilities to potential threats what measures can we take what steps can we take to try to mitigate those threats to try to close those vulnerabilities and the answer is we have what are called controls or security controls and these are safeguards that are implemented to close vulnerabilities and mitigate threats in order to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system so controls can be physical they can be procedural they can be technical a very simple control that you're probably using on a regular basis is simply locking a door locking the door to your house your apartment locking the door to your car that's a very simple physical control it denies access to someone simply opening the door and using very little effort to gain access we can also have procedural controls for example for example when handling money it is possible to have a procedure that says that two employees have to be present this way one employee has a harder time simply skimming some money out of the drawer skimming some money out of the safe in the security of information field or in computer security these controls can be technical we can have system policies in place that prevent certain actions we can require data to be encrypted so we have these different controls that we can implement in order to try to protect the system in order to identify controls we need to ask ourselves what kind of vulnerabilities there are to the types of threats that we've determined exist and how can those vulnerabilities be closed or how can we mitigate the threats what safeguards can we put in place to make the system less vulnerable to specific threat what types of protective measures can we take so let's take our silly example again there are a couple of ways that we could make the pen less vulnerable to the cat one way is that we could increase the size or weight of the pen so that the cat couldn't move it so we could make the pen four feet long and weigh 20 pounds and then the cat is not going to be able to move the pen that would be a way of directly closing the vulnerability unfortunately that choice would have some side effects it would be fairly difficult to write with a twenty pound four foot long pen we could secure the pen where the cat couldn't reach it so we could close the vulnerability by preventing its exploitation this is a fairly simple approach and it's one i'll talk about a little bit more in in a moment and it has certain benefits as long as it's implemented correctly another solution would be to
