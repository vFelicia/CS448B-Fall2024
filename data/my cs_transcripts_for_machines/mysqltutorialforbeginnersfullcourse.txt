hello this is John from cave of programming calm welcome to my my sequel course this is a course that takes you right from the absolute basics of my sequel all the way up to pretty advanced so hopefully whether you you're learning this from scratch and you just have some basic computing knowledge or whether you already know some my sequel and you want to improve your knowledge and maybe learn about transactions and store procedures and that sort of thing hopefully this is the course for you so in this introductory video I just want to talk a little bit about what my sequel actually is so my sequel it's technically it's a database management system although we often refer to it as just a database but really it's a database management system and it's is some software that can manage a collection of databases so sequel it is actually it actually stands for structured query language so structured query that's a very unhelpful spellcheck I've got here structured query language and sequel is the language that you use to issue commands to relational databases like my sequel so in the next video we're going to be look at what looking at what you have to download but if I search for my sequel downloads here and let's maybe check this page my sequel community downloads we're going to be installing the my sequel community server and we're also going to be installing something called the my sequel workbench and they're crossplatform I'm using a Mac but fine on Windows or Linux as well so why is it called a community server well a database is is actually a collection of tables so in a database you store data in tables at least this is true in a in a relational database like my sequel so my sequel is this database management system that manages a bunch of different bases each one you can give a name to and you can add tables to it and add data to those tables but the database management system needs some way of allowing you to communicate with it so what happens is it runs there's some software that runs continuously as what we call a server in fact if I look at my installation in my sequel I can see down here somewhere we've got a program called my sequel D and that's a program that's now running continuously on my system and it's a server which means that if I go to a URL let's go to localhost and a default URL is lope is the name and a machine that the server is running on and the port 3306 so via this URL we can communicate with the database if I actually go to it we don't get anything useful in my cases seems to have downloaded something that's because the server's is not producing data in a format that my browser my web browser understands it's it's producing data and accepting data in a format that's understood by what we call clients or my sequel clients that connect to this server which is a database management system so an example of a my sequel Klein would be that PHP myadmin program which you may be familiar with and we've also got another example of such a program right here it's the my sequel program so in here in my installation of my sequel is a program that's just called my sequel and that's a program that I can use on a commandline if I want to to connect to my running server my running database management system and I can use this program to issue commands to my sequel in a language called sequel structured query language now in this course we're going to be using a client called the my sequel workbench this is a really nice sort of fully featured tool that as we'll see it also allows you to design databases visually but one thing we can do is we can just connect and then we can see what databases we've got already so I've already created a date a bunch of databases at this point and we can use particular databases and we can see what tables are in those databases don't worry about memorizing these commands because we're going to see them as we go through the course and I can see what I can see what data is in these tables and this command is an example of sequel structured query language and we'll be looking at that in this course so in a nutshell we've got this program which is database management system it manages databases which are collections of tables containing data and it's also a server and the father is a server allows client programs like the my sequel workbench here to communicate with it and we can then issue commands using sequel structured query language ok so in the next video we'll look at what we have to install to get started with all this stuff my sequel is a great database to learn you can install it even on a you know a small old laptop it will run pretty well usually it's so it's relatively lightweight you can store make huge amounts of data in it as long as you've got disk space and enough memory to cope with all this software which most computers will have and because it's free because the Community Edition is free it's not restricted in any way and it's very powerful because of that probably in the majority of websites in the world use my sequel to store their data like it's something like a utility company or a bank is going to stump up a lot of hard cash for probably for Oracle and also for like life support with Oracle so something that's got to be ultra secure may not use my sequel but then again there's no reason probably why couldn't is it's just a matter of maybe getting some support with I recall that Oracle is just the established kind of big database in the field but my sequel is used for all kinds of things you know all kinds of needs for online applications if you want to make a social network or you know you want to just have a like a WordPress website or something that just stores data my sequel is that is a really good choice of database very very widely used okay so I'll shut up and we'll get on in the next video to actually installing some software here so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming comm in this tutorial we'll kind of look at what you need to install to get started with this tutorial so I'm in Google here and for reasons that I don't fully understand I've got a Hungarian version of Google but the first thing we need to install is the my sequel community server this is a free database which you can install and which will sort of enable you to create tables and store data in there and do all kinds of things like that so if you search for the my sequel community server just go to the download link and most of the time all you have to do is select your operating system download the right installer and just run it like any normal installation program let's just click this download link they do have this slightly sneaky thing where they try to get you to create an account but at the moment at least they also give you this no fence just stop my download option here so you can do that so download the version for your operating system and install it they have versions for for Linux for Windows I'm using Mac but you can install it on more or less any reasonable desktop computer if the installation program asks you to enter a password for your root user which is as we'll see later on this is the user that you'll be connecting us initially it's really important that you you remember the password that you entered it's very important but in my just not ask you this installation program used to be a bit flaky and a long time ago that didn't even used to be a program but now usually and that installers for the various platforms they pretty much work out the box if you do run into any problems then will make sure you are running the installer and not a zip download and don't be afraid to Google for further information if you have to I can't show you the installation for your platform because it depends on your platform and it even depends on the version of my sequel and the version of the installer but if you run into any problems don't be afraid to Google for that like can't install my sequel windows 7 or whatever and if any error messages come up don't be afraid to copy those them or just type them out paste them into Google do a search and see what comes up there because probably other people have encountered your problem as well if you have a problem if you really get stuck with this you can just search for online my sequel database something like that and you will find versions that you can use on the Internet and some of these are just meant for learning my sequel and others require you to create a account and maybe create a database with a few clicks and possibly even pay but you can find various free versions on here that you can use to practice your sequel if you really run into problems now in this tutorial we'll focus on using the my sequel workbench which is another free tool so you also need to install that for your system search for my sequel workbench and go to that and install that so again all the same things apply it's probably going to install pretty smoothly if you run into any problems don't be afraid to Google if you if you wanna use an online my sequel database instead should be no problem because we won't be getting to tie it up with the workbench here I'm going to focus on learning my sequel of the sort that you'd also type on a command line if you wanted to but this is a really handy tool to have because it just makes it much easier and nicer to work with my sequel database when you've installed it you you will well you probably have a choice between running the my sequel server when you when your operating system starts up when your computer starts which is the easiest option that's gonna run your app your database itself when it starts and then you can start the my sequel workbench to connect to it or you cannot to start it and via some kind of tool that they supply you with so for example in my Mac here if I go to my Mac system preferences I've got this my sequel administration tool in there so I'm gonna now that I've installed this I've installed my sequel I can click start my sequel server and I've just got a enter my operating system password to start that usually again it will start up pretty smoothly might also want to restart your computer if you have any problems and then when you've done that you should be able to run the my sequel workbench let's try to run that and you should be able to open a connection so this is how it looks at the moment it does change from version to version but you should be able to figure out how to create a new connection I've created one already here but I'll create a new one click the plus sign buying my sequel connections this could be slightly different in your version and it's already prefilled in the details here I didn't set a password my Newser name is a root which is a default this host name means basically just the computer whether my sequel server the database itself is running and this three 306 is the default port for my sequel so then I can click the test connection and it says successfully made the my sequel connection so you want to get to that point where you can see that your my sequel workbench can successfully connect your server don't forget you might have to start your server via your control panel or preferences or whatever you're using if you didn't select a bit stop when you start your computer when you installed it okay so that's it for this tutorial good luck with that and as I say if you run into any problems google it and as a last resort you can use just an online my sequel database to follow this tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll look at actually setting up a connection and issuing commands so until next time happy coding hello this is John from Cave of Programming calm now this is kind of a optional tutorial because I'm going to show you how to use my sequel on the command line if you don't know the command line for your system if you don't know command line console commands then you're going to get lost in this tutorial but I would advise watching it anyway because it will give you a little bit more insight into how my sequel works but don't worry about it because we're going to be using the workbench in subsequent tutorials so now that I've installed my sequel and I've made sure that it's stopped it's not started at the moment I'm going to go to terminal on my Mac so Windows has a Windows console and of course you have a terminal in whatever version of Linux you're using as well now my my sequel is actually installed I tracked it down to the following directory this is just for my particular system I'm gonna go to slash user local my sequel and of course some windows the commands that you see here are going to be different so you know you could either learn windows console commands or just skip this tutorial as I say let's go to that directory here's my actual my sequel installation now if we go to bin here we'll see there are lots of programs in there and there are two really important ones one is called my sequel D and that's the actual server program it's your actual database itself so we could start that from a command line if we added this directory the directory I'm in to path environment variable and again if you google file to do that for example Windows 7 path environment variable or you know Linux add to path environment variable then you could add that directory there and then you'll be able to type these commands these programs that you see here from any location in your terminal otherwise you're going to have to change to that this directory before you can run these so let's try and run the my sequel the my sequel server on the command line so to do that on a Mac and probably on Windows I have to use a sudo command to run this as admin and again this is not going to apply to Windows let's run sudo slash my sequel my sequel D and I'm going to specify new root this specifies use the root user which is the kind of default user for my sequel if you specify the password you'll also need to say P and your password like let me in for example with no spaces afterlife and P but I haven't specified a password so I just need this let's run this you'll have to enter your your admin password you'll use a password if you haven't already run sudo if you're using Linux or Mac that is so now we can see it started up successfully and I'm going to start a new terminal let's go to Shell new window with basic settings again this is just my other stuff but this is standard units UNIX commandline stuff so this will be the same or very similar on Linux again I'll go to that directory so slash use a local my sequel bit and now I can connect with the my sequel commandline tool so I'm going to just type mice well I have to type dot slash my sequel on Windows it would just be the command name without the dot slash or at least last time I use Windows that was the case ooh root and I run that now I've got on my sequel command line so there are two programs here my sequel D the actual server itself the actual database and is also than my sequel command line tool which enables you to connect to that database as a client as we say you're a client connecting to that database server and we're going to be issuing these commands in the workbench in future but I just wanted to show you this to help explain how this all works now I can issue a my sequel command and on a command line you have to terminate your commands with a semicolon so the simplest command that we can start off with is show space databases semicolon and a hit return and these are the different databases that I've got already by default in my my sequel server so you'll probably see something there hopefully you will and so although we've got one database server program we can have different databases in that so the different databases can be used for example by different programs or we can create a new database in there whenever we want to practice my sequel now I'm going to just quit that now so I'll type quit and it just says bye and we can close this to actually shut down this server from a terminal and you could like on Windows you could use your process manager or I forget what it's called on Windows but you have something that you can bring up to just shut down force processes to quit I'm going to use kind of UNIX command line here again and I'm going to go to shell new window on my Mac and so this if you're not familiar with this don't worry at all but I'm gonna type PS EF give me a list of processes in Unix and I can then actually modify that by saying a pipe character and insane grep of my sequel and I will narrow down the list of processes in the UNIX type system to show you which ones are running that have my sequel in the name so if I do that we can see that my sequel D is running here and that's the process ID eighty five seven so I'm gonna say pseudo to run as admin kill eight five seven and we've hopefully shut it down well it doesn't look very shut down so let's try this yeah actually we need this one here 909 let's try that the first one was the actual thing that I'm typing now I just run that and with a bit of luck yeah it shut down so if you have if you do try this and you get lost and you have a terrible problem shutting it down the thing to do would be just restart your computer hopefully after that it will work as normal and I will repeat my advice that if you do get into any difficulties with this you can't resolve them don't be afraid to Google it varies from system to system what you'll have to do but someone will have run into the error almost certainly that you're encountering and you can find that usually via Google searches so this all looks good and in a next tutorial we're going to connect via to my sequel workbench instead of via the my sequel client and we're going to start issuing commands so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming comm in this tutorial we're going to create a simple database in my sequel workbench we'll add a table to the database add some data to it and then query the table so my my sequel server is already running as I can tell if I go to this little utility for stopping and starting it so I'm going to go to my sequel workbench and on the home screen here so if you're not on a home screen already we did properly are you need to click this home button in the top left corner here's a connection I've already created I'm just gonna delete that for the moment so we can start from scratch I'm gonna click the plus button buy my sequel connections and we'll give this a name so let's call that tutorial or actually I'll just call it default because this is the only my sequel instance that I'm going to connect to with this workbench so we've got the user name in there we've got an IP address here which is the local high P address of this particular machine this isn't on the internet if it was on the Internet in this database my database server this IP address will be different and this is a port which we're going to connect on is the default for my sequel three three zero six and again if you are on the internet somewhere you'd use this information to connect your database but the defaults here which were already filled in for me apart from the connection name they're good for connecting to my local server so I'm going to click test connection it says it's okay so we'll click ok and now I've got this icon here so if your version of my sequel workbench works a bit differently don't worry about it and you just need to go through this sort of equivalent steps whatever they are on your version to get this working and it will be something similar to this let's double click this connection though so now it's opened a tab where I can write sequel commands I'm going to start with show databases and I'm going to execute that I could use the lightning strike button manganese command and return command and enter and on windows I guess it would be ctrl + Enter but that will execute the command if you've got the cursor on this lines let's do that so we can see these are the databases I've got at the moment and I'm gonna delete this command that I've just typed and add create database let's call it tutorial 1 and execute that the same way and then I can delete that and we can go back to show databases show databases so now we see and that we've got the tutorial 1 database created and we also see in the lower pane here which is really important that all the commands executed successfully so if you type something incorrectly then you'll see red arrow icons down here but these are all green showing me that all my commands are running it's really important to keeping an eye on that pane down here let's make it a bit bigger too to cheder your sequel commands are running correct now I can go ahead and create a table but first I need to tell my sequel that I want to work with this particular database that I've just created so I'm going to type use tutorial 1 which is the name of my database and execute that and again we see from the lower pane that it's executed successfully so you'd normally have like one database per different application that you're going to use to connect to it so if I'd if I have some application that I want to use a database I want it to be a shared database that I'm going to put on the internet for example then I create a different database within the my sequel database server like this for every application and everyone using that application could connect to the same database so we've created the database and we're using this database now I'm going to create a table so I'll say create table and let's give it a name let's call it users and after another space I'm going to put two round brackets and in here I need to specify what columns my table has so I'll just give this one column to start with I'm gonna call the column username it doesn't really matter whether you make this uppercase or lowercase I prefer lowercase myself or in the early days of sequel uppercase was more common and we're gonna we have to say what type this column is so what type of thing does it store I just want this to store text and I don't know what the length of the text is going to be so I'm gonna just say text here text as a built in my sequel type so this is one of the types of things that you can store in a date in a table column let's execute that and again we see the green icon at bottom here showing me that my syntax was correct then it's type show tables and execute that so now we can see in this sort of middle pane that is showing me the results of that query and it's saying we've got this table called users so we've just got one table in our database called users I can also if I want to see more information about that table because I've forgotten what's actually in it I can type desc users and execute that and then we see that we've got one column in there called user name of type text this sort of also tells me that it's allowed to be null so he could put by no empty values in there if we wanted and sequel the syntax of secret verse vary a bit between different databases and the commands that you used to switch to a database or view a table these in particular tend to vary between databases so desc users this might be different in a different database and also things like create database and show tables but the sequel plans you use to create tables they're fairly standard but again there's going to be minor differences between different types of database like Oracle or my sequel and in particular the types that you can use text or in different ages or whatever they're going to differ a bit between different kinds of databases so let's let's actually add some data to this table so we know we've got one column called username I'm going to type here insert into and the name of the table which is users and we're going to put round brackets in there and specify the columns that were inserting into so we just want to insert into the username column so I put that in her own brackets then after the brackets and then it's height values and another pair of round brackets and in the second pair of round bucket round brackets I can specify what values I want to insert in what I can only insert one value at a time here so let's in double quotes we use double quotes because this is a string it's some actual text rather than being say a numerical value so we put in double quotes and that's add in there a username like Bob I'm going to just execute that again we see that it's executed successfully and now well we could change and add another value in there so we'll have two rows and information and I table them let's change Bob for Vicki and execute that again so now we've got two users in our database and to see all the values in this table in our database he can add multiple tables in a database and you usually do but we've just got this one so I want to I want to look at all the values in this table now but I've inserted into it and to do that I'm going to type select star as asterisk from and the table name which is users and if I execute that we can now see here in the middle pane the values Bob and Vicki so when you see all of this stuff at first it seems really complicated and some people have a tendency to make a lot of notice and really agonize over it intellectually but the thing you have to do is just type this type these commands don't worry about the fact that you don't understand them fully at the moment perhaps just type them out and get them working make sure you can actually type these execute it so have a go this yourself create your own database call it whatever you like the database name and table names they will probably have to not have spaces in them in any case it's good practice certainly not to put spaces in database or table names but you can make it whatever name you like for your database or your tables in the database so try creating a table add some data to it and select the data from it so you can actually see it follow through the steps that I've actually done here because that's the really most effective way to learn and in the next tutorial we'll look at what else we can do we'll look at doing some more complex inserts and selects probably so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming comm in this tutorial we're going to learn creating tables with multiple columns and also go a lot at a new data type int so at the moment I've got a table called users if I do desc users we can see that table it's just got one column in in a moment one thing to note at this point is that if you're using the my sequel workbench you can click on the commands in this output pane right to the bottom right click them and go to replace sequel with selected items and that will actually overwrite what's currently in the sequel pane the query pane and replace it with that query you selected so it's a really useful feature if you want to reuse some sequel that you read that you executed previously and if you're using a command line often command lines have a feature where you can just press the up arrow to get back to previous queries usually a command line will give you some way of doing that even if you you have you might have to configure something sometimes to get it to work okay so let's take a look at this I'm going to actually drop this table in other words delete it I'm gonna say drop table users and that's let's just check let's do a double check let's do show tables and we can see that the users table is now gone so obviously you have to be careful with this query and I'm gonna say crave the table users so we're going to recreate it and I'm gonna create it with two columns I'm gonna say ID that's gonna be the name of the first column and I'm gonna make it an int and an INT is a numerical value in my sequel it can store integers and so not floatingpoint numbers you know with a decimal point in them just integer values and we'll put a comma in and make the second column now use the name text so now we've got two columns ID and username so in this in this statement here where you specify the columns at the table you can provide a comma separated list with there can be lots of columns in there to add multiple columns to your table let's execute this and where are we in fact if you I selected that and executed it which only excuse part of it I want the whole thing so I'll deselect that Roenick and yes it is run fine now and let's do it desk users so there we've got two values they are both allowed to be null at this point and we're going to look at that a bit more shortly let's just insert some data in there so this you can probably guess how this works in fact if you want to pause the recording pause the video and have a go at yourself you can probably figure it out let's try it let's say insert into users ID user name values and we'll put in let's put in one for the ID and the text goes in quotes the text values have to be in quotes and let's say username Bob so once again we can just replace where we previously had a single column we can replace it with comma separated list we'll run that and let's put another one in if it ran okay which I see the live dead let's put Vicki in run that and now let's do select star from users so we've got Bob and Vicki so that's it for this tutorial do have a go at that yourself you can even create tables with multiple columns you can have multiple text columns multiple integer columns whatever you like and then one thing probably that's worth mentioning already at this point is if you search in Google or your favorite search engine for my sequel types you can find a list of the different data types that you can use we've seen int and Tech so far but there's a lot of different types here if we go to numeric types for instance and then we go to integer types so we can see that an int it can store integers between these two big values but sometimes you want a smaller integer value it's better to use a smaller one if you know you're only going to small store small values of integers because that takes up less space in your database so you might use small in tinyint or conversely if you need a really massive integer in there you might want to use big end okay so that's it for this tutorial have a go at that because we're going to build on it in the next tutorial so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming comm in this tutorial we're going to take a look at null in my sequel as n ull null sonal is a special value that means that filled in your table doesn't have any value if we look at a table we've got now to use this table if we do a desk on it excuse us we see it has two columns and we see in the results grid here that they are they're both allowed to be null that's because we created them in the default way which would allow them normally to be null so we can do the following for example we can say in let's actually just bring up a query that I already run here so let's let's insert a row into the table I'll give it an idea of two but for the username I'll specify null and that means that for the username is not going to be any value for this row so I'm going to insert that and yes it went okay we can see down here and I'll do is select and run that so now we can see we've got a row with the idea of two but I set the username to no it has no value we can do the same thing with the other column as well because that's also allowed to be null we could even if we wanted making them both no like this and now if we do a select star from users we see we've got a row with two null values in it now often you don't want that often what you want is to specify that a particular value in a particular field it can't be null so you want to say that all the values in a certain column can't be null so we'll look at how to do this but first let's just take let's try something a little bit different so I'm gonna I'm gonna do another insert into this table let's try this and this time in my fields list here the list of columns I'm only going to specify one one column so I'm going to delete user name just as a random choice and I'm going to specify the value 3 for that column so we can easily see which which column it is so here I'm doing an insert where we're only inserting a value for one particular column and if I run this and then I do a select star from users what we see is that we've inserted a row with the ID equal to three but again we've got null for the username so you don't have to specify all the columns when you do an insert if you've got columns that are allowed to be null which they are if you create them in a default way you don't have to specify those columns when you do an insert and then the value will be null it will have no value for the row that you insert it sometimes we want to as I say we want to say that phase and a comment can't be no this is really common it's probably the the most frequent case because often we don't want data with sort of missing values in our database let's drop this table and say drop table users so that's going to delete the table and the table should be gone we can check with show tables if we like and we see there's no tables in this database and let's recreate it so I'm going to say create table users let's say ID we'll just use the same as before ID is going to be a int and let's make a username field which is going to be text username column I should say so if we create the table like this both of the columns are allowed to be null but we can put not no after any column to say that it can't be null so you can do that on any of the columns that you want to not be no let's let's try it let's try it with both of them I think we'll make both of the columns not null and then if we do it desk users we see that now they're not allowed to be null so now if I try doing stuff like let's bring up an insert here so I let's try well we'll try this let's just run this this is going to give an error we can't insert null values for either either of these columns now even if I specify an ID because I said also user name not know when I created the table this went wrong because even the user name by itself can't be null so again we get an error down here now it's interesting to see what happens if you insert a if you try to assert a row in a table with fields that are not allowed to be null but then you don't mention those names in your insert so let's try it well I will try getting rid of user name here and I'll try to insert a row with the ID of nine now if I run this on this particular version of my sequel configured the way it is what I find is that I get a warning icon down here and if I do now a so it's not an error that a sequel has run it's just giving me a warning if I do select star from users we see that what's happened is we did insert the row the user name appears to be blank so the user name is is not null it does have a value but this value is actually a blank string that's the default value for a text type I'm calling it a string because this is kind of a technical lingo for some characters you know a piece of text we call it a string so the default value for a test type is is a end is a blank string a string of zero length which is not the same as null if you try this on your database you might find that you get different results we're going to talk about that a bit in the next tutorial let's just try this again so this time what I'll do is I will try the ID in the field list and just specify username which are set to someone I don't know config name unless let's just run this so now again we've got a warning icon down there at the bottom in the output pane and if we try doing a select now we see that we've inserted a value we've inserted a row where the username is someone as I specified and again ID has a default value for its type and since idea is an int the default value for an INT is 0 now this this behavior you might get different behavior with your version of my sequel or it might be just that you if someone else installed there especially or if if my sequel developers decide to change the default options you might find that you can't do this that it won't let you not specify a value in an insert when the when the value is we've said it's not no when we create a table and we're going to look in our next tutorial at some configuration options that affect this so to practice this and certainly give this a go try creating a table with two or more columns and make some or even all of them not null and then try doing inserts in there try inserting explicitly inserting null values as I did near the beginning of the tutorial and try also just missing but those fields out of your field list in your insert statement and missmiss the mouse so try to insert a row where you're only speccing specifying values for certain columns and see what results you get with not in all fields does my sequel insert a default value for a field that you haven't specify a value for or does it do something else does it throw an error do have a go at that and then in the next tutorial we'll look at some config options so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to take a look at my sequel database engines so although this is not a tutorial on my sequel database administration it is a tutorial on using my sequel as as an end user and on learning sequel and working with a my sequel database nevertheless there are some configure of configuration options that affect how my sequel works so before we go any further we're going to have to take a look at some configuration related stuff because you're gonna need to know that in order to predict how your queries are actually going to work so I'm I've already typed a used tutorial one but there's no harm in typing it again so we're using the right database and now I'm gonna type show engines and execute that now what on my sequel engine is is it's a module a part of my sequel that deals with your sequel and constructs tables basically I'm not sure if the actual code that passes your queries is part of the engine but certainly the part of my sequel that constructs tables and decides what they can do what it can't do that's called an engine and there are my sequel supports various different engines now most of these I haven't used but there are two really important ones that you should know about historically my sequel as I remember it this is according to my memory and I've been working with my sequel probably since around 1999 I think historically my sequel was built around and I don't know how to place these names but I'll make up pronunciation it was built around this my I some engine now that was while it was a good start but it didn't support some really important features of databases it didn't support as I remember identical transactions and I presume still dozen it didn't support foreign keys even which as we'll see later on are really important to use so is a big step forward later on when my sequel came out with this I know DB engine which does support transactions does support foreign keys and if you do show engines hopefully you'll see that I know DB is set to the default now it is possible to change which engine you use and you're probably not going to want to for this tutorial you're going to want to make sure that I know DB is the default engine unless there's something even newer and better has come out since this tutorial in which case you could switch to that but in this tutorial we're going to be using the I know to be engine it is possible to it's possible to specify on a table by table basis which engine your table uses and again most of the time that's probably going to be pretty useless but it's quite common that if you see a sequel script that's intended to be executed to create a complete database after every table it will specify which engine each table is using and it's normally going to be the same engine every time and it's normally going to be I know DB so in case you see that in the script is kind of important to know about if we type in here show table status we can see which engine each of our tables is using we've only got one table at the moment and it's using the default I know DB but I could change that and there are a number of ways I could change it so let's create a table let's call it test and I'll give it just one column so let's say by t int and i'm gonna say next after this bracket I'm going to say engine equals and pick a different engine so the only one I've actually used is this my ice so let's go ahead and try that so I've executed that I've created the table and now let's look at show table status and we see that we've got a test table using this my I some database I'm going to delete that for a moment let's say drop the table test and we'll see another way of doing that so another way you could do this is you could set the default storage engine for your for your session so you could say set default yeah this is right I think it's set default storage engine equals my I son let's try that looks good and now lets us do show tables so there are tables just to remind ourselves we've only got one table now called users and I'm gonna do show table status okay that's good and let's also do show engine so we see that this want a we've got users is using IMDB as we saw before Sh let's do shell engines now we can see that my I son is set to the default so we'll try creating another table so great table I'll call it test again I'll say it's just a one column ID and I won't specify a storage engine so I'll execute that and then we'll do show table status and now we can see that the default really has been changed to my son as we we also saw when we did when we did show a show engines struggling to remember because these are commands that I very infrequently use most of the time you don't need to bother with this but I just want to show you show you this so you kind of are familiar with it and you're not puzzle if you come across it and you do want to make sure with show engines you do want to make sure that I know DVD is set to the default so that's that set I know the DB back to the back to the default and say set default storage engine equals I know DB I don't think the capital letters make a difference that but I'll put it all in capitals because that definitely works and then again we'll do show engines and now we can see yeah I know DB is back to the default now if you let's say you've got my secret installed and you find you're using it's a recent version of my sequel so it supports I know DB but you're for some crazy reason you find that is using my I son you can change it in your session as we've just seen or you can specify it after every table that you should use I know DB if necessary if you're the administer administrator of your my sequel server yourself you can also change this in a config file so this is this is not what this is kind of taking us a little bit away from the point of this course as a whole but I'm just gonna demonstrate that quickly so if you look in the my sequel folder you'll find this a my sequel dot CNF if you're using Linux or some kind of UNIX type system like the Mac and it's probably going to be called dot ini' if you're using Windows now although this is present in my my sequel installation folder here in fact on the Mac and you would have to check this if you want to do if you want to do it for Windows you have to check where the default location of this file actually is because it's actually not here this isn't the one that's actually being read on my on my system which is a Mac so let's go to a terminal now and again if you're not familiar with the terminal really don't worry about it because this is taking us off the main point of this tutorial anyway but what I had to do was I had to go to where this file is actually located that's going to see they use a local my sequel which is where it happens to be great happens to be located on my mark and it could be different for yours and this is it's really just a kind of down dummy configuration file and we look at it it's pretty simple it's just mostly most of these options they're just comments or they just commented out but what I did do what I've already done here and I've added this myself because at least in my version here it didn't already exist I've added this option default storage engine equals my by some so this is how you can configure it if you want to so on my mark there actual location that this file is really read from is in slash etc and of course it's going to be different on different systems so you have to Google this if you want to do it so here's my my dot CNF it will be my dot any on Windows I'm gonna do sudo fire my dot c NS so I'm just using some unix commands i'm familiar with already but you could edit this in any editor as long as you have to make sure it's not readonly otherwise you know you're not gonna be able to save it and this first check that there isn't already a default storage engine option in there and there isn't here so let's add it in fact let's stop the server first let's go to the system preferences and i'm gonna stop the my sequel server if i get a right admin password for my Mac it will really help a lot more haste and less speed okay so I've stopped there now I'm gonna put in here default storage engine just like the additive a nonworking demo version but now I'm really editing the version that's actually being used so I'm going to put my I son right in here and this my sequel D session so I've saved that and I'm gonna start my server again let's go to System Preferences start my sequel server then I'll go back to my my sequel workbench and I'm gonna Critias hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at a my sequel setting that affects how inserts are allowed to run when the insert is trying to insert into a table with not null values so we're going to look at another useful setting option to know about and in this course we're probably going to see at least one more very useful my sequel specific setting that you should know about so there's this setting called sequel mode and settings in my sequel in general can have global and local values so let's take a look at what that actually means and to start with I'm going to say select and this this following syntax is very very specific to my sequel so it's not a general sequel thing but I'm going to type to kind of add signs and let's put in here global dot sequel underscore mode so if we take a look at the value of this we see it set to strict all tables so if you want to read about what this actually does and I will explain in just a moment excuse me then we can search let's say in google for my sequel sequel underscore mode and in the first document that's linked to here you get my sequel documentation page and there you can see various ways of setting the sequel mode and you can see the most important sequel modes and just general various things you can set it to you can also see how to set it how to set this value in your configuration file to set it sort of permanently so we'll take a look at what this actually does in a minute and we'll see that it can't affect how our queries run but I also want to mention that there is also a session sequel mode so let's take a look at that and I appreciate that be a bit cryptic at the moment but all will become hopefully clear shortly so let's say two up signs and a session dot sequel mode so we can run this select statement with multiple values as long as they're separated by commas and if we run this we find that my global and sequel global and session sequel modes are actually set to different values and that's just because I've been playing around with it a bit so when I when I installed my sequel the default for both of them was no engine substitution now the global version of any setting in general that's that's going to set the value for any connection that's made to the server so if someone else connected to the server or you you ran an app that also connected to the server in addition to this my sequel workbench if you've set the global mode that's going to affect these other connections as well whereas if you set the session mode that is only going to affect this particular session in other words it's going to affect this connection that you've made now and if you drop the connection in the workbench and start it again then the session sequel mode is going to default back to the global sequel mode so there are sessions here but are also global values that you can set for any connection that's made your server if you restart the server you're going to lose both of these and they're going to default either to the default values or to whatever you set in the config file so if you want to set a variable like one of these permanently you need to set that in the config file so this will be sequel mode equals suchandsuch so what actually are these values so the session sequel mode is the one that's is actually going to affect this session and I've got it set to no engine substitution which was the default when I run my sequel now according to the documentation what this value actually does no engine substitution is that if you specify when you create the table if you specify an engine as we saw in the last tutorial but you misspelled the engine or something or you specify an engine that's not available then if this variable is not set my sequels gonna just substitute some available engine whatever the default engine is set to for that misspelled unavailable engine if this is if this is set it's not going to do that so if you specify an engine that doesn't exist then it's not going to substitute it with some default value so if we do for example crate let's get rid of this and say create table test one ID int engine equals some gobbledygook if no engine substitution is set then it's not going to execute that query now the one what we're really interested in here is setting a mode called strict or tables and let's see what effect that actually has so if I I've got less let's go to use tutorial one I'm already using this database we're just want to show you from beginning case case it's confusing now so we're going to say use a tutorial one database I'm gonna say show tables these are commands that I do use a lot and we see we've got this user's table in here I don't actually need this test table so I'm just gonna do drop table test what I think about it and now if we do show tables the test table will have disappeared we just got users let's do desc users and we can see that we created this table so that both of the fields can't be null now with the default setting at least the default setting I got when I installed my sequel outofthebox and that this is something that you should try for yourself if we do insert into users and set into our table we only specify one column in there so we don't specify all of the columns that are not null now we say values let's specify for this just nine or something and we run this and we look at a query it has actually run but with a warning and so if we do select star from users we see that we've inserted that row and my sequel has inserted a default value for username which for a string type a text type is an empty blank string so it's not know but my sequel has made up a value for it which is the default value now that may be the behavior you want and in this tutorial I'm going to just carry on like that I'm gonna stick with this option because I want to try to use the settings that you most likely got out of the box and this is how my version of my sequel came to me when I just installed it this time around but sometimes you might want to change that you might want to say okay if I've got not null values in my table values that can't be null if someone tries to do an insert on that table and they don't specify a value for the not null columns for all of them not nor columns then the query should fail you might want to say that rather than let my sequel make up a default value for it and if you want to do that you can change the sequel mode so we could do for example set let's say global set wellthat's sessions may be the most useful as they set session sequel mode equals and we could set it to some value in here and you can see the most important values in the my sequel document but an easy way to do this would assess both the local and global values of a setting at the same time in this case the sequel mode setting is just to say set sequel on the score mode equals and I'm going to set this to I set it to strict or tables well I'm using single quotes here but in sequel it doesn't matter so that I could just use double quotes and should be fine let's run this and we see that the query not so much query but a statement run successfully and now let's do select in fact I'll just bring up this query that I used previously so we'll look at the global and session values of this sequel map variable and we see that both been set to strict or strict or tables if I now try to insert into a table and I don't specify a value for one or more of the columns that are not allowed to be null let's try this with the value 10 for ID and I won't give a value for username which is not null let's run this now we see that it gives an error and although errors don't seem like a good thing sometimes that's what you want if you have a program that's executing sequel statements it can be really bad if they run silently but they and they appear to succeed but they don't actually do what you want so if you run a sequel statement in your program it's good practice to check somehow that that hasn't run and created an error and the same applies kind of if you run a sequel statement by hand like we're doing here sometimes it can fail silently you think it's work but it hasn't actually done what you want so sometimes you want to make sure that queries fail when you do something that you don't really want them to do and by setting this equal no variable we've made sure that we have to specify values for all the fields that are specified as not null in our table so it's worth having a go at this yourself take a look at your global and local session modes like there see what they're set to they should be set to the default to both the same thing you know unless you change one of them they should be set to both the same thing and you and you might want to try changing the sequel mode as I just did so that's this one too strict or tables and then try to insert into a table as I just did not specifying the value for it and not nor column and check that if it does fail if you set strict or tables but I'm gonna set this back to no engine substitution for the purpose that this purposes of this tutorial although really if I was running some sort of production database that actually really mattered I probably would like to turn strict or tables on just to give me a bit of extra sort of error checking and also if you just stop your server and restart it then you'll get whatever default values are specified in your configuration file and a couple of little things I just want to mention one thing is that if you didn't find the configuration file in your my sequel directory install directory at all I should have mentioned this in the last tutorial really you can't just Google for like a default one on the internet and just copy that or even just write it out yourself just Google for what it should be in a typical my sequel configuration file remember you have to put it in the right location if you actually want to use it and you have to restart your server but my download of my sequel did include a dummy sort of default configuration file my doctor CNF or it could be my top any on Windows it's just that it wasn't in the right place and also with queries in general because I used different databases from time to time even though I've been using my sequel for a very long time I can still get confused because sequel syntax does vary between different databases and also if you don't if you don't use a particular database for a few months things can start to get confused in your mind and you forget the exact database specific syntax for sequel queries so one good place to look is certainly the my secret documentation but often this is sort of a little bit cryptic and often it's easier just to do something like my sequel select query query example so if you forget for example how to do a select query then you can pretty easily find just examples of what that actually looks like like concrete examples and that's sometimes better than looking at the documentation ok well leave it there for this tutorial do have a go at setting strict or tables and see what effect that has for you on your system and check what mode you're currently using as well so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of program programming calm in this tutorial were going to take a look how to delete all the data from a table so when you're learning sequel often it's really useful just to be able to clear out a table without deleting the table itself and at the moment if I do use tutorial 1 which is my database name and I do show tables we can see that we've got this we've got this users table so if I do select star from users that's just going to have whatever junk in it you happen to have added in the course of your experimentation now to delete data from a table you can just do delete from table name I just want to draw your attention to the fact that select us a star in it but the delete from statement which we'll see in a second doesn't and that's because when we do is select as we'll see later on you need to specify which columns you're going to actually output and star means output all columns now since the delete just works on all the different fields in a rows of all the columns you don't need that star with the delete statement so we would just just type delete from in this case users this isn't going to actually work but let's run it so it says in the console here in the action output pane you are using safe update mode and there's some more information that if you're a complete beginner if you're new to this you won't understand yet although we're going to cover the stuff that it mentions in the future basically there's a setting in secret and my secret which the default option is to not let you do a delete without actually narrowing down which particular rows you want to delete but for learning purposes often it's better to switch that off if you've got a production database with data in it that you need to keep safe it's a really good thing that you can't just delete all the rows without specifying which particular rows you want to delete and that's what this option prevents you're doing it prevents you deleting all the rows without actually specifying particular rows but for this tutorial purpose for purposes of learning my sequel we're going to want to switch that option off so you can check what your option is set to by doing select and what we're really interested in is the value of this variable in the session which is going to be whatever their default is let's say two up signs the session dot and its sequel safe of Dave's I think let's run this and we see that that's set to one meaning it's on so if it was set to zero that's off so session sequel safe updates is what's what's controlling this behavior and we can actually do set up a case the lower case doesn't matter set sequel safe updates equals zero let's try that that seems to work I'm always surprised because it's really hard to remember these the exact syntax of these commands that I don't use very often and so it's sequel safe updates with underscores in there let's check the value of the session variable now to see what it is so now it's set to not and now finally we can do delete from users run that so we see now that it executed fine you can see that in the lower pane and if we do select start from users then we see there's nothing in it now so do try that for yourself try doing a delete from and the name of the table you've created and put some data in and probably it won't work so then you need to check the value of this session sequel safe updates variable with this kind of syntax and then you can actually change it if it's set to one you can change it to zero and check it again to make sure it really has changed and then you should be able to do delete from and your table name to delete all the rows in your table okay so until next time happy coding hello this is John from cave of programming comm in this tutorial we're going to take a look at primary keys in my sequel so I'm gonna say use tutorial one as usual and I'm gonna say show tables then at the moment I've just got one table in here called users so I'm gonna do drop table users because I want to recreate this table now I'll say create table users and let's give this a ID of type int and we'll give it a let's go in a name field I'll just call it name stead of user names is shorter of type text and also let's have email of type text now before I create this table it's good practice in sequin in general to make sure that every table has a thing called a primary key and what this is is it's one of your columns which in that column the values in that column are going to uniquely identify each row so for every row in your table the primary key will have a different unique value and it can't be null its usual to make and the primary key a integer type you can make it another type so for example if you had a table with that had a column of which was like a username column in so you had a table of users and each user had a you eeeek username important that is unique you could choose to make the username the primary key you can't do that with tight text on a counter text being a variablelength feel but later on we will see fixedlength text fields text types that you could use in your primary key but a bottom line is that every table ideally should have a primary key and that's ideally that should be of an integer type because that will give you the fastest resource with your queries but it is possible to use text types as we'll see later on so I'm going to make this ID column here which is which is an integer type my primary key so that's going to contain a value that's gonna be unique for every row in a database let's say primary key after int here so I'll run this now and then if we do a desk users we can look at the type of it's table so we see that the ID field can't be null and that's because primary Keys can't be no in general if you want you can say primary key not know but that's implied by that just the fact that you made it a primary key and we see here that it is the primary key you see that the type is in brackets 11 the 11 doesn't actually refer to the number of digits you can store in there or anything is purely a relatively unimportant display feature which means that if you have a integer in that it's smaller than 11 digits my sequel in some circumstances depending on how you do the query what you do the query with will left pad the integer with spaces I think easily left but it but that's not that's not really important so this brackets 11 is not so important it just somehow sometimes under some circumstances it will affect where the small integers you know get displayed in a field that has 11 spaces in it or not but it won't truncate your integers or anything like that doesn't affect how many digits you can store in that I think for an int in any case a normal int you can get ten digits in that but if you see if you google for my sequel numeric types you'll find more information on that okay so let's see what we can do with the primary key I say insert into users by Dean name and email of values and we'll put zero in for the ID and we'll have a name and say Bob and an email Bob I'll just type some nonsense in there I don't know whether this site actually exists but what will at the end so I'll go ahead and execute that it's executed fine now we could you know happily insert other stuff in that let's insert some other stuff and we'll give this a primary key value of one so that that's worked as well we can see those values of course in the normal way select star from users and there we go but now let's try to do some things that won't work so if we go and we let's bring back this query if for example we try to insert some data with a primary key that already exists in there that won't work so if we execute this it won't execute because you can't have to look at values in a primary key column the point of it is to uniquely identify every row in a table similar similarly you can't have a null for primary keys automatically not null so this query this statement won't execute either so the primary key must be you means most often you make it an integer and sometimes I see users doing stuff own beginners with my sequel I seen them do things like they'll take the file you are another key let's say that had a user named Bob and then I'll append something to that username which is already in the database to make it you mean like an underscore in some digits this is very bad practice you shouldn't duplicate data in your database because imagine if you had a user with the user named Bob and they had a primary key zero this is fine there's no data to application but if if you had the primary key as a text value and remember you can't use the text ID for a primary key but there are text types that you can use which we'll see later so if it was a text type you might think okay I'll do this Bob on the score like this that's not a good idea because now you're duplicating some data it takes some unnecessary space and what if you want to rename Bob what if Bob changes his name then you've got to rename it both here and here which is even more difficult so try to avoid having any duplicate data in your database you need to get all the duplicate data out there of course if you have two separate users and they both happen to have the same name that's not considered duplicate data this is the unique name for each user it's just that they happen to have the same name but there again if they do have the same name you can't use their name as a primary key because the primary key really must have duplicate values in it the point is just that you don't want to repeat data in your database so you don't want to have the name of one particular user repeated in two places but if two people had the same name that's fine as long as you're not trying to put the same name of two different users in a field where you can't have duplicates like a primary key so anyway the way to get to grips with this is really just to play about it a bit so do try this create a table with some columns in it give it a integer type primary key insert some data in there and then check that you can't insert duplicate values for the primary key and check me you can't insert null values for the primary key because even if this does seem complicated to you at first just by typing this stuff out it'll start to remain in your head and it will start to become understandable even if you get to a point either now or later with course where you're struggling typing this out and actually singing work is really the key to understanding that okay so until next time happy coding hello this is John from Cave of Programming dotcom in this tutorial gonna take a look at auto incrementing primary keys so I'm gonna drop my users table again get rid of it and I've got a actually right drop table users in there and now I'm going to recreate the table similar to what we had before so what we had before was something like this great table users and the columns are ID int which is the primary key we've got name text and email text but actually for the purposes of this tutorial let's just let's just have a name in there because it'll save a little bit of time so and the only sort of problem with this which is a sort of problem is that the ID field here we have to invent a unique value for it now sometimes that's what you want sometimes you're running some software or something and you naturally get an ID when I use a crater and a new account let's say on your system and you want to insert the ID and a database and there are ways of course of doing queries and checking that the new idea is unique this sort of thing but sometimes it's nice if you can just get my sequel to invent an ID for you and you can do that by making a primary key auto increment so let's let's drop this users table again I'm going to go back to the stuff that I just typed and I'm gonna after primary key so we fall at comma I'm going to type Auto underscore increment so this is a very my sequel specific keyword and what it does is it means that you can do inserts without specifying an ID and the ID that will be assigned to each row will just be incremented or increased from whatever the last value that was used was and it's gonna start of one so let's create that table now and we'll say insert into users and now I won't specify an ID so I just specify the one column we've got now which is at the moment it's just the name column and we'll say values but by the way I did a bit of checking and apparently although I've always mixed double and single quotes except where I was using a database that really wouldn't accept one or one or the other apparently single quotes are considered the kind of default standard thing to use in sequel but my sequels seems to be just fine with double quotes anyway let's insert something into that let's insert Bob that's the quotes around your and text values of string values so we'll insert that and we'll do a select star from users select star from users and we can see that we've inserted Bob and even though we didn't specify an ID this time and even though it's a primary key so it has to have a value we can see that because it's auto increment it's automatically assigned Bob the value of one and of course if you insert another value let's insert another one then it's gonna go to two as you might expect let's so let's take a look here and now it's two now my sequel won't allow zero in an auto increment column so let's take a look at that supposing we do specify the ID and we specify it let's say as three or any number greater than two that's gonna work and we can do the Select now and we see that the ID value of three which we have specified for this Auto increment column now it my sequel would accept that just fine it's going to accept any valid value here which is going to be anything other than zero or some value that we've already got in this column or some value that's too big to fit in there which would be a really big number but if we if we try to insert zero we get different results now this depends on your settings I'm pretty sure that in the past I've tried to do this it just hasn't run the query so I'm sure that's configurable but if we just run this now and we do a select on it with the settings that I've got here which is pretty much the yes it's just the outofthebox settings that it came with what happens is if you specify zero for an auto increment column as we just did just right here then it just kind of ignores the zero and it proceeds as though you haven't specified any value for it so it'll give us giving the next available ID in the sequence okay so that's it for this tutorial have a go yourself create a table with that primary key if you want to that is try and certain into it and also see what happens if you try to insert zero and your your system maybe it won't run the query or maybe it will just ignore it and insert an auto incremented value in any case so until next time happy coding
