multivariable calculus is just calculus but with more than one variable for single variable calculus we performed our operations on functions that look like y equals f of x where the function had one input value that generated one output value we are going to be looking at functions that have more than one input variable here's the formal definition definition a function f of two independent variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair x y in sunset d exactly one real number f x y there's no reason that we have to stop at just two input variables we could have three or more independent variables and everything would still work the same it's just that these are much more difficult to visualize and so we'll primarily be sticking with two variables and although we won't discuss it now you may also want to think about what happens if you have multiple output variables just as with single variable functions we have the concept of the domain of a function definition the domain of a function f is the set of all inputs at which the function is defined we are going to be using the socalled natural domain of the functions what this means is that if the function is given as a formula than unless explicitly told otherwise the domain is the set of all points for which the function makes sense the key things to look for are that values under a square root are not negative and that the denominators of fractions are not zero for example let's determine the domain of the function f of x y equals 1 over x minus y we want to know the values of x and y that we can plug in and get a meaningful result we can observe that the fraction makes sense as long as the denominator is not zero in other words we need x minus y to be not equal to zero or y is not equal to x we are going to draw this domain on the x y plane we want everything except for the points that lie on the line y equals x so we will shade in the whole plane except for a dashed line corresponding to line y equals x the dashed line is how we indicate that this collection of values is to be removed this notation is also common when drawing the edge of other boundaries that are excluded such as circles or rectangles a slightly more complex example is f of x y equals the square root of 2x minus y plus 1. here we need the expression under the square root to be nonnegative so that two x minus y plus one is greater than equals zero in other words y is less than or equal to two x plus one the graph of that domain looks like this notice that we are using a solid line because we want the boundary to be included this time the important thing here is that you're not trying to memorize any formulas at this point in your mathematical career you should be able to recognize when these types of expressions do and do not make sense by just thinking about it the two big clues to look for are square roots and fractions you should not take the square root of a negative number and you should not divide by zero as with single variable functions there are multiple ways to represent functions of two variables one of the first ways we learned to represent a function is by creating a chart of values but rather than arranging the chart in a single column it's usually better to make a two dimensional table when working with a function of two variables it's important to label the input values so you know which one is which for reasons that will make sense shortly the x values are in the vertical direction and the increase going down the page we can then fill in every position with the number we get from the formula when we plug in the corresponding values another way to represent a function is with a graph there are two input variables and one output variable so we need to work in three dimensions we will imagine that we've drawn the standard x y axis on a sheet of paper placed on a table with a positive x axis pointing towards us notice that the y axis would point to the right we've drawn the xy grid in this picture for emphasis and you should imagine looking down on the sheet of paper from above and rotating your head a little to get the normal orientation then the output function will be the height relative to the table with positive numbers being above the table and negative numbers below we will label this with the z axis here's a graph of the function some people describe this as kind of like an upside down bowl technically this is known as a paraboloid in math we often call the graph a surface and you should think of it like the outer surface of a ball or vase the surface itself is twodimensional meaning that a small piece of the surface looks like a plane but the whole surface curves its way around in three dimensions there's much more we can say about the geometry but we'll leave that aside for now and focus on building up some more concepts an important new element of threedimensional geometry is that we have two different orientations in chemistry this is known as chirality the idea is that the mirror image of something in three dimensions is different from the original if you've ever used work gloves and put a glove on the wrong hand you've experienced this phenomenon the same thing happens with our coordinate axes there's a righthanded system and a lefthanded system in order for our images to be consistent it's helpful to stick with the same system neither one is inherently better than the other but the righthanded system is a more natural generalization for us it's also how we set things up earlier there are a number of ways to think about this if you draw the x and y axes in the traditional way and lay the paper down on a table the z axis will point up out of the table towards your face another way that this is described is that if you point your index finger on your right hand in the positive x direction and your middle finger in the positive y direction then raising your thumb points in the positive z direction and yet another way to think about this is that if you think about grabbing the zaxis with your thumb pointing in the positive direction the direction your fingers curl shows the rotation from the positive xaxis to the positive yaxis some students find it helpful to cut off the corner of a box and label the edges to get a physical manipulative to help develop the correct intuition it will take some time and experience to determine which visualization works best for you a good exercise is to draw your axes in random orientation being sure to note the positive direction and then randomly label them as either x y or z from this are you able to determine which direction the remaining positive axis points here are a couple examples pause the video and give it a try you should be able to get it with a little bit of thoughtful effort in the next video we'll begin to explore some common surfaces and some important formulas in the x y plane the lines x equal a and y equals b are not only basic but fundamental to the coordinate system when we put a bunch of these lines together they give us our coordinate grid notice that the x equals two line is vertical line that corresponds to all the points where the x coordinate is two and the y equals three line is a horizontal line that corresponds to all the points where the y coordinate is three these two lines form a rectangle with the axes and the point two three is the corner of that rectangle another way to say this is that the point two three is the point that lies on the intersection of these two lines we're going to take the same idea and apply it to three dimensions here is our right handed coordinate grid the point 2 3 1 can be found by moving 2 in the x direction 3 in the y direction and 1 in the z direction notice that the first two parts match up with what you normally do on the x y plane and then we've added on the third movement in the third dimension we're creating a threedimensional picture in a twodimensional medium so we're going to help ourselves visualize a bit by turning this picture into a picture of a box notice that if we take away all the reference lines it's impossible to visualize where on the grid the point is located again these are the challenges of drawing threedimensional objects in two dimensions so we'll put the box back from this picture we can identify the x equals two plane as being the plane that contains the front of the box all the points in that plane have the property that their x coordinate is two notice that this is parallel to the yz plane which is the plane formed by the y and z axes we can similarly see that the y equals 3 plane is on the right side of the box parallel to the xz plane and that the z equals one plane is the top of the box which is parallel to the x y plane the box we drew here is analogous to the rectangle we drew before in that the intersection of all three of these planes gives us the point two three one it's an important fact that all the sides of the box are perpendicular to each other this is helpful because that means we can use the pythagorean theorem to derive the distance formula in three dimensions remember that the pythagorean theorem says that if you have a right triangle then the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse if we have a box where one corner is located at x zero y zero z zero and the opposite corner is located at x one y one z z1 then we can use the pythagorean theorem twice to get the length of the long diagonal we first apply it once to get the length of the diagonal across one of the faces of the box and then use that length in another right triangle that stands up out of the plane you'll need to think a little bit to figure out the lengths of the sides of the box but it's the same concept used in two dimensions so i trust you'll be able to work it out the end result is known as the distance formula and it tells you how to calculate the distance between any two points in three dimensions we say that the threedimensional distance formula is a generalization of the twodimensional distance formula because we can derive the twodimensional formula from it all we would need to do is set both zero and z1 to be equal to zero which is saying that we're looking at points on the x y plane once we make that substitution the last term cancels out and we have the two dimensional distance formula recognizing these relationships helps us to see how our ideas relate to each other which helps to better understand the material once we have this formula we can use it to construct the equation of a sphere a sphere is the set of points x y z that are a fixed distance r from a specific point x zero y zero z zero the distance r is called the radius and the specific point that we're measuring from is called the center all we need to do is convert this sentence into a formula by convention we square both sides of the equation because it's easier to square numbers than it is to take the square root and this gives us the standard equation of a sphere again we can compare this to the twodimensional equivalent which is a circle in fact we can line up these formulas and see just how similar they all are to each other although we're not going to use it in this class you should be able to come up with a reasonable conjecture for what this formula would look like if we add a fourth dimension a common variable choice for that is w but as the number of dimensions get larger we often change our labels to be numerically based rather than using more letters of course it's one thing to write down a formula and it's quite another to try to visualize it the idea turns out to be related to the topic of the next video but will leave you to explore the fourdimensional world on your own when trying to understand the shape of these threedimensional graphs it can be helpful to reduce it back to two dimensional shapes one way of doing that is by creating traces here's the definition definition a trace of a function f of two independent variables x and y in the x direction is a curve of the form z equals f x c where c is a constant similarly a trace of the function f in two independent variables x and y in the y direction is a curve of the form z equals f of c y where c is a constant this is a lot of words so what does it mean let's focus on the first part we're evaluating the function along points of the form x c in other words we fix the y value and we're letting the x value be free to move it's a trace in the x direction because the movement is in the x direction notice that the points x c are points along the line y equals c we are seeing what the function is doing as we move along that line another way of saying this is that we're looking at where the surface intersects the plane y equals c visually this picture feels odd because our two images aren't lined up with each other this is just something you're going to have to get used to you will want to practice visually rotating pictures so that the axes line up for this picture if you wanted to make them line up better you can rotate the twodimensional picture so that the positive xaxis points down which is more like having the positive xaxis pointing towards you the second part of the definition is the same idea just with the xcoordinate fixed and the ycoordinate free to move notice that we've oriented the twodimensional picture in the conventional way and we'll leave it as a mental exercise for you to line them up you may want to pause the video for a moment and do that quick exercise we've actually seen these traces already but we didn't bring any attention to them when we were graphing by plotting points we created a grid of values and then we also showed a graph of the function we'll draw the trace in the x direction along y equals 2 and highlight those values in the chart the graph has many more points plotted than what the chart shows but you can see the pattern of values increasing and then decreasing again you can also see that we can derive the formula for the trace by simply substituting the appropriate value in for y in the same way we can do a trace in the y direction by fixing x to be equal to 1. this corresponds to a row of values on our chart in fact the graph itself is nothing more than a large collection of traces you should practice mentally tracing the shapes of the parabolas going in both the x and the y directions this is a skill that you can develop over time so that you can more easily visualize threedimensional graphs you can further build this intuition by looking at common objects and imagine that you're slicing them into pieces and trying to visualize what each of those slices would look like all of this helps to build your threedimensional visualization skills and intuition a similar concept to traces is that of a level curve traces are what you get when you slice a graph using planes with either the x or the y variable being fixed a level curve is what you get when you slice a graph using planes with the z variable being fixed in other words a level curve tells us all the points on the graph that are at a specific height this gives us another way to understand the shape or behavior of a function here's the formal definition definition a level curve or a contour of a function f of two independent variables x and y is a curve of the form k equals f of x y where k is a constant this definition actually gives us a method of creating level curves we simply pick some k values which correspond to specific heights and then look at what we have when we set our function equal to those values let's look back at the example we used earlier what is the level curve at height zero we simply set the left side to zero and move terms around to get x squared plus y squared equals four in other words we get a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin let's look at the trace at height 1. this gives us a circle of radius squared of 3. and at height 2 we get an even smaller circle when we put these pictures together with a couple more into one graph we get a contour map notice that we've labeled the individual circles so that we can tell which is which strictly speaking the level curves all live on the x y plane but we can visualize in three dimensions to better understand the shape of the surface all we need to do is raise these curves to the specified heights and from this we can start to see the outline of the same shape that we've been looking at earlier here it is one more time with the mesh we can actually understand some of the features of the surface without having to think in three dimensions notice that in this collection of level curves the curves get closer together as the value of k gets smaller the closest of these curves is related to the steepness of the surface if the contour lines are close together the graph is steep in that area if there are very few contour lines it means it's less steep a practical application of this is reading a topographical map if you're going hiking this is a topographical map of the land near nevada state the level curves correspond to specific altitudes and can be used to understand the shape of the terrain where there aren't many contour lines the land is basically flat this region is the part of the land that slowly moves uphill towards the base of the mountains and over here is mount scorpion we can see that there are lots of contour lines which makes sense because that's a mountain the usgs has a wide collection of free topographical maps to look at if you want to know more about the shape of the earth near where you live the book ends this section with a collection of graphs that are represented in both 3d and as level curves it is a good exercise to look at these pictures and practice going back and forth between the two pictures you should also try to think about the shapes of the traces the online book also provides some links to some webbased graphing tools if you want to explore these things further before we can discuss calculus we need to introduce an extremely important part of the mathematical language called vectors vectors are a very general concept that appears in many forms throughout mathematics for this class we're going to be sticking to the basic concepts definition a vector is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction the most basic geometric representation of a vector is an arrow more formally these are known as directed line segments which really just means that the arrows we draw need to be straight the pointy end is often called the tip as in the tip of an arrow and it's sometimes called the head as an arrowhead the opposite end is usually called the tail notice how an arrow satisfies the property of being a vector each arrow has a specific length which is the magnitude and each one points in some specific direction what's important about this is that it gives us the ability to describe when two of these arrows are the same here are two pairs of arrows in the pair on the left we can see that they are different because their lengths are different and in the other pair the arrows are different because they point in different directions even though they are parallel to each other from this we can intuitively recognize what it means for two of these arrows to be equal to each other they are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction notice that this means we don't care about where the arrows are drawn we are only looking at the magnitude and the direction we are now going to think about vectors in the context of the x y plane if we draw an error on the plane we can describe it by measuring how far in the x and y directions you must travel to get from the tail to the tip for example for this vector you move 3 in the x direction and 2 in the y direction we denote this vector as 3 comma 2 with pointy brackets this is known as the component form of a vector with 3 being the x component and 2 being the y component it's very important that you use pointy brackets and not parentheses as this helps us distinguish points from vectors the point 3 2 is drawn in exactly one way but there are many ways we can draw the vector 3 2. but just because they aren't the same it doesn't mean that they aren't related if we draw the arrow with the tail at the origin we say that it is in standard position when we draw the vector a b in standard position its tip is at the point a b if we draw the vector that connects the point q to the point r we denote this as the vector pointing from q to r the notation says this in an intuitive way if we have the coordinates of the points we can then calculate this vector by taking the difference notice that to get the vector from q to r we have to subtract the coordinates of q from the coordinates of r this is the ending position minus the starting position if you're ever not sure which to subtract from which you can always sketch a simple picture and try it both ways to see which one gives you the correct values although we're only working in two dimensions for now vector notation easily generalizes to as many dimensions as we want by just adding in more components as we've already done a few times in this video we often use subscripts to keep track of the components rather than introducing more letters especially when we get beyond three dimensions a quick word about notation when i write my vectors i always mark them with a vector symbol above them the reason is that vectors are a different type of objects and numbers and this vector symbol reminds me of that textbooks tend to use boldfaced fonts for vectors the reason for this is mostly historical it used to be very difficult and expensive to typeset vector arrows but the use of the bold font was readily available as an option as a student this always annoyed me a little bit because it was very easy to overlook the bold font which caused me all sorts of problems so throughout these videos i will always use a vector arrow for vectors just to be absolutely clear about what type of object a symbol is supposed to represent i recommend you adopt the vector arrow for your writing as well the book has some good exercises to help you build your intuition about what vectors represent and how they interact with each other we saw earlier how to compare vectors geometrically two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction this geometric description is fine for our intuition but we need to formalize this because while it's good for intuition it's hard to put into practice in this form so we will now take a look at that idea from an algebraic perspective if we represent the vectors u and v using component form we can see that the only way the vectors are going to be equal to each other is if the corresponding components are equal otherwise either the magnitude or the direction or possibly both will not match up for higher dimensional vectors we would need all the corresponding components to be equal to each other the interplay of the algebra and the geometry vectors will be very important to us as we keep moving forward and you'll see that we're going to move back and forth between the two frameworks in order to make sure that we have a robust understanding of both of them so far we've talked about the basic structure of a vector in the next video we're going to see how arithmetic and algebraic operations can be applied to vectors this video is all about performing various operations on vectors both in algebraic and geometric settings please note that i'm doing these sections in a different order than the book i prefer starting with the geometric approach possibly because i have a background in physics and so vectors to me carry physical concepts of velocity force acceleration and other ideas that i find to be geometrically intuitive for this video we're going to look at this through displacement a vector can be thought of as a description of movement you start from the tail and move to the tip if we're going to add vectors we're going to do one movement followed by another in other words we perform the motion described by the first vector and then perform the motion described by the second vector the question we're trying to answer is what is the overall movement in this understanding to add the vectors we use the tip to tail method meaning that the tip of the first vector becomes the tail of the second vector then the overall movement is the vector that points from the very beginning of the motion to the very end of it we call this the resultant vector there's another picture of this that you will see which is the parallelogram law for adding vectors for this you put the tails together and use the vectors as the side of a parallelogram then the resultant vector is the diagonal starting from where the tails are joined together this picture has a number of applications especially in linear algebra so it's good to be aware of it at least for getting started i found that more students tend to gravitate towards the idea of movement but it's important to be aware of both before we talk about subtraction we're going to talk about scalar multiplication the word scalar should remind you of the word scale which should bring to mind a proportional stretching or shrinking of an object such as with maps or models being at a certain scale scalar multiplication is a matter of stretching the vector along its direction of motion and for this class scalars will always be real numbers so if this is the vector u then the vector 2u is what you get when you double the length and one half u has half the length if we multiply by a negative number then we stretch by the corresponding value and also flip the direction with this in mind to calculate the vector u minus v we're going to think of it as u plus negative v writing subtraction as addition of the opposite is a pattern that goes all the way back to some of your early arithmetic and comes up throughout your study of algebra so this should feel very familiar and intuitive by this point to subtract vectors we flip the direction on the second vector and then add as usual we've demonstrated that here with the tip to tail method there are other geometric methods out there that do tip to tip and other things like that but i found that students tend to get confused because there are too many different rules to remember so i think it's best to stick with one method for addition and work with that until you have more experience now that we have established the geometric framework we're going to use that to think through the algebraic framework let's draw some vectors on a coordinate grid and write them out in component form if we were to add them together geometrically using the tip to tail method it would look like this and if we look at the resultant we can see that the total x movement is the sum of the individual x movements and that the total y movement is the sum of the individual y movements and this observation allows us to write down an algebraic formula for the sum of vectors when they are written in component form to add vectors in component form we add together the corresponding components using the same idea we can look at the case of scalar multiplication if we double the length of the vector we double both of its components and this is a general pattern for multiplying a vector by a scalar each component gets multiplied by the scalar in many ways this behaves like the distributive property and we'll see more about that later when it comes to the algebraic manipulation of vectors there are some important vectors known as the standard unit vectors these are the building blocks of all our vectors and are extremely important conceptual and computational object to have in two dimensions the standard unit vectors are the vectors 1 0 and 0 1 which are denoted by i and j we like these vectors because they allow us to take vectors written in component form and rewrite them using a more natural algebraic notation using some basic vector operations that we've developed the vector a b in component form becomes a i plus b j this manipulation is helpful because the i and j vectors behave exactly like you expect they would with respect to the algebraic operations of addition subtraction and multiplication here's another way to see that adding vectors should be done component wise if we first rewrite the vectors in terms of the standard unit vectors our algebraic experiences strongly suggest that we combine like terms and that leads us to the same result as before this also helps explain why multiplication by a scalar should distribute across the components when we write this out in terms of the standard unit vector it's literally just the distributive property in three dimensions we have three standard unit vectors i j and k all of the ideas that we developed for two dimensional vectors will work with these three dimensional vectors if you can add and subtract two dimensional vectors you can probably figure out how to add and subtract three dimensional vectors you can probably also figure out how to multiply a scalar by three dimensional vectors there are also higher dimensional versions of this but we're not going to go there in this class you might have noticed that we didn't talk about division by a vector it turns out that you will never divide by a vector we also didn't talk about multiplying two vectors together that one turns out to be a more complicated idea that we'll have to wait for another section in the next video we're going to pick up the idea of the algebraic properties of vectors and investigate the magnitude of factors every time vectors are taught math professors are obligated to point out that there's a list of algebraic properties of vector operations these are important because they point to some of the foundations of algebra and place the entire framework of vectors inside a larger narrative of how we do algebra if you go on to take upper division courses in mathematics you will almost certainly run into these again they are very useful in formal proofs and derivations but at this level i think the outcome for most students is just to remind you of the names of certain algebraic properties and recognize how these rules reflect the standard rules of algebra that you already have in your experiences in the previous video we hinted a bit at these by using your algebraic experiences to do some vector manipulations this section formalizes all of that into a list of properties we will go over them briefly and not get bogged down in the proofs and the details the first two are the commutative and associative properties of addition these should be very familiar the third is the existence of a zero vector that functions as the additive identity the fourth defines the additive inverse you may not recognize these in this form but they are reflection of some of the basic properties of real numbers notice how the vector arrow above the zero vector distinguishes it from the number zero the next two are distributive properties but notice that one is the distributive properties of vectors over scalars and one is the distributive property of scalars over vectors although they look similar these two distributive properties are slightly different from each other because they operate on different types of objects then we have a property that looks like the associative property of multiplication except it's technically slightly different because it's a product of two scalars and a vector not the product of three scalars the last one is the multiplicative identity property for the scalar one you can actually prove all of these by writing out generic vectors in component notation and using componentwise manipulations the key fact is that once you're working with a specific component you're just doing arithmetic with real numbers so that the properties of real numbers apply but we're going to leave those as exercises if you intend to go on to take more upper division math courses these are exercises that are important for you to understand because it will help to develop your intuition and experience for proof writing the important thing is not the algebraic manipulation per se but that you understand what you're trying to accomplish with those manipulations and how you actually do it when we introduced the idea of vectors by using arrows we said that the magnitude of a vector is its length but we never talked about how you would actually compute the length fortunately we have the pythagorean theorem to help us if we draw a vector we can form a right triangle out of it where the legs are parallel to the axes and the vector itself is the hypotenuse the length of these legs correspond to the component form of the vector then we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse for the pythagorean theorem this gives us a formula for the magnitude of a vector if we had three dimensions the formula would generalize how you might expect these formulas should remind you of the distance formula which could also be used to find the magnitude of these vectors if you are given the coordinates of the tip and the tail there is a special category of vectors called unit vectors a unit vector is a vector of length 1. unsurprisingly the standard unit vectors happen to have length 1 but they aren't the only ones there is a unit vector pointing in every direction and the same is true in three dimensions an important calculation is to find the unit vector that points in the same direction as some given vector if you are given a vector v and you want to find the unit vector that points in the same direction you need to scale the vector by the appropriate value so that it has unit length that scaling factor turns out to be 1 over the magnitude of v this makes intuitive sense if you think of a few examples if you have a vector of length 3 how much do you need to shrink it by to make it half length one it must shrink down by a third or by one over three and that's the basic idea there's an algebraic derivation of this that comes from proving that the magnitude of k times v is equal to the absolute value of k times the magnitude of v but that's part of one of the activities and so it's better for you to work that one out for yourself it's important to have a solid foundation in these basic vector manipulations because we're going to use them throughout the course it turns out that there are several ways to define multiplication between vectors in this section we're going to discuss the dot product we'll begin with the definition definition the dot product of the vectors u and v in rn is a scalar quantity u dot v is equal to u1 v1 plus u2 v2 plus dot dot dot plus unvn at this point this is just a formula we'll talk about how to interpret the values soon for now we just want to make sure that you know how to do the calculation notice that we are taking the product of the corresponding vector components and then adding the results together so if we calculate one two four dot negative two three zero we would get one times negative two plus 2 times 3 plus 4 times 0 which is 4. notice that the output of this is a scalar for this reason this is sometimes called a scalar product the dot product satisfies certain properties we won't go through the proofs carefully in this video because it's just plugging things into the formula and doing a little algebra if u v and w are vectors in r n then the dot product is commutative it distributes over vector addition and the dot product has a property that looks similar to the associative property but technically isn't just as with the previous section these properties point to some foundational concepts that are useful in proofs and derivations but we're not going to spend time discussing them in the abstract however there is one property of the dot product that we will discuss in detail it turns out that the dot product of a vector with itself is an important quantity let's look at the dot product of a twodimensional vector with itself after writing it out we get a result that should seem familiar you might recognize this as the square of the magnitude this property holds true in general the dot product of a vector with itself will always give you the square of the magnitude of the vector this fact is used very frequently when working with vectors especially in proofs and derivations so it is important to have this fact at your fingertips now that we have a few facts about the dot product let's take a look at what it means the best way to do this is through the derivation of a geometric property of the dot product if we have two vectors with their tails together they will form an angle that is between 0 and 180 degrees we'll call that angle theta by connecting the tips of the vectors we create a triangle we'll leave it as an exercise to convince yourself that the third side of the triangle is the vector u minus v if we draw the arrow from the tip of v to the tip of u now we have a triangle with all three sides and one angle labeled this is a situation where we can apply the law of cosines the law of cosines uses the squares of the lengths of the sides which we can rewrite using the dot product notice that in the difference term we have to use the distributive and commutative properties of the dot product to move forward from here we can do some canceling and rearranging to simplify the equation you can pause and look at the details or find the details in the book but they're not difficult manipulations it's just following the algebra in the end you get this formula the dot product of the vectors is equal to the product of the length of the vectors multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them this is often written in two other forms solving for either the cosine of the angle or the angle itself this shows us that the dot product is related to the angle between the vectors and we even get an explicit formula for the angle it's important to remember that this is the formula for the angle between the vectors when they are drawn with their tails together there are many errors that can result from not checking that let's take a closer look at the dot product formula notice that if the angle is pi over 2 then the dot product is going to be zero in other words if the vectors form a right angle with each other then the dot product is zero there's a special term we use for this two vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other if their dot product is zero for this class we can use the words orthogonal and perpendicular interchangeably but there are other applications of vectors for which the word perpendicular ends up being geometrically confusing and so the preference when working with vectors is to use the word orthogonal when the dot product is zero we can actually discover more about the dot product from this formula by thinking about the behavior of the cosine function for different angles notice that if the angle is acute then the cosine is positive which then means that the dot product is positive if the angle is obtuse then the cosine is negative and the dot product is negative this means that the sign of the dot product tells us whether the angle between the vectors is an acute angle a right angle or an obtuse angle this is a useful algebraic tool to have when thinking about the geometry of vectors for the next video we're going to look at some applications of the dot product one of the more practical applications of vector concepts is in the study of physics students often lose sight of the fact that newton invented calculus in the process of trying to understand physical motion so we will be taking a short tangent into physics to see how these ideas can be applied specifically we're going to explore the concept of work there are two vector quantities that are relevant to this topic displacement and force remember that displacement is the relative motion of an object when we were adding vectors we thought of the sum of vectors as indicating one movement followed by another movement those movements are displacements notice that they have both a magnitude and a direction the idea of a force is a push or pull applied to an object when you bring magnets together they generate a force that either tries to pull them together or push them apart depending on the polarity gravity is a force that pulls objects together notice that forces are also vector quantities because there's a magnitude and a direction as you bring magnets together the direction of the force on each magnet is either towards or away from each other and the force gets larger as they get closer together it should hopefully make intuitive sense that applying a force to an object can lead to its displacement work is a measure of the energy used when applying a force to displace an object as we are applying the force to the object we are causing the object to move and the work is the conversion of the applied force to the kinetic energy of the object there's obviously a whole lot more we can say about this but that's the extent of the intuition that we're going to develop for this course because we were going to consider only very basic cases the formula for work turns out to be a dot product work is force dot displacement once again notice the vector symbols over f and d but not w work is a scalar quantity the reason for the dot product is related to the fact that only the part of the force in the direction of motion counts as far as energy transfer is concerned if we are pushing a cart along a track we do a better job of putting energy into the cart if we push parallel to the track instead of at an angle the more the force aligns with the motion the more energy is transferred when solving one of these work problems you will want to draw a picture to help identify the force and the displacement from there just take the dot product of the vectors depending on the problem you will either use the geometric formula or the componentwise algebraic formula a common error that students make is that they do not put the tails of the vectors together when they calculate the angle the activity for this section provides a little bit more insight into the concept of work so you should definitely take the time to think about that one let's take another look at pushing the block around the track but pushing at an angle if we think about it the only part of our force that is doing any work is the part that's parallel to the track there's another part of our force that is perpendicular to the track and it's doing nothing useful at all and this hints at the usefulness of breaking a vector down into two separate pieces that reflect the underlying problem where those two pieces are either parallel or perpendicular to a specific direction in this problem we're looking at the direction of motion but this can apply to any direction that's relevant to the problem the projection of the vector u onto v is the part of u that points in the direction of v here's a diagram that indicates how the projection is determined and we'll look at the details of this briefly the notation is slightly cumbersome but it is a fairly common notation notice that the vector we project onto is a small subscript to the proj we've put a vector arrow over this because it's a vector very few books do that and it honestly looks kind of ugly but i think the emphasis is more important than the aesthetics for the part that is perpendicular we use this notation you might remember this symbol from a geometry class and represents perpendicularity so this is the projection of u onto the direction perpendicular to v and this quantity is also a vector so it also has a vector arrow the geometry of a projection can sometimes be difficult for students to visualize and draw so we're going to describe it in a very prescriptive way that helps to avoid errors and do a couple examples when drawing the vector projection of u onto v first draw the two vectors with their tails together if you can draw v a little bit lightly so that it doesn't become a distraction later then extend the vector v into a line draw a line from the tip of u to the line you just drew so that the two parts are perpendicular to each other the projection of u onto v is the vector that points from the tails to the point of intersection here are some pairs of vectors u and v you should pause the video and see if you can visualize how to construct the projection of u onto v for each pair in each of these cases you're starting off with step one already done for you extend the vector v into a line find the correct perpendicular and use the intersection point to create the projection here are the results notice that in some cases the projection vector points in the opposite direction of v also notice that one pair has labels u and v swapped and they give different results this emphasizes the importance of knowing which vector you're projecting onto which the reason i teach students to draw the line through v is because some students turn their pictures into triangles by connecting the tip of u to the tip of v and that leads to problems it also deals with the case when you and v point in opposite directions which is also a source of confusion by drawing the extension explicitly i have found that students make those errors much less often the derivation of the formula is in the book and you're encouraged to work through that yourself it's just a quick exercise in applying the properties of the dot product there's another way of writing this vector that provides a little more insight notice that in this second form we have written it as a product of a scalar and a unit vector in the direction of v the scalar is called the component of u in the direction of v notice that if the component is negative then the projection points in the opposite direction of v lastly we can get the perpendicular projection by manipulating the definition and making a substitution i find it's much easier to think of this relationship in solving for the perpendicular projection rather than memorizing the final formula as a general rule i recommend against memorizing formulas because they often do not increase your level of understanding and you won't know that you don't understand until several sections down the line and at that point you're stuck trying to play catchup vector projections are important for multivariable calculus so it is important that you are conceptually and computationally fluid with them make sure you take the time to do the exercises in the book to make sure that you're where you need to be with this topic the cross product is the second of two different types of vector products that we have in multivariable calculus unlike the dot product the result of a cross product is a vector and not a scalar we also only define the cross product for three dimensional vectors there is a way to generalize this to higher dimensions but that goes beyond this course the book introduces the cross product on the standard unit vectors in r3 the key fact is that we use the right hand rule on a righthanded coordinate system to derive these values the first term of the cross product is the index finger the second term is the middle finger and the result is the thumb if we swap the order then we have to turn our hand upside down to swap the positions of our index and middle finger when taking the cross product of two different standard unit vectors the result will always be plus or minus the third the results listed here are in a slightly different arrangement than the book because i wanted to point out a pattern all the positive results come from taking the letters in the cyclic pattern i j k i cross j equals k j cross k equals i and k cross i equals j all the negative results come from going in the reverse order and so if you just remember that cyclic alphabetical order gives positive values and reverse cyclic alphabetical order gives negative values you have a much easier time remembering the results if we use the distributive property and these formulas we can come up with a general formula for the cross product the calculation is just algebra and these formulas and the book has worked it out in detail for you we're going to jump straight to the result definition the cross product u cross v of the vectors u and v and r 3 is the formula u 2 v 3 minus u 3 v 2 i minus u 1 v 3 minus u 3 v 1 j plus u 1 v 2 minus u 2 v 1 k the formula looks messy and in this form students often overlook the negative sign in front of the middle term there are matrix formulations of this that are much easier to remember notice that in the bottom form the middle row is the first vector and the bottom row is the second vector if you haven't worked with determinants before it's okay to think of these as just the special notation for a specific calculation we're going to skip ahead and talk about the physics concept of torque in order to build up further insight before talking about the geometry of the cross product torque can be thought of as a twisting force that is trying to cause something to rotate imagine that you're trying to tighten a bolt with a wrench where would you want to push on the wrench to make sure it's tight if you have any experience with this you would almost instinctively push further away from the bolt this shows that torque depends on both the force you apply as well as where you apply it but it also depends on the angle that you're applying the force if you're pushing inward or outward you're applying an unhelpful force this is similar to pushing in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion in a work problem the amount of torque you get is dependent upon those three factors the size of the force you're applying the angle at which you're applying the force and the location that the force is being applied here is the formula for torque in this formula the fancy t is the greek letter tau and that stands for the torque r is a vector that points from the axis of rotation to where the force is being applied and f is the applied force since the cross product is a vector quantity we have put a vector symbol over tau be careful that when you're computing the cross product that you put the tails together it is very common for students to just use vectors in the diagram without paying attention to this and this can lead to getting the direction wrong i want to take a moment to point out the differences in the book so that you know where they are the book uses torque is equal to f cross r instead of r across f in the book's diagram the vector r is backwards from the convention pointing from the place the force is being applied back to the axis of rotation it turns out that these two differences cancel each other out and the curious student may want to think about how they might verify that for themselves the third difference is that the angle theta is not the conventional angle between vectors which is the angle formed when the tails are put together for various formulas involving the sine of this angle it turns out it doesn't matter and you'll get the same result by following the book's presentation so there's nothing mathematically wrong with the book it's just different from the physics conventions similar to the work problems with dot products we're only going to look at the most basic applications so at some level it doesn't even matter which way you do it if you do look up more information and go deeper into the topic you're likely to see other formulas for torque here are just some possibilities the first equation is the standard version for physics using vectors the second equation involves a concept known as the lever arm or the moment arm we're not going to define it here because it's not relevant to this class but you should be careful because this value may not be what you might intuitively guess it is so be extra careful with that one the third one is actually related to something we're going to see in the next video which is why i'm including it here for this class we care about the vector form the most because we're getting practice with vector calculations an interesting conceptual piece of this is that the direction of torque corresponds to tightening or loosening screws most of the screws you interact with are righthanded screws if you're familiar with rightytighty and leftyloosey that's a righthanded rule if you are tightening a screw the torque points inward and if you're loosening the screw the torque points outward you will sometimes see these symbols for vectors pointing directly in or directly out of the page you should think of the cross as the fletching of an arrow which are the feathers or plastic parts on the tail end and this dot should be thought of as the tip of the arrow pointing out at you it's important to know that there are lefthanded screws and threads that do the opposite of this so it isn't some rule that all threads have to behave this way but the overwhelming majority of the screws that you will run into are designed like this in the next video we're going to take a look at the geometry of the cross product the cross product was defined to be a vector remember that vectors are quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction we're going to start by looking at the magnitude the algebra for this is neither pretty nor insightful but fortunately the book shows you all the steps we're going to go straight to the result the magnitude of u cross v is equal to the length of u times the length of v times the sine of the angle between them again the angle between vectors is defined to be the angle created when the tails are put together we're going to focus on the consequences of this formula the first thing to notice is that if we combine the length of v and sine of theta into a single term we end up with something geometric if we draw out the vectors like this it turns out that the length of v times sine theta gives you the distance from the tip of v to the line formed by u the same thing works if we combine the length of u with sine of theta instead if this feels kind of like what we do with vector projections that's because it is similar to vector projection the difference is that with vector projections we usually didn't have the angle theta in hand and so we would have to use the dot product to go get it and that would end up being a bunch of extra steps but there are definitely some geometric relationships here that are interesting to explore but back to the cross product if we draw out the parallelogram formed by the vectors u and v we can see that the length of the cross product corresponds to the area of the parallelogram we're going to use this fact much later in class so don't lose track of this relationship we can also draw a triangle by connecting the tips of the vectors and the area of this triangle is half the length of the cross product because it's half the area of the parallelogram this will be helpful when working through some of the exercises there's a special case of the area picture which is when the two vectors are parallel to each other we can think of this as the area of the parallelogram collapsing to zero which would make the magnitude of the cross product equal to zero students sometimes get worried when they get a zero because they think they did something wrong getting a zero here does not automatically mean you made a mistake it just means that the vectors are parallel so now that we know about the magnitude of the cross product what about its direction it turns out that if you calculate u dot u cross v and v dot u cross v you will get zero the book shows the details of this calculation if the dot product of two vectors is zero then the vectors are perpendicular this means that u cross v is perpendicular to both u and v notice that if u and v are not parallel to each other then together they define a plane there are only two directions that are perpendicular to the plane and the correct one is the one that follows the right hand rule try to match your hand to this diagram point the index finger of your right hand to the right and point your middle finger at the screen then your thumb should match the black vector if the vectors are parallel to each other then the cross product is zero from the previous section we know that the magnitude of the cross product of parallel vectors will be zero and so that makes the direction irrelevant but with this new perspective we can see that two parallel vectors don't even form a plane so it doesn't make sense that there would be one particular direction for the cross product to point the result is simply that you get the zero vector it's sometimes the case that we use the vector n to talk about a vector that's perpendicular to the surface n stands for normal which in this context just means perpendicular to the surface the vector n is usually a unit vector so you often hear it referred to as the unit normal vector and so with this we get another formula for the cross product the vector n is implied to be the normal to the plane formed by u and v following the right hand rule notice that this formula isn't saying much more than the previous formula the normal vector is just saying what direction the cross product points and the length of the same value we saw earlier but the addition of this direction does create a threedimensional picture for us that we didn't have when we were just looking at the magnitude with two vectors we can form a parallelogram notice that this is a flat object with a third vector we can get a volume by branching out into the third dimension the use of three vectors forms a parallel pipette this is just the natural generalization of a parallelogram it can be thought of as a box with slanted sides we can calculate the volume of a parallel pipette by using the cross product and the dot product together the volume of the parallel pipet formed by the vectors u v and w is the absolute value of u cross v dot w we won't go into the details but the idea is that the u cross v part gives us the area of the parallelogram that makes the base and then the dot product of the unit normal vector with w gives us the height while this formula is useful and uses the concepts and formulas of the last couple sections it's not important to this class so it's probably not one that's worth memorizing even though it's not a difficult one to remember if you bump into an application of it down the line you can always look it up then the book has a brief section that talks about the similarities and differences between the dot product and the cross product it's worth thinking through this to help the ideas sink in more deeply the dot product results in a scalar and the cross product results in a vector the dot product is commutative but the cross product is not technically we would say that the cross product is anticommutative or skew commutative because you get the negative result when you swap the order the dot product is related to the cosine of the angle between the vectors and the cross product is related to the sine of the angle between the vectors we can see that these formulas are otherwise very similar to each other if the dot product is zero then the vectors are orthogonal to each other if the cross product is zero then the vectors are parallel to each other recognizing these four properties helps us to see how these two products are both similar and different you will want to be very familiar with all of these properties as we continue expanding our perspective of threedimensional space it makes sense that we should spend some time thinking about some basic shapes one of the most basic shapes to work with is a line in two dimensions we often represented the equation of a line using slopeintercept form if we think about graphing a line from this equation the intercept gives us a starting position and the slope gives us a direction while it may seem simple this framework turns out to be useful for thinking about lines in three dimensions we'll begin by looking at the definition definition a line in space is the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point p that are parallel to a fixed vector v at first this may feel nothing like what we just did but a picture will be helpful here's a point p and a vector v we want to draw the terminal points of all vectors that emanate from p that are parallel to v here are some examples we should also include vectors that are parallel but point in the opposite direction notice how all these points form a line and that this line is parallel to v for this reason v is called a direction vector if we wanted to describe how to get to any of these points starting from the origin we would first have to move to the point p and then move by some scalar multiple of v and this is exactly the vector form of a line notice that there are multiple representations of a line we can change the point p to any other point on the line or we can change the length of v or have it point in the opposite direction so the equations of lines are not unique the vector form of a line is called that because it's written as a vector equation if we wanted to look at the individual components of a vector we would have a set of parametric equations for the line both representations carry the same information so the only difference is in how they look we'll start with the vector equation we're going to write this in terms of components the vector r of t is a function with three components which we will call x of t y of t and z of t notice that each coordinate is itself a function of t since all the coordinates are subject to change if we change the value of t we can call the starting position vector x naught y naught z naught and the direction vector abc by plugging this in and doing some algebra we get this equation remember that two vectors are equal when each of their corresponding components are equal so we can turn this one vector equation into three equations the collection of these equations is called the parametric equations of a line the three equations come together as a package so that the whole collection represents the line and not any individual part notice that if we have the parametric equations of the line we can put them back together into a vector to get a vector equation so they really are the same thing we're going to spend a moment to look at the general idea of parametric equations parametric equations are equations that are related to each other through external variables called parameters a line is a collection of coordinates using the variables x y and z the external variable for these equations is t the idea is that this one variable controls the three coordinate variables for every real number t you get a point on the line for example when t equals zero you get the point x naught y naught z naught as t increases we move further along the line in the direction of v as t decreases we move along the line in the opposite direction of v in some sense the parameter t controls where along the line your point is located in fact if we vary t smoothly we would trace out the entire line in lots of applications we think of t equals 0 as the starting time of some activity so it should not be confusing to think of x not y naught z naught as the starting point continuing along with the time analogy as time increases we can imagine ourselves walking along the line at a constant speed in the direction of v for negative values we simply think of that as winding time backwards and think about where we would have been had we've been traveling along the line at a constant speed before t equals 0. the line itself is the set of all points that we visit along this path when we think about the intersection of lines we think about whether the two paths intersect not whether the people moving along those lines actually get to meet each other we use two different parameters when talking about two different lines to remind us that the parameters are independent of each other so for the first line we may be at the intersection at t equals one and for the second line we may be at the intersection at s equals two and we would still say that the two lines intersect each other in some situations you will need to find the equation of a line just remember that you need to identify a point on the line and a direction vector the exact method you use to find those will vary from problem to problem it can be helpful to sketch a picture sometimes to help visualize the situation but in the end you just need two pieces of information a point on the line and a direction vector in the next video we're going to take a look at the next step up from lines in three dimensions and try to understand how to describe planes in three dimensions the definition of a plane that we're going to use looks very similar to the definition of a line we're going to put the definition side by side to show the similarities and talk a little bit about mathematical language before taking a deeper look at planes themselves a line in space is the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point p that are parallel to a fixed vector v a plane in space is the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point p0 that are perpendicular to a fixed vector n as you get further along in math definitions become more and more important as the foundation of how you think about things it's very important that our definitions are as precise as possible so that the rest of our ideas can also be as precise as possible when you think about definitions in this way you can start to get a sense of the flow of the language which not only helps you to think about definitions but also theorems and proofs the first line is stating the name of the object being defined the second line describes the type of object that is being defined in this case it's a set of terminal points of vectors the remainder is a set of descriptive phrases that describe the property of the object being defined what do we know about these vectors they emanate from some point and have some relationship with another vector understanding this framework will help you organize the information in your head to make it easier to remember and less prone to error and that can be very helpful in being successful in a math course but at this specific moment it's probably not of central importance that you make this connection as you keep studying math you will find that it's useful to slow down and make sure you're starting to catch some of these higher level patterns in how we do math as it will help you understand what's happening at a deeper level but for now we'll return to thinking about the definition of a plane definition a plane p in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point p0 perpendicular to a fixed vector n let's start with the point p 0 and draw the vector n emanating from it technically n can be anywhere but the picture is simplest to visualize if we draw it this way let's think about all the other vectors that emanate from p0 that are perpendicular to n and plot their terminal points for example there are a bunch of points in this direction and we can actually think about this as an entire line of points we can then imagine rotating this line around the vector n to get another line in a slightly different direction in fact we can keep on rotating this all the way around and as we do this you can see that a plane is being created to get from the picture to the formula we're going to use the fact that the dot product of two vectors is zero when those vectors are orthogonal to each other we are given the vector n which we will write as a b c and we need to get the vector that points from p zero to some point p on this plane we will call the coordinate of p 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and a generic point p on the plane x y z remember to get the vector from one point to another we need to subtract the coordinates so the vector p 0 to p is x minus x naught y minus y naught z minus z naught we then substitute and take the dot product which gives us an equation of the plane we call this final version the scalar equation of the plane and we call the original vector form the vector equation of the plane this is similar to the parametric form of a line and the vector form of a line in that they are both representations of the same thing the conversion backwards from the scalar equation is bit more complex this time but if you remind yourself that it's a dot product you should be able to learn to recognize it just as we often need to find the equation of a line we're going to need to find the equation of a plane and similar to finding the equation of a line to get the equation of a plane you need two pieces of information a point on the plane and a normal vector to the plane there are lots of different ways to get those two pieces but those are the two pieces you need to be looking for a common example of this is determining the equation of a plane that passes through three noncollinear points what's interesting about this problem is just how many different ways you can do it all you need is a point on the plane and the normal vector you start off with three points on the plane and it doesn't matter which one you pick because they're all on the plane so just pick one and move on to the normal vector how can we get a normal vector to the plane by taking the cross product of any two vectors that lie on that plane this is because the cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both of the vectors you started with with these three points you can make six different vectors that lie in the plane pq pr qp qr rp and rq and as long as you pick two that aren't parallel to each other you can take the cross product to get a normal vector once you make these calculations you just plug it into the formula the book has an exercise where you do this and you should take the time to go through it this section was relatively short and conceptually simple however we're going to come back to these basic skills of finding lines and planes often in this course so you want to take the time to really understand the ideas that we've discussed earlier we saw how we could get the equation of a line in space by using vectors we had one vector to move to a starting point and then we had a direction vector that was scaled by parameter t that moved us to some other location along the line the idea of using the terminal point of a vector to plot a curve is what we're going to explore in this section when we were graphing lines we thought of it as walking along a straight line path at a fixed speed but it doesn't have to be this way for a general curve the path we travel can go in different directions and can move at different speeds we will still maintain the idea that for every value of t we're in a specific location and that this location is the terminal point of some vector in standard position in the abstract this idea is just having each of the three coordinates being a function of t for any given t we have an x coordinate a y coordinate and a z coordinate the equations for these coordinates are called parametric equations and we would say that we have a parametrization of the curve we can put the whole thing into a vector r so that r of t is equal to x of t y of t z of t this would give us a vectorvalued function the input is a number t and the output is a threedimensional vector alternatively we can keep the equation separate and have parametric equations here are the formal definitions for these ideas definition a vectorvalued function is a function whose input is a real parameter t and whose output is a vector that depends on t the graph of a vectorvalued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin parametric equations for a curve are equations of the form x equals x of t y equals y of t and z equals z of t that describe the xyz coordinates of a point of a curve in r3 notice that the set of parametric equations automatically gives us a vectorvalued function and that a vectorvalued function can be turned into a set of parametric equations when we are looking at parametric equations it's important to recognize they have both the shape of the curve and also how we traverse the curve even for a curve as simple as a circle we can have a number of different starting points we can go in different directions and we could go at different speeds activity 9.6.2 explores this idea more deeply and in the next section we're also going to look at the concepts of the velocity and the acceleration of a particle moving along a path given by a set of parametric equations but for now it's enough to know that it's not just the shape of the curve but also how you travel along it it is helpful to introduce parametric equations because it gives us access to a wider collection of curves than functions you might recall using the vertical line test to determine whether graph is a function the idea is that we're using the xcoordinate as the input of the function and that for each input we can only have one output when we're using parametric equations that is not a problem this is because we're not using the x coordinate as the input but some parameter t this also means that we can have curves that selfintersect and this still isn't a problem if we wanted we could take a function of the form y equals f of x and turn it into a vector function t f of t this is really just a different way of notating the coordinates of a position on the graph as a vector instead of as a point as a side note some students write x f x instead of introducing a parameter this is a problematic notation the problem is that we are using the same symbol for two different things if you look at the graph on the left the idea becomes more clear if we actually label the axes we can now see that x is trying to perform two different functions and it can be confusing in general we try to avoid using the same symbol to represent two ideas at the same time traces and level curves are two examples of curves that we can convert to vector functions just as before these curves can help us to understand the shape of a surface here's the formal definition again as a reminder given a function z equals f of x y we can get a trace by fixing one of the independent variables to be constant notice that if we do this then the function z becomes a function of a single variable which we can then convert into a vector function and remember that if we have a vector function we also get a set of parametric equations level curves are more difficult because you may have to identify the parametric equations yourself this will take some time and practice but the problems at this level are not too difficult if your curve is a line or a function of a single variable then you can use the ideas that we've already seen the other important curve you'll need to recognize is a circle the most common twovariable parametrization of a circle of radius a is r of t is equal to a cosine t a sine t for t between 0 and 2 pi this travels once around the circle starting from the positive x axis and moving in the counterclockwise direction although this is a twodimensional curve it can be converted into a threedimensional curve in several ways for example if we picked a fixed z value such as k then we would be plotting the circle of radius a at height k but there's much more you can do with this for example the circle of radius a on the y z plane can be obtained by setting the x coordinate to zero and picking the y and z coordinates to be the sine and cosine terms if you wanted to translate the center to a different position you could just add or subtract constants as appropriate but these are all just adjustments to a basic picture again this takes a little bit of time and practice you shouldn't expect to understand this by just watching a quick video you may find it helpful to play around with some online parametric graphing tools to help you get a little more intuition with this let's do a quick review of the derivative from single variable calculus the goal is to find the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a specific point the problem is that we need two points to apply the slope formula and this only gives us one so we get at it by taking a second point on the curve and using that as an approximation to the tangent then bring those points closer and closer together we called that process a limit and that's what gave us the formula for the derivative of a function when transitioning to vectorvalued function the formula doesn't change very much definition the derivative of a vector function r is defined to be this formula for the values of t at which the limit exists we also use the notation dr dt and ddt of r of t for r prime of t we will look at the computational consequences of this formula later for now we'll focus on the geometry of the formula the vector r of t plus h minus r of t is the vector that points from r of t to r of t plus h so the derivative captures the direction of movement between these points remember that this is being divided by h for small values of h so this will stretch out the vector beyond those two points and we're taking the limit as h goes to zero just as before which is bringing us closer to the tangent vector and that is exactly what the derivative of a vectorvalued function represents the derivative is the tangent vector to the path since physics is one of the main applications of vector calculus we're going to do a quick review in physics we can talk about the position of an object by using a vector the idea of velocity is how quickly your position is changing with respect to time so the derivative of position is velocity acceleration is the change of velocity intuitively if you're speeding up then your velocity is increasing and if you're slowing down then your velocity is decreasing speeding up and slowing down are accelerations and acceleration is the derivative of velocity it's very important to remember that position velocity and acceleration are all vectors in this context they have both a magnitude and a direction this is different from speed which is the magnitude of the velocity vector and it is a scalar quantity you need to be careful with these as it is common for people to use velocity and speed interchangeably depending on the specific context so just be aware that you will have to pay attention to the situation and not blindly rely on formulas to get yourself through the formula that we saw earlier shows that the derivative of a vector valued function is calculated component wise the logic for this is much easier to see if we write the vector r using standard unit vectors if r of t is equal to x of t i plus y of t j plus c of t k then the derivative is x prime of t i plus y prime of t j plus z prime of t k for those values of t at which x y and z are differentiable this should be intuitively true if you just notice that the vectors i j and k are constants with that observation the x y and z functions are just being multiplied by a constant and those constants can be pulled out when taking the derivative and if you look at the formal derivation in the book that's exactly what happens because of this the properties of the derivatives of vector functions will feel very familiar the derivative of a sum of vectors is the sum of their derivatives this is exactly the same thing as we saw in single variable calculus the derivatives of products work out to behave like the product rule even when taking derivatives of dot products and cross products the reason for this is that if you look at the formulas for the dot product and the cross product you will see that you end up with the sum of a bunch of terms that are just the product of two functions at a time and that's where the standard product rule shows up to create the pattern in the final results that we see here with the chain rule the standard unit vectors can be pulled out and you're left with the chain rule for single variable calculus you really ought to take the time to prove these for yourself just start by writing r as the sum of its components with the corresponding unit vectors and see where the manipulation takes you this usually feels a bit clumsy at first and that's just from a lack of experience the best way to get experience is to do the calculation yourself and see how the pieces come together one of the big applications of single variable calculus is finding the tangent line to curves let's review if we graph the function y equals f of x we get a curve if we pick a specific value of x say x equals a then we can plug that in to get a point along the graph the derivative at that point gives us the slope of the line to get the full equation of the line we start from the point slope form and plug in the values and after a couple algebra steps we get the equation of the tangent line the book causes l of x and is often called the linear approximation of f at a we can do the same thing to curves in three dimensions remember that we need two pieces of information to get the equation of a line a point and a direction if we pick some specific value of the parameter say t equals a that will give us the location of a point on the curve and then we can use the derivative of the vector function to give us the direction vector instead of using point slope form which only applies to lines in the plane we use the vector form of the line we're using the parameter s instead of t for now to emphasize the idea that the parametrization of the tangent line can be done independent of the parametrization of the curve we can plug in the point and the direction vector and that gives us a parametrization of the tangent line in this form setting s equals zero gives us the point on the curve and there are many situations where this is useful however there are times when it's more useful to parametrize the curve so that s equals a gives us the point on the curve which requires a slightly altered parametrization in some ways this is the more intuitive result because it means that the parametrization of the tangent line makes it so that the curve and the tangent are parameterized to meet up exactly at the point of tangency notice that this second form looks a lot more like the equation for the tangent line from single variable calculus which is another reason why this form is often preferred in the next video we're going to take a look at integrating vector functions and look at some more physics in the previous video we talked about taking derivatives of vector functions the natural followup to that is integrating vector functions recall that integrals and derivatives are basically inverse operations of each other one way to say this is that if capital f prime of x equals little f of x then capital f of x is the integral of f of x dx plus c for some constant c while integration can be interpreted as the area under a curve it will be better for the moment to think of it as the antiderivative it's just a function that has this special derivative property the concept of area doesn't quite extend to vector functions in a simple analogous way but with that caveat in place here's the definition definition an antiderivative of a vectorvalued function little r is a vectorvalued function capital r such that capital r prime of t is equal to little r of t the indefinite integral of little r of t is the general antiderivative of little r and represents the collection of all antiderivatives of little r the last part of this statement is a reference to the constant of integration which will also appear when integrating vector functions there is not a single antiderivative but an entire family of them just with derivatives integrals are performed component wise the logic is the same as the standard unit vectors can be factored out of the integrals the key difference to notice compared to single variable calculus is that the integration constant is a vector which means it will have three components in other words since there are three separate integrals you will get three separate constants of integration corresponding with each dimension the most important application of derivatives and antiderivatives is in the relationship between position velocity and acceleration earlier we talked about how you can start from the position vector of an object take its derivative to calculate the velocity and then take the derivative again to calculate the acceleration antiderivatives allow us to undo this pattern if we're given acceleration we can integrate it to get velocity up to a constant and then integrate it again to get position up to another constant these constants are often called initial conditions with any one of these vectors and the right number of conditions we are able to calculate all the others we are going to apply these ideas to the problem of projectile motion this is the theoretical motion of an object that is launched under the influence of gravity what does this mean here's how we're going to set up the problem we are going to work in two dimensions with x being horizontal and y being vertical the object is launched from the position x0 y0 the initial speed is v0 and the object is launched with an angle theta with the horizontal the acceleration is the vector 0 negative g notice that this is saying that gravity is pulling in the negative y direction we're going to ignore all the forces except for gravity so there's no friction and there's no wind this is a lot of little pieces of information so we'll start by making a quick diagram of this to guide us as we work through the problem we are in two dimensions the object is launched from the position x0 y0 the object is launched at a speed v 0 at an angle theta with the horizontal the acceleration is 0 negative g since we know the acceleration we can integrate that to get velocity notice that we need to solve for the constants of integration which we have called v zero x and v zero y to do this we draw a right triangle with the initial velocity so that we can get the x and y components of it we can plug this in to get the full equation for velocity then we can integrate this to get position notice that theta is a constant so the sine and cosine terms are just constants with respect to t it turns out that once you integrate and solve for the constants you'll get this result and this result is the equation for projectile motion this is the type of calculation that you ought to be able to do on your own by that i mean you should be able to work with just these assumptions and arrive at the appropriate equation for the motion of a projectile in some ways i hope that if you have a projectile motion problem that you will be able to derive your solution from first principles rather than just plugging values into this formula i think you stand to gain so much more from the experience of working it out a few times than you do if you just jump straight to the formula and that brings us to the end of this section as always please take the time to do the exercises and make sure that you understand what's happening in this section specifically by this point you should be very comfortable with vectors vector notation and vector operations from here forward when we need to use vectors we're just going to use them without doing a big review of them this section is important not so much for the formulas that we derive but for the logic behind those formulas one of the big ideas of integration is that you have some quantity that you're trying to find and you're going to get it by adding up a bunch of really small pieces that approximate the whole thing and then take the limit as we increase the number of pieces we see this when thinking about the area under a curve we approximate the area with rectangles and then increase the number of rectangles to get better and better approximations this limiting process becomes an integral which we can think of as a sum of infinite decimal pieces it turns out that we can do this with a huge variety of objects arc length can be thought of as the distance you travel if you travel along a curve we will imagine a curve that starts at t equals a and ends at t equals b the challenge is that the distance formula only gives us the length of straight line paths so we will approximate the curve with a bunch of straight line segments and then take the limit as we increase the number of segments we're going to use a differential notation because it's more intuitive than the full formulas as written in the book let's imagine taking a close look at just one of these straight line segments even though in the initial sketch it's in two dimensions we're going to think of it as being in three dimensions so if we plot the endpoints of this particular line segment it fits inside a box with sides that we'll label dx dy and dz by applying the distance formula we know the length of this segment which we'll call dl is equal to the square root of dx squared plus dy squared plus dz squared you should think of dl as a little bit of length then the total arc length is the sum of these lengths if we look at the right side of the equation we don't have a variable of integration we also need to convert the differential terms into derivatives fortunately the parameter t saves us on both counts we can factor out a dt from under the square root which leaves us with derivative terms underneath and a dt on the outside and this is the arc length formula notice that the square root part is actually just the length of the derivative vector this gives us a more compact formula for arc length the limits of the integral are the values of t that mark the starting point and the ending point of the curve one of the challenges that we've seen with parametrizations is that there are multiple parametrizations of every curve we can change where we put the zero and we can traverse the path at any speed we want this flexibility makes it difficult because there's no standardization for how we view the curve the arc length parameter changes all of that rather than using an arbitrary value to parametrize our curve we're going to use the physical distance once we establish the location of zero then all the points are measured by the distance along that path you can imagine taking a piece of inelastic string that we label with distances and then lining up the string along the curve the markings on the string correspond to the values of the arc length parameter along the curve we can also follow this backwards to get negative values another way to think about this is that these points are mile markers along the side of a highway every unit distance the marker goes up by one to get the arc length parameter we have to define the arc length function let's say we have a parametrized curve r of t defined on the interval from a to b the arc length function s of t is defined to be the length of the curve from a to t where t is some point in the interval from a to b since we have the arc length formula we can just write that down the variable s is called the arc length parameter notice that we're using the variable w because the variables s and t have already been used up s is the arc length parameter and t is the upper limit of the integral that's how things go sometimes we just need to make sure that we're not using a symbol that has already been used for something else as long as t travels the path without ever stopping or going backwards we will get a function that's invertible if we're able to invert this function then we would get t as a function of s which we can then substitute to get the curve parameterized by the arc length parameter those last steps are often confusing in the abstract so we will outline a computational process and do a quick example the goal is to parametrize a curve by its arc length given some parametrization using a generic variable t the first step is to calculate the arc length function this will give you an equation of the form s equals something in terms of t the next step is to solve for t from this function so that you end up with the equation of the form t equals something in terms of s the last step is to just plug this into the original formulas so that your curve is parametrized with the variable s these are the steps that we're going to follow in the upcoming example let's take a look at the curve r of t is equal to five cosine t five sine t where t runs from zero to two pi you should be able to immediately recognize this as a circle of radius five but even if you don't you should be able to do the calculation anyway we simply plug this into the equation for the arc length function notice that even though this is a two dimensional vector the ideas still apply we won't talk through the details of this integration because this is an integral that you should have seen many times by now and you should be able to recognize the trip of using the pythagorean identity to simplify the radical term this gives us the equation s equals 5t the next step is to solve for t it's easy in this example but this can often be a very challenging step and then we substitute this in for the t that's in the original vector equation making sure that we also adjust the interval and this gives us the curve parameterized by the arc length parameter you may have noticed that the arc length parameter makes the equation look a bit messier on the plus side the arc length parameter has the property that the derivative of the position vector is always a vector of length one this corresponds to the idea that you're traveling at a constant speed of one unit of distance per unit time the book also works through a more complicated example in which you have to work a little bit harder to get the inverse you should take the time to work through that one on your own in the next video we're going to talk about the geometric concept of curvature the curvature of a curve is a way to measure how fast the curve is bending at any given point a straight line has zero curvature since it doesn't curve at all and a very sharp bend has a very large curvature the intuitive idea is that we're measuring how quickly we're changing direction as we travel along the curve the tension vector gives us the direction we're facing and we can look at the change of the direction of the tangent at two different times to get a sense of how fast we're changing direction but this starts to introduce some problems for us if you think about a roller coaster it's not hard to understand that the rate at which the direction changes depends on how fast you're going and how fast you're going is related to the parametrization that you've used we want the curvature to be related to the curve itself and not an arbitrary parametrization which is where the arc length parameter comes in the arc length parameter is defined by the shape of the curve and gives us the parametrization if we're moving along the curve at a constant unit speed we're going to introduce a new idea known as the unit tangent vector this is the vector that is parallel to the tangent vector that has length 1. we get this by dividing the tangent vector by its length remember that vectors are objects with both the direction and magnitude if we fix the magnitude to be 1 then the information in the vector is really just the direction in fact these vectors are sometimes referred to as direction vectors because of this in the previous section we noted that when the position is parametrized by the arc length parameter the derivative has length 1. this means that under that parametrization the derivative of position gives us the unit tangent vector since there is no forward or backwards acceleration as we move at a constant speed all of the acceleration goes into changing our direction and the curvature is the measure of how large that acceleration is since the derivative of velocity is acceleration we are interested in the magnitude of that vector and that takes us to the formal definition definition if c is a smooth space curve and s is an arc length parameter for c then the curvature of c is the length of the derivative of the unit tangent vector with respect to s the fancy looking k is the greek letter kappa the more formal way to arrive at this formula is by working directly with the rate of change of the direction the book does this derivation and you should go read that part of the section to get the full treatment this formula is great except that it requires us to have the arc length parameterization and we've seen that the arc length parameterization is sometimes difficult to calculate if we have a general parametrization then we need to do more work there are two other formulas that you can use for the curvature when you only have a general parametrization the first one is derived by applying the chain rule and it's just straightforward algebra and calculus the second one uses a more vectorbased approach there is a purely geometric interpretation of the curvature that's worth considering we know that we can approximate curves near a point using the tangent line but those aren't the only approximations we can use it turns out that a curve can be approximated near a point by using a circle we might even view this as a better approximation than a straight line because we can mimic the curviness that exists at that point there's a circle known as the oscillating circle that is the best circle to use at a point to approximate the curve the roundness of the curve and the oscillating circle perfectly match one another at the point of tangency curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the osculating circle the circle will have the property that at the point of tangency it shares the same slope and also has the same curvature arc length and curvature both have numerous applications for example on a roller coaster knowing the curvature of a turn will allow you to calculate the acceleration that will be experienced at any specific speed which tells you how fast the ride can go without injuring the riders or damaging the equipment unfortunately those things are beyond the scope of this course so we'll have to set them aside but hopefully the idea of it will motivate you to look into this a little bit more for yourself as we continue in our study of multivariable calculus we're going to once again remind you that even though we're mostly working with just two independent variables most of the ideas that we develop can easily be extended to three or more independent variables when we took derivatives of vectorvalued functions we were taking the limit of a function of a single independent variable because it was a function of a single variable we didn't really need any new calculus ideas because it still came down to the same derivative formula so although we have been working in multiple dimensions we have not done anything new with the derivative but now we want to look at derivatives of functions of two independent variables while the core concepts are going to be similar we're going to need to expand our definitions the first definition we'll expand as our concept of a limit definition given a function f of the independent variables x and y we say that f has a limit l as x y approaches a b provided that we can make f x y as close to l as we like by taking x y sufficiently close but not equal to the point a b and this is the notation that we use since you've already taken single variable calculus these ideas should be familiar you may have even encountered the formal epsilon delta definition of a limit in your previous calculus courses you can use the same formulation for this but the book sweeps that notation under the rug and we will as well the idea of being close but not equal to should remind you of graphs with removable singularities where the function looks like it's headed towards one value but when you get there the value is something else remember that this function still has a limit because we're looking at points that are close to but not equal to the destination when the limit and the value match up we say the function is continuous and that's something we'll loop back to shortly in single variable calculus there are only two sides that you can approach the limit from you're either approaching from above or below but for a function of two variables you can approach the limit from all sorts of directions furthermore you don't even have to approach from a straight line the limit must be the same every single way that you want to approach the point the power of the limit concept is that it is so stringent this makes it somewhat easy for us to show that limits do not exist all we need to do is identify two paths towards the same point that evaluate to different limits in practice you would need to write down some sort of function that defines a path towards the limit and then substitute activity 10.1.2 uses the function f of x y equals x over the square root of x squared plus y squared and asks you to consider the limit at 0 0 using straight lines of the form y equals mx the key factor is that for this function as x goes to 0 so does y this means that you can make the substitution and calculate the limit along that line in this calculation the final result ends up not being a constant but a value that depends on the slope that you picked and this means that different ways of approaching zero zero can lead to different values which means that the limit does not exist proving that a limit does exist turns out to be much more difficult the problem is that you cannot use a pathbased approach there are infinitely many different paths you can take and there's no single collection of formulas that accounts for them all the book does an example of this that you should work through although the skills that are developed won't be used anywhere else in this course the basic skills of working with inequalities and logic that are used really ought to be in your toolbox the book lists five properties of limits and while there's a lot of notation here the ideas are simple and should be familiar as long as the limits of our functions exist then there are certain properties that they follow the first one states that the limits of isolated variables are exactly what you think they should be the second is that constants can be factored out of the limit the third and fourth show that the limit respects addition subtraction and multiplication the fifth one says the same with division as long as you do not end up with division by zero these results are important because it justifies all of the algebraic manipulations we're going to perform but in practice these end up being exactly the manipulations that you've been trained to do throughout your mathematical experiences and so it's not that informative the main consequence of these properties is that for the nice functions that we're working with everything works out the way we expect they would earlier we brought up the idea of continuity a function f of a single variable is continuous at a if it satisfies three properties f of a exists the limit of f as x approaches a exists and these two values are the same looking back at the removable singularity from earlier we see that it isn't continuous because it fails at the third property the limit approaching x equals a is not the same value as the function at x equals a continuity for multivariable functions is defined in the same way definition a function f is continuous at the point a b provided that f is defined at a b the limit of f as x y approaches a b exists and the two values are the same the book goes on to list a number of continuity properties which are basically just reflections of the four limit properties from earlier in short continuous functions behave well with respect to addition subtraction multiplication and division as long as you're not dividing by zero in our applications the functions we're working with are basically all continuous our points of potential discontinuity are primarily from points that lead to division by zero these technical conversations are important at higher levels of mathematics but for this level it would be overkill the functions that we're going to be working with are nice functions and we don't have to worry too much about the pathologies recall that the trace of a function is the function we get when we fix one of the two input variables when we look at the graph of a trace we get something that ends up being a single variable function and since it's a single variable function we can apply our single variable calculus concepts to it specifically it makes sense for us to ask about the slope of a function along a trace and that idea is exactly what the partial derivative is definition the first order partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y at the point a b are given by these formulas provided that the limits exist this notation can seem like a lot but if you break it down there's not really that much to it let's look at the partial derivative with respect to x the first thing to notice is that this is a difference quotient it's the evaluation of a function at two locations divided by the distance between those two locations here's what it looks like on the x y plane we are evaluating the function at the points a b and a plus h b the point a b is in one position and a plus h b is to the right of it a distance h away if we look at what's happening on the y equals b plane we get a piece of the curve and the difference quotient is the slope of the secant line and then we're taking the limit as h goes to zero to get a derivative this is called the partial derivative with respect to x because we're only looking at how the function changes when moving in the x direction the partial derivative with respect to y is the same idea except now we're asking how the function changes if we only look at what's happening in the y direction and that is the heart of what partial derivatives are there are two notations for the partial derivative we have presented things with the subscript notation notice that we cannot just use a prime to denote the partial derivative because it doesn't indicate which derivative we're taking another notation for partial derivatives is known as the leibniz notation which is the notation that uses fractions it's written with this fancylooking d rather than a normal d to indicate that it's a partial derivative we will never use the regular d for a partial derivative when it comes to calculating partial derivatives the key factor to remember is that you're treating one of the variables as if it were a constant that comes from the fact that on the graph of traces we're fixing one of the variables to be a constant this means that if we take the partial derivative of x squared y cubed with respect to x we can factor out the y cubed part and just focus on the x squared part students sometimes make mistakes with the chain rule especially when working with exponential functions for the first few times you do these calculations i recommend you take your time and write out the derivative with the chain rule step explicitly to help avoid errors the first order partial derivatives are measures of the slope of a surface if you restrict yourself to moving in either the x or the y direction if the slope for one of the variables is positive then increasing in that variable causes the function to increase and decreasing in that variable causes the function to decrease if the slope is negative then this is the opposite way around and if the slope is 0 then there's no change the nice part about this is that it fits perfectly with your previous knowledge about slopes a more interesting question is what happens when you move in some arbitrary direction at this time we don't have any information about that situation but it's worth trying to imagine how it might work this is an idea that we're going to pursue later in this chapter sometimes you aren't given a formula for a function which means you won't be able to use your calculus formulas to calculate the derivative instead you may need to make estimates based on the given information the two situations we're going to consider are when the function is described by a chart and when the function is described through contour lines this is table 10.2.7 from the book it is a chart of the wind chill and fahrenheit as a function of wind speed and temperature let's suppose the wind speed is 15 miles per hour and the temperature is negative 10 degrees based on this chart the wind chill is negative 32 degrees which means that even though the air temperature is negative 10 degrees it feels like it's negative 32 degrees if we wanted to estimate the partial derivative with respect to v we are asking how the wind chill changes as we increase the wind speed if you look at the chart we see that the next wind speed we have is 20 miles per hour which is 5 miles per hour faster in that span of 5 miles per hour the wind chill drops by 3 degrees so the temperature drops 3 degrees for every five miles per hour of increased wind speed we can translate this into an estimate of the partial derivative the partial derivative is negative threefifths degree per mile per hour this value is the slope of the line that passes through the two points on the graph and that is the basic intuition of what it means to be a partial derivative how much does the function change if you change one of the input variables by a small amount remember that this is not an exact derivative since we're not actually taking a limit we're just making an estimate it's worth pointing out that there are multiple ways to estimate the slope the process we just completed is known as a forward difference and it's called that because we're using a forward step to estimate the slope another approach would be to use a backward difference notice that these two approaches will usually give different values you can also do a central difference which is when you use both a forward step and a backward step to estimate the slope this approach takes more information into account and will usually give a better estimate of the slope if you are working with a contour plot the idea is the same but you're going to have to work harder to get the values of the function here's the plot from the book if you wanted to evaluate the function at 0 0 you will need to observe that this point is between the contour lines of heights 3 and 4. you won't get an exact answer but if you look at the location you can see that it's a little closer to the 4 contour than the 3 contour and so maybe this is about 3.7 this is a rough estimate and that's just the nature of the problem if you wanted to estimate the partial derivative with respect to y you need to estimate the function at another point above or below it you can know that the function is exactly 4 by going down to the contour line but then you're going to have to estimate the coordinate the same thing happens if you go up to where the function is equal to 3. or you can move a distance of exactly 1 in either the positive or the negative direction but then you're going to have to estimate the value of the function there's no real way around the estimation but whatever estimate you choose to approximate the partial derivative you need to set up a difference quotient partial derivatives are a key tool for the remainder of the course please take the time to practice the computational aspects of it and think through the conceptual aspects of it to make sure that everything makes sense to you the derivative of a function is itself a function which means that we could take the derivative again in single variable calculus there's only one type of derivative so it makes sense for us to say the second derivative but as we saw in the previous section if you have a function of two variables then you have two first order partial derivatives if we were to take another derivative we would again have two choices this means that there are four secondorder partial derivatives when looking at the notation for higher order partial derivatives it's important to understand the meaning of the symbols you will notice that the two notations have the orders of the letters swapped for the same thing in the cross derivatives the key to keeping this straight is to think about how parentheses would imply the order of operations if you put parentheses around the subscript notation you'll find there's only one reasonable way to do it with leibniz notation the numerator takes some getting used to but you can look at the denominator and think about parentheses to understand the order the nice part about all of this is that if you know how to take first derivatives you know how to take second derivatives just make sure to keep track of which variables are constant at each step an even nicer fact is that for the functions that we will be working with the mixed derivatives will always be the same no matter what order you calculate them this result is known as claros theorem the key technicality is that you need the mixed partial derivatives to be continuous near the point where you're taking the derivative for all the functions we're working with in this class that will always be true however there are examples where this condition is not met and it's important to keep that in the back of your mind when working with mixed partial derivatives recall that in single variable calculus the second derivative gave concavity if the second derivative is positive the curve is concave up if the second derivative is negative it's concave down and if the second derivative is zero then we don't know what the shape is going to look like the second order partial derivatives xx and yy follow the same concept this makes sense because both partial derivatives keep the same variable fixed and so you're constrained to movement on a single plane but the mixed partial derivatives are a bit more complicated it turns out that the mixed partial derivatives give a measure of the twistiness of the graph that's not a technical term but it does convey the appropriate intuition let's take a closer look at it let's think about what f sub x sub y means the inner derivative is the partial derivative with respect to x in other words it's the slope of f in the x direction we are looking at the partial y derivative of this value which is telling us how the slope is changing when we change the value of y this can be difficult to visualize we're going to imagine a sequence of traces in the x direction we've sketched some planes in three dimensions to help you visualize what this looks like and we're going to line up those traces on top of each other we're going to fix a specific value of x say x equals a and draw the slopes of each of the traces at that point if we align these slopes with each other we can start to get a visualization of the slope changing as y increases if you imagine the slope being like a surface that you're riding on you can see that it's twisting a bit to the right as time moves forward that's the idea we met by twistiness earlier in this case the slope is decreasing as we move forward so f sub x y is less than zero and the larger the value is the faster we're twisting this is a quick visualization of the second derivative we'll leave it as an interesting mental exercise to think about what's happening in the other direction with f sub y x and in particular why these two values are the same if things are nice and continuous these pictures tend to be easier for people who are more visual than those who are less visual and that's okay it's the practice of learning to think carefully about the meaning of these pictures that matters not that you can do it quickly or that it's intuitive as you continue along in mathematics you will want to focus on the practice of thinking carefully much more than you'll want to focus on thinking quickly this is counterintuitive for a lot of students as they tend to think that better and faster mean the same thing that's just not how it is you want to move towards the idea that clearer and more precise thinking is better because that's the skill that will sustain you when things get more difficult the book starts this section with a technical note about linear approximations in the last chapter we talked about approximating single variable functions with lines but we didn't look at any of the details of it it turns out that this only makes sense if the function itself looks like a line near our approximation a classic example of a function that isn't locally linear is the absolute value function at x equals zero no matter how much you zoom in you will never eliminate the corner and so it will never look like a line there is a similar condition for functions of two variables we say that a function is locally linear near a point if the graph looks like a plane near that point and there are examples similar to the absolute value function that fail to be locally linear functions of two variables the book goes on to discuss some theorems about when functions are locally linear there's a theorem that says that for single variable functions if the derivative of a function exists at a point then the function is locally linear at that point but the theorem does not extend to multivariable calculus knowing that the partial derivatives exist at a point turns out to be insufficient to know that the function is locally linear and you don't even need to come up with a crazy example the function x to the onethird y to the onethird has both partial derivatives existing at zero but the function is not locally linear there the purpose of all of this is to remind you that there's another level of ideas and complexity to calculus that goes beyond just the computations we're only scratching the surface of some of these highlevel concepts the work that we're going to do uses the following theorem theorem if f x y has continuous first order partial derivatives then the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of f at the point x naught y naught f of x naught y naught is this equation when the function is locally linear this tangent plane can be used to approximate the function near the point x naught y naught we can also turn this around if we are given the tangent plane of f at x not y naught then we can use this to read off the values of the partial derivatives of f at x not y naught it doesn't even need to be in exactly the tangent plane form as the partial derivatives are the coefficients of x and y the other terms are just constants that have been rearranged and simplified students sometimes get confused by this because they try to match up the equations too literally the manipulations to undo the step of combining the constants is not hard but it's also not that important so we're not going to elaborate on it linearization is an important calculus concept it's part of a larger topic of finding different ways to approximate complicated functions by using simpler functions you might remember learning about taylor series expansions in single variable calculus which allows us to approximate functions using only polynomials linearization is a simple example of this if we graph a smooth curve and its linearization and then zoom in close to the point of tangency we can see that there's only a small difference between the curve and the tangent line we want to mimic this idea but using a surface and the tangent plane remember that the goal is to get a good approximation of the function it's important to compare the formula for the tangent line and the tangent plane because there are a number of important parallels notice that they both evaluate the function at the tangent point this term plays the role of anchoring the approximation of the function then we have a derivative term multiplied by a difference term we also see that the derivative term is evaluated at the point of tangency and that the variable of the derivative corresponds to the variable in the difference the derivative term gives us the slope of the function in a specific direction and the whole term can be thought of as a change of the function due to moving in that particular direction although we won't do it here we can expand this idea and use the second order derivatives to get a better approximation for the function just as we can use higher order derivatives to get more terms in the single variable taylor series this gets more complicated because we have many types of the higher order derivatives but it's not so complicated that you won't be able to understand the basics of it on your own with just a little bit of thinking in the next video we're going to take a look at differentials we used differential notation briefly when we were working with arc length this is when we used dx dy and dz to represent a little bit of movement in the x y and z directions and then use dl to represent a little bit of arc length this differential notation has some other applications that we're going to look at here given a function f of x y we can use the tangent plane near the point x naught y naught to get an approximation of its value at nearby points while we can use a generic x y to denote a nearby point we want to pick a notation that emphasizes the nearness so we're going to call the nearby point x naught plus dx y naught plus d y where we implicitly view dx and dy to be small values that represent the shift in the x and y directions when we look at the linearization we see that it can be broken up into two pieces the base value is f of x not y naught and the rest of it is the change which we call df when we move the point by small amount the function f changes by a small amount from its baseline value we can also see that if we substitute for x and y using the dx and dy relationships that the difference terms simplify putting it all together we get df equals this quantity in leibniz notation this is written as df equals partial f partial x dx plus partial f partial y d y remember that since we're using a linearization we're making an approximation of the change of f and not the true change of f for the true change of f we would use delta f this is a subtlety that we don't need to dwell on here but just remember that differential notation is implying that we're using an approximation of some type in the calculation let's look at an example suppose you have a machine that cuts rectangles it's supposed to cut rectangles of width 20 centimeters and height 10 centimeters however because of machining tolerances the width can be off by as much as 0.2 centimeters and the height can be off by as much as 0.4 centimeters we are going to use differentials to approximate the potential error in the area in the sketch we've shown dx and dy to be positive values but they could just as well be negative values the shaded area is just a representation of the possible error which we're going to approximate using differentials the formula for area is a equals xy where x is the width and y is the height we will first calculate the derivatives then by using the differential we can compute the error estimate d a equals y d x plus x d y we can then substitute in our values to get that d a equals 10 which shows that the area can be off by as much as 10 square centimeters as a student this sort of problem always confused me why not just use the area formula and get the exact maximum error why even bother with differentials in practice you don't always have a formula this means that the calculation of the derivatives is often the result of a numerical estimate and not an analytic derivation and so in more practical settings you simply don't have access to those things specific to this problem we can absolutely get a more precise answer but that's just not the exercise we're being asked to do problems like this where you have an exact formula from the beginning are really just an artificial construct to provide an opportunity to practice multiple skills the first skill is just practicing how to read and interpret word problems then there's the ability to calculate the partial derivatives correctly and the last skill is to understand the use of differentials and linearization to estimate the change of a function so don't be like me and don't overthink it the main ideas here are that you can use the linearization to estimate the change of a function if you change the inputs by a small amount and that this can be represented using differential notation in single variable calculus the chain rule is the formula that we use to calculate the derivative of a function when you have one function inside of another one an example of such a function is sine of x squared most students remember this as there being an inside function and an outside function and the calculation of this should be basically automatic but as a reminder this is technically a composition of functions if f of x equals sine of x and g of x equals x squared then f of g of x is sine of x squared and applying the chain rule formula directly is how we get the result the idea of the chain rule is that you're trying to figure out how the function f changes as the variable x changes but there's a function that's changing in between them the variable x changes the function g and the changes of g impact how f changes in the previous section we saw how the changes of a two variable function depend on what's happening in the x direction and in the y direction and the changes in each direction may be different so we need to incorporate all of that information into our formula let's be a bit more specific imagine a person hiking along a trail and let's think about how we might model their elevation above sea level over time if we imagine looking down from the sky the trail creates a path that can be modeled in the x y plane the hiker's position would then be a function of time and we can denote the time axis as a horizontal line at any moment of time the hiker is somewhere along the trail this creates a function from the variable t into the x y plane furthermore at any given location the trail is at a certain elevation this creates a function from the x y plane to the variable z which we'll put off to the side as the hiker moves along the trail their elevation goes up and down along that axis this is a composition of functions at any given time the hiker is in some location at any location there is an elevation so at any given time the hiker is at some elevation if we pick multiple time values we get multiple elevations and this gives us the outline of the graph of elevation at any given time now let's think about how the elevation changes with time clearly if the hiker is moving faster the elevation is changing faster but the change of elevation also depends on the shape of the path running up a steep slope will lead to a faster change of elevation than walking along a gentle grade so the change of elevation with respect to time needs to incorporate both elements here's the formula for the chain rule let's try to understand the individual pieces on the left we have the derivative dz dt this is the rate of change of the hiker's elevation with respect to time on the right we have two terms the first term is the change of elevation due to motion in the x direction and the second term is a change of elevation due to motion in the y direction the partial derivative terms give us the slopes of the terrain in each direction and the time derivative terms are speeds it's the combination of slope and how fast you're moving that gives the change in elevation and that's the basic intuition of the chain rule we're breaking up the change of the function z into changes that can be attributed to movement in the x direction and the y direction the chain rule can feel confusing because there are often four or more variables in the problem at the same time and so it is helpful to have a scheme to organize that information in a helpful way the section on tree diagrams is supposed to help with that the core idea is that we're keeping track of the relationships between variables a tree is a type of mathematical graph that can be used to represent those relationships at the top of the tree we have the outermost function and as we work our way down the tree we are keeping track of the internal dependencies here's a tree diagram for the function we were just working with notice that z is at the top and that z is a function of x and y this is the statement that our altitude depends on our location but we can see that x and y are functions of t this is the statement that a position depends on what time it is so as you read down the tree the branches show us the variable dependencies each of the connecting vars represents a derivative it's the derivative of the top variable with respect to the bottom variable you have to decide whether it's a regular derivative or a partial derivative and that simply depends on whether the top function has one or more branches sticking out of it so the top left branch is partial z partial x the top right branch is partial z partial y the two bottom branches are the regular derivatives the x dt and y dt since the variables x and y only have one variable of dependency to construct the derivative dz dt we simply find all the places where t is at the bottom of the tree multiply all the derivatives along connections going back up to the top and then add the results together we can see that there's a left path and a right path on the left path we have partial z partial x multiplied by dx dt on the right path we have partial z partial y multiplied by d y dt this is a situation where a simpler example feels more complicated because it's hard to see what's actually happening so we're going to look at a more complex situation here's another tree diagram in this case the function w depends on three variables x y and z and each of these depends on the variables s and t this means that we can view w as a function of the two variables s and t how can we calculate the partial derivative of w with respect to s we'll start by identifying all of the places where s is at the bottom of the diagram this gives us a number of branches to trace up to the top for each of these branches we write down the corresponding derivatives we then multiply the derivatives that are along the same paths and then add the results the same idea would hold if we had another layer of dependency and this gives us a strong hint as to the value of organizing the information in this way imagine if you had to simply memorize a bunch of different formulas to account for all the different relationships between the variables it would be very difficult one of the key ideas as you get further along in math is to understand patterns and relationships more deeply this helps us to make connections between ideas and allows us to gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for the concepts that we're working with as we continue moving forward in this class i hope that you will make some time to think beyond what's immediately in front of you and try to relate what you're studying to things you've seen previously in your mathematical experiences this will really help you grow as a student of mathematics and it's a practice that will help you in the long run so far we've looked at the partial derivatives to tell us the slope of a function in the x and y directions but there are lots of other directions besides horizontal and vertical so we're going to develop the concept of a directional derivative which is the slope of a function in any direction when we took the partial derivatives we were using a step size of h in either the positive x or y direction and then let h go to zero we're going to do the same thing except free ourselves up to move in any direction if u is a unit vector that we write as u1 u2 then we can multiply it by h to get a vector of length h and this vector shows us the change in x and y if we take a step of size h in the direction of u then the direction of derivative is just the limit of the difference quotient as h goes to zero definition let f x y be a function the derivative of f at the point x y in the direction of the unit vector u is denoted as d sub u of f x y and is given by this formula for those values of x and y for which the limit exists d sub u of f x y is called a directional derivative this gives us the slope of a function when moving in the direction of u there's not too much to say about this formula as it's just the difference quotient using a step size h in the direction of u one important element to remember is that u needs to be a unit vector for this formula to be correct this formula is a little more difficult to work with because we are changing both variables at the same time so we're going to take a more careful look at it suppose we have a function f and let's fix a specific point x naught ynaught and a specific vector u1u2 to get the directional derivative we're going to focus on the line that passes through the point xnaught ynaught whose direction vector is u1u2 here's the parametric form of that line notice that we now have a situation where we can apply the chain rule the function f depends on both x and y and both x and y depend on t furthermore the derivatives of x and y with respect to t just give us the constants u1 and u2 and this means we have a formula for df dt it turns out that u being a unit vector means that we are moving along the line at unit speed and this corresponds exactly to the directional derivative the justification for this can be done algebraically but it's more intuitive to observe that this concept of unit speed is what we use for partial derivatives in the x and y directions and so this is the natural way to generalize it again it's important that we are using a unit vector in this formula if you are working on a problem where you aren't given the unit vector as the direction vector you're going to have to divide it by its length to turn it into a unit vector before doing the calculation otherwise you'll get it wrong if you look at the formula for the directional derivative you might pick up on the fact that it looks like a dot product specifically it's the dot product of the vector of partial derivatives with the vector u this vector of partial derivatives turns out to be an important and useful value in calculus so we give it a special name this is known as the gradient of f and it is written with this upside down triangle the symbol is called a noble but is often just called del so the gradient of f or del f evaluated at the point x naught y naught is the vector of partial derivatives evaluated at the point x naught y naught notice that we've put a vector symbol over the del as always this implies the result is going to be a vector but there's more to it the dell notation is sometimes treated like an operator so del is the vector of partial derivative operators this is a handy notation because it means you can now imply formulas using vector operations for example if you have the vector function f equals f1 f2 we can write del dot f and come up with a meaningful interpretation of what this calculation is supposed to be this is actually known as the divergence and it's a concept that's important when working with vector fields which is a topic that's sometimes covering a multivariable calculus especially if you're on a physics or engineering track the dell operator generalizes to three or more dimensions in the way you might expect it to if our independent variables are x y and z then del is the operator where the partial derivatives are with respect to x y and z we're not going to go into all the details and nuances of this notation but if you go on in mathematics operators become part of the language you use to describe math and you will become more acquainted with the ideas at that point in the previous video we introduced the gradient of a function and its notation but we didn't talk about what it actually represents since the gradient of a function is a vector we know that it is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction we're going to start by looking at its direction we arrived at our formula for the directional derivative by thinking about the algebraic formulation of the dot product but since we're trying to understand the geometry of the gradient it makes sense for us to think about this dot product using a geometric formula remember that u is a unit vector so its length is 1. the angle theta is the angle between the gradient and the unit vector by substituting this information into the geometric formula for the dot product we get this result we are going to think through the case where the gradient is perpendicular to you there are a lot of little steps in the logic so you may need to watch this a couple times and pause it to make sure you really understand the steps if theta is pi over two then the dot product is zero that dot product represents the directional derivative so the directional derivative is zero the directional derivative tells us the slope of f in the direction of u and since the slope is zero the function is not changing in that direction if we move along a path where f is constant we are moving along a level curve of f and so u must be tangent to the level curve of f at that point but since u is perpendicular to the gradient of f we know that the gradient of f is perpendicular to the level curve at that point in fact we can push this even further now let's suppose that u and the gradient point in the same direction then theta is equal to zero and the cosine function is at its maximal value and this means that the dot product is at its maximum value so the directional derivative is at its maximal value another way of saying this is that when u is parallel to the gradient the directional derivative is as large as possible this means that the gradient is pointing in the direction that gives us the steepest positive slope if u and the gradient are pointing in opposite directions then the dot product is at its smallest value and this means that the direction opposite the gradient is the direction of steepest descent again the logic here requires a lot of little pieces coming together and so it's going to feel like it went quickly this is a situation where you need to set aside some time and think through each step to make sure you understand it this is the sort of mental exercise that really helps you to become a more careful thinker if you do it and that skill pays off in ways that go well beyond this class the book talks about applications of the gradient using the context of simulating heatseeking missiles by measuring the local heat gradient you're encouraged to read about that in the book i'm going to use a couple different ideas let's think about the consequences of the gradient pointing in the direction of steepest descent what this means is that if we imagine the function as a surface and place the ball somewhere along it the ball will naturally roll downhill in the direction opposite the gradient and this idea can be used as a basis for modeling how water would run down the side of a hill and that's one application of the concept of the gradient another application comes from the world of data science a common task in mathematical modeling is finding the equation of a line that is the best fit for a bunch of points usually these points aren't in a perfect line which means that any line that we draw is going to have some error associated with it intuitively some lines will have larger errors than others the goal is to find the line that minimizes the error in other words the error is a multivariable function and we're trying to minimize it this is often an extremely complicated function so that we don't have good analytical formula to use our normal optimization techniques from calculus and so we need a different tool that tool is known as gradient descent and it works in a similar way as the ball rolling downhill example we can try to find our way to the minimum value by estimating the negative gradient of the function relative to our current input values and use that to give us a new set of parameters and by repeating this we can hope to converge to the values that give us the smallest error so far we've talked about the direction of the gradient but what about its length there's not nearly as much to say about this but we also can't ignore it let's return to the directional derivative equation we were analyzing earlier when u is parallel to the gradient theta is equal to zero and this expression simplifies to just the length of the gradient we have already seen that the gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent but with this additional observation it means that the length of the gradient is the slope in that direction in other words the length of the gradient gives the maximum rate of change of the function from that location and this is another way to interpret the meaning of the geometric properties of the gradient the gradient of a function and the del operator are important tools for multivariable calculus we're going to see a number of different applications of it over the next couple sections in single variable calculus we had the first and second derivative tests to help us find the maximum and minimum of a function on an interval you may also remember that we had to check the endpoints of the interval if the interval was finite all of these have analogous multivariable concepts we'll start with some formal definitions note that i wanted to make the third and fourth definitions to use parallel language so i adjusted the word slightly from the book's presentation i'm not going to read these definitions in full because the concept should be familiar these ideas are all essentially the same as from single variable calculus a local minimum is a point on the graph that is lower than all the nearby points a local maximum is a point on the graph that is higher than all the nearby points the absolute minimum or maximum are points on the graph that are less than or greater than all the points on the entire graph the picture multivariable calculus is a little more complex because the nearby points are now in infinitely many directions instead of just to the left and to the right but the basic ideas are unchanged critical points for single variable calculus occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to 0 or is undefined when working with multivariable functions we have multiple first derivatives to worry about the key fact is that to be a critical point they must all be zero at the same point definition a critical point of a function f is a point in the domain of f for which the partial x and partial y derivatives are both equal to zero at that point or where at least one of the two partial derivatives fails to exist notice that both equations need to be zero at the same time this can sometimes lead to situations where you need to solve a simultaneous system of equations for the problems we'll encounter these may not be linear equations but they will be equations that can usually be solved by some type of substitution or elimination or possibly factoring students often forget about the possibility of a derivative not existing as a critical point fortunately this usually arises out of something like division by zero where it is clear that extra attention is required so keep an eye out for that identifying critical points is the first step to identifying the extreme values of a function but we also need to use a second derivative test functions of two variables are more complicated than functions of one variable as there are four second derivatives though two of those are usually the same for us by claro's theorem for single variable calculus we have the concept of concavity if the graph is concave up the critical point is a minimum if the graph is concave down then the critical point is a maximum we then have the case where the second derivative is zero which could be a minimum a maximum or neither for multivariable functions there are more shapes we still have something that looks like concave up and concave down but we have to add the possibility of a saddle point which is neither a minimum nor maximum but it's not quite like having the second derivative equal to zero in that case the second derivative test tells us nothing but a saddle point is definitely neither a minimum nor maximum this is called a saddle point because it's basically the shape of a saddle like what you would use with a horse when you sit in a saddle it's concave up from front to back to keep you in the middle but is concave down from left to right so that your legs can go down around the sides of the horse this mixture of being concave up in one direction and concave down in another is what makes it neither a minimum nor maximum here's the statement of the second derivative test theorem suppose x naught y naught is a critical point of the function f for which the derivatives are equal to zero let d be the quantity defined by this equation then there are four cases to consider if d is positive and the second partial derivative with respect to x is negative then f has a local maximum at x naught y naught if d is positive and the second partial derivative with respect to x is positive then f has a local minimum at x not y naught if d is less than zero then f has a saddle point at x naught y naught and if d equals zero the test yields no information the quantity d is known as the discriminant of the function f this quantity can be written as the determinant of a matrix and this form gives a hint about how we may generalize this to higher dimensional functions to review in order to find the local extrema of a function you first identify the critical points by finding where the first derivatives are zero then you use the second derivative test to attempt to classify them as minimum maxima or saddles and there's also the possibility that the second derivative test will give no result in the next video we're going to look at the case of restricted domain the first and second derivative tests help us define the extreme values based on the shape of the graph but there are times that we are working on a restricted domain where that restriction creates a minimum or a maximum here's an example of this from single variable calculus notice that at the right endpoint we see the absolute maximum value for the function on the restricted domain but that maximum is basically a construct of restricting the domain if we extended the domain the function looks like it would continue upward there is a similar effect that happens in multivariable calculus however we need to be a bit more thoughtful for a single variable function the domain is a line segment and the boundary is just the endpoints for a function of two variables the domain is a region in the plane and the boundary is a curve and we have to check the entire curve for extreme values but before we do that we will state the extreme value theorem which also has a single variable calculus equivalent theorem let f be a continuous function on the closed and bounded region r then f has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in r this is an example of an existence theorem extreme points are guaranteed to exist for functions that meet these requirements but the theorem does not tell us how to find the absolute maximum or minimum nor does it say that the points that attain these values are unique all it says is that such points are guaranteed to exist the words closed and bounded refer to certain properties of the domain closed means that the limit points of sequences in the domain are also in the domain and bounded just means the domain doesn't extend infinitely we're not going to dwell on the technical details of these terms but you should do your best to remember them for when you take a course in topology the book provides a fourstep process for identifying the minimum and maximum of a function on a closed and bounded region step 1 find all critical points in the interior step 2 find all the critical points on the boundary step 3 evaluate the function at all the points from the first two steps step 4 the minimum and maximum are the smallest and largest values from step 3. we're going to do example 10.7.8 from the book to demonstrate all of these steps the full details of the calculations are in the book so we're just going to focus on the big ideas we want to find the extreme values of the function t of x y is equal to 2 x squared plus y squared minus y bounded by the equation x squared plus y squared is less than or equal to 1. notice that the domain is a circle of radius one and its interior the first step is to find the critical points of the interior setting the first derivatives equal to zero we end up with the point zero one half since this point is in the interior of the region we need to include it while we could use the second derivative test it's not necessary since we're just going to evaluate and compare the values in step 3. that's a nice feature of finding extreme values on a closed and bounded region for step 2 we need to parametrize the circle of radius 1. we know that we can use r of t is equal to cosine t sine t for t between 0 and 2 pi so we plug this into the function capital t to turn this into a function of a single variable and for this we can just use our single variable calculus skills taking the derivative and setting equal to zero gives us the equation cosine of t times negative two sine t minus one is equal to zero solving this gives us t equals pi over two three pi over two seven pi over six and 11 pi over 6. you may have to review some trigonometry for this as it goes back to the concept of using reference angles and knowing in which quadrants the sine and cosine functions are either positive or negative strictly speaking we should consider the endpoints where t is equal to 0 and t is equal to 2 pi for this situation extending the domain just means tracing the circle periodically so this won't create any more potential extreme values but if this were a rectangular region those endpoints would be important now we're at step three we're going to calculate capital t at all the points we got from the previous steps there was one point from step one and four points from step two remember that little t gives us the coordinate by plugging it into the parametric equations but we can also plug it into the single variable formula that we created the last step is to identify the smallest and largest values and declare those to be the minimum and the maximum the smallest value is negative 1 4 which happens at zero onehalf the largest value is nine fourths and it appears twice at plus or minus square root of three over two negative one half this is one of the first truly multistep problems of the course as the problems get longer it's important to remain organized in your presentation this will help you to think more clearly and will help others to understand you better there is no single right way to do this but i recommend blocking off your work into steps for step 4 i recommend writing your conclusion as a sentence rather than just putting a box around a number and writing a single word next to it this may seem like a small thing but communication is central to mathematics and the sooner you learn to work and think and complete sentences the better the method of lagrange multipliers is at least in my view one of the great magic acts of multivariable calculus it's a simple idea that proves itself to be extremely powerful the underlying logic can feel a little confusing at first and the actual computational process can sometimes be complicated but it's such a clever and insightful way to solve the problem what is the problem in the previous section we were trying to find the extreme values in a twodimensional region the second step was to find the critical points along the boundary of the region for a simple region like a rectangle or a circle it's not hard to set up the parametrization but if the constraint were any more complicated it would basically be impossible to parametrize it the method of lagrange multipliers does this step without parameterization at all we're going to be working with two functions the first function is f which is the function that we're trying to find the minimum and maximum values for the second function is g which is the constraint equation we're going to assume that we can write the constraint as g of x y equals c where c is any constant some books write that as g of x y is equal to 0 which makes no difference at all to the method let's imagine a graph of the level curves of f remember that these are the curves that represent a constant value of the function to make this picture concrete we're going to imagine this representing a mountain with the peak in the middle of the circles now let's think about the constraint equation the constraint equation creates a path along the function every time our path cuts across a level curve of f we must be going either up or down for example at this point we're climbing up the mountain and at this point we're descending down somewhere in between going up and going down there must be a point where we level out and that point happens where our path is tangent to the level curve it is at that point where we are no longer cutting across level curves but instead of traveling along one of them and that's our first observation the critical points along the constraint happen where the constraint is tangent to the level curves recall that the gradient of f is a vector that points perpendicular to the level curves of f let's focus on the gradient at the point of tangency that vector is going to be perpendicular to the level curve which means that it's also perpendicular to the constraint curve we want to find another representation of the direction that's perpendicular to the constraint curve at that point and the trick is that the equation g of x y is equal to c is the equation of level curve of the function g and so the gradient of g gives us a direction perpendicular to the constraint curve at the point of tangency as well and that gives us our second observation the gradients of the two functions must be parallel to each other we know that two vectors are parallel to each other if they are scalar multiples of each other and so the gradient of f must be a scalar multiple of the gradient of g and that gives us the core relationship for lagrange multipliers the upshot of all of this is that this very simple formula is the way that we can solve for the extreme values of the function along the constraint to find the extreme values solve the system of equations given by setting the gradient of f equal to a multiple of the gradient of g this symbol is called lambda and it's the greek letter l solving this will locate points along the constraint where the directional derivative is equal to zero which is basically the same idea as the first derivative test of single variable calculus now i realize that not everyone will appreciate just how cleanly these ideas come together into this formula but i would encourage you to think through it a couple times for yourself and really try to make the connections it brings together a number of ideas from across the last couple chapters into a nice package but at the end of the day for a course at this level you just need to show that you have the ability to solve the equation the process itself is simple you calculate the gradients set the components equal to each other and solve for the variables a good trick for this is to not divide by any variables because that could lead to division by zero instead you want to multiply and factor using substitution or elimination i don't quite like how the book does this example so we're going to briefly overview the steps that i would use to solve the problem you can pause the video to read the steps line by line but this is something you should take as an outline and work through the algebra yourself the function f that we're trying to optimize is x squared y and the constraint is the equation 4x plus y equals 108. notice that the function g is the left side of the constraint equation when we plug this into the lagrange multiplier equation and set the components equal to each other we get 2xy equals 4 lambda and x squared equals lambda don't forget that we also have the constraint equation 4x plus y equals 108. there are three equations and three variables and so we can begin to solve this if we directly substitute for lambda in the first equation using the second equation we get 2xy is equal to 4x squared moving everything to one side and using the fact that x is positive we see that y is equal to 2x we can then plug this into the constraint equation which gives us x equals 18 and y equals 36 this is the only critical point under the conditions that x and y are positive if we took away that restriction then x equals zero becomes another critical point but for this problem having found the critical point we simply plug it into f to get the extreme value and that's the basic flow for how we solve these problems in some cases you may have multiple critical points in which case you just plug them all in and identify the largest and smallest values notice that the final conclusion was written as a complete sentence i really want to encourage you to get into that habit the formula for lagrange multipliers works for any number of dimensions activity 10.8.3 gives you an opportunity to do such a problem you are strongly encouraged to work through that one because experience is really the best way to learn this technique in single variable calculus we were able to think of integration as area under a curve our goal with this chapter is to increase the number of dimensions and think of integration as volume under a surface but before we can do that we need to do a review of the ideas we used in single variable calculus suppose we have a function y equals f of x and that we are interested in the area under the curve between x equals a and x equals b the way we did this was by approximating the area with rectangles we're going to start from scratch and build out all the pieces of this construction let's suppose that we're going to use n rectangles and we're going to make them all the same width for simplicity to do this we divided the interval from a to b into n pieces so that each piece has width delta x which is equal to b minus a over n this collection of points along the xaxis is called a partition of the interval from a to b we can then use these points to construct vertical lines that form the heights of the approximating rectangles but what is the height that we're going to use we have many choices we can pick the height to be the value of the function at the right endpoints we can pick the height of the function to be the value at the left endpoints we can pick the height to be the value at the midpoint or we can even pick arbitrary points for each interval each choice gives us a different collection of rectangles to approximate the area we will generically call these points x sub i star where i counts the rectangles from left to right regardless of how we choose these points we can write down the approximate area under the curve by adding up all the rectangles each rectangle has width delta x and height f of x sub i star and then we add these together to get a result known as riemann sum to get from the riemann sum to the integral we take the limit as n goes to infinity we're going to repeat this process except with an extra dimension we're going to imagine the function z equals f of x y that sits above the x y plane and we're interested in the volume of the surface that sits above a rectangle the rectangle is the generalization of the interval let's focus on the rectangle first in the x direction the rectangle goes from a to b and in the y direction it goes from c to d in order for us to make a partition we need to decide on the number of pieces we want to make in both directions we'll use m in the x direction and n for the y direction this makes a total of m times n sub rectangles this also means that the length in the x direction is delta x equals b minus a over m and the length in the y direction is delta y equals d minus c over n we can also see that the area of each rectangle is delta a which is equal to delta x times delta y above each of these subrectangles there's a surface if we extend this up into three dimensions we get a box the height of the box depends on the point in the region you want to use some common choices are the corners and the midpoint whatever point is chosen we will denote it as x sub i j star y sub i j star the i j pair gives us the location of the specific rectangle once we've picked these points we can then calculate the volume of the boxes and add them up this gives us a double sum called a double riemann sum this is what we use to approximate the volume under the surface from here if you're given a specific function and a specific rectangle you can actually plug in values to get a numeric result activity 11.1.2 walks you through that so i'll leave that one there the book formalizes this process into a definition it's a bit long and wordy so i'm not going to read it off word for word but here's the summary let f be a continuous function on a rectangle r to get the double riemann sum of f over r you partition the rectangle into m pieces in the x direction and n pieces in the y direction to get m times n sub rectangles inside of each rectangle you pick a point that will be used to calculate the height of the box corresponding to that rectangle then you calculate the volumes and add them together and that result is the double riemann sum just as with single variable calculus as the number of pieces in the partitions increases your approximation gets better and better the double integral is the limit of the riemann sums as m and n go to infinity and that's formalized in the next definition definition let r be a rectangular region in the x y plane and f a continuous function over r with terms defined as in the double riemann sum the double integral of f over r is the limit of the riemann sums as both m and n go to infinity there's a bit of a notational hiccup here i will always explicitly write the double integral sign for a double integral however some people will use a single integral sign and implicitly use the da term and the region of integration to indicate that it's a double integral i think that's a confusing way to do things but some of the online homework problems in the book might do that hopefully you'll be able to understand based on the context looking back at single variable calculus one of the first issues we ran into with area under a curve is the fact that sometimes the function is negative you might recall that we treat those areas as being negative values so that we're actually talking about a signed area the same thing extends to volumes if the function goes negative then we treat the volumes as being negative which gives us a signed volume so the double integral can tell us the signed volume of region the idea of area under a curve also leads us to the average value of a function the concept is easiest to visualize in single variable calculus after we've calculated the area under the curve we can imagine redistributing the area across the whole interval and converting that area into a rectangle the height of this rectangle is what we call the average value of the function and we can write down the formula for it using an integral the same thing works for double integrals except that it's now a volume that we're averaging out into a box instead of an area that we're averaging out into a rectangle but it's really the exact same idea notice that the length of the interval has been replaced by the area of the region of integration this is the natural generalization of the size of the underlying domain when we move from one dimension to two dimensions there are a couple properties of double integrals that mirror the properties of single integrals the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals we can also factor out constants from an integral and integration respects inequalities and by that we mean that if f is larger than g then the integral of f will be larger than the integral of g this section is mostly a review of the concepts that go into integration on the one hand it's new because it's a multivariable function on the other hand these ideas are the same ideas as in single variable calculus in the next section we're going to see how we can apply our previous integration knowledge to the double integrals we just created to iterate something means to repeat a process an iterated integral is an integral of integrals the idea is initially intimidating but once you understand the picture you'll see it's not so bad imagine that we have some function f sitting above a rectangle we saw in the previous section that the double integral of f over the rectangle is the volume beneath the function our goal is to figure out how to use our integration knowledge to calculate the volume following the traditions of calculus we want to imagine how we might cut this task up into little pieces and then add them all together we're going to start by making thin slices parallel to the yzplane notice that this is like a trace because this is a region where x is basically constant except it has just a little bit of thickness we'll call that thickness dx then the volume of that slice is going to be the area under the curve multiplied by dx and to find the area under the curve we can use our single variable integration techniques notice that the lower end point is c and the upper end point is d so that we can express the area as an integral this is a d y integral which implies that x is some fixed value this formula gives us the area of the cross section and then we get the volume of the thin slice by multiplying it by dx to get the total volume we need to add up all these individual volumes from here we just make a substitution we usually drop the parentheses and use position to tell us which limits correspond to the integration you can always put the parentheses back in if you get confused or you can also explicitly include the variable of integration in the limit the language can be a bit confusing a double integral is the conceptual object we created when we took a double riemann sum and took the limit as the partition got smaller and smaller an iterated integral is the specific process of calculating a double integral by first integrating with respect to one variable then the other it is an integral of integrals this distinction is subtle and is not something that will likely cause problems but it's worth keeping in mind we can do this process again but make the slices parallel to the xzplane it turns out that the result is very similar intuitively we would think that the answer we get should be the same since it's the same total volume and while it's not true in general it's true for continuous functions and this result is known as fubini's theorem theorem if f is a continuous function on a rectangle r then the double integral can be calculated as an iterated integral in either order and the result of both calculations will be the same when calculating these integrals the biggest point of struggle for students is keeping track of the variables when you're integrating with respect to x all the y variables are treated as constants and when you're integrating with respect to y all the x variables are treated as constants and when you plug in the limits make sure you plug into the correct variable it takes time and practice to really get comfortable with this but it's not because it's hard you just need the practice of mental organization and keeping the information straight in the previous sections we only used a rectangular domain but what if we wanted to have a domain of a different shape a quick answer to this is that we can always embed a finite region inside of a rectangle and then we just define a new function that matches the given function on the initial region and 0 everywhere else and while this works as a theoretical answer it doesn't help us in any practical sense so to get to a more practical solution we're going to consider two types of regions some books call these type 1 and type 2 regions but it's not that important of a distinction the idea is that we're looking for regions that can be completely covered by thin connected rectangles in either the vertical or the horizontal direction this corresponds to the thin slices we made in the previous section our basic goal is that we want to make sure those slices make sense this first example is a typical example that can be covered using vertical rectangles the key features here are that there is a lower function and an upper function and that the region is bounded by constants on the left and the right with these bounds set you can draw in connected vertical rectangles and cover the whole region this also gives us the information we need to set the limits of the integral the main principle is that your integral should always be understood as lower to upper the inner integral is a dy integral and the bounds for that are of the form y equals something in terms of x for the dx integral the lower constant is a and the upper constant is b we've been repeating the phrase connected rectangles this next example shows how you can get a failure of this on the right side of this region there is no way to cover both tips with a single rectangle without also covering areas that are outside of the region the only way to cover just the parts that we want with vertical rectangles would be to have two disconnected pieces at the same x position or use more advanced techniques such as dividing the region into multiple pieces however if we use horizontal rectangles we can sidestep all of this horizontal rectangles correspond to integrating x first the lower curve is on the left and the upper curve is on the right notice that these are functions of y and not functions of x and the lower and upper constants are now in the ydirection we can see that the rectangles cover the region and this gives us the set up for the integral notice that the order of integrals has been swapped to dx dy this is very important there are some regions that can be covered by either type of rectangle but there may be practical reasons to prefer one over the other consider this triangular region it's not hard to see that this can be covered with both horizontal and vertical rectangles however it turns out that if we use vertical rectangles it will be slightly more complicated to understand why we have to think about the functions involved in defining the boundary the lower curve is straightforward but the upper curve is actually two separate functions this means that when we set up the integral we're going to have to break it into pieces sometimes this is a necessary step but in this case it can be avoided by using horizontal rectangles instead this arrangement gives us one lower function and one upper function and this means we can set up the integral as one piece i strongly recommend that students graph the region to help them visualize it there's too much going on to try to keep it all in your head we're going to work through example 11.3.3 we're going to set up the integral using both a dxdy and a dydx integral to give you more exposure to that process the full calculations are in the book so we won't spend time on that we really just want to focus on setting up the integrals here is the region of integration for the first time through we're going to integrate with reset to y first this tells us that we will be looking at vertical boxes and that the limits of the inner integral will be of the form y equals something if we look at the graph we can see that the lower function in the y direction is the line y equals zero and the upper function is the diagonal line by doing a quick slope intercept calculation we can get that the equation for the line is y equals 3 halves x and that sets up our inner integral for the outer integral we simply look at the left most and right most parts of the region the leftmost is at x equals zero and the rightmost is at x equals two now let's look at the other direction with the x integral first we are looking at lower and upper functions to be at the form x equals something the upper limit is x equals 2 and the lower limit is the diagonal line again but we need to write it in the form x equals something in this case it's easy to get the equation x equals 2 3 y for the lower limit then the y limits are y equals 0 and y equals 3. and now we can set up the integral sometimes the region of integration will be implied in the limits of the integral in these situations it's helpful to sketch the graph of the functions in the limits to help you visualize the region correctly this is especially important if you end up swapping the order of integration you usually will not be able to do that without having a graph of the region there may also be times when the integral itself is harder to integrate in one order compared to the other and you won't necessarily be able to determine this in advance so you may simply have to set things up and see what happens one last observation for this section for integrals over rectangular regions we had a formula that gave us the average of the function on the region the same equation holds for general regions the function a of r is the area of the region which used to be a rectangle but now can be anything in some cases you may have to integrate to find the area between the curves however if the region is a known shape such as a triangle a rectangle or a circle you may be able to use geometry to calculate the area instead of setting it up as an integral as much as possible you will want to find ways to simplify your work instead of blindly following a fixed process this section expands our capacity to work with double integrals which will help us in the coming sections make sure that you do the exercises to get enough practice with these integrals as they are only going to get more and more complicated from here in this chapter we're going to look at a number of applications of double integrals i'm going to take these in a different order than the book in the previous section we worked on setting up double integrals over general regions by thinking about covering those regions with either vertical or horizontal rectangles it turns out that we can take those ideas and use them to calculate the area of those regions the key idea we want to work with is the same integration concept we've been using throughout the chapter to calculate the total area we want to cut it up into a bunch of little pieces and then add them all up here's the notation that should feel familiar the da term is sometimes referred to as the area element and while this is formally a double integral we should really think of it as an instruction that says cut up your region into a bunch of small pieces and add up the areas the area element has multiple forms depending on the specific problem in application its value will depend on the shapes of the pieces you create when you cut up the region so far we've been working with rectangular regions based on how we set up the double riemann sums a couple sections ago we've been using dx times zy and dy times dx as the area element because that's from the formula for the area of a rectangle this also means that when we're thinking about our regions we've been cutting them up into little rectangular pieces as the rectangles get smaller and smaller we get better and better approximations and as long as everything is mathematically nice the limit converges to the correct value it's worth noting that there are other ways to cut up a region and if we use a different shape for the area element then we end up with a different formula in some cases those alternative area elements are a better match for the region of integration and this can lead to some computational simplifications we will talk about this in more detail in a later section you may remember that in single variable calculus we were not only able to find the area below a curve but we were also able to find the area between two curves we want to elaborate on the connection between that formula and iterated integrals for single variable calculus we were calculating the area of a bunch of rectangles and summing the results the difference term in the integrand is measuring the height of the rectangles and the dx term corresponds to the width when we are setting up the limits of integration for iterated integrals we were looking at the exact same picture tracing out that vertical strip corresponded to the dui integration in fact we can rederive the formula by just working out the first step of the dy dx integral for the area it's important to make these connections because this is what forms the foundation of other applications of integration we're now going to switch gears and look at a particular application of double integrals a lamina is a fancy term for a flat thin object it should remind you of the word laminate as in putting a thin sheet of plastic over a sheet of paper you can think of a thin disc of plastic as an example of a lamina our goal is to calculate the mass of a lamina but we're going to consider cases where the lamina may not have a constant density and so we have to figure out how to put mathematical language to this situation density is a ratio of mass to some unit physical dimension in our case we're going to be looking at mass per unit area because we're working with a flat twodimensional object but this could just as well be a linear density or a volumetric density let's take a small piece of lamina at the point x y and calculate both the area and the mass of that piece we can take that information to get the density of the lamina at that point and if we do that for the entire lamina we would get a function that tells us the density of the lamina at every point we can also clear the fraction to get this useful relationship the mass of a small piece of lamina is equal to the density multiplied by the area this formula holds for any type of density if you replace the area element with the appropriate measurement for the given situation now that we've worked with the concept of density let's try to get the total mass of the lamina the total mass m is the sum of all those small masses dm each small mass can be calculated as the density multiplied by the area which we will write as da so this is the formula for the total mass from here it's just setting up the integral as before in many problems the density formula will simply be given to you and you'll need to make a substitution and do the calculation but in some problems you will need to come up with the formula yourself most of those problems will give you the density using phrases such as proportional to or inversely proportional to as a quick reminder if a is proportional to b then we have a is equal to kb for some constant k and if a is inversely proportional to b then a equals k over b for some constant k these two basic relationships can be extended to more complex situations it's just a framework for how we express relationships between quantities if the density is proportional to the distance from the origin then we would have that delta of x y equals k times the square root of x squared plus y squared if you pay attention to the language you should be able to make the connection between the words and the equations in the next couple sections we're going to look at the concept of the center of mass of a lamina and take a look at some probability theory the applications from the previous video were primarily about setting up integrals we're now going to see how we can use that ability to address more complex problems the center of mass of an object can be thought of as the balance point of the object for a circle it should be intuitive that the balance point is right in the middle but for a half circle you can probably intuitively recognize that it's somewhere along the line that cuts it into two quarters but where exactly along that line is not at all clear this problem gets even more complicated when we think about objects where the density is different in different locations in order to develop the formula for the center of mass we will start with balancing two objects along the massless onedimensional bar the two objects have different masses and are located at different positions in order to talk about these positions we're going to introduce a coordinate system how do we find the balance point let's call the balance point x bar and we can intuitively see that it's somewhere between the masses what causes the bar to tip it turns out that this is related to the torque the masses create around the balance point as gravity pulls on them if the sum of the torques is 0 then the bar will be balanced otherwise it will tip over and while we could go through this whole discussion using vectors it's easier to note that when the force is vertical and the bar is horizontal we can use that torque is equal to force times distance the force is due to gravity and the distance can be calculated since we know the positions we'll say that the objects to the left of the pivot produce a negative torque and the objects to the right of the pivot produce a positive torque this corresponds to the right hand rule after some quick algebra we get this equation which gives us a strong hint for how we might generalize the situation let's do some quick algebra on the general form first we distribute and then separate the sum into two pieces notice that x bar is constant so it can be factored out of the sum then we move the second sum to the right and divide by the first sum to solve for x bar and this is the formula to get the center of mass for one dimension how can we handle this in two dimensions it turns out that we can view each dimension independently of each other to find the center of mass in the x direction we view everything from the point of view of the xaxis and reduce it back to a single variable problem another way of saying this is that we're creating a vertical line as a balanced axis we can do the same with the y direction then bringing those together gives us the full form of the equation for the center of mass this is a good start but we need to move from discrete masses to a continuous mass in order to determine the center of mass of a lamina fortunately we've developed all the appropriate skills in the previous section so we just need to apply them to our situation conceptually we're just going to take our lamina and cut it up into a bunch of pieces and then use our work with discrete masses in the limit as the pieces get smaller and smaller we change the sum to an integral the only trick is we need to think carefully about which part is cut up into pieces in this case the mass is the part that is being cut up and so the mass becomes dm this gives us the conversion for the various sums but then we need to use the fact that the mass is related to the area element through density which we can then substitute in from here it's basically just the matching game to get the center of mass when it comes to working out these problems it's mostly about keeping the computational mess organized when i work on these problems i calculate the mass of the lamina separately rather than putting it into one gigantic fraction i find it makes my life a whole lot easier to not have fractions made out of double integrals there are simply too many ways for me to make mistakes as you do these problems you can sometimes use symmetries to help simplify your work while you should be able to grind out long computations the use of symmetries is a way of learning to think ahead and work more efficiently sometimes you can use both a geometric symmetry and an algebraic symmetry together if both the region and the density are symmetric about an axis then the center of mass for the opposite axis is zero the explanation for why it's the opposite axis is a bit wordy but the pictures make this intuitively obvious so it's better just to focus on the picture another type of symmetry shows up in the integrals if your interval of integration is symmetric about zero and the function you're integrating is odd then the integral will simplify to zero you can also separate out the odd parts of the integral from the rest of the integrand which may help you to simplify your work the common odd functions are odd powers of x and the sine function just be certain to double check the limits and check that the function is odd before applying this trick otherwise you're going to make mistakes but if you can correctly identify when this happens you can save yourself a lot of work so it's worth keeping an eye out for these things the last application comes from probability theory students are usually introduced to probabilities using a discrete framework we can imagine a box that contains one red ball and three blue balls and compute the probabilities of the different outcomes by counting the number of balls of each color and dividing by the total number of balls but there's also a geometric framework for probabilities imagine we have a spinner that's broken up into colored regions as shown here what is the probability that we would spin and end up on blue our intuition tells us it's the same as with the balls but we need to do some work to set it up more carefully when we spin the spinner the end result is an angle that we can take to be between 0 and 2 pi and that makes the interval from 0 to 2 pi our sample space for our possible outcomes each point in the sample space corresponds to either red or blue so we can label that axis by the color if our spinner is perfectly fair then every single value from 0 to 2 pi would be just as likely as every other and so we should be able to represent the probabilities with a constant line we can then color from the theta axis up to the line to create a geometric representation of the probability notice that the ratio of the areas gives us the same results as before but let's change the picture a bit let's pretend that the spinner is stickier in the red area than the rest of it so there's a higher chance of it stopping there we can represent this by increasing the height of the red area and decreasing the height of the blue area now the geometry shows that the chances of getting red are larger than before because the ratio of red area to blue area is greater the second example gives us the insight we need for this section the function that gives the height of the rectangles is known as the probability density function let's take a look at the definition for a function f to be a probability density function on a set s it needs to satisfy the following conditions f of x is greater than or equal to zero for all x and s this just means that there are no negative probabilities the integral of f of x dx over s is one this just means that there's a 100 chance that something in s is going to be chosen the probability of x being between a and b is the integral of f x dx from a to b this is how we convert the probability density into a probability this is analogous to integrating over a mass density to get mass the probability density function is the function that gave the heights of the red and blue graphs that we had earlier for any interval that we choose the probability of the spinner stopping in the interval is the integral of the probability density function over that interval right now we're looking at just one variable but we can expand this to two variables and get a joint probability function with a joint probability we are looking for two events to happen at the same time so instead of a spinner we might think of a dart board where the location of the dart is described by both the angle and the distance from the center if we're working with two independent variables then the sense at needing a double integral to calculate probabilities instead of a single integral here's the definition for a joint probability distribution function f x y is greater than or equal to 0 for all x y and d the double integral of f x y over d is one the probability of a point x y being chosen so that the point is in the region s is given by the double integral of f over s you might notice that the language used here is slightly different from the language of the book the book specifically sets up the probability density calculation as a rectangular region instead of a general region but that difference doesn't change the core meaning of anything once this is set up everything is a matter of doing the calculation and learning to interpret the meaning activity 11.4.5 is a good activity for introducing many of the essential concepts a company is making smoke detectors and they require components from two different suppliers each component will have a life span which is some sort of probabilistic value because that's just how things work in manufacturing the joint probability function gives the probability density for any specific combination of lifespans the book goes on from here to walk you through how you can use this function and pick different regions of integration to get meaningful results i'll leave that for you to work out for yourself you may find it helpful to sketch a graph of the domains of integration when you're working through this just to make sure you understand what's happening remember that every point corresponds to a pair of life expectancies and that the joint probability function is giving you the probability density for that specific pair of life expectancies we're going to start this section with a review of polar coordinates you probably saw polar coordinates in your trigonometry class but it's good to take a moment to review the basics polar coordinates is a coordinate system set up around circles that are centered at the origin locations in this coordinate system are denoted by a pair of values r theta the r value corresponds to the distance from the origin and theta is the angle to that point as measured from the positive xaxis so the point 3 pi over 4 is on the circle of radius 3 at an angle pi over 4. we can relate points in polar coordinates to points in rectangular coordinates using right triangle trigonometry if we start with a point x y in rectangular coordinates we can use that point to draw a right triangle we can then label the length of the legs of the triangle this allows us to calculate r by using the pythagorean theorem the angle at the origin is theta and we can set up an equation to get its value using the tangent function conversion in the other direction is also an exercise in right triangle trigonometry the same diagram gives us the formula x equals r cosine theta and y equals r sine theta it's important to note that theta is not uniquely defined as you can increase the angle by 2 pi and end up in the same location this allows us to continuously wrap around the origin instead of having a discontinuous jump in the angle from 2 pi all the way back down to zero the big idea is that we want to be able to integrate using polar coordinates this is useful because some integrals are more circular than rectangular and so it is helpful to be able to use a more natural coordinate system in fact some integrals are impossible to do unless they're done in the appropriate coordinate system the basic integral can still be set up as a double integral using the area element d a but we can no longer use d x d y to represent that because that corresponds to rectangular coordinates instead we need to use a polar rectangle which are the shapes that we create when we draw the lines of constant r and theta however it's not quite as easy as just using d r d theta the problem is that you can have the same values for d r and d theta and end up with two different areas this is because the area also depends on how far from the origin you are so we will need to figure out how to compensate for that the trick is to think about the geometry of the situation the space between the two radii creates an annulus which is a washershaped region the space between the angles is what gives us the polar rectangle activity 11.5.3 walks through the process of calculating that area and then taking the limit as the r and theta values get very close to each other the end result is that you get da is equal to rdr d theta and that area element gives us what we need to convert everything into polar coordinates here is the formula for the double integral in polar coordinates this feels complicated but all it's saying is that you substitute r cosine theta for x r sine theta for y and rdr d theta for da and then you need to set up your limits and integrate setting up the integrals can be tricky because you're probably not as familiar with polar graphs for the d theta integral most problems are simply going to have constants and so that tends to be easy for the dr integral you're trying to trace from the lower curve to the upper curve where the curves are functions of the form r equals something in terms of theta in the r direction you can think of lower to upper as inner to outer tracing outward from the origin you may need to sketch the polar graph to figure out which is which but once you've done that it's no different than in rectangular coordinates when doing these problems it's helpful to remember the pythagorean identity this will be useful when making substitutions the most prominent example comes from the expression x squared plus y squared in fact in general situations when you see the combination x squared plus y squared that is sometimes a hint that you may want to think about using polar coordinates instead of rectangular coordinates this gives you the basic groundwork for working with integrals in polar coordinates as with so many other things in calculus you're going to need to invest some time working through problems to get comfortable with it the book has both activities and exercises to guide your practice when we introduced parametric curves one of the benefits we discussed was that we could trace any curve we wanted we were no longer restricted to working with paths that were functions of the form y equals f of x the step up to parametric surfaces is the same thing the simplest example to think about is a sphere if we tried to use z equals f x y to capture the shape of a sphere we would only be able to capture either the top half or the bottom half but not both at the same time we are still going to use vectors to locate points just as we did with curves but now we're going to have two input variables which corresponds to the two dimensions that exist on the surface we want to talk through the process of creating a parameterized surface an instructive example is the taurus a torus is basically a donut shaped region how can we describe this shape using parametric equations we first have to carefully define the shape we will begin with a circle of radius a on the x z plane centered at the point b 0 then we will rotate this shape around the z axis we will first begin by getting parametric equations for the circle we will use the variable t for this this should be familiar with your previous work with parameterizing circles we do need to make a couple changes since we are in the xz plane instead of the xy plane and we've shifted the center away from the origin but neither of these should be too complicated we now need to think about how the shape is rotated around the zaxis rotation around the zaxis does not change the zcoordinate so we will focus on just the x and ycoordinates each point along the circle gives us a radius with respect to the zaxis we'll call that radius r for now if we want to take this point and rotate it around the zaxis we would be tracing out a circle of radius r parallel to the xy plane at a fixed height of z we know that the parametric formula for such a circle is r cosine s r sine s z where we're using the parameter s because t has already been used earlier the values r and z come from the first part and so we just need to make the substitution from the original circle to get the final result what does this vector formula mean for every pair of values st we get a point somewhere along the torus and based on the construction the s value gives us an angle when looking down the z axis and then the t value gives us the angle relative to the center of the tube activity 11.6.2 works through creating a parametrization of a sphere this one is particularly important to work through because it lays the foundation for spherical coordinates which we will discuss a couple sections from now just as we could parameterize curves based on functions we can also parameterize surfaces based on functions for curves of the form y equals f x our parametrization was t f of t for surfaces of the form z equals f x y we use s t f s t the same warning applies to this as with parametrizing curves in that you should not use the coordinate variables x and y as your parameters doing this creates confusion and can lead to problems down the line if you're not careful now that we have parameterized surfaces we can try to do some calculus with them our goal will be to come up with a formula for the surface area of a parameterized surface this derivation has a lot of steps and draws on a lot of ideas so you may need to go through it a couple times when we were looking at polar coordinates we saw that we made a small polar rectangle when we made small changes to r and theta when working with a general parametrization we are going to get some other type of rectangle just as with polar rectangles these aren't actually rectangles they are some sort of warped shape but we're going to refer to them as rectangles because there isn't a better word to use you can see these rectangles on the images of the taurus and the sphere from the book notice that towards the top of the sphere the rectangles are getting quite warped all of these rectangles come from drawing out curves of constant s and t again we can think about polar coordinates as a model the polar grid is nothing more than drawing curves of constant r and theta we want to do the same thing with our general parametrization so now we come down to the real meat of the problem how do we calculate the area of one of these rectangles let's pick some ordered pair s naught t naught and imagine drawing a rectangle where we change the parameters by ds and dt this rectangle is formed by the curves where s and t are constant and we know that the sides can be labeled by these equations this region can be roughly approximated by a parallelogram the key insight is that the sides of the rectangles are curves of constant s and t so that the tangent vectors can be used to give us their directions but the tangent vector is only a direction and not the length of the vectors to get the appropriate length we can think of this using differentials the partial derivative of r with respect to t gives us the vector tangent to the curve of constant s it is the amount of change in position per unit change of t along the curve so if we want to approximate the change in position moving along that rectangle we would use partial r partial t multiplied by dt that dt term accounts for the step size that we're taking in the t parameter the same idea works in the s direction and now we use the fact that the length of the cross product of two vectors gives us the area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors to get our area element we get d s is equal to the length of r sub s d s cross r sub t dt because of the properties of the cross product we can factor out the ds and the dt giving us this alternative representation the book uses d a for dsdt since the sdt acts just like dxdy would but that notation can potentially get confusing if you're not careful so i'm going to leave it like this then to get the total surface area we integrate over all the small surface areas and that gives us our final formula just as with the other section once you have the formula it's a matter of doing some practice calculations to get comfortable with it all of the conceptual work is in the derivation and the calculations are just time to practice pay attention to the limits and sketch out the region of integration if you need to at the start of this chapter we went from a single integral to a double integral a triple integral is next in the progression fortunately the ideas themselves are not any more complicated the only real challenge is the change of the visualization when we had a single integral we saw it as area under a curve for double integrals we saw it as volume under a surface but for triple integrals we don't really have any more space in our threedimensional visualization to describe it geometrically this forces us into a more abstract setting where we're no longer thinking about a physical dimension but simply as adding up the values of a function multiplied by the volume element we'll start with the definition of a triple riemann sum this is a long definition but everything functions pretty much the same way as it did with the double riemann sum the primary difference is that there's a third dimension floating around so we have sub boxes instead of sub rectangles in the same way as before we would pick a point within each box and add up the function values multiplied by the volume of the individual boxes and once we have this set up all of the ideas from before can be pushed forward into three dimensions when we take the limit as the size of the boxes go to zero we convert this into a triple integral the symbol dv is meant to represent a little bit of volume although this notation has a lot of symbols you should be comfortable enough with the ideas that's not too bad we have three integrals because we have three dimensions to integrate from here we can look at our two dimensional ideas and see how they look in three dimensions in two dimensions we work with areas and in three dimensions we work with volumes the average value of a function on a region is the same idea just replacing the denominator with the appropriate quantity notice that this fits with the pattern of previous formulas we had to calculate the mass of an object we just integrate the density multiplied by the appropriate differential element the formulas for the center of mass generalize similarly and you can look it up in the book if you want at this point we have observed that these formulas mirror our previous formulas we have not actually talked about how to set up these integrals fortunately it's conceptually the same as before following the lower to upper mentality that we've developed the only catch is that the lower and upper surfaces are more difficult to keep track of and you really need to pay attention to what's happening let's look at example 11.7.5 here we are asked to find the mass of the tetrahedral region of a particular density you can get from the equation of the plane to the graph by sketching the x equals zero and y equals zero traces as well as the z equals zero level curve we're not going to worry about the integration part itself because it's just a bunch of calculations that are worked out in the book we're going to focus on the ideas for setting up the integral the most intuitive way is to do the dz integral first what this means is that you want to think about the lower surface and the upper surface the lower surface is the z equals zero plane and the upper surface is the slanted plane the book gives us the equation for this which we need to put in the form z equals something the challenging part is to think about what this means for the remaining two integrals the idea is to think about lines in the z direction that fill the region what are the x y coordinates that you will need to account for all of those lines in this case it's the triangular shape at the bottom of the region but that doesn't always mean it will be that for each problem you will need to think about where those vertical lines will be drawn to fill the volume and use that as your guide another way to think about this is to view the picture looking down from the positive zaxis and look at the shape that you see from that perspective i've found students to be a mixed bag with this depending on just how comfortable they are with visualizing shapes in three dimensions so you're just going to have to give it a try and see what works best for you we still need to set up the integrals for the region in the x y plane which requires us to find the equation for this diagonal line that line comes from the intersection of the slanted plane and the z equals zero plane which gives us the substitution we need in other problems that boundary may be the intersection of other types of surfaces so you'll just need to think carefully to make sure you can understand what's going on but once we've reduced it to a two variable problem then the setup should feel more familiar if we do this as a dy integral next we will have y equals 0 as the lower curve and y equals negative x over 2 plus 3 as the upper curve and the x limits are 0 to 6. putting this all together we get this as our integral and we would still need to work it out fortunately the integration steps are straightforward you do need to work very carefully and cleanly as small mistakes like missing a negative sign can be extremely difficult to locate and correct very few students find this to be easy the first few times the book has multiple activities to help you with this process and you're strongly encouraged to work through all of them it's important that you take your time and think through everything carefully so that you make sure you really do understand what you're doing just as the twodimensional plane can be described using either rectangular coordinates or polar coordinates we have multiple ways of describing threedimensional space in this video we're going to focus on cylindrical coordinates and in the next video we'll discuss spherical coordinates cylindrical coordinates are what you get if you take polar coordinates and just drag it up into three dimensions the core shapes that we get are cylinders which is where the name comes from the z dimension is the same as the z dimension and rectangular coordinates and so the equations going back and forth between the two coordinate systems is basically unchanged from before to go from rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates we use the relationships r equals the square root of x squared plus y squared and tangent theta equals y over x and then leave the z value unchanged to go from cylindrical to rectangular we use x equals r cosine theta y equals r sine theta and the z is unchanged setting up a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates requires us to get the volume element dv in terms of the variables r theta and z fortunately we can use a general property of volumes to calculate dv when you have a shape where the volume is created with constant cross sections then the volume is the area of the cross section multiplied by the thickness we know the cross sectional area from polar coordinate integrals so we multiply that by dz to get that the volume element is rdr d theta dz this allows us to immediately write down the triple integral in cylindrical coordinates the limits of the integral follow the same pattern as before by always working from lower to upper the z direction is often integrated first which then leads to creating an area in the x y plane which can be broken down using polar coordinates in these problems you usually go back and forth between cylindrical and rectangular coordinates using the relationship r squared equals x squared plus y squared it's worth taking a moment to look at a couple basic shapes described in cylindrical coordinates all of these shapes are rotationally symmetric around the zaxis you basically take the shape of a graph and rotate it around the zaxis to get these volumes this makes sense because cylindrical coordinates are built around that type of rotation the equation z equals r gives us an inverted cone that goes out at a 45 degree angle from the origin if we let r be both positive and negative we get a double cone in general lines will lead to cones if the slope of the line changes then that will be reflected in the shape of the cone and shifting the yintercept will change the location of the tip of the cone the best strategy is to graph the line in the plane and think about what you get when you rotate it around the zaxis another common shape in cylindrical coordinates are paraboloids these are equations that look something like z equals a r squared for some constant a the constant a just adjusts how wide or narrow the paraboloid would be and if the constant is negative then the paraboloid will open downward if you add or subtract a constant you will shift the location of the vertex these two basic examples form the foundation of your intuition for graphs and cylindrical coordinates remember that these graphs are taking advantage of the fact that these are symmetric about the zaxis shapes that don't satisfy that property can be much more difficult to graph in this coordinate system in the next video we're going to look at spherical coordinates spherical coordinates are much more difficult to work with than cylindrical coordinates in this case all three variables from rectangular coordinates are interacting with each other here is the graph of the point x y z in rectangular coordinates we want to get from this to spherical coordinates rho is the distance from the point to the origin we can get this value using the distance formula theta is the same angle that we used in polar coordinates to get this we need to look at the image of the point when staring down the zaxis another way of saying this is that theta is the angle that we get in polar coordinates if we project the point onto the x y plane phi is the angle that is made with the positive z axis when the point is connected to the origin this is called the azimuthal angle and is somewhat analogous to lines of latitude on a globe except that the reference is the north pole and not the equator from this diagram we have the ability to calculate how to get back to rectangular coordinates from spherical coordinates a trick that helps most students to see this is to use alternate interior angles and draw the angle phi at the point x y z this helps to relate the sides of the triangles more naturally to the sides of the box we can see that z is the side adjacent to the angle phi and that the hypotenuse of the triangle in the x y plane is the side opposite the angle phi everything else is just right triangle trigonometry you should really try to reconstruct this picture on your own from scratch that is a good measure for how comfortable you are with the coordinate system and the practice of it really helps to get these relationships to sink in a good way to build intuition with spherical coordinates is to think about the shapes you get when you hold one or another variable to be constant if rho is constant you just get a sphere this is because rho is the distance from the origin and saying that this value is a constant is exactly the definition of a sphere if you hold theta constant you get a vertical half plane coming out from the z axis it's important that you only get a half plane and not a full plate this is related to phi only being measured from the positive z axis and not all the way around lastly if you take phi to be a constant you get a cone as fee gets larger the cone opens more widely when phi equals pi over 2 you actually just get the x y plane and then larger values of phi give you a cone in the negative z direction you should try to visualize what curves you get when you hold two of the variables to be constant if you can do that then you should have a good understanding of how the spherical coordinate system works activity 11.8.6 walks you through the derivation of the volume element in spherical coordinates we're going to leave it as an activity instead of working through it because it's a good culminating challenge as we approach the end of the book the basic idea is that we're approximating the volume with a box and you need to think about the lengths of the three dimensions everything else is just figuring out how to approximate those values the end result is that dv is equal to rho squared sine phi d rho d theta d phi even if you don't fully understand the derivation of the volume element once you have it you should know what you need to do with it we can just make the substitutions from rectangular to spherical coordinates and plug in the volume element to get the triple integral for spherical coordinates the formula looks long but that's because it explicitly contains all the substitutions the good news is that setting up the integral is exactly the same as before you are looking at trying to set up a sequence of lower to upper regions that map out the final shape the diagrams we created earlier can be extended to help think about lower to upper shapes for rho you get a spherical shell for theta you get a wedgeshaped region sort of like a slice of a tall circular cake and for feet you get a conical shell somewhat like an ice cream cone this is probably the most difficult visualization sections for the book you don't have a lot of experience to help you see these shapes and so it's going to be tough when trying to think through the regions it's okay to sketch multiple pictures to try to get it right you shouldn't imagine that you'll draw it right the first time all the time but as you keep working through the problems you should start to get a little bit more comfortable with this just take your time with these problems and you should be able to make it through it turns out that integration in polar cylindrical and spherical coordinates is a subset of a larger class of integration techniques known as change of variables or change of coordinates a change of variables is conceptually no different from a u substitution from single variable calculus where we replace one symbol with another because it's more convenient for some reason the challenge is that this is actually a very complex process we're going to start with the two variable change of coordinates and we're going to use polar coordinates as our model the framework for change of variables is that we have two coordinate systems one of those coordinate systems is the standard x y plane on this plane we have a region r that has some sort of complexity to it the idea is that in a different coordinate system we can find a region s that is simpler and easier to work with that happens to map onto r under some transformation t optimistically we can even hope that we end up with a simple rectangle after the change of coordinates in this case we might recognize this region as a polar rectangle and that gives us the idea that polar coordinates might be a good choice there's nothing telling us this other than our experience and it can be very difficult to identify a good change of variable substitution in general notice that on the r theta plane the region is represented as a true rectangle we can explicitly write down this formula using our polar coordinate substitutions notice that under t the rectangle and the r theta plane gets mapped to the polar rectangle each side of the r theta rectangle matches up with one of the curves in the x y plane there's a warping of the shape that changes the area and we're going to need to figure out how to compensate for that for polar coordinates we explicitly worked out that the warping factor was r and that's related to the fact that the polar rectangle gets larger when r gets larger even if you keep d r and d theta the same in this case we had to explicitly work out the geometry the goal of the next section is to work that out for a general transformation for polar coordinates we had to use the details of the transformation and geometric considerations in order to get the appropriate scaling factor the general change of coordinates process is a bit more complicated because we have to work in the abstract we're going to start with a transformation that maps from the st plane to the x y plane we will assume that the coordinates in the x y plane are denoted by the functions x of s t and y of st now we're going to imagine tracing a small rectangle in the st plane and take a look at what happens to it in the x y plane we'll set the bottom left corner of the st rectangle to be the point a b and the sides of the box to be delta s and delta t when we map this to the x y plane the three corners get mapped to these three points we can see that the shape of the region is probably not all straight sides but because the values are small it will be close to approximate the area we're going to use the parallelogram formed by two of the sides we can get the expressions for these vectors by subtraction notice that we can factor out a delta s or delta t to make these look like difference quotients then we can take the limit as delta s and delta t go to zero to get these partial derivatives and differential terms at this point i'm diverging from the book's presentation but we'll see that we end up in the same place when we're done the notation is a little bit sloppy but i think it's much easier to understand the partial derivative of a vector function with respect to s or t is just the vector formed by the partial derivatives of the components so these two expressions really do make sense as vectors and we'll see what they look like in a moment the point right now is that we can calculate the area element d a from these by taking the length of their cross product this gives us a concise expression for the area element that we can substitute in to calculate the integral we are now going to see that this relates back to the book's version by writing everything out explicitly when we said that the area of the parallelogram was the cross product we implicitly went up to three dimensions but where the z coordinate was always zero so as we work this out we're going to explicitly write in that dimension to make the calculations work we will first work out the partial derivatives and then compute the cross product it will turn out that the i and j components will be 0 so that taking the length of the result is straightforward this last form is the same form that's in the book the quantity involving the partial derivatives is known as the jacobian and is denoted with this shorthand notation this is actually just the determinant of this two by two matrix where the pattern is that the rows all have the same dependent variable and the columns have the same independent variable this gives us another way to write down the area element and now that we have the area element we can write down the formula for the change of coordinate calculation to do a calculation of this type you're often going to have to come up with a substitution yourself the problems usually give you a big hint by looking at the form of the integrand or the boundary usually they will imply substitutions by how terms are grouped together for example in activity 11.9.4 you are trying to calculate this integral notice how the integrand strongly suggests a substitution for x plus y and x minus y if the problems did not point you in the right direction you likely would not be able to do the calculation this idea can be generalized to more variables by using a higher dimensional jacobian the general process is still the same but now you have the determinant of a 3x3 matrix as your scaling factor this is what the jacobian looks like we're not going to show the derivation of this because it's just too much at this stage but if you followed along with the derivation from the previous section you can probably come to a good understanding of how this works for this class you are merely expected to be able to follow the process for example you can verify our formulas for dv in both cylindrical and spherical coordinates by using the substitutions we developed in the previous section and just working out the details doing problems is a bit of a process as there are a bunch of steps including making sure that you've got the right transformed region but i think the book does a pretty good job of holding your hand through it because while the calculations themselves are not any more difficult than the problems in previous sections the entire setup can be a bit rough there's a reason that this is the last section of the book but if you've been doing the exercises over the last three chapters there's nothing here that you shouldn't be able to do and that's it for this course i hope you've enjoyed the videos and you've learned a few things about multivariable calculus thanks
