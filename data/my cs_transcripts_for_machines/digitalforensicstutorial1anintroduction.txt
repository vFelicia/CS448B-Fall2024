computers and other digital devices are becoming ubiquitous in our modern society it was inevitable that they would begin to feature as heavily in crime and law since the late 1970s the amount of crime involving computers has been growing very quickly creating a need for constantly developing forensic tools and practices from its inception in the 1980s the digital forensics field has grown in popularity and support digital evidence is being recognized much more easily in courts and companies are understanding the need for proper forensic processes when investigating employee malpractice initially the field grew out of the work and needs of practitioners rather than from academics and scientists this lead to early digital investigations tools and practices being ad hoc and uncertain since the early 21st century proper practices and guidelines have helped to formalize the field digital forensics is at root a forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices forensic analysis of computers is a discipline growing in popularity amongst both the forensic science and computer security fields several university courses now teach the basics and professional qualifications are on offer from the forensic software developers although the cost of entry into the field can sometimes be prohibitive the market for forensic analysts is still strong and as time goes by the free software available to hobbyists is becoming more advanced becoming an analyst probably still does not require a formal degree in the field most of the skills can be learned through training and simple experience being an analyst requires two main skill sets attention to detail often investigations culminate in legal proceedings either of the civil or criminal nature to satisfy the reasonably strict rules of courts around the world digital evidence needs to be audited and carefully tracked as detailed later in the book digital media is easily altered and courts are still resisting evidence without a full audit log inquisitiveness unlike other areas of forensic science digital investigations tend to be much more free form they often require investigators to have a deep grounding in both the technical aspects of computers in the psychology of the computer criminal this course aims to detail the practical theoretical and legal aspect of a digital forensic investigations the main focus of the material will be on computer devices touching on differences with mobile device forensics a relatively new subfield in addition the course will discuss legal aspects of working in digital forensics and give advice for managers in charge of an investigation in their workplace finally we will look at the concept of antiforensics and counter measures
