this is the video on how to get data into SAS so that you can analyze it you must have the data into SAS before you can analyze it there's lots of different types of data we're gonna look at three types of data that we can get into SAS one is when you have a small data set you can hard code the data into the SAS code too you can import the data from your computer from a CSV file or some other data file and three we're gonna import from the Internet so let's go ahead and start SAS 9.4 English make this nice and big blank editor down there so let's begin option one is going to be hard code the data into SAS and this is an option that you would use if perhaps you had a small data set or you wanted to share this script across between you and your collaborators so here's the here's how it starts all always when you load data into SAS you start with the data statement it's gonna be data doesn't have to be capital dat a but I like to capitalize my staffs commands and then the name of the data set and we're gonna call this tree data for obvious reasons the next line is your input line it starts with a keyword input and then it's followed by every variable that you're going to input block is one variable TRT MNT for treatment is a second and growth is the third this dollar sign follows treatment because treatment is going to be a character variable it's not gonna be in America it's gonna be in this case an a B or C although any string that you would use and at the very end we've got two at signs what that means is it tells SAS to keep reading in in block treatment growth block treatment growth block treatment growth block treatment growth block treatment growth until the end of the line without that it's just going to read the first block treatment growth then go to the next line of block treatment growth the double apps at the end it says just keep reading until the end of the line now we don't just have to import the data we can actually create data as we work with in what and this is called a data step that's where we take care of all of our data so I'm going to define the variable year it's gonna be 1997 so for every single record the year is gonna be 1997 it's a pretty good year there have been better there have been worse I can also create a variable and I'm gonna call it LG growth and it's gonna be the log of the growth value and growth is in the data set so in the data step you can create a new variable all by itself or you can create a new variable that's based on a variable in the data set okay once you've got that taken care of you go to the data lines command and that says okay this is going to be the start of the data that we're reading in these are going to be lines of the data alternatively instead of data lines you could use the command cards CA RDS as a throwback to when the data actually was stored on little punch cards but we're gonna use data lines here and I just typed in the data block treatment growth block treatment growth block treatment growth so this is one record block one treatment see the growth level is six point seven nine this is another record block for treatment C with the growth of 6.43 notice there are no semicolons here but there is one at the end of all the data semicolons are very important for SAS every line has to have a semicolon on it unless it's a very special line and then we're gonna end this with run so I'm gonna highlight all of this and I'm gonna run it or I guess submit again SAS was originally a server language so and you'd be working on your little dummy terminal at your computer so always talks about in terms of cards and submitting to your server and it gives you server times etc now I can either click on this little running person up here or just submit or I can hit f3 on my cat my keyboard I'm going to use f3 boom here's the log of everything that just went down line 1 2 3 4 5 6 all the data is in lines is associated with a data line statement of 6 and then 10 is the end of it then we ran it I don't see any red here red would indicate that there's some error so everything looks like it worked well or did it it's kind of hard to tell because I really would like to see the data as SAS sees it and so to do that in order to print out the data I'm gonna run our first proc it's called proc print proc canceled okay I'm back I'm not sure what's going on with the keyboard okay proc is short for process but it's just proc and print and again you don't have to make these uppercase I tend to do all my proxy an uppercase now proc print says you want to print something out what do you want to print out want to print out your data and what data do we have it's tree data so data equals tree data and again end it with a semicolon run and then f3 and then here's resultsviewer and this is our data block treatments growth year which is something we created that wasn't originally a part of this data set and log of growth which again we calculated based on the growth so this one point eight eight eight five eight it's just the natural log of six point six one notice that up here in the results side we've got our results data set you can click on that and we get back to our data so that's Method one it's to hard code the data into SAS and there's some advantages to that and the main advantage is if you look I can email this to you and you've got this exact same data as I have now option two is you're going to import the data from a local file so let's go ahead and do that option I'm going to minimize this window I'm going to go into my H Drive my H Drive actually has that 50 13 there's the data set I want to use Fischer 38 it's a CSV file how do I know it's a CSV file Microsoft Excel comma separated values file and if I just want to look at the data I can double click it and again I'm here on my desktop it's gonna open up into whatever program I have that defaults to opening up CSV files and this case it just happens to be Excel consists of two variables variable one is the sample number and it's one through four and Roman numerals and variable two is colonies notice again variables are the hit our columns records our rows okay so we got sample and colonies is our two variables let's get back into SAS so now I want to import that data set so here's how we can do it yeah again we start the data step with the keyword data specify the name of our data set in this case it's back to data which is short for bacterial data now the first new part here is the in file statement in file means you're bringing in to SAS memory the file that follows and again it's in quotation marks and I said it's a and because I'm working on this on the on the server this has to be an absolute path which means it starts with the H because it's on my H Drive and it ends up with the name of the data set it's Fisher 38 dot CSV I have to specify the delimiter is a comma and that the first observation that I want is in Row 2 because in this data set Row 1 was the data that was the variable names so we're skipping over that and going straight to Row 2 second is the input notice we had an input back here on the when we hardcode the data input was followed by the variable names in order you can do the same thing here sample and colonies sample remember was 1 through 4 in Roman numerals so it's got to be followed by a dollar sign we really don't have to call it sample and colonies but that's what the data set has it we might as well well with a run and just to double check everything's working correctly that we got everything in we followed up with a proc print now again as before we could create a new variable here we could call it year is equal to 1938 which I believe was when this data was done and we could do law colony while call is it log of colonies remembering to end each line with a semicolon go ahead and run all this f3 here's the data sample colonies year ln call so this is 4.0 604 4 is the natural log of 58 now notice something in SAS it prints out in a sansserif font which means it's very difficult to tell what is this a lowercase L and an uppercase I so keep that in mind at times this could be a lowercase L this could be an uppercase I we we do know it's an uppercase I so keep that in mind when you're using variable names so that was option 2 importing it from a local file option 3 is importing the data from the internet itself and this is a popular option you're able to store your data on the Internet and have everybody in the group work with that data this requires a little bit more when one more line requires the file name statement the file name statement we'll save the URL that you specify to the right and store it in the variable data location so at the end of running this line the variable data location will have this string this your L in it notice it's a URL a full URL it starts with HTTP colon backslash backslash and then the rest of the address this line must be run before you can in file this data then we start with the data step call this data stat data I don't know why but we'll call it stat data for fun followed by the in file statement in file data location that and that have to be exactly the same then again the delimiter in the first observation and this in this file the first line belongs to the variable names so first all of this will be equal to two we r gonna skip that first line and just import the data itself then again as with the last remember the last started with data then in file the input its data then in file the input name of the variables gender we see is a character variable it's gonna be M Neffs or males and females college is also character variable it's going to be CAS be us etc those are dollar signs the annotate indicate character variable it's a very strong way of specifying that you're working with categorical variables and again we can actually create a new variable GPA purse and we'll just be the GPA divided by four or you do just about anything we want same as the same as always all the fiddling with the data it takes place within the data step and then we run it all if you notice we had some errors there so let's go ahead and scroll up on the log and see what those errors were see if we can interpret what SAS is telling us this is a good place to actually show you how SAS gives us error codes or in this case doesn't and you have to kind of guess what it means error 'invalid logical name error in the file name statement so I know something's wrong with line 24 file name data location URL HTTP everything looks pretty good error in the file name statement hmm whatever should we do and at this point you realize that SAS really doesn't give you good hints and what's wrong with your code which is unfortunate so what I do is I always hop on to Google and Google something like in this case SAS filename statement and then I'll find out oh this data location really can't be just any old via variable name has to be a very specific variable name that variable name has to be data file so instead of data location it's got to be data file and the only reason I know that is because I went to Google and googled SAS filename statement so do that right now go to go to Google and search for SAS file name statement and read up on it you'll see it there's a lot of help files out there both within SAS and at other places very very useful so we fixed it changed it from data location to data file changed it here and on the in file statement let's go ahead and run it and here's our data set ID grade gender was males and females GPA sat math age college and GPA PCT which is % GPA divided by 4 pretty basic right there so here's what we did in this and let's go ahead and just finish it off with a nice little quit just to give us a feeling of satisfaction so he did three things in this little video thing number one was we showed how to import how to get the data into SAS by hardcoding it and this is where he did that this always started with data and then input and the input told us what the variables were and when we hardcode the data and we did it after the data line statement option two was to import the data from a local file we started with the data then in file and here's where we specified the local file it is the absolute path and I have to use the absolute path because I'm using this shared desktop and then followed by the input again note that the dollar sign means that the proceeding variable is a is a character variable and then the third way is to import from the internet the new line there is the file name statement you must start with file name the word data file the word URL and then the actual URL in quotation marks and then the data step the in file the input etc so three ways of getting data into sass and you really do need to have data into sass before you can actually do anything with the data I hope this was oh and one last thing we did was discover that sass error commands or error codes are not always that helpful let's go ahead and start sass this one actually covers how to do univariate and bivariate sample statistics so we'll open up sass as usual maximize it editor this is where we do all of our typing first step in anytime anytime that you want to analyze data the first step is to get the data in to SAS because if SAS doesn't have the data in its memory it's not gonna be able to do any analysis so we're going to import this data from the internet it's gonna be the stat grades data set remember your key word file name followed by the word data file URL and then in quotation marks the URL for the data there's a CSV data set then we start the data stat data step we're gonna call the data set stat data follow it with in file input and again remember these are the variables in the data file gender is a character variable that's why there's a dollar sign after gender College is also character variable categorical variable we're gonna create a new variable called GPA PC tln which is just the natural log of the GPA percent natural log at the GPA percent GPAs run from 0 to 4 there we go and this will load in the data so after running these and remember we can either do it by the running person up here or f3 on the keyboard let's do it the running person okay I see no errors in the log nothing red up there so we're good to go of course one thing that we really do want to do is actually look at our data just to make sure that we got it in there correctly so to do that we're gonna do a proc print proc again is for processed print is the actual process we want to use here tells the SAS that we want to print something so what are we gonna print we're gonna print the data set stat data here's the data set stat data now it may be more helpful than instead of calling this the SAS system we call it stat data to do that we're gonna change the title title 1 is equal to data stat data so let's run that that's out of the proper order oh there's no equal sign you know we had the error up there it said it's not valid reminded me that there shouldn't OB it should not be an equal sign there now let's rerun the proc print notice up here on the results side the first time we ran proc print we got print which is the proc name the SAS system the second time we ran it after we did the title we got print then whatever the title was now the title again is up at the top instead of the SAS system okay let's start doing some univariate statistics here the variable of the process you're going to use its proc univariate which kind of makes sense because it's a univariate statistics that you're doing and what are you gonna do it on you're gonna do it on the data and then run you run this and here's what you get you're gonna get univariate statistics for the ID variable the grade the GPA the SAT Math the age and the GPA percent Ln that's not all the variables this is just all of the numeric variables these are just the variables that have numbers associated with them what are the universe tx that you're given well for instance for the GPA PC tln variable you're given sample size you're given the mean you're given the standard deviation the skewness the kurtosis the variance the sum of all the observations we're not waiting so this some weights and an are gonna be the same you're given the coefficient of variation you're given the uncorrected sum of squares which is just squaring all of the values and adding them up you're given the corrected sum of squares which is just squaring all squaring the difference between the value and its mean adding it all up actually the corrected sum of squares is going to be equal to n times the variance I'll let you figure out why you got me media mode also listed here IQR range variant standard deviation skip the test for location we'll deal with that in a later chapter we're given the quantiles q1 q3 q2 min Max and we're given the 10 extreme observations the five lowest and the five highest a lot of information given here just from one simple line of code or I guess two simple lines of code and that do that for every single variable but we don't have to if all we care about is the GPA variable then we could specify we just want it from the GPA variable or maybe we want the GPA variable and the SAT math variable notice there's no comma here and notice this line starts with var again that could be lowercase var or uppercase var since it's a SAS command I like to use uppercase let's run that and we just get you know very statistics with GPA and SAT math okay so that's for all of the numerical variables what do we do for the categorical variables it's a new process it's a new proc it's proc FR eq f req is for frequency data equals stat data they have to specify the tables when it was numeric variables or numeric data we specified the bar that was optional when its categorical we specify tables and it's not optional we must specify the tables at tables for gender and college here's the frequency tables for gender and for college forty five in the sample were female fiftyfive for male that's forty five percent fifty five percent since gender is not ordinal the cumulative frequency and the cumulative percent don't make sense college also is not ordered an ulcer the cumulus also don't make sense thirteen business majors fiftyseven colored from the College of Arts and Sciences Lebanon from the College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources nine from education one from lasso and nine from other again the percents for each of those so the difference is for numeric data you can't specify the variable as you want but you don't have to for categorical variables you must specify the variables you want so that's all of the univariate statistics now we can look at correlations bivariate statistics and again a new proc for you to learn this reason be proc cor cor R stands for correlation specify the data let's see what we got tells us there's six variables that it can run correlations on these are the six numeric variables ID grade GPA SAT math age GPA PCT LM gives us some simple statistics for each of those six and then this table is the correlations technically it's just the first or the top number that's the correlation so the correlation between GPA and grade is point three three five five eight top number the correlation between age and SAT Math is point zero eight four two four the correlation between GPA and GPA PC tln is 0.99 144 those are the correlations between those variables and remember that correlations are the order doesn't matter so the correlation between GPA and grade three three five five eight is the same as the correlation between gray than GPA three three five five eight the correlation between grade and grade is gonna be one so it's gonna be ones down the diagonal guaranteed and the upper part of the matrix is going to be the mirror of the bottom part also guaranteed the bottom numbers will ignore that until we get to hypothesis testing which will take place later one last way of comparing two variables notice that these were comparing numeric or quantitative variables we can do it using we can do something similar but not quite similar we can also do what's called cross tabulation with the categorical variables if we look up here it's proc freq when we're dealing with categorical variables tables gender and college just a space between the two meant that we want a table of gender and a table of college if we do gender x college then it's going to give us a cross tabulation of gender by college so up here we got the number of males number of females here we got the number of business majors number of college of Arts and Science people etc doing it this way we're gonna get the number of males who are males her business males are College of Arts and Sciences females her business females who are College of Arts and Sciences etc so we're able to look at some sort of correlation between these two variables now to test that correlation again we're gonna have to wait until later in the course so there are in this sample there are five female business majors eight male business majors three female edy majors six male ed majors five male others eight female castner's college of agricultural science nature resources so the whole numbers are going to be the frequency the numbers right below it are going to be the percent of the entire data set so female casts people are 25% of the entire data set and the frequency is 25 the data set is of size 100 so this is going to be 25 divided by a hundred times hundred percent the third is going to be the row percent which means of all females level females fifty five point five six forecasts belonged to College of Arts and Sciences of all females eight point eight nine belonged to other of all females 11.11 one two business of all males ten point nine 1% were education so the third row third number is going to be the row percent it's gonna be of all whatever the row variable is that's the percent that belonged to the column compare that with the fourth variable or fourth number this is the column percent so this would be of all education so give that the persons in education of all the education 66.67% were male all college of arts and science forty three point eight six were female well business sixty one point five for were male so this is a conditional probability the fourth number is going to be the column percent third will be the row percent so given male 14.5 five percent we're business as opposed to given business sixty one point five four percent were male we will cover conditional probability in Chapter two you're gonna see that it's very important here and that's it you know very statistics let's go ahead and just call this quit just for the satisfaction we're done felt good this quick little video on SAS this one covers graphics so let's start up SAS they were into sass first step when we're doing graphics is to import the data make sense cuz you can't do much with the data unless it's in sacis memory we're gonna import the stat grades data set again run this recall to run it we can either do f3 or click on the running person so here's the data that was imported should look pretty familiar notice up here there's no red so there was no errors okay so the data is in their first step or the next step let's go ahead and do a bar plot for all of these charts categorical variables that function is gonna be G chart Proc G chart specify your data specify what chart you want H bar will be for horizontal bar chart and the variable notice College is a categorical variable then run so here is the result it's a horizontal bar chart Business College of Arts and Sciences etc the length or the width I guess of the bar is going to correspond to the frequency or to the relative frequency there's thirteen business majors in that stat class that's 13% IDI there's nine ed majors which is nine percent now one thing we can do to tidy this up a little bit is to get rid of these statistics on the right to do that instead of H bar College will just do slash no stats no difference this is without the no stats this is with the no stats that's the difference there's no stats makes the bar chart a little bit wider we could also group this according to gender since that's our only other categorical variable so group equals gender and that oh it's kind of hard to tell the difference we're but these first ones are female so this is the frequency of female business students this is the frequency of male business students female college of arts and science students male College of Arts and Science students it would be better if there is a bigger space between these two so let's go ahead and get a space in there to increase the space we're gonna call it G space and make it 10 that will increase the spacing between the groups hence the g and g space so here's without the g space here's with the g space big space between the males and the females allows you to better see where the break is between males and females and instead of a horizontal bar chart we could do vertical bar charts horizontal would be H bar vertical would be V bar and we can also change the space between the individual bars call it space equals one so now we got vertical instead of horizontal we got this space between the groups the G space we got the space between each of the categories in the group pictures space equals one female on the Left male on the right it's go groups bar chart you could also do instead of frequencies we could make it percents type equals percent so here it was frequencies here it's just percents since the data set is of size 100 doesn't look like there's much of a change we could also do pie charts so instead of V bar for vertical bar chart or H bar for horizontal bar chart maybe just PI go ahead and get rid of all that and look at a pie chart gives us the level and the frequency of that level and then graphically puts it into a pie chart we could also split this by male and female if you want same way group equals gender but instead of putting the two pies on one graphic it just splits it over two so this is for the females because it says gender equals female and this is for the males gender equals males and this is for everything together three histogram the bar charts the pie charts etc all come are all used to illustrate categorical variables histogram can be used to illustrate or to look at the distribution of a numeric or quantitative variable histograms are found in the proc univariate again it's proc univariate specify the data specify the variable that you want the histogram of in this case we wanted at the grade and then the keyword histogram you notice every one of those Lyons Anne's with a semicolon here's what the histogram looks like notice that you also get univariate statistics on the variable grade because you're using proc univariate if you want to overlay this with the normal curve it's not too difficult after histogram I got a slash than normal and there it is now when you overlay it with a normal curve usually what you're saying is that you want to test if the variable in this case grade comes from a normal distribution again we'll talk about testing later but this last part does that it checks to see or provide several tests to determine if the grade variable would actually did come from a normal distribution we'll cover that later in hypothesis testing that was three the histogram for is gonna be the Box in whiskers plot this is gonna be a tricky one so you want to pay close attention here it's a box plot so a new process box plot specify the data again plot tells you what you want to plot GPA is going to be the dependent variable it's gonna be the numeric variable gender is the independent variable it's going to be your independent variable and specify a box style equals schematic that allows the the usual style of box plot where you actually show the outliers if you leave the box style equals schematic off the whiskers will run from the minimum to the maximum as opposed to the inner the lower inner fence to the upper inner fence as usual so here's the boxplots oh my goodness something's wrong here got male female male female male female what what what gives one of the quirks of sass is you have to sort your data before you can do a proper box plot on it and that sorting is done using proc sort it's a new process Prock sort give it the data specify what variable you're going to sort by we're going to sort by gender because we're gonna plot our box plot by gender now when we run this we get the box plot that we expected female on the Left male on the right these are outliers for the females these are maximums this is a minimum for the males this is the lower inner fence for the females horizontal line again is going to be the median this is Q 3 Q 1 here the diamond is actually the mean so SAS gives you automatically the mean for your box plot which is kind of help the fifth is going to be the CDF plot ZDF plot uses proc univariate much the same way that the histogram does so instead of histogram you'll type in cdf plot if you want the normal overlay you'll keep the slash normal if you don't you'll leave it off here's your CDF plot with the normal overlay and finally the scatterplots scatterplot belongs to a different proc it's not proc G chart it's proxy plots data equals that data plot dependent variable star independent variable if you want to have different symbols for the different genders you'll do equal gender if you want them all to have the same symbol you'll leave that off here's the default Bock a scatter chart pluses are used blue pluses for female red pluses for male like guess that makes sense in some way I'm having trouble seeing the difference between the blues and the Reds must be my eyes and the symbols are kind of small so it's not too helpful I guess to make it better we could make the pluses bigger or change the symbols all together and here's we're gonna change the symbols we're gonna call symbol 1 we're gonna make it red its value is going to be a star that's an asterisk mmhmm and its height is gonna be 2 so hi equals 2 we'll make it twice as big then height equals 1 then simple 2 is gonna be blue that's value is going to equal a greater than sign hmm it's interesting just so happens that value equals star will give you the symbol for females and the value equals greater than will give you the symbol for males which is very natural for this type of plot made the females a little bit bigger just to show you that size can be created there you can do height equals to to make the males just as big hmm it's much easier to see or at least this one is much easier to see than the default where everything seemed to be the same color to me now we made it much more obvious and we really don't even need the legend at the bottom telling us female and male because we know that this is the symbol for females and this is a symbol for males I do want to emphasize there is a really nice little website that shows you all of the special marks that you could have it's the UCLA website and that's the end of this those were the six basic graphics that you can do so let's go ahead and quit we quit it and that's everything and again those six graphics that we looked at the first one we looked at was the bar plot both the horizontal and the vertical second was the pie chart first in the second the bar plots and the pie charts to use for categorical variables univariate histogram was the third for quantitative variables fourth the box and whiskers plot also quantitative fifth was the CDF plot the cumulative distribution function plot teachers in SAS these would be tests and confidence intervals these are going to include the ttest the median test the wilcoxon test those three are for the population mean or median it's going to also include the proportions test and the binomial test those will be for the population proportion and the variance test which would be for obviously the population variance so let's start SAS and since we have to analyze data the first thing we have to do is import the data so let's go ahead and import the stat grades data file file name is as usual data step again we're gonna call our dataset stat data we're gonna in file the data file that we defined above its comma delimited so delimiter is a comma first obsequious since the data set is in canonical form that first row is going to be the variable names then the input line which has the names of the variables that were inputting and these are names of the variables as we want them to be ID grade gender remember the dollar sign tells us that the preceding variable in this case gender is a categorical variable SAT math age college and again college is going to be categorical in this data step let's also define the variable term now we're gonna find to be fall 2014 because that's when that data when the data were collected and while we're at it we'll go ahead and create a title for this and do a proc print and run all this just to make sure that we've inputted the data correctly I remember when you're running it you can either do f3 on your keyboard or click on this little running person on this little running person we ran it the results are listed over here in the results window they're also provided and provided down here on the results viewer here's the data everything looks like it checked out fine term is our new variable fall of 2014 notice it does not change at all for this data set that's fine since we're doing one population procedures we really should get to know our data one of the best ways to get to know our data especially if we're focusing on the mean or the median of the data is to create a box plot if we recall from activity 1b she create a box plot in sass its proc box plot specify the data then in the second line statement its plot GPA is your dependent variable star or asterisk term remember here term is just fall of 2014 that doesn't change so this should give us a single box plot since we specified box style equals schematic we're going to get the whiskers going to the inner upper fence and the inner lower fence and circles will be the outliers let's run this and there's your box plot we have three low outliers there's the inner lower fence the inner upper fence that Dimond again is the mean according to SAS this bar is the median third quartile first quartile looks like it may be slightly skewed negative we could of course determine that using the Hildebrand rule if we wanted to so first it's going to be a one sample ttest it's a new procedure we're going to Apophis eyes that the mean GPA is equal to three and so the setup for this test is proc ttest specify the data and then for that null hypothesis which is h0 we're gonna say it's equal to 3.0 so this line right here at this part of the line specifies the null hypothesis and the next line tells us what variable we want to test in this case it'll be GPA variable now will you run these three lines now we get a lot of output that seems to be SAS is modus operandi was to give a lot of output three tables and to graphics so let's look at the first table and this is a sample size mean this will be the sample mean standard deviation sample standard deviation set a standard error this is gonna be the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of an the minimum and maximum GPAs in the sample simple sample statistics second it's gonna be similar we're given the mean we've also got a 95% confidence interval for the mean we're 95% confident that the mean of the population is between two point nine seven seventy five and three point one seven three one we're given the standard deviation and we've got a 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation we're 95% confident that the population standard deviation is between point four three to nine and point five seven to eight that was table to table three gives results of the ttest degrees of freedom is DF this is equal to n minus one in this case Anna's one hundred one hundred minus one is that ninety nine T value is the test statistic value for this data pyaare greater than absolute value of t this will be the twotailed test the pvalue for that because P is greater than alpha we fail to reject the null hypothesis in other words if the ttest is appropriate for this data then concluding that the average GPA for all students in this population being 3 is reasonable we do not have sufficient evidence to say that it is unreasonable now note that the T test requires normality of the measurements that is it assumes that the GPAs came from a normal distribution this first graphic helps to illustrate or to graphically test that the histogram is from the data the blue curve is of the normal distribution and the pinkish reddish brownish whatever color that is ish curve is what's being observed so we're trying to compare the normal curve with the kernel curve if they perfectly overlap then it's guaranteed that this data came from a normal distribution they will never perfectly overlap but is it close enough and that's really what we're after here is is it close enough and I don't know just by looking at this I'd say now it really looks to be heavily skewed to the left so I don't think it's close enough I'm not positive though if this graphic doesn't do it for you here's the second graphic this is the quantile quantile plot of GPA if the data came from a normal distribution then those dots should line up along that diagonal line these dots along this diagonal line they won't ever perfectly be along the diagonal line but they should be close enough looking at this and it looks like there's a definite pattern here starts low goes high ends low this is a misses this indicates that the data are also left skewed so both of these indicate the data or are left skewed now the question is is are the data significantly less skewed and as we talked about in class one way that we can test that is using the Shapiro bulk test now to do that we have to run our proc univariate and we actually did do the Shapiro bulk tests but it was back in activity 1a it's proc univariate data equals stat data and then we add in normal VAR GPA because we're testing normality for the GPA variable so let's go ahead and run these lines here's the moments that should look familiar to us basic statistical measures should look familiar to us test for location remember last in in 1a I told you let's go ahead and skip over that test for normality is the new stuff Shapiro will test test statistic is w its value is 0.9 three eight seven nine eight the pvalue is point zero zero zero two because the pvalue is less than alpha in this case it's a lot less than alpha we reject the null hypothesis for the Shapiro Wilk test the null hypothesis is that the data came from a normally distributed population we reject that include the data did not come from a normally distributed population that means that the ttest is not appropriate since the ttest is not appropriate we may want to use the wilcoxon test which is also called the signedrank test same null hypothesis we're testing that the mean is equal to three for the GPA to do the wilcoxon test or the signedrank test use proc univariate specify the data add in two additional items on this line loc count and our null hypothesis here it's mu zero equals three for the ttest it was H zero equals three here it's mu zero equals three then on the next line specify the variable that you're interested in running that again since it is univariate procedure we're gonna get a lot of information the moments basic statistical measures test for location of mu zero equals three this is the table we want remember we're doing the wilcoxon test SAS calls it the signedrank test signedrank test is the bottom of the three it's value for the test statistic is 657 point five the pvalue is 0.02 0.03 y is equal to three so if the wilcoxon test is appropriate we can reject the null hypothesis note that this conclusion is different than the one we had with the ttest but we concluded the ttest was not an appropriate test because the data were not normally distributed here we've got the wilcoxon test we reject the null hypothesis but we really do need to test if the data come meet the requirements of the wilcoxon test or meet the assumption of the wilcoxon test which is the simple symmetry the data must come from a symmetric distribution now how can we do that well we choose the Hildebrand rule hildebrand rule is the mean minus the median and the absolute value of that divided by the standard deviation if that is less than 0.2 then the data are sufficiently symmetric it was greater than point to the data are not sufficiently symmetric in doing this calculation we find out that that ratio is 0.2 to 2 4 8 3 6 2 3 since that is greater than point to the data are not sufficiently symmetric the wilcoxon test is not appropriate if the wilcoxon test is not appropriate we're done we cannot test the mean of or learn about the mean of this of the population that gave us this data that is unless we actually know the distribution that gave us the data we don't but we can start doing some tests on the median and so the one that we're going to use is the median test what SAS calls the sign test it's also a part of proc univariate fact let's have the wilcoxon test up here and the code for the median test down here compare the two they should be exactly the same why should they be exactly the same because the code that gave us through cells for the wilcoxon test with the signedrank test also gave us the results for the sign test the median test so let's run those signedrank test was the wilcoxon test the sign test is the median test test statistic for the median test in this case is 12.5 the pvalue is 0.01 54 because the pvalue is less than alpha we reject the null hypothesis conclude that the median is not 3 and that's it we have gone through all that notice the process we followed we started with the ttest we looked at the assumption of the ttest which was that the data came from a normally distributed population we tested that assumption had the data passed the assumption we'd report the results of the ttest in this case the data did not pass that assumption so he moved on to the next more general test which was the wilcoxon test or the signedrank test we looked at the assumption of the wilcoxon test which was that the data came from a symmetric distribution we tested that using the Hildebrand rule we rejected that assumption therefore the wilcoxon test or the signedrank test was not appropriate so he moved on to the next more general test and this one actually was for the median also called the sign test no assumptions involved in this and from the results of the median test for the scientists we reject the null hypothesis that the median is indeed 3 and that's the median of the population is not 3 so those were the tests of center now let's look at tests of proportions proportions tests Leslie's it let's examine the gender variable and start out with typical graphic this will be a horizontal bar plot of gender we're not going to include the stats on it there we go female goes out that far male goes out that far and for all of these let's have our null hypothesis be that the proportion of females at Oklahoma State University is 40% so the first test for proportions is going to be called the binomial test no I'm sorry it's gonna be called the proportions test code for that it's proc freq not really surprising because we're dealing with categorical variable proc freq deals a lot with the categorical variables specifying the data set again the next line is can be tables gender / binomial P equals point four zero and this will make it this will actually give us the proportions test results run that we're given sample statistics for the gender variable in this sample there's 45 females 55 males that's the first table second table gives us the results of the test of the proportions test we'll use the for the I'm sorry this gives us the confidence interval so we'll go with the confidence intervals first we'll use the proportion ASC ASC stands for asymptotic standard error and the 95 lower and 95 upper so we're 95% confident that the true proportion of females at OSU Stillwater is between point three five two five and point five 475 the third table gives the results of our hypothesis test we hypothesized that P was equal to 0.4 twosided test gives a pvalue of 0.3 0 74 because this is greater than alpha we conclude that it's reasonable to conclude that the proportion of females at OSU Stillwater is 40% pretty straightforward you get the computer to do the calculations you interpret the results the one sample proportions test is actually an approximate test the exact test is called the binomial test the difference between the binomial test and the proportions test in SAS is simply the inclusion of a second line or an additional line exact binomial not for this line the two pieces of code will look exactly the same the output is going to be very similar as well this table is common between the two this table is common between the two and most of this table is common between the two the only difference is when you do the exact binomial test you also get the pvalues for the exact test these four numbers were from the proportions test these two are from the binomial test least these four numbers are for the confidence interval for the proportions test these are for the confidence interval for the exact binomial tests so we're 95% confident that the true proportion of females at OSU Stillwater is between 0.35 zero three and point five five to seven that's all there is to it those are the only two one sample proportions tests available the main difference between the two is that the binomial test assumes the data come from a binomial distribution that may or may not be true that's completely up to you and the definition of that binomial distribution the third set of tests that we're going to look at it's going to be the variance test for various reasons and I'll let you read that in the handout there is no builtin variance test in SAS you have to create your own so that's what we do here this is SAS programming this is actually very simple part of SAS programming I do not expect you to be able to program SAS just to use it and you know reality one sample variance test is rarely going to be done so consists of three blocks of code the first block of code calculates the sample variance and the sample size sample variance we're gonna call s VAR sample size we're gonna call n this line the output line actually saves that information from the proc univariate no print means we're not going to print anything out so you're just going to use it to save the sample variance and the sample size the second block uses the sample variance and sample size and your hypothesized variance to calculate the pvalue and the confidence interval these formulas come from the textbook by the way this is all done within a data step and at the end of this data step we're going to have a data set called VAR test results and then we print out of our test results the data set that we just created when we print it out we're gonna get values for the sample variance the sample size hypothesized value of the variance the test statistic the pvalue the lower confidence level and the upper confidence level highlight run and this is what prints up sample size is 100 sample variance was 0.243 1/2 the hypothesized variance was 0.33 test statistic calculated was 72 point nine three six zero corresponds to a pvalue of 0.05 eight to five and a confidence interval a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.18 74 to two point three to eight zero nine so we're 95% confident that the true population variance is between these two numbers we hypothesized it was 0.33 that's just outside the interval that gives us a pvalue point zero four five which is less than our usual alpha of 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis we conclude that according to the data it's unlikely that the population has a variance of 0.33 had we thought or believed or hypothesized at the population variance was 0.25 we could test that by going down here to the VAR zero line change that to 0.25 and rerun the whole set so for the second for the test that the population variance is 0.25 pvalue is 0.88 so we fail to reject that null hypothesis in fact every value between point 1 8 7 4 2 and point 3 2 809 is reasonable as a population variance and that's the end of this code this covers all of the one sample test that you would want to run and so while we're at it let's just go ahead and feed in acquit I'm showing you how to do two population procedures using SAS so that's go ahead and open up SAS again the log screen at the top the script screen down here so it's whatever is in this window is what you'll submit in your appendix let's go ahead and load the data it's going to be the stat grades data as expected you should be familiar with how to do all of this I'm going to add one more thing I'm gonna create a variable called got pass and we're gonna call it got pass because it's going to indicate whether or not the student passed or failed the course so we're gonna cut got PA SS I'm gonna say failed for everyone okay now when does a student actually fail well student fails if the grade is less than 70% so if the students grade is greater than or equal to 70% then got pass is going to be value passed we'll give her a title we'll be grades for stat 401 3 hopefully my fingers start working will proc print it just make sure everything's done and end with a run so we'll go ahead and highlight all this run it again remember you can either run it by clicking on the little running person at the top or f3 on the keyboard and here's what was printed out looks like everything's working right student got a 56 didn't pass student got a 72 passed so that's one way of creating or that's another way of creating new variables or new types of variables for your data set it's a very handy way at times so let's get a look at our data let's go ahead and say for everything we're going to do today or at least for the means part we're going to compare GPAs for males and females so first step side by side box plot remember to sort it first we're going to sort it by gender we're going to sort it by gender because our box plot is going to be one box plot for males on box plot for females instead of the forum GPA which is our measurement variable our dependent variable asterisk and then our grouping variable and as usual our box style it's going to be schematic that will allow the dots to indicate outliers let's run this and those are side by side box plots two outliers for females the little diamond is the met as the mean looks like the mean and the median for females bit higher than it is for males but the question is is it significantly higher we can also do the same thing or or look at the distribution of the data using histogram so here's how to do histograms again we got to make sure we sort it by gender its proc univariate the very variable we're gonna use is GPA and histogram and since and and let's go ahead and break it up by gender so this is going to give us two histograms one for females one for males here's the histogram for females this gram for males females look to be a bit more left skewed than the distribution males will find out if that's important so that was looking at the data the next step is to actually perform the tests so we're going to start with a two sample ttest and is expected it uses proc ttest data stated the variable is GPA and if we stop here with just proc ttest and var GPA we're gonna get the one sample ttest from the last video but if we specify class is gender then we're also going to be able to break it up between the two genders and get a two sample ttest output is a lot as usual let's go through the four tables first table gives statistic sample statistics for GPA for the females the mean is sick three point one six GPA for the male's whose mean is three point zero zero standard deviations errors men's maxes etc and also for the difference between females and males females are for this sample or females have for this sample an average GPA of 0.15 68 higher than that of males so first table gives us the sample statistics second table gives us some confidence intervals for the GPA for females we're 95% certain that the population mean is between 3.0 3 and 3.30 for males we're 95% confidence between 2.86 and three point 1 4 we can do that we have the same information for the standard deviation for the there are now two methods for the two sample ttest in the handout I explain what both of these methods are I'm going to highly suggest that you only use the Satterthwaite and I give some idea as to why with so using the Satterthwaite method the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means is from negative point zero three five seven two positive point three four nine three since zero is a part of that confidence interval we cannot state that there is a significant difference or a detected difference between the mean GPA for the two genders here this third table is a result of the ttest for both the pooled and the Satterthwaite method again I highly suggest using the Satterthwaite method degrees freedom for the Satterthwaite is ninety seven point five seven nine test statistic is one point six two the pvalue is 0.1 0.2 because P is greater than alpha we failed to reject the null hypothesis conclude that we did not detect a difference in GPA or an average GPA between the two genders then Table four gives us a statistical test for the Equality of variances it's the folded F test it's one of the available variance tests probably the pvalue is 0.35 0 4 3 5 0 3 because that's greater than alpha we fail to reject the null hypothesis conclude that the we did not detect any difference in the two variances the GPA variance for males and the GPA variance for a few minutes now as with the one sample ttest there is a requirement that the observations or the data are normally distributed in each of the two populations let me emphasize that it's in each of the two populations not all the GPAs are normally distributed but they're normally distributed for females and for males now we can do a normality test and again I recommend the Shapiro book test I'm notice again that this is very similar to what it was in the last video slash handout the only difference again is the class gender is added we're specifying that we want to break these up these these normality tests up along the gender again lots and lots of output okay for gender equals female Shapiro Wilk tests pvalue is less than alpha so we can conclude that the GPAs do not come from a normal distribution for females now if we scroll down for the male's look at the same thing Shapiro will test pvalues point zero five one six that's pretty close we do not have evidence that the male GPAs come from anything other than a normal distribution so females were a failure in terms of distribution males were not a failure in terms of distribution but both male GPAs and female GPAs have to come from a normal distribution in order for the ttest to be appropriate since the females do not we cannot use the two sample ttest so what do we do we use the mannwhitney wilcoxon test you can compare this code with it's a analogy from the last handout and the difference is only the class gender and par stands for nonparametric oneway procedure statistics about the males and the females here's the test SAS calls that the wilcoxon two sample test test statistic is 2500 four point five the test statistic for since we were testing difference it's gonna be twosided or twotailed test pvalue is 0.1 0 8 5 since P is greater than alpha we fail to reject the null hypothesis we don't have evidence that males and females have different average GPAs here we could also use the kruskalwallis test which is a little bit less powerful but a bit more exact that pvalue is point one oh seven eight and even though it's called the kruskalwallis test this is actually the mannwhitney wilcoxon test in this box they were approximations this is the exact so pvalues 0.107 eight again failed to reject the null hypothesis do not be surprised that this p value for the kruskalwallis test the p value for the t approximation and the p value for the normal approximation are pretty close large sample size means that those three are going to start becoming closer and closer and closer and there's our paired ttest so those were the two ways of testing whether or not the means the two distributions were equal or the means of the two measurements are equal the mean of GPA for males versus mean of GPA for females let's move on to proportions test now and let's look at the pass rate for males versus the pass rate for females so let's start as usual with looking at our data it's a twoway graphic the bar it's gonna be vertical bars I'm gonna group it by got pass so for those who failed overwhelmingly male for those who passed overwhelmingly female just by looking at this graphic we have an idea that there is a significant difference the test we're going to use is in some areas called the two sample proportions test in other areas it's called a chisquared test we'll call it both tables gender star got pass and chisquared goes after that Zhi sq because this is a chisquared test get three tables this will be our frequency table this will be for the chisquared table and the one that you'll want to look at is just the chisquared that's the first row and if you want to you can look up Fisher's exact test to see what that's all about the test statistic for the chisquare test is twentyseven point two four zero three that corresponds to a pvalue of less than one in ten thousand since the pvalue is less than alpha we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that there is a significant difference in pass rates between males and females we have to go to this table to interpret it even more of those who passed so we're calling looking at this column and it'll be the third fourth yes the fourth value of the Cole percent of those who passed thirty six sixty three sorry sixty three percent were female and 36% were male if the number of mails and number of females are equal that has meaning we can look at the Roper sense which means that females of all the females ninety three point three three percent passed and of all the males forty three point six four percent passed that's a little bit more meaningful in general terms the column percents really do require that the number of males and number of females are equal the row persons do not and the last test that we're gonna look at is the variance test we're gonna compare the variance of males versus the variances of females GPAs and if we've actually saw seen this test already its back in the pre tests this is that fourth table the Equality of variances test here SAS wants us to use the folder def test the test statistic is one point three two the pvalue is 0.35 zero three because P is greater than alpha we fail to reject the null hypothesis we have not detected a difference in the variances of GPAs between males and females now honestly variants of GPA not that important but variance is also measure of risk in the stock market so instead of thinking of male and female GPAs think of price of IBM versus price of Apple you would want the you would generally all things being equal you would generally want the lower variance stock but do analysis variance and multiple comparisons using SAS this really is just an introduction to it so the first thing we've got to do as usual is import the data we're going to use the usual data set the stat grades data set and again click on the little running person appear or f3 on your keyboard looks like everything came in crack Lee's do a proc print just to doublecheck just to get a feel for the data and remember you always want to get a feel for the data observations and identical identify our grade gender or GPA college one thing you'll notice is that there's only one lasso person in this group so if we're trying to determine the effect of college on grade or see if there's different grades for different colleges having one person from lasso is not going to give us enough information about lasso so let's take less oh and bundle it with all the other group now let me show you how to do that to recode lasso into other so we'll go back up here to the data step so what are we going to do we're going to see which of those have College equal to lasso and then change those color college to other that's all we're doing there we go so if the college value is less so then we're going to make the college value other if college isn't less so that it's not going to do anything and notice down here the last so person is now an other person so we just recoated part of our data that will be very useful in the future for you and all of your data analysis there are many ways of doing it this is just one of them okay get to know your data so let's go ahead and look at some graphics histogram we're gonna do histograms by college so we're going to have five history M's hmmm that doesn't look right what's wrong it's not sorted in ascending sequence ah that's right we have to sort by college before we can do a histogram so it's just proc sort now we've got it so here's business here's arts and sciences that looks really normal here's college of agricultural science and natural resource education either that one looks pretty normal too we could also do box plots sidebyside boxplots get a little feel looks like the average for Kassner and EDR higher than everything else well this is GPA we're looking at grade let's rerun those there we go looks like castner's average which is the Dimond is much higher than any others looks like business is much lower than all the others so already we have an idea that perhaps there is an effect or a differential effect of college on grade that Kasner students seem to do much better than business students well let's figure this out let's do one way ANOVA and it's called one way ANOVA because we have one independent variable its proc GL m GL M stands for generalized linear models give it data specify the class and class again is the categorical variable college and then the model the model is going to be the dependent variable equal sign independent variable or in this framework it's going to be the measurement equal sign grouping variable and then we run it and then because of some internal features with the GLM process we're gonna have to do a quit immediately after I guess half two is not the right word but that's all there is to it here's the results of the GLM procedure here's the first page tells us there are five levels in the College Business Arts and Sciences Casner education and other there were 100 observations that are read and we were able to use all of them this is the usual ANOVA table the source the degrees of freedom sum of squares the main square the F value all those we calculated in class and then the pvalue pvalue is less than alpha therefore we reject the null hypothesis again in this case the null hypothesis is that all the means are equal these two tables give different types of sums of squares since we're doing oneway analysis of variance these will give an absolutely no additional information if you move on to twoway and above analysis variance these will give additional information but since we only do one way in this course we'll have to postpone discussing that until statistics for experimenters to here's the histogram I mean I'm sorry box plots sidebyside box plot again the diamonds are the means the horizontal bar here is the median this also gives the test statistic F is ten point one eight F is ten point one eight and the pvalue in this case again less than alpha so we've now concluded that assuming an analysis of variance is the correct procedure to use here we've we're able to conclude that at least one of the five colleges has a different average grade so let's test the assumptions remember that there are two main assumptions above and beyond the usual assumption of Independence the first is the assumption of normality we remember how to do that from earlier sort it by college proc univariate and then give it normal now Oprah give the normality tests several normality test I call it the one that we're going to be using will be the Shapiro Wilk test also note that there's five tests being performed here one for each of the colleges therefore you should multiply the pvalues for this pure Wilk test by five here's the pvalue for the Shapiro will test for college business we don't have evidence that it's non normal the next one is for college of Arts and Sciences there's a pvalue 0.3 multiply that by five that's also greater than alpha therefore no evidence of non normality for the College of Arts and Sciences college of agricultural science and natural resource multiply that pvalue by five again because there's five tests five normality test we're running there's no evidence of non normality for Kasner education 0.347 seven times five also greater than alpha and finally the other group point nine one five five again greater than alpha you multiply that by five greater than alpha so no evidence of non normality which means that this model and this data passed that assumption test the other assumption test is equality of variance in the populations and the five populations here there's many ways of testing for equality of variances what's actually called homogeneity of variance we're going to use the basic Levine test to do the Levine tests notice that the first three lines again are just the same as the proxy lemma from above we're really just adding this new line the means line states the grouping variable HOV test is homogeneity of variance test and we're gonna have sastra and Levine tests being offers several types I'm we're gonna be used type equals square so it's going to be squares of the measurements instead of the absolute values we'll run that output from the GLM procedure starts way up here five levels that's familiar this is also familiar from the last GLM proc that we ran this is well here's the new line Levine's test for homogeneity of grade variance so it tells us immediately that the null hypothesis is that the variances are the same how much Genie experiences are the same so we look to see if we can reject that null hypothesis there's the pvalue it's 0.8 0.8 is greater than point zero five which is our alpha therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis therefore this data and model passed this assumption test as well so it passed the normality tests and it passed the Levine homogeneity test so it passes all of those assumption tests which means that analysis variance actually was the correct procedure or we are allowed to use it and we're able to conclude that at least one of the means is different from the others that's all we're able to conclude right now one of the means is different from the others we don't know which means we just know that at least one could be two could be three but at least one is different from all the others all that work and that's all we're able to conclude that's fine the next step is to determine which is different and not just which is different but which is different and in which way how are we going to do that gannets the proxy LM these three lines are going to be exactly the same as before we add in this new line means college is going to be the categorical variable and then after the slash is going to be the multi multiple comparison test we want to use we're gonna use the Tukey HSD test let me run those lines we get a lot of output let's see where do we start we start back here same output same output for the GLM's same output for the cheap Prachi LM nothing there is difference here's the new part two key studentized range HS d test four great specifies at alpha is 0.05 error degrees of freedom error means square we calculated it those in class critical value we also calculated in class that was a lot of work SAS does it all for you but the drawback is you've got this incredibly large table that you have to interpret so how do you do that the way that I do it is I look to see they look for the stars the stars indicate that the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level in other words for this one we know that Kassner cast is significantly different from zero which means since the difference actually is positive Kasner has a statistically higher average grade than cast students since Castro caste is positive Kastner is greater than kiss and a statistically significant level and since that difference is eleven point three nine one I'd say that's the practically significant level as well Kassner is also greater than other Kassner is greater than business buy a whole lot Kassner is not significantly higher than education no stars here therefore this difference is not significantly different from zero there's no detected difference between the average caster grade and the average education grade so Kasner is not significantly different from education but it is higher significantly higher than Arts and Sciences other in business we know from here that education is significantly higher than business we know that Arts and Sciences is significantly less than Casner which we knew from above you know Arts and Sciences is significantly higher than business other is significantly lower than Kasner which we also know from above and business is significantly less than every other college so here's what we can conclude from this business is significantly less in terms of average grade than all the other colleges Kazon area is significantly more than all the other colleges in terms of average grade except for education and there's no significant difference between the education arts and sciences and other it's kind of interesting business the lowest Kastner the highest except it may not be higher than education so that was multiple comparisons and we can do multiple comparisons if we reject the null hypothesis of analysis of variance if after and we do analysis of variance in the pvalue is greater than alpha we conclude that there's no detected two difference amongst the several pop subpopulations if we failed to detect a difference it doesn't make sense to then go and look for a difference by doing multiple comparisons finally remember there were two assumptions for analysis of variance there's equality variances and the normality if any of those are violated by the data in the model you can't use analysis variance you'll use what's called the critical Wallis test here's what you would run this looks very familiar to us it's very similar to what we've done with the two sample tests Act I think the code is exactly the same the only difference is the class variable college in this case has more than two levels so SAS knows to run a kruskalwallis tests on it P is less than alpha reject the null hypothesis of equal means and therefore conclude that at least one of the means is different from the others we do multiple comparisons with kruskalwallis test absolutely and I encourage you to take the nonparametric scores where we covered how to do that new short little video on SAS where we talk about correlation and regression at times we may be faced with examining the relationship between two quantitative or numeric variables the relationship between them not the variables themselves but their relationship correlation can be used to determine if such a relationship exists and linear regression can be used to say the nature of that relationship we're gonna use SAS to do just that so let's go ahead and begin by importing the usual stat grades data set nothing special file name data step don't need to change state at all of course we should probably determine if we import it correctly and do a proc print let's run it and make sure everything looks good no errors at the top and it's gonna pop up with the HTML page everything looks fine notice we didn't change the other we didn't change the lasso to other we're not studying the colleges so we don't need to do that if we were studying the colleges we may need to do that in the future but we're not so we don't as always let's go ahead and plot our data I'm going to do a really massive block of code here just to show you some of the strengths of sass and its graphing it's kind of odd up until recently saying sass is good at graphing would get you laughed at but I'll go ahead and highlight all this and run it let's look at the graphic we got xaxis this will be the independent variable here is the initial grade point average yaxis is the dependent variable course grade earned we've got this broken up into red female figures for the females and blue male figures for the males if we look there looks to be a positive correlation between the two I'm not sure that it is statistically significant but it looks like there is notice that both the initial grade point average and the course grade earned start at zero and it starts exactly at zero so how did I get this happen let's go through this code a little bit line by line these two lines look familiar from 1b you can find two symbols symbol one we're called we're gonna make red make it a little bit you a bigger than usual 75% bigger than usual now we're gonna give it the value star which actually is the female figure and we're going to find simple 2 is blue make it also 75% bigger and that'll be the value is equal to the greater than sign which is the male figure symbol 1 symbol 2 so when we do the plotting and down here we set it equal to gender so it's going to split up into the two genders symbol 1 will correspond to the first gender symbol 2 will correspond to the second gender y is female the first male the second the alphabet these two lions are going to be new they define two different axes axis one we're going to define as being ranging from zero to ten to 100 and marks every ten and we're going to actually start it at zero we're not going to have any padding on the top of the bottom axis two is going to range from zero to four I'm gonna have Mark's major marks every one and again it's going to go directly to the edges offset is zero we're gonna utilize those two axes in the plot statement the vertical axis is X is 1 the horizontal axis that's H axis is access to the next thing that you'll notice it's the legend command here we're just saying where we're going to put the legend we're at the position we're gonna place it'll be the top center and on the outside of the plot and we're going to use that in the plot statement down here we're going to define where the legend is now the proxy plot also also came from sass 1b and this part came from sass 1b what the no frame does in the plot statement is gets rid of the box around the plotting region now if you notice I actually have initial grade point average stated down here and course grade earned stated up there and student gender stated up there if we didn't this would just be little cheat loopy delay and little grade and little gender to make it a bit more reader friendly we're going to say okay that GPA is actually going to be replaced by initial grade point average grade is going to be replaced by course grade earned and gender is going to be replaced by student gender so that's what all those parts mean when you put them together produces this really interesting graphic I think it's worth the extra steps okay now we've looked at it we do think there may be a correlation if there is a correlation it's positive as the G initial GPA increases the course grade earned also increases let's go ahead and test that we're gonna use the proc Corps which we saw back in one a proc Corps specify the data I'm gonna specify there are two variables that we want to find the correlation between and Fisher is going to allow us to get some more statistics off of it highlight run here's the onepage output two variables grade and GPA we have some summary statistics for both of those two variables we have the correlation coefficient based on Fisher for the two variables grade and GPA have a correlation of 0.33 5 5 8 the pvalue for the tests that that correlation is actually zero is point zero zero zero six since that is less than alpha we failed we reject the null hypothesis conclude that there is a relationship between these two variables we have a 95% confidence interval from point 1 4 7 to 0.49 8 where 95% confident that the true relationship between those two is between those two values again since the pvalue for the test of H not Rho equals zero is less than alpha we know that it is not zero back in one a we talked about the correlation and looked only at the value of the correlation we didn't talk about that test statistic or the confidence it rules because it didn't make sense we didn't understand those terms back then now we do so it's kind of nice to go back over some things that we've done in the past and look at it with new eyes because we've learned stuff since then so we've got something quarter we got a quart a significant correlation between the two but we're not exactly sure I mean that's that's good information but we'd like to go to the next step we'd like to model that dependent variable the great earned in the class using the independent variable the initial GPA to do that we'll use linear regression we've seen this before proc GLM state the data the model grade is the dependent variable the Y variable GPA is the independent variable and we could just run it see L parm gives us confidence intervals for the parameters where have we seen proc GLM before we've seen it when we were dealing with analysis of variance the last in the last video the difference between this use of GLM proc GLM and that use of Park GLM is this use approach GM is missing a line there is no class line here or class statement because neither great nor GPA are categorical variables so let's run this the output should be pretty familiar to us since we've already seen proc GLM's page 1 number of observations number of observations used it's been an entire page on that page 2 is the big one here's the ANOVA table P values point zero zero zero six since P is less than alpha we know that this model does tell us something about the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable if this p value were greater than alpha we'd say that this model was not useful next table gives us the rsquared negotiate coefficient of variation and a couple other things that are useful for a different snack course we've got the two types of we got two types of sums of squares if we had more than one independent variable this might be useful we don't notice that these two tables will give us exactly the same information as the first row of the top table only because we have one independent variable one dependent variable this table is the new table this gives us parameter estimates the estimates are here this is b0 it's the estimate for beta naught and this is b1 the estimate for beta 1 there's the test statistics the pvalues both are less than alpha therefore neither of these are 0 and we got confidence interval if we didn't have the CL parm we would not have these confidence limits we also have the graphic nice little basic graphic the line it's going to be the line of best fit the equation for this line of best fit is forty six point four one five plus eight point four two zero two times X is equal to Y B not plus b1 x equals y the shaded area is the confidence interval or the confidence band for the line the best fit for TS stat 4043 discusses that and the dashed line gives us prediction limits which are also discussed in stat 40 43 so based on that those two tests we know that there is a linear there is a relationship between these two variables in fact we were able to determine what that relationship was this these two numbers give us the line of best fit which means for every one increase in GPA the expected value of the grade in the class goes up by eight point four two points on average now if we look back at our plot see if I can pull up the plot if we look back at this there seems to be some difference between females and males in terms of course grade earned it seems as though females did better than males so let's add gender as one of our independent variables that's called multiple linear regression because we have more than one independent variable and since we are doing this by gender we need to sort it first proc GLM by gender means that we're going to first fit the model with females then fit the model with males and then we'll be able to compare the two everything else is exactly the same as the simple linear regression above go ahead and run that scroll to the top okay GLM for procedure for females 45 females red 45 were used pvalue for the model of point zero zero seven one model is useful scroll down to the parameter estimates 53.1 nine is the estimate for beta not eight point six to six is the estimate for beta one on average for every one increase in GPA for females the grade goes up by eight point six two both of these are statistically significant that is that they are different from zero for the GPA that test actually has some meaning for the intercept usually it's not from a science standpoint it's not interesting if the intercept is different from zero but almost always it's interesting if the slope or the effect is different from zero so that was it for females let's scroll down see what happens with males 5555 pvalue is 0.07 63 which means this model doesn't really do much for the males we do still have the estimate of our estimate of beta naught and beta 1 on average for this sample as you increase the GPA by 1 the grade goes up by four point six seven but if we look at the pvalue that pvalue for the effect is greater than alpha which means that it is not significantly different from zero meaning that we cannot conclude GPA has an effect on grade four males scrolling up we do see that it has an effect on grade four females it just does not have an effect on grade four males in fact we're 95% confident that the effect is similar between a negative onehalf and a positive nine point nine in other words as the great as the GPA goes up by one for males it could actually go the grade could actually go down by 0.5 points or it could go up by about 10 points rather interesting rather contrary to what you may think it seems as though the GPA has sheep a goes up the grade should go up now notice that what I haven't said here I have not said that increasing GPA causes the grade to go go up I'm just stating it there is a very strong relationship between the two it is quite likely that there is a third variable what's called a confounding variable that causes both GPA to go up and grade to go up now if you sit and think about it for a moment you'll think hmm that makes sense maybe work ethic would cause the GPA to go higher and the grade in snack class to go higher could be natural gifts that would cause both to go up not sure that's for different analysis for this analysis we just looked at GPA and grade and we did all this using sass notice the important processes procore gives us the correlations at times we may be faced with examining the relationship between two categorical variables the relationship not the variables themselves in such case we want to do a chisquare test of Independence other times we're looking at one categorical variable with more than two possible outcomes and we want to hypothesize something about the relationship of those outcomes in those cases we've used the chisquared goodness fit test so we're gonna start with the chisquare goodnessoffit test then we'll move on to the chisquared test of independence well technically first thing we're gonna do is start up SAS and load in our data it's gonna be the usual stat grades data we are going to need to use the dichotomous variable so we're gonna use got pass can be defined as whether or not the students grade was greater than 70 also we're gonna be dealing with the college variable so we need to recode that student who was glassoh into other that's proc print it just make sure we did it correctly it looks like everything's working got past is their college we're all good to go and so the next next thing to do as always is to learn about your data to see your data to plot your data so we're gonna look at gender so that next question here is gender gender across the colleges this would be an interesting question some beta somebody may hypothesize that certain genders prefer different colleges over others so to do this we'll do a proc G chart it's gonna be a horizontal bar plot of gender we're gonna group it by college and we're gonna put spaces between the college groups of size five and those here's what we get it looks like overall there's not much difference between males and females in each of the colleges there could be but it doesn't look like there is much of a significant difference looks like maybe males over females in college of business and maybe females or males and our Kasner but I'm not exactly sure those differences are statistically significant to test if the distribution of genders across the different colleges is equal we'd use a chisquared test of Independence which will be part three but on the way there we can go ahead and look at distribution of the colleges perhaps we want to look at the distribution of the genders hypothesized about those so let's look at the distribution of the colleges now since we're looking at the distribution of the college is we're not grouping by anything at this point that's that'll be the code looks like Arts and Sciences has a lot of students which doesn't really surprise us because in most colleges most University is the College of Arts and Sciences is the most populous but we could test the null hypothesis that the proportion of students in business is equal to the proportion of students in Arts and Sciences is equal to the proportion of students in Kastner is able as a proportion of students in education is able to proportion of students and others that is a student is equally likely to choose any of those five colleges or groupings of colleges since we're testing if the student is equally likely on this one categorical variable we're gonna do a chisquare goodnessoffit test as a proc freq because we're dealing with the categorical variable tables college saw this back in 1a the new thing is /ky C stands for chisquared that tells SAS that you want to you do a chisquare goodnessoffit test it knows it's a chisquared test because you told a chisquare it knows it's a goodness of fit test because it is a single variable since we specify nothing beyond the keisker then it's going to by default test equal probabilities we'll run this we get this output first table gives us the raw frequencies for sense the second gives us the result with the hypothesis test this is a chisquare tests for equal proportions pvalue is less than alpha therefore we reject the null hypothesis of equal proportions test statistics 86 degrees freedom is for because there were five groups this graph shows the deviations from equal probabilities arson science is very very large deviation positive that is they have many many more students than they would if the null hypothesis were true and the other four colleges have fewer if the null hypothesis were true but because P is less than alpha we reject the null hypothesis hypothesis and conclude that the colleges do not have students in equal proportions it doesn't surprise us ours and sciences tends to have six times the students of any other college in most universities so to test that let's hypothesize that arts and sciences does have six times more students than any other college still proc freq still tables of college still keiskei but the new part we're adding in is this the testing proportions is 0.1 or 10% 0.6 point one point one point one these have to add up to 1 the order is based on the table business first arts and science the second Kasner followed by ad followed by other so where I pas the sizing business is 10% Arts and Sciences is 60 Kassner 60 ad is 60 others I'm sorry 10% 10% and others 10% and we would make this null hypothesis just by our experience that Arts and Sciences tends to have six times the students as any other college running it we running it if I push the right button there you go frequency distribution chisquared test test for the specified proportions the test percent is given up here 10% 60% 10 10 10 the pvalue is greater than alpha therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis this distribution of percents is reasonable given our data notice I did not say this is the correct proportion distribution only that this distribution is reasonable given our data and while it may look like business has a very large deviation compared to what we had under Arts and Sciences Arts and Sciences was off by 2 on this relative deviation on these businesses only off by 0.3 it says off by it even less than 1/6 this model is a much better fit these proportions these hypothesized proportions fit the data much better than did the equal proportions again I have to emphasize we are not saying that these proportions are the correct proportions we're saying that they're reasonable given our data statistics is usually about what is likely not what is possible think about that for a moment let's move on to tests of Independence test of Independence happen between two variables let's go ahead and look at gender versus college create a nice little cross tabulation it's gonna be a proc freq tables notice there's no slash or anything after it because we just want those cross tabulations here's crosstabulation referred to 1a as how to read these numbers now to tests if those two categorical variables are independent what do you think we're going to do yes we're going to add on that slash and keisker this gave us a cross tabulation up here this gives us the test for independence notice the only difference is the slash and the here's the cross tabulation again here the here is the results for the test of Independence between the two variables the one I want you to pay attention to is this chisquared test statistic the value is four point two six seven four in class we saw how to calculate that the pvalue is 0.37 100 because pvalue is greater than alpha we fail to reject the null hypothesis we cannot conclude that there is a relationship between these two categorical variables another way of saying that is we cannot conclude that different genders choose the different colleges at different rates that's proportion of males to females and Arts and Sciences is not significantly different than the proportion of males to females in business or in Kasner or an education or in the other group we don't have evidence that females choose one over the other or males avoid one over the other another way of thinking of this is if I asked you to predict somebody's college I'm just telling you this is a college student your prediction is most likely the College of Arts and Sciences 57 percent of our sample chose Arts and Sciences and now I say okay given that the person is female what's the most likely given that the student is female well we just showed that given that additional information gives us no new information in terms of predicting college it's just as useful for predicting college as the number of toes on the left foot the two variables are independent okay what may be interesting or more interesting it's not gender versus college but remember this is classroom these are students in my class and we can also look at whether or not how students pass a different rate in different colleges so instead of gender by college I've got got passed by college here's the crosstabulation chisquared tests couldn't have is 0.0 0.2 null hypothesis therefore these two categorical variables are not independent they are not independent which means that the pass rate differs across the colleges the pass rate differs across the colleges or technically at least one college has a pass rate that differs from the others that really doesn't surprise us if we look at the cross tabulation almost 77% of the business students failed to pass almost 70% of the Arts and Science students passed ninety one percent almost of Kassner students passed so just by looking at the cross tabulation it doesn't surprise us to think that we're going to conclude that there's a differential pass rate not at all kind of makes you think why do business students pass at a much lower rate than the other colleges hmm but that's a question for science not statistics for statistics we just said there's that differential pass rate science needs to come along and explain why and that's the end in this we loaded the data we looked at the data
