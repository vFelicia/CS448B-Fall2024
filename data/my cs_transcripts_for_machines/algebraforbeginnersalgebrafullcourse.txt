this video is about the exponent rules rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth or x to the n two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times 2 written 5 times and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself n times when we write these expressions the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself is called the base and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying the base by itself is called the exponent sometimes the exponent is also called the power the product rule says that if i have x to the power of n times x to the power of m that's the same thing as x to the n plus m power in other words when i multiply two expressions with the same base then i can add their exponents for example if i have 2 cubed times 2 to the 4th that's equal to 2 to the 7th and that makes sense because 2 cubed times 2 to the 4th means i multiply 2 by itself 3 times and then i multiply that by 2 multiplied by itself 4 times and in the end i have 2 multiplied by itself 7 times which is 2 to the 7th i'm just adding up the number of times that's multiplied in each piece to get the number of times that's multiplied total the quotient rule says that if i have x to the n power divided by x to the m power that's equal to x to the n minus m power in other words if i divide two expressions with the same base then i can subtract their exponents for example 3 to the 6th divided by 3 squared is going to be 3 to the 6 minus 2 or 3 to the 4th and this makes sense because 3 to the 6 means i multiply 3 by itself 6 times and then i divide that by 3 multiplied by itself twice so when i cancel out 3s i have 4 3s left notice that i have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom from the number of threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining that's why i subtract my exponents the power rule tells us if i have x to the n power raised to the m power that's the same thing as x to the n times m power in other words when i raise a power to a power i get to multiply the exponents for example 5 to the 4th cubed is equal to 5 to the 4 times 3 or 5 to the 12th and this makes sense because 5 to the 4th cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth times five to the fourth times five to the fourth expanding this out some more that's five times five times five times five times the same thing times the same thing again so i have three groups of four fives which is a total of three times four or twelve fives the next rule involves what happens when i raise a number or a variable to the zeroth power it turns out that anything to the zeroth power is equal to one usually this is just taken as a definition but here's why it makes sense to me if you have something like 2 cubed divided by 2 cubed well certainly that has to equal 1 anything divided by itself is just one but using the quotient rule we know that this is the same thing as 2 to the 3 minus 3 because when we divide two things with the same base we get to subtract their exponents therefore this is the same thing as 2 to the 0 so 2 to the 0 has to equal 1 in order to make it work with the quotient rule and the same argument shows that anything to the zero power has to be equal to one what happens when we take something to a negative power x to the n is equal to one over x to the n again most people just take this as a definition of a negative exponent but here's why it makes sense if i take something like 5 to the 7th times 5 to the negative 7th then by the product rule this has to equal 5 to the 7 plus negative 7 which is 5 to the 0 and we just said that that is equal to 1. now i have the equation of 5 to the seventh times five to the negative seventh equals one if i divide both sides by five to the seventh i get that five to the negative seventh has to equal one over five to the seventh so that's where this rule about negative exponents comes from it has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule finally let's look at fractional exponents what does an expression like x to the 1 over n really mean well it means the nth root of x for example 64 to the onethird power means the cube root of 64 which happens to be 4. and 9 to the onehalf means the square root of 9 which is usually written without that little superscript up there now the square root of 9 is just 3. fractional exponents also make sense for example if i have five to the one third and i cube that then by the power rule that's equal to five to the onethird times three which is just five to the one or five so in other words five to the one third is the number that when you cube it you get five and that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five the cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it you get 5. the next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product in other words if we have a product x times y all raised to the nth power that's equal to x to the n times y to the n for example 5 times 7 all raised to the third power is equal to 5 cubed times 7 cubed and this makes sense because 5 times 7 all raised to the cubed power can be expanded as 5 times 7 times 5 times 7 times 5 times 7 but if i rearrange the order of multiplication this is the same thing as five times five times five times seven times seven times seven or five cubed times seven cubed similarly we could distribute an exponent of our quotient if we have the quotient x over y all raised to the n power that's the same as x to the n over y to the n for example 2 7 raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth over seven to the fifth this makes sense because twosevenths to the fifth can be expanded as twosevenths multiply by itself five times which can be written rewritten as two multiplied by itself five times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times and that's two to the fifth over seven to the fifth as wanted we've seen that we can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division but be careful because we cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction for example a plus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n plus b to the n a minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus b to the n and if you're not sure just try an example with numbers for example 2 plus 3 squared is not the same thing as 2 squared plus 3 squared and 2 minus 3 squared is definitely not equal to 2 squared minus 3 squared in this video i gave eight exponent rules which i'll list again here there's the product rule the quotient rule the power rule the zero exponent the negative exponent the fractional exponent and the the two rules involving distributing exponents across multiplication and division in another video i'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify expressions involving exponents in this video i'll work out some examples of simplifying expressions using exponent rules i'll start by reviewing the exponent rules the product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base you add the exponents the quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base you subtract the exponents the power rule says that when you take a power to a power you multiply the exponents the power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one as long as the base is not zero since zero to the zero is undefined it doesn't make sense negative exponents to evaluate x to the minus n we take the reciprocal one over x to the n to evaluate a fractional exponent like x to the one over n we take the nth root of x we can distribute an exponent over a product a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times b to the n and we can distribute an exponent over a quotient a over b to the n is a to the n over b to the n in the rest of this video we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions for our first example we want to simplify 3 times x to the minus 2 divided by x to the fourth there's several possible ways to proceed for example we could use the negative exponent rule to write x to the minus 2 as 1 over x squared all that gets divided by x to the fourth still notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared the 3 stays where it is and that's because the exponent of negative 2 only applies to the x not to the 3. now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1 we have a product of two fractions in our numerator and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the denominators which is 3 over x squared all divided by x to the fourth i can think of x to the fourth as x to the fourth over one so now i have a fraction over a fraction which i can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal that simplifies to three times 1 divided by x squared times x to the 4th which is 3 over x to the 6th using the product rule since x squared times x to the 4th is equal to x to the 2 plus 4 or x to the 6th an alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule i can rewrite this as 3 times x to the minus 2 over x to the 4th and by the quotient rule that's 3 times x to the minus 2 minus 4 or 3 times x to the minus 6. now using the negative exponent rule x to the minus six is one over x to the sixth and this product of fractions simplifies to three over x to the sixth the same answer i got before the second problem can be solved in similar ways please pause the video and try it before going on one way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus 5 as one over y to the fifth thinking of this as a fraction divided by a fraction i can multiply by the reciprocal and get 4 y cubed y to the fifth over 1 by the product rule the numerator here is for y to the 8th and so my final answer is just 4y to the 8th alternatively i could decide to use the quotient rule first as in the previous problem i can write this as 4 y cubed minus negative 5 by the quotient rule and so that's 4 y to the 8th as before i'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems kind of a shortcut method before we go on that shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent in the numerator corresponds to a positive exponent in the denominator for example the x to the negative 2 in the numerator here after some manipulations became an x to the positive 2 in the denominator furthermore a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a positive exponent in the numerator that's what happened when we had the y to the negative 5 in the denominator and translated into a y to the positive 5 in the numerator sometimes people like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across the fraction bar by switching the sign of the exponent that is making a positive exponent negative or a negative exponent positive let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving these two problems in the first problem 3x to the minus 2 over x to the 4 we can move the negative exponent in the numerator and make it a positive exponent of the denominator so we get 3 over x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6th in the second example 4y cubed over y to the minus 5 we can change the y to the minus 5 in the denominator into a y to the 5 in the numerator and get our final answer of 4 y to the 3 plus 5 or 8. we'll use this principle again in the next problems in this example notice that i have i have y's in the numerator and in the denominator and also z's in the numerator and in the denominator in order to simplify i'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator or the denominator and similarly for the z's since i have more y's in the denominator let me move this y to the 3 downstairs and make it a y to the negative 3. i'm using the principle here that a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a negative exponent in the denominator now since i have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent of the denominator and i want to get rid of negative exponents i'm going to pass the z's to the numerator as e to the minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z to the plus 2 in the numerator notice that my number 7 doesn't move and when i do any of these manipulations because it doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative 2 for example only applies to the z not to the 7. now that i've got all my z's in the numerator and all my y's in the denominator it's easy to clean this up using the product rule and i have my simplified expression in this last example we have a complicated expression raised to a fractional power i'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses i can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents at the same time in other words i can rewrite this as 25 x to the fourth i'll bring the y to the minus 5 downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and make it x to the 6th the numerator and then i still have the y cubed on the denominator all that's raised to the three halves power using the product rule i can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient when i distribute my threehalves power i get 25 to the threehalves times x to the tenth to the threehalves divided by y to the eighth to the threehalves the power rule tells me when i have a power to a power i get to multiply the exponents so i can rewrite this as 25 to the three halves times x to the 10 times three halves over y to the eighth times three halves in other words twenty five to the three halves times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth finally i need to rewrite twenty five to the three halves since three halves can be thought of as three times onehalf or as onehalf times three i can write 25 to the threehalves as 25 to the 3 times onehalf or as 25 to the onehalf times three well using the power rule in reverse i can think of this as 25 cubed to the onehalf or as 25 to the onehalf cubed since when i take a power to a power i multiply the exponents 25 cubed to the onehalf might be hard to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge number but 25 to the onehalf is just the square root of 25 so i have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed which is 125. therefore my original expression is going to be 125 x to the 15 over y to the 12th in this video we use the exponent rules to simplify complicated expressions this video goes through a few tricks for simplifying expressions with radicals in them recall that this notation means the nth root of x so this notation here means the cube root of eight the number that when you cube it you get eight that number would be two when we write the root sign without a little number that just means the square root so the two is implied in this case the square root of 25 is 5 since 5 squared is 25. let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions first if we have the radical of a product we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals for example the square root of 9 times 16 is the same thing as the square root of 9 times the square root of 16. you can check that both of these evaluate to 12. similarly it's possible to distribute a radical sign across division the radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by the radical of b for example the cube root of 64 over eight is the same thing as the cube root of 64 over the cube root of 8 and you can check that both of these evaluate to 2. you have to be a little bit careful though because it's not ok to distribute a radical sign across addition in general the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a plus the nth root of b and similarly it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction if you're ever in doubt you can always check with simple examples for example the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the same thing as a square root of one plus a squared of one the right side evaluates to one plus one or two and the left side is square root of two and the irrational number the second expression to show that that fails i don't think it will work to use the square root of one minus one it'll actually hold in that case but i can show it's false by using say the square root of two minus one which does not equal the square root of two minus the square root of one you might notice that these rules for radicals the ones that hold and the ones that don't hold remind you of rules for exponents and that's no coincidence because radicals can be written in terms of exponents for example if we look at the first rule we could rewrite this the nth root of a times b is the same thing as the one over nth power and by exponent rules i can distribute an exponent across multiplication and so this radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule similarly the second rule can be restated in terms of exponents as a over b to the one over n is equal to a to the one over n divided by b to the one over n we can use the relationship between radicals and exponents to rewrite a to the m over n a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m with the nth root taken it's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the nth power to see why that's true think about exponent rules so a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m taken to the one over nth power that's because when we take a power to a power we multiply exponents and m times one over n is equal to m over n but a one over nth power is the same thing as an nth root and therefore this expression is the same thing as this expression and that proves the first equivalence the second equivalence can be proved similarly by writing a to the m over n as a to the 1 over n times m again this is works because when i take the power to the power i multiply exponents 1 over n times m is the same thing as m over n but now these two expressions are the same because the one over nth power is the same as the nth root one mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root so flower is like power and root is like root so that tells us we can write a fractional exponent the m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders now let's use these rules and some examples if we want to compute 25 to the negative threehalves power well first i'll use my exponent rule to rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over 25 to the 3 half's power next i'll use the power over root mnemonic to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square rooted or as 25 square rooted to the third power i wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis but most of the time people will omit this and just write the square root without a little number there now i could use either of these two equivalent expressions to continue but i'd rather use this one because it's easier to compute without a calculator the square root of 25 is just 5. five cubed is a hundred twentyfive so my answer is one over a hundred twentyfive if i tried to compute the cube of twentyfive first i'd get a huge number in general it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working without a calculator now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with with exponents in it i'm going to take the square root of all this stuff and since i don't really like negative exponents i'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the sixth over z to the 11th so i'll i'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent by moving this this factor to the denominator now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression that generally means to pull as much as possible out of the radical sign to pull things out of the square root sign i'm going to factor my numbers and try to rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible since the square root of a square those two operations undo each other so i'll show you what i mean first i'll factor 60 so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3 times 5 and i'll just copy everything over for now now i'll break things up into squares as much as possible so i've got a 2 squared times 3 times 5. i've already got an x squared i'll write the y to the 6 as y squared times y squared times y squared and i'll write the z to the 11th as z squared times z squared i guess 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 times 1 extra z that should add up to z to the 11th if i add all those exponents together now i know that i can distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division so i'll write this with a zillion different radicals here and every time i see the square root of something squared i can just cancel those square roots and the squares out and get what's what's left here so so after doing that cancellation i get 2 times the square root of 3 times 5 times x times y times y times y over z times itself i guess 5 times times the square root of z and now i can clean that up with exponents i'll write that as the square root of 15 i guess 2 times the square root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth the square root of z i'm going to leave this example as is but sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical expressions without radical signs in the denominator that's called rationalizing the denominator i won't do it here but i'll show you how to do it in the next example this example asks us to rationalize the denominator that means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator to get rid of the radical sign in the denominator i want to multiply my denominator by square root of x but i can't just multiply the denominator willynilly by something unless i multiply the numerator by the same thing so that i'm just multiplying my expression by 1 in a fancy form and i don't change the value of my expression now if i just multiply together numerators 3x squared of x and multiply denominators square root of x times square root of x is the square root of x squared square root of x squared is just x now i can cancel my x's from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is 3 times the square root of x i rationalized my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression in this video we went over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions by working with fractional exponents pulling things out of the radical sign and rationalizing the denominator hi class happy snow day since class is cancelled i'm putting together this video with some additional examples on simplifying radicals that i would have done in class i hope this will help you complete your assignment that's due tonight let's start with this example asking us to simplify the product of two radicals i could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things together but i think it'll save me trouble if i multiply first and then simplify so i'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical of the product assuming everything's positive i can rewrite my expression as the square root of let's see 5 times 15 that's going to be 75 x times x cubed that's x to the fourth because when i multiply two expressions i add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed that's going to be y to the tenth since 7 plus 3 is 10. now i want to simplify by pulling as much out of the square root sign as i can if 75 were a perfect square i could just take the square root of it but since it's not i'm going to factor it so 75 let's see that's 25 times 3 and 25 is 5 times 5 so i can write that as 5 squared times 3. now i can write my square root let's see so that's 5 squared times 3 times x to the 4th times y to the 10th now since i know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing assuming variables are positive uh i can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up into a bunch of squares so let's see i already have a square here there's no hope for the 3. the x to the 4th i can write that as x squared times x squared right that makes four x's and y to the tenth i'm going to need five y squareds to get 10 y's out of that one two three y squared y squared now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of square roots every time i see the square root of something squared i just replace it with the thing so that's five i still have the square root of three that gives me x x y y y y y and i can rewrite that as 5 square root of 3 times x squared y to the 5th so that's one way to simplify this expression alternatively i could complete this problem a little bit faster the following way i could go ahead and break up my 5 squared times 3 times x to the fourth times y to the 10th i'm going to break that up go ahead and break that out as a product of square roots now the square root of 5 squared is certainly 5 square root of 3 stays the same square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared there are a couple ways to see that one way is the square root of x fourth that's x to the fourth to the one half power since square roots are the same as half powers and now i can multiply my exponents to get my x squared or alternatively i can think of that because the square root of x to the fourth that's the square root of x squared squared since i take a power to a power i multiply my exponents square root of something squared is just the thing so that's x squared similarly the square root of y to the tenth that's going to be y to the fifth notice i'm just taking half of the exponent and you can see that the same way that's because if i do the square root of y to the tenth that's the same thing as y to the tenth to the onehalf which is y to the 10 times onehalf or y to the fifth or alternatively you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the square root of y to the fifth squared which is y to the fifth so if it weren't for all that little side work i did that would have this would have been a faster way to get to the same answer as before the next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators please pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions represent the same thing or different things in fact they represent the same thing and we can see that that we can transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing the denominator trying to get all the square roots out of the denominator at the expense of maybe putting some more squares in the numerator so to rationalize the denominator in this case since there's just that one that one piece with square roots in it i'm going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root of y the thing that has the square root around it if i multiply the bottom by the square root of y i have to multiply the top also so i won't change the value of my expression this way i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form now when i multiply fractions i multiply the numerator and i multiply the denominator well let's see the square root of y times the square root of y that's the square root of y squared which is the same thing as just y so i can bring my square roots together and get 3 square root of xy over 5y which is exactly the second expression here are two even crazier expressions the last one is especially crazy again try to decide if these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing kind of surprisingly they actually represent the same thing still and we can transform one to two by again rationalizing the denominator this time we're going to use something called the conjugate and that's because we have a difference in this case of two expressions one of which has a square root in it so when i have the difference of two expressions one of which with a square root in it i find the conjugate by taking the sum of those two expressions if instead i had had the sum of two expressions then the conjugate would be the difference okay so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by this conjugate of of the denominator so let me move down here and rewrite with more space once again i have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that i'm not changing the value of my expression i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form now let's look at what happens in the denominator first i have to multiply 3 by 3 3 by the square root of a negative square root of a by 3 and negative square root of a by square root of a so that's going to give me 3 times 3 is 9 plus 3 squared of a minus 3 squared of a minus square root of a squared so in a moment that i'll simplify to these things cancel so that'll be 9 minus square root of a squared is a notice how i've gotten rid of the square roots of the denominator which is why it's called rationalizing the denominator we get rid of the the i don't know the irrational numbers um the radical signs okay let's look at the numerator so again we have to we're going to have four terms this times this this times that b times 3 b times square root of a that gives us 15 a plus 5 a squared of a plus 3b plus b squared of a now that's starting to look similar to this expression here and in fact it we can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents so let's see we still have the 15a uh this is the same thing as 5a times a to the onehalf we've still got the 3b and we've got b times a to the onehalf and now let's see a times a to the onehalf here that's really i can add my exponents so that's going to be 5 a to the 1 plus onehalf is threehalves three b b a to the onehalf and that's exactly what i have in this expression just in a slightly different order so these really are the same kind of weird please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing the denominator of this expression since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator so that's square root of a minus 1. now when i multiply out the numerator we'll get four terms square root of a squared let's see minus the square root of a and now we have 7 times the square root of a and finally 7 times minus 1 that's minus 7. on the denominator we get the square root of a squared minus the square root of a plus the square root of a minus 1. notice how the square root things cancel just like before that's the whole magic of using the conjugate it makes those square roots cancel out so now on the numerator square root of a squared is a minus the square root of a plus seven squared of a that's a net of six squared of a's minus seven and then on the denominator we have a minus 1. we've gotten rid of the square roots on the denominator rationalize the denominator i'm happy leaving the square root in the numerator but if you want to you can change it to an exponent instead it's really up to you that's all the examples i have today i hope you enjoy the snow which hasn't started yet for me and um please do spend some time to finish your alex objective if you haven't done it already goodbye this video goes over some common methods of factoring recall that factoring an expression means to write it as a product so we could factor the number 30 by writing it as 6 times 5 or we could factor it more completely by writing it as 2 times three times five as another example we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six by writing it as x plus two times x plus 3. in this video i'll go over how i get from here to here how i know how to do the factoring but for right now i just want to review how i can go backwards how i can check that the factoring is correct and that's just by multiplying out or distributing if i distribute x plus 2 times x plus 3 then i multiply x by x that gives me x squared x times 3 gives me 3x 2 times x gives me 2x and 2 times 3 gives me 6. so that simplifies to x squared plus 5x plus 6 which checks out with what i started with so you can think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out and you can always check your factoring by distributing or multiplying out a bit of terminology when i think of an expression as a sum of a bunch of things then the things i sum up are called the terms but if i think of the same expression as a product of things then the things that i multiply together are called factors now let's get started on techniques of factoring when i have to factor something i always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor the greatest common factor means the largest thing that divides each of the terms in this first example the largest thing that divides both 15 and 25x is 5. so the gcf is 5. so i pull the 5 out and then i divide each of the terms by that number and so i get 3 plus 5x pause the video for a moment and see if you can find the greatest common factor of x squared y and y squared x cubed the biggest thing that divides both x squared y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared times y one way to find this is to look for the power of x that's smallest in each of these terms so that's x squared and the power of y that's smallest in each of these terms is just y to the 1 or y now if i factor out the x squared y from each of the terms that's like dividing each term by x squared y if i divide the first term by x squared y i just get 1. if i divide the second term by x squared y i'm going to be left with an x and a y i'll write this out on the side just to make it more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y that's like two y's on the and three x's on the top and two x's and a y on the bottom so i'm left with just an x and a y so i'll write the x y here and i factored my expression as always i can check my answer by multiplying out so if i multiply out my factored expression i get x squared y as the first term and the second term i get x they're now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's multiplied together and that checks out with what i started with the next technique of factoring i'd like to go over is factoring by grouping in this example notice that we have four terms factoring by grouping is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression you need to factor in order to factor by grouping i'm first going to factor out the greatest common factor of the first two terms and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last two terms the greatest common factor of x cubed and 3x squared is x squared so i factor out the x squared and i get x plus 3 and now the greatest common factor of 4x and 12 is just 4 so i factor out the 4 from those two terms notice that the factor of x plus 3 now appears in both pieces so i can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus 3 i think i'll factor it out on the left side instead of the right and now i have an x squared from this first piece and i have a 4 from this second piece and that completes my factoring by grouping you might wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus 4. but in fact as we'll see later this expression which is a sum of two squares x squared plus two squared does not factor any further over the integers next we'll do some factoring of quadratics a quadratic is an expression with a squared term just a term with x in it and a constant term with no x's in it i'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus some number times x plus or minus some other number the key idea is that if i can find those two numbers then if i were to distribute out this expression those two numbers would have to multiply to give me my constant term of 8 and these two numbers would end up having to add to give me my negative 6 because when i multiply out this number will be a coefficient of x and this number will be also another coefficient of x they'll add together to the negative 6. so if i look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me 8 so that could be one and eight two and four four and two but that's really the same things i had before and that's sort of the same thing i had before i i shouldn't forget the negatives i could have negative one negative eight or i could have negative 2 negative 4 those also multiply together to give me 8. now i just have to find see if there's a a pair of these numbers that add to negative 6 and it's not hard to see that these ones will work so now i can write out my factoring as that would be x minus 2 times x minus 4. and it's always a good idea to check by multiplying out i'm going to get x squared minus 4x minus 2x plus 8 and that works out to just what i want now this second example's a bit more complicated because now my leading coefficient my coefficient of x squared is not just one it's it's the number 10. now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this and i'm just going to show you one method my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping but but to start out i'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term so i'm multiplying 10 by negative 6. that gives me negative 60. and i'll also take my coefficient of x the number 11 and write that down here now i'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative 60 and add to give me 11. you might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous problem it's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by 8 because the coefficient of x squared was just 1. so to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and add to 11 you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it but if not you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors pairs of factors that multiply to negative 60. so i can start with negative 1 and 60 negative 2 and 30 negative 3 and 20 and keep going like this until i have found factors that actually add together to give me the number 11 and and now that i look at it i've already found them 5 15 minus 4 gives me 11. so i don't have to continue with my chart of factors now once i've found those factors i write out my expression 10x squared but instead of writing 11x i write negative 4x plus 15x now i copy down the negative 6. notice that negative 4x plus 15x equals 11x that's how i chose those numbers and so this expression is evaluates is the same as as this expression i haven't changed my expression but i have turned it into something that i can apply factoring by grouping on look i've got four terms here and so if i factor out my greatest common factor of my first two terms that's let's see i think it's 2x so i factor out the 2x i get 5x minus 2 and then i factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative 6. that would be 3 and i get a 5x minus 2 again this is working beautifully so i have a 5x minus 2 in each part and so i put the 5x minus 2 on the right and i put what's left from these terms in here so that's 2x plus 3 and i have factored my expression there are a couple special kinds of expressions that appear frequently that it's handy to just memorize the formula for so the first one is the difference of squares if you see something of the form a squared minus b squared then you can factor that as a plus b times a minus b and let's just check that that works if i do a plus b times a minus b and multiply that out i get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared and those middle two terms cancel out so it gives me back the difference of squares just like i want it so for this first example i if i think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared then i can see that's a difference of squares and i can immediately write it as x plus 4 times x minus 4. and the second example 9p squared minus 1 that's the same thing as 3p squared minus 1 squared so that's 3p plus 1 times 3p minus 1. notice that if i have a sum of squares for example x squared plus 4 which is x squared plus 2 squared then that does not factor the difference of squares formula doesn't apply and there is no formula that applies for a sum of squares there is however a formula for both a difference of cubes and a sum of cubes the difference of cubes formula a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared the formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same you just switch the negative and positive sign here and here so that gives us a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared as usual you can check these formulas by multiplying out let's look at one example of using these formulas y cubed plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes because it's y cubed plus three cubed so i can factor it using the sum of cubes formula by plugging in y for a and three for b that gives me y plus 3 times y squared minus y times 3 plus 3 squared and i can clean that up a little bit to read y plus 3 times y squared minus 3y plus 9. so in this video we went over several methods of factoring we did factoring out the greatest common factor we did factoring by grouping we did factoring quadratics and we did a difference of squares and we did a difference and a sum of cubes in more complicated problems you may need to apply several of these techniques in order to get through a single problem for example you might need to start by pulling out a greatest common factor and then do a factoring of quadratics or something similar now go forth and factor this video gives some additional examples of factoring please pause the video and decide which of these first five expressions factor and which one does not the first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term so that becomes x times x plus one the second example can be factored as a difference of two squares since x squared minus 25 is something squared minus something else squared and we know that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared that's a plus b times a minus b so we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five the third one is a sum of two squares there's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers so this is the one that does not factor just for completeness let's look at the next two this next one does factor by grouping when we factor by grouping we pull a the biggest common factor out of the first two terms that would be an x squared that becomes x squared times x plus two and then we factor as much as we can out of the next two terms that would be a 3 times x plus 2. notice that the x plus 2 factor now occurs in both of the resulting terms so we can pull that x plus 2 out and get x plus 2 times x squared plus 3. we can't factor any further because x squared plus 3 doesn't factor finally we have a quadratic this also factors and i like to factor these also using a factoring by grouping trick so first what i do is i multiply the coefficient of x squared and the constant term 5 times 8 is 40. i'll write that on the top of my x now i take the coefficient of the x term that's negative 14 and i write that on the bottom part of the x now i'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. sometimes i can just guess numbers like this but if not i start writing out factors of 40. so factors of 40 i could do 1 times 40. well now i just noticed i'm trying to add to a negative number so if i use two positive factors there's no way this is going to add to a negative number it's better for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. a negative times a negative still multiplies to 40 but they have a chance of adding to a negative number so but negative 1 and negative 40 of course don't work they don't add to negative 14 they add to negative 41. so let me try some other factors the next biggest number that divides 40 besides 1 is 2 so i'll try negative 2 and negative 20. those add to negative 22. that doesn't work next one that divides 40 would be 4 so i'll try negative 4 and negative 10. we have a winner so negative 4 plus negative 10 is negative 14 negative 4 times negative 10 is positive 40. we've got it all right so the next step is to use factoring by grouping we're going to first split up this negative 14x as negative 4x minus 10x and carry down the 8 and the 5x squared notice that this works because i picked negative 4 and negative 10 to add up to negative 14. so so negative 4x minus 10x will add up to negative 14x so i've got the same expression just just expand it out a little bit now i have four terms i can do factoring by grouping so i can group the first two terms and factor out the biggest thing i can that would be an x times five x minus four and now i'll factor the biggest thing i can out of these two numbers including the the negative so that becomes let's see i can factor out a negative 2 and that becomes 5 x minus 4 since negative 2 times minus 4 is 8. all right i've got the same 5x plus 4 in both my terms so factoring by grouping is going swimmingly i can factor out the 5x minus 4 from both those terms and i get the x minus 2. and i've factored this quadratic if i want to of course i can always check my work by distributing out by multiplying out so a check here would be multiplying 5x times x is 5x squared 5x minus times minus 2 is minus 10x minus 4 times x is minus 4x and minus 4 times 2 is plus 8. so let's see this does check out to exactly what it should be so that was the method of factoring a quadratic and all of these factor except for the sum of squares so we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring this expression here it was also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up the middle term into two terms so how can you tell when a an expression is is appropriate to factor by grouping there's a there's an easy way to to tell that it might be a candidate and that's that it has four terms so if you see four terms or in the case of quadratic you can split it up into four terms then that's a good candidate for factoring by grouping because you can group the first two terms group the second two terms factoring by grouping all won't always work on on expressions with four terms but but that's like the first thing to look for so let's just review what are the same main techniques of factoring we saw these on the previous page we saw there was pull out common factors there's difference of squares there's factoring by grouping there's factoring quadratics and one more that i didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes that uses the formulas a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared and a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared one important tip when factoring i always recommend doing this first pull out the common factors first that'll simplify things in making the rest of factoring easier one more tip is that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem for example you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares and then you might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to apply a difference of squares again so don't stop when you factor a little bit keep factoring as far as you can go here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice please pause the video and give these a try for the first one let's multiply 2 times negative 14 that gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the 3 down in the bottom of the x now we're looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to 3. well to multiply two numbers to get a negative 28 we'll need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive so let's see 1 negative 1 28 or 1 negative 28 those don't work let's see negative 2 14 or 2 negative 14. those don't work hey i just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the negative number so that they add to a positive number let's see what comes next how about negative 4 times 7 4 times negative 7 i think 4 negative 4 times 7 will work so i'll write those here negative 4 7. i'll copy down the 2 z squared and i'll split up the 3z into negative 4z plus 7z and then minus 14. now factoring by grouping pull out a 2z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a 7 and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good i've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored expression my second expression i could work it the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if i notice first that i can pull out a common factor from all of my terms that'll make things a lot simpler to deal with so notice that a 5 divides each of these terms in fact i'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because i don't like having negatives in front of my squared terms so i'm going to pull out a common factor of negative 5. again it would work if i forgot to do this but it would be a lot more complicated so negative 5 v squared this becomes minus now this becomes plus 9v since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times negative 5 is positive 50. now i can start my x and my factoring by grouping or i can use kind of a shortcut method which you may have seen before so i can just put v's here and then i know that whatever numbers go here they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're gonna have to add to the nine so that would be a plus 10 and a minus one will do the trick those are all my factoring examples for today i hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a chance to spend some time working in alex bye this video is about working with rational expressions a rational expression is a fraction usually with variables in it something like x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression in this video we'll practice adding subtracting multiplying and dividing rational expressions and simplifying them to lowest terms we'll start with simplifying to lowest terms recall that if you have a fraction with just numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and factoring the denominator and then canceling common factors so in this example the threes can't solve and our fraction reduces to 7 over 15. if we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms we proceed the same way first we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2 and then factor the denominator in this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2 we could also write that as x plus 2 squared now we cancel the common factors and we're left with 3 over x plus 2. definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression next let's practice multiplying and dividing recall that if we multiply two fractions with just numbers in them we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators so in this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or 8 15. if we want to divide two fractions like in the second example then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction on the denominator so here we get fourfifths times threehalves and that gives us twelve tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to sixfifths we use the same rules when we compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with variables in them here we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead we can multiply by the reciprocal i call this flipping and multiplying and now we just multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators it might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely that way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors so let's factor it even more the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus one and x squared minus 16 that's a difference of two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. the denominator is already fully factored so we'll just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here and we're left with x times x minus 4. this is our final answer adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated because we first have to find a common denominator a common denominator is an expression that both denominators divide into it's usually best in the long run to use the least common denominator which is the smallest expression that both denominators divide into in this example if we just want a common denominator we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15 divide evenly into 90. but if we want the least common denominator the best way to do that is to factor the two denominators so 6 is 2 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our number so if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30 we know that 2 times 3 will divide it and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get a denominator any smaller because we need the factors 2 3 and 5 in order to ensure both these numbers divide it once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our fractions in terms of that denominator so 7 6 i need to get a 30 in the denominator so i'm going to multiply that by 5 over 5. i multiply by the factors that are missing from the current denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. for the second fraction 4 15 15 times 2 is 30 so i'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. now i can rewrite this as 35 30 minus 8 30 and now that i have a common denominator i can just subtract my two numerators and i get 27 thirtieths if i factor i can reduce this to three squared over two times five which is nine tenths the process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them follows the exact same process first we have to find the least common denominator i'll do that by factoring the two denominators so 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1 x squared minus 1 that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. now for the least common denominator i'm going to take all the factors i need to get an expression that each of these divides into so i need the factor 2 i need the factor x plus 1 and i need the factor x minus 1. i don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1. i just need to have it one time and so i will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. i'm not going to bother multiplying this out it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify later now i can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator so what i mean is i can rewrite 3 over 2x plus 2. i'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1 i'll write it in factored form and then i notice that compared to the least common denominator i'm missing the factor of x minus 1. so i multiply the numerator and the denominator by x minus 1. i just need it in the denominator but i can't get away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression i have to multiply by it on the numerator and the denominator so i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not changing the value here so now i do the same thing for the second rational expression i'll i'll write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator what's missing in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2. so i'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. now i can rewrite everything so the first rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. notice that i now have a common denominator so i can just add together my numerators so i get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. i'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the denominator in factored form but i do have to multiply out the numerator so that i can add things together so i get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that i can cancel out so this is already reduced as much as it can be this is my final answer in this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and canceling common factors we also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the numerator and multiplying the denominator how to divide rational expressions by flipping and multiplying and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least common denominator this video is about solving quadratic equations a quadratic equation is an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no higher powers of x the standard form for our quadratic equation is the form a x squared plus b x plus c equals 0 where a b and c represent real numbers and a is not zero so that we actually have an x squared term let me give you an example three x squared plus seven x minus two equals 0 is a quadratic equation in standard form here a is 3 b is 7 and c is minus 2. the equation 3x squared equals minus 7x plus 2 is also a quadratic equation it's just not in standard form the key steps to solving quadratic equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either factor it or use the quadratic formula which i'll show you later in this video let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y here our variable is y and we need to rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form we can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides and adding 7y to both sides that gives us the equation y squared minus eighteen plus seven y equals zero and i can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus seven y minus eighteen equals zero now i've got my equation in standard form next i'm going to try to factor it so i need to look for two numbers that multiply to negative 18 and add to seven two numbers that work are nine and negative two so i can factor my expression on the left as y plus nine times y minus two equals zero now anytime you have two quantities that multiply together to give you zero either the first quantity has to be zero or the second quantity has to be zero or i suppose they both could be zero in some situations this is really handy because that means that i know that either y plus nine equals zero or y minus two equals zero so i can as my next step set my factors equal to 0. so y plus 9 equals 0 or y minus 2 equals 0 which means that y equals negative 9 or y equals 2. it's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by plugging them into the original equation negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative 9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2. in the next example let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. this is a quadratic equation because it's got a square of my variable w i can rewrite it in standard form by subtracting 121 from both sides notice that a is equal to 1 b is equal to zero because there's no w term and c is equal to negative 121 in the standard form a w squared plus b w plus c equals zero next step i'm going to try to factor this expression so since 121 is 11 squared this is a difference of two squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to zero if i set the factors equal to zero i get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11 equals zero so w equals minus 11 or w equals 11. in this example i could have solved the equation more simply i could have instead said that if w squared is 121 then w has to equal plus or minus the square root of 121 in other words w is plus or minus 11. if you solve the equation this way it's important to remember the plus or minus since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does now let's find the solutions for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. some people might be tempted to say that oh if two numbers multiply to equal seven then one of them better equal one and the other equals seven or maybe negative 1 and negative 7 but that's faulty reasoning in this case because x and x plus 2 don't have to be whole numbers they could be crazy fractions or even irrational numbers so instead let's rewrite this equation in standard form to do that i'm first going to multiply out so x times x is x squared x times 2 is 2x that equals 7 and i'll subtract the 7 from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus 7 is 0. now i'm looking to factor it so i need two numbers that multiply to negative 7 and add to 2. since the only way to factor negative 7 is as negative 1 times 7 or 7 times negative 1 it's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will will work so there's no way to factor this expression over the integers instead let's use the quadratic equation so we have our leading coefficient of x squared is one so a is one b is two and c is minus seven and we're going to plug that into the equation quadratic equation which goes x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a different people have different ways of remembering this formula i'd like to remember it by singing it x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a but you can use any mnemonic you like anyway plugging in here we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1 times negative 7. it's important to remember the negative 7 there all over 2 times 1. now 2 squared is 4 and 4 times 1 times negative 7 is negative 28 so this whole quantity under the square root sign becomes 4 minus negative 28 or 32. so i can rewrite this as x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 32 all over 2. since 32 is 16 times 2 and 16 is a perfect square i can rewrite this as negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of 2 over 2 which is negative 2 plus or minus 4 times the square root of 2 over 2. next i'm going to split up my fraction as negative 2 over 2 plus or minus 4 square root of 2 over 2 and then simplify those fractions this becomes negative 1 plus or minus 2 square root of 2. so my answers are negative 1 plus 2 square root of 2 and negative 1 minus 2 square root of 2. and if i need a decimal answer for any reason i could work those out on my calculator as our final example let's find all real solutions for the equation one half y squared equals one third y minus two i'll start as usual by putting it in standard form so that gives me one half y squared minus one third y plus two equals zero i could go ahead and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now but i find fractional coefficients kind of annoying so i'd like to get rid of them by doing what i call clearing the denominator that means i'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common denominator in this case the least common denominator is 2 times 3 or 6. so i'll multiply the whole equation by 6. i have to make sure i multiplied both sides of the equation but in this case 6 times 0 is just 0. and when i distribute the 6 i get 3y squared minus 2y plus 12 equals 0. now i could try to factor this but i think it's easier probably just to plunge in and use the quadratic formula so i get x equals negative b that's negative negative 2 or 2 plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c all over 2 a working out the stuff on the square root sign negative 2 squared is 4 and here we have let's see 144 so this simplifies to x equals 2 plus or minus the square root of 4 minus 144 that's negative 140 all over six well if you're concerned about the negative number under the square root sign you should be we can't take the square root of a negative number and get an and get a real number as our answer there's no real number whose square is a negative number and therefore our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic equation in this video we solved some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula in some examples factoring doesn't work it's not possible to factor the equation but in fact using the quadratic formula will always work even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring so you can't really lose by using the quadratic formula it's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead this video is about solving equations with absolute values in them recall that the absolute value of a positive number is just the number but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite in general i think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from 0 on the number line the number 4 and the number negative 4 are both at distance 4 from 0 and so the absolute value of both of them is 4. similarly if i write the equation the absolute value of x is 3 that means that x has to be 3 units away from zero on the number line and so x would have to be either negative three or three let's start with the equation three times the absolute value of x plus two equals four i'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the equation i can do this by starting with my original equation subtracting 2 from both sides and dividing both sides by 3. now i'll think in terms of distance on a number line the absolute value of x is twothirds means that x is twothirds away from zero so x could be here or here at negative twothirds or at twothirds and the answer to my equation is x is negative twothirds or twothirds i can check my answers by plugging in three times the absolute value of negative twothirds plus two i need to check if that equals four well the absolute value of negative twothirds is just twothirds so this is three times twothirds plus two which works out to four similarly if i plug in positive twothirds it also works out to give me a correct answer this second example is a little different because the absolute value sign is around a more complicated expression not just around the x i would start by isolating the absolute value part but it's already isolated so i'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance on the number line so on my number line the whole expression 3x plus 2 is supposed to be at a distance of 4 from 0. so that means that three x plus two is here at four or three x plus two is at negative four i'll write those as equations three x plus 2 equals 4 or 3x plus 2 is minus 4 and then i can solve so this becomes 3x equals 2 or x equals 2 thirds and over here i get 3x equals minus 6 or x equals minus 2. finally i'll check my answers i'll leave it to you to verify that they both work a common mistake on absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs like we did here and then just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers another mistake sometimes people make is once they get the first answer they just assume that the negative of that works also but that doesn't always work in the first example our two answers were both the negatives of each other but in our second examples our two answers were not just the opposites of each other one was twothirds and the other was negative two in this third example let's again isolate the absolute value part of the equation so starting with our original equation we can subtract 16 from both sides and divide both sides by five or equivalently multiply by onefifth now let's think about distance on the number line we have an absolute value needs to equal negative 3. so that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign needs to be at distance negative three from zero well you can't be at distance negative three from zero another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end up with a negative number absolute value is always positive or zero so this equation doesn't actually make sense and there are no solutions to this equation in this video we solved absolute value equations in many cases an absolute value equation will have two solutions but in some cases it'll have no solutions and occasionally it'll have just one solution this video is about solving rational equations a rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions in it in other words an equation that has some variables in the denominator there are several different approaches for solving a rational equation but they all start by finding the least common denominator in this example the denominators are x plus 3 and x we can think of 1 as just having a denominator of 1. since the denominators don't have any factors in common i can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together my next step is going to be clearing the denominator by this i mean that i multiply both sides of my equation by this least common denominator x plus 3 times x so i multiply it on the left side of the equation and i multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation since i'm doing the same thing to both sides of the equation i don't change the the value of the equation multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to multiplying it by all three terms in the equation i can see this when i multiply out i'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much and then i'll distribute the right side to get x plus 3 times x times 1 plus x plus 3 times x times 1 over x so i've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation now i can have a blast cancelling things the x plus 3 cancels with the x plus 3 on the denominator the here nothing cancels out because there's no denominator and here the x in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator so i can rewrite my expression as x squared equals x plus 3 times x times 1 plus x plus 3. now i'm going to simplify so i'll leave the x squared alone on this side i'll distribute out x squared plus 3x plus x plus 3. hey look the x squares cancel on both sides and so i get 0 equals 4x plus 3 so 4x is negative 3 and x is negative 3 4. finally i'm going to plug in my answer to check this is a good idea for any kind of equation but it's especially important for a rational equation because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous solutions solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the denominator zero now in this example i don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations because negative 3 4 is not going to make any of these denominators 0. so it should work out fine when i plug in if i plug in i get this i can simplify the denominator here negative 3 4 plus 3. 3 is 12 4. so that becomes 9 4. and this is 1 i'll flip and multiply to get minus 4 thirds so here i can simplify my complex fraction it ends up being negative three ninths and one minus four thirds is negative one third so that all seems to check out and so my final answer is x equals negative threefourths this next example looks a little trickier and it is but the same approach will work first i'll find the least common denominator so here my denominators are c minus five c plus one and c squared minus four c minus five i'm gonna factor that as c minus five times c plus 1. now my least common denominator needs to have just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it so i need the factor c minus 5 i need the factor c plus 1 and now i've already got all the factors i need for this denominator so here is my least common denominator next step is to clear the denominators so i do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator in fact i can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator i went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what cancels now canceling time not dies this dies and both of those factors die canceling out the denominator is the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator you're multiplying by something that's big enough to kill every single denominator so you don't have to deal with denominators anymore now i'm going to simplify by multiplying out so i get let's see c plus 1 times 4c that's 4c squared plus 4c now i get minus just c minus 5. and then over here i get 3c squared plus 3. i can rewrite the minus quantity c minus 5 as minus c plus 5. and now i can subtract the 3c squared from both sides to get just a c squared over here and the 4c minus c that becomes a 3c and finally i can subtract the 3 from both sides to get c squared plus 3c plus 2 equals 0. i've got myself a quadratic equation that looks like a nice one that factors so this factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero so either c plus one is zero or c plus two is zero so c equals negative one or c equals negative two now let's see we need to still check our answers without even going to the trouble of calculating anything i can see that c equals negative 1 is not going to work because if i plug it in to this denominator here i get a denominator of zero which doesn't make sense so c equals minus one is an extraneous solution it doesn't actually satisfy my original equation and so i can just cross it right out c equals negative 2 i can go if i go ahead that doesn't make any of my denominators zero so if i haven't made any mistakes it should satisfy my original equation but but i'll just plug it in to be sure and after some simplifying i get a true statement so my final answer is c equals negative 2. in this video we solved a couple of rational equations using the method of finding the least common denominator and then clearing the denominator we cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator or equivalently multiplying each of the terms by that denominator there's another equivalent method that some people prefer it still starts out the same we find the least common denominator but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator so in this example we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus 3 times x but our next step would be to write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and the bottom by the appropriate things so 1 in order to get the common denominator of x plus 3 x i need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus 3 times x 1 over x i need to multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus 3 since that's what's missing from the denominator x now if i simplify a little bit uh let's see this is x squared over that common denominator and here i have just x plus 3 times x over that denominator and here i have x plus 3 over that common denominator now i'll add together my fractions on the right side so they have a common denominator so this is x plus 3 times x plus x plus 3. and now i have two fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator therefore their numerators have to be equal also so the next step is to set the numerators equal so i get x squared is x plus 3 times x plus x plus three and if you look back at the previous way we solve this equation you'll recognize this equation and so from here on we just continue as before when choosing between these two methods i personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators method because it's a little bit less writing you don't have to you get rid of those denominators earlier you don't have to write them as many times but some people find this one a little bit easier to remember a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine one last caution don't forget at the end to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous solutions these will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equations go to zero this video is about solving radical equations that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them or cube roots or any other kind of radical when i see an equation with a square root in it i really want to get rid of the square root but it'll be easiest to get rid of the square root if i first isolate the square root in other words i want to get the term with the square root in it on one side of the equation by itself and everything else on the other side of the equation if i start with my original equation x plus the square root of x equals 12 and i subtract x from both sides then that does isolate the square root term on the left side with everything else on the right once i've isolated the term with the square root i'm going to get rid of the square root and i'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation so i'll take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides now the square root of x squared is just x taking the square root and then squaring those operations undo each other to work out 12 minus x squared i'll write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144 12 times minus x is minus 12x i get another minus 12x from here and finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared so i can combine my minus 12 x's that's minus 24x and now i can subtract x from both sides to get 0 equals 144 minus 25x plus x squared that's a quadratic equation i'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard form here so now i've got a familiar quadratic equation with no radical signs left in my equation i'll just proceed to solve it like i usually do for a quadratic i'll try to factor it so i'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. well i know i'm going to need negative numbers to get to negative 25 and in fact i'll need two negative numbers so they still multiply to a positive number so i'll start listing some factors of 144. i could have negative 1 and a negative 144 negative 2 and negative 72 negative 4 negative 36 and so on once i've listed out the possible factors it's not hard to find the two that add to negative 25 so that's negative 9 and negative 16. so now i can factor my quadratic equation as x minus 9 times x minus 16 equals 0. that means that x minus 9 is 0 or x minus 16 is 0. so x equals 9 or x equals 16. i'm almost done but there's one last very important step and that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous solutions an extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy our original equation and extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with radicals in them so let's first check x equals 9 if we plug in to our original equation we get 9 plus the square root of 9 and we want that to equal 12. well the square root of 9 is 3 and 9 plus 3 it does indeed equal 12 so that solution checks out now let's try x equals 16 plugging in we get 16 plus the square root of 16 and that's supposed to equal 12. well that says 16 plus 4 is supposed to equal 12 but that most definitely is not true and so x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous solution and our only solution is x equals 9. this next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals but in fact we can think of a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise let's start by doing the same thing we did on the previous problem by isolating this time we'll isolate the part of the equation that involves the fractional exponent so i'll start with the original equation 2 times p to the 4 5 equals 1 oneeighth and i'll divide both sides by two or equivalently i can multiply both sides by onehalf that gives me p to the fourfifths equals onesixteenth and i've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the fractional exponent as much as possible now in the previous example the next step was to get rid of the radical in this example we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent and i'm going to actually do this in two stages first i'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power that's because when i take an exponent to an exponent i multiply my exponents and so that becomes just p to the fourth equals 1 16 to the fifth power now i'm going to get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the onefourth power or by taking the fourth root there's something that you need to be careful about though when taking an even root or the one over an even number power you always have to consider plus or minus your answer it's kind of like when you write x squared equals 4 and you take the square root of both sides x could equal plus or minus the square root of 4 right x could equal plus or minus 2 since minus 2 squared is 4 just as well as 2 squared so that's why when you take an even root or a 1 over an even power of both sides you always need to include the plus or minus sign when it's an odd root or one over an odd power you don't need to do that if you had something like x cubed equals negative 8 then x equals the cube root of negative 8 which is negative 2 would be your only solution you don't need to do the plus or minus because positive 2 wouldn't work so that aside explains why we need this plus or minus power and now p to the 4 to the 1 4 when i raise a power to a power i multiply by exponents so that's just p to the 1 which is equal to plus or minus 1 16 to the fifth power to the onefourth power now i just need to simplify this expression i don't really want to raise 1 16 to the fifth power because 16 to the fifth power is like a really huge number so i think i'm actually going to rewrite this first as p equals plus or minus 1 16. i'll write it back as the 5 4 power again and as i continue to solve using my exponent rules i'm going to prefer to write this as 1 16 to the 4th root to the 5th power because it's going to be easier to take the 4th root let's see the 4th root of 1 16 is the same thing as the 4th root of 1 over the fourth root of sixteen raise all that to the fifth power fourth root of one is just one and the fourth root of sixteen is two raise that to the fifth power that's just gonna be one to the fifth over two to the fifth which is plus or minus 1 32nd the last step is to check answers so i have the two answers p equals 132nd and p equals minus one thirty seconds and if i plug those both in one thirty second to the fourth fifth power that gives me two times one to the four fifth power over 32 to the fourfifth power which is two times one over thirtytwo fifth rooted to the fourth power fifth root of 32 is two raise that to the fourth power i get 16 so this is 2 times 1 16 which is 1 8 just as we wanted in the original equation up here similarly we can check that the p equals negative 1 32nd actually does satisfy the equation i'll leave that step to the viewer so our two solutions are p equals 1 over 32 and p equals minus 1 over 32. i do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent we could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation to the fivefourths power 5 4 is the reciprocal of fourfifths so when i use my exponent rules and say that when i raise the power to the power i multiply my exponents that gives me p to the fourfifths times fivefourths is plus or minus onesixteenth to the fivefourths in other words p to the one power which is just p is plus or minus onesixteenth to the fivefourths so that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution once again the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the 5 4 power we're really taking an even root a fourth root and so we need to consider both positive and negative answers this video is about solving radical equations that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them or cube roots or any other kind of radical in this video we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional exponent and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides this video is about solving inequalities that have absolute value signs in them let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is less than five on the number line thinking of absolute value as distance this means that the distance between x and zero is less than five units so x has to live somewhere in between negative five and five we can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative five is less than x which is less than five or we can use interval notation soft bracket negative 5 5 soft bracket both of these formulations are equivalent to the original one but don't involve the absolute value signs in the second example we're looking for the values of x for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five on the number line this means that the distance of x from the zero has got to be bigger than or equal to five units a distance bigger than five units means that x has to live somewhere over here or somewhere over here where it's farther than five units away from zero of course x could also have a distance equal to five units so i'll fill in that dot and shade in the other parts of the number line that satisfy my inequality now i can rewrite the inequality without the absolute value symbols by saying that x is less than or equal to negative 5 or x is greater than or equal to 5. i could also write this in interval notation soft bracket negative infinity negative five hard bracket and the second part is hard bracket five infinity soft bracket i combine these with a u for union because i'm trying to describe all these points on the number line together with all these other points let's take this analysis a step further with a slightly more complicated problem now i want the absolute value of 3 minus 2t to be less than 4. an absolute value less than 4 means a distance less than 4 on the number line but it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than 4 from 0 it's the whole expression 3 minus 2t so 3 minus 2t lives somewhere in here and i can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative 4 is less than 3 minus 2t is less than 4. now i have a compound inequality that i can solve the usual way first i'll subtract 3 from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative two t is less than one and now i'll divide all three sides by negative two since negative two is a negative number this reverses the directions of the inequalities simplifying i get 7 halves is greater than t is greater than negative onehalf so my final answer on the number line looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves but not including the end points and in interval notation i can write this soft bracket negative a half seven halves soft bracket please pause the video and try the next problem on your own thinking in terms of distance this inequality says that the distance between the expression 3 minus 2t and 0 is always bigger than 4. let me draw this on the number line if 3 minus 2t has a distance bigger than 4 from 0 then it can't be in this region that's near zero it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions that is 3 minus 2t is either less than negative 4 or 3 minus 2t is bigger than 4. i'll solve these two inequalities separately the first one subtracting 3 from both sides i get negative 2t is less than negative 7. dividing by negative 2 i get t is bigger than 7 halves and then on the other side i get negative 2t is greater than 1 so t is less than negative onehalf i had to flip inequalities in the last step due to dividing by a negative number so let's check this out on the number line again the first piece says that t is greater than seven halves i'll draw that over here and the second piece says that t is less than negative onehalf i'll draw that down here because these two statements are joined with an or i'm looking for the tvalues that are in this one or in this one that is i want both of these regions put together so in interval notation this reads negative infinity to negative one half soft bracket union soft bracket seven halves to infinity this last example looks more complicated but if i simplify first and isolate the absolute value part it looks pretty much like the previous ones so i'll start by subtracting 7 from both sides and then i'll divide both sides by 2. now i'll draw my number line and i'm looking for this expression 4x plus 5 to always have distance greater than or equal to negative 3 from 0. wait a second distance greater than or equal to negative three well distance is always greater than or equal to negative three it's always greater than or equal to zero so this in fact is always true and so the answer to my inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity in other words all real numbers when solving absolute value inequalities it's good to think about distance an absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever is inside the absolute value signs is close to zero on the other hand an absolute value of something being greater than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero because its distance from zero is bigger than a certain number drawing these pictures on the number line is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that doesn't contain an absolute value sign in this case it would be negative three is less than x plus two is less than three and the other case it would be either x plus two is less than negative three or x plus two is greater than three this video is about solving linear inequalities those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x but don't involve any x squared or other higher power terms the good news is we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd solve linear equations by distributing adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying and dividing by numbers on both sides the only thing that's different is that if you multiply or divide by a negative number then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality for example if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative 5 and we wanted to multiply both sides by negative 1 to get rid of the negative signs we'd have to also switch or reverse the inequality with this caution in mind let's look at our first example since our variable x is trapped in parentheses i'll distribute the negative five to free it from the parentheses that gives me negative five x minus ten plus three is greater than eight negative ten plus 3 is negative 7 so i'll rewrite this as negative 5 x minus 7 is greater than 8. now i'll add 7 to both sides to get negative 5x is greater than 15. now i'd like to divide both sides by negative 5 since negative 5 is a negative number that reverses the inequality so i get x is less than 15 divided by negative 5 in other words x is less than negative three if i wanted to graph this on a number line i just need to put down a negative three an open circle around it and shade in to the left i use an open circle because x is strictly less than negative 3 and can't equal negative 3. if i wanted to write this in interval notation i write it as soft bracket negative infinity negative 3 soft bracket again the soft bracket is because the negative 3 is not included this next example is an example of a compound inequality it has two parts either this statement is true or this statement is true i want to find the values of x that satisfy either one i'll solve this by working out each part separately and then combining them at the end for the inequality on the left i'll copy it over here i'm going to add 4 to both sides then subtract x from both sides and then divide both sides by 2. i didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because i divided by a positive number on the right side i'll copy the equation over subtract one from both sides and divide both sides by six nine sixths is the same as three halves now i'm looking for the x values that make this statement true or make this statement true let me graph this on a number line x is less than or equal to negative 2 means i put a filled in circle there and graph everything to the left x is greater than three halves means i put an empty circle here and shade in everything to the right my final answer includes both of these pieces which i'll reshade in green because x is allowed to be in either one or the other finally i can write this in interval notation the first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket negative infinity negative two hard bracket and the second piece can be described as soft bracket three halves infinity soft bracket to indicate that x can be in either one of these pieces i use the union sign which is a u that means that my answer includes all x values in here together with all x values in here this next example is also a compound inequality this time joined by an and the and means i'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this and this at the same time again i can solve each piece separately on the left to isolate the y i need to multiply by negative three halves on both sides so that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves the greater than flipped to a less than because i was multiplying by negative three halves which is a negative number if i clean up the right side i get y is less than 18. on the right side i'll start by subtracting 2 from both sides and now i'll divide by negative 4 again a negative number so that flips the inequality so that's y is less than 3 over negative 4. in other words y is less than negative 3 4. again i'm looking for the y values that make both of these statements true at the same time let me graph this on the number line the y is less than 18 i can graph that by drawing the number 18 i don't want to include it so i use an empty circle and i shaded everything to the left the statement y is less than negative threefourths i need to draw a negative 3 4 and again i don't include it but i do include everything on the left since i want the y values for which both of these statements are true i need the y values that are in both colored blue and colored red and so that would be this part right here i'll just draw it above so you can see it easily so that would be all the numbers from negative 3 4 and lower not including negative 3 4. since those are the parts the number line that have both red and blue colors on them in interval notation my final answer will be soft bracket negative infinity to negative threefourths soft bracket as my final example i have an inequality that has two inequality signs in it negative 3 is less than or equal to 6x minus 2 is less than 10. i can think of this as being a compound inequality with two parts negative three x is less than or equal to six x minus two and at the same time six x minus two is less than ten i could solve this in two pieces as before but instead it's a little more efficient to just solve it all at once by doing the same thing to all three sides so as a first step i'll add 2 to all three sides that gives me negative 1 is less than or equal to 6x is less than 12 and now i'm going to divide all three sides by 6 to isolate the x so that gives me negative 1 6 is less than or equal to x is less than 2. if we'd solved it instead in two pieces above we'd end up with the same thing because we'd get negative 1 6 is less than or equal to x from this piece and we'd get x is less than 2 on this piece and because of the and statement that's the same thing as saying negative 1 6 is less or equal to x which is less than 2. either way we do it let's see if what it looks like on the number line so on the number line we're looking for things that are between 2 and negative 1 6 including the negative 1 6 but not including the 2. in interval notation we can write this as hard bracket negative 1 6 to soft bracket in this video we solved linear inequalities including some compound inequalities joined by the conjunctions and and or remember when we're working with and we're looking for places on the number line where both statements are true that is we're looking for the overlap on the number line in this case the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue at the same time when we're working with or statements we're looking for places where either one or the other statement is true or both on the number line this corresponds to points that are colored either red or blue or both and in this picture that would actually correspond to the entire number line in this video we'll solve inequalities involving polynomials like this one and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one let's start with a simple example maybe a deceptively simple example if you see the inequality x squared is less than 4 you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and get something like x is less than 2 as your answer but in fact that doesn't work to see why it's not correct consider the x value of negative 10. negative 10 satisfies the inequality x is less than 2 since negative 10 is less than two but it doesn't satisfy the inequality x squared is less than four since negative ten squared is a hundred which is not less than four so these two inequalities are not the same and it doesn't work to solve a quadratic inequality just to take the square root of both sides you might be thinking part of why this reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the negative two option right if we had the equation x squared equals 4 then x equals 2 would just be one option x equals negative 2 would be another solution so somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account in fact a good way to solve an inequality involving x squareds or higher power terms is to solve the associated equation first but before we even do that i like to pull everything over to one side so that my inequality has zero on the other side so for our equation i'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than zero now i'm going to actually solve the associated equation x squared minus 4 is equal to 0. i can do this by factoring to x minus 2 times x plus 2 is equal to 0 and i'll set my factors equal to 0 and i get x equals 2 and x equals minus 2. now i'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line so i write down negative 2 and 2. those are the places where my expression x squared minus 4 is equal to 0. since i want to find where x squared minus 4 is less than 0 i want to know where this expression x squared minus 4 is positive or negative a good way to find that out is to plug in test values so first i'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line something less than negative 2 say x equals negative 3. if i plug in negative 3 into x squared minus 4 i get negative 3 squared minus 4 which is 9 minus 4 which is 5. that's a positive number so at negative 3 the expression x squared minus 4 is positive and in fact everywhere on this region of the number line my expression is going to be positive because it can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where it's zero i can figure out whether x squared minus 4 is positive or negative on this region and on this region of the number line by plugging in test values similarly a value to plug in between negative 2 and 2 a nice value is x equals 0. 0 squared minus 4 that's negative 4 a negative number so i know that my expression x squared minus 4 is negative on this whole interval finally i can plug in something like x equals 10 something bigger than 2 and i get 10 squared minus 4. without even computing that i can tell that that's going to be a positive number and that's all that's important again since i want x squared minus 4 to be less than 0 i'm looking for the places on this number line where i'm getting negatives so i'll shade that in on my number line it's in here not including the endpoints because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus 4 is equal to zero and i want it strictly less than zero i can write my answer as an inequality negative 2 is less than x is less than 2 or in interval notation as soft bracket negative 2 to soft bracket our next example we can solve similarly first we'll move everything to one side so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is greater than or equal to zero next we'll solve the associated equation by factoring so first i'll write down the equation now i'll factor out an x and now i'll factor the quadratic so the solutions to my equation are x equals 0 x equals 6 and x equals negative 1. i'll write the solutions to the equation on the number line so that's negative one zero and six that's where my expression x times x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero but i want to find where it's greater than or equal to 0 so again i can use test values i can plug in for example x equals negative 2 either to this version of the expression or to this factored version since i only care whether my answer is positive or negative it's sometimes easier to use the factored version for example when x is negative 2 this factor is negative but this factor x minus 6 is also negative when i plug in negative 2 for x finally x plus 1 when i plug in negative 2 for x that's negative 1 that's also negative and a negative times a negative times a negative gives me a negative number if i plug in something between negative 1 and 0 say x equals negative 1 half then i'm going to get a negative for this factor a negative for this factor but a positive for this third factor negative times negative times positive gives me a positive for a test value between 0 and 6 let's try x equals 1. now i'll get a positive for this factor a negative for this factor and a positive for this factor a positive times a negative times a positive gives me a negative finally for a test value bigger than six we could use say x equals a hundred that's going to give me positive positive positive so my product will be positive since i want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero i want the places where it equals zero and the places where it's positive so my final answer will be close bracket negative 1 to 0 close bracket union close bracket 6 to infinity as our final example let's consider the rational inequality x squared plus 6x plus 9 divided by x minus 1 is less than or equal to 0. although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus 1 it's dangerous to do that because x minus 1 could be a positive number but it could also be a negative number and when you multiply both sides by a negative number you have to reverse the inequality although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where x minus one is less than zero or bigger than zero i think it's much easier just to solve the same way as we did before so we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have 0 on the right well that's already true so the next step would be to solve the associated equation that is x squared plus 6x plus 9 over x minus 1 is equal to 0. that would be where the numerator is 0 x squared plus 6x plus 9 is equal to 0 so where x plus 3 squared is 0 or x equals negative 3. there's one extra step we have to do for rational expressions and that's we need to find where the expression does not exist that is let's find where the denominator is 0 and that's at x equals 1. i'll put all those numbers on the number line the places where my rational expression is equal to 0 and the place where my rational expression doesn't exist then i can start in with test values for example x equals minus 4 0 and 2 work if i plug those values into this expression here i get a negative answer a negative answer and a positive answer the reason i need to conclude the values on my number line where my denominator is 0 is because i can my expression can switch from negative to positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist as well as passing by passing through through a place where my rational expression is equal to zero now i'm looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero so that means i want the places on the number line where my expression is equal to 0 and also the places where it's negative so my final answer is x is less than 1 or in interval notation negative infinity to 1. in this video we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line and using test values to make a sign chart the distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points if we know their coordinates if this first point has coordinates x1 y1 and the second point has coordinates x2 y2 then the distance between them is given by the formula the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared this formula actually comes from the pythagorean theorem let me draw a right triangle with these two points as two of its vertices then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates similarly the length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates now the pythagorean theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled a and b and hypotenuse labeled c we have that a squared plus b squared equals c squared well if we apply that to this triangle here this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking for so pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length that is x2 minus x1 squared plus the square of this side length which is y2 minus y1 squared has to equal the square of the hypotenuse that is d squared taking the square root of both sides of this equation we get the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared is equal to d we don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the square root because distance is always positive so we've derived our distance formula now let's use it in an example let's find the distance between the two points negative one five so negative one five maybe over here and four 2. this notation just means that p is the point with coordinates negative 1 5 and q is the point with coordinates 4 2. we have the distance formula let's think of p being the point with coordinates x1 y1 and q being the point with coordinates x2 y2 but as we'll see it really doesn't matter which one is which plugging into our formula we get d is the square root of x2 minus x1 so that's 4 minus negative 1 squared and then we add y2 minus y1 so that's 2 minus 5 squared working out the arithmetic a little bit 4 minus negative 1 that's 4 plus 1 or 5 squared plus negative 3 squared so that's the square root of 25 plus 9 or the square root of 34. let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point x2 y2 instead and the second point x1 y1 then we would have gotten the same distance formula but we would have taken negative 1 minus 4 and added the difference of y's squared so that's y2 5 minus 2 squared so that gives us the square root of negative 5 squared plus 3 squared which works out to the same thing in this video we use the distance formula to find the distance between two points when writing down the distance formula sometimes students forget whether this is a plus or minus and whether these are pluses or minuses one way to remember is to think that the distance formula comes from the pythagorean theorem that's why there's a plus in here and then a minus in here because we're getting the difference between the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides the midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints so let's call the coordinates of this endpoint x1 y1 and the coordinates of this other endpoint x2 y2 the xcoordinate of the midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between the xcoordinates of the endpoints to get a number halfway in between two other numbers we just take the average similarly the ycoordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between the ycoordinates of the endpoints so the ycoordinate of the midpoint is going to be the average of those ycoordinates so we see that the coordinates of the midpoint are x1 plus x2 over 2 y1 plus y2 over 2. let's use this midpoint formula in an example we want to find the midpoint of the segment between the points negative 1 5 and 4 2. let me draw the line segment between them so visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere around here but to find its exact coordinates we're going to use x1 plus x2 over 2 and y1 plus y2 over 2 where this first point is coordinates x1 y1 and the second point has coordinates x2 y2 it doesn't actually matter which point you decide is x1 y1 and which one is x2 y2 the formula will still give you the same answer for the midpoint so let's see i take my average of my x coordinates so that's negative 1 plus 4 over 2 and the average of my y coordinates so that's 5 plus 2 over 2 and i get 3 halves 7 halves as the coordinates of my midpoint in this video we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment just by taking the average of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates this video is about graphs and equations of circles suppose we want to find the equation of a circle of radius 5 centered at the point 3 2. it'll look something like this for any point x y on the circle we know that the distance of that point x y from the center is equal to the radius that is 5. from the distance formula that distance of 5 is equal to the square root of the difference of the x coordinates that's x minus 3 squared plus the difference of the y coordinates that's y minus 2 squared and if i square both sides of that equation i get 5 squared is this square root squared in other words 25 is equal to x minus 3 squared plus y minus 2 squared since the square root and the squared undo each other a lot of times people will write the x minus 3 squared plus y minus 2 squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right side of the equation this is the standard form for the equation of this circle this same reasoning can be generalized to find a general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point h k for any point with coordinates x y on the circle the distance between the point with coordinates x y and the point with coordinates h k is equal to the radius r so we have that the distance is equal to r but by the distance formula that's the square root of the difference between the x coordinates x minus h squared plus the difference in the y coordinates y minus k squared squaring both sides as before we get r squared is the square root squared canceling the square root and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared that's the general formula for a circle with radius r and center h k notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here the two squares are added because they are in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the other side if you remember this general formula that makes it easy to write down the equation for a circle for example if we want the equation for a circle of radius 6 and center at zero negative three then we have r equals six and h k is our zero negative three so plugging into the formula we get x minus 0 squared plus y minus negative 3 squared equals 6 squared or simplified this is x squared plus y plus 3 squared equals 36. suppose we're given an equation like this one and we want to decide if it's the equation of a circle and if so what's the center and what's the radius well this equation matches the form for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared if we let h be 5 y be negative 6 since that way subtracting a negative six is like adding a six five must be our r squared so that means that r is the square root of five so this is our radius and our center is the point 5 negative 6. and this is indeed the equation for a circle which we could then graph by putting down the center and estimating the radius which is a little bit more than 2. this equation might not look like the equation of a circle but it actually can be transformed to look like the equation of a circle we're trying to make it look like something of the form x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared first i'd like to get rid of the coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared so i'm going to divide everything by 9. this gives me x squared plus y squared plus 8x minus 2y plus 4 equals 0. next i'm going to group the x terms together the x squared and the 8x so i'll write x squared plus 8x i'll group the y terms together the y squared minus 2y and i'll subtract the 4 over to the other side this still doesn't look much like the equation of a circle but as the next step i'm going to do something called completing the square i'm going to take this coefficient of x 8 divide it by 2 and then square it in other words 8 over 2 squared that's 4 squared which is 16. i'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation so i'll add the 16 here and on the other side now i'm going to do the same thing to the coefficient of y negative 2 divided by 2 is negative 1 square that and i get 1. so now i'm going to add a 1 to both sides but i'll put it near the y terms so i add a 1 there and then to keep things balanced i have to add it to the other side on the right side i have the number 13. on the left side i can wrap up this expression x squared plus 8x plus 16 into x plus 4 squared to convince you that's correct if we multiply out x plus 4 times x plus 4 we get x squared plus 4x plus 4x plus 16 or x squared plus 8x plus 16. the same thing we have right here similarly we can wrap up y squared minus 2y plus 1 as y minus 1 squared again i'll work out the distribution down here that's y squared minus y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one just like we have up here if you're wondering how i knew to use four and minus one the four came from taking half of 8 and the minus 1 came from taking half the negative 2. now we have an equation for a circle in standard form and we can read off the center which is negative 4 negative 1 and the radius which is the square root of 13. it might seem like magic that this trick of taking half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides lets us wrap up this expression into this expression that's perfect square but to see why that works let's take a look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared the thing that we're trying to get to so if we expand that out x minus h squared which is x minus h times x minus h is which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared or x squared minus 2hx plus h squared now if we start out with this part with some x squared term and some coefficient of x and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h squared the thing to add on is h squared here which comes from half of this coefficient squared right because half of negative 2h is 8 negative h square that you get the h squared and then when we do wrap it up it's half of this coefficient of x that appears right here this trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a circle in disguise into the standard equation for the circle in this video we found the standard equation for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared where r is the radius and h k is the center we also showed a method of completing the square when you have an equation for a circle in disguise completing the square will help you rewrite it into the standard form this video is about graphs and equations of lines here we're given the graph of a line we want to find the equation one standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b here m represents the slope and b represents the yintercept the yvalue where the line crosses the yaxis the slope is equal to the rise over the run or sometimes this is written as the change in y values over the change in x values or in other words y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 where x1 y1 and x2 y2 are points on the line while we could use any two points on the line to find the slope it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers that is points where the line passes through grid points so here would be one convenient point to use and here's another convenient point to use the coordinates of the first point are 1 2 and the next point this is let's see 5 negative 1. now i can find the slope by looking at the rise over the run so as i go through a run of this distance i go through a rise of that distance it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down so let's see counting off squares this is a run of 1 2 3 four squares and a rise of one two three so negative three so my slope is going to be negative three over four i got that answer by counting squares but i could have also gotten it by looking at the difference in my y values over the difference of my x values that is i could have done negative 1 minus 2 that's from my difference in y values and divide that by my difference in x values which is 5 minus 1 that gives me negative 3 over 4 as before so my m is negative threefourths now i need to figure out the value of b my yintercept well i could just read it off the graph it looks like approximately 2.75 but if i want to be more accurate i can again use a point that has integer coordinates that i know its exact coordinates so either this point or that point let's try this point and i can start off with my equation y equals mx plus b that is y equals negative 3 4 x plus b and i can plug in the point 1 2 for my x and y so that gives me 2 equals negative 3 4 times 1 plus b solving for b let's see that's 2 equals negative 3 4 plus b so add 3 4 to both sides that's 2 plus 3 4 equals b so b is 8 4 plus 3 4 which is 11 4 which is actually just what i eyeballed it to be so now i can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative 3 4 x plus 11 4 by plugging in for m and b next let's find the equation for this horizontal line horizontal line has slope zero so if we think of it as y equals mx plus b m is going to be zero in other words it's just y equals b y is some constant so if we can figure out what that that constant y value is it looks like it's uh 2 let's see that's 3 3 and a half we can just write down the equation directly y equals 3.5 for a vertical line like this one it doesn't really have a slope i mean if you tried to do the rise over the run there's no run so you i guess you'd be dividing by zero and get an infinite slope but but instead we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something and in this case x equals negative 2 notice that all of the points on our line have the same x coordinate of negative 2 and the y coordinate can be anything so this is how we write the equation for a vertical line in this example we're not shown a graph of the line we're just told that it goes through two points but knowing that it goes through two points is enough to find the equation for the line first we can find the slope by taking the difference in y values over the difference in x values so that's negative three minus two over four minus one which is negative five thirds so we can use the standard equation for the line this is called the slope intercept form and we can plug in negative five thirds and we can use one point either one will do we'll still get the same final answer so let's use 1 2 and plug that in to get 2 equals negative 5 thirds times 1 plus b and so b is 2 plus five thirds which is sixthirds plus fivethirds which is eleventhirds so our equation is y equals negative fivethirds x plus eleventhirds this is method one method two uses a slightly different form of the equation it's called the point slope form and it goes y minus y naught is equal to m times x minus x naught where x naught y naught is a point on the line and m again is the slope so we calculate the slope the same way by taking a difference in y values over difference in x values but then we can simply plug in any point for example the point 1 2 will work we can plug 1 in for x naught and 2 in for y naught in this pointslope form that gives us y minus 2 is equal to minus 5 thirds x minus 1. notice that these two equations while they may look different are actually equivalent because if i distribute the negative 5 thirds and then add the 2 to both sides i get the same equation as above so we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line using the slopeintercept form and using the pointslope form in this video we saw that you can find the equation for a line if you know the slope and you know one point you can also find the equation for the line if you know two points because you can use the two points to get the slope and then plug in one of those points to figure out the rest of the equation we saw two standard forms for the equation of a line the slopeintercept form y equals mx plus b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept and the pointslope form y minus ynaught equals m times x minus xnaught where m again is the slope and naught y naught is a point on the line this video is about finding parallel and perpendicular lines suppose we have a line of slope 3 4 in other words the rise over the run is three over four then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the same slope the same rise over run so that's our first fact to keep in mind parallel lines have the same slopes suppose on the other hand we want to find a line perpendicular to our original line with its original slope of 3 4. a perpendicular line in other words a line at a 90 degree angle to our original line will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal of the opposite reciprocal of our original slope so we take the reciprocal of threefourths that's fourthirds and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative so i'll write this as a principle that perpendiculars lines have opposite reciprocal slopes to get the hang of what it means to be an opposite reciprocal let's look at a few examples so here's the original slope and this will be the opposite reciprocal which would represent the slope of our perpendicular line so for example if m1 was 2 then the opposite reciprocal reciprocal of 2 is onehalf opposite means i change the sign if the first slope turned out to be say negative 1 3 the reciprocal of 1 3 is 3 over 1 or just 3 and the opposite means i change it from a negative to a positive so my perpendicular slope would be would be 3. one more example if i started off with the slope of say 7 halves then the reciprocal of that would be 2 7 and i change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive to a negative let's use these two principles in some examples in our first example we need to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this lump and goes through the point negative 3 2. well in order to get started i need to figure out the slope of this line so let me put this line into a more standard form the the slopeintercept form so i'll start with 3y minus 4x plus 6 equals 0. i'm going to solve for y to put it in this this more standard form so i'll say 3y equals 4x minus 6 and then divide by 3 to get y equals 4 3x minus 6 thirds i've divided all my terms by 3 i can simplify that a little bit y equals 4 3 x minus 2. now i can read off the slope of my original line and 1 is 4 3. that means my slope of my new line my parallel line will also be four thirds so my new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus b for some b of course b will probably not be negative two like it was for the first line it'll be something else determined by the fact that it goes through this point negative 3 2. to figure out what b is i'll plug in the point negative 3 2 for negative 3 for x and 2 for y so that gives me 2 equals 4 3 times negative 3 plus b and i'll solve for b so let's see first let me just simplify so 2 equals this is negative 12 thirds plus b or in other words two is negative four plus b so that means that b is going to be six and my my parallel line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus six next let's find the equation of a line that's perpendicular to a given line through and go through a given point again in order to get started i need to find what the slope of this given line is so i'll rewrite it well first i'll just copy it over 6x plus 3y equals 4 and then i can put it in the standard slope intercept form by solving for y so 3y is negative six x plus four divide everything by three i get y equals negative six thirds x plus four thirds so y is negative two x plus four thirds so on my original slope of my original line is negative two which means my perpendicular slope is the opposite reciprocal so i take the reciprocal of of negative two that's negative one half and i change the sign so that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line now my new line i know is going to be y equals onehalf x plus b for some b and i can plug in my point on my new line so 1 for y and 4 for x and solve for b so i get 1 equals 2 plus b so b is negative 1 and so my new line has equation 1 half x minus one these next two examples are a little bit different because now we're looking at a line parallel to a completely horizontal line let me draw this line y equals 3. so the ycoordinate is always 3 which means that my line will be a horizontal line through that height y equals 3. if i want something parallel to this line it will also be a horizontal line since it goes through the point negative 2 1 let's see negative 2 1 it has to go through that point there it's going to have always have a ycoordinate of 1 the same as the ycoordinate of the point it goes through so my answer will just be y equals 1. in the next example we want a line that's perpendicular to the line y equals 4 another horizontal line y equals 4. but perpendicular means i'm going to need a vertical line so i need a vertical line that goes through the point 3 4 okay and so i'm going to draw a vertical line there now vertical lines have the form x equals something for their equation and to find what x equals i just need to look at the x coordinate of the point i'm going through this point 3 4. so that x coordinate is 3 and all the points on this this perpendicular and vertical line have x coordinate 3 so my answer is x equals 3. in this video we use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope and perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines this video introduces functions and their domains and ranges a function is a correspondence between input numbers usually the x values and output numbers usually the y values that sends each input number to exactly one output number sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get out y values as output so a nonmathematical example of a function might be the biological mother function which takes as input any person and gives us output their biological mother this function satisfies the condition that each input number object person in this case gets sent to exactly one output person because if you take any person they just have one biological mother so that rule does give you a function but if i change things around and just use the the mother function which sends to each person their mother that's no longer going to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother right they could have a biological mother an adopted mother or or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations so since there's there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd get like more than one possible output that violates this this rule of functions it would not be a function now most the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations not in terms of mothers so for example we could have the function y equals x squared plus one this can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one here f of x is function notation that stands for the output value of y notice that this notation is not representing multiplication we're not multiplying f by x instead we're going to be putting in a value for x as input and getting out a value of f x or y for example if we want to evaluate f of 2 we're plugging in 2 as input for x either in this equation or in that equation since f of 2 means 2 squared plus 1 f of 2 is going to equal 5. similarly f of 5 means i plug in 5 for x so that's going to be 5 squared plus 1 or 26. sometimes it's useful to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables in this case remember the function's value on any expression is just when you what you get when you plug in that whole expression for x so f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus three squared plus one we could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus 9 plus 1 or a squared plus 6a plus 10. when evaluating a function on a complex expression it's important to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x that way you evaluate the function on the whole expression for example it would be wrong to write f of a plus 3 equals a plus 3 squared plus 1 without the parentheses because that would imply we were just squaring the 3 and not the whole expression a plus 3. sometimes a function is described with a graph instead of an equation in this example this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x not all graphs actually represent functions for example the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function that's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical line test you can draw a vertical line and it'll intersect the graph in more than one point but our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point that means it's a function because every x value will have at most one y value that corresponds to it let's evaluate g of two note that two is an x value and we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value so i look for 2 on the x axis and find the point on the graph that has that x value that's right here now i can look at the y value of that point looks like 3 and therefore g of 2 is equal to 3. if i try to do the same thing to evaluate g of 5 i run into trouble 5 is an x value i look for it on the x axis but there's no point on the graph that has that x value therefore g of 5 is undefined or we can say it does not exist the question of what x values and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range the domain of a function is all possible x values that make sense for that function the range is the y values that make sense for the function in this example we saw that the x value of 5 didn't have a corresponding y value for this function so the x value of 5 is not in the domain of our function g to find the x values in the domain we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on the graph one way to do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the xaxis and see what x values are hit it looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative 8 and continuing up to 4. so our domain is the x's between negative 8 and 4 including those endpoints or we can write this in interval notation as negative 8 comma 4 with square brackets to find the range of the function we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph we can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis we seem to be hitting all y values from negative 5 up through 3 so our range is y is between negative 5 and 3 we're in interval notation negative 5 3 with square brackets if we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function but it's often possible to find the domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations we think about what x values it makes sense to plug into this expression and what x values need to be excluded because they make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate specifically to find the domain of a function we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero since we can't divide by zero we also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative since we can't take the square root of a negative number in fact we need to exclude values that make an expression inside any even root negative because we can't take an even root of a negative number even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number later when we look at logarithmic functions we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to make but for now these two principles should handle all functions we'll see so let's apply them to a couple examples for the function in part a we don't have any square root signs but we do have a denominator so we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero in other words we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero if we solve x squared minus 4x plus 3 equal to 0 we can do that by factoring and that gives us x equals 3 or x equals 1. so we need to exclude these values all other x values should be fine so if i draw the number line i can put on 1 and 3 and just dig out a hole at both of those and my domain includes everything else on the number line in interval notation this means my domain is everything from negative infinity to 1 together with everything from 1 to 3 together with everything from 3 to infinity in this second example we don't have any denominators to worry about but we do have a square root sign so we need to exclude any x values that make 3 minus 2x less than 0. in other words we can include all x values for which three minus two x is greater than or equal to zero solving that inequality gives us three is greater than or equal to two x in other words x is less than or equal to three halves i can draw this on the number line or write it in interval notation notice that three halves is included and that's because three minus 2x is allowed to be zero i can take the square root of zero it's just zero and that's not a problem finally let's look at a more complicated function that involves both a square root and a denominator now there are two things i need to worry about i need the denominator to not be equal to zero and i need the stuff inside the square root sign to be greater than or equal to zero from our earlier work we know that the first condition means that x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one and the second condition means that x is less than or equal to three halves let's draw both of those conditions on the number line x is not equal to 3 and x is not equal to 1 means we've got everything except those two dugout points and the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it now to be in our domain and to be legit for our function we need both of these conditions to be true so i'm going to connect these conditions with an and and that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are colored both red and blue so i'll draw that above in purple so that's everything from three halves to one i have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator and then i can continue for all the things that are colored both both colors red and blue so my final domain is going to be let's see negative infinity up to but not including one together with one but not including it to three halves and i include three halves since that was colored both red and blue also in this video we talked about functions how to evaluate them and how to find domains and ranges this video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that i call the toolkit functions the first function is the function y equals x let's plot a few points on the graph of this function if x is 0 y 0 if x is 1 y is 1 and so on y is always equal to x it doesn't have to just be an integer it can be any real number and while connecting the dots we get a straight line through the origin let's look at the graph of y equals x squared if x is zero y is zero so we go through the origin again if x is one y is 1 and if x is negative 1 y is also 1. the x value of 2 gives a y value of 4 and the x value of negative 2 gives a y value of 4 also connecting the dots we get a parabola notice this this function is an even function that means it has mirror symmetry across the yaxis the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side that happens because when you square a positive number like 2 you get the exact same y value as when you square its mirror image x value of negative two the next function y equals x cubed i'll call that a cubic let's plot a few points when x is zero y is zero when x is one y is one when x is negative 1 y is negative 1. 2 goes with the point 8 way up here and an x value of negative 2 is going to give us negative 8. if i connect the dots i get something that looks kind of like this this function is what's called an odd function because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry acro around the origin if i rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees or in other words turn the paper upside down i'll get exactly the same shape the reason this function has this odd symmetry is because when i cube a positive number and get its y value i get and cube the the corresponding negative number to get its y value the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of the the y value we get with cubing the positive number let's look at the next example y equals the square root of x notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or equal to 0 because we can't take the square root of a negative number let's plug in a few x values x is zero gives y zero x is one square root of one is one square root of four is two and connecting the dots i get a function that looks like this the absolute value function is next again if we plug in a few points x is zero goes with y equals zero x is one gives us one the absolute value of negative one is 1. 2 2 is on the graph and the absolute value of negative 2 is 2. i'm ending up getting a vshaped graph it also has even or mirror symmetry y equals 2 to the x is what's known as an exponential function that's because the variable x is in the exponent if i plot a few points two to the zero is one two to the one is two two squared is four two to the minus one is one half i'll plot these on my graph and let me fill in a few more points so let's see 2 cubed is 8 that's way up here and negative 2 gives me 1 4 1 8. connecting the dots i get something that's shaped like this you might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about for example population growth this is function is represents exponential growth it it grows very very steeply every time we increase the x coordinate by 1 we double the y coordinate we could also look at a function like y equals 3 to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x where e is just a number about 2.7 these functions look very similar it's just the bigger base makes us rise a little more steeply now let's look at the function y equals one over x it's not defined when x is zero but i can plug in x equals one half one over one half is two uh one over one is one and one over two is one half if i connect the dots i get this shape in the first quadrant but i haven't looked at negative values of x when x is negative one over negative one is negative one 1 over negative a half is negative 2 and i get a similar looking piece in the third quadrant this is an example of a hyperbola and it's also an odd function because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry if i turn the page upside down it'll look exactly the same finally let's look at y equals one over x squared again it's not defined when x is zero but i can plug in points like onehalf for x let's see one over onehalf squared is one over onefourth which is four and one over one squared one over two squared is a fourth it looks pretty much like the previous function is just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply falls a little more dramatically but for negative values of x something a little bit different goes on for example 1 over negative 2 squared is just 1 over 4 which is a fourth so i can plot that point there and 1 over negative 1 squared that's just 1. so my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant not the third quadrant this is an example of an even function because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the yaxis these are the toolkit functions and i recommend you memorize the shape of each of them that way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points that's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions if we change the equation of a function then the graph of the function changes or transforms in predictable ways this video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions to get the most out of this video it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some typical functions i call them toolkit functions like y equals square root of x y equals x squared y equals the absolute value of x and so on if you're not familiar with those graphs i encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one i want to start by reviewing function notation if g of x represents the function the square root of x then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots for example g of x minus 2 is the same thing as the square root of x minus 2. g of quantity x minus 2 means we plug in x minus 2 everywhere we see an x so that would be the same thing as the square root of quantity x minus 2. in this second example i say that we're subtracting 2 on the inside of the function because we're subtracting 2 before we apply the square root function whereas on the first example i say that the minus 2 is on the outside of the function we're doing the square root function first and then subtracting 2. in this third example g of 3x we're multiplying by 3 on the inside of the function to evaluate this in terms of square root we plug in the entire 3x for x in the square root function that gives us the square root of 3x in the next example we're multiplying by 3 on the outside of the function this is just 3 times the square root of x finally g of minus x means the square root of minus x this might look a little odd because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number but remember that if x itself is negative like negative 2 then negative x will be negative negative 2 or positive 2 so we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my function in this next set of examples we're using the same function g of x squared of x but this time we're starting with an expression with square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x so the first example the plus 17 is on the outside of my function because i'm taking the square root of x first and then adding 17. so i can write this as g of x plus 17. in the second example i'm taking x and adding 12 first then i take the square root of the whole thing since i'm adding the 12 to x first that's on the inside of my function so i write that as g of the quantity x plus 12. remember that this notation means i plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. in this next example i'm doing the square root first and then multiplying by negative 36. so my minus 36 multiplication is outside my function i can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x finally in this last example i take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x so that's the same thing as g of onefourth x my onefourth x is on the inside of my function in other words it's inside the parentheses when i use function notation let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function y equals the square root of x goes through the points 0 0 1 1 and 4 2 since the square root of 4 is 2 and looks something like this in order to graph y equals the square root of x minus 2 notice that the minus 2 is on the outside of the function that means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract 2. so for example if we start with the x value of 0 and compute the square root of 0 that's 0 then we subtract 2 to give us a y value of negative 2. an x value of 1 which under the square root function had a y value of 1 now has a y value that's decreased by 2. one minus two is negative one and finally an x value of four which under the square root function had a y value of two now has a y value of two minus two or zero its y value was also decreased by two if i plot these new points zero goes with negative two one goes with negative one and four goes with zero i have my transformed graph because i subtracted two on the outside of my function my y values were decreased by two which brought my graph down by two units next let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two now we're subtracting 2 on the inside of our function which means we subtract 2 from x first and then take the square root in order to get the same y value of 0 as we had in our blue graph we need our x minus 2 to be 0 so we need our original x to be 2. in order to get the y value of 1 that we had in our blue graph we need to be taking the square root of 1. so we need x minus 2 to be 1 which means that we need to start with an x value of 3. and in order to reproduce our y value of 2 from our original graph we need the square root of x minus 2 to be 2 which means we need to start out by taking the square root of 4 which means our x minus 2 is 4 so our x should be up there at 6. if i plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus 2 i get the following graph notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two units to me moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two so we're decreasing y's by two units but the minus two on the inside that kind of does the opposite of what i expect i might expect it to to move the graph left i might expect the x values to be going down by two units but instead it moves the graph to the right because the x units have to go up by two units in order to get the right square root when i then subtract two units again the observations we made for these transformations of functions hold in general according to the following rules first of all numbers on the outside of the function like in our example y equals the square root of x minus 2 those numbers affect the y values and result in vertical motions like we saw these motions are in the direction you expect so subtracting 2 moves us down by 2 if we were adding 2 instead that would move us up by 2. numbers on the inside of the function that's like our example y equals the square root of quantity x minus 2. those affect the x values and result in a horizontal motion these motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect remember the minus 2 on the inside actually shifted our graph to the right if it had a plus 2 on the inside that would actually shift our graph to the left adding results in a shift those are called translations but multiplying like something like y equals 3 times the square root of x that would result in a stretch or shrink in other words if i start with the square root of x and then want to graph y equals 3 times the square root of x that stretches my graph vertically by a factor of 3 like this if i want to graph y equals onethird times the square root of x that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of onethird finally a negative sign results in reflection for example if i start with a graph of y equals the square root of x and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x that's going to do a reflection in the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign a reflection in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the yaxis if instead i want to graph y equals negative the square root of x that negative sign on the outside means a vertical reflection a reflection across the xaxis pause the video for a moment and see if you can describe what happens in these four transformations in the first example we're subtracting 4 on the outside of the function adding and subtracting means a translation or shift and since we're on the outside of the function it affects the y values that's moving us vertically so this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down by 4 units that would look something like this in the next example we're adding 12 on the inside that's still a translation but now we're moving horizontally and so since we go the opposite direction we expect we are going to go to the left by 12 units that's going to look something like this in the next example we're multiplying by 3 and introducing a negative sign both on the outside of our function outside our function means we're affecting the y values so and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of 3. the negative sign means we reflect in the vertical direction here's stretching by a factor of 3 vertically before i apply the minus sign and now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction finally in this last example we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function we know that multiplication means stretch or shrink and since we're on the inside it's a horizontal motion and it does the opposite of what we expect so instead of shrinking by a factor of onefourth horizontally it's actually going to stretch by the reciprocal a factor of four horizontally that'll look something like this notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of 4 looks kind of like shrinking vertically by a factor of one half and that's actually borne out by the algebra because the square root of 1 4 x is the same thing as the square root of 1 4 times the square root of x which is the same thing as onehalf times the square root of x and so now we can see algebraically that a vertical shrink by a factor of onehalf is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of at least for this function the square root function this video gave some rules for transformations of functions which i'll repeat below numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values or vertical motions numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values and result in horizontal motions adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks and putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection a horizontal reflection if the negative sign is on the inside and a vertical reflection if the negative sign is on the outside knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions like y equals 3 times the square root of x plus 2 by simply considering the transformations one at a time a quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a x squared plus b x plus c where a b and c are real numbers and a is not equal to zero the reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero we'd have f of x is equal to b x plus c which is called a linear function so by making sure that a is not zero we make sure there's really an x squared term which is the hallmark of a quadratic function please pause the video for a moment and decide which of these equations represent quadratic functions the first function can definitely be written in the form g of x equals a x squared plus b x plus c in fact it's already written in that form where a is negative 5 b is 10 and c is 3. the second equation is also a quadratic function because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times x plus zero so it is in the right form where a is one b is zero and c is zero it's perfectly fine for the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function we just need the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero so the x squared term is preserved the third equation is not a quadratic function it's a linear function because there's no x squared term the fourth function might not look like a quadratic function but if we rewrite it by expanding out the x minus 3 squared let's see what happens we get y equals 2 times x minus 3 times x minus 3 plus 4 so that's 2 times x squared minus 3x minus 3x plus 9 plus 4. continuing i get 2 x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus 4 in other words y equals 2x squared minus 12x plus 22 so in fact our function can be written in the right form and it is a quadratic function a function that is already written in the form y equals ax squared plus bx plus c is said to be in standard form so our first example g of x is in standard form a function that's written in the format of the last function that is in the form of y equals a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a h and k that's said to be in vertex form i'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another video in this video we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between standard form and vertex form this video is about graphing quadratic functions a quadratic function which is typically written in standard form like this or sometimes in vertex form like this always has the graph that looks like a parabola this video will show how to tell whether the parabola is pointing up or down how to find its xintercept and how to find its vertex the barebones basic quadratic function is f of x equals x squared it goes to the origin since f of zero is zero squared which is zero and it is a parabola pointing upwards like this the vertex of a parabola is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards and its highest point if it's pointing downwards so in this case the vertex is at 0 0. the xintercepts are where the graph crosses the xaxis in other words where y is zero and in this function y equals zero means that x squared is zero which happens only when x is zero so the xintercept there's only one of them is also zero this second function y equals negative three x squared also goes through the origin since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero but in this case the parabola is pointing downwards that's because thinking about transformations of functions a negative sign on the outside reflects the function vertically over the xaxis making the parabola instead of pointing upwards reflecting the point downwards the number three on the outside stretches the graph vertically by a factor of three so it makes it kind of long and skinny like this in general a negative coefficient to the x squared term means the parabola will be pointing down whereas a positive coefficient like here the coefficient's 1 means the parabola is pointing up i'll write that rule over here so if a is bigger than 0 the parabola opens up and if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero then the parabola opens down in this second example we can see again that the vertex is at zero zero and the x intercept is x equals zero let's look at this third example if we multiplied our expression out we'd see that the coefficient of x squared would be 2 a positive number so that means our parabola is going to be opening up but the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin in fact we can find the parabolas vertex by thinking about transformations of functions our function is related to the function y equals 2x squared by moving it to the right by 3 and up by 4. since y equals 2x squared has a vertex at 0 0 if we move that whole parabola including the vertex right by three and up by four the vertex will end up at the point three four so a parabola will look something like this notice how easy it was to just read off the vertex when our quadratic function is written in this form in fact any parabola any quadratic function written in the form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex at h k by the same reasoning we're moving the parabola with a vertex at the origin to the right by h and by k that's why this form of a quadratic function is called the vertex form notice that this parabola has no xintercepts because it does not cross the xaxis for our final function we have g of x equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3. we know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards because the coefficient of x squared is positive to find the xintercepts we can set y equals zero since the xintercepts is where our graph crosses the xaxis and that's where the yvalue is zero so 0 equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3 i'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve that so x is negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 10 squared minus 4 times 5 times 3 all over 2 times 5. that simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 40 over 10 which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the square root of 40 over 10 which is negative 1 plus or minus 2 square root of 10 over 10 or negative 1 plus or minus square root of 10 over 5. since the square root of 10 is just a little bit bigger than 3 this works out to approximately about negative twofifths and negative eightfifths so somewhere around right here so our parabola is going to look something like this notice that it goes through crosses the xaxis at y equals 3 that's because when we plug in x equals 0 into here we get y equal 3. so the yintercept is at 3. finally we can find the vertex since this function is written in standard form the y equals ax plus x squared plus bx plus c form and not in vertex form we can't just read off the vertex like we could before but there's a trick called the vertex formula which says that whenever you have a function in a quadratic function in standard form the vertex has an x coordinate of negative b over 2a so in this case that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over 2 times 5 or negative 1 which is kind of like where i put it on the graph to find the y coordinate of that vertex i can just plug in negative 1 into my equation for x which gives me y equals 5 times negative 1 squared plus 10 times negative 1 plus 3 which is negative 2. so i think i better redraw my graph a little bit to put that vertex down at a y coordinate of negative 2 where it's supposed to be let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions first of all the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola the parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared which we call a is greater than zero and down if a is less than zero to find the x intercepts we set y equal to zero or in other words f of x equal to zero and solve for x to find the vertex we can either read it off as h k if our function is in vertex form or we can use the vertex formula and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over 2a if our function is in standard form to find the ycoordinate of the vertex in this case we just plug in the xcoordinate and figure out what y is finally we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in values of x in this video we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions in particular we saw that the vertex can be read off as h k if our function is written in vertex form and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated as negative b over 2a if our function is in a standard form for an explanation of why this vertex formula works please see it in my other video a quadratic in standard form looks like y equals a x squared plus b x plus c where a b and c are real numbers and a is not zero a quadratic function in vertex form looks like y equals a times x minus h squared plus k where a h and k are real numbers and a is not zero when a function's in vertex form it's easy to read off the vertex it's just the ordered pair h k this video explains how to get from vertex form to standard form and vice versa let's start by converting this quadratic function from vertex form to standard form that's pretty straightforward we just have to distribute out so if i multiply out the x minus 3 squared i get minus 4 times x squared minus 6x plus 9 plus 1. distributing the negative 4 i get negative 4x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus 1 so that works out to minus 4x squared plus 24x minus 35 and i have my quadratic function now in standard form now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function that's already in standard form into vertex form that is we want to put it in the form of g of x equals a times x minus h squared plus k where the vertex is at h k to do this it's handy to use the vertex formula the vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative b over 2a where a is the coefficient of x squared and b is the coefficient of x so in this case we get an x coordinate of negative 8 over 2 times 2 or negative 2. to find the ycoordinate of the vertex we just plug in the xcoordinate into our formula for g of x so that's g of negative 2 which is 2 times negative 2 squared plus 8 times negative 2 plus 6 and that works out to be negative 2 by coincidence so the vertex for our quadratic function has coordinates negative 2 negative 2. and if i want to write g of x in vertex form it's going to be a times x minus negative 2 squared plus minus 2 that's because remember we subtract h and we add k so that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus 2 squared minus 2 and finally we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is but notice if we were to multiply distribute this out then the coefficient of x squared would end up being a so therefore the coefficient of x squared here which is a has to be the same as the coefficient of x squared here which we can immediately also call a in other words our a down here needs to be 2. so i'm going to write that as g of x equals 2 times x plus 2 squared minus 2 lots of twos in this problem and that's our quadratic function in vertex form if i want to check my answer of course i could just distribute out again i'd get 2 times x squared plus 4x plus 2 minus 2 in other words 2x squared plus 8x plus 6 which checks out to exactly what i started with this video showed how to get from vertex form to standard form by distributing out and how to get from standard form to vertex form by finding the vertex using the vertex formula suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals ax squared plus bx plus c and you want to find where the vertex is when you graph it the vertex formula says that the xcoordinate of this vertex is at negative b over 2a this video gives a justification for where that formula comes from let's start with a specific example suppose i wanted to find the xintercepts and the vertex for this quadratic function to find the xintercepts i would set y equal to zero and solve for x so that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five and to solve for x i use the quadratic formula so x is gonna be negative seven plus or minus the square root of seven squared minus four times three times negative five all over two times three that simplifies to negative seven a plus or minus the square root of a hundred and nine over six we could i could also write this as negative seven sixth plus the square root of a hundred and nine over six or x equals negative seven six minus the square root of 109 over six since the square root of a hundred and nine is just a little bit bigger than ten this can be approximated by negative seven sixths plus ten sixths and negative seven sixth minus ten sixths 6. so pretty close to i guess about what half over here and pretty close to about negative 3 over here i'm just going to estimate so that i can draw a picture of the function since the leading coefficient 3 is positive i know my parabola is going to be opening up and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here so roughly speaking it's going to look something like this now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two xintercepts in fact it's going to be by symmetry it'll be exactly halfway in between the two xintercepts since the xintercepts are negative 7 6 plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over 6 the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative 7 6 right because on the one hand i have negative 7 6 plus something and on the other hand i have negative 7 6 minus that same thing so negative 7 6 will be exactly in the middle so my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative 7 6. notice that i got that number from the quadratic formula more generally if i want to find the xintercepts for any quadratic function i set y equal to 0 and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a the xintercepts will be at these two values but the xcoordinate of the vertex which is exactly halfway in between the two xintercepts will be at negative b over 2a that's where the vertex formula comes from and it turns out that this formula works even when there are no xintercepts even when the the quadratic formula gives us no solutions the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over 2a and that's the justification of the vertex formula this video is about polynomials and their graphs recall that a polynomial is a function like this one for example whose terms are numbers times powers of x i'll start with some definitions the degree of a polynomial is the largest exponent for example for this polynomial the degree is four the leading term is the term with the largest exponent in the same example the leading term is 5x to the fourth it's conventional to write the polynomial in descending order of powers of x so the leading term is first but the leading term doesn't have to be the first term if i wrote this same polynomial as y equals say 2 minus 17x minus 21x cubed plus 5x4 the leading term would still be the 5x to the fourth even though it was last the leading coefficient is the number in the leading term in this example the leading coefficient is 5. finally the constant term is the term with no x's in it in our same example the constant term is 2. please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example of polynomial figure out what's the degree the leading term the leading coefficient and the constant term the degree is again four since that's the highest power we have and the leading term is negative seven x to the fourth the leading coefficient is negative 7 and the constant term is 18. in the graph of the polynomial shown here the three marked points are called turning points because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points those same points can also be called local extreme points or they can be called local maximum and minimum points for this polynomial the degree is 4 and the number of turning points is 3. let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three examples for the first one the degree is two and there's one turning point for the second example the degree is three and there's two turning points and for this last example the degree is four and there's one turning point for this first example and the next two the number of turning points is exactly one less than the degree so you might conjecture that this is always true but in fact this is not always true in this last example the degree is four but the number of turning points is one not three in fact it turns out that while the number of turning points is not always equal to the degree minus one it is always less than or equal to the degree minus one that's a useful fact to remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs of polynomials the end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger and bigger heads towards infinity or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative infinity in this first example the graph of the function goes down as x gets towards infinity as x goes towards negative infinity i can draw this with two little arrows pointing down on either side or i can say in words that the function is falling as we head left and falling also as we head right in this second example the graph rises to the left and rises to the right in the third example the graph falls to the left but rises to the right and in the fourth example it rises to the left and falls to the right if you study these examples and others you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial the leading coefficients of the polynomials and the end behavior specifically these four types of end behavior are determined by whether the degree is even or odd and by whether the leading coefficient is positive or negative the degree is even and the leading coefficient is positive like in this example where the leading coefficient is one we have this sorts of end behavior rising on both sides when the degree is even and the leading coefficient is negative like in this example we have the end behavior that's falling on both that sides when the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is positive that's like this example with the degree 3 and a leading coefficient 3 then we have this sort of end behavior and finally when the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is negative like in this example we have this sort of end behavior i like to remember this chart just by thinking of the most simple examples y equals x squared y equals negative x squared y equals x cubed and y equals negative x cubed because i know by heart what those four examples look like then i just have to remember that any polynomial with a even degree and positive leading coefficient has the same end behavior as x squared and similarly any polynomial with even degree and negative leading coefficient has the same end behavior as negative x squared and similar statements for x cubed and negative x cubed we can use facts about turning points and end behavior to say something about the equation of a polynomial just by looking at its graph in this example because of the end behavior we know that the degree is odd we know that the leading coefficient must be positive and finally since there are one two three four turning points we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five that's because the number of turning points is less than or equal to the degree minus 1 and in this case the number of turning points we said was 4 and so solving that inequality we get the degree is big or equal to 5. putting some of that information together we see the degree could be 5 or 7 or 9 or any odd number greater than or equal to 5 but it couldn't be for example 3 or 6 because even numbers and and also numbers less than 5 are right out this video gave a lot of definitions including the definition of degree leading coefficients turning points and end behavior we saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient can help you make predictions about the number of turning points and the end behavior as well as vice versa this video is about exponential functions and their graphs an exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x where a and b are any real numbers as long as a is not 0 and b is positive it's important to notice that for an exponential function the variable x is in the exponent this is different from many other functions we've seen for example a quadratic function like f of x equals 3x squared has the variable in the base so it's not an exponential function for exponential functions f of x equals a times b to the x we require that a is not equal to zero because otherwise we would have f of x equals zero times b to the x which just means that f of x equals zero and this is called a constant function not an exponential function because f x is always equal to zero in an exponential function we require that b is bigger than zero because otherwise for example if b is equal to negative 1 say we'd have f of x equals a times negative 1 to the x now this would make sense for a lot of values of x but if we tried to do something like f of onehalf with our b's negative one that would be the same thing as a times the square root of negative one which is not a real number we'd get the same problem for other values of b if the values of b were negative and if we tried b equals zero we'd get a kind of ridiculous thing a times zero to the x which again is always zero so that wouldn't count as an exponential either so we can't use any negative bases and we can't use zero bases if we want an exponential function the number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value and the number b is called the base the phrase initial value comes from the fact that if we plug in x equals zero we get a times b to the 0 well anything to the 0 is just 1 so this is equal to a in other words f of 0 equals a so if we think of starting out when x equals 0 we get the y value of a that's why it's called the initial value let's start out with this example where y equals a times b to the x an exponential function and we've set a equal to one and b equals a two notice that the yintercept the value when x is zero is going to be one if i change my a value my initial value the yintercept changes the function is stretched out if i make the value of a go to 0 and then negative then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x axis let's go back to an a value of say 1 and see what happens when we change b right now the b value the base is two if i increase b my yintercept sticks at one but my graph becomes steeper and steeper if i put b back down close to 1 my graph becomes more flat at exactly 1 my graph is just a constant as b gets into fractional territory point eight point seven point six my graph starts to slope the other way it's decreasing now instead of increasing but notice that the yintercept still hasn't changed i can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one of course when b goes to negative territory my graph doesn't make any sense so a changes the yintercept and b changes the steepness of the graph so that it's and whether it's increasing for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one we'll summarize all these observations on the next slide we've seen that for an exponential function y equals a times b to the x the parameter or number a gives the yintercept the parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing specifically if b is greater than one the graph is increasing and if b is less than one the graph is decreasing the closer b is to the number one the flatter the graph so for example if i were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x and y equals 0.4 to the x they would both be decreasing graphs since the base for both of them is less than 1 but 0.25 is farther away from 1 and .4 is closer to 1 so 0.4 is going to be flatter and 0.25 is going to be more steep so in this picture this red graph would correspond to 0.25 to the x and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x for all these exponential functions whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing they all have a horizontal asymptote along the xaxis in other words at the line y equals zero the domain is always from negative infinity to infinity and the range is always from 0 to infinity because the range is always positive y values actually that's true if a is greater than 0. if a is less than 0 then our graph flips over the xaxis our domain stays the same but our range becomes negative infinity to zero the most famous exponential function is f of x equals e to the x this function's also sometimes written as f of x equals x of x the number e is euler's number it's approximately 2.7 this function has important applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems in this video we looked at exponential functions functions of the form a times b to the x where the variable is in the exponent we saw that they all have the same general shape either increasing like this or decreasing like this unless a is negative in which case they flip over the xaxis they all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the xaxis in this video we'll use exponential functions to model realworld examples let's suppose you're hired for a job the starting salary is forty thousand dollars with a guaranteed annual raise of three percent each year how much will your salary be after one year two years five years and in general after t years let me chart out the information the left column will be the number of years since you're hired and the right column will be your salary when you start work that's zero years after you're hired your salary will be forty thousand dollars after one year you'll have gotten a three percent raise so your salary will be the original forty thousand plus three percent of forty thousand point 0.03 times 40 000. i can think of this first number as one times 40 000 and i can factor out the 40 000 from both terms to get forty thousand times one plus zero point zero three let me rewrite this as forty thousand times one point oh three this is your original salary multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03 after two years you'll get a three percent raise from your previous year salary your previous year's salary was 40 000 times 1.03 but you'll add 3 of that again i can think of the first number as 1 times 40 000 times 1.03 and i can factor out the common factor of 40 000 times 1.03 from both terms to get 40 000 times 1.03 times 1 plus 0.03 let me rewrite that as 40 000 times 1.03 times 1.03 or 40 000 times 1.03 squared we can think of this as your last year's salary multiplied by the same growth factor of 1.03 after three years a similar computation will give you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of 1.03 that can be written as 40 000 times 1.03 cubed and in general if you're noticing the pattern after t years your salary should be 40 000 times 1.03 to the t power in other words your salary after t years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor of 1.03 taken to the t power let me write this as a formula s of t where s of t is your salary is equal to 40 000 times 1.03 to the t this is an exponential function that is a function of the form a times b to the t where your initial value a is 40 000 and your base b is 1.03 notice that your base is the amount that your salary gets multiplied by each year given this formula we can easily figure out what your salary will be after for example five years by plugging in five for t i worked that out on my calculator to be forty six thousand three hundred seventy dollars and ninety six cents to the nearest cent exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth the united nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was 6.79 billion growing at a rate of 1.1 percent per year assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will continue to stay the same we'll write an equation for the population at t years after the year 2010. 1.1 percent written as a decimal is 0.011 so if we work out a chart as before we see that after zero years since 2010 we have our initial population 6.79 billion after one year we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1 percent of it that is 0.011 times 6.79 this works out to 6.79 times 1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011 here we have our initial population of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011 that's how much the population got multiplied by in one year as before we can work out that after two years our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice and after t years it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the t power so our function that models population is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the t here t represents time in years since 2010. just for fun i'll plug in t equals 40. that's 40 years since 2010 so that's the year 2050 and i get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power which works out to 10.5 billion that's the prediction based on this exponential model the previous two examples were examples of exponential growth this last example is an example of exponential decay the drug seroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the body at a rate of 11 percent per hour if 400 milligrams are given how much remains in the body 24 hours later i'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours since the dose was given and the right column will be the number of milligrams of seroquel still in the body zero hours after the dose is given we have the full 400 milligrams in the body one hour later we have the 400 milligrams minus 11 percent of it that's minus 0.11 times 400. if i factor out the 400 from both terms i get 400 times 1 minus 0.11 or 400 times 0.89 the 400 represents the initial amount the 0.89 i'll call the growth factor even though in this case the quantity is decreasing not growing so really it's kind of a shrink factor let's see what happens after two hours now i'll have 400 times 0.89 my previous amount it'll again get multiplied by 0.89 so that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared and in general after t hours i'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89 raised to the t power since each hour the amount of seroquel gets multiplied by .89 that number less than one i'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400 times 0.89 to the t where f of t represents the number of milligrams of seroquel in the body and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given to find out how much is in the body after 24 hours i just plug in 24 for t this works out to about 24.4 milligrams i hope you noticed the common form for the functions used to model all three of these examples the functions were always in the form f of t equals a times b to the t where a represented the initial amount and b represented the growth factor to find the growth factor b we started with the percent increase or decrease we wrote it as a decimal and then we either added it or subtracted it from one depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing let me show you that as a couple examples in the first example we had a percent increase of 3 percent on the raise as a decimal i'll call this r this was 0.03 and to get the growth factor we added that to 1 to get 1.03 in the world population example we had a 1.1 percent increase we wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1 to get 1.011 in the drug example we had a decrease of 11 we wrote that as a decimal and we subtracted the 0.11 from 1 to get 0.89 in fact you can always write the growth factor b as one plus the percent change written as a decimal if you're careful to make that percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the quantity is increasing since here 1 plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89 which is less than 1. as a good check remember that if your quantity is increasing the base b should be bigger than 1 and if the quantity is decreasing then b should be less than 1. exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts and loans with compound interest as we'll see in another video this video is about interpreting exponential functions an antique car is worth fifty thousand dollars now and its value increases by seven percent each year let's write an equation to model its value x years from now after one year its value is the fifty thousand plus 0.07 times the 50 000. that's because its value has grown by seven percent or 0.07 times 50 000. this can be written as 50 000 times 1 plus 0.07 notice that adding 7 percent to the original value is the same as multiplying the original value by 1 plus .07 or by 1.07 after two years the value will be 50 000 times 1 plus 0.07 squared or 50 000 times 1.07 squared that's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07 and in general after x years v of x the antique car's value will be 50 000 times 1.07 to the x that's because the original value of 50 000 gets multiplied by 1.07 x times one time for each year if we dissect this equation we see that the number of 50 000 comes from the original value of the car the 1.07 which i call the growth factor comes from 1 plus 0.707 the 0.07 being the the percent increase written as a decimal so the form of this equation is an exponential equation v of x equals a times b to the x where a is the initial value and b is the growth vector but we could also write this as a times 1 plus r to the x where a is still the initial value but r is the percent increase written as a decimal this same equation will come up in the next example here my toyota prius is worth only 3000 now and its value is decreasing by five percent each year so after one year its value will be three thousand minus zero point zero five times three thousand that is three thousand times one minus zero point zero five i can also write that as three thousand times zero point nine five decreasing the value by five percent is like multiplying the value by one minus 0.05 or by 0.95 after two years the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again so the value will be 3000 times 0.95 squared and after x years the value will be 3000 times 0.95 to the x so my equation for the value is 3000 times 0.95 to the x this is again an equation of the form v of x equals a times b to the x where here a is 3000 the initial value and b is 0.95 i'll still call that the growth factor even though we're actually declining in value not growing now remember where this .95 came from it came from taking 1 and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5 percent decrease in value so i can again write my equation in the form a times well this time times 1 minus r to the x where r is our .05 that's our percent decrease written as a decimal please take a moment to study this equation and the previous one these say that when you have an exponential function the number here is the initial value if it's written in this form b is your growth factor but you can think of b as being either one minus r where r is the percent decrease or one plus r where r is the percent increase in this example we're given a function f of x to model the number of bacteria in a petri dish x hours after 12 o'clock noon we want to know what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria is increasing every hour we can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing and not decreasing because the base of the exponential function 1.45 is bigger than 1. notice that our equation f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x or we can think of it as a times 1 plus r to the x here a is 12 b is 1.45 and r is 0.45 based on this familiar form we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12. 12 000 since those are our units and this value 1.45 is our growth factor what the number of bacteria is multiplied by each hour while r the 0.45 is the the the rate of increase in other words a 45 percent increase each hour so our answers to the questions are 12 000 and 45 percent in this example the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function where x is the number of years since 2015. notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing because the base of our exponential function 0.78 is less than 1. so if we recognize the form of our exponential function a times b to the x or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x where a is our initial value and r is our percent decrease written as a decimal our initial value is three thousand so that's the number of salamanders 0 years after 2015. our growth factor b is 0.78 but if i write that as 1 minus r i see that r has to be 1 minus 0.78 or 0.22 in other words our population is decreasing by 22 percent each year in this video we saw that exponential functions can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x where a is the initial value and b is the growth factor we also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r to the x when the amount is increasing and as a times 1 minus r to the x when the amount is decreasing in this format r is the percent increase or the percent decrease written as a decimal so a 15 increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b of 1.15 whereas a 12 decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.7 sorry 0.88 these observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions for example here we have an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase and here we have an initial value of 50 and a 40 percent decrease exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts suppose you invest two hundred dollars in a bank account that earns three percent interest every year if you make no deposits or withdrawals how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year so after one year the amount will be 200 times 1.03 after two years 200 times 1.03 squared and and after t years 200 times 1.03 to the t power so the function modeling the amount of money i'll call it p of t is given by 200 times 1.03 to the t more generally if you invest a dollars at an annual interest rate of r for t years in the end you'll have p of t equals a times 1 plus r to the t here r needs to be written as a decimal so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate going back to our specific example after 10 years the amount of money is going to be p of 10 which is 200 times 1.03 to the 10 which works out to 268 dollars and 78 cents to the nearest cent in this problem we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year but in the next few examples we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently twice a year or every month for example let's deposit three hundred dollars in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual interest compounded semiannually this means two times a year or every six months a 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting 4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded that is every 6 months that's 2.25 percent interest every half a year note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.0225 as a decimal so every time we earn interest our money gets multiplied by 1.0225 let me make a chart of what happens after zero years which is also zero half years we have our original three hundred dollars after half a year that's one half year our money gets earns interest one time so we multiply the 300 by 1.08 after one year that's two half years our money earns interest two times so we multiply 300 by 1.0225 squared continuing this way after 1.5 years that's three half years we have 300 times 1.0225 cubed and after two years or four half years we have 300 times 1.0225 to the fourth in general after t years which is 2t half years our money will grow to 300 times 1.02 to the 2t power because we've compounded interest 2t times our formula for our amount of money is p of t equals 300 times 1.02 to the 2t where t is the number of years to finish the problem after 7 years we'll have p of 7 which is 300 times 1.0225 to the 2 times 7 or 14 power and that works out to 409 dollars and 65 cents to the nearest cent in this next example we're gonna take out a loan for a thousand two hundred dollars at an annual interest rate of six percent compounded monthly although loans and bank accounts might feel different they're mathematically the same it's like from the bank's point of view they're investing money in you and getting interest on their money from you so we can work them out with the same kind of math six percent annual interest rate compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year so each time you compound interest you're just going to get 6 over twelve percent interest that's point five percent interest and as a decimal that's zero point zero zero five let's chart out again what happens times zero of course you'll have the original loan amount of 1200 after one year that's 12 months your loan has had interest headed to it 12 times so it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th after 2 years that's 24 months it's had interest added to it 24 times so it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power similarly after 3 years or 36 months your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power and in general after t years that's 12 t months so the interest will be compounded 12 t times and so we have to raise the 1.005 to the 12 t power this gives us the general formula for the money owed is p of t equals 1 200 times 1.005 to the 12 t where t is the number of years in particular after three years we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005 to the 12 times 3 or 36 power which works out to 1436 dollars and two cents to the nearest cent these last two problems follow a general pattern if a is the initial amount of the loan or bank account and r is the annual interest rate compounded n times per year then our formula for the amount of money is going to be a times 1 plus r over n to the nt this formula exactly matches what we did in this problem first we took the interest rate r which was six percent and divided it by the number of compounding periods each year 12. we wrote that as a decimal and added one to it that's where we got the 1.005 from we raise this to not to the number of years but to 12 times the number of years that's the number of compounding periods per year times the number of years and we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money which was 1 200. this formula for compound interest is a good one to memorize but it's also important to be able to reason your way through it like we did in this chart there's one more type of compound interest and that's interest compounded continuously you can think of continuous compounding as the limit of compounding more and more frequently 10 times a year 100 times a year a thousand times a year a million times a year in the limit you get continuous compounding the formula for continuous compounding is p of t equals a times e to the rt where p of t is the amount of money t is the time in years a is the initial amount of money and r is the annual interest rate written as a decimal so 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5 percent annual interest rate e represents the famous constant euler's constant which is about 2.718 so in this problem we have p of t is 4 000 times e to the 0.025 t and after 5 years we'll have p of 5 which is 4 000 times e to the 0.025 times 5 which works out to 4532.59 to the nearest cent to summarize if r represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal that is 2 would be 0.02 and t represents the number of years and a represents the initial amount of money than for just simple annual interest compounded once a year our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r to the t for compound interest compounded n times per year our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r over n to the nt and for compound interest compounded continuously we get p of t is a times e to the rt in this video we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems simple annual interest interest compounded end times per year and continuously compounded interest this video introduces logarithms logarithms are a way of writing exponents the expression log base a of b equals c means that a to the c equals b in other words log base a of b is the exponent that you raise a to to get b the number a is called the base of the logarithm it's also called the base when we write it in this exponential form some students find it helpful to remember this relationship log base a of b equals c means a to the c equals b by drawing arrows a to the c equals b other students like to think of it in terms of asking a question log base a of b asks what power do you raise a to in order to get b let's look at some examples log base 2 of 8 is 3 because 2 to the 3 equals 8. in general log base 2 of y is asking you the question what power do you have to raise 2 to to get y so for example log base 2 of 16 is 4 because it's asking you the question 2 to what power equals 16 and the answer is 4. please pause the video and try some of these other examples log base 2 of 2 is asking what power do you raise 2 to to get 2 and the answer is 1. 2 to the 1 equals 2. log base 2 of onehalf is asking 2 to what power gives you onehalf well to get onehalf you need to raise 2 to a negative power so that would be 2 to the negative 1. so the answer is negative 1. log base 2 of 1 8 means what power do we raise 2 to in order to get 1 8. again since 1 8 is 1 over 2 cubed we have to raise 2 to the negative 3 power to get 1 over 2 cubed so our exponent is negative 3 and that's our answer to our log expression finally log base 2 of 1 is asking 2 to what power equals 1. well anything raised to the zero power gives us one so this log expression evaluates to zero notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our logarithm expressions please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to to work out log base 10 of a million notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power now we're asking the question what power do we raise 10 to to get a million so that is what power do we raise 10 to to get 10 to the sixth well of course the answer is going to be 6. similarly since 0.001 is 10 to the minus 3 this log expression is the same thing as asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus 3. well what power do you have to raise 10 to to get 10 to the minus 3 of course the answer is negative 3. log base 10 of 0 is asking what power do we raise 10 to to get zero well if you think about it there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers raising 10 to a negative exponent is like 1 over 10 to a power so that's giving us tiny fractions but they're still positive numbers we're never going to get zero even if we raise 10 to the zero power we'll just get one so there's no way to get 0 and the log base 10 of 0 does not exist if you try it on your calculator using the log base 10 button you'll get an error message same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100 we're asking 10 to what power equals negative 100 and there's no exponent that will work and more generally it's possible to take the log of numbers that are greater than zero but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero in other words the domain of the function log base a of x no matter what base you're using for a the domain is going to be all positive numbers a few notes on notation when you see ln of x that's called natural log and it means the log base e of x where e is that famous number that's about 2.718 when you see log of x with no base at all by convention that means log base 10 of x and it's called the common log most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log and for common log let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them log base 3 of 1 9 is negative 2 can be rewritten as the expression 3 to the negative 2 equals 1 9. log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. so that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394 equals 13. finally in this last expression ln means natural log or log base e so i can rewrite this equation as log base e of 1 over e equals negative one well that means the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e which is true now let's go the opposite direction we'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs remember that log base a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b the base stays the same in both expressions so for this example the base of 3 in the exponential equation is going to be the same as the base in our log now i just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log and what goes on the other side of the equal sign remember that the answer to a log is an exponent so the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation in other words u and i'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log this works because log base 3 of 9.78 equals u means the same thing as 3 to the u equals 9.78 which is just what we started with in the second example the base of my exponential equation is e so the base of my log is going to be e the answer to my log is an exponent in this case the exponent 3x plus 7. and the other expression the 4 minus y becomes my argument of my log let me check log base e of 4 minus y equals 3x plus 7 means e to the 3x plus 7 equals 4 minus y which is just what i started with i can also rewrite log base e as natural log this video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b so log base a of b is asking the question what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b in this video we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their domains for this first example let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points the function we're working with is y equals log base 2 of x i'll make a chart of x and y values since we're working this out by hand i want to pick x values for which it's easy to compute log base 2 of x so i'll start out with the x value of 1 because log base 2 of 1 is 0 log base anything of 1 is 0. 2 is another x value that's easy to compute log base 2 of 2 that's asking what power do i raise 2 to to get 2 well and the answer is 1. other powers of 2 are easy to work with so for example log base 2 of 4 that's saying what power do i raise 2 to get 4 so the answer is 2 similarly log base 2 of 8 is 3 and log base 2 of 16 is 4. let me also work with some fractional values for x if x is onehalf then log base 2 of onehalf that's saying what power do i raise 2 to to get 1 half well that needs a power of negative 1. it's also easy to compute by hand the log base 2 of 1 4 and 1 8. log base 2 of 1 4 is negative 2 since 2 to the negative 2 is 1 4 and similarly log base 2 of 1 8 is negative 3. i'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes please pause the video and take a moment to plot these points let's see i have the point 1 0 that's here 2 1 that's here 4 2 that is here and then 8 3 which is here and the fractional x values one half goes with negative 1 and 1 4 with negative 2 1 8 with negative 3. and if i connect the dots i get a graph that looks something like this if i had smaller and smaller fractions i would keep getting more and more negative answers when i took log base two of them so my graph is getting more and more negative my y values are getting more and more negative as x is getting close to zero now i didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with negative x values and i didn't put any negative x values in my chart that omission is is no accident because if you try to take the log base 2 or base anything of a negative number like say negative 4 or something there's no answer this doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise 2 2 to get a negative number so there are no points on the graph for negative x values and similarly there are no points on the graph where x is 0 because you can't take log base 2 of 0 there's no power you can raise 2 to to get 0. i want to observe some key features of this graph first of all the domain is x values greater than zero in interval notation i can write that as a round bracket because i don't want to include 0 to infinity the range is going to be the y values well they go all the way down into the far reach of the negative numbers and the graph gradually increases y value is getting bigger and bigger so the range is actually all real numbers we're in interval notation negative infinity to infinity finally i want to point out that this graph has a vertical asymptote at the yaxis that is at the line x equals zero i'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line a vertical asymptote is a line that our function's graph gets closer and closer to so this is the graph of y equals log base 2 of x but if i wanted to graph say y equals log base 10 of x it would look very similar it would still have a domain of x values greater than zero a range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote at the y axis it would still go through the point 1 0 but it would go through the point 10 1 instead because log base 10 of 10 is 1. it would look pretty much the same just a lot flatter over here but even though it doesn't look like it with the way i've drawn it it still gradually goes up to and towards infinity in fact the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger than one looks pretty much the same and has these same three properties now that we know what the basic log graph looks like we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting points here we have the graph of natural log of x plus 5. and again i'm just going to draw a rough graph if i did want to do a more accurate graph i probably would want to plot some points but i know that roughly a log graph if it was just like y equals ln of x that would look something like this and it would go through the point one zero with a vertical asymptote along the yaxis now if i want to graph ln of x plus 5 that just shifts our graph up by 5 units it'll still have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical line shifted up by 5 units is still a vertical line but instead of going through 1 0 it'll go through the point 1 5. so i'll draw a rough sketch here let's compare our starting function y equals ln x and the transformed version y equals lnx plus 5 in terms of the domain the range and the vertical asymptote our original function y equals ln x had a domain of 0 to infinity since adding 5 on the outside affects the y values and the domain is the x values this transformation doesn't change the domain so the domain is still from 0 to infinity now the range of our original y equals ln x was from negative infinity to infinity shifting up by 5 does affect the y values and the range is talking about the y values but since the original range was all real numbers if you add five to all instead of all real numbers you still get the set of all real numbers so in this case the range doesn't change either and finally we already saw that the original vertical asymptote of the yaxis x equals zero when we shift that up by five units it's still the vertical line x equals zero in this next example we're starting with a log base 10 function and since the plus 2 is on the inside that means we shift that graph left by 2. so i'll draw our basic log function here's our basic log function so i'll think of that as y equals log of x going through the point one zero here's its vertical asymptote now i need to shift everything left by two so my vertical asymptote shifts left and now it's at the line x equals negative two instead of at x equals zero and my graph well let's see my point one zero gets shifted to let's see negative 1 0 since i'm subtracting 2 from the x's and here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here we're talking about domains the original had a domain of from 0 to infinity but now i've shifted that left so i've subtracted 2 from all my x values and here's my new domain which i can also verify just by looking at the picture my range was originally from negative infinity to infinity well shifting left only affects the x value so it doesn't even affect the range so my range is still negative infinity to infinity my vertical asymptote was originally at x equals 0 and since i subtract 2 from all my x values that shifts it to x equals negative 2. in this last problem i'm not going to worry about drawing this graph i'll just use algebra to compute its domain so let's think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things well you can't take the log of a negative number or zero so whatever's inside the argument of the log function whatever's being fed into log had better be greater than zero so i'll write that down we need 2 minus 3x to be greater than zero now it's a matter of solving an inequality 2 has got to be greater than 3x so 2 3 is greater than x in other words x has to be less than twothirds so our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to twothirds not including twothirds it's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function it looks something like this goes through the point 1 0 and has a vertical asymptote on the y axis also if you remember that you can't take the log of a negative number or zero then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions whatever's inside the log function you set that greater than zero and solve this video is about combining functions by adding them subtracting them multiplying them and dividing them suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared one way to combine them is by adding them together this notation f plus g of x means the function defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x so for our functions that means we take x plus 1 and add x squared i can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus 1. so so f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus 1. and if i wanted to evaluate f plus g on the number two that would be two squared plus two plus one or seven similarly the notation f minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and subtracting g of x so that would be x plus 1 minus x squared and if i wanted to take f minus g evaluated at 1 that would be 1 plus 1 minus 1 squared or 1. the notation f dot g of x which is sometimes also written just as f g of x that means we take f of x times g of x in other words x plus 1 times x squared which could be simplified as x cubed plus x squared the notation f divided by g of x means i take f of x and divide it by g of x so that would be x plus 1 divided by x squared in this figure the blue graph represents h of x and the red graph represents the function p of x we're asked to find h minus p of zero we don't have any equations to work with but that's okay we know that for any x h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x so for x equals 0 h minus p of 0 is going to be h of 0 minus p of 0. using the graph we can find h of 0 by finding the value of 0 on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function h of x so that's about 1.8 now p of zero we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function p of x and that's a y value of 1. 1.8 minus 1 is 0.8 so that's our approximate value for h minus p of 0. if we want to find p times h of negative 3 again we can rewrite that as p of negative 3 times h of negative 3. and using the graphs we see that for an x value of negative 3 the y value for p is 2 and the x value of negative 3 corresponds to a y value of negative 2 for h 2 times negative 2 is negative 4 so that's our value for p times h of negative 3. in this video we saw how to add two functions subtract two functions multiply two functions and divide two functions in the following way when you compose two functions you apply the first function and then you apply the second function to the output of the first function for example the first function might compute population size from time in years so its input would be time in years since a certain date its output would be number of people in the population the second function g might compute healthcare costs as a function of population size so it will take population size as input and its output will be healthcare costs if you put these functions together that is compose them then you'll go all the way from time in years to health care costs this is your composition g composed with f the composition of two functions written g with a little circle f of x is defined as follows g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x we can think of it schematically in this diagram f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number g of f x our composition of functions g composed with f is the function that goes all the way from x to g of f x let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values if we want to find g composed with f of 4 by definition this means g of f 4. to evaluate this expression we always work from the inside out so we start with the x value of 4 and we find f of 4 using the table of values for f of x when x equals 4 f of x is 7. so we can replace f of 4 with the number 7. now we need to evaluate g of 7 7 becomes our new x value in our table of values for g the x value of 7 corresponds to the g of x value of of 10 so g of 7 is equal to 10. we found that g composed with f of 4 is equal to 10. if instead we want to find f composed with g of 4 well we can rewrite that as f of g of 4 and again work from the inside out now we're trying to find g of 4 so 4 is our x value and we use our table of values for g to see that g of 4 is 1. so we replace g of 4 by 1 and now we need to evaluate f of 1. using our table for f values f of 1 is 8. notice that when we've computed g of f of 4 we got a different answer then we computed f of g of 4. and in general g composed with f is not the same thing as f composed with g please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples we can replace f composed with f of 2 by the equivalent expression f of f of 2 working from the inside out we know that f of 2 is 3 and f of 3 is 6. if we want to find f composed with g of 6 rewrite that as f of g of 6 using the table for g g of 6 is 8 but f of 8 8 is not on the table as an x value for the for the f function and so there is no f of 8. this does not exist we can say that 6 is not in the domain for f composed with g even though it was in the domain of g we couldn't follow all the way through and get a value for f composed with g of 6. next let's turn our attention to the composition of functions that are given by equations p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative 2x we want to find q composed with p of 1. as usual i can rewrite this as q of p of 1 and work from the inside out p of 1 is one squared plus one so that's two so this is the same thing as q of two but q of two is negative two times two or negative four so this evaluates to negative in this next example we want to find q composed of p of some arbitrary x i'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out well p of x we know the formula for that that's x squared plus x so i can replace my p of x with that expression now i'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x well q of anything is negative 2 times that thing so q of x squared plus x is going to be negative 2 times the quantity x squared plus x what i've done is i've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x where i saw the x in this formula for q of x it's important to use the parentheses here so that we'll be multiplying negative 2 by the whole expression and not just by the first piece i can simplify this a bit as negative 2x squared minus 2x and that's my expression for q composed with p of x notice that if i wanted to compute q compose with p of 1 which i already did in the first problem i could just use this expression now negative 2 times 1 squared minus 2 and i get negative 4 just like i did before let's try another one let's try p composed with q of x first i read write this p of q of x working from the inside out i can replace q of x with negative 2x so i need to compute p of negative 2x here's my formula for p to compute p of this expression i need to plug in this expression everywhere i see an x in the formula for p so that means negative 2x squared plus negative 2x again being careful to use parentheses to make sure i plug in the entire expression in for x let me simplify this is 4x squared minus 2x notice that i got different expressions for q of p of x and for p of q of x once again we see that q composed with p is not necessarily equal to p composed with q please pause the video and try this last example yourself rewriting and working from the inside out we can replace p of x with its expression x squared plus x and then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x that means we plug in x squared plus x everywhere we see an x in this formula so that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus x squared plus x once again i can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus 2x squared plus x in this last set of examples we're asked to go backwards we're given a formula for a function of h of x but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions f and g let's think for a minute which of these two functions gets applied first f composed with g of x let's see that means f of g of x and since we evaluate these expressions from the inside out we must be applying g first and then f in order to figure out what what f and g could be i like to draw a box around some thing inside my expression for h so i'm going to draw a box around x squared plus 7. then whatever's inside the box that'll be my function g of x the first function that gets applied whatever happens to the box in this case taking the square root sign that becomes my outside function my second function f so here we're going to say g of x is equal to x squared plus 7 and f of x is equal to the square root of x let's just check and make sure that this works so i need to check that when i take the composition f composed with g i need to get the same thing as my original h so let's see if i do f composed with g of x well by definition that's f of g of x working from the inside out i can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven so i need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven that means i plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f so that becomes the square root of x squared plus 7. tada it works because it matches my original equation so we found a correct answer a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions but i do want to point out this is not the only correct answer i'll write down my formula for h of x again and this time i'll put the box in a different place i'll just box the x squared if i did that then my inside function my first function g of x would be x squared and my second function is what happens to the box so my f of x is what happens to the box and the box gets added 7 to it and taking the square root so in other words f of x is going to be the square root of x plus 7. again i can check that this works if i do f compose with g of x that's f of g of x so now g of x is x squared so i'm taking f of x squared when i plug in x squared for x i do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven so this is it alternative correct solution in this video we learned to evaluate the composition of functions by rewriting it and working from the inside out we also learned to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the composition let that be the inside of the box and the second function applied in the composition b whatever happens to the box the inverse of a function undoes what the function does so the inverse of tying your shoes would be to untie them and the inverse of the function that adds 2 to a number would be the function that subtracts 2 from a number this video introduces inverses and their properties suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart in other words f of 2 is 3 f of 3 is 5 f of 4 is 6 and f of 5 is 1. the inverse function for f written f superscript negative 1 x undoes what f does since f takes 2 to 3 f inverse takes 3 back to 2. so we write this f superscript negative 1 of 3 is 2. similarly since f takes 3 to 5 f inverse takes 5 to 3. and since f takes 4 to 6 f inverse of 6 is 4 and since f takes 5 to 1 f inverse of 1 is 5. i'll use these numbers to fill in the chart notice that the chart of values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely related they share the same numbers but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values for f inverse of x and the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x that leads us to the first key fact inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x i'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue next i'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph how are the blue points related to the red points you might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x so our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x this makes sense because inverses reverse the rules of y and x in this same example let's compute f inverse of f of 2. this open circle means composition in other words we're computing f inverse of f of 2. we compute this from the inside out so that's f inverse of 3 since f of 2 is 3 and f inverse of 3 we see is 2. similarly we can compute f of f inverse of 3 and that means we take f of f inverse of 3. since f inverse of 3 is 2 that's the same thing as computing f of 2 which is 3. please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions you should have found that in every case if you take f inverse of f of a number you get back to the very same number you started with and similarly if you take f of f inverse of any number you get back to the same number you started with so in general f inverse of f of x is equal to x and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x this is the mathematical way of saying that f and f inverse undo each other let's look at a different example suppose that f of x is x cubed pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be remember f inverse undoes the work that f does you might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function and we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x that's f of the cube root of function which means the cube root function cubed which gets us back to x similarly if we compute f inverse of f of x that's the cube root of x cubed and we get back to x again so the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing function when we compose the two functions we get back to the number that we started with it'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking one method uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles of y and x so if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals 5 minus x over 3x we can write it as y equals 5 minus x over 3x reverse the rules of y and x to get x equals 5 minus y over 3y and then solve for y to solve for y let's multiply both sides by 3y bring all terms with y's in them to the left side and all terms without y's in them to the right side factor out the y and divide to isolate y this gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational functions but they're not the reciprocals of each other and in general f inverse of x is not usually equal to 1 over f of x this can be confusing because when we write 2 to the minus 1 that does mean 1 over 2 but f to the minus 1 of x means the inverse function and not the reciprocal it's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions that is for any function you might encounter is there always a function that is its inverse in fact the answer is no see if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function the word function here is key remember that a function is a relationship between x values and y values such that for each x value in the domain there's only one corresponding y value one example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x squared to see that the inverse of this function is not a function note that for the x squared function the number two and the number negative two both go to the number four so if i had an inverse it would have to send four to both two and negative two the inverse would not be a function it might be easier to understand the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared recall that inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x but when i flip the green graph over the line y equals x i get this red graph this red graph is not the graph of a function because it violates the vertical line test the reason it violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal line test and has two x values with the same y value in general a function f has an inverse function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test i.e every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test in other words which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function you may have found that graphs a and b violate the horizontal line test so their functions would not have inverse functions but graph c and d satisfy the horizontal line test so these graphs represent functions that do have inverses functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called onetoone functions equivalently a function is one to one if for any two different x values x one and x two the y values f of x one and f of x two are different numbers sometimes as i said f is one to one if whenever f of x one is equal to f of x two then x one has to equal x two as our last example let's try to find p inverse of x where p of x is the square root of x minus 2 drawn here if we graph p inverse on the same axis as p of x we get the following graph simply by flipping over the line y equals x if we try to solve the problem algebraically we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2 reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2. now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2 that would look like a parabola it would look like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side but we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm we can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal to zero this corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x y was only greater than or equal to zero looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to zero since we can't take the square root of a negative number this corresponds to x values being greater than or equal to two or in interval notation the interval from 2 to infinity the range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater than or equal to 0 or the interval from 0 to infinity similarly based on the graph we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to 0 the interval from 0 to infinity and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to 2 or the interval from 2 to infinity if you look closely at these domains and ranges you'll notice that the domain of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p inverse this makes sense because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x the domain of f inverse of x is the x values for f inverse which corresponds to the y values or the range of f the range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse which correspond to the x values or the domain of f in this video we discussed five key properties of inverse functions inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x the graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x when we compose f with f inverse we get the identity function y equals x and similarly when we compose f inverse with f that brings x to x in other words f and f inverse undo each other the function f of x has an inverse function if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test and finally the domain of f is the range of f inverse and the range of f is the domain of f inverse these properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions
