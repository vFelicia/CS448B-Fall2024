hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on the introduction to network devices part one today we're going to be talking about layer one devices layer 2 devices and then we're going to conclude with layer three devices there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and dive in into this session of course I'm going to begin with layer one devices well before I start talking about the layer one devices we need to talk about the Open System interconnection model The OSI model it was developed as a way to help disparate Computing systems to communicate with each other the OSI reference model has seven layers layer one is the physical layer Layer Two two is data link Layer Three is Network layer four is transport layer five is session layer six is presentation and layer seven is application we're going to be discussing the bottom three layers layers one two and three today now most devices do function at more than one layer of the OSI reference model but when it comes time to determining where they fit into the model you must first determine the highest level at which they operate because that's where they fit into the OSI model to do that you must know what they do and how that relates to the OSI model and with that let's talk about analog modems the word modem is actually derived from contraction of modulator demodulator modems were developed to take a digital signal coming from a digital node and convert it to an analog signal modulating the signal and placing it on a wire in return it would accept an analog signal from The Wire and convert it demodulating the signal back to a digital signal that the node can understand modems were developed to create a connection between Network segments via the public switched telephone network using the plain old telephone system now modem provide for a single connection to a network and they're only concerned about the wire and the wire resides on the physical layer layer one of the OSI model it doesn't care where the signal comes from it just does its job then there's the Hub a hub functions as a concentrator or repeater in that it doesn't care where the signal comes from or where the signal is going kind of like the modem it takes an electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of its other ports a hub may have just a few ports or it may have many ports and for a variety of reasons The Hub is not very common anymore in the modern Network so now let's move on to Layer Two devices the first layer 2 device that we're going to talk about is the switch a switch you I izes an application specific integrated circuit chip an Asic chip the Asic chip has specific programming that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the network and which ports it is connected to Via that devic's layer 2 Mac address that's what makes a switch a layer 2 device a switch may have just a few ports or it may have Min ports kind of like the Hub and although a switch is smarter than a hub it can still be very simple or it can be highly complex and programmable a switch can only communicate with local network devices another layer 2 device that we need to talk about are wireless access points the WAP a WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects or Bridges wireless network segments with wired Network segments the most common type of WAP Bridges an 802.11 wireless network segment with an 802.3 Ethernet Network segment just like a switch a wireless access point will only communicate with local network devices now let's move on to layer three devices and first up is the multilayer switch a multilayer switch provides normal layer 2 Network switching services but it will also provide layer three or higher OSI model Services the most common multilayer switch is a layer three switch it not only utilizes an Asic chip for switching but that Asic chip is also programmed to handle routing functions this allows the device to communicate and pass data to nonlocal network devices a multilayer switch is a highly programmable and complex Network device a multilayer switch may have just a few ports or it may have a lot of ports they're not very common in the small office home office Network because they're really really expensive you're more likely to find them in an Enterprise local area Network now let's move on to the router a router is the most common Network device for connecting different networks together utilizing the OSI models layer three logical Network information that's what makes a router a layer 3 device the router uses software programming for decision making as compared to the switch's use of an ASAC chip the router uses this programming to keep track of different networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks a router can communicate with both local and nonlocal network devices in most cases a router will have fewer ports than a switch now that concludes this session on the introduction to network devices part one we talked about layer one devices we talked about layer 2 devices and we concluded with a couple of layer three devices now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm pretty certain I'll do another one good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on introduction to network devices part two today we're going to discuss some security network devices and then we'll move on to some optimization and performance devices and with that let's go ahead and begin this session and we will Begin by talking about security devices first up is the firewall now a firewall can be placed on routers or hosts in that it can be software based or it can be its own device a firewall functions at multiple layers of the OSI model specifically at layers 2 3 4 and 7 a firewall can block packets from entering or leaving the network and it does this through one of two methods it can do it through stateless inspection in which the firewall will examine every packet that enters or leaves the networks against a set of rules once the packet matches a rule the rule is enforced and the specified action is taken or it may use State full inspection this is when a firewall will only examine the state of a connection between networks specifically when a connection is made from an internal Network to an external network the firewall will not examine any packets returning from the external connection it only cares about the state of the connection as a general rule external connections are not allowed to be initiated with the internal Network now firewalls are the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats you can consider the firewall to be the police force of the network then there is the intrusion detection system the IDS an IDs is a passive system designed to identify when a network breach or attack against the network is occurring they're usually designed to inform a network administrator when a breach or attack has occurred and it does this through log files text messages and or through email notifications an IDs cannot prevent or stop a breach or attack on on its own the IDS receives a copy of all traffic and evaluates it against a set of Standards the standards that it used may be signaturebased this is when it evaluates Network traffic for known malware or attack signatures or the standard may be anomaly based this is where it evaluates Network traffic for suspicious changes or it may be policy based this is where it evaluates networ traffic against a specific declared security policy an IDs may be deployed at the host level when it's deployed at the host level it's called a host based intrusion detection system or heads more potent than the intrusion detection system is the intrusion prevention system the IPS an IPS is an active system designed to stop a breach or attack from succeeding in damaging the network they're usually designed to perform an action or set of actions to stop the malicious activity they will also inform a network administrator through the use of log files SMS text messaging and or through email notification for an IPS to work all traffic on the network segment needs to flow through the IPS as it enters and leaves the network segment like the IDS all of the traffic is evaluated against a set of standards and they're the same standards that are used on the IDS the best placement on the network segment is between a router with a firewall hopefully and the destination Network segment that way all the traffic flows through the IPS ipss are programed programmed to make an active response to the situation they can block the offending IP address they can close down vulnerable interfaces they can terminate Network sessions they can redirect the attack plus there are more actions that an IPS can take the main thing is is that they are designed to be active to stop the breach or attack from succeeding and damaging your network let's move move on to the virtual private Network concentrator the VPN concentrator now this will allow for many secure VPN connections to a network the concentrator will provide proper tunneling and encryption depending upon the type of VPN connection that is allowed to the network most concentrators can function at multiple layers of the OSI model specifically they can operate at layer 2 layer three and layer 7 now outside of Internet transactions which use an SSL VPN connection at layer 7 most concentrators will function at the network layer or layer three of the OSI model providing IP SEC encryption through a secure tunnel now let's talk about optimization and performance devices we will begin by talking about the load balancer a load balancer may also be called a Content switch or content filter it's a network appliance that is used to load balance between multiple hosts that contain the same data this spreads out the workload for greater efficiency they're commonly used to distribute the requests or workload to a server Farm among the various ser servers in the farm helping to ensure that no single server gets overloaded with work requests then there's the proxy server a proxy server is an appliance that requests resources on behalf of a client machine it's often used to retrieve resources from outside untrusted networks on behalf of the requesting client it hides and protects that requesting client from the outside untrusted Network it can also be utilized to filter allowed content back into the trusted Network it can also increase Network performance by caching or saving commonly requested web pages now that concludes this session on the introduction to network devices part two we talked about some security devices that you may find on your network and we concluded with optimization and performance devices that may also be present now on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on networking services and applications part one today I'm going to be discussing the basics of the virtual private Network and then I'm going to move on to protocols used by virtual private networks now there's a whole lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about the basics of the virtual private Network a virtual private Network or VPN is used by remote hosts to access a private Network through an encrypted tunnel through a public network once the VPN connection is made the remote host is no longer considered remote it's actually seen by the private Network as being a local host there are many advantages to that but I'm not going to cover them right now even though the network traffic may pass through many different routes or systems it's seen by both ends as being a direct connection the use of the VPN can help to reduce networking costs for organizations and business business the cost reduction is partially achieved because the VPN doesn't require the use of a dedicated least line to create that direct connection there are several different types of vpns there is the sight to sight VPN which allows a remote sites Network to connect to the main sites Network and be seen as a local network segment VPN concentrators on both ends of the the VPN will manage that connection then there's the Remote Access VPN which is also called a host to site VPN it allows select remote users to connect to the local network a VPN concentrator on the local network will manage the connection coming in from the remote users the remote system making the connection uses special software called VPN client software to make that connection the third type of VPN is the host to host VPN which is often called an sslvpn it allows a secure connection between two systems without the use of VPN client software a VPN concentrator on the local network manages the connection the host seeking to connect uses a web browser that supports the correct encryption technology which is either either SSL or more likely TLS to make the connection to the VPN concentrator it's time to discuss some protocols used by the virtual private Network the big protocol for vpns is called Internet Protocol security IP SEC which isn't actually a protocol in itself but a whole set of protocols IPC works at layer three of the OSI model or above it's the most common Suite of protocols used to secure a VPN connection ipet can be used with the authentication header protocol or the ah protocol ah only offers authentication services but no encryption so it authenticates the user but there is no encryption of the session or ipset can be used with encapsulating security payload protocol or the ESP protocol ESP both authenticates and encrypts the packets it is the most popular method of securing a VPN connection both ah and ESP will operate in one of two modes the first mode is transparent mode that is between two devices as in a host to host VPN or they can be used in tunnel mode which is between two endpoints as in a sight tosite VPN IPC implements Internet Security Association and Key Management Isa Camp by default Isa Camp provides a method for transferring security key and authentication data between systems outside of the security key generating process it is a much more secure process then we have generic routing encapsulation gr GRE is a tunneling protocol that is capable of encaps capsulating a wide variety of other network layer protocols it's often used to create a sub tunnel within an IPC connection why is that well IPC will only transmit unicast packets that's onetoone communication in many cases there's a need to transmit multicast which is one to some communication or broadcast which is one to many communication packets across an ipset Connection by using gr we can get that accomplished then there's Point topoint tunneling protocol pptp this is an older VPN technology that supports dialup VPN connections on its own it lacked native security features so it wasn't very secure but Microsoft's implementation included additional security by adding GR e to pointtopoint tunneling protocol transport layer security is another common VPN protocol TLS is a cryptographic protocol used to create a secure encrypted connection between two in devices or applications it uses asymmetrical cryptography to authenticate endpoints and then negotiates a symmetrical security key which is to encrypt the session TLS has largely replaced its cousin secure socket layer protocol and TLS works at layer five and above of the OSI model its most common usage is in creating a secure encrypted internet session or sslvpn all modern web browsers support TLS now I just mentioned secure socket layer or SSL SSL is an older cryptographic protocol that is very similar to TLS the most common use is in Internet transactions why because all modern web browsers support SSL but due to issues with earlier versions of the protocol it has largely been replaced by TLS SSL version 3.3 has been developed to address the weaknesses of earlier versions but it may never again catch up to its cousin the TLs protocol now that concludes this session on networking services and applications part one I talked about the basics of the virtual private Network and then I talked about the protocols used by the VPN network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on networking services and applications part two today we're going to be discussing network access services and then we're going to move on to other services and applications as always there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session I will be begin with network access Services the first network access service that I'm going to discuss is actually a piece of Hardware the network interface controller or Nick it can also be called the network interface card the Nick is how a device connects to a network the network interface controller works at two layers of the OSI model at Layer Two which is the data link layer it provides the functional means of network communication by determining which networking protocols will be used as in a Nick that will provide ethernet communication or a Nick that will provide pointtopoint protocol it also provides the local network node address through its burned in physical media Access Control address at layer one the physical layer the network interface controller determines how the network data traffic will be converted a bit at a time into an electrical signal that can Traverse the network media being used I.E it provides the connection to the network most modern computers come with at least one builtin ethernet Nick routers and other network devices may use separate modules that can be inserted into the device to provide the proper network interface controller for the type of media they're connecting to and the networking protocols that are being used another network access service is radius remote authentication dialin user service radius is a remote access service that is used to authenticate remote users and Grant them access to authorized network resources it is a popular AAA protocol that's authentication authorization and accounting protocol it's used to help ensure that only authenticated end users are using the network resources they are authorized to use the accounting services of radius are very robust the only drawback to radius is only the requesters the end users password is encrypted everything else gets sent in the clear terminal Access Controller access control system Plus or Taca plus terminal Access Controller hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on DHCP in the network today we're going to be talking about static versus Dynamic IP addressing then we're going to move on to how DHCP works and then we will conclude with components and processes of DHCP and with that let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we begin by talking about static versus Dynamic IP addressing so how does a computer know what its IP configuration is well more than likely a computer received its IP configuration from a dynamic host configuration protoc call server not only did the server give the PC an IP address but it also told the PC where the default gateway was and more than likely how to find a DNS server a computer will receive its IP configuration in one of two ways either statically which means manually set or dynamically which means through a service like thcp static IP addresses assignment works fine for very small and stable networks but quickly becomes unwieldly and error prone as the network grows and more nodes come onto the network so let's talk a little bit more about static IP addressing the administrator assigns an IP number in subnet mask to each host in the network whether it be a PC router or some other piece of electronic equipment each networ network interface that is going to be available to connect to the network requires this information the administrator also assigns a default gateway location and DNS server location to each host in the network now these settings are required if access to outside networks is going to be allowed that would be through the default gateway and if humanfriendly naming conventions are going to be allowed and that way you can more easily find network resources and that would be through a DNS server now each time A Change Is made as in a new default gateway is established each IP configuration on each host must be updated that's why it becomes rather cumbersome and complicated as the network grows now with Dynamic IP addressing the administrator configures a DHCP server to handle the assignment process which actually automates the process and eases management the DHCP server listens on a specific port for IP information requests once it receives a request the DHCP server responds with the required information now let's move on to how DHCP works here is the typical DHCP process upon bootup a PC that is configured to request an IP config configuration sends a DHCP Discovery packet now the discovery packet is sent to the broadcast address 255.255.255.0 on UDP Port 67 the DHCP server is listening to that Port it's listening for that Discovery packet when the DHCP server receives the discovery packet it responds with an offer pack packet basically saying hey I'm here to help now the offer packet is sent back to the MAC address of the computer requesting help and it's sent on Port 68 once the computer receives that offer packet from the DHCP server if it's going to use that DHCP server it returns a request packet that means it's requesting the proper IP configuration from from that specific DHCP server once the DHCP server receives the request packet it sends back an acknowledgement packet now this acknowledgement packet contains all of the required IP configuration information once the PC receives the acknowledgement packet the PC changes its IP configuration to reflect the information that it received from the DHC P server and that's the typical DHCP process in a nutshell now let's talk about components and the process of DHCP we're going to begin by talking about the ports used now I already mentioned this once but I'm going to mention it again because you need to know this the PC sends its Discovery packet out on the broadcast address . 255 on Port 67 that's UDP Port 67 when the DHCP server responds it responds to the PC's Mac address media Access Control address on UDP Port 68 that's important to remember the PC uses UDP Port 67 the DHCP server responds on UDP Port 6 68 then there's the address scope the address scope is the IP address range that the administrator configures on the DHCP server it is the range of addresses that the DHCP server can hand out to individual nodes there's also what are called address reservations now these are administrator configured reserved IP addresses the administrator reserves specific IP addresses to be handed out to specific Mac addresses now these are used for devices that should always have the same IP address as in servers and routers if you didn't do that there is the possibility that your default gateways IP address might change now the reason we use address reservation is this allows the these addresses to be changed from a central location instead of having to log into each device and change the IP configuration separately now part of the DHCP process are what are called leases the DHCP server hands out that IP configuration information but it sets a time limit for how long that IP configuration is good this is called the lease so the parameters are are only good for a specified amount of time now the administrator can configure how long the leases are there are also options that the administrator can configure the first one that's pretty obvious is the default gateway location there's also the DNS server address and the administrator can configure more than one DNS server location an administrator can also Al configure an option for the PC to synchronize with a Time server so the administrator can configure a Time server address there are many more additional options but those are the big three that you should remember now when a PC boots up it does have a preferred IP address that would be the IP address that it had the last time it booted up now it can request that same i p configuration from the DHCP server now the administrator can configure the DHCP server to either honor that preference or to ignore it now under the right circumstances a DHCP server isn't required to reside on the local network segment now as a general rule broadcast Transmissions Cann not pass through a router but if there is not a DHCP server on the local network segment the router can be configured to be a DHCP relay when a DHCP relay also called an IP helper receives a discovery packet from a node it will forward that packet to the network segment on which the DHCP server resides this allows for there to be fewer configured DHCP servers in any given Network reducing the amount amount of Maintenance that an administrator needs to perform now that concludes this session on DHCP in the network we started with static versus Dynamic IP addressing and then we moved on to how DHCP works and we concluded with components and processes of DHCP now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait session on the introduction to the DNS service today we're going to be talking about DNS servers DNS records and we will conclude with a brief discussion on dynamic DNS and with that let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin this session with a talk about DNS servers now DNS is the process that Maps humanfriendly names as in www.google.com to their appropriate IP addresses without DNS we would have to memorize all of the IP addresses that we wished to visit now DNS stands for domain name system and it's very structured in nature if the local DNS server apparatus doesn't contain the needed record it sends the request up the DNS chain until a positive response is received back now this positive response gets passed back down to the original requestor now DNS does require that an fqdn fully qualified domain name is used in order for it to function properly now an fqdn is the www.google.com it's that naming convention right there the www is the specific service that's being requested the Google portion is the local domain that contains the specific service and the com is the top level that contains the the Google that contains the specific service that is an fqdn now that we've got that covered let's talk about the different levels of DNS servers first off there can be a local DNS server this is the server on the local network that contains the hosts file that maps all of the fqdn to their specific IP addresses in the local subdomain it may be present or it may not be present then there are top level domain servers the TLD server now these are the servers that contain the records for the top level domains examples of top level domains are.org net.edu so on and so forth now each of these servers contains all of their information for their respective domains kind of and what do I mean by kind of well the TLD servers do delegate down to second level servers their information they do that to ease the load so that the TLD server is not overloaded but the TLD server is the server that is responsible for maintaining the record then there's the root server this is the server that contains all of the records for the TLD servers so if you're looking for a TLD that is kind of unknown you will actually go to the root server which will then pass you onto the appropriate TLD then there are authoritative servers and nonauthoritative servers an authoritative DNS server is one that responds to a request and that authorit server has been specifically configured to contain the requested information an authoritative response comes from a DNS server that actually holds the original record so an authoritative response comes from the name server that's been specifically configured to contain that record then there are nonauthoritative DNS servers now a nonauthoritative DNS server is one that responds to a to a request with DNS information that it received from another DNS server a nonauthoritative response is not a response from the official name server for the domain instead it is a second or thirdhand response that's given back to the requester in most cases when we send a DNS request we get a nonauthoritative response back now let's move on to the various DNS record types the first record that we're going to talk about is the a record now the a record Maps host names or fqdns to their respective ipv4 addresses closely associated with the a record is the AAAA record or quadruple a record this Maps the fqdn to its respective IPv6 address then there's the C name record now this Maps a canonical name or Alias to a host name what that means is that you can have edcc.edu be the same as EDC dog without having to maintain two sites the edcc.edu this works in part because of the pointer record the PTR record it's a pointer record that points out to DNS that there is a canonical name and finally we have the MS record now this record maps to the email server that is specified for a specific domain it is the record that determines how email travels from sender to recipient and now let's move on to Dynamic DNS now Dynamic DNS or ddns permits lightweight and immediate updates to a local DNS database this is very useful for when the fqdn or host name Remains the Same but the IP address is able to change on a regular basis Dynamic DNS is implemented as an additional service to DNS and it's implemented through DD NS updating now this is a method of updating traditional name servers without the intervention of an administrator so there's no manual editing or inputting of the configuration files required a ddns provider supplies software that will monitor the IP address of the referenced system once the IP address changes the software sends an update to the proper DNS server ddns is useful for when access is needed to a domain whose IP address is being supplied dynamically by an ISP or Internet service provider that way the IP address can change but people can still get to the service that they're looking for now that concludes this session on the introduction to the DNS service we talked about DNS servers we moved on to DNS records and then we concluded with a very brief discussion about Dynamic DNS now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm pretty sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace session introducing Network address translation today we're going to be talking about the purpose of network address translation and then we're going to discuss how Network address translation works and with that let's go ahead and begin this discussion of course we're going to begin by talking about the purpose of network address translation Network address translation or n solves a very serious problem of how to route non routable IP addresses as a partial effort to conserve the ipv4 address space the private ipv4 addressing spaces were developed these address spaces were removed from the public ipv4 address space and made non routable across public ipv4 network and this led to the problem being non routable prevents that private ipv4 address from communicating with remote public networks natat very simply solves this problem a router with Nat enabled will translate a private IP address into a routable public IP address when the response returns to the router it passes passes the response back to the device that requested it so now that we've covered the purpose let's talk about how Network address translation works and first off we get to talk about the fact that there are two categories of net first up is static net with static net each private IP address is assigned to a specific routable public IP address this relationship is kept and maintained by the natat enabled router when a device needs access outside of the local network the router translates the local IP address to the assigned public IP address and when the response comes back the router will translate the public IP address back into a local one static n is not flexible and leads to some scalability issues an individual routable IP address must be kept for every device that requires access outside of the local network so as the network grows you need to increase the amount of public IP addresses that are under your control that gets kind of expensive and kind of complicated they developed Dynamic Gat to resolve some of that issue with Dynamic Gat the natat enabled router dynamically assigns a routable IP address to devices from a pool of available IP addresses when a device needs access outside of the local network the router performs the net function only the public IP address comes from a reusable pool of public IP addresses that private IP address is assigned the public IP address from the pool and once outside access is stopped the routable I IP address goes back into the pool to be reused as initially designed Dynamic Gat was more flexible than static n but it still led to some scalability issues as more Network traffic required access to outside networks the pool of available public IP addresses needs to increase or outside access cannot be achieved but thankfully there is a solution to this and that solution is called port address translation or in Cisco terms that would be natat with Pat Pat is a type of dynamic Gat that was developed to increase the scalability of network address translation when a local network device requires access to a public network the natat enabled router dynamically assigns the public IP address to the device with the addition of dynamically assigning a port number to the the end of the public IP address the router tracks the IP addresses and port numbers to ensure that Network traffic is routed to and from the proper devices Pat still requires a pool of public IP addresses but the pool may only contain one public IP address or it may contain several for a large private Network this is the preferred method of implementing Network address trans translation for two reasons first off there's less public IP addresses that are required and it makes it easier for an administrator to maintain now let's talk about natat terminology specifically about the types of addresses and we begin with the inside local address which is a private IP address on the local network it is the private IP address assigned to a specific device then there's the inside global address a public address referencing an inside device the inside global address is the public IP address assigned to the inside device by the natat enabled router allowing access outside of the network then there's the outside global address which is a public IP address referencing an outside device it is the public public IP address assigned to a device outside of the local network then there's the outside local address which is a private IP address assigned to an outside device this is the private IP address assigned to the outside device by the natat enabled router on the interior of the local network so that the inside device can communicate correctly with the outside device device now that concludes this session on introducing Network address translation we talked about the purpose of network address translation and then we talked about how Network address translation works on behalf of pacit thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on Wan Technologies part one today I'm going to be talking about the public switched telephone Network then I'm going to move on to Broadband cable and I'm going to conclude with a brief section on fiber optics and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course we begin with the public switched telephone Network before I begin with the public switch telephone Network let's talk about what makes a w a w as opposed to a lan well as a general rule if you own and control the line that the data is using to get from one place to another you are not using a wide area network or W technology on the other hand if you are using a form of transmission that you don't own as in you're leasing a line or you're paying for the use of it then you are likely using W technology one of the most common physical infrastructures used in Wan technology is the public switched telephone Network the pstn due to its widespread availability just about everybody has a telephone line being run to their house or to their building an older technology but still somewhat valid today for w technology is dialup now dialup utilizes the pstn to transmit Network traffic as an analog signal dialup does require an analog modem to format the network traffic correctly so it can be transmitted your maximum theoretical speed on dialup is 56 kilobits per second it's not very fast then there's ISDN Integrated Service digital Network ISDN is a digital pointtopoint W technology that utilizes the pstn it's a completely digital service it requires the use of a terminal adapter or ta to make the connection to the end nodes this ta is often called a digital modem but it's not it's a terminal adapter ISDN can use a primary rate interface or pry now the pry is composed of 23 64 kilobit pers second B channels and one 64 kilobit pers second D channel that dchannel is used for call setup and Link management a pry can achieve 1.544 megabits per second speed and that is commonly referred to as a T1 least line the most commonly implemented form of an ISDN though is the Bri the basic rate interface it uses only two B channels and One D Channel and the bri can achieve speeds of up to 128 kilobits per second now ISDN is not as capable as a digital subscriber line or DSL but it can often be implemented Where DSL cannot be installed speaking about DSL let's move on to it xdsl is the term for generic DSL DSL is a digital when technology that utilizes the pstn DSL does require the use of a digital modem it uses a dedicated digital line between the endpoint and a class5 central office or Co now in order for the most basic forms of DSL to be installed you have to be within 18,000 ft of the co DSL is capable of carrying voice and data when it does carry both filters are put in place in order for the voice signal to come through without any interference now let's move on to the different types of DSL and first up is symmetric DSL or sdsl symmetric DSL is synchronous in nature that means that the upload and download speeds are the same sdsl does not carry voice communication so if you need voice service an additional line is going to be needed sdsl is used by businesses that don't quite need the performance of a T1 least line but they do require the symmetrical upload and download speeds more common than sdsl is ADSL or asymmetric DSL it's asynchronous in nature that means that the upload speed is slower than the download speed ADSL can carry data and voice common upload speeds for ADSL are 768 kilobits per second with download speeds of up to 9 megabits per second it is the most common implementation of DSL in the small office home office environment last up for DSL is vdsl or very high bit rate DSL it's a synchronous in nature as well it's used when high quality video and voice over IP is necessary vdsl is commonly limited to download speeds of 52 megabits per second with an upload speed of 12 megabits per second that's a whole lot faster than ADSL but vdsl is only possible when you're located within 4,000 ft of a central office there is an exception to what I just told you though the current standards do allow for up to 100 megabits per second speed over the pstn using vdsl but in order to achieve that you must be within 300 M of the central office now that the pstn is out out of the way let's move on to Broadband cable Broadband cable is coaxial cable networking it's a broadband connection to a location delivered by the cable company Broadband cable can deliver voice data and television all through the same connection and the way it works is the digital signal is delivered to the headend this is where all the cable signals are received the signal is then processed and formatted and then transmitted to the distribution Network the distribution network is a smaller service area served by the cable company the distribution Network architecture can be composed of fiber optic cabling or coaxial cabling and or a hybrid fiber coaxial cabling or hfc unlike DSL the bandwidth of the distribution Network is shared by all of those who connect to it this can lead to increased latency and congestion during busy times the final distribution to the premise is usually through a coaxial cable the other thing that you need to know about Broadband cable is that all cable modems and similar devices must measure up to the isp's required data over cable service interface specification or docis spe specification if it doesn't measure up you're not going to achieve the speeds that you expect now let's conclude with fiber fiber optic networking is using light to transmit data and voice this allows for more bandwidth over greater distances fiber optic networking is more expensive to install but it's also less susceptible to line noise the fiber synchronous data transmission standard in the United States is called the synchronous Optical Network or Sonet standard the international standard is called the synchronous digital hery or sdh both Sonet and sdh Define the base rates of transmission over fiber optic cabling which are known as Optical carrier levels dense wavelength division multiplexing is a method of multiplexing several Optical carrier levels together up to 32 of them into a single fiber optic cable effectively increasing the bandwidth of that single optical fiber instead of dwdm you could use cwdm coar wavelength division multiplexing it's similar to dwdm but it only allows for up to eight channels on a single fiber when fiber optic is delivered Ed to the premise it's usually delivered over a passive Optical Network or Pawn a pawn is a point to multipoint technology that uses a single optical fiber that's used to connect multiple locations to the internet the passive Optical Network uses unpowered Optical Splitters now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part one I talked about the public switch telephone Network then we moved on to Broadband cable and I briefly ran through fiber optic networking on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing another good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on Wan Technologies part two today we're going to be discussing GSM and CDMA Wan connections then we're going to move on to YX W connections and we're going to conclude with satellite wide area network connections there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course I'm going to begin with the GSM and CDMA wide area network connections all cellular carriers use one of two methods for connecting devices to their networks and those methods are not compatible currently in the United States AT&T and TMobile use the global system for mobile or GSM standard to connect their devices to their networks both Sprint and Verizon use code division multiple access also known as CDMA as their me method of connecting to networks and those two standards are not compatible the majority of the rest of the world utilizes GSM as the method for cellular network access let me speak briefly about cellular networking cellular networking involves using the cellular phone system for more than just phone calls cellular networking has been around for a while and it originally wasn't known as this but the first version of it is first G or 1G cellular and it was only capable of voice Transmissions as improvements came along we got 2G that is cellular with simple data transmission capabilities as in text messaging 2G Edge offered some basic cellular networking connectivity and was a stop Gap measure between 2G and third generation cellular 3G cell cellular is the beginning of cellular wi networking it's giving way to 4G cellular which is still an emerging technology 4G currently consists of both LTE and yaax as a special mention we need to talk about evolved highspeed packet access which is HSPA plus it was a stop gap between 3G and 4G networking it's still available today the current standard for HSPA plus allows for up to a maximum data rate of 84 megabits per second now it's not quite as good as LTE which is longterm Evolution LTE uses an all IP based core with high data rates now LTE is compatible with both 3G and yaax the current standard for LTE allows for up to 300 megabits per second in download speeds and up to 75 megabits per second in upload speeds now let me introduce you to ymax WAN connections ymax stands for worldwide interoperability for microwave access that's a mouthful that's why we say ymax ymax was originally developed as a last mile alternative to use when DSL or cable was not available it can provide an alternative broadband connection to a fixed location it uses microwave Transmissions as an overtheair method to transmit voice and data it does require line of sight between relay stations but ymax can be used to cover significant Geographic distances also many municipalities are exploring the use of ymax as a means of providing reasonably priced Broadband to their citizens without having to wire every household yaax is often considered to be a type of 4G technology because it is compatible with LTE networks but yaax is not compatible with third generation cellular networks it is time for us to conclude with satellite W connections satellite Wan connections are a type of microwave satellite networking it uses microwave Transmissions as an overtheair method of transmitting voice and data just like yaax it can be an effective means of extending networks into places that are hard to reach it does use microwave radio relay as the method of transmitting data through the atmosphere just like yat it requires line of sight relay stations but it can cover even more distances than yaax why is that that's because it utilizes a satellite Network by the way because of the distances that satellite Transmissions can cover this can lead to latency problems think about it the Signal's got to go from a terrestrial location up to the satellite probably over to another satellite and then down to another terrestrial station that's a significant amount of distance and there's going to be some lag I just talked about the communication satellite that are also known as comsats these do form part of the microwave relay Network comsats can use a variety of orbits including the molia geostationary low polar or polar orbits the low polar and polar orbits are used to boost microwave signals before sending the signal back to Earth now that concludes cludes this session on W Technologies part two I briefly talked about GSM and CDM W connections then I moved on to a yaax Wan connections and then we concluded with satellite Wan connections now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on Wan Technologies part three today I'm going to briefly discuss Metro ethernet W connections then I'm going to move on to least line Wan connections and we're going to conclude with some common standards and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing Metro ethernet W connections a Metro ethernet connection is when the service provider connects to the customer's site through an RJ45 connector the customer will view that Wang connection as an ethernet connection while in reality the type of connection will be dependent upon the level of service that has been purchased the service provider may also use a variety of different wide area Network Technology behind the scenes but the customer will always view it as being an ethernet connection Metro ethernet is commonly deployed as a wide area Network Technology by municipalities at the metropolitan area network or Man level as in at the municipal level it's time for us to discuss least line Wan connections a least line is a dedicated circuit or connection between two endpoints used for communication when we're talking about it a least line is usually a digital pointtopoint connection a least line can utilize either a plain old telephone service line a pots line on the public switched telephone Network or it can be a fiber optic circuit provided by a telecom Communications company leased lines tend to be more expensive for the customer as the circuit can't be utilized by any other entity so the whole cost is born by the customer because they're the only ones who get to use it most often the speed of a leas line is limited by what the customer is willing to pay there are some multiplexing technologies out there that can be used to increase the amount of channels that are provided on the connection one of the least line technologies that you need to know about is pointto point protocol PPP it is a common data link layer or layer 2 protocol that's used with least line networks PPP can simultaneously transmit multiple layer three protocols it can transmit IP and ipx and apple talk all at the same time through the use of control protocols which are actually specific to the layer three protocol that's being transmitted PPP can include a feature called multilink PPP which allows for multiple physical interfaces to be bonded together and act as a single logical interface this effectively increases the available bandwidth to that system there are different types types of least line connections in the United States Japan and South Korea there are t carrier lines each tline is composed of 24 Digital Signal channels these are often called Digital Signal zero channels are DSO channels each channel is capable of carrying 64 kilobits per second the 24 dsos make up what is called a DS1 channel in in Europe we have ecarrier lines each eline is composed of 30 Digital Signal channels these are also called DSO channels the 30 DSO channels also make up what is called a DS1 Channel when we're talking about fiber optic speeds we often talk about Optical carrier lines our OC lines the OC data rates per channel are established by both the Sonic and sdh networking standards Sonet is the United States standard and SD is the international standards interestingly enough the OC rates are the same across the two standards it's possible to Multiplex multiple channels into the same fiber using different methods the first method is dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm it allows for up to 32 separate channels on a single fiber cable or you could use coar wavelength division multiplexing which allows for up to eight separate channels on a single fiber optic cable let's conclude with common standards the standards I'm going to be talking about are the speeds and we begin with t lines a T1 is composed of 24 DSO channels which are also known as a DS1 and it's capable of achieving speeds of up to 1.544 megabits per second if that's not fast enough for you you can lease a T3 line it's composed of 28 T1 lines now a T3 line is also known as a DS3 and it can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 36 megabits per second if if you're in Europe you might lease an E1 line an E1 line which is composed of 30 DSO channels can achieve speeds of up to 2.48 megabits per second just as with the United States if that's not fast enough for you you can lease an E3 line which is composed of 16 E1 lines which gives you up to 34. 368 megabits per second speed while a T1 is slower than an E1 a T3 is faster than an E3 for OC lines we have the oc1 it's capable of 51.84 megabits per second in speed then there is the oc3 which gives you up to 155.52 megabits per second speed it's becoming more common now to see oc1 12s with those you get up to 622.org megabits per second if you want gigabit type speed you might consider leasing an oc48 that gives you up to 2488 gbits per second in bandwidth currently at the top of the line is the OC 192 that gives you up to 9953 gbits per second speed so essentially 10 gbits per second worth a bandwidth now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part three I briefly discussed Metro ethernet Wan connections and then I went on to a discussion about least line Wan connections and then I briefly mentioned some common standards on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian and welcome to Pace it session on Wan Technologies part 4 today I'm going to be discussing the difference between circuit switched and packet switched networks then I'm going to move on to a discussion comparing frame relay versus asynchronous transfer mode and then we're going to conclude with multiprotocol label switching there's a whole lot of ground to cover not a whole lot of time let's go go ahead and begin this session let's begin this session by talking about circuit switched and packet switched networks circuit switch networks have a dedicated circuit between two endpoints that is used for communication while set up the circuit can only be used for communication between those ends circuit switch networks are most common in networks with least line communication channels they're best used when there needs to be a fair amount of continuous data traffic between the two endpoints and with circuit switched networks there is only one path for the data to take on the other hand in packet switch networks data is broken up into smaller chunks and moved through the network only to be reassembled at the other end the data is routed using the destination address and the data may take different paths through the Network that it's traveling through as a general rule packet switch networks are less expensive to maintain why because the user doesn't have to maintain a dedicated circuit 24/7 they're only paying for what they're using now let's talk about the differences between frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode frame relay is a Wan technology in which variable length packets are switched across the network frame relay is less expensive than least lines but frame relay can be made to look like a least line through virtual circuits or VCS a frame relay network will track a VC using a data link connection identifier to identify the ends of the VC there are two terms associated with frame relay that you should be aware of the first is access rate that is the maximum speed of the frame relay interface the other term is the committed information rate the CI that's the guaranteed bandwidth that a customer receives so that's the minimum speed of that frame relay Network the access rate may be higher but the customers always guaranteed the committed information rate now let's talk about asynchronous transfer mode also known as ATM ATM is a Wan technology in which fixed length cells are switched across the network these cells are always 53 bytes long ATM can handle realtime voice and video because it's very fast but it has poor bandwidth utilization the small cell size reduces the efficiency of the technology but ATM is very fast even if it is inefficient common speeds on an at ATM network are 51.84 megabits per second and 155.52 megabits per second let's conclude with multiprotocol label switching the acronym for multiprotocol label switching is MLS MLS is a topology that's growing in popularity why because it's scalable also it is protocol independent MLS can be used to replace both frame relay switching and ATM switching it can be used to packet switch both frame relay and ATM network traffic this allows MLS to be used with both frame relay and ATM Technologies MLS is often used to improve quality of service and flow of network traffic it uses a label Edge router to add NLS labels to incoming packets if they don't have them the label Edge router then passes those packets onto a label switching router or LSR router the LSR forwards those packets based on their MLS labels to their final destination now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part four I talked about the differences between a circuit switched and packet switch Network then we moved on to frame relay versus asynchronous transfer mode and we concluded with a brief discussion on multiprotocol label switching on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on the network cabling part one today we're going to be talking about twisted pair network cabling then we're going to talk about twisted pair Network connectors and then we will conclude with categories of twisted pair I have a whole lot of information to cover and I need to get through this quickly so let's go ahead and begin this session and we'll Begin by talking about twisted pair network cabling most people are familiar with twisted pair cables because they are the standard in the modern land they are what you see most often when you're looking at Network CA twisted pair cables are composed of four pairs of wires contained within an insulating sheath each pair of wires is Twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference which is called Emi The Twist rates differ between the pairs to reduce cross talk between the pairs which is a type of Emi the colors of the pairs of wires are always white orange orange white blue blue white green green and white brown brown twisted pair network cabling comes an either unshielded or shielded twisted pair that would be UTP or STP the difference is that STP has an additional Shield that is either wrapped around each pair of wires or around all four pairs of wires that shielding reduces the opportunity for Emi or cross talk but it is more expensive and a little harder to work with because it's not as flexible UTP or unshielded twisted pair is deployed in the network much more often than STP there are also plenum and nonplenum types of twisted pair most twisted pair cabling is nonplenum grade but building codes often call for Plum grade cable to be run in plenum spaces now a plum space is that area that is designed to assist in the air flow of a building for HVAC purposes and most often the plenum is that space between the false ceiling and the actual ceiling plenum cable is jacketed in either a fire retardant cover or in a low smoke PVC jacket Plum cables often have a polymer or nylon strand woven into the cabling or into the jack ET to help take the weight of hanging cables this reduces the chance for the cable to stretch which can cause the pair or pairs of wires inside the jacket to break twisted pair is usually either a straight through cable or a crossover cable but it can also be used to create a rollover or console cable a straight through cable is used to connect different types of devices together as in a computer to a switch or a switch to a router well a crossover cable is used to connect similar devices together as in a PC to a PC or a switch to a switch the straight through and crossover cable use different pinouts to achieve their connections a rollover or console cable is often required to connect to the console port on a switch or a router it is quite common for one end of the rollover cable to use an RJ45 connector while the other end utilizes an rs232 also called a DB9 connector so now that I've mentioned those connectors let's go on to twisted pair Network connectors and we're going to begin with the rj11 you don't see these very much in what we think of as networking but you do see them all the time the rj11 uses a six position 4 contact modular connector that's a 6p 4C modular mod connector it can carry data or voice and its common usage is voice communication telephoning all of your telephone Jacks are rj1 111s then there's the RJ45 this is the one that we always think about when we think about networking with twisted pair of cabling it uses an 8 position 8 contact or 8p 8C modular connector it can carry data or voice and its common usage is data networking ethernet then there's the rj48c it also uses an 8 position 8 contact modular connector 8p8c just like the RJ45 as a matter of fact it's often thought of as being an RJ45 but it's used as the terminating connector at the dmark point for T1 lines and as I said just a moment ago it's often confused with the RJ45 but the active pin are different then we have the UTP coupler the unshielded twisted pair coupler it's used to connect UTP cables backto back and still maintain adherence to Industry standards you might still come across the 66 block being used for network connections but probably not it's a punchdown block that was initially developed to terminate and distribute telephone lines in an Enterprise Network so you might still see it for telephony but it's getting a little bit harder to find it it was also used in slower speed networks as it can handle data traffic That's rated for cat 3 cabling much more likely you'll find a 110 block now this is a punchdown block that was developed to terminate and distribute twisted pair network cabling it's capable of handling the signaling requirements of the modern Network I mentioned the DB9 or rs23 2 connector earlier well here we go it is a 9 pin D subminiature connector developed for asynchronous serial communication between nodes it was a common type of connector between a computer and an external modem and as I said earlier it often makes up one end of the rollover cable you might come across the db25 also known as an eia 2 32 or rs232 serial connector it is a 25 pin duub miniature connector developed for asynchronous serial communication between nodes just like the DB9 only it was larger it too provided a type of connection between a computer and an external analog modem and it's even less common than the DB9 now let's move on to categories of of twisted pair and we begin with cat 3 cat 3 was rated for up to 10 megabits per second speed that's 10 Bas T networking and it had a maximum distance of 100 m by the way unless I specify all twisted pair cabling has a max distance of 100 m that 10 megabits per second wasn't quite fast enough so then we got cap five cap five is rated for up to 100 megabits per second speed that's 100 Bas T networking and that still wasn't fast enough so they developed cap 5e cap 5e is rated for up to 1 gigabits per second that's 1,000 base T now we have cat 6 cat 6 is rated for up to 10 gbits per second that's 10 GB Ethernet or 10 GBE and with cat 6 you can can only get that 10 gbits per second over a max distance of 55 M for some reason they thought they needed to go more distance than 55 M so they developed cat 6A it has the same speed ratings as cat 6 but it has a max distance of 100 m and you can still achieve that 10 gbits per second networking now that concludes this session on network cabling part one I talked about twisted pair cabling then I talked about twisted pair Network connectors and I concluded with the categories of twisted pair cabling now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network cabling part two today we're we're going to be talking about coaxial cabling and fiber optic cabling there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we're going to begin by talking about coaxial cabling coaxial or coax cabling is one of the oldest ethernet standards for network cabling it was standardized in 1973 it's been used for baseband carries just a single digital signal and it has been used for Broadband carrying multiple digital signals it is composed of a central conductor that is covered by an insulating layer which is covered by an outer mesh or foil layer which is then finished off with an outer insulating layer that inner metal mesh layer helps to protect against electromagnetic interference Emi there are several different types of coax cable there is RG58 it was used in 10base 2 networking it could span a maximum distance of 185 M and had a 50 ohms impedance value it's no longer commonly found in the modern Network then there's rg59 it's commonly used to provide a broadband connection between two devices over a short distance and it has a 75 ohms impedance value and it's only used for short distances because it leaks its signal it can't span very far then we have RG6 which is used for cable TV or Broadband now the distance that RG6 can spand varies but it still has a 75 ohms impedance value and it's commonly used to make the connection to a cable modem by the cable company there are are two basic types of coax cable connectors there is the BNC also known as the bayonet Neil councilman connector you can also call it a bayonet connector it is used with coax cabling but is now considered obsolete the connection from the cable to the device was achieved through a springloaded Twist lock type of connector a BNC coupler can also be used to connect two coax cables segments back to back much more common is the F connector it's a threaded bayet connector and it's also used with coax cable an F connector coupler can be used to connect two coax cable segments back to back now let's move on to fiber optic cabling so now let me describe fiber optic cabling first off it's relatively expensive and harder to work with than with other types of network cabling it's not as common as other types either coax or twisted pair in the land environment but it can resist all forms of electromagnetic interference and it cannot be easily tapped into that means it's harder for people to ease drop on your network Transmissions it also can cover long distances at high speed fiber optic cabling is designated by fiber type cladding size by the way the cladding is what the light bounces down and it's jacket size that outer jacket that covers the cable the size of the cladding and the size of the jacket are listed in micrometers most applications of fiber optic cabling require that the cables be run in pairs one cable to send Transmissions one cable to receive Transmissions the type of connector used on fiber optic cabling can impact act the performance of the transmission there are two basic categories of connectors there is the UPC the ultra physical contact this connector has a back reflection rating of around a NE 55 dbel loss then there's the APC the angled physical connector which has a back reflection rating of around a 70 DB loss making it the better performance form in connector now let's talk about fiber types there's multimode fiber which uses an infrared LED system to transmit light down the fiber it sends multiple rays of lights down the cable at the same time it is used for shorter fiber runs under 2 km it is less expensive than the other type of fiber cabling then we have single mode fiber SMF it us uses a laser diode arrangement to transmit light down the fiber it only sends a single ray of light down the cable even though my diagram depicts it as going straight it still bounces down the cladding but there's only one of them it's used for longer runs that require high speed and it can span more than 40 km so now let's talk about fiber optic CA and connectors and first up is the SC that is the subscriber connector or the square connector you can also call it a standard connector an easy way to remember it is stick and click it's a push pull type connector then we have the St the straight tip you can also think of this as stick and twist it is a springloaded Twist lock type of connector there's also the LC which can be called the local connector or loosened connector or little connector it's a type of connector that uses a locking tab to secure the connection similar to the LC is the mtrj the mechanical transfer registered Jack it's a small form factor connector that contains two fibers and that also utilizes a locking tab to secure the connection you might also find a fiber optic coupler guess what it does it's used to connect two fiber optic cables back to back now that concludes this session on network cabling part two I talked about coaxial cabling and I concluded with fiber optic cabling now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pce it T's session on network cabling part three today I'm going to be talking about media converters and then I'm going to talk about some cabling tools that you should know about and with that let's go ahead and begin today's session I will Begin by discussing media converters it is not uncommon to be in a situation where Network contains more than one type of cabling this can lead to a situation where there's a desire to connect different types of media together in order to make a cohesive or single Network thankfully media converters are readily available the issue of trying to connect these disparate types of transmission together mostly comes into play when you're trying to join a fiber optic transmission to a copper wire infrastructure and that's actually represented in the types of readily available media converters that that are out there the most common media converters will connect single mode fiber to ethernet or multimode Fiber to ethernet or single mode fiber to multimode fiber and finally there is a fiber to coaxial cabling media converter you need to be aware that these devices are out there to help you create a solid Network now let's move on to cabling tools so every technician should put some thought into the tools that are in his or her toolbox it is often said that you get what you pay for and that is very true with tools while a good technician can get away with buying the most inexpensive tools by spending a little more money for a better tool that can often make the task easier and ultimately make the technician more efficient but you also need to be aware that you can spend more money than is necessary and not utilize all of the features in a given tool so you need to find that balance point between spending too much money and not spending enough money to become a really efficient technician now let's move on to the tools themselves and we'll begin with crimpers crimpers are used to place cable ends on cables they can be designed to work with a single type of cable as in twisted pair or with multiple types of cable I've seen some crimpers that have been able to work with rj1 111s rj45s and with a coaxial F connector next up are wire strippers wire strippers are used to remove the insulating covers on wires and cables many are designed to just cut through the insulation without damaging the cable contained within that insulation but some are also designed to cut all the way through the cable so that excess cabling can be trimmed when you're using those to cut insulation you need to be careful that you don't cut the underlying cable then there are punchdown tools these are used to secure cable wires into punchdown blocks a good punchdown tool will trim the ends at the same time as it places the wire in the punch down block then there are cable testers these are used to test cables for common problems as in misconfiguration of the ends or incorrect pinouts cable testers will often test for the cable standard used either the t568a or the t568b or they can tell you whether or not you've created a crossover cable cable testers will test for shorts or breaks in the continuity of the cable some types of testers can also test for cable length and quality these type of testers are called cable certifiers then we have the TDR the time domain reflectometer now this is a cable tester for copper cabling that can determine the length of a segment and the electrical characteristics of the cable also a TDR can tell you where a break hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on network topologies today we're going to discuss what a topology is then we're going to discuss peertopeer in client server networking and then we're going to talk about some common Network topologies and with that let's go ahead and begin this session so what is a topology well a topology is basically a map that can be used to describe how a network is laid out or how a network functions a network topology can be described as either being logical or physical a logical topology describes the theoretical signal path while the physical topology describes the physical layout of the network and you should know that a logical and physical topology don't need to match and with that let's move on to peertopeer versus the client server networks so are these really topologies no not really they don't describe the signal path or the physical layout of the network but yes they are topologies because they do describe how the network functions so that's why they're here in this discussion now in a peertopeer topology the nodes control and Grant access to resources on the network no one node or group of nodes controls access to a single specific type of resource there's no real server present each node is responsible for the resources it's willing to share now a client server topology differs Network resource access is controlled by a central server or servers a server determines what resources get shared who is allowed to use those resources and even when those resources can be used now in the small office home office it's common to find a hybrid topology that's where a combination of peertopeer and client server networking is used now let's move on to some common Network topology models the first one we're going to discuss is the bus the original ethernet standard established a bus topology for the network both logically and physically and what I mean by a bus topology is the signal traveled along a predetermined path from end to end it went from one direction to the other direction and then it could come back now as time went on the bus developed some mechanical problems that led to the development of different physical topologies but the logical topology remained the same in order to maintain backward compatibility so when we discuss ethernet networks the logical topology is always a bus topology while the physical topology can be different so let's talk about the bus again the signal traverses from one end of the network to the other now a Breaking the line breaks the network the ends of the bus line needed to be terminated in order to prevent signal bounce and what that means is that if there was a break or the ends of the line were not terminated when the signal got to the end it would bounce back through and create a storm in a bus topology the network cable is the central point now kind of related to the bus is the ring it's a bus line with the end point connected together a break in the ring breaks the ring in a ring topology it's common to use two rings multiple rings that counter rotate this safeguards against a break in one ring Bringing Down the whole network now ring topologies are not very common anymore in the land but they're still used in the wide area network especially when Sonet or SD is used moving on from The Ring we have the star the nodes radiate out from a central point now when a topology is implemented with a hub a break in a segment brings down the whole bus because the Hub retransmits out all ports now when it's implemented with a switch a break in a segment only brings down that segment it is the most common implementation in the modern land then there's the mesh a true mesh topology is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes that's a full mesh now those aren't very common because the they are expensive and difficult to maintain but it's common to find partial meshes that's where there are multiple paths between nodes now everyone knows at least one partial mesh Network and that would be the internet now let's move on to the point topoint topology that's where two nodes or systems are connected directly together now if you're talking about two PCS that's when they use a crossover cable to create a pointtopoint topology there there's no Central device to manage the connection now this is still a common topology when implemented across a Wan connection utilizing a T1 line we also need to discuss point to multipoint in a point to multipoint topology a central device controls the paths to all other devices this differs from a star in that the central device is intelligent now wireless networks often Implement point to multipoint to IES when the wireless access point sends all devices on the network receive the data but when a device sends its message is only passed along to the destination it's also a common topology when implementing a Wan across a packet switched Network now let's discuss MLS MLS is multiprotocol label switching and it is a topology that's used to replace both frame relay switching and ATM switching it's a topology because it specifies a signal path and layout MLS is used to improve the quality of service and flow of network traffic it uses label Edge routers LS which add MLS labels to incoming packets if they don't already have them now the ls add the labels and pass the packets along to lsrs label switching routers these forward packets based on their MLS labels that's what makes this a topology now that concludes this session on network topologies we discussed what a topology is then we discussed the differences between peertopeer and client server networking and then I brought up some common Network topology models that you should know now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on network infrastructure implementations today I'm going to be talking about design versus function and then I'm going to talk about categories of different networks and with that let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin this session by talking about the difference between design and function when describing a network you have a couple of different options are you describing its design or its function if you are going to describe its design then the first place to start is to describe its topology is it a bus network is it a star Network or a point too but if you're going to describe how the network functions then the first place to start is to describe the category or infrastructure implementation of that Network and with that let's move on to categories of networks first up is the local area network or the landan most lands are encompassed by a single Network address range that address range may be broken up into subgroups through the use of virtual local area networks vlans a land can span anywhere from a small area like a single room to a whole building or a small group of buildings the land tends to be the highest speed Network it is becoming more common to see 10 gbits per second networking on the land the most common types of network on the land are the 802.3 or ethernet Andor the 802.11 or Wireless local area network these are the most common types of network found on the land then there is the metropolitan area network or the man it is larger than a land most often it contains multiple local area networks mans or metropolitan area networks are often owned by municipalities when a man is owned by a private entity it is sometimes called a campus area network then there is the Wan the wide area network now A W spans significant Geographic distances they can be described as a network of networks and the best example of a Wan is the internet so how do you tell when a man becomes a Wan well as a general rule if all of the infrastructure implementation has a single owner then it is not a Wan if it's large it'll be a man and if it's not quite so large it'll be a lan but it's really easy to tell a personal area network a pan why because they are extremely distant and size limited most often a pan is a connection between only two devices common examples include a Bluetooth connection between a keyboard and a computer that's a pan then there are infrared or IR connect C between a smartphone and a printer that's a pan another example of a pan is near field communication which is now becoming seen between a smartphone and a payment terminal the pan tends to have low throughput of data and low power output they don't consume a whole lot of power as the distance between devices increase the throughput on a pan will decrease now a couple of special categories of networks and first is the supervisory control and data acquisition Network the scata network now a scata network is a type of industrial control system or IC that is designed to control large scale deployments of equipment the controlled equipment is usually at more than one site scata is often deployed in energy distribution system systems by utility companies scata uses a distributed control system or DCS to communicate with programmable logic controllers plc's and or remote terminals to control the equipment and processes from a central location so they have a central location to control equipment that's at remote locations scatter networks are often proprietory and often require a additional training to understand them and operate them the last special mention on categories of networks is the Media Net it's a network designed and implemented specifically to handle voice and video they are designed and implemented to remove quality of service issues like latency or Jitter that can occur in other types of infrastructure a video teleconference Network or VTC is an example of a Media Net they are often implemented as its own infrastructure or as a sub infrastructure of a larger Network that concludes this session on network infrastructure implementations I talked about the differences between design and function of networks and I concluded with a discussion on the different categories of networks on behalf of P it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to ipv4 part one today we're going to be talking about the purpose of Ip addressing and then we're going to move on to some ipv4 address properties there's a whole lot of ground to cover and we need to do it quickly so let's go ahead and begin this session of course we're going to start with the purpose of Ip addressing when Bob on network a wants to view a web page hosted on a server on network C how does Bob's computer know where to send him well somehow Bob has gotten that server's IP address either an ipv4 format or IPv6 IP addresses are the location of a PC or server or some other network device that identifies it by both its Network location and host location within that Network IP addressing provides a logical addressing scheme for our computers so that they can communicate on networks being logical means that the IP address can be changed ched with minimal fuss at any time unlike the MAC address or the media Access Control address which is physically embedded into the device on the other hand IP addresses are programmed in and are easily changed now that we know the purpose of Ip addressing let's move on to some ipv4 address properties ipv4 is made up of a 32bit binary number that means there are two to the 32nd power possible address combinations that gives us 4 b294 m967 296 possible address combinations with all of these possibilities a process needed to be developed to keep everything neat and tidy and most of all find able the implementation of a subnet mask was the answer and I'll get to that subnet mask in just a moment something that you will find useful is learning how to convert from binary to decimal now decimal is base two that means there are only zeros and ones as opposed to the base 10 that we're all used to dealing with if you would like more information on how to convert from decimal to Binary or binary to decimal you can go to that website that's listed under this heading so now let's talk about the initial properties of ipv4 it is a 32bit binary number as I said before it's divided into four sets of eight called octets These are separated by periods or decimals each octet is 8 Bits which equals 1 byte we often represent ipv V4 addresses in a human friendly format that's called dotted decimal now when we look at this address 192.168.1 n that is an IP address but we don't know which portion is the network or which portion is the host to be able to resolve this it requires the use of a mask which determines or defines which portion is which this mask is called the subnet mask and the subnet mask has the same format as the IP address as in its 32 bits and it's represented in dotted decimal format so let's take a look at how an IP address and subnet mask operate together so we're going to begin with 1 192.168.1 n with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 now the 1 192.168.1 n is the IP address like I said and the other portion the 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask and it's easiest to show how the subnet masks by converting that dotted decimal back into binary so we can do that by deconstructing the IP address so the first octet would be 1 one followed by 6 Z that equals 192 the second octet is 1011 followed by three zeros that equals 168 that third octet is real easy it's seven zeros followed by a one and then we have the fourth octet which is four zeros a one two zeros and a one that equals N9 now if we deconstruct the subnet mask what we have is we have three octets that are full of ones and one octet that's full of zeros that represents that 255.255.255.0 now if we put the subnet mask under the representation of the IP address anything that's not covered by a one in the subnet mask is a part of the host address everything that is covered by a one is the network address so what we have for that IP address is that 1 192.168.1 is the network portion of the address and the node portion of the address is the nine and that's how the IP address and subnet mask work together to define the network and the node now that concludes this session on the introduction to ipv4 part one we talked about the purpose of Ip addressing and then we moved on to some ipv4 address properties now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure we'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on the introduction to ipv4 part two today we're going to talk about classes of ipv4 addresses and then we're going to move on to classless ipv4 addressing and we will conclude with a brief discussion on subnetting ipv4 addresses there's a whole lot of technical information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin by talking about classes of ipv4 addresses Internet Protocol version 4 ipv4 is a binary addressing scheme that's used for networking it was initially finalized as a standard in 1981 ipv4 is a common Network addressing scheme that is still being deployed today there is an issue though with ipv4 because of its structure and the growth and popularity of the internet most of the world has run out of assignable ipv4 addresses but thanks to some forethought it's still a valid scheme today we need to talk about classes of ipv4 addresses and we begin with a class class a network address Class A networks have an address range of 0 to 127 in the first octet that gives us addresses from 0.0.0.0 up to 12725 five. 255.255 the first octed on the left has a binary representation that always begins with a zero this gives us a possible 16 million 7772144 host addresses and the subnet mask with a Class A network is always 255.0.0.0 then there are class B Network addresses they have an address range of 128 to 191 in the first octet that means that class B networks can have a range of 128.0 do0 .0 up to 191 255.255.255.0 host and the subnet mask used with a class spe network is always 255.255.0.0 then there are class c network addresses and they have an address range in the first octet of 192 up to 223 that means that we have an address range of 1920. z.0 up through 223 255.255.255.0 Class C Network address give us a possible 254 post addresses or node addresses and the subnet mask with a Class C is always 255.255.255.0 the last class of address that you need to concern yourself with is the class D Network address it has an address range of 224 up through 239 in the first octave which means that it can range from 2240 up through 239 255 255.255 and that first octed on the left has a binary representation of 1 1 1 0 so the first four bits are always taken and they are always 1 1 1 0 now subnet masks are not defined for class D networking class FD Network addresses are used for multicast communication and finally we have a special class of addresses well kind of a class of addresses and that involves automatic private IP addressing a Pippa in some cases the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP process May Fail in these cases a node or host will selfconfigure an aipa address address now with an apipa address the first two octets are always 168 254 and if you see that in your IP configuration you know that you have a DHCP problem so one of the first methods that they used to conserve the ipv4 address space was they broke them out into public and private IP addresses public IP addresses are routable and being routable means that each public IP address is unique there can only be one now public IP addresses are not flexible you are assigned to your network space you're not really given a choice what your public IP address is going to be and then there are the private IP addresses these are non routable they do not need to be completely unique throughout the world they only have to be unique on their Network the first one that we're going to discuss is the class A license there is only one class a license you have a possible address range of 10.0.0.0 up through 10. they have an address range of 172.16.0.0 up through 17231 255.255 and last but not least is the Class C license there are 256 Class C licenses with a possible address range of 192.168.0.0 up through 192.168.255.255 5255 now private IP addressing is highly flexible you get to assign the network space it's not assigned to you now let's move on to classless ipv4 addressing now the classes of addresses actually limited the flexibility of ipv4 part of the reason for that was that the first routing protocols required the class structure and you would think that with over 4 billion possible IP addresses that we'd still have flexibility but we really didn't classless addressing which is called classless interdomain routing or cider was developed to slow the growth of routing tables it also slowed the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses it also created much more flexibility the subnet mask becomes fluid it's not rigid with cider addressing it does not affect the private address space ranges though even though the subnet mask is now fluid you still only have those range of addresses available and with the introduction of classless addressing subnetting is now possible and it's highly desirable so let's take a look at how cider notation works and we'll begin with 192.168.0 N with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 is 192.168.0 N24 that sl24 represents all of the ones in the subnet mask and that's those first three octets on the left the 255.255.255.0 255.0.0.0 but it now becomes fluid with cider we can take it and we can make it a 192.168.1 128.0 sl23 and what that really represents that sl23 is a subnet mask of 255.255 128.0 and that gives us a network of 192.168.1 128.0 which actually gives us a Host range of 192 .1 1681 1281 through 192.168.1 129. 254 that gives us 512 host addresses as opposed to the possible 254 now the broadcast address for that Network would be 192.168.1 129. 255 so now let's move on on to subnetting ipv4 addresses so what is subnetting well subnetting Cuts address spaces into smaller pieces it takes one range of addresses and splits it this creates flexibility and network design and creates efficiency in address space utilization so let's take a look at an example of subnetting and this will involve a small office Network so originally we have a network address of 22315 1.024 this is a Class C private Network and it gives us a possible 254 hosts available why only 254 well because a host cannot be assigned to the network address which is 22315 1.0 and it can't use the broadcast address which is 22315 15.125 in this example with this network address all the hosts in the network can see all the other nodes now let's say that for security considerations you want to split this into two networks well you can do this using subnetting so what you do is you take that sl24 Network and you create two25 networks and those would be 22315 1.0 25 and 22351 do1 12825 in this situation the first Network's host address range would be 22351 up through 22315 do11 126 and why is that well because you can't use the network address which is 22315 1.0 and you can't use the broadcast address which is is 22351 1227 the second address range that would be created through this subnetting process would give us a Host range of 22315 do11 129 up through 22315 1.254 that's because you can't use the network address which is 22351 1228 and you can't use the broadcast address which is to 23151 255 each of those subnets would have 126 possible host addresses so you took your possible 254 hosts available in one network and you broke it down so that that you now have two separate networks each that's capable of having 126 hosts and that's an example of subnetting an ipv4 address now that concludes this session on the introduction to ipv4 part two I talked about classes of ipv4 addresses I then moved on to classless ipv4 addressing and we concluded with a brief discussion on subnetting ipv4 addresses now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to IPv6 today we're going to be talking about the IPv6 address structure and then we're going to move on to IPv6 Network transmissions and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by by talking about the IPv6 address structure now IPv6 is the answer to the question of what do we do about running out of ipv4 addresses unlike ipv4 IPv6 will provide enough Internet Protocol IP addresses for the foreseeable future now shortly after the creation of ipv4 and its implementation the the organization that's tasked with assigning routable IP addresses realized the available ipv4 address space would not be enough in very short order if nothing was done the an then set about creating the replacement and they initially started by working on ipv5 while they were working on ipv5 they found that due to the popularity of the internet which was increasing at that point in time that it wasn't going to be enough so they scrapped ipv5 and began working on IPv6 now the I is confident that IPv6 will function as the replacement for ipv4 for many decades to come why are they so confident well we'll get to that here in just a moment now IPv6 works at layer three of the OSI model just like ipv4 does layer three of the OSI model is also known as the network layer and its major focus is logical Network and host addressing ipv 6's job is to provide logical Network and host addressing to devices IPv6 is a 128bit binary addressing scheme as opposed to ipv 4's 32 bits the 128 bits are grouped together in sets with each set being separated by a colon now each of these sets is 2 bytes long and a bite is 8 Bits for human readability kind of the binary IPv6 number is converted to hexadecimal that's base 16 with each hexadecimal number being equal to four bits now those four bits can actually be referred to as a nibble because it's half of a bite and IPv6 address is eight sets of four hexadecimal numbers each being separated by a colon that means that there are over 340 undecillion addresses available to IPv6 that's 2 to the 128 power which is roughly equal to 340 * 10 to the 36th power see that number there I'm not even going to begin to read that one to you so now let's talk about ipv 6's local ad address structure for the local address the first 64 bits on the left represent the local network and the last 64 bits on the right always represent the host the local address structure follows the eui or extended unique identifier format specifically the eui 64 format for those hosts that have a 48bit MAC address that 48 bits is actually padded with an extra 16 bits to make it 64 bits in length you can always tell a local address which is also called the link local address as it always begins with an fe80 with IPv6 every device gets both a local address and it gets a global address now the global address is unique there is only one and every device gets one the host address is still always the last 64 bits but every device actually gets assigned to a Global Network the network portion is actually composed of a routing prefix and a subnet this portion of the global address structure follows the classless in domain routing or cider convention with the number that follows the slash denoting the routing prefix that's the part of the extremely Global Network that you belong to the subnet is composed of the bits between the prefix and the eui 64 host address Global IPv6 addresses always begin in the range of 2,000 up through 3,999 in that first group of numbers on the left now in most cases the need for dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP has been eliminated when implemented IPv6 will autoconfigure both the local and the global addresses that are required for their networks when a device first comes online it will use the neighbor Discovery protocol NDP to discover what the required Network addresses are both the local and Global addresses this allows devices to configure its own IPv6 address without an administrator's inter intervention so let's talk about IPv6 notation the 128bit nature of IPv6 makes it cumbersome to write out and it can take up unnecessary space because of this some rules were developed to ease the burden and save space when you're looking at a group of IPv6 numbers any leading zeros in a set can be dropped the thing to really remember about IPv6 is that only a single set of consecutive zeros may be replaced with the double colon why is that well because if you could do it more than once how would routers and other devices know how many zeros to pad in there even with this ability to shorten it it's still difficult for us to remember IPv6 addresses but it is still easier to write out and it still conserves space within systems now let's move on to types of ipv 6 Network transmissions and we begin with the unicast unicast is on toone communication that is where a specific device is sending Network traffic to another specific device unicast can occur on the local network which remember always begins with fe80 or it can occur on the global Network then there's multicast which is one to a few communication with multicast a specific device is sending Network traffic to a specific group of devices that have registered to receive that traffic routers register to receive multicast Transmissions that involve the routing protocols that they are programmed to use with IPv6 multicast addresses always begin with an FF both IPv6 and ipv4 use both unicast and multicast Transmissions a unique type of transmission to IPv6 is anycast anycast is one to the closest communication this is where a specific device is sending Network traffic to a specific IPv6 address that has been assigned to multiple devices the router only sends the communication to the closest one at least from its perspective any cast transmission involves implementing DHCP V6 earlier I said we really don't need to worry about DHCP anymore but that's only partially true while IPv6 is capable of autoc configuring its own local and Global addresses in certain situations that's not always desirable DHCP V6 version 6 can be configured to hand out specific IPv6 addresses or duplicate IPv6 addresses when necessary that's useful for when load balancing a network or when Network redundancy has been created or when you have a user that has a tablet a cell phone and a laptop and you want to deliver the transmission to the closest device the device that he's using at that point in time that is where DHCP V6 comes in handy IPv6 and ipv4 are not compatible but we can do what's called a dual stack configuration that's where the network and devices on the network receive both an IPv6 configuration and an ipv4 configuration or we can use what's called tunneling there's 6 to4 tunneling which is used to encapsulate an IPv6 data packet and an ipv4 datagram allowing that IPv6 packet to travel across or through an all ipv4 Network 6 to4 tunneling can also be called too tunneling now that concludes this session on the introduction to IPv6 I talked about the IPv6 address structure and then I talked about IPv6 Network Transmissions now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to casit session on special IP networking Concepts today I'm going to be talking about the media Access Control address and then I'm going to talk about the difference between Collision domains and broadcast domains and we're going to conclude with types of network Transmissions there's a whole bunch of technical information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin the formal part of this session by discuss assing the media Access Control address all networking interfaces come with their own special address already configured that would be the media Access Control address the MAC address the MAC address is often referred to as the physical address or the burned in address of the interface while Mac addresses may be changed or spoofed most often it's set by the manufacturer and never actually changes now switches and other OSI layer 2 devices rely upon that Mac address in order to get network packets to their correct destinations the MAC address has a specific format actually it has two specific formats one is 48 bits in length and the other is 64 bits in length and both of them are represented by hexadecimal numbers both formats can be broken down into two parts the organizationally unique identifier or UI and the extended unique identifier the eui The Institute of electrical and electronic Engineers the it Triple E assigns all electronic manufacturers their own oui which always makes up the first portion of the MAC address each manufacturer then assigns its own eui to each device that is produced usually it is the serial number of that device theoretically no two interfaces will have the same Mac address I need to mention the eui 64 format IPv6 requires that the node address or the MAC address be in an eui 64 format so that Mac address has to be 64 bits in length if the eui of the interface is only 24 bits in length it is actually split into two parts and 16 bits of padding are added to create the eui 64 format now let's discuss the difference between Collision domains and broadcast domains before I can talk about Collision domains and broadcast domains I need to talk about carrier sense multiple access with Collision detection all ethernet networks use this technology also called csma with CD when transmitting data in an Ethernet Network all ethernet devices have equal access to the network media and are capable of transmitting data at any time this can lead to data collisions with csmac CD a device listens to the carrier signal on the network media if no other device is transmitting the device is free to send data if another device sends data at the same time a collision is possible which can corrupt the data the devices listen for collisions that's the Collision detection part if a collision occurs the devices will stop transmitting and wait a random period of time before attempting to transmit again to do this they use what is called a backoff algorithm with that out of the way now let me explain what Collision domains are Collision domains are an area of the network where packets or network traffic can Collide there are some devices that break up Collision domains they can be broken up by switches Bridges and routers but not by hubs on the other hand a broadcast domain is defined as all the nodes that can be reached by a broadcast transmission all the nodes that can be reached reside in the same network broadcast traffic cannot pass routers so the domain is also defined by the subnet mask and that subnet mask defines the network here's a special note technically IPv6 does not use broadcast Transmissions IPv6 replaces broadcast Transmissions with multicast transmissions and what do you know that's a good segue for us to discuss types of network Transmissions we're going to begin this section by talking about types of ipv4 network transmissions and first up is unicast unicast is a specific Source address transmission going to a specific Source destination address it can be thought of as on toone communication it's only two devices transferring data between each other then there's multicast transmission this is where a specific Source address transmission is going to a set of registered destination addresses this is one to a few communication routers often use multicast Transmissions to track their routes and to make changes to their routing tables and finally there are broadcast Transmissions this is where a specific Source address transmission is going to all addresses on the local network this can be considered as one to all communication because all devices on the local network are going to be able to receive this broadcast transmission so let's move on to types of IPv6 Network transmissions and IPv6 uses unicast just like ipv4 does IPv6 also uses multicast just like ipv4 where IPv6 differs is with any cast transmission any cast is where a specific Source address transmission is going to a specific IPv6 address that has been assigned to multiple devices the router uses an algorithm to determine which Mac address that has that specially configured IPv6 address is closest and only that device receives the anycast transmission anycast can be considered as one to the closest communication that concludes this session on special IP networking Concepts I talked about the MAC address I talked about the differences between a collision domain and a broadcast domain and then I concluded with a discussion on the types of network transmission now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to routing Concepts part one today I'm going to talk about the purpose of routing and then I'm going to move on to some basic routing Concepts there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session first up is the purpose of routing the basic purpose of routing is to connect different networ NWS together to allow them to communicate and pass data traffic between them most often routing Protocols are how networks determine where to send Network traffic that's the routes that they will take and these routing protocols build Maps actually they build routing tables but we'll get to that later that they use for directing Network traffic routing is what makes this interconnected World function as well as it does networking would be pure chaos without it as we'd have no idea where to send traffic now let's move on to some basic routing Concepts first up is static routing static routing uses administrator defined routes each router in a static routing configuration must contain the route a static route from router a to router B requires that router B has a static route back to router a in order for twoway communication to take place if we had a static route from A to B and B didn't have one back to a a could send traffic to B but B could not send traffic back to a now static routing is easy to set up in small networks but it's not so easy to maintain networks change all the time with static routing when a change occurs in routers the administrator has to go around to each router and Implement that change then there's Dynamic routing this is where routers use protocols in order to determine the best route between two networks the administrator determines which protocols will be used on the routers in order for the routers to communicate they must all be using the same protocols there is an exception to that and that's route redistribution an administrator can configure a router to take one Dynamic protocol and transform it into a different routing protocol to be used from that point on this is the only case when routing protocols can be different across the network routing protocols can be stacked within a router that means that there can be more than one Dynamic routing protocol programmed into a router Dynamic routing is very fluid and Dynamic and it's what makes possible today's interconnected world the next concept is the default route the default route is the direction that a router will send Network traffic when there is no known route in the routing table the default route is assigned by an administrator it is usually a designated interface on the router or it is the next designated next hop interface then then there is the routing table the routing table is a list of known routes to all known networks from the router's perspective it is established by an administrator when static routing is used it is dynamically built by routing protocols when Dynamic routing is employed each routing protocol maintains its own routing table different routing protocols may have different routes to the same network the loop back interface is an administratively configured logical number assigned to a router to ease administrative functions or routing processes often the loop back interface is assigned in an ipv4 address format even when ipv4 isn't used on the router many routing protocols have been designed to take the loop back interface into a when performing administrative functions the loop back interface may be completely logical or a physical interface may be assigned to be the loop back interface let's move on to routing Loops a routing Loop is a possible problem that can be created if interconnected routers have a breakdown in their routing algorithms when a routing Loop occurs Network traffic keeps looping through the routers until some system or mechanism breaks the cycle routing Loops can create network congestion or even bring down a network routing protocols use multiple methods to prevent routing Loops from occurring one of the main methods that they use is What's called the time to live field or the TTL field the TTL field keeps track of how long that packet has been in existence and how far it has traveled and after a specified amount of time or distance it will inform the next router to drop it this helps to prevent routing Loops that concludes this session on the introduction to routing Concepts part one I talked about the purpose of routing and then I moved on to some basic routing Concepts now on behalf of pacit thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to routing Concepts part two today I'm going to be talking about routing metrics routing aggregation and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on high availability we have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about routing metrics it is quite common for there to be more than one route available to a remote Network routing protocols use metrics to determine which route is the best route to reach those remote networks each routing protocol will use its own set of metrics in determining which routes to which networks are placed in its routing table the same basic metric may be used by different routing protocols but when this occurs the metric is usually implemented in a different manner through the use of different algorithms the first metric that we're going to discuss is the hop count the hop count is the number of routers between two end points this is determined from the center router's perspective the maximum transmission unit or MTU is another metric that is used by routing protocols the MTU is the maximum allowed size of a packet measured in bytes that's allowed through an interface the standard MTU for ethernet is 1,500 bytes packets that exceed the MTU must be fragmented into smaller pieces leading leading to more packets leading to a slower connection bandwidth is another common routing metric bandwidth is a measure of the speed of the network connection the speed is commonly measured in either kilobits per second megabits per second or gigabits per second another common metric is latency latency is a measure of time that a packet takes to Traverse a length when latency is implemented by routing protocols the total amount of latency or delay to go in to end between two points is what is used in the metric the administrative distance or add is probably the most important metric that's used on routers the administrative distance is the believability of a routing protocol's advertised routes different routing Protocols are considered to be more believable or trustworthy than others routers use the ad to help determine which routing protocol to use when more than one protocol is installed on the router the lowest ad of an advertised route will determine the protocol that's used there are some common standard administrative distance first up is the directly connected route that's a direct link between two routers that has an ad of zero and it is the most believable or trustworthy of routes next is the statically configured route it has an ad of One external border Gateway protocol has an ad of 20 it's still fairly trustworthy internal eigrp has an ad of 90 it's not as trustworthy as BG GP but it is more trustworthy than ospf open shortest path first which has an ad of 110 Isis has an ad of 115 so not quite as believable as ospf but more believable than rip which has an ad of 120 external eigrp has an ad of 170 and internal bgp and I've never seen internal bgp used has an ad of 200 now if you see an administrative distance of 255 that means that that route is not believable at all as a side note the ad can be set by an administrator so if you are running both ospf and Isis on a router but you want Isis to be used you could actually set osf's ad to a higher number than Isis and then Isis would always be used before ospf now let's move on to Route aggregation without some mechanism put in place routing tables would soon become very large and highly inefficient through careful Planning Network administrators use a process called route aggregation to condense the sign of routing tables they do so through the use of classless interdomain routing CER to summarize routes to different networks route aggregation is common in networking let's take a look at an example of Route aggregation suppose we have a router that has the following networks on its serial 0/1 interface it has 10.1.1 024 known on that interface 10.1.1 17.0 sl24 101320 sl24 and 10.1.1 128.0 sl24 all of those networks are known to that interface that S01 interface these routes are what are known as contiguous routes they're all in a line they can be summarized or aggregated by a common cider entry in the routing table they could all be summarized by the following entry 10.1.0 sl16 now there is a warning about route aggregation route aggregation takes careful planning during the network design phase that above example would not work if the serial interface 1/1 on on that same router was connected to network 10.1.2 sl24 because that new network makes those networks on on the 01 interface noncontiguous networks All the known networks are no longer all in a road this leads to the fact that the routes could no longer be aggregated or summarized let's conclude with a discussion on high availability part of a network administrator's job is to ensure that networks remain up and active for the maximum amount of time in an effort to ensure that networks don't go down administrators often remove single points of failure a single point of failure in a network is the point where a single failure will cause the network to cease functioning Network administrators often use high availability techniques in order to remove those single points of failure an example of a high availability technique is the use of redundant links to outside networks hot standby router protocol hsrp is a specific example of a high availability technique hsrp is a proprietary Cisco method of creating a fault tolerant link using two or more routers with connections outside of the local subnet the two routers are connected together as well as having connections outside of the local network a virtual IP address is created and shared between the two routers devices on the network are configured to use that virtual IP address as their default gateway for packets leaving the network if a single router goes down the link outside of the network is still available another high availability technique is Virtual Router redundancy protocol vrp it is an ietf internet engineering task force standard that is similar in operation to hsrp that concludes this session on the introduction to routing Concepts part two I discussed some routing metrics then I moved on to Route aggregation and I concluded with a brief discussion on high availability on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to routing protocols today we're going to be talking talking about some of the differences between interior and exterior Gateway routing protocols we will introduce some more routing Concepts and then we will end with routing protocols in themselves there's a whole lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session let's begin with a comparison between interior and exterior Gateway protocols interior Gateway protocols or igps are a category of protocols used within autonomous networks autonomous networks are networks that you control or that are under the control of a single organization the most popular igp Protocols are OSF open shortest path first and rip version two that's routing information protocol version two now there is a special mention here and that's Isis which is intermediate system to intermediate system Isis is popular with extremely large autonomous networks like an isps or internet service providers Network exterior Gateway protocols on the other hand are a category of protocols used between nonautonomous networks so egps are used between Networks that are controlled by different organizations or entities the most popular EGP protocol is border Gateway protocol now it's not uncommon for organizations to have more than one network that they are routing traffic between these are called autonomous networks some igp routing protocols use an administrator defined autonomous system number or as number as one means of identifying which networks can directly communicate with each other the autonomous system number is not a metric but a means of identifying a network that might possibly accept another Network's traffic something to remember is that the as is only significant within autonomous networks and has no relevance outside of them now let's move on to more routing Concepts routing protocols can be classified by how they perform their routing interior Gateway and EGP routing protocols can be broken out into three other categories of protocols which is designated by their main method of determining routes between networks the first class of routing Protocols are distance Vector routing protocols with distant Vector routing protocols the the routes are determined by by how many routers exist between the source and the destination the efficiency of the links in the selected route is not taken into consideration with distance Vector protocols periodically the whole routing table is broadcast out onto the network then there are link state routing protocols metrics are used to determine the best possible route between destinations doesn't really matter how many hops there are once the route has been established these protocols then only monitor the state of directly connected links and only make changes to their routing tables when changes to the links occur with link state routing protocols only changes in link status are broadcasted and finally there are hybrid routing protocols these use aspects of both the distance vector and Link state routing protocol let's talk about the next hop the next hop is the next router in the path between two points the next hop is often designated by an interface address of the device that is receiving the data or by that router's name or by that router's location the routing table is the database table that is used by a router to determine the best possible route between two points different routing protocols use different algorithms to place routes in the routing table the next concept is Convergence convergence can be thought of as steady state convergence is measured in the amount of time that it takes all of the routers in an autonomous system to learn all of the possible routes within that system faster convergence times hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic elements of unified Communications today I'm going to be talking about unified Communications and then I'm going to move on to some unified communication Concepts and then I'm going to end with voice over IP and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I will begin this session by talking about Unified communication now unified Communications is not encompassed by a single product or device it's a growing category in the Enterprise Network unified communication or UC is the set of products and services that attempts to provide a consistent single user interface and experience across different media types and different devices UC allows a user to send a message from one type of media as an email and have that media received as a different type of media that email could become a text message or a voicemail so now let's talk about some unified communication devices first up is the UC server these are specialized servers which quite often are virtual in nature that are designed to implement unified communication solution Solutions in the workplace the UC servers work in conjunction with UC gateways a UC Gateway is a network device that is designed to translate between different signaling methods as in a voice over IP Gateway which will translate an analog public switched telephone Network voice signal into a signal that can be understood on the VoIP Network there are some other UC devices any device that can be used in the implementation of a unified communication solution is considered a UC device they may include but are not limited to VoIP phones email systems video conferencing systems and instant messaging networks now let's move on to some unified Communications Concepts the first concept that we're going to discuss is presence now presence is an indicator that is used to communicate the willingness or ability of a user to accept communication common presence statuses include available online offline busy and do not disturb present services are an important service provided in UC Solutions as they will track the individual users across multiple devices and networks in real time through the use of multicast Transmissions once a communication session has been established multicast communication is dropped and unicast network Transmissions are used another UC concept that you need to grasp is quality of service quality of service techniques are implemented to improve unified communication by managing Network traffic the most common implementation of quality of service is class of service cosos cosos is a quality of service technique that's used to manage Network traffic by grouping similar types of traffic and assigning a network priority to that traffic as in unified communication traffic is given a higher priority than email a sixbit differentiated service code point dscp is used in the IP header to establish the cosos or class of service now let's move on to voice over IP VoIP is one of the most common implementations in a unified Communications solution through the use of a present service calls can be routed to the correct location for where the user is at two important protocols used in voice over IP are session initiation protocol Sip and realtime transport protocol RTP sip has two purposes first it is used to establish a communication session between two endpoints the other purpose is that once the session is completed sip tears down that connection between the two end points during the communication session RTP is used as the transport call helping to provide that quality of service through cosos to the endpoints now that concludes this session on the basic elements of unified communication I talked about unified Communications then I moved on to some unified communication Concepts and I concluded with a brief discussion on voice over IP now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on virtualization Technologies today I'm going to be discussing the difference between a hypervisor and virtual machine manager then I'm going to move on to components of virtualization and then I'm going to have a brief discussion on softwar defined networking I have a whole lot of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with hypervisors and virtual machine managers so what is the difference between a hypervisor and a virtual machine manager the difference could be nothing or the difference could be everything some people use the term hypervisor very broadly they use it to refer to any of the software that is used to manage virtual machines others will differentiate between the two terms in this way a hypervisor does not need a host operating system while a virtual machine manager or vmm requires a host operating system such as Microsoft Windows Apple OS X or a Linux operating system well the hypervisor can operate as its own operating system with that covered let's talk about some of the components of virtualization first up is the virtual desktop a virtual desktop is a virtual machine or VM that functions as a desktop now any modern operating system can be run inside of a VM desktop multiple virtual desktops may be hosted on or from a single host system then there are virtual servers which surprisingly is a virtual machine that functions as a server any modern server operating system can be used in a virtual server environment multiple virtual servers may be hosted on or from a single host guess what there are then virtual switches firewalls and routers these are virtual machines that fulfill the functions of the switch firewall and router router virtual firewalls and routers are particularly effective when they're combined with virtual network interface controllers or virtual Nicks and virtual switches to create virtual networks speaking of virtual networks an important consideration for when designing a virtual network is how that virtual network is going to pass traffic to remote networks or networks outside of the host system virtual ization by its nature leads to either an open and highly scalable Network or a closed selfcontained system it is possible to create a completely selfcontained network with all of the virtual components and never have Network traffic leave the host machine but if there is a desire or need for that Network traffic to pass beyond the host system then that function needs to be specifically granted a connection must be created between the host systems physical Nick and the virtual networking equipment to allow Network traffic to pass through the physical host system next up softwar defined networking softwar defined networking or sdn is the process of allowing the administration and configuration of a network to be done dynamically with s the end the administrator uses a frontend program to make adjustments to the network this program sends the instructions to the networking equipment which is then reconfigured to perform as the administrator desires sdn can allow Network administrators to dynamically adjust Network performance without the need to log into each individual device that needs to be adjusted to achieve the desired performance sdn is considered to still be an emerging technology but sdn also works well for virtual networks and cloud computing now that concludes this session on virtualization technology I talked about hypervisors and virtual machine managers then I moved on to a brief discussion on some components of virtualization and I concluded with another brief discussion on softwar defined networking on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on storage area networks today I'm going to discuss the justification for storage area networks and then I'm going to talk about storage area Network Technology and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with justifications for storage area networks there have been several factors that have led to the increased demand for data storage one of them has been the dramatic decrease in the actual cost of data storage it actually costs us less now for storage on a per gigabyte basis than it has in the past what has happened is that as the cost of storage has decreased the demand for storage has increased dramatically businesses are now generating an analyzing huge amounts of data in an effort to create a competitive Advantage think big data I'm sure you've heard about Big Data recently or this increase in data collection has led to an increased demand for storage capacity another factor is that as the demand for data has increased it has needed to be more available which means that there has been a need to be able to access that data from anywhere and the accessibility is needed to be increased as well including from nonstandard devices a storage area network or san can be a solution to the need for both storage capacity and high availability there are several advantages to the storage area network first off is scalability the amount of data that is being generated today is huge this has led to a need to store that data the sand is more scalable than other options as your storage needs increase the capacity of the sand can be easily increased to meet that storage need then there's dat data availability the demand has also increased for that data to be available at any time from anywhere and a sand can play a vital role in creating that accessibility one of the most popular implementations of a sand is to deploy it as part of a cloud computing solution this increases the availability of that data that's being stored on the sand and finally there's optimization as the requirements to store data are removed from application servers those servers can then be optimized to run those applications much more efficiently at the same time data storage is also optimized it's time now to discuss some San technology the storage area network or san and the network attached storage or NZ often get confused with one another but they are different the sand is an actual network of devices that have the sole purpose of storing data efficiently on the other hand the NZ is a specifically designed Network appliance that has been configured to store data more efficiently than standard storage methods the difference is that a NZ is a data storage appliance that is placed on a network while a San is a network data storage devices it is not uncommon for a San to contain multiple NZ devices with all of that data storage capabilities several technologies have been developed to ease the transmission of that data the first one that we're going to discuss is fiber channel or FC fiber channel is a highe network technology that was originally developed to operate over fiber optic cables only since its introduction the standards have been modified to allow the use of copper cabling in conjunction with fiber optic cabling fiber channel is commonly used to connect to Sands when fiber channel is implemented it uses the fiber channel protocol or FCP as its transport protocol to transmit scuzzy commands so it transmits small computer system interface commands to storage devices as in the nas appliances so a San implements FCP as opposed to TCP as its transport protocol when fiber channel is used another technology that was developed was internet scuzzy or I scuzzy I scuzzy is an IP based networking standard that is used to connect data storage facilities and Sands I scuzzy allows for scuzzy commands and processes to take place over longer distances than the original scuzzy implementation jumbo frames are also allowed within the San environment jumbo frames allow for greater throughput of data by allowing up to 9,000 bytes of data to be in a single frame this can greatly increase the efficiency of a sand as a comparison the standard frame on an Ethernet Network can only be a maximum of 1,500 bytes now that concludes this session on storage area networks I talked about the justification for storage area networks and then I concluded with a brief discussion on some San technology on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic Cloud Concepts today we're going to be talking about Cloud classifications and then we will conclude with different types of cloud computing there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and Dive Right In I will begin our session with a discussion about Cloud classifications cloud computing is where the resources on the network are not actually physical in nature they are provided to the enduser virtually cloud computing can lead to a very fluid and dynamic environment as the required resources are normally only provisioned or supplied as needed and are decommissioned or shut down once their use is is done most often these virtual resources are not owned by the company or user that uses them but are provided by a service provider while cloud computing is highly configurable and changeable it does have some basic structures that are used in the classification of the type of cloud that is in use the first classification of cloud computing that we're going to talk about is the public cloud this is where systems can interact with services and devices within the public cloud and on public networks like over the internet and possibly with other public clouds the public cloud is where the services that are provided are not just provided to a specific user but are open for the public to purchase and use then there are private clouds this is where systems only communicate with with services and devices within a specific private Cloud a private cloud is essentially just that private the only users who have access to it are ones who are authorized to use it the cloud classification can be hybrid it can combine aspects of both the public and private clouds and last up there are Community clouds this is where cloud services are used by private individuals organizations or groups that have a common interest now let's move on to different types of cloud computing because of the nature of cloud computing it is very configurable to the needs and desires of the purchaser of the cloud services purchasers have many options beyond the type of cloud services that they want to provision they must also determine what type of service they are going to require from the most basic of services to the most highly complex of services the purchaser needs to have a plan going into cloud computing in order for it to be efficient and effective for them so now let's move on to some of those services that cloud computing can offer first up is software as a service the enduser purchases the rights to use an application or software without the need to configure the virtual servers that will deliver the application to them it is usually delivered as a web app or web application opened and used from within a web browser but not always if you have a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 you are utilizing software as a service then there is platform as a service or paas the user is provided with a development platform platform for the creation of software packages without the need to configure the virtual servers and the infrastructure that delivers it you are essentially renting server or computing power in order to develop your software packages paas is more complex than software as a service and finally we have infrastructure as a service this is where the enduser is provided with access to Virtual servers configurable by the customer and other virtual network resources their infrastructure is actually virtually provided to them this creates a highly configurable environment in which customers can create the resources and the performance that they require the enduser supplies the software that's going to be used on the IAS Network or they purchase it as an additional software as a service service as you could have guessed from that last statement it's not uncommon for the type of cloud computing being utilized by an organization to be a mix some departments May rely upon and use infrastructure as a service while the development team will only utilize a platform as a service service part of the advantage of cloud computing is that the purchaser only needs to initialize and pay for resources as they are needed in a private Cloud situation it is possible for an organization that is using it to actually own the cloud resources if they do own the cloud resources they may have it on site or they may pay to have those resources hosted off site that way they can offload the maintenance cost of maintaining those resources now that concludes this session on basic Cloud Concepts I talked about different Cloud classifications and then I concluded with a brief discussion on types of cloud computing now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on implementing a basic Network today we're going to discuss plan the network and then configure the network there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session of course I'm going to begin with plan the network so you need a simple small office home office Network create just plug two PCS into a single Hub and you have a very basic network but doesn't it achieve what you want how do you know if you don't have a plan a network plan is vital when implementing any network more complicated than the most very basic of networks that plan should cover what you are hoping to achieve and how you are going to get there in addition to your expertise you are also going to need input from your end users nothing is quite so frustrating as to delivering the network that you've planned and built and having the customer tell you that it is not what they wanted or needed let's talk about that Network plan in a little bit more detail the first thing that you should do is create a list of requirements now in order to make that list you need to Define why the network is needed that will help you to Define what network features are required then you need to Define the scope or size of the network once you have those they will help to establish a budget to implement that Network once you know why the network is needed and what features are required then you can work on network design in network design you need to determine what equipment is needed to implement that Network part of the design is also how the network will be organized and how shared resources will be placed on the network when you're planning the network something that you should also consider are compatibility issues you need to know what standards are in use now and what standards will there be in the future included in those compatibility issues are does any current equipment that is required need specific cabling or connectors in order to be installed that is something that often gets overlooked your Network plan also needs to deal with network cabling runs your internal connections how many node connections will be required and where how will you plan for future expansion that future expansion is more than likely going to require more internal connections you should build in some tolerance for future expansion then you need to consider external connections how will the network connect to the outside where will that Wan connection come into your building and where will your equipment be placed so that it can reach those Wan connections that is also part of the network equipment placement plan part of that plan also needs to consider if there is a wiring or equipment closet and where it's going to be located if you do have a wiring or equipment closet are there environmental considerations about placing the equipment in there is it too hot is it too cold is it too hum humid or is it too dry you need to think about those things when you're placing your network equipment your plan should also cover how Network Security will be implemented Are there specific types of firewall and placement considerations for those firewalls will virtual local area networks be required and if so how many also how will your switch Port security be implemented all of these go into a successful Network plan now let's talk about configuring the network here are some network configuration considerations for you first up how will your clients receive their Internet Protocol addresses their IP addresses using static IP address configuration creates a higher level of security but it's harder to manage you could use Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses from a preconfigured pool but your security may be a little bit lower if you do so if you do use DHCP you might want to consider using Mac filtering Mac filtering will only allow specified Mac addresses that physical burned in address onto the network it is an effective security measure but kind of like static IP addressing it can be difficult to control and manage especially as the network grows something else to consider is that if a server will be hosted on the network that needs to be accessed from outside of that Network as in you're hosting a web server then you're going to need a demilitarized zone a DMZ the DMZ is an area of the network in which outside connections are allowed while the internal Network remains protected from that outside traffic a DMZ will require a custom configuration of the firewall in most implementations two firewalls are used but it's not necessary to use two firewalls talking about firewalls firewall placement and configuration considerations are next most small office home office Wan connection devices as in their cable modems are DSL modems include firewall service that are sufficient in most cases for those small simple networks but if a DMZ needs to be deployed the best method is to introduce an additional router in firewall into the network with the DMC residing between the WAN equipment and the new router firewall combination another aspect of deploying a DMZ is that port forwarding should also be used at the router firewall level port forwarding is used to direct requests for specific resources like a request for a web page to the computer that has the resource let's move on to wireless network configuration considerations the first thing to consider in a wireless network is the name of the wireless network that's the service set identifier the SSID now the SSID can be set to broadcast in the clear alternatively the SSID can be set for the broadcast to be hidden some people consider hiding the SSID broadcast as a security measure but it really doesn't work that way it doesn't stop the broadcast it only hides the broadcast a packet sniffer can easily see those broadcasts and those broadcast packets can be easily interpreted so hiding the SSID is not an effective security measure but it does make things a little bit more difficult the next aspect of wireless network configuration that you need to consider is encryption first off I will say you need to have encryption on your wireless network not only that but you need to turn it on by default wireless routers and wireless access points waps do not have encryption enabled and at the minimum your encryption type should could be WPA2 personal that's at the minimum some wireless network equipment comes with a service that is called Wii protected setup WPS and if it does it's enabled by default this should be turned off and not used as it creates a weakness in the wireless network why is that well because WPS can be easily exploited by an attacker the network that you implement may not be exactly what you planned so document any changes to the plan undoubtedly during the process of implementing that plan some changes will be introduced some by you and some By Request of the end user always document those changes to the plan and have the end user sign off on them then be sure to incorporate those changes into the final Network documentation now that concludes this session on implementing a basic Network I talked about plan the network and then I talked about configure the network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it T's session on analyzing monitoring reports today I'm going to talk about Baseline reports and then I'm going to move on to just reports in general I have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into this session and of course I'm going to begin by talking about baselines how do you know what constitutes good Network performance and what indicates that an issue is about to happen this is where Baseline documentation comes into play Baseline documentation provides a snapshot of the network when it is running efficiently at least hopefully when it's running efficiently baselines are usually kept as a log file at the minimum baselines should be established on CPU utilization and network bandwidth utilization you may also basemark other functions as you deem them to be relevant Network administrators should perform periodic tests against the Baseline to check to see if the Baseline is changed they will change over time and in order for Network administrators to know what constitutes good performance on their Network their baselines need to be current you can use Window performance monitor to help establish the baselines for your network let's talk about some of the items that should be considered for Baseline reports first up is Network device CPU utilization knowing the CPU utilization on a piece of equipment can help to determine when a network device is going to fail if your CPU utilization is constantly at 100% you know there's a problem that problem may be that it's going to fail or it may be that you need to install more network devices to take care of a growing network but you won't really know that if you're not baselining the CPU utilization Network device memory utilization should also be baselined it can help to determine when it is time to expand the memory of a network device a good item for baselining is bandwidth utilization this can help to determine the overall health of a network it can help to determine when Network segmentation should occur it can also help to determine if a network device is about to fail particularly if it's creating a storm of data Baseline utilization reports can help identifying when a security breach has occurred you might want to consider baselining your storage device utilization this can help to determine when storage utilization has become a bottleneck on the network where your storage device is actually causing the network to slow down because there's too much data being pushed into it which means that baselining your storage utilization can help determine when to increase the storage capacity of that Network you might also want to Baseline your wireless Channel utilization this can help to determine how saturated the wireless channels have become once it's been determined that your wireless channels are saturated a new wireless access point can be installed to alleviate the pressure and then you need to create a new Baseline for wireless Channel utilization this Baseline can also help to determine if there is unauthorized wireless access occurring on your wireless network especially if there is utilization on a channel that is not supposed to have any utilization now let's move on to analyzing reports before we talk about analyzing reports let's talk about log file management log files can accumulate data quickly and unfortunately some administrators only review log files after a major problem has occurred in most situations this is a case of too much information at the wrong time good administrators will set the proper reporting levels with their logging software they won't be logging all that debug information that level seven information unless of course they're actively debugging a system or application good administrators will review log files and compare them against their Baseline documentation they do this to find issues while the issues are still minor and before they become major log files should also be kept and archived in case there is a need for historical data when you do archive your log files you should follow the organization's data storage policy so something to consider is that you may want to create running graphs of important metrics that are captured by log files graphing the data gives a quick visual reference making it easier to spot issues and Trends many logging applications give the administrator the option of creating those graphs easily and quickly but then again they don't do you any good if you don't review them on a regular basis if you're having an issue with a router or link one of the first things that you want to do is you want to run an interface report now hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network monitoring part one today we're going to be talking about the why of monitoring and then we're going to talk about tools to monitor the network there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session I'm going to begin with the why of network monitoring how do you know what is going on in your network is it healthy or is it about to crash Network administrators really hate to be surprised by failures in their networks especially ones that could have been foreseen and therefore kept from happening how do they keep from being surprised well they enact a plethora of procedures and tools to monitor their networks and to keep track of how those networks are behaving they do this to reduce the surprise element now that we've covered the why of network monitoring let's talk about tools that you can use to monitor the network one of the main tools that Network administrators use to monitor their networks are log files all operating systems offer a means of viewing events that occur to that specific machine that also includes networking equipment there have been some applications that have been developed to monitor systems and networks that also generate log files among other actions that they can take log files can be used to help pinpoint when a problem occurred and to help narrow down the possible causes of that problem log files can also be used to help create a baseline of network Behavior so that you know what to expect from your network log files can usually be classified as being systems logs General logs or history logs as a general rule log files are an after Thea means of monitoring the network and they're not very good at realtime analysis that's partially due due to the sheer amount of information that log files can generate it's just too difficult to keep track of that in real time now let's talk about some specific logging tools that you can use the first one that I'm going to talk about is Event Viewer it's not really a log file in itself it comes with Windows server in most other Windows operating systems and this tool can be used to review Windows log files the most important log files that you can view from Event Viewer are application security and systems logs application logs contain events that are triggered by the actions of an application for example if you have live update enabled it will create log entries based on actions taken by live update then there are security logs these contain events that are triggered by security events for example some logs are created for successful and unsuccessful log on attempts then there are systems logs these contain events triggered by Windows systems components for example it will create an entry for when a driver starts or fails to start in either situation a log entry will be created now let's talk about a non Microsoft log and that would be CIS log CIS log was developed in the 1980s and it provides devices that normally would not be able to communicate with a means of delivering performance and problem information to systems administrators this permits there to be separation between the software that generates the message the storage of that message and the software that analyzes the generated message this separation of function allows CIS log to be highly configurable and has allowed it to continue to be a vital tool for monitoring networks even today as a matter of fact the internet engineering task force the ietf lik CIS log so much that they standardized it in 2009 CIS log can generate log messages based on the types of services that are running and it includes a severity level that rang is from zero the most severe up through seven the least severe CIS log can generate a lot of log messages most Network administrators configure it so that they only get alerted when a minimum severity level has been reached as a matter of fact you almost never want to capture debug log events unless you are actively debugging an application or service just because it generates so much information CIS log can be configured so that Network administrators receive their alerts via text message or SMS message or by email or they may even receive a voicemail message well CIS log is a cool tool it's not the only one that's out there there's also simple Network management protocol SNMP SNMP is an application layer protocol used to Monitor and manage a Network Health Network or systems administrators configure monitors these are often called traps on devices that view the operation of a specific item as in is that router's interface up or is that router's interface down the monitors periodically communicate with a network management station or nms through git messages that's G messages that the nms send out the response from the monitors is stored in a management information base or Mi which is a type of log file the administrator can custom configure the monitors with set messages sent from the network management station when an event occurs as in the interface goes down the Trap is tripped and the event is logged SNMP just like CIS log can be configured to just log the event or it can be configured to contact the network administrator SNMP gives Network and systems administrators the ability to provide more realtime monitoring of a Network's performance and health then there's security information and event management cm it's a term for software products and services that combine security information management or Sim and security event management Sam S may be provided by a software package a network Appliance or as a thirdparty cloud service it is used as a means of monitoring and providing realtime analysis of security alerts that is an example of the security event management function the Sim function it can also be used as a tool to analyze longterm data in log files that's an example of the Sim function or the security information management function s can be highly configured to the needs of the individual Network now that concludes this session on network monitoring part one I talked about the why of network monitoring and then I briefly touched on some tools for monitoring the network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace's session on network monitoring part two today we're going to be talking about Active network monitoring tools then I'm going to move on to wireless monitoring tools and we're going to conclude with environmental monitoring we have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Active network monitoring tools Port scanners are used to scan a network for open ports and protocols the information that a port scanner gathers is Vital Information if you want to harden the network Port scanners are a great method of finding vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure allowing the network administrator to plug those vulnerabilities before before they become a security breach I do have to issue a word of caution you should only use a port scanner on a network or system that you are authorized to scan Port scanning is a possible sign of someone trying to breach a system and can lead to problems if you're not authorized to scan that system you don't want to have to try and explain to an information security specialist while you were scanning their network if you're not authorized to scan it a little bit different than a port scanner are applications that use interface monitoring or packet flow monitoring these are usually deployed as an active software tool to Monitor and analyze Network traffic within a network segment they're commonly called packet sniffers or protocol analyzers they allow for an indepth look at what traffic is on the network and may reveal security issues that the network administrator can then mitigate they help to identify top talkers on a network segment top talkers are those nodes or applications that generate the most amount of traffic packet sniffers can help to identify top listeners on a network segment a top listener is that interface or the interfaces that are receiving the most Network traffic or put another way those interfaces that are utilizing the most bandwidth for receiving packets this can help an administrator when they have determined that load balancing might be needed on the network Microsoft message analyzer and Wireshark are examples of free packet flow monitoring tools now let's move on to wireless monitoring tools and we're going to begin with the Wifi Analyzer a WiFi analyzer is a similar tool to a protocol analyzer but only for wireless networks it sniffs out packets on wireless networks and gives you statistics on those packets that it sees it can check for bandwidth usage Channel usage top talkers top listeners Etc just like a packet sniffer can WiFi analyzers can also identify networks by passively scanning the radio frequencies to determine where traffic is coming from given enough time a WiFi analyzer can also identify hidden networks are those that you don't know about a WiFi analyzer can also infer non beaconing networks Based on data traffic over the radio frequencies they may not be able to discover the SSID but they can tell the network administrator that something is passing traffic there another type of Wireless monitoring tool Are Wireless survey tools they're most commonly used as a design tool for setting up highquality wireless networks when used in conjunction with mapping tools the survey tools can help to establish the required amount of access points to get the proper amount of coverage the ideal antenna placement and the optimum amount of Channel overlap Wireless survey tools can also help to identify possible sources of radio frequency interference or RF I Wireless survey tools are often used to eliminate wireless network performance and security issues before they ever have a chance to occur let's move on to environmental monitoring a Network's Health can be affected by more than just a network interface failing or a possible security breach Network and systems administrators also need to be concerned about environmental factors some of those factors include the quality and quantity of electrical power being supplied to their equipment and the amount of heat in the rooms that equipment is kept and also with that the humidity level power monitoring tools are systems and tools that can be used to evaluate the amount of and the quality of the electrical power being delivered to the system they're often deployed with or alongside an uninterruptible power supply or UPS the monitor will issue an alert when an issue with electrical power has been identified giving the network or system administrator a chance to rectify the problem before any equipment has been damaged all electrical components are designed to operate within a specific heat range not only are they designed to operate within that heat range but all electrical equipment will generate some heat while they're in operation and the the harder that Equipment Works the more heat they will generate this is where heat monitors come into play the Heat monitor allows an administrator to control the temperature levels before they become an issue humidity is another item that Network administrators need to keep in mind too little humidity increases the risk of electrostatic discharge or ESD but too much humidity increases the risk of condensation on equipment and your electrical components do not like that condensation humidity monitors allow administrators the ability to control the humidity level through the proper means before it becomes an issue now that concludes this session on network monitoring part two I talked about Active network monitoring tools then I moved on to some Wireless monitoring tools and I concluded with a brief discussion on Environmental monitoring on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on supporting configuration management part one today I'm going to be talking about what configuration management is and then I'm going to discuss some documentation with that let's go ahead and jump into this session first up is configuration management why do we need configuration management because even fairly small modern networks can get very complex very fast configuration management or cm is a discipline that is used to evaluate coordinate approve deny or Implement change in or to an IT system configuration management plays a vital role in any network beyond the most simplistic of small office home office networks it helps to ensure that the network runs efficiently and smoothly Network administrators and support staff will play a vital role in developing and implementing any CM system or process now that you know what configuration management is let's talk about documentation documentation plays a key role in any configuration management system that gets developed in the CM process documentation is used to help evaluate and plan proposed changes documentation is also used to help in Asset Management network maintenance and vendor evaluations the documentation that is created will depend upon the complexity of the systems under consideration however even if your organization doesn't Implement a true CM sty some documentation should still be kept to reduce the burden on network personnel and to ease administrative management of the network some of the documentation that should be kept include policies and procedures policies are a set of guidelines that establish how the network is to be configured and operated they also set the expected behavior of the people within the organization as a general rule policies are put into effect at the mid to upper management level procedures on the other hand are a set of documents that detail how the policies are to be implemented as a general rule procedures are set by the management of the level that's affected by the policy and they get down to the stepbystep process of how to do things Asset Management documentation should also be maintained this covers a broad category of documentation that's often used to help in the change management process Asset Management documentation contains detailed information on what assets are present it also includes the maintenance history for those assets this documentation is often used to help track update and upgrade Cycles physical Network diagrams should also be kept these are a map or diagram of all network devices and how they connect a physical Network diagram specifies the cabling connectors and physical cabling runs it will also include Cable Management documentation which is considered a subcategory of the physical Network diagram the cabling management documentation will contain a wiring scheme which establishes the type of cabling and the connectors used it also defines the allowed standards for wiring those cables your documentation should also include a logical Network diagram it's similar to a physical Network diagram but more detailed it provides details on the IP address scheme active ports protocols that are allowed on the network etc etc your logical Network diagram also details connected networks so what local area networks are present or which virtual local area networks are present so on and so forth part of your logical Network diagram also details IP address utilization IP address utilization can greatly affect the efficiency and performance of the network by allowing you to know which lands or VLS have space on which nodes can be added your physical and logical Network diagrams may be combined into a single document vendor documentation also plays a role in supporting configuration management it covers a broad category of documentation that can include the approved vendor list the vendor approval process and purchase order documentation there are some common vendor documents that you should know first up is the memorandum of understanding or mou this is an agreement between two or more organizations that detail how those organizations are to take some common course of action it is also often referred to as a letter of intent it is not legally binding but it does often lead towards a binding agreement then there is the statement of work or the S so the S it's a detailed document that specifies what work is to be performed the expected outcome or deliverables and the timelines to perform the work the statement of work is often a key document in Project man management included in some vendor documentation is a master license agreement or MLA this is a legal agreement between two entities in which one agrees to pay the other for the use of a specific piece of software or software package for a specific period of time often instead of being called a master license agreement it is referred to as just a licens agreement last up is the service level agreement or SLA it details the allowable amount of response time the vendor has to resolve an issue or problem most commonly it is associated with a service contract that concludes this session on supporting configuration management part one I talked about configuration management and then I moved on to documentation on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pacit session on supporting configuration management part two today I'm going to be talking about backups and then we will conclude with a brief discussion on bring your own device and with that let's go ahead and begin this session I will be Begin by talking about backups backups are an essential part of any configuration management system that's because small changes in a network devic's configuration can introduce unexpected consequences into that Network in addition there is always the possibility of a failure of a key component which can lead to the loss of data or functionality backups play a key role in recovering from unexpected consequences or from the failure of a key component backup schedules must be implemented and periodic tests should be conducted to ensure that the backup process is working there's nothing worse than installing a backup and finding out that you really backed up nothing there are three basic types of backups there is the full backup all data on the targeted system is backed up this is the slowest backup method method with the highest storage requirements but it does lead to the fastest recovery method when recovering using a full backup it only requires the last full backup file then there's the incremental backup with this type only new or modified files are backed up this is the fastest backup method with the lowest storage requirements but it also leads to the slowest recovery method the recovery process with incremental backups requires the last full backup file in all of the incremental backup files the middle ground is the differential backup only data that is changed since the last full backup is saved the time to back up is moderate and it requires a moderate amount of storage but it also is the middle ground on the length of time for Recovery the recovery process requires the last full backup file and the last differential backup file something else that needs to be backed up are your configuration files of network devices once a network device has been configured and it's operating as expected a backup of the configuration files and operating system should be done this helps to speed up the recovery time in cases of equipment failure or when a change to the configuration has introduced unexpected consequences having the configuration file backups on hand means that you don't need to manually input it to recover in these situations now let's move on to bring your own device BYOD policies or bring your own device policies allow employees to use their own personal devices on an organization's Network while the employees are happy that they get to use their favorite it devices on the corporate Network it departments aren't quite as happy about it why it departments are tasked with keeping a network safe yet they have very little control over the devices that employees bring in in some cases bring your own device policies have led to the introduction of malware into an organization's Network environment this makes them very unhappy they can Implement Network admission control measures or Knack measures in an effort to reduce the risk associated ated with BYOD policies and to introduce configuration management to those devices Network admission control is a Cisco process Microsoft uses a similar process but it's called network access protection or nap while their names may be different they still function in the same way Knack includes more than just authenticating users and devices on the network all of the devices that are requesting access to network resources are screened for the type of device that it is the operating system that's used including any updates that are present neack will also check for security software making sure that it's up to date Knack can also check for the presence of malware or other security vulnerabilities in an advanced setup if the device requesting the connection has been rejected the device is then redirected to a remediation server which attempts to resolve the known issues so if the security software is out of date the remediation server may try and bring it up to date and then allow that device to connect to the corporate Network that concludes this session on supporting configuration management part two I talked about backups and we concluded with a brief discussion on bring your own device on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the importance of network segmentation today we're going to discuss the OSI model and segmentation and then we're going to conclude with reasons for segmentation and with that let's go ahead and begin this session we will Begin by talking about the OSI model and segmentation so what is segmentation well it's taking a single Network or system and breaking it into smaller discrete units this can be achieved physically or logically there are many reasons why you might want to segment a network some of them could include to ease a administrative tasks to achieve performance gains to increase security or to comply with regulations as I mentioned earlier segmenting a network can be achieved physically or logically and either way it involves different levels of the OSI reference model it can be achieved at layer one the physical layer this is taking a single Network and making it into more than one network through the use of cable runs and Equipment this is the most extreme example of network segmentation not only is this the most extreme example of segmentation but it's also an example of physically segmenting a network you can also segment a network logically at the data link layer which is Layer Two or at the network layer which is layer three of the OSI model this is taking a single Network and making it into more than one by logically dividing the network The Logical segmentation of a network takes the least amount of physical resources to achieve it now let's move on to reasons for segmentation first up is compliance some rules and regulations require that certain data be kept separate and secure as in the payment card industry data security standard or PCI DSS this requires that you keep customer information separate and secure from normal business information segmentation allows for the regulated data to flow across its own network keeping it more secure another reason for segmentation would be for Network performance optimization as a network increases in size the amount of data that flows through them usually increases this can slow down the performance of the network segmentation breaks the larger Network into smaller units which can lead to an increase in performance on those segments related to network performance optimization is the creating of high performance networks some applications require more bandwidth in order to perform at the desired higher level Voiceover IP video teleconferencing and media Nets which are all examples of streaming services all perform better when they are on their own network segments a a major reason for Network segmentation is to separate private from public networks organizations often allow the public to access the internet from their locations these are places that offer free WiFi segmentation allows this traffic to be kept separate from the private corporate traffic then there are Legacy systems some organizations use systems that are considered critical to their operation but are not capable of residing on Modern networks segmentation allows the Legacy system to reside on its own subnet and network without compromising its performance or the performance of the rest of the network then there are testing Labs the lab can be used to test new applications operating systems update patches so on and so forth if these tests occur on the main Network it is possible that this testing could inject a problem into the main system segmentation allows for the testing to occur in a secure easily controllable environment and finally their security one of the main reasons for performing Network segmentation is for security purposes segmentation allows Network and systems administrators to more easily control the flow of data between systems segmentation also allows Network and systems administrators to more easily control access to network resources therefore creating more security an example of segmentation for security would be honey Nets these are network segments that are created with the sole purpose of attracting any network attacks through the use of multiple honey pots honey pots are systems that are configured to be attractive to network attackers helping to draw attackers away from the main Network systems and into the honey net the network segment of honeypots allows the main Network to remain secure and gives Network administrators an opportunity to study and attack including the methods of Entry so that counter measures can be developed to prevent future breaches A system that should be segmented are scata systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems these are the most widespread of industrial control systems or IC the industrial control system uses coded signals over communication channels to provide control of remote equipment they're commonly used in industrial applications to Monitor and control systems utilities often use scata systems to control their operations through the use of DCs networks that is a distributed control system Network the the DCS allows for the control of multiple scata systems from a single location the stut net virus was originally designed to attack scata systems and can spread through the DCS leading to more damage from the virus segmentation of the distributed control system can limit the amount of damage caused by such a virus attack on Industrial processes now that concludes this session on the importance of network segmentation we talked about the OSI model and segmentation and then I concluded with reasons for Network segmentation now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on applying patches and updates today we're going to discuss patches and updates and then we're going to conclude by talking about upgrading versus downgrading there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we're going to begin by talking about patches and updates today's modern operating systems are very complex and are composed of tens of millions of lines of code even your network devices and appliances are very complex and have complex software packages and configurations this complexity of the modern operating system has led to the necessity for updates patches and hot fixes these are used to add features fix bugs and repair security holes as they become known One goal of Administrators is to keep systems as up toate as possible through the use of these updates patches and hot fixes reducing the system's vulnerability and increasing its functionality while reducing maintenance costs a patch is a small section of code that is used to either increase functionality or fix a problem within a software package a patch will change the version of the software package in a minor manner as in version 1.0.0 will become version 1.0.1 an update is a larg section of code that is used to either increase functionality or fix problems within a software package that become known after production an update will change the version of the software in a more major manner as in version 1.0.0 will become version 2.0.0 or using a Microsoft example Windows 8.0 became Windows 8.1 a hot fix which can also be called a vulnerability patch is similar to a patch but it is actually smaller than a patch they are designed to be deployed to fix a very specific issue within an operating system or other software package hot fixes are usually issued to fix security problems that become discovered after the software package has been produced a service pack is a cumulative Windows update pack package that contains all patches updates and hot fixes between two points of time Microsoft releases service packs as a method of easing the installation of an operating system helping to keep it current you install the operating system and then you install the service pack that way you don't have to download and install every patch update and hot fix in most cases it is possible to automate the patch and update process process through registering the product with the vendor who created it Microsoft's operating systems can be set to automatically check for updates and it will download and install them if you configure it that way most Hardware vendors offer the same type of service for firmware and drivers in most cases these Services can also be set to just inform the system of the availability of patches and updates allowing administrator to manually download and install them in a production setting all patches and updates should be installed and tested in isolation as in on a test system in a Testing Lab before they are installed on vital production equipment this reduces the chances that a patch or update will bring down a system that is functioning all right but is in need of the patch or update now let's discuss upgrading versus downgrading quite often it is highly desirable to install the latest patches and updates in order to keep systems running efficiently however sometimes issues arise with the installation of a patch or update leading to problems that were not caught during the testing phase this is where backups and downgrading come into play backup copies of all systems and configuration files should be maintained in order to downgrade or roll back to the previous version for when a problem occurs during the deployment of a patch or upgrade being able to roll back to a prior version is often easier and more efficient than trying to resolve a problem that was introduced with an update administrators should keep backup copies that include the base package of the operating system or software package a backup of the system before the patch was installed and a backup of the system after the Patch was installed all of these backups should be kept and maintained as per your organization's policy now that concludes this session on applying patches and updates we started by discussing patches and updates and then concluded with a brief discussion on upgrading versus downgrading on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on configuring switches part one today we're going to talk about unmanaged versus managed switches and then we're going to talk about spanning tree protocol there is a whole lot of information to cover not a lot of time so let's jump into this session I'm going to begin by talking about unmanaged switches and managed switches before we begin discussing the differences between unmanaged and managed switches let's talk switch Basics most switches operate at layer 2 the data link layer of the OSI reference model what makes a switch a switch is an application specific integrated circuit chip or an ASAC chip it is used to make switching decisions in place of software this allows switches to break up Collision domains this allows switches to run in full duplex mode and this allows switches to make faster decisions than either Bridges or routers when a switch receives a frame on a port it makes some simple decisions based on its media Access Control table or its Mac table it will make one of three decisions it may decide to forward the frame that is where the frame is directed out the port on which the destination Mac address resides it may decide to filter the packet that is where the frame is not directed out of ports which are not associated with the destination Mac address the final decision that it may make is to flood the frame the frame is flooded or sent out all of the ports on the switch except for the port on which it came in on an unmanaged switch is a simple switch plug it in and it works there is no method provided for configuration the unmanaged switch is designed with ease of installation as its main attribute managed switches on the other hand can be configured through either the command line or a browser based interface managed switches provide for a high degree of network customization and control a managed switch can can also be set up so that an administrator can monitor its performance remotely and use protocols such as SNMP to make some modifications to its configuration now let's move on to spanning tree protocol spanning tree protocol is a loop avoidance technology a switching Loop can occur on networks where there are multiple paths to reach destination Mac addresses digital equip Corporation created the spanning tree protocol or STP to reduce the possibility of switching Loops the switches elect a root bridge to control the switched Network the switches will shut down ports that are not the best path to the root Bridge thus reducing the risk of Loops no network traffic can flow until after the STP process has taken place and a stable state has been achieved this stable state state is called convergence and it can take a significant amount of time with STP up to 50 seconds after convergence the STP selected switch ports send out Bridge protocol data unit packets or bpdu packets to help maintain the stable State all switch ports in an STP enabled Network can be in one of five states first off there is the disabled state that is where the port is administratively shut down it's not receiving packets it's not sending packets it's just completely disabled then there's the blocking state in this state the port will not forward packets but it's still receiving bpdu packets and will drop all other frames then there's the listening state in this state the port will not forward packets but listens to bpdu packets to make sure that no Loops can occur in preparation for the next state then there's the learning state in this state the port will not forward packets but it is learning all of the paths in the network it is populating its Mac address table in preparation for the next state the last state in spanning tree protocol is the forwarding state in this state the port will forward and receive all packets that are flowing across the network that are directed to that Port the i e liked STP so much that it created the 802.1d standard this is their version of STP all modern layer 2 switches run the 802.1d standard by default the slow convergence time of the 802.1d standard led to the creation of Rapid spanning tree protocol or rstp which is also known as the i e 80 21w standard rstp has a much faster convergence time than 802.1d with rstp enabled on all switches a network can achieve its stable state in approximately 5 Seconds that's a whole lot faster than the up to 50 seconds with the 802.1d standard but rstp is not turned on by default on layer 2 switches it must be enabled by an administrator instead of five possible Port States rstp defines three possible Port States the first of these states is discarding in this state the port may be administratively disabled or it may be in a blocking mode or listening mode the next state is learning in this state the port is populating its Mac address table in preparation for forwarding packets and the final state is forwarding in this state the port is actively forwarding packets now that concludes this session on configuring switches part one I talked about unmanaged versus managed switches and then I had a brief discussion on spanning tree protocol on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on configuring switches part two today we're going to discuss installation considerations and then we're going to move on to configuring the switch Port there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into today's session of course I'm going to begin with installation considerations the first install ation consideration is whether or not you need a managed or unmanaged switch the business or Enterprise Network is more complex than the small office home office Network a Soho Network may be able to get by with using one or more unmanaged switches and still operate adequately but once beyond the level of a Soho more thought and planning is required as unmanaged switches are no longer up to the job you are going to need managed switches there are multiple issues to consider when installing a managed switch and it is wise to plan for those in advance to save both time and frustration in setting up a network one of the first things to consider is if there will be vlans virtual local area networks while switches may break up Collision domains they do not break up broadcast domains but vlans will a virtual local area Network takes a single Network environment and creates smaller Network segments by subnetting the network address range effectively breaking up the broadcast domains of that Network vlans are used in a switched Network environment for a variety of reasons to break up broadcast domains into smaller segments just like I just said another reason to use vlans is they increase security by limiting access to network resources the administ configures the vlans and then assigns users nodes or ports to a specific virtual local area network all managed switches do come with a native VLAN which is determined by the manufacturer this native VLAN is used to help manage the switch VLAN traffic is allowed to cross switch ports as long as the VLAN information matches so VLAN 2 can send traffic to VLAN 2 but VLAN 2 cannot send traffic to VLAN 3 VLAN traffic is allowed to cross switch ports as long as the VLAN information matches it does this through the use of trunk ports that means that VLAN 2 can send traffic across the trunk port to VLAN 2 but it cannot send traffic from VLAN 2 across the trunk port to VLAN 3 vtp or virtual trunk port Port protocol is a Cisco proprietary method of creating a virtual trunk Port which allows VLAN traffic to pass between switches and to automatically manage the VLAN environment in order for different vlans to communicate with each other a router or some other layer 3 device must be installed on the network the next consideration is how is the switch going to be managed switches may be managed out of band that means that no network connection is required this is achieved through the use of the console port on the switch the console Port is a specific port on managed switches used to connect to and configure or manage a switch a rollover cable may be required to make the connection to the console Port security should also be set on Console ports to prevent unauthorized access through that console port your other option for switch management may be to use inband management with inband management a network connection is used to manage the switch one of the most common methods of allowed inband management is through the use of virtual terminals or vty connections the most common vty connections are telnet or secure shell sessions SSH sessions security should also be set if telnet is allowed on vty type connections by default SSH is a secured connection if you determine that you're going to use inband management the next thing that you need to do is to establish a default gateway address that default gateway address must be placed on an interface that belongs to the native VLAN or the default virtual local area network the default gateway on a switch is different than the default gateway on on a router on a switch it is only used to manage the switch and not to pass other network traffic as part of the setup and management of the switch an administrator should configure which users and passwords are allowed to connect to the switch and what their level of access to the configuration is going to be inband and outof band management security settings may be different some users may be allowed inband management access while other others are not and vice versa if authentication authorization and accounting Protocols are used in the network the switch must be configured to use them as well with that done let's move on to configuring the switch Port I'm not going to actually show you the commands for how to configure the switch Port but I'm going to give you the information that you need to consider when configuring the switch Port first up is speed and duplexing most modern switch ports can autonegotiate both the speed of the link and the duplexing mode used but in some cases an administrator may be required to manually set both the speed and the duplex in order for a connection to occur speed and duplexing errors are the most common cause for a link not being established between a switch and a router or between switches next up is VLAN assignment all switch ports will beong to a VLAN and that VLAN will either be an administrator configured one or it will be the native virtual local area network as a side note the native VLAN can be administratively changed which should be done to increase the security level on the switch then there's trunking trunk ports are switch ports that are designed to carry VLAN traffic between switches the standard protocol used is 802.1q 802.1q strips off the VLAN tag actually it changes that tag to match the native VLAN which allows the traffic to cross over the port and then once on the other side then the 802.1 Q port on the other side reinserts the original VLAN tag and that is trunking in a nutshell you might want to consider Port bonding using lacp that's link aggregation control protocol it is is a protocol that is used to create a single logical channel from redundant connections between switches so it bonds those ports together this will increase the bandwidth between the switches now we're going to talk about po not Edgar alen po but power over ethernet some switches coming with power over ethernet ports or Poe ports these ports can use one of two methods to provide current over the network cable as well as carrying data allowing these ports to power small network devices while at the same time communicating with them the port itself May provide the current or the port may allow the use of a power injector to provide the power instead of the port itself there are multiple Poe standards in place the two most common are actually the poe standard the 802.3 AF which can provide up to 15.4 watts of current or the poe plus which is 802.3at which can provide up to 30 watts of Current Port mirroring may also be enabled on a switch Port this allows the configured port to receive all Network traffic going to and from a specific Port by using Port mirroring an administrator can examine and analyze the traffic going into and coming from from a specific host or Port Port mirroring is most often used in conjunction with a packet analyzer also known as a packet sniffer or network sniffer administrators often use port mirroring to examine the flow of traffic to determine what method of network optimization to use or for when they're determining which security measures to put in place Port mirroring can create a significant amount of network overhead so it should be used sparingly on an active Network and you may want to shut it down once your research has concluded that concludes this session on configuring switches part two I talked about installation considerations and then I talked about configuring the switch Port itself on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on wireless land infrastructure part one today I'm going to give an introduction to wireless network standards then I'm going to move on to inant technology and we will conclude with wireless access points there is a whole plethora of information to impart not a lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session I'm going to begin by giving an introduction to wireless network standards to talk about the standards I need to introduce you to the i e 802.11 specifications these are a set of specifications that deal with the data link layer and the physical layer of the OSI reference model these establish how wireless network communication can occur the 802.11 standard specifies the use of unlicensed radio frequency bands as the carrier for Network traffic it also specifies that network communication will be half duplex in nature and that it will be implemented using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance or csma CA carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance technology requires that devices only transmit data when no other data transmission signal is present on the carrier wave now the 802.11 standards have been amended over time to become our common standards that we see today these standards include the 802.11b wireless standard it was commercially released in 1997 and operates within the 2.4 gigahertz industrial scientific and medical or ISM radio frequency band now within the 2.4 GHz RF band it uses multiple channels that are 22 MHz wide there are 11 separate channels of which only three do not overlap 802.11b has a theoretical throughput of 11 megabits per second and it is compatible with the 802.11g and N standards then there's 802.11a it was also commercial commercially released in 1997 and operates within the 5 GHz unlicensed National information infrastructure or u nii radio frequency band it offers up to 23 separate channels that offer a bandwidth of 20 mahz each none of the channels overlap 802.11a has a theoretical throughput of 54 megabits per second it is not compatible with any other standard EO 211g was commercially released in 2003 and operates within the 2.4 GHz radio frequency band just like 802.11b it also offers a bandwidth of 20 mahz on 11 separate channels it has a theoretical throughput of 54 megabits per second and it's also compatible with 802.11b it's also comp compatible with 802.11n and 802.11 AC and that brings us to 802.11n it was commercially released in 2009 and can operate on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequency bands at the same time it uses a 20 MHz wide Channel within the 2.4 GHz band and a 40 mahz wide Channel with within the 5 GHz band it has a theoretical throughput of 600 megabits per second through the introduction of multiple input and multiple output mimo technology and beam forming and it is compatible with1 b1g And1 a and that brings us to 802.11ac it was commercially released in 2013 and operates on the 5 G gz radio frequency band The Available bandwidth varies by administrative settings and can be dynamically Changed by the wireless access point based on how much radio frequency interference or RFI is present and how many users are on the wireless network 802.11 AC has a theoretical throughput of over 1 gabit per second through the introduction of multiuser multiple input and multiple output technology or mu mimo technology and beam forming 802.11 AC is only compatible with 802.11g and N so why broadcast a wide signal to a specific device when it's possible to Target that device specifically this is the question that beamforming answered once a device makes a connection to an access point once a device makes a connection to an access point that is capable of beam forming the AP will autotune its antenna and transmitter to more specifically Target the device when communication occurs this can reduce RFI and increase throughput on the wireless local area network while 802.11n allowed for beam forming it was not a standardized option until the implementation of 802.11 AC since we've covered the standards let's move on to antenna technology first up the basics antennas are used to broadcast and receive radio frequency signals and they fall into two basic categories there are omnidirectional antennas which are designed to broadcast and receive signals in all directions then there are uni directional antennas which are designed to broadcast and receive signals in a specific Direction antenna placement and type of antenna will have an impact on wireless local area network performance both mimo and mimo are technologies that allow for more than one spatial stream to be transmitted and received by a single device through the use of multiple antennas mimo allows for up to four spatial channels while mimo allows for up to eight spatial channels mimo also allows for a single signal to be spread across multiple transmitters this accounts for the multiple user part of the name let's conclude with a discussion on wireless access points the wireless access point is a foundational piece of the wireless local area network the wireless access point or WAP can also be known as an access point or AP and it creates a point of entry for wireless to enter the more traditional wired networking environment the AP can also be used to join other types of networks wireless access points in most cases use unlicensed radio frequency bands in order to communicate with devices one or more antennas are used in order to radiate and receive radio frequency signals in a half duplex manner wireless routers are common in the small office home office environment they are wireless access points that have routers built good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on wireless land infrastructure part two today I'm going to be talking about basic Wireless landan topologies and then we're going to conclude with wireless landan Concepts and terms there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Wireless local area network topologies and the first topology is the ad hoc topology it's a very basic Wireless local area network that does not require the use of a wireless access point which can also be called a WAP and it can also be called an access point the devices negotiate the wireless connection between themselves an example of this are when laptops connect wirelessly without the use of a wireless access point then there's the infrastructure topology it's a more common type of Wireless local area network that uses a WAP or multiple waps to create a connection point for wireless devices most often it's used to connect a wireless network to a more traditional wired network but that wired network is not absolutely required then there's the mesh topology this is a type of infrastructure topology that employs the use of multiple access points to create larger seamless network coverage areas they're commonly deployed with wireless controllers and wireless access points something to remember is that the higher the wireless device density the more wireless access points that will be required to handle the load like any other network device access points only have a certain amount of capacity as the workload increases the amount of throughput will decrease as each device contends for access to that wireless access point adding more waps Andor adding more access points and wireless controllers can greatly ease the load and increase the efficiency of the network now let's move on to wireless land Concepts and terms first up is the ibss or independent basic service set an ibss is created when an ad hoc network topology is created the devices use the ibss in order to control the communication that occurs between the connected devices then there's the BSS or basic service set when a single wireless access point is in infrastructure mode it will create a BSS this means that it can control the flow of communication between every device that connects to the SS IDs under its control then there's the ESS or extended service set an ESS is created when two or more access points share a common SSID and have overlapping coverage through the extended service set the waps will negotiate how to hand off a wireless device between them as it roams the network so I mentioned the service set identifier just a moment ago or the SSID it plays a key role in the wireless local area network environment all active wireless access points will use a Beacon transmission to advertise the networks that they belong to what they advertise is their SSID which can also be thought of as their network name those beacons are how devices know which networks they can connect to even when an access point is set to hide the beacon the broadcasts are still occurring so although hiding the SS ID broadcast may make it more difficult to join a wireless network it's not a true security measure because the broadcast is still occurring now let's talk about 802.11 at and 802.11g DHT both of these terms relate to the 80 211n standard they denote the type of connection a high throughput connection and the radio frequency which will either be the 2.4 GHz radio frequency band or it may be a 5 GHz connection then there's goodput goodput is the actual amount of application data passed through a connection with the overhead removed it's measured in bytes per second it is different than through throughput measures the total amount of data capable of being passed through a connection so it includes Network overhead then we have signal strength it's a measure of the strength of the radio frequency signal that comes from an access point which can help to determine the amount of area that can be covered by that access point as a general rule the closer a device is to the wireless access point the stronger the signal that is received this strength of signal can be affected by wireless access point or antenna placement the type of antenna used and interference sources that may be present a wireless sight survey with heat mapping tools can help in the setup of a high quality Wireless local area network or it can help you to pinpoint problem areas within your network the heat mapping software builds a visual map by measuring the received signal strength indicator or RSSI and the signal to noise Ratio or SNR which can be directly correlated to data throughput using these tools allows the administrator to find gaps and coverage as well as areas where the coverage extends beyond the desired boundaries helping to create a more efficient and secure network now that concludes this session on wireless land infrastructure structure part two I talked about basic wireless land topologies and we concluded with some wireless land Concepts and terms on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on risk RK and security related Concepts today I'm going to be talking about the big picture of recovery and then we're going to move on to some Concepts and terms that you should know there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into this session we begin with the big picture of recovery standards and policies are used to help ensure that everyone is on the same page at the same time all organizations should review their operations and create standards and policies that suit their needs once they are created the standards and policies should be adhered to this includes all of the information technology systems by stressing the importance of standards and policies risks to an organization can be reduced and security can be strengthened all policies and standards should be reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they remain relevant and be updated as necessary one of the standards or policies that should be created is the disaster recovery plan a disaster is any event or emergency that goes beyond the normal response resources as in an earthquake or a flood or a major fire the longer a business is not able to function the more damage is done the damage recovery plan or DRP detail the steps to recover from a disaster situation as in when the offsite backups need to be used or if a fall back site needs to be brought into operation they also have sections dealing with how to help ensure employee safety a subelement of the DRP is the business continuity plan or BCP a BCP includes an impact analysis of the business effects of down systems the impact analysis helps to identify single points of failure in the business system a BCP helps to prioritize what systems or processes need to be brought back first to get an organization operational again it identifies Mission critical systems processes and data the business continuity plan helps to guide the creation of the disaster recovery plan now let's talk about some concept ceps in terms that you should know first up is single point of failure a single point of failure is a system or component that if it goes down has a major impact on operations an example of a single point of failure is if a key router goes down and it prevents customers from ordering products that's a single point of failure once identified these failure points can be mitigated through several different methods such as redundant systems as in adding a backup router to the previous example or maybe a redundant power supply single points of failure can also be mitigated through system redesign as in removing that point of failure through a redesign of the system you should also be familiar with uninterruptable power supplies or the UPS a UPS will mitigate power issues that can have a negative impact on sensitive networking components it conditions the incoming power to remove spikes and sags in the current helping to ensure that the flow of current is even and consistent which is very beneficial to your electronic and networking components they also help to ensure the continued operation at least for a given period of time in the case of complete electrical power supply loss as in an outage depending upon your UPS you may be able to run for minutes hours or possibly days if you have a generator First Responders are the first people to discover or respond to a security issue ideally it will be someone who has been properly trained in how to deal with the situation within the network security realm First Responders can play a key role in mitigating damage and collecting evidence then there's the concept of a data breach which is any unon authorize access to data particularly to sensitive data breaches may be unintentional or intentional they may also occur from inside the network so internally or they may originate from an external source so they may come from outside of your network the severity of the breach is greatly determined by the sensitivity and the quantity of the data that's been accessed data breaches can be very expensive to organizations they can result in a loss of reputation which can lead to a loss of Revenue when it became known that Target lost sensitive customer information you know credit card information people became unwilling or uncomfortable with shopping at Target even though they quickly fixed the breach the results lingered on a data breach may result in a loss of business Secrets which may cost that organization a competitive advantage and finally data breach may result in fines or penalties levied by governments or other organizations user awareness and training can greatly reduce your security risks quite often the weakest link in the security chain is the end user the risks can be reduced by making the users properly aware of security and security threats through awareness training and just security training in general this training should be conducted on an ongoing basis it's never a oneandone thing penetration testing is the finding of weak spots and the hardening of systems it is actively and aggressively testing the whole it system in an effort to find weak spots this can include using social engineering methods on your end users to find out if they are your weak link the data generated is used to harden the it system in an effort to mitigate future risks similar to penetration testing is vulnerability scanning this is the finding of network holes and then plugging them it's mostly done through the use of automated software networks are probed for vulnerabilities as in open ports or unnecessary protocols once these ports or protocols have been identified these holes into the network can then be plugged but remember you need to have authorization to perform vulnerability scanning or you may be having an uncomfortable discussion with your security Personnel now that concludes this session on risk and security related Concepts I talked about the big picture of recovery and then I covered some Concepts and terms that you should know on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common Network vulnerabilities today we're going to be discussing vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocols and we're going to conclude with vulnerable Network practices there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's jump into this session I will Begin by discussing vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocols network security is never a completely done deal it often seems as if as soon as one hole is plugged another one opens up vulnerabilities are discovered all the time making it difficult for Network administrators to keep up while this is true there are still some steps that administrators should take to reduce the vulnerabilities that exist in the systems under their control by reducing known vulnerabilities administrators can then spend their time preparing for in reducing exposure to upand cominging threats thus increasing their productivity the first vulnerable protocol that we're going to discuss is telnet telnet is a protocol that is used to create a virtual terminal connection that is commonly used for troubleshooting tnet is very insecure because all communication occurs in clear text tnut does not support encryption whenever possible secure shell or SSH should be used to create those virtual terminal Connections in place of tnet then there is SNMP simple Network management protocol versions one and two SNMP is a protocol that is used to remotely manage and configure network devices due to their lack of encryption support versions one and two are unsecure and susceptible to packet sniffers this can allow an attacker to grab those packets and actually gain control of the configuration and management of your network devices if you're going to use SNMP version 3 should always be used as it supports more security including encryption FTP or file transfer protocol is a prot call that is used to transfer files across a network connection while a username and password are required in most cases to use FTP it doesn't support encryption which creates a vulnerability in the process because of this lack of encryption support everything is done in the clear making it susceptible to being captured and you could lose sensitive information secure FTP or SFTP should be used to in place of FTP as it creates an SSH FTP session tftp or trivial file transfer protocol is a simple stripped down version of FTP that doesn't support authentication like standard FTP so it's even more unsecure it is commonly used to download and upload configuration files for networking equipment tftp should only be used when a connection to networking equipment is made through the console Port thus eliminating the possibility of EAS dropping and that console Port should have its own security measures in place everyone's fairly familiar with HTTP or hypertex transfer protocol it's the protocol that is used to send and receive data over the Internet it is unsecure in its basic format and susceptible to being intercepted due to a lack of encryption https or HTTP secure should be used when conducting sensitive business over the internet as it will provide encryption and other Security Services hopefully your network still doesn't use serial line IP or slip it is an early protocol that was developed for communicating over serial ports and modem connections that required a static IP address it is very outdated and very unsecure slip does not support encryption hopefully you will be using pointto Point protocol in its place PPP does support encryption and is much more secure now it's time to talk about vulnerable Network practices first up are unpatched or Legacy systems unpatch systems are by their very nature unsecure keeping all operating systems in applications up to date will reduce vulnerabilities in the network and it helps to harden that Network against attack in some situations it is necessary to keep Legacy systems alive this can create vulnerabilities in the system as weaknesses in these Legacy systems tend to be well known special security measures should be taken with Legacy systems in order to reduce the opportunity for exploitation one of the best security steps that you can take is placing these Legacy applications or systems on their own network or on their own virtual local area networks then there are open ports and an open port can either be physical or it can be an application Port these open ports create a hole in the security of the network and may be exploited while not all open ports can or should be closed security should be placed on these ports that need to remain open to reduce the vulnerability of the network a good practice is to use a port scanner periodically to verify that only absolutely required application ports are open another thing to remember is that you should only use a port scanner if you are authorized to scan that Network or you may end up in a rather lengthy discussion with your security Personnel unnecessary running services are another vulnerable Network practice operating system services are used to perform some functions within the system but it is possible for them to be exploited a periodic review of all running Services should be conducted on all equipment that is attached to the network all unnecessary running Services should be disabled to harden your network clear text credal credentials are another vulnerability that's rather common many applications and devices require the use of credentials in order to be used in some cases these credentials are sent in clear text format which makes them easier to read when captured a good practice is to periodically review all applications and systems to determine which ones use Clear text credentials then you need to either limit their use or figure out how to encrypt the Transmissions to secure your systems unencrypted communication channels are another problem any method of communication on the network that is not encrypted is an unencrypted channel that is subject to being breached while not all communication channels need to be encrypted a good practice is to review all channels and make a decision about which ones need to be encrypted and which ones do not all wireless network channels should be encrypted there are no exceptions do not create an unencrypted wireless network that's just asking for problems a vulnerability that few Network administrators think about our RF or radio frequency emanations one method of intercepting communication is to analyze signal leakage that's the RF emanation many forms of communication are subject to these signal emanations but there are steps that can be taken to reduce them Tempest is a set of Standards established by the NSA and NATO that outline steps that can be used to reduce the opportunity for the interception and Analysis of communication that concludes this session on common Network vulnerabilities I began with vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocol calls I then concluded with vulnerable Network practices on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common Network threats part one today we're going to be discussing Inside Job or threats and we're going to conclude with some outside threats to your network with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about inside jobs or threats first up is malicious employees we may not know the reason why they're malicious but they are difficult to defend against as they are already inside the defenses of the network and because their employees resources have been granted to them in order for them to be able to do their job one of the best defenses against malicious employees is using the principle of least privilege only granting the least amount of authorization that is required for a person to get their work done that's the best defense against a malicious employee compromised systems are another threat once a PC or network device has been compromised it is vitally important to isolate it from the system as a whole a compromised PC could lead to a completely compromised Network as malware may be able to spread across its connections once malware has gained access to network resources it can be extremely difficult to root out and remove malware may also degrade the Network's performance causing other issues then there is social engineering this is the process of using social pressure to cause somebody to compromise a system from inside the defenses of the network social engineering pressure can be applied in multiple forms an employee can receive a phone call from somebody claiming to be from the IT department asking for their credentials it may occur in person the social engineering can occur through email or through a rogue website there are many Avenues in which social engineering can occur the best defense is through enduser education training your end users to resist social engineering is a good idea ARP cach poisoning is another threat that can occur on your network in ARP cach poisoning the ARP cach which maps IP addresses to Mac addresses is corrupted by an attacker with the end result being that the attack hacker has control of which IP addresses are associated with Mac addresses it's commonly used in man in the Middle attacks which I will cover in just a bit then there are protocol or packet abuse threats this is the process of taking a specific protocol and repurposing it to perform a different function protocol abuse is commonly used to bypass a router's Access Control list from inside of a network an example of this is encapsulating a not allowed protocol within a DNS packet which is almost always an allowed protocol in order to get that unallowed protocol out of the network the man in the middle attack is another threat that you should be aware of the attacker is not necessarily inside the network per se but is in between two endpoints that are Comm communicating on a network in most cases the manin themiddle attack involves disrupting the ARP process between the two endpoints the attack allows a malicious user to be able to view all Network packets that are flowing between the communicating hosts often a man in themiddle attack is used in an attempt to gain sensitive information like Network credentials then there's VLAN hopping this is circumventing the security that is inherent when virtual local area networks are created normally traffic that is tagged for one VLAN is not allowed onto another VLAN without the intervention of a router VLAN hopping occurs when the attacker adds an additional fake VLAN tag to the network packets once the packets get to the switch the switch strips one of the VLAN tags off the packet and then passes it through once through the switch packet is considered as belonging to the new VLAN thus bypassing the security that's inherent in vlans now let's move to outside threats one of the largest threats that face network security Personnel is the unknown vulnerability Network and systems administrators expend vast amounts of time protecting the assets under their control and they can do a pretty good job of hardening their systems but it's not a perfect job the problem lies with zero day attacks zero day attacks take advantage of either new or recently discovered vulnerabilities which means that the networks and systems probably haven't been hardened against them yet the unfortunate reality is that attacks keep changing and Security Experts must be willing to adapt in order to keep Pace if they can't adapt they will fall behind and their networks become become vulnerable let's talk about the Brute Force attack this is using computing power in time to compromise passwords the attacker uses a program that continually tries different password combinations often in the form of a special dictionary application in an effort to crack a password the best defense against this is to limit the number of times that a user can attempt to log on before they're locked down out then they're spoofing this is a category of threats where either the MAC address or the IP address of the attacker has been modified to look like a friendly address in order to bypass network security a common use in the past was for an attacker to spoof their IP address so that the outside attacker was actually viewed as an inside host a common defense against this type of spoofing is an ACL rule that does doesn't allow an inside IP address to come from outside of your network then there's session hijacking an attacker attempts to take over a communication session after a user has been authenticated the hijacking can occur through various methods as in using a packet sniffer to steal a session cookie or installing malware on a user's computer that is activated after the user is authenticated that concludes this session on common Network threats part one I talked about inside jobs or threats and then I concluded with a brief discussion on some outside threats now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on common Network threats part two today I'm going to be talking about more outside threats and then I'm going to be talking about some wireless network threats I have a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about outside threats because of how they are implemented it is often difficult to put network security threats into a single category many attempts to breach a network combine different aspects of different threats for example a man in the Middle attack is often combined with some type of spoofing that is used to help it succeed that means that in most cases security requires more than just a single line of defense good administrators recognize this and Implement multiple layers of security in order to harden and protect their systems the first major threat that we're going to talk about is the denial of service threat or the Dos threat this covers a very broad category of threats to networks and systems that's because dos covers any threat that can potentially keep users or customers from using network resources as designed a traditional dos attack attempts to flood a network with enough traffic to bring it down it's commonly used with a flood of M well formed icmp requests the host that receives the flood can be so busy dealing with the delus of data that it cannot respond to legitimate requests then there's the permanent dos attack it's an attempt to permanently deny a network resource for others it can be achieved by physically destroying or removing the resource or it can also be achieved through the use of malware that corrupts or damages the underlying digital system to the point where it cannot be repaired and must be replaced there are also friendly or unintentional denial of service attacks an unintended dos attack can occur when poorly written applications consume more network resources than are available another unintentional dos attack can occur when a network interface controller or Nick begins to fail it's quite common when a Nick is about to fail for it to go offline and come back online repeatedly and rapidly this consumes network resources which can cause an unintentional dos more destructive than the standard denial of service attack is the distributed denial of service attack or the DDOS attack it's a denial of service attack in which more than a single system is involved in sending the attack a DDOS attack has a higher chance of succeeding due to the increased number of participants the machines used to send the attack may be voluntary participants this is called a coordinated attack or they may be part of a botn net with the botn net malware has been installed on the machines and they are no longer under the complete control of their owners many distributed denial of service attacks involve bot Nets where the attacker has actually rented the bot net for the sole purpose of Performing the DDOS the goal of the DDOS is to create a large enough enough spike in traffic that the target becomes unreachable in some cases the target system may need to be rebooted in order for it to come back online there's the reflective denial of service attack it's also known as an amplified dos the attacker uses some method usually some form of spoofing to hide the source of the attack in a reflective DNS attack the attacker usually spoofs the intended Target's IP address and sends multiple requests to an open DNS server the DNS server responds by sending traffic back to the targeted system and the attacker's hope is that the response from the DNS server will overwhelm the targeted system a cousin to the reflective DNS attack is the reflective ntp attack or the reflective Network time protocol attack it works in the same way however instead of using DNS it relies upon open ntp servers not very common anymore but you still need to know about it are the Smurf attacks also known as smurfing it's a type of reflective denial of service attack that also involves spoofing the intended Target's IP address another network is flooded with icmp requests in which the source address for the requests appear to be that of the intended target as the replies returned the network becomes slowed down by the traffic the goal is to overwhelm the target system and bring it down it's time to move on to wireless network threats our first topic is an unintended threat a common feature on Modern wireless access points is WiFi protected setup or WPS the goal of WPS is to create an easy and secure method for consumers and small businesses to set up a secure wireless network unfortunately the outcome has fallen short of the goal while WPS does ease the setup burden it is also easily exploited by an attacker and should actually be disabled on all equipment this exploit has been known for a couple of years years and you would think that equipment manufacturers would quit enabling WPS by default on their equipment but that's not the case so when you set it up you good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on network hardening techniques part one today I'm going to discuss using secure protocols using antimalware software and I'm going to conclude with implementing switch and router security there's a whole lot of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about using secure protocols network security is always an ongoing process because the threats to it keep changing although security threats are continually evolving administrators can use some techniques to harden the base Network structure to help ease the ever shifting security landscape these hardening techniques establish a good security Foundation that can be further built upon making the network that much harder to crack one of these hardening techniques is to use secure protocols whenever possible so let's discuss some of those protocols first up is secure shell or SSH it's a protocol that is used to create an encrypted Communications session between devices it's commonly used to create a secure virtual terminal session it should be used in place of telnet whenever possible then there's SNMP version 3 that's simple Network management protocol version 3 it's a protocol that's used to manage and configure devices remotely on the network it's more secure than the prior two versions because it supports encryption secure file transfer protocol or SFTP should always be used in place of FTP it's a protocol that's used to transfer data and manage file structures in a secure manner through the use of an SS session as I said just a moment ago it is a better option than FTP which requires user authentication but does not encrypt the communication SFTP en CPS the whole process then there's TLS or transport layer security it's a cryptographic protocol that's used to encrypt online Communications it uses certificates and asymmetrical cryptography to authenticate hosts and exchange security Keys it is a better option than SSL or secure socket layer which functions in a similar manner when performing sensitive online online business you should use https hyper text transfer protocol secure it's a protocol that is used to secure the communications Channel between a web browser and a web server https uses either TLS or SSL technology IPC or IPC is a network layer IP security protocol Suite that can use multiple methods to mutually authenticate both ends of the communication Channel it also will encrypt all data Transmissions unlike most other protocols it can provide endtoend security for any application let's move to using anti maware software antimalware applications help to protect networks and network resources against malware intrusions as in spyware viruses and worms there are are three main options for using antimalware applications there's hostbased antimalware the application is installed on the individual machines and only protects those nodes on which it resides it's easily tuned to the needs of the individual host but requires that the user keep it up to dat then there's networkbased antimalware the application is installed within the local network and served to the individual client that require it it is easily administered but harder to tune for the individual hosts but the network administrator can ensure that it remains up to dat finally there's cloudbased antimalware the application resides in the cloud so it is outside of the local network and it is served to the clients inside the local network as needed this service has a very small footprint on the local machine and tends to be be kept more current than the other options but it is an added cost that must be evaluated let's conclude with talking about implementing switch in router security when is using a password not secure well the answer is when the password is kept in clear text one solution to this is to save passwords and other sensitive information as hashes hashing is a cryptographic process that uses an algorithm to derive a set value also known as the hashed value from the sensitive data the hash can be used to verify that data is coming from where it is supposed to and that it has not been intercepted or changed in transit the most popular hashing algorithms are md5 and Sh or Shaw of the two Shaw is the more secure and the wise network administrator makes sure that all password and usernames are kept as hashed values under implementing switch security measures switch Port security measures are vital first off switch Port security should be enabled all Enterprise switches are capable of having security measures enabled at the Port level and that should happen also the native VLAN should be changed from its default value all active ports should be assigned Ed to nonnative vlans all nonactive switch ports should be assigned to an unused nonnative VLAN also vlans should be created to clearly segment the network into logical secure areas a switchport security measure that should be considered is MAC address filtering this will only allow specific Mac addresses to connect to specific ports DHCP snooping should be enabled this will only allow DHCP responses from an administrator defined switch Port this means that all DHCP responses will come from the same port in addition to DHCP snooping Dynamic ARP inspection or Dai should also be enabled this process is combined with DHCP snooping to restrict the opportunity for ARP cache poisoning to occur all address resolution protocol requests are compared against the ARP table contained in the administratively defined DHCP server implementing these measures will greatly increase the security of your switches let's move on to router security measures each interface on a router should have an access control list or ACL in place to control and filter traffic each interface can actually have two ACLS one ACL on the inbound side of the interface and one ACL on the outbound side of the interface an ACL is a set of rules that is used to govern and filter the flow of network traffic into and out of a network the ACL examines packets against its established rules beginning from the first rule at the top of the list and continuing down through all the rules the rules either allow or deny the packet from continuing once the packet matches a rule the rule is enforced and the ACL process is exited ACL rules can be based on protocols and ports IP addresses Source addresses destination addresses Etc all ACLS end with an implicit deny statement meaning that if it isn't specifically allowed then the packet is discarded the ACL can be time based as in day of the week or time of day and it can fulfill a specific function based on the reason that it is created as in an ACL can be used to filter out websites or web content that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part one I talked about using secure protocol then we moved on to using antimalware software and we concluded with a brief discussion on implementing switch and router Security on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network hardening techniques part two today we're going to talk about encryption Basics and then we're going to talk about wireless network hardening and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on security policies with that let's go ahead and begin this session I'm going to begin by talking about encryption Basics encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling the data so that it can't be read if it gets intercepted encryption relies upon the fact that the receiver of The Scrambled data has the proper key that allows it to unscramble the data and put the message back together the strength of the encryption is usually determined by the strength of the key the strength of the key is measured in the number of bits that it takes to generate the key the more bits that it takes the stronger the key the private key in this Arrangement the private key cannot decrypt what it encrypted and the public key cannot decrypt what it encrypted so it only works if there are two separate keys so let's talk about those asymmetrical encryption keys there are two main types tyes of asymmetrical encryption keys there is the EAP TLS type key that's extensible authenication protocol transport layer security type of key it requires the use of a certificate Authority or CA that is trusted by both parties the ca provides the certificates to both parties that allow for the generation of both the public and private security Keys it's very secure but it is also difficult to manage and maintain then there's ttls tunneling transport layer security it's as secure as the EAP TLs but only the authentication server receives a certificate for the key generation process and it's easier to manage and maintain than EAP TLS with that covered let's move on to wireless network hardening wireless networks can represent a special challenge in the network hardening process the goal of most hardening techniques is to keep nefarious elements from ever seeeing the network traffic but with wireless networks that is all but imposs as traffic is broadcast over known radio frequency channels this traffic is subject to capture and the Transmissions inform any who care that an active wireless network is present there are steps that can be taken as in encrypting the traffic to make sure that even if the network traffic is captured it cannot be read this helps to keep the network traffic safe and the network from being breached one of the first techniques that you can use to harden a wireless network is MAC address filtering MAC address filtering can be used to limit which devices can connect to the wireless network if an unknown Mac address attempts to connect to the network it is ignored by the wireless access point so when it requests to join the WAP checks its Mac filter and if that Mac isn't in the filter it just drops that requester while Mac filtering can be effective it can also be difficult to manage and it is also possible to spoof Mac addresses which brings us to basic authentication and encryption for wireless networ works first up is web or wired equivalent privacy it's an encryption standard that uses either a 40 bit or 128bit encryption key in the rc4 algorithm to authenticate devices and encrypt Transmissions it uses a preshared key as a password or passphrase to authenticate users web is easily cracked and should not be used as a matter of fact web can be cracked in minutes better than weap is WPA WiFi protected access it's an authentication and encryption standard that improved upon web but still uses psk and the rc4 algorithm but to increase security it also introduced temporal key Integrity protocol or tkip tkip generates a new security key for every packet and that new security key has a strength of 128 bits or greater now it's not as easily cracked as web but it can still be cracked and should not be used unless absolutely necessary and hopefully that's not the case in your wiress network better than WPA is WPA2 personal WiFi protected access to personal it's an authentication and encryption standard that improved upon WPA it does not rely upon the weak rc4 encryption algorithm but it does use AES as its algorithm that's Advanced encryption standard it can also use the psk method but this is not required as WPA2 personal can also dynamically assign security keys while it's theoretically possible to crack WPA2 personal it would be extreme extremely difficult to do so so this should be the minimum level of security on any wireless network better yet if possible deploy WPA2 Enterprise now this forms a portion of the 802.1x standard it is used to authenticate users on a wireless network and uses one of the forms of the extensible Authentication Protocol in setting up the encryption a central authentication server is required for 802.1x or WPA2 Enterprise which does allow for greater control over the authentication process as a side note EAP is actually a set of definitions for how security keys will be exchanged in order for encryption to take place it's time to conclude with a brief discussion on security policies while security policies are only written documents they can actually do quite a bit to harden a network against a breach security policies document or outline what is allowed or not allowed to occur on the network from a security point of view they're usually crafted at the upper layer of management with the help of knowledgeable IT personnel they establish the expected Behavior which can go a long ways towards hardening your network security policies give administrators the authority to put into place measures to protect the security of the network in many cases they also give administrators the authority to enforce the policies that lead to a hardened Network well that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part two I began by talking about encryption Basics then we moved on to wireless network hardening and we concluded with a brief discussion on security policies on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network hardening techniques part three today I'm going to discuss user authentication and then I'm going to talk about some authentication and authorization methods there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session of course I'm going to start by talking about user authentication hardening the network will not do you any good if there is poor authentication of the users and devices that are allowed on the network the process of proving that you are who you say you are if you are a person or that you are what you say you are if it's a device is called authentic ation authentication is different than authorization authorization is what you are allowed to do after you have been authenticated there are several different ways in which users can be authenticated and there are several different methods in which authentication can be implemented let's talk about basic authentication of the user there are three basic factors for authenticating users there's by by what you know this is the user and password method by what you are this is commonly implemented through biometric and finally there is by what you have this is commonly implemented through the use of security tokens these are the three basic factors for authenticating users now you can combine these in a process that's called multiactor authentication that's requiring the use of more than one of the factors of authentication as in requiring a password and a fingerprint scan or the code from a security token and a password those are multiactor authentication now multiactor authentication is used to increase the security of the authentication process you might also Implement a single sign on process it's a process in which the user only has to provide authentication once via a single smart device rather than having to authenticate for each and every Network resource that they request so let's talk about authentication and authorization methods the first method we're going to talk about is Pap password Authentication Protocol when logging into a network resource the user or device is required to supply a username and password the username and password are sent in clear text format so this method is considered unsecure and should only be used as a last resort more secure than Pap is Chap challenge handshake Authentication Protocol it is similar to Pap in that when logging into a network resource the user or device is challenged to supply a username and secret password and it authenticates through a threeway handshake process the way it works the resource issues a challenge it wants to know the hashed value of the username and secret password the user's device sends the hashed value to the resource device the resource evaluates the hashed value and either accepts or rejects The Connection by using chap the username and password are never sent in clear text it's much more secure than pap there's also Ms chap it's functionally the same as challenge handshake Authentication Protocol but it is Microsoft's proprietary implementation of it you might also Implement one of the forms of extensible Authentication Protocol or EAP it's not a single protocol on its own but a set of additional authentication methods used by remote access clients currently there are are more than 100 different methods defined by the EAP specifications one of the more popular is Kerberos so let's talk about Kerberos it's an Authentication Protocol which uses TCP or UDP Port 88 by default it's a system of authentication and authorization that works well in environments that have a lot of clients the main component of Kerberos is the key Distribution Center or the KDC the KDC has two parts the authentication server or as and the ticket granting service or TGs here's how it works when a user logs in a hashed value of his or her username and password is sent to the authentication server if the as likes the hash it responds with a ticket granting ticket and a timestamp so it will respond with a TGT that also has a timestamp the client then sends the TGT with the timestamp to the ticket granting service the TGs the TGs then responds with a service ticket which can also be called an access token or just a token the service ticket authorizes the user to access specific resources on that Network as long as the TGT is still valid the TGs will grant additional authorization by issuing a new service ticket as required for as long as the TGT and its Tim stamp are still valid now that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part three I talked about user authentication and then we concluded by talking about authentication and authorization methods on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I trust I'll new another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on physical network security control today we're going to be discussing the why of physical network security and then we're going to move on to some physical network security practices there's a fair amount of information to in part so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing the why of physical network security your network security actually begins at the door the boundaries of your building should be your first line of defense if an attacker has physical access to the network resources then there is a high probability that those network resources can be breached the level of security that that gets deployed should be driven by the amount of security that is needed as the need for overall security increases so should the level of physical security there are dangers that are associated with unauthorized physical access there is theft of those network resources and they are expensive to replace unintentional damage can occur when there is unauthorized physical access it only takes a simple spilled drink to destroy a server or a router or a switch or some other expensive component it's also possible that if an attacker has physical access they can reconfigure those network resources this can result in a breached Network one type of reconfiguration that's possible are devices that have credential workarounds some networking equipment comes with known workaround rounds for when administrator credentials need to be recovered as in when an administrator leaves an organization without disclosing his or her log on credentials or when an administrator forgets those credentials Cisco even publishes the steps of its workaround on its website and those steps are available for anybody to review if you're curious about those steps you can check out that web link that I've posted here this wellknown vulnerability is an easy exploit for anybody that has physical access to Cisco equipment with the why of physical network security out of the way let's move on to physical network security practices basic physical security should include knowing who's in the building and who has access to equipment you can do that through employee badges security checkin should be implemented for all visitors all vulnerable network resources as in servers and networking equipment should be kept in a secure area then there's intermediate physical security this is where access to all vulnerable network resources is controlled and logged one way to implement this is to use RFID badges to gain access to network resources or you could Implement Cipher locks that people have to punch a code in order to unlock the door another step in intermediate physical security is the separation of resources switches and routers are secured separately from servers with different access levels for the servers and the networking equipment in environments where high security is needed advanced physical security needs to be implemented a zoned approach is an advanced physical security practice it's a layering of Security in which multiple barriers or security tests must be passed before physical access is granted the methods of physical security that are used can be thought of as those security tests you can use security guards requiring all authorized Personnel to have some form of ID so that the security guards can identify if that person is in an area in which they're allowed then there are door locks you could use Simple key locks the analog approach a slightly more advanced method would be Cipher locks with the deployment of different codes for different areas or different groups of people this allows for the logging of who has unlocked a door you might also Implement RFID magnetic locks which also allow for the logging of of who has unlocked the lock one of the most advanced types of door locks would be be a biometric lock they're locks that make the person gaining access prove who they are through either a fingerprint scan or a retinal scan or possibly even a voice print video monitoring can also be deployed as a form of physical security allowing you to record who has had access to those resources you need to remember to store the recordings separately from the resources being monitored so if the resource gets stolen they don't steal the recording as well you may Implement a separation of resources networking equipment is kept separate from servers and the methods of access for the two resources are different and finally in highly secure environments a man trap may be implemented a man trap usually involves at least two doors access is granted through one door but the next door cannot be opened until further verification a has been achieved and the person that's between the doors cannot go back out the other door that means that ideally the person between the doors is trapped until some action or verification takes place that concludes this session on physical network security control we talked about the why of physical network security and then we concluded with a brief discussion on physical network security practices on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian Ferrell and welcome to pait's session on firewall Basics today I'm going to discuss types of firewalls and then we're going to move on to firewall settings and techniques I have a whole whole plethora of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into today's session of course I'm going to start with types of firewalls first up are hostbased firewalls these are installed at the node which is usually a desktop computer they're often used in conjunction with network based firewalls now hostbased firewalls are always software applic ations then there are networkbased firewalls usually these are implemented on the perimeter of the network segment that needs the protection they're used to protect private networks from public or outside networks networkbased firewalls can be a network appliance which means that it was specially designed and deployed to provide only firewall services or it can be a software application either as part of the router's operating system or as a specialty application on a server that is providing some routing function it's time to move on to small office home office firewalls in most cases the network firewall is provided by a wide area network connection device so most often the main firewall is provided by the DSL modem or the cable modem in conjunction with this a hostbased firewall is often used with the networkbased firewall this provides a little bit more protection and it allows for more granular configuration of the firewall protection part of network security there are stateless inspection firewalls these examine all the packets either entering or leaving the network it examines these packets against a set of rules the set of rules is called an access control list or ACL the AC CL rules are defined as static values by an administrator as I stated all of the packets are examined against the rules in the ACL starting with the first rule if a packet matches a rule that rule is enforced and then the ACL is exited stateless inspection firewalls do not care about the state of the connection they only care about the packets and all packets are examined then there are State f inspection firewalls a stateful inspection firewall doesn't really care about the packets it only cares about the state of a connection between two endpoints as a general rule connections are not allowed to be made from outside of the local network segment to the local network segment being protected only the initial packets going from inside the network to a destination outside of the network are inspected against an ACL if the ACL allow allows those packets to leave the network and a connection is made or once the connection has been established the firewall only monitors the state of that connection it allows the free flow of packets between the inside note and the outside destination as long as the state of the connection remains valid there are application aware firewalls these are firewalls that not only examine the packets but also the app apption protocol that is being used so it knows if it's FTP or HTTP that's being used application aware firewalls make allow or deny decisions based on the application later protocol as well as other ACL rules they are slower but more thorough in protecting the private Network than firewalls that are not application aware there are also context aware firewalls these are firewalls that can identify not only applications but also users Andor devices this is the context of the traffic so context aware firewalls can be used to restrict or allow traffic based on the context as well as other ACL rules then there are unified threat management devices or UTM devices these are network appliances that include not only a firewall service but other services as as well usually intrusion detection services or intrusion Prevention Services one concern with a UTM device is that it can create a single point of failure in the network what happens to the network if that UTM device fails is your security gone or does the network go down that is a concern about using a UTM most often firewalls are implemented on a router's interface or at the host level when implemented on the router interface the firewall takes part in the routing process when implemented at the host level the firewall protects the host on which it resides there is an exception to these scenarios and it's the implementation of a virtual wire firewall this type of firewall is a networkbased firewall that resides between two devices and provides neither routing nor switching functions if it contains two interfaces and as traffic passes between those interfaces the packets are compared to an ACL but it's usually not used to protect a specific host and it does not take part in the routing function it's time to proceed with firewall settings and techniques first up is the ACL each firewall interface may have two ACLS associated with it an inbound ACL and an out outbound ACL the inbound ACL examines all packets inbound on that interface an outbound ACL examines all packets outbound on that interface the ACL contains a set of administrator defined rules that either allow or deny packet traffic rules can be based on such criteria as Source or destination IP address Mac address protocol and time of day when an ACL examined packets those packets are examined against the set of rules from top to bottom once a rule is matched as in deny FTP packets from leaving the network that rule is enforced and the ACL is exited the last rule of any ACL is an implicit deny that means if the packet being evaluated does not match any of the explicit rules of the ACL the implicit deny is enacted and the packet is blocked care and caution should be used whenever creating an ACL if nothing else because that implicit deny statement ends every ACL list you may end up blocking traffic that you did not intend to block it's time to discuss firewall placement and we're going to begin with perimeter placement this requires that the firewall be placed at the outside edge Edge usually at the wide area network connection of the local segment or the land segment stateful inspection firewalls work well on the perimeter they are usually slower to make the initial connection but once that connection is achieved they offer better performance you could have internal placement of your firewall this requires that the firewall be placed in a logical central location it's usually used to route between different internal private networks stateless inspection firewalls work well for internal placement they are faster to make connections and require less memory a DMZ or demilitarize Zone requires a special configuration or placement considerations for your firewalls the DMZ is a specific area that is created usually between two firewalls that allows outside access to network resources while the internal network is still protected from outside traffic you should consider using a DMZ if you're going to have a web server on your network outside users will need to access your web server which is on your network but your internal network still needs to be protected from malicious traffic the external facing router allows specific outside traffic into the DMZ while the internal router prevents that same outside traffic from entering the internal Network that concludes this session on firewall Basics I talked about types of firewalls and then we ended with firewall settings and techniques on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on network access control today we're going to be talking about Edge versus access control and then we're going to talk about some Access Control concepts with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Edge versus Access Control when access to network resources is granted or denied by a firewall it is considered to be at the edge of the network so that is edge control while this may work well in smaller and simpler networks it can become very complicated and cumbersome as the network grows through implementing other Access Control measures these complications can be reduced while at the same time the security of the network may be increased this idea is called network access control control or Knack these Access Control measures do not replace the need for firewalls they do however allow the firewalls to concentrate on controlling Network traffic into and out of the network that is what they do best and that is what they should be concerned about not who or what type of device can connect to the network firewalls are not very efficient at that aspect of edge Access Control let's move on to some Access Control Concepts first up is authentication via 802.1x 802.1x is a popular method of authenticating client devices and users on either Ethernet or wireless networks when a client device which is called the supplicant attempts to join a network an authenticator which is usually a switch or wireless access point requests the supplicant credentials the authenticator then forwards the client's credentials to an authentication server or as which is typically running software such as remote authentication dial in user service or radius the authentication server evaluates the credentials and either informs the authenticator to allow or deny the supplicant device access to the protected network if the credentials are validated the authenticator that remember that's that switch or wireless access point grants the supplicant access to the protected network 802.1x is very popular in Enterprise type networks Access Control can also be achieved through posture assessment this is the process of evaluating more than just the client's credentials commonly posture assessment is used to evaluate the type of device that is requesting a connection is it a tablet or is it a PC or is it a mobile phone so on and so forth posture assessment can be used to evaluate the type of antimalware software that's on the device and how updated that software is during this process a check is also performed to determine if malware is present on the device posture assessment is commonly used to evaluate the operating system as well as in how updated that operating system is and what the registry settings are at the time that access is being requested if the client passes the assessment it is allowed onto the protected network if the client does not pass the assessment usually one of two actions are taken the first action could be that the client is notified of the rejection and what has to occur before it can pass the posture assessment does it need an operating system update does it need antimalware installed so on and so forth the other action that is commonly taken when a device has failed the posture assessment is that it is passed on to a remediation server which will then attempt to resolve the cause of the failed posture assessment it will do this with no user interaction required once it has remediated the device and it can pass the assessment it then goes through the process again and is allowed onto the network if it passes it's time to move on to the posture assessment process one of two types of Agents think software code is used on client devices during the assessment process it could be a persistent agent which is permanently loaded on the device and starts when the operating system loads this type of agent can provide more functionality than the other version a persistent agent is more likely to be used if that device regularly connects to the network the other type of agent is a nonpersistent agent when the client device attempts to access the network the agent is loaded onto the device to help in the assessment process once the assessment process is complet completed pass or fail the agent is removed from the device a nonpersistent agent would work best for a guest device when devices attempt to connect to the protected Network they are placed on a guest network with very limited access they are left on the guest Network until the assessment process is completed in some cases particularly when the client fails the antimalware check the client device may be placed into a quarantine Network which will only have access to a remediation server and it cannot move beyond that quarantine Network until it can successfully pass the posture assessment now that concludes this session on network access control I talked about Edge versus access control and then we concluded with some Access Control Concepts on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I trust you'll watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic forensic Concepts today I'm going to be discussing collecting the evidence and then we're going to have a discussion on what to do after the evidence has been collected I have a fair amount of ground to ever so let's go ahead and begin this session we will begin this session by talking about actually collecting the evidence the first step in basic forensics is the recognition that forensic measures need to take place as in that a security incident has occurred most of us at least hopefully will not need to deal with a murder mystery at least not in the workplace with that said it's almost certain that we will have to deal with some type of security or legal issue when supporting an organization's Network the response to security and legal issues needs to be done in a manner such that evidence is recorded and preserved the first step is recognizing that something has occurred which needs to be documented and that the evidence needs to be collected and preserved that's the first step in forensics at least as far as forensics pertains to network Administration Network administrators and technicians are quite often the First Responders to a security breach on it systems as such they have some responsibilities first off they need to secure the area and limit who has access as much as possible also do not power down computer systems the restricting of access and not powering down the system systems is done to protect possible evidence from being contaminated document everyone who has accessed the area after it has been secured this protects your chain of custody if necessary to stop an ongoing computer attack it is permissible to unplug the network cable from the computer but that's it once the area is secure if necessary now is the time to escalate the response depending upon the situation you may need to bring in Specialists or even the police no matter what it's important that the scene get documented thoroughly including what is on any computer monitors taking photographs is a great way to document the scene if photographs are taken they should be done with a polaroid type camera in film not with digital pictures it's harder to manipulate a Polaroid and therefore it's more believable than a digital image it may also be necessary to diagram to draw out the area also interview any witnesses as soon as possible before their memory starts to degrade or before they begin to collaborate on what story to tell also the electronic evidence collection process needs to begin as soon as possible and it needs to be collected by order of volatility so let's talk about the evidence and data collection process electronic evidence is volatile and easily corruptible just because of what it is it's magnetic data so the order of collection is important the first thing that should be collected are the contents of memory or Ram this is the most volatile of all types of data next are swap files they're not as volatile as random access memory but are still very temporary in nature then all Network processes need to be documented at least all of those that are active on the affected system or systems after documenting Network processes next up are the system processes and that is all system processes that are active on the affected system after that move on to file system information including the attributes of the files you need to do this before you do anything else so that you have completely documented the attributes of the files once all of that is done it's time to make a copy of all of the contents on all of the disk drives of the affected systems and that would be by raw disk blocks so let's talk about that a little bit more after isolating the affected system or systems from the network you need to create a bit level image of the system or systems that means an exact duplicate of the disk drives and actually you need to create two copies two images and with those two images you also need to create a message Mage digest of the image drives to be able to later prove that they have not been tampered with you can use md5 or sha as the hash algorithm to make that message digest one image should be securely stored to be used as evidence and with that should go the hashed image that way you can prove in court that it hasn't been tampered with the other image can be examined and modified in order to determine what exactly happened now let's move on to a discussion about what happens after the evidence has been collected and the first item is the chain of custody now this actually starts during the collection period and survives The Collection period on into the future the chain of custody is a document that identifies who collected the evidence when it was collected and who has had access to it since it has been collected proper chain of custody doc document can prove that the evidence has been accurately preserved and the chain of custody document can also be considered part of the evidence a chain of custody document will help to ensure that all the evidence that is collected is admissible in court a broken chain of custody will negate the collected evidence and by that if your chain of custody gets broken your evidence is no longer considered evidence so now let's talk about the Eis y process or the electronic Discovery process in legal situations the discovery process involves the exchange of evidence between both sides of a litigation or prosecution situation eisc Discovery refers to the Discovery process as it pertains to electronic data as in email database files or chat records any data that's kept in electronic format once identified in the Eis Discovery process a legal hold is placed on the data that has been identified a legal hold occurs when data has been deemed to be possibly relevant in either a prosecution or litigation situation if a legal hold occurs all normal processing of that data needs to cease that data needs to remain in the state that it was in during the ecovery process so a legal hold requires that back tapes not be recycled and that the normal archival process for that data be suspended until the legal hold is removed there are some items to consider when electronic data needs to be transported and it's considered evidence if it's physical evidence as in a hard drive a chain of custody document must be created for the transportation process and it needs to include an exact description of the evidence the means of Transport who received the evidence to transport it and who had access to the evidence during the transport process if you're using electronic means of transport a message digest should also be included to prove that the exact evidence sent is the evidence that is received once the forensic process has concluded or once the investigation has been completed a forensic report needs to be created based on the findings of the investigation during the evidence collection and investigation process the characteristics of the evidence should have been documented so you know what timestamps were present or any identifying properties that are associated with that evidence all of this information needs to be recorded and analyzed using scientific methods once completed the forensic report should be able to completely reconstruct and document the evidence a forensic report may be used in the litigation or prosecution process in addition a good forensic report may help in the creation of a better response plan for use in the future now that concludes this session on basic forensic Concepts I talked about collecting the evidence and then we concluded about what happens after the evidence has been collected on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on network troubleshooting methodology today I'm going to be talking about the importance of a methodology and then I'm going to cover the seven step troubleshooting methodology recommended by by comp Tia there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session we are going to begin by discussing the importance of a methodology first up is one of my favorite quotes concerning methodologies and it is my methodology is not knowing what I'm doing and making that work for me that's from Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam and unfortunately we don't quite have that kind of Liberty when it comes to troubleshooting networks all networks will require troubleshooting if you don't know where to start or haven't developed a methodology you will waste time and resources the complexity of modern networks means that there is a lot that can go wrong without a troubleshooting methodology your frustration levels and the frustration levels of those you support is going to rise a systematic trouble shooting methodology can significantly reduce the time required to resolve a problem and close a network trouble ticket saving both time and other resources it's time to move on to comp Tia's sevenstep troubleshooting methodology of course we're going to begin with step one which is identify the problem gather information what is actually occurring or not occurring is the problem extremely local as in relegated to your network or is the problem occurring in an area that is out of your control identify the systems remember the symptoms are not the problem they just point toward the underlying issue most often when the trouble ticket comes in it will have some of the symptoms but it will not have identified the actual problem approach multiple problems individually handle them one at a time question the users this needs to be done both politely and firmly many problems that are reported within a network are the result of the enduser needing to be educated or reeducated in proper procedures at the same time you also need to remember that most end users don't have your level of technical of technical knowledge so be patient but don't patronize and finally when identifying the problem determine if anything has changed this also requires a systematic approach so be very thorough step two is to establish a theory of probable cause make a list of all of the possible causes of the problem to develop this list of possible causes you should consider multiple approaches to the problem from bottom to top and then from top to bottom of the OSI model that is a great way to approach the problem from multiple Direction directions divide your list of possible causes into three ranked sections they should be not likely likely and most likely this will provide a great place to start when establishing your theory of probable cause remember to question the obvious if the network printer doesn't work check to be sure that it is turned on the third step is to test the theory of probable cause if the theory is confirmed move on to the next step if the theory is proven to be incorrect then reestablish a new theory of probable cause if you run out of probable causes or the situation worsens it may be time to escalate the issue up the troubleshooting chain once you've confirmed your theory of probable cause it's on to step four establish a plan of action and identify potential effects simple problem s may require a simple plan as in if the network printer doesn't work and the probable cause is that it's not turned on turn on the network printer more complex problems will require more complex plans in some cases it is a good idea to write the plan out step by step in order to determine the best course of action and to identify any possible repercussions that the resolution to the problem May introduce into the network step five is to implement the plan or to escalate the problem if you have the authority put your plan in action if you don't have the authority escalate the problem up the troubleshooting chain including all facts and determinations when you're escalating the problem don't make that next level above you have to recreate everything that you've done once you've implemented your plan it's on to step six verify full system functionality don't just verify that the original problem has gone away because sometimes a fix will introduce a new issue into the system if a new issue has occurred it's time to go back to Step One or to escalate the problem if you have verified full system functionality this is where you implement preventative measures to keep this problem from reoccurring and finally step seven document findings Act and outcomes document everything this will save time if and when the problem reoccurs your documentation may lead to new best practices for your organization it's important to document your missteps as well it will keep the next technician from making those same missteps that you have made and this will help to improve your chances of becoming the network support technician Rockstar in in your organization that concludes this session on network troubleshooting methodology I talked about the importance of a methodology and then I covered comp Tia's sevenstep troubleshooting methodology on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on TR shooting connectivity with utilities today I'm going to talk about connectivity utilities defined then I'm going to move on to connectivity utilities explained and we will conclude with some additional software for troubleshooting connectivity there's a fair amount of ground to cover let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with connectivity utilities defined before we can Define the utilities we need to Define Define connectivity connectivity is a program or devic's ability to connect or link to other programs or devices a connectivity utility is a utility or application that is used to establish connectivity and or to diagnose or fix a connectivity issue with that out of the way let's move on to connectivity utilities explained all modern operating systems come with prepackaged connectivity utilities designed to diagnose and or to repair connectivity issues in some cases you can use these utilities or programs from a graphical user interface or guei however in all cases you can use the following applications from the command prompt first up is Ping it is a simple utility that is used to determine if there's connectivity between two nodes or two endpoints it uses icmp Echo requests there are two basic formats to the Ping utility you can ping an IP address or you can ping the host name or the fully qualified domain name you can use ping 6 or ping minus 6 and you will ping only IPv6 hosts then there is Tracer or trace route it is a utility that is used to determine the path used between two nodes Tracer TR R A CER T is the windows version and trace route t r a c r o u t is the Linux Unix or OSX version of the command it also uses icmp Echo requests but it uses it with an incrementing time to live field to form queries and get responses each time the icmp echo request is sent out the TTL field is incremented by one and Tracer is used to determine how many routers are between two points it can be of limited value though as many routers have icmp disabled it uses the same basic format as ping then there is pathping it is a network connectivity utility that has been supplied in Microsoft operating systems since the introduction of NT path ping built upon the functionality of ping by combining it with Tracer when the application is used it will in effect perform a tracer command defining the path to the end node and then it will perform a ping test on each hop one disadvantage to path ping is that it requires 25 seconds per hop to show the Ping results and it uses the same command format as ping and Trace one of my favorite utilities is IP config or if config IP config is the windows version and if config is the Linux Unix OSX version it's used to determine the IP configuration of a given node it can also be used to change that IP configuration if used correctly when using to diagnose connectivity look for incorrect IP address es incorrect subnet masks incorrect DNS addresses and or an incorrect default gateway then there's ARP which stands for address resolution protocol ARP is used to correlate IP addresses to MAC address this utility can help to determine when there is an issue with an address resolution protocol table on a given node then we have NS lookup that stands for name server lookup it's supported by all major operating systems and it's used to diagnose domain naming system issues or DNS issues it can be very helpful in determining if a DNS server is having a problem dig is similar to NS lookup but it is specific to Unix Linux and OSX it does use different switch modifiers and returns slightly different results there is the route utility this is a Windows specific spefic command it's used to view and modify the routing tables on a Windows operating system node next up is NBT stat which stands for net bios over TCP statistics Windows implements the NBT protocol for backwards compatibility as a result the NBT stat utility is used if a net bios issue is suspected then there's net stat which stands for Network to statistics it's a utility that is used to display protocol statistics and current TCP IP network connections it's useful for determining if a connection has been made and the status of that connection it's time to move on to some additional software first up our throughput testers they're used to determine the data flow or bandwidth of a network they can be used internally to test the flow or bandwidth within a local area network or they can be used externally to test the flow of a Wan connection they are often used to create a baseline of network performance and last up we have protocol analyzers these are often called packet sniffers they examine Network behavior on a very basic level at the packet level they can examine all the packets coming into and out of an interface protocol analyzers are useful to see what is consuming network resources as in they can tell if a broadcast storm is occurring or if an interface is going bad wi shark is a common protocol analyzer that is often used and it's free that concludes this session on troubleshooting connectivities with utilities the first topic was connectivity utilities defined then we moved on to connectivity utilities explained and we concluded Ed with a brief discussion on some additional software on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on troubleshooting connectivity with Hardware today I'm going to discuss what makes a cable bad uh cable testing tools and I'm going to conclude with some additional tools I have a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we will begin with what makes a cable bad network cables can go bad or be bad without any visible indication alternatively a cable may be inappropriate for a particular application it can be difficult to visually tell if cables are wired correctly and or a break in The Wire may not be visible both of these will cause problem problems additionally anything that makes the cable fall out of specification will make it a bad cable how long is the cable is it over the maximum length is the cable rated for the amount of data being run over the wire all of these are questions that can be answered using the proper tools it's time to discuss cable testing tools first up is the multimeter it can be used to test for brakes and copper wiring good network cables have a very low resistance value from one end of the cable to the other by the way your resistance is measured in ohms a high or infinite ohms value indicates a break in the cable so you can use multimeters to test for continuity to make sure that traffic can flow from one end to the other crimpers are not a testing tool per se but they are used for attaching cable ends onto cables which if you suspect you have a bad cable in or a miswired connector you're going to need a set of crimpers it can either be specific to a particular type of cable end or it may work for more than one type of cable and by the way it's not uncommon to need to replace the ends of twisted pair wiring cables every network technician should have a cable tester or cable certifier these can be either fairly simple or very complex cable testers will test for continuity in the wire as in is there a break cable testers will also test for proper pinouts are all the wires in the right places some will test for the wiring standard is it wired for the t568a standard or the t568b standard or have you created a crossover cable cable certifiers are a little bit more complex but they will also test for more Network related items they can test the speed of the wire they can test for duplex settings between two endpoints cable certifiers are used to certify a given Network segment toner probes are another handy tool they're usually a twopiece set they have an injector which places a signal onto the wire in a probe which detects the signal and emits a tone when it detects that signal these are also sometimes called a Fox and Hound they're used to find and Trace wires they're useful when having to replace a single wire in a bundle of wires you can place the injector on one end to figure out which wire it is at the other end then there is the time domain reflectometer this is a cable tester or certifier that can also determine the length of a M they can also tell where a break is in a segment which can then allow you to put in a splice they are more expensive than a standard cable tester or certifier related to the TDR is the optical time domain reflectometer are the otdr they perform the same function as a TDR but it is used for fiber optic cabling it is often called a light meter as it can measure the quantity and quality of the light going through a fiber optic cable some other thoughts on cable testing tools unless your job entails mostly installing cabling the most important tools are the cable tester crimper and toner probes personally I have never been able to justify the cost of a TDR I have used them but I've rented them instead of purchased them most of the time you can make do with inexpensive tools however spending more on certain tools will usually save time and money in the long run an exception to the inexpensive tool rule are toner probes inexpensive toner probes can be difficult to work with or they just don't work at all I would recommend stepping up and spending a little bit more for your toner probe try to strike a balance between cost and Effectiveness you can spend thousands of dollars on some of these tools especially tdrs and otdrs and never utilize them to their fullest potential the next topic is additional tools and we will begin with the wireless analyzer it is a similar tool to the protocol analyzer but it is used for wireless networks it sniffs out packets on wireless networks this information can be used to help solve Wireless connectivity issues a wireless analyzer can also perform other functions it can check for bandwidth usage Channel usage top talkers and top listeners it can identify networks by passively scanning the radio frequency channels it can identify hidden networks if given enough time and a wireless analyzer can also infer non beaconing networks Based on data traffic so it can help you to find those Rogue access points then there are looking glass sites or LG sites these are publicly available sites that can be used to view routing information remotely as viewed from the LG serers point of view they create a readonly portal on which routing statistics can be generated and viewed LG sites can be helpful in determining if the connectivity issue is occurring because of problems on the local network or if the remote connection is the issue that concludes this session on troubleshooting connectivity with Hardware I talked about what makes a cable bad I talked about cable testing tools and I concluded with some additional tools on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on troubleshooting wire less networks part one today I'm going to be talking about configuration issues and then we will conclude with some other issues there's a fair amount of information to go over so let's go ahead and begin this session I will Begin by talking about some common configuration issues while wireless networks are a huge convenience to users they do introduce a new set of troubleshooting issues into the network not only do the stand standard issues that crop up in a wired Network need to be considered the added layer of complexity that adding a wireless access point brings to the table will also need to be considered when Wireless networking is brought into the mix a very solid troubleshooting methodology becomes just that much more critical now on to the actual configuration issues first up is the service set identifier configuration or the SS ID configuration when this is an issue the major symptom is that the user is unable to connect to the wireless network and the probable cause is an SSID mismatch the corrective measure is to check that the ssids match exactly remember they are case sensitive then there is encryption configurations it has the same symptom as the SSID misconfiguration the user is unable to connect to the wireless network probable cause is an encryption type mismatch or incorrect security key the possible corrective measure is to check the encryption settings on the wireless access point and on the device to make sure they are the same another configuration issue that can cause problems is an incorrect Channel or overlapping Wireless channels the symptom is that the user is unable to connect or the wireless network has very poor performance the probable cause is either incorrect channels or the overlapping channels is causing the signal to noise ratio to be reduced that's the SNR the possible corrective measure include adjusting the WAP settings and device settings so that they're using the same channel hence there are only three available nonoverlapping channels on the 2.4 GHz radio frequency then there are incompatibilities and the symptom is again the user is not able to connect to the wireless network the probable cause is you have an 802.11a device being used in an environment in which it won't work as in you're using 802.11g or n or there's a frequency mismatch between the wireless access point and the devices the the possible corrective measure is to make sure you're using equipment with compatible wireless standards untested updates can also cause a configuration issue the symptom again is the user is unable to connect or there is poor performance the probable cause is a conflict between the update and other configuration settings or the wireless network settings the possible corrective measure is to roll back the system to the prior conf configuration here's another Hint it is a best practice to make a backup copy of a system before installing any updates let's move on to other wireless issues troubleshooting networks requires a combination of Art and Science some of the best tools in Your Arsenal will be patience and strategic thinking network issues can express themselves in a multitude of ways one of the best things that you as a technician can do is to see if you can recreate the problem an issue that can be recreated can usually be resolved easily also remember that the users you are dealing with are the reason that you have a paycheck treat them as you would like to be treated even if it is the 10th time that you've reminded Bob that his username and password are case sensitive interference is a common issue on wireless networks the symptoms include slow performance Andor intermittent drops the probable causes can include overlapping channels walls or other equipment that operates in the same frequencies some possible corrective measures include changing the RF Channel or frequency or adjusting the wireless access point placement then there's poor signal strength the symptoms include slow performance and or intermittent drops especially towards the end of your wireless network coverage area probable causes include low RF power settings antenna type Andor the placement of the access point possible corrective measures include changing the RF power setting as in increasing it or adjusting the antenna and or WAP placement there is a caution here increasing your radio frequency power or adjusting the equipment placement may cause the signal to go where it was not intended to go so if you do either of those you need to check and make sure that you're not putting your signal where you don't want it to be bandwidth or device saturation can also become an issue the symptoms include slow performance Andor intermittent drops the probable cause is that there are too many users or applications for the available bandwidth possible corrective measures include increasing the number of wireless access points and or changing to a wireless standard with more throughput the wrong antenna type may also become an issue the symptoms include low or no signal in an area or signal in an area where it is not supposed to be the probable cause is the wrong antenna type for the coverage the corrective measure would be to change to an antenna type to suit the required coverage then there is signal bounce the symptom is poor performance in unexpected locations or an unexpected wireless network signal in an area that was not intended to be covered the probable cause is the RF signal bouncing off of a hard object the possible corrective measure would be to adjust the wireless access point placement that concludes this session on troubleshooting wireless networks part one I talked about configuration issues and then I moved on to some other wireless network issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on troubleshooting wireless networks part two today I'm going to be discussing Wireless environmental factors and then we're going to conclude with wireless standard related factors there's a whole lot of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Wireless environmental factors when planning and setting up a wireless network quite often environmental factors that may impact the wireless network are disregarded it is easy to get distracted by all the moving pieces of the wireless network as in the SSID configuration encryption and which standards to use dealing with these often leads to overlooking factors in the environment that may impact the quality of the planned Network to get the most out of a wireless network these factors need to be taken into consideration as they can have a major impact on the overall quality and performance of the in installed Network we don't think about it very often but building materials can influence wireless networks a wireless network works by sending and receiving radio frequency waves across a given area anything that can interrupt the signal or change the path of the waves can create a problem in the network this is called signal bounce the signal May return to the wireless access point out of phase leading to poor performance or dropped packets alternatively the signal may end up being bounced into areas where coverage was not planned leading to a security issue or an interference issue with other wireless networks some building materials of concern include concrete walls metal studs and Window Films particularly window tinting with the metallic content when evaluating environmental factors it is important to consider consider more than just the building materials all hard surfaces have the potential to create an out of phase or bounced signal including office furnishings and file cabinets using a wireless analyzer and wireless survey tools during the planning stage of a wireless network will lead to better placement of the wireless equipment which ultimately leads to a better performing Network let's move on to some wireless standard related factors first up is wireless standard compatibility not all of the 802.11 standards are compatible with each other this is partially due to the RF frequencies that are used and with the most common frequencies being the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz radio frequency band the problem with compatability can also be because of the type of modulation that is employed modulation is the encoding of information to be placed on a carrier wave and it's employed to put the signal on the network the most common forms of modulation are orthogonal frequency Division multiplexing ofdm and direct sequence spread Spectrum or dsss so let's look at a compatibility list for 802.11 802.11a is not compatible with most other standards 802.11b is compatible with 802.11g and N 802.11g is compatible with 11b and 11n 802.11n is compatible with 802.11b G and AC 802.11 AC is compatible with 802.11n so let's talk about the wireless standards 802.11b uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and dsss as its form of modulation it offers up to 11 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 460 ft 802.11a uses the 5 GHz RF band and ofdm as its method of of modulation 11a offers up to 54 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 390 ft then there's 802.11g it uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and it can use both ofdm and dsss as its methods of modulation 11g offers a to 54 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 125 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 460 ft then we have 802.11n it can use both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz radio frequency bands with ofdm as its method of modulation 802.11n can offer up to 600 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of of 230 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 820 ft finally we have 802.11ac it uses the 5 GHz radio frequency band with ofdm as its method of modulation it's expected to offer up to 1 gbits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft at this point in time we do not have a Maximum Outdoor range as there still working on establishing that that concludes this session on troubleshooting wireless networks part two we talked about some Wireless environmental factors and then we concluded with a brief discussion on wireless standard related factors on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to to pait's session on troubleshooting fiber cable networks today we're going to be talking about using the specific tool for the job and then we will conclude with some common fiber cable problems there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about using the specific tool for the job the nature of fiber optic networks makes troubleshooting them a little more expensive than other types of networks the reason for this is that the best and sometimes only tool that can be used for troubleshooting fiber optic cable problems is the optical time domain reflectometer or the otdr using the specific tool for the job at hand will ease the burden of diagnosing and resolving any network issues while an otdr costs thousands of dollars or in some cases tens of thousands of dollars in many cases it can quickly diagnose the problem a quick diagnosis can lead to a quick solution often saving significantly more than the cost of the tool by preventing lost productivity Andor Revenue that is why we spend money on otdrs so let's talk about some common fiber cable problems we're going to begin by talking about attenuation or deciel loss all Network Transmissions degrade over distance this is called attenuation or deciel loss this loss of signal strength can lead to slower speeds loss or Corruption of network traffic or the loss of the network communication link the otdr can not only diagnose attenuation but it can also help in the placement of a repeater station then there's broken Fiber Optic Cables as with all types of cable media fiber optic cables are subject to breakage as a matter of fact in some cases they are more delicate than other types of media certain types of fiber cable can span many kilometers making it difficult to determine where a break has occurred the otdr can be used to determine where a break in the fiber optic cable has occurred allowing the technician to insert a splice at that point a common cause of brakes and fiber optic CA is exceeding the bend radius limitations of the cable due to the construction of fiber optic cables it is subject to breakage if it is bent Beyond a certain point it is possible for small form factor plugable transceivers or for gigabit interface converter transceivers to go bad the SPF and gck transceivers are hot swappable replaceable modules that are used to add gigabit capabilities to switches routers and other networking equipment a bad transceiver will prevent communication from occurring and otdr can be used to help diagnose a bad SPF or gbck module it is possible to have a fiber type mismatch single mode fiber and multi mode fiber use different methods for placing the signal on the optic fiber if a mismatch occurs the most common problem is that it will be imp possible to make a network connection this is also referred to as a wavelength mismatch as the wavelength or color of the light being used is different between the modes of fiber transceivers the otdr can be used to determine the types of transceivers that are being used there are some other fiber optic cable issues that can arise anything that can interrupt the flow of light from transceiver to transceiver will create a problem dirt or smudges on the connectors may cause an issue with fiber optic cable Transmissions when this is suspected using a soft polishing cloth to clean the ends of the cable will solve the problem there is a caution never look directly into the ends of connected fiber optic cable if you do so you run the risk of damaging your eyes connectors are also specific to the mode of transmission as in SMF or MMF connecting the wrong type of connector to a cable will prevent proper communication from occurring also check to make sure that the proper connectors are being used with the proper type of fiber optic cables worn or broken connectors will create an air gap which will create a network transmission problem always inspect the connectors for their condition before use an otdr can be used to determine where the loss of signal is occurring even if it is at the connector that concludes this session on troubleshooting fiber cable networks we talked about using the specific tool for the job and then we concluded with common fiber cable problems on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you do watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace's session on troubleshooting common network issues today we're going to talk about problems that should be escalated and then we will conclude with problems that you should resolve there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin by talking about problems that an entrylevel network technician should escalate the complexity of mod modern networking is made using a solid troubleshooting methodology a necessity not an option networks can express problems and issues in many ways this can lead to much frustration on the part of the network users and the technicians responsible for fixing problems if such problems are not resolved quickly they can lead to loss of Revenue and productivity for an organization there are a number of problems that should be escalated up the troubleshooting chain as soon as they're discovered in order for them to be resolved in the most expedient manner the first of those problems is the switching Loop users complain that the network works fine for a while and then goes down and then works fine for a while and then goes down this indicates a spanning tree protocol convergence issue or a switching Loop in either case this is beyond the entry level technicians cap capabilities and should be escalated as soon as possible then there's the broadcast storm a failing Nick or application may cause a situation in which a broadcast storm is created the Nick goes down then comes back up then goes back down and it does this repeatedly this is often referred to as a flapping Nick each time it comes up it sends out a broadcast advertising its status which creates traffic congestion an application can do the same thing in either case escalate this up your support chain as soon as it's discovered similar to the switching Loop is the routing Loop but it involves the routing process this is more likely to occur when older routing Protocols are used but may also occur due to a misconfiguration of routers as in there are multiple static routes to the same location often switching to a newer routing protocol like OSF will resolve or banish routing Loops but this needs to occur farther up the support chain there are other routing problems that once discovered should be moved up the chain routing problems can manifest themselves in many different ways including missing IP routes failure to discover neighboring devices or failure to connect to neighboring devices once they're discovered when routing problems are suspected it is necessary to escalate the issue to the proper technical team one problem that can be difficult to diagnose is the mismatched maximum transmission unit or MTU this is often called an MTU black hole different types of Wan connections have different MTU settings that is the largest allowable size of a packet that can Traverse a link or be accepted by the link the MTU for ethernet by the way is 1,500 bytes routers will negotiate the MTU between links using icmp that's internet control message protocol if icmp has been disabled on the router which is a common practice when a router receives a packet that exceeds the MTU it will not respond and it will drop the packet the sending router continues to send the oversight packets into the MTU black hole never getting a response back that the packets are too big so the data is Flowing but it's not going anywhere when suspected this to should be moved up the support chain to the correct technical team Nick teaming can also create a problem this is the process of bonding multiple network interface controllers on a single system for the purpose of increasing bandwidth or for fail over purposes a misconfiguration may actually cause a loss of performance or in a worst case scenario the total loss of functionality if you're dealing with teamed Nicks move it up the support chain then there are power failure or power anomalies power failures are easy to diagnose but may be difficult to recover from while battery backup and generators May mitigate the issue they will not resolve the problem if the problem occurs within the building contact the appropriate group responsible for building maintenance if the problem occurs outside the building contact the appropriate utility electronic devices are sensitive to power issues anomalies in the quality of the electricity delivered to the device may cause problems using battery backups or uninterruptible power supplies with power conditioners will help to mitigate power anomalies with problems to escalate covered let's move on to problems that you can resolve we will begin with incorrect IP configurations under incorrect IP configurations we will begin with the default gateway the default gateway is the local network or computer's access to outside networks an incorrect Gateway will keep traffic from reaching its destination if it's suspected verify what the correct Gateway settings should be and correct it then there are duplicate IP addresses when duplicate IP addresses have been configured the first device booted up will get the address and the second one that gets booted up will get an address supplied by a Pippa this can occur when DHCP address reservation have not been configured correctly this is easy to verify and correct and should be done when an aipa address is received by a device there are other DHCP misconfigurations that can occur the problem is expressed in a similar manner as the duplicate IP address problem as in an a pipa address is supplied and is configured by a and is caused by a misconfigured DHCP server again verify your DHCP settings and correct then there are DNS misconfigurations users complain that they cannot get to resources or destinations on the network when using the host name DNS is used to resolve host names to IP addresses so a misconfiguration will prevent the function of the DNS process verify the correct DNS settings and correct as needed it's also possible to have incorrect VLAN assignments or incorrect virtual local area network assignments users will complain that they cannot get to necessary network resources this tends to be a single host issue or to involve a small group of hosts verify the VLAN settings and again correct as necessary incorrect interface configurations will also create network issues users May complain of poor Network performance or not being being able to connect to resources at all this issue tends to affect a whole network segment configuration issues could include mismatched Port speeds and or duplex settings on the interfaces verify the correct interface configurations and correct the settings simultaneous Wireless and wired connections will also create some networking issues many laptops come with wireless and wired Network capabilities built built into them it is possible for a laptop to attempt to use both at the same time this may cause the device to quit communicating on the network as a whole reminding users to turn off wireless capabilities before joining the wired network will resolve this problem not having good endtoend connectivity is another common problem the complexity of networks will just about guarantee that endtoend connectivity the ability to reach remote hosts will be lost at some point the Ping and Tracer utilities can be used to find where the breaking communication occurs this information can then be used to determine the next course of action last up is Hardware failure networking equipment and devices will fail when this happens it is usually denoted by the sudden loss or intermittent loss of networking fun functions or access the key to resolving this issue is in determining what has failed and replacing it that concludes this session on troubleshooting common network issues I began by talking about problems that should be escalated and then I concluded with problems that should be resolved on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common network security issues today I'm going to be discussing security issues caused by misconfiguration and then I will conclude on other network security issues with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about security issues caused by misconfiguration it's easy to assume that a network is secured from threats while in reality it may be very vulnerable a network may actually be vulnerable because of a misconfigured security setting or because of a common practice within an organization a network may not be as secure as you think due to the everchanging threat landscape nefarious hackers are continually seeking new exploits that they can use to breach network security including possible misconfigurations in network security settings the security settings may have been correct at the time that they were set up but due to the changing landscape they may be considered a misconfiguration now a misconfigured firewall Andor Access Control list may cause a security issue these can result in three different categories of security issues traffic that should be blocked isn't allowing threats in traffic that shouldn't be blocked is this can prevent the receiving of vital updates or all traffic is blocked this isn't necessarily a security issue per se but it is still a misconfiguration and it is possible for a junior network administrator to just remove the access control list or firewall to allow the traffic to start flowing again which is a security issue to protect against a misconfigured firewall or ACL thoroughly test them before putting them into action a misconfigured application may become a security threat a web application that does not perform proper validation of input may lead to a buffer overflow attack this may lead to a successful attack on the web server on which it is hosted thoroughly testing applications before placing them into service will mitigate the threat unpatched operating system or firmware will become a major security issue quickly the manufacturer of operating systems and Hardware firmware will often produce security patches or fixes for vulnerabilities as they become known an unpatched OS or firmware becomes very vulnerable in short order and may become a threat to the network most software makers have an updating service subscribing to that service will help to mitigate the threat open TCP IP ports are a security issue open ports on networks are listening for requests for or by Services applications or protocols all open ports are a security vulnerability and there are 65,535 possible ports that may be open a best practice for Network Security is to specifically close all unnecessary ports to harden a network the tacx plus and radius services are often used to authenticate devices and users on networks a misconfiguration on either may lead to a security issue that allows malicious users to be authenticated to use network resources thoroughly reviewing the configuration of authentication services will help to mitigate the problem in addition all default local accounts should be disabled these default local accounts may present a slight opening for a malicious user to exploit authentication Services active default usernames and passwords are an issue almost all devices and applications come with default usernames and passwords to ease the setup process if left active these defaults create a security issue as they tend to be well known or are easy to find through simple research a best practice is to disable all default usernames and passwords after setting up the device or application it's time to move on to other network security issues first up are malicious users malicious users may be the single biggest security issue facing any network and they will fall into one of two categories there is the untrusted malicious user this is an outside entity that has exploited a security weakness to gain access to network resources as in a hacker who has breached a databases security features to gain access to valuable information even worse than the untrusted malicious user is a trusted malicious user this this is a person or entity that has been explicitly granted access to network resources that then exploits this trusted position for malicious purposes and they are harder to guard against because you've already granted them access inside of your defenses a best practice is to review log files on a regular basis to see what resources are being accessed and by whom to help maintain security packet sniffers are also a security issue packet sniffers examine Network traffic at a very basic level and can be used to help in the administration of a network but packet sniffers may also be used by malicious users to see what protocols and activities are allowed on the network this may help them in further attacking the network then there is malware it is usually defined as malicious software that has the intent of causing harm as a category malware covers any codebased threat to a network or system examples of malware include viruses Trojans and spyware to protect against malware antimalware applications should be running on every device to be proactive enduser education should also be in place to teach them to recognize the dangers that malware presents the internet control messaging protocol itself may become a security issue icmp can be a valuable tool for diagnosing issues on networks but it can also become a security vulnerability icmp can be exploited in a denial of service type of attack icmp can also be used to redirect legitimate users to a new malicious default gateway possibly resulting in loss of data or or sensitive information it is now a best practice to deny icmp requests on a router's outwardfacing interface denial of service or distributed denial of service attacks are becoming more common in an attempt to bring down a network or website malicious users will often send thousands or hundreds of thousands of requests for service the attacker's goal is to make that resource unreachable by legitimate users many modern firewalls and other network appliances have been configured to recognize the signature of such an attack and can take steps to mitigate the results when creating applications developers often create back doors into the programs back doors are a method of accessing an application or service while bypassing the normal authentication process unfortunately these back door doors are sometimes left open after the development process has been completed once these become known they can be exploited in most cases the application is listening on a specific port for a request for access the best mitigation technique is to close all unnecessary ports on a network kind of sounds familiar doesn't it then there's jamming all wireless networks use radio frequency channels to transmit data on the network it is possible to create enough interference on the RF channel that it is no longer usable on the network an attacker will often use jamming when performing a denial of service type attack however it can also be used to perform an evil twin type attack by jamming the legitimate channel the attacker is hoping that users will switch to the channel That the Rogue access point is transmitting on many of the modern networking standards and devices employ techniques to mitigate the threat of jamming as in both 802.11n and 802.11 AC are difficult to jam standards then there is Banner grabbing many network devices display banners when users are signing into are requesting services from network devices these banners can impart information about the type of device or the type of service that is being requested this information may be used by a hacker to research possible exploits the best practice is to disable all unnecessary services and Banners on network devices that concludes this session on common network security issues I began by talking about security issues caused by misconfiguration and then I concluded with other networks security issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope I get to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common W components and issues today I'm going to be talking about common wide area network components and then we're going to move on to Common Wan issu isues there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about common Wan components first up our copper line drivers or repeaters these are used to allow Network traffic to go farther distances over copper wire type networks they take an incoming signal and regenerate it boosting the strength of that signal and then they send send it back out thus reducing attenuation common to all WS is the Demar Demar stands for the demarcation point this is the physical point where the telecommunication company's responsibility ends and the customers Begins the tel code takes care of the Upstream end of the network and the customer takes care of the downstream end of the network the dmark may be simple or it may be very complex depending upon the size of the organization and the required Services then there is the network interface unit or the NIU in the Soho environment the NIU is usually the DeMark also in the Soho environment the NIU is usually provided by the internet service provider or ISP and NIU can be a cable modem a DSL modem or another piece of Hardware that connects the customer to the ISP one type of NIU is the smartjack it's an NIU that can provide feedback on conditions to the ISP smart jacks help the ISP determine if a problem exists on its end of the dmark through the use of remote loop back capabilities Min smart Jacks can also provide translation between protocols as in translating a Serial PPP communic ation stream into ethernet more than likely on larger networks you will find CSU dsus that's Channel Service Unit digital service units this is the interface point that provides the connection between a pointtopoint line and the device that is directing Network traffic which is usually a router the CSU DSU may be an external device or it may be a removable module inside of a router only two c CSU dsus may exist on a single point topoint line one at either end of the connection with the common components covered let's move on to common wide area network issues first up is a loss of internet connectivity many factors can lead to a loss of connectivity on both sides of the DeMark before contacting the WAN provider check the local area network equipment for it operation if the issue is not to be found on the land side then contact the wide area network provider one of the tests that the WAN provider will conduct is a loop back test to check its line for interference DNS issues are also common in a Wan environment they may look like a loss of internet connectivity but it isn't the users May complain that they cannot connect to an outside Source like ww ww.google.com but it may not actually be a connectivity issue but a DNS issue if using a local DNS server verify the settings and make Corrections accordingly if the network is using the WAN providers DNS settings attempt to Ping the IP address if that works there is a Wan connection and if you then use the Ping utility with the fully qualified domain name and this fails then contact the Lan provider to resolve their DNS issue interface issues are also common errors on a router's w interface can indicate several different issues monitoring an interfaces status in reading the error reports May provide a clue as to the issue the most common issue that prevents a good connection is a speed or duplex mismatch a speed mismatch between interfaces will prevent a link from being established a duplex mismatch between the interfaces will create errors as in output and input errors if you're experiencing discards and drop packets there's a couple of things to consider if the device is discarding incoming packets then more than likely the device's CPU is being over utilized it may be time to upgrade if the device is dropping outgoing packets then there is a bandwidth congestion issue which may be caused by interference on the line so either you may be trying to move too much Network traffic or there may be an issue on the wide area network providers side of the line router configurations are a common problem when establishing a new W connection a misconfiguration of the WAN interface of a router will lead to guess what a w connection issue if this is suspected verify the proper configuration settings with the WAN provider unfortunately company policy and practices sometimes get reported as a wide area network issue some applications may be throttled or have their available bandwidth reduced for quality of service reasons leading to slow service which is a perceived wide area network issue also acceptable use policies May restrict or block access to certain sites or types of sites which may appear to the end user as a when issue there's not much that you as the technician can do to resolve this but it is up to you to explain it to the end user a satellite wide area network connection may also become an issue if a satellite Wan connection is used latency will increase due to the distance distances covered by the Transmissions latency is the measure of time between the sending of data and the receiving of the data careful application of quality of service techniques May mitigate the effects of latency on some applications but you're still going to have more latency with a satellite connection than other types of connections split Horizon is another issue split Horizon is a technique used in routing to help prevent routing loops with split Horizon a router will not advertise a route to another Network out of the interface that it learned the route on with a point to multipoint wide area network connection the router may have difficulty with split Horizon it will learn all of the routes available to it on the same interface but it can't advertise those routes back out of that interface creating logical iCal sub interfaces on the wide area network interface will usually resolve this problem The Logical sub interfaces appear to the router as individual interfaces allowing the router to advertise the routes back out of the WAN interface that concludes this session on common Wan components and issues I talked about common W components and then I concluded with some common wide area networ NW work issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I am Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the OSI networking reference model today I'm going to begin by talking about a brief history of the reference models and then I'm going to talk about the network reference models themselves and then I'm going to conclude with a comparison between OSI and TCP IP there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session so let's begin with a brief history the open system interconnection reference model is a conceptual model with two major components the first main component of the OS I networking reference model is an abstract model of networking it's a seven layer model the second major component is a set of specific protocols which allow differing Computing systems to communicate with one another despite their different architecture so why was a networking model required well early networks communicated using proprietory languages because of those proprietory Lang languages early networks could only communicate with like systems so an IBM Network could only communicate with another IBM Network in addition to that the US government desired a robust computer communication system that could survive disaster the first networking reference model that was developed was the TCP IP reference model the transmission control protocol Internet Protocol reference model was published as the United States Department of Defense standard in 1982 all of the major systems manufacturers adopted the TCP IP reference model beginning in 1984 AT&T moved the Unix implementation of tcpip to open source in 1989 further cementing TCP IP's place in networking the OSI reference model came later than the TCP IP reference model The OSI model was published in 1983 and it defines the relationships between differing protocols and Hardware it's time to move on to a discussion about the networking reference models in more detail we're going to begin with the OSI reference model it is a seven layer reference model layer one is also called the physical layer it standardizes the electrical signals that networks use it also defines cable standards and how the bits of data are placed on the physical media network cables and hubs are part of layer one of the OSI model then there's Layer Two which is also called the data link layer it's responsible for identifying the individual nodes both the sending node and and the receiving node it also introduces an error correction method known as the frame check sequence or FCS Layer Two is composed of two Su layers the first of those is The Logical link control layer it is mainly responsible for flow control and error correction then there is the media Access Control layer it is mainly responsible for node addressing switches and bridges are layer 2 devices then there's layer three the network layer it's responsible for routing functions between networks it also identifies networks and nodes on the network routers are layer three devices then there's layer four the transport layer it's responsible for breaking the data into smaller pieces for the lower layers and for the actual data transport protocol calls two of which are TCP and UDP the transport layer may be required to confirm the actual delivery of the data stream and it may be required to offer error correction and it does this through the use of TCP or transmission control protocol then there's layer five the session layer this is the layer that is responsible for establishing the initial parameters between two systems it sets up up and tears down the communication Channel layer six or the presentation layer is responsible for taking data and converting it from a machine dependent language to a machine independent language this is also the layer that has the main responsibility for encryption between networks and finally we have layer s the application layer this is the layer that is responsible for the protocol OLS that request services or functions from other systems these protocols may not be the actual application for instance Internet Explorer is an application that uses HTTP at layer 7 to request web pages now let's talk about the TCP IP reference model this is a four layer reference model the lowest layer is the network interface face layer which can also be known as the link layer it handles electrical signaling flow control error detection and node addressing then there's the internet layer this layer handles routing functions and identifies Network systems and nodes on those networks then there is the transport layer which handles breaking the data into more manageable pieces for the lower layers it is also the layer that is is responsible for the delivery method which can be either reliable or unreliable and error correction for when reliable delivery is used and finally there is the application layer this layer handles requests for services from applications it also handles translation to machine independent languages and encryption it also sets up and tears down communication sessions between system so now let's do a comparison between the OSI and TCP IP reference models while tcpip is the dominant model most technicians communicate issues using the OSI model because it is more specific when a problem occurs and believe me they will it is easier to resolve them with the more highly defined set of specifications of the OSI model versus the specifications of the TCP IP model it's easier to revolve an issue at the session layer of the OSI model than it is to track down what went wrong in the application layer of the TCP IP model both the OSI and TCP IP models are reference models only it is not mandatory that they be followed each developer and manufacturer determines if its own method of implementing the reference models while in theory there will never be a problem in communicating between devices and systems remember it is only a theory now that concludes this session on the OSI networking reference model I began with a brief history then I moved on to the networking reference models themselves and then I did a very brief OSI and TCP IP comparison on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on the transport layer plus icmp today I'm going to discuss TCP and UDP and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on I CM there's a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about TCP and UDP before I can talk about TCP and UDP we need to talk about the transport layer most networking models follow the open Systems interconnection reference model or the OSI model it is composed of seven different layers which include the application presentation session transport network data link and physical layers the layers work together to create a system of communication that allows for different types of computing systems or networks to communicate with each other layer four also known as the transport layer receives data from the session layer which is layer five and determines what method or type of delivery is required for the data the transport layer then hands that data with the instructions for the method of delivery to layer three which is also known as the network layer which is then responsible for determining where the data is actually going there are two main transport layer protocols they are TCP and UDP TCP or the transmission control control protocol is a protocol that determines the type of delivery method that will be used in network communications TCP uses a reliable method to deliver Network packets TCP helps to set up the connection session it helps to establish error control during the communication session and it helps to tear down the communication session when it's done now TCP does use a reliable delivery method one of the main ways that it does this is through the use of a threeway handshake the first step of this handshake is the request for the connection the second step is the reception of the response from the other end the third part of the threeway handshake is when the requestor sends an acknowledgement back that sets the sequence numbers that will be used with every packet that is delivered every packet that gets sent must must be acknowledged by the receiver if the sender doesn't receive the acknowledgement of a packet the sender will then resend that packet all packets are sent and received in order they're never out of order are they should never be out of order so now let's talk about UDP or user datagram protocol it's a protocol that determines the type of delivery method that will be used in network communication just like TCP unlike TCP UDP uses an unreliable method to deliver Network packets it does not help to set up the connection session it does not establish error control and it does not help to tear down the communication session it uses an unreliable delivery method this could better be described as a best effort delivery method it sends the data dat stream to the destination trusting that the destination is a listening for the data stream and B willing to accept that data stream the data stream flows with no acknowledgment of it being received that's how UDP works not all communication can be treated the same that is why there are both reliable and unreliable delivery methods with TCP the sender can be a assured that the other end of the line has received all of the packets that were sent and that the packets were received in the proper order this works well for communication that is not sensitive to latency issues that are associated with the overhead of reliable deliveries UDP strips off the overhead but sacrifices reliability it is well suited for network communication in which speed is more important than reliability when using voice over IP it is more important for the flow of packets to be continuous than for communication to be held up while waiting for packets to arrive in the right order Voiceover IP communication can survive the occasional drop packet but it gets very miserable when it has to wait for those packets to arrive now let's move on to ICM the internet control message protocol works at layer three which is also known as the network layer of the OSI reference model and it is used by IP or the Internet Protocol to perform several Services as a messaging service for IP icmp packets are carried as encapsulated IP datagrams it provides information about network issues the Ping utility uses icmp test for endtoend connectivity between two devices using icmp Echo request packets the trace route utility uses a combination of icmp echo requests and destination unreachable packets to map the actual route between two endpoints also if a router's memory buffers are full it will continue to send out icmp buffer full messages until the congestion has been reduced this allows the other routers to slow down their Transmissions to avoid packet loss that concludes this session on the transport layer plus icmp I began with a brief discussion on TCP and UDP and I concluded with another brief discussion on icmp on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on basic Network Concepts part one today we're going to be talking about encapsulation and modulation there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin by talking about encapsulation the open Systems interconnection reference model or the OSI model uses a layered approach to enable disparate devices to be able to communicate effectively during the communication between two devices or nodes each layer is only responsible for being understood by the corresponding layer on the other device as data flows down from the application layer through to the physical layer it is encapsulated at each layer with information to help the corresponding layer at the other end of the communication line understand what is happening as the data is received at the other end it is De encapsulated or unwrapped as it moves up the OSI stack by the corresponding layer let's talk about how encapsulation works the application layer begins the process by sending data that is encapsulated or wrapped with application layer control information to the presentation layer the encapsulated data is called a pdu or protocol data unit the application layer pdus are segmented by the presentation layer with each segment being encapsulated by presentation layer control information they are now presentation layer pdus the process of segmenting and encapsulating continues down through the OSI stack until it is transmitted as bits by the physical layer the receiving physical layer passes the bits to the receiving data link layer which reads the data link layer pdu information and then de encapsulates and Des segments it sending the new packets to the network layer as Network layer pdus the process of De encapsulating in D segmenting continues up the OSI stack until it is received by the application layer where it is finally fully de encapsulated and fully reassembled this encapsulation and de encapsulation allows differing systems to be able to communicate together effectively with that covered let's move on to modulation the physical layer of the OSI stack is responsible for transmitting bits of data across some form of media so it literally is responsible for transmitting zeros and ones across the media like a cable the question arises how does the physical layer transmit the data across the media the bits of data are modulated or encoded by the physical layer and placed on the carrier signal of the media which carries the modulated data onto its next destination the carrier signal can also be referred to as the carrier Channel Once the bits are received they are demodulated or unencoded by the receiving physical layer a carrier signal is a standard wave form usually in the form of a sine wave that is used as the base carrier of another input signal a sine wave is a mathematical curve that is represented by a smooth repeating oscillation now let's Define modulation modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a carrier signal with an input signal usually for the purposes of conveying information modulation can be used to encode digital Network traffic onto media that uses a digital carrier signal as in using an ISDN connection between two networks modulation can also be used to encode a digital signal onto a media that uses an analog carrier signal as in digital Network traffic traveling over the public switched telephone Network or pstn multiplexing is often ten used with modulation multiplexing can be used to increase the number of modulated signals that can be placed onto a carrier signal so let's talk about multiplexing and I don't mean your local movie theater the type of carrier signal will determine if multiplexing can occur a baseband carrier signal cannot have multiplexing occur as the modulated signal will consume all of the available frequency or Channel weight with multiplexing can be utilized on a Broadband carrier Channel as each modulated input is assigned a portion of the Channel width of the carrier channel multiplexing can use one of two methods to weave streams of modulated signal into the carrier signal there's frequency division multiplexing this is the process of mathematically dividing the carrier channel frequency into multiple segments and assigning the results to modulated input signals then there is time division multiplexing this is the process of mathematically dividing the carrier Channel width into multiple time segments and assigning the time slots to different modulated signal input streams it's time to talk about the difference between a baseband and Broadband carrier Channel and we're going to begin with baseband a simple definition of baseband is a stream of data that is sent over a carrier Channel as is a digital modulated signal the digital signal will take all of the carrier signals available frequency or time while the modulated input does take all of the carrier channels available frequency the communication is bidirectional it can flow back and forth a simple definition of a Broadband carrier channel is a stream of data that is sent over a carrier Channel as an analog modulated signal the analog signal will be assigned a portion of either the carrier channels available frequency or time while the modulated input doesn't take all of the carrier channels available frequency the communication is not bidirectional for twoway communication to take place Multiplex channels must be created that is a channel for each Direction now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part one I began with with encapsulation and I concluded with modulation on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on basic Network Concepts part two today we're going to be talking about Network transmission Concepts and then we're going to conclude with CSM CD and CS ma CA there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the network transmission Concepts the first concept is wavelength wavelength is a measurement of the distance between peaks in a wave pattern emitted by electromagnetic radiation as in in light waves radio waves or microwaves each type of electromagnetic radiation falls into a specific range of wavelengths by modifying a wavelength data can be encoded into the wavelength and transmitted to a receiving device which then decodes the transmission then there's B rate and bit rate the B rate was originally used to measure the speed of a telegraph transmission it is a measure of the number of State changes in a given period of time the usual state change that was measured was electricity as in the number of times the state changed from .5 volts to 1.5 volts the bit rate is a measure of the number of zeros and ones that can be transmitted across the medium in a given period of time so it is a measure of the actual bits that can be transmitted it is usually measured in bits per second or BPS the bit rate is a more accurate measure of transmission throughput than the B rate then there's sampling size when converting from an analog audio signal to a digital signal a computer or other device captures the analog audio waveform and mathematically converts the captured sample into different wavelengths which is how we get the discrete sounds this occurs over a specific period of time which is called the size of the sample or the sampling size and finally there's carrier detect and carrier sense carrier detect is when a device can only tell when a carrier signal or channel is present by the reception of a control signal the presence of the control signal signifies that Transmissions can occur the control signal controls the order of Transmissions so data collisions are not possible the control signal can also be used to establish the maximum speed of the transmission that can be used carrier sense is when a device uses feedback from a receiver to determine if a carrier channel is present if a carrier signal is detected the device can send Transmissions data transmission collisions are possible with carrier sense and that logically leads us into csmac CD and csmac CA the carrier detect method of network transmission works well when there are just a few nodes that need to be connected together however as the number of nodes that need to transmit increase the efficiency of carrier detect begins to decrease to the point where it can become unmanageable although the carrier sense method of network transmission is not as efficient when the scale of the network is small as the number of nodes increases it becomes more efficient than the carrier detect method so let's talk about csmac CD or Carrier sense multiple access with Collision detection csmac CD of course uses the carrier sense method of network transmission every device on the network uses feedback from a receiver to determine if a carrier channel is present every device connected to the network has an equal opportunity to place a transmission on the carrier Channel That's the multiple access part of the name before placing a transmission on the carrier Channel a device will listen to the channel to determine if another node is transmitting if it detects a signal on the carrier channel the node will wait before attempting to transmit if no signal is detected the node is free to send if two devices send a transmission at the same time a collision between the Transmissions is possible sending devices will listen for transmission collisions if a collision is detected a jamming signal is sent informing all nodes that a collision has taken place all devices that receive the jamming signal will wait for a random amount of time before attempting to transmit now let's talk about CSM CA or Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance CS maaca operates in the same manner as csmac CD with one exception it uses a collision avoidance scheme through the use of a controlling device before attempting to send data a device will place a specific signal on the network called a request to send packet or RTS packet if no other device is utilizing the network the controlling device will respond with another specific signal called a clear to send packet or CTS packet once the sending device receives the CTS it knows it can send a transmission without a collision occurring csmac CD is better suited for highspeed High throughput networks and is the specified Network transmission standard for the 802.3 ethernet networking standard as it has a low amount of network overhead CSA is better suited for lower speed lower throughput types of networks where the possibility of data Collision is higher it is the specified standard for 802.3 wireless networks or WiFi networks now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part two I began with network transmission Concepts and I concluded with a brief discussion on csmac CD and Cs maaca on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to paace it session on basic Network Concepts part three today we're going to be talking about numbering systems and we will conclude with a very brief discussion on conversion tables with that let's go ahead and begin today's session of course I'm going to begin by talking about numbering systems while computer code and communication can get very complex it can also be broken down to a basic bit level a bit has one of two values it either has a value of zero or it has a value of one these values can be thought of as being either off which is a zero or on a one these bit values are actually the only information that Computing devices know by combining and adding different bits together computers can communicate with each other and programs can be created because of this technicians need to know how to work with binary or the base 2 numbering system binary is a base 2 numbering system where each position has one of two basic values it is either a zero or a one it is written from right to left with the potential value of digits being doubled with each additional digit that's added if a zero is the placeholder it has a null value or no absolute value and if a one is present the actual value is double the potential value of of the digit to the right to derive the final value of a binary number add all of the potential values together and that will give you the decimal value of the binary number the binary numbering system is very important when dealing with computers and networking you should become comfortable with converting from decimal or base 10 values to Binary and from binary back to the decimal format if you need help with that there are multiple websites that can help one website that I recommend is mathisfun.com you can look on their website for their binary numbering lessons now let's talk about bit bite and nibble a bit is a single zero or one a bite is8 bits and it can also be referred to as an octet a nibble is half of a bite or four bits and these terms are used quite frequently when dealing with binary now let's talk about heximal heximal is a base 16 numbering system that uses the numbers 0 through 9 and then it uses the letters a through F to represent the values 10 through 15 it functions in the same manner as binary but with base 16 each hexadecimal digit has a potential binary value of 1 1 1 1 or 15 and it can be referred to as a nibble as it's half of a bite a heximal number can often be recognized by the notation prefix of zero lowercase x which directly precedes the heximal number heximal is widely used in programming and networking along with binary some examples of binary and heximal use include ipv4 addresses which can be represented by a 32bit binary number that is divided into four 8bit sets each 8bit set is equal to one BTE and is often called an octad an IPv6 address which is a 128bit binary number is usually represented by hexadecimal and it is divided into eight two byte sets each set being separated by colons and I recommend that you watch my presentations on ipv4 and IPv6 to get a better understanding of how binary and hexadecimal are used in networking and now let's move on to conversion tables when working with binary and hexadecimal numbers I recommend creating a conversion table before doing the math I find it to be very useful when I need to convert from decimal to Binary or from heximal to binary to decimal now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part three I began by talking about numbering systems and I concluded with a very brief discussion on conversion tables on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace it session on the introduction to wireless standards today I'm going to talk about CS MAA and then I'm going to conclude with a discussion on wireless standards there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about CSM CA all Wireless ethernet standards employ an algorithm called carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance that's csma CA a csma CA Network involves a method of transmission that avoids packet collisions once a wants to send a packet it listens to the carrier wave if no other node is transmitting it will then transmit if another node is transmitting it will wait a random amount of time and then listen to the carrier wave again to see if it's free to send this differs from a csmac CD which stands for Collision detection type of network which is all about how to transmit after a collision has occurred now let's talk about frequency modulation frequency modulation is the process used to encode data into a carrier wave 802.11 uses two main frequency modulation methods the first one is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or ofdm ofdm is a frequency division multiplexing scheme that uses multiple subcarrier channels to carry data it is used to mitigate against attenuation which is loss of signal strength over distance and multipath issues that exist in networking the other frequency modulation method is direct sequence spread Spectrum or dsss dsss is a modulation technique that uses spread Spectrum technology to affect data transfer it is used to mitigate the problem of multiple users on a channel and for Effective timing between the transmitter and the receiver now let's move on to the wireless standards Wireless networking standards are established by the 802.11 committee of The Institute of electrical and electronics Engineers or the i e quite often the term WiFi is used to describe an 802.11 Network which is technically incorrect WiFi is actually a reference to the wifi Alliance which is responsible for certifying that wireless networking equipment actually meets the 802.11 standards WiFi has become synonymous with the wireless local area network in the English language so don't be surprised if you find yourself using the term Wii when you really mean 802.11 now let's talk about the standards and first up is 802.11a it has a maximum speed of 54 megabits per second and it operates on the 5 GHz frequency band it uses ofdm as its form of modulation and has a maximum distance of 150 ft 80211 a is compatible with 802.11 AC then there's 802.11b it has has a maximum speed of 11 megabits per second and it operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11b uses dsss as its technique for modulation it has a maximum distance of 300 ft and it is compatible with 802.11g and 802.11n now let's move on to 802.11g it has a maximum speed of 5 4 megabits per second and it also operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11g can use ofdm and dsss for its modulation techniques it has a maximum distance of 300 ft 802.11g is compatible with 802.11b and 802.11n now talking about 802.11n it has a max maximum speed of up to 600 megabits per second and it can operate on both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz frequency band it does use ofdm as its form of modulation it offers a maximum distance of 300 ft 802.11n is compatible with 11b 11g and 11 a with the introduction of 802.11n We Now find Mimo multiple input multiple output it's a technology that allows for the increase in speed for the wireless network with 11 in there can be up to four antennas which allow for up to four separate spatial streams and finally we have 802.11 AC now 802.11 AC offers speed anywhere from up to 433 megabits per second up to multiples of gigabits per second and it operates on the 5 GHz frequency band it uses ofdm as its method of modulation but its implementation is an advanced form of ofdm 11 AC offers a theoretical maximum distance of 300 ft 11ac can be compatible with 11a G or n when 802.11 AC was introduced the improved the mimo technology which now allows for up to eight antennas which means that there can be up to eight separate spatial streams of data now that concludes this session on the introduction to wireless standards I began this discussion by talking about CSM CA and then I concluded with a brief discussion on the wireless standards on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to wired Network standards today I'm going to be discussing the Tia eia 568a and tia eia 568b standards then I'm going to move on to ethernet standards and I'm going to conclude with some other standards I have a whole lot of information to cover but not not a whole lot of time so let's dive into today's session of course I'm going to begin with the Tia eia 568a and 568b wired standards the Tia eia 568a and 568b standards deal with twisted pair wires these are the two cable pinout standards that are regulated by the Tia eia that the Telecommunications industry Association electronic Industries Alliance the pinout standard specify The Ordering of the wires to ensure that proper networking communication can take place the t568a standard is white green green white orange blue white blue orange white brown brown on the other hand the t568b standard is white orange orange white green blue white blue green white brown brown all modern ethernet networks that utilize unshielded twisted pair UTP or shielded twisted pair STP should use the Tia eia standards as a quick refresher for twisted pair wiring here are some common tools that you will need there are wire strippers these are used to remove the insulating jacket from the cable then there are crimping tools these are used to sec secure the wires into modular connectors then there are punchdown tools these are used to secure wires into punchdown blocks and finally there are cable testers these are used to test the Integrity of the network cables that you've just created with that covered let's move on to ethernet standards first up our distance limitations twisted pair copper wire is limited to 100 m without a repeater unless otherwise stated coaxial land cabling is limited to either 185 or 500 M depending upon the coaxial cable that is used as an example a 10base 2 coaxial Network uses RG58 and is limited to 185 m in length on the other hand a 10 base5 coaxial network using rg8 is limited to 500 m with fiber optics land transmission is limited by the cable type that is used the current maximum is over 40 km over a single mode optical fiber or SMF fiber now let's talk about twisted pair cable standards there's 10base T that's 10 megabits per second using UTP over a minimum of c 3 cable then there's 100 Bas T that's 100 megabits per per second using a minimum of cap 5 you can also have 100 Base TX this is 100 megabits per second networking using two pair over a minimum of cap 5 then there's 1,00 Base TX this is 1 gbits per second networking using two pair over a minimum of cap 5e cable then there's 10 gbas T that is 10 gbits per second networking using a minimum of cat 6 but it's only good for 40 m finally there's also 10 gbas T that's 10 gigabits per second networking using a minimum of cat 6A cabling but that's good for up to 100 m now let's move on to the multiable standard and that's 1,000 base X under this standard there's 1,000 base SX which is 1 gbit per second networking over a short distance multimode fiber and it's usually less than 2 km then there's 1,000 base elx this is 1 gbits per second networking over long distance single mode fiber and it's usually a greater span than 2 km and finally there's 1,000 CX this is 1 gbits per second networking over a coaxial cable that can be up to 25 M long now let's talk about 10 GB networking first up there's 10 gbas Sr over multimode fiber and it's good for up to 300 M then there's 10 gbas LR over single mode fiber which is good for up to 10 km then we have 10 gbas er which is over single mode fiber and it's good for up to 40 km then we have 10 gbas s SW this runs over MMF and it's good for up to 300 M and it's used on a wide area network then there's 10gb LW which runs over SMF up to 10 km and it's also used in a wide area network and then there's 10 gbas ew which runs over single mode fiber for up to 40 km and again on that Sonet type WAN network then there's 10 gbas lx4 which runs over single mode fiber and it's good for up to 300 M then there is 10gbase lx4 over multim mode which is over multimode fiber which is good for up to 10 kilm and finally there is 10 gbas CX4 this runs over infinity band copper cabling and it's good for up to 15 M it's time to conclude with some other standards first up is Doc ACC are data over cable services interface specification these are the standards that have been established to provide the interface requirements for data Transmissions over a Broadband cable network to achieve the best performance when using Broadband cable the cable modem should meet the highest docis standard used by the cable provider the most current docus standard is 3.1 which allows for up to a theoretical maximum download speed of 10 gbits per second with a theoretical upload speed of 1 gigabits per second then there's the I E1 1905.1 d23 standard this is a standard that defines a network enabler or device that is used to create a convergent home networking environment that includes different types of wired and wireless networks the standard also includes ethernet over power line which is using the existing electrical wiring in a structure as the media to transport data the standard also includes ethernet over HDMI which is using an HDMI interface and cable to transport Network traffic now that concludes this session on the introduction to wired Network standards I began by talking about the Tia eiia 568a and 568b standards then I moved on to the ethernet standards and I concluded with a brief discussion on some other standards on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on security policies and other documents today I'm going to be discussing some security policies and then I will conclude with a brief discussion on other documents there's a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing security policy policies policies are a set of guidelines established by management that are used to set the expected behavior in the workplace procedures are different than policies in that a procedure is a set of steps required to be taken in a given situation policies and procedures work hand inand to create a safe and secure work environment in which employees know the guidelines and what is expected of them policies and procedures should be given to every person on the day they start and periodic training should be conducted to ensure that they remain fresh in everyone's mind one of the security policies to consider is the consent to monitoring this is a policy that establishes an employer's right to monitor the employees actions and Communications this can include monitoring emails if they Traverse company equipment in any way then the emails are not considered private but are actually company assets that they have a right to view and do with as they please these consent to monitoring policies also include the monitoring or recording of phone conversations also monitoring activities on computers hard drives and phones in a highly secure work environment it may also include include the video monitoring and recording of normal work activities another security policy is a clean desk policy this is a policy that is concerned about the handling of sensitive data sensitive data should not be left unattended in a workplace and should be put away when not in use not left on a desktop these policies also include the computer desktop sensitive data should not be left left easily accessible on the PC then there are recording policies this is a policy that restricts the use of cameras tape recorders portable storage devices or any other device that may be used to record or a copy sensitive workplace information then there are equipment access policies there are a security policy that establishes who has access to which equipment and when these could incl include access to server rooms wiring closets Network racks or any other area that is deemed to have a security risk there are security policies that deal with the handling of user or customer information they're used to establish how to secure sensitive employee and customer information User and customer information is a major Target of hackers when they breach Computing systems the loss of control of this data can severely damage a company any policy that is used to help secure the workplace or company data is by default a security policy Approximately 80% of all Network and data breaches occur from within the companies that are attempting to secure the data sometimes they occur by mistake however all too often they are intentional all policies should have an enforcement aspect to them that details what employees should expect to happen if they violate the policy the range of actions can be from retraining to termination and prosecution now let's conclude with a brief discussion on some other documents first up is the AUP or acceptable use policy these are a set of rules and guidelines established by the Creator owner or administrator of information systems that detail what users may or may not do with that information system it is considered to be part of the security policy the AUP should be fairly detailed in what is allowed or not allowed to occur all users should be required to sign the acceptable use policy and these records should should be kept on file then there are network policy documents there are a broad range of policies that establish the guidelines for the network they include policies that control the use and operation of the network as well as policies on how to implement changes to it many security policies fall under the general Network policies category there are some standard business documents that you should be familiar with the first one is the memorandum of understanding or mou it's an agreement between two or more organizations that detail how those organizations are to undertake a common course of action anou is often used before a legally binding agreement has been created sometimes the mou is called a letter of intent or Loi then there is the the statement of work or the S so it's a detailed document that specifies what work is to be performed the expected outcome of the work or the deliverables of the work and the timelines to perform that work the S so plays an important role in project management documentation then there is the master license agreement or the MLA it's a legal agreement between two entities in which one agrees to pay the other for the use of a specific piece of software or a software package for a specific period of time so the person using the software doesn't actually own the software the Creator or the vendor retains the legal rights to that software or that software package and finally there's the service level agreement or the SLA it's an agreement that details the allowable amount of response time the vendor has to resolve an issue or problem the SLA is most commonly associated with a service contract now that concludes this session on security policies and other documents I briefly talked about security policies and then I concluded with a discussion on some other documents on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on introduction to safety practices part one today I'm going to be talking about electrical safety and then I'm going to move on to installation safety I have a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin in this session of course I'm going to begin with electrical safety electrical grounding is used to protect technicians and equipment in the case of electrical insulation failure electrical grounding provides an alternate path for the electricity this is often referred to as a return to Earth all electrical systems should be connected to properly grounded circuits this helps to protect both the technician and the equipment then there's ESD or electrostatic discharge ESD is caused when two electrically charged objects that have different amounts of electrical charge come into contact creating a sudden flow of energy between the objects as they normalize the levels this is a static discharge ESD can damage sensitive components particularly the CPU and or your Random Access memory using an ESD mat helps to reduce the chances of ESD using an ESD strap will further reduce the chances for ESD the strap goes around the wrist of the technician and then is clipped to a ground Source usually to an exposed metal surface inside of a piece of equipment's case you should always practice self grounding self grounding is a normalization technique used to equalize the amount of electrical charge between the worker and the equipment being worked on after the case has been opened and the ESD strap is attached to a ground Source touch an exposed metal surface inside the case before actually touching any of the components this will normalize electrical charge between you and the equipment that you're working on in some cases additional equipment grounding may be necessary in case of an electrical fire unplug the power source or turn off the circuit breaker always use a Class C or multiclass fire extinguisher on electrical fires never use water you run the risk of electrocution and damaging that equipment even more than the fire is already doing so let's talk about fire suppression systems building codes often call for the install a of fire suppression systems and there are several different types of common systems there's the wet pipe the overhead pipes are pressurized and contain water all of the time then there's the dry pipe the pipes are not pressurized the water is contained in a holding tank until a fire breaks out and then it is pumped to the area where it needs to be dispersed there are preaction types of fire suppression systems the they're similar to a dry pipe system but the sprinkler head contains a thermal fusible link that must melt before the water is released then there's the delug fire suppression system these are designed to release a large amount of water in a short amount of time into a predefined space the Deluge system is the least desirable option for electrical components on the other hand a Halon type system is the most desirable type of fire suppression system for electrical components Halon is a nonconducting volatile gaseous chemical it works by chemically disrupting the combustion process Halon does not leave a residue upon evaporation and unlike water Halon will not ruin electrical components it is safe for exposure to humans in limited amounts for a limited amount of time Halon is also environmentally safe it's also known as a clean agent now it's time to move on to installation Safety First up is using proper lifting techniques Bend at the knees not at the waist keep your head up when lifting avoid twisting when carrying items if the item is heavy or awkward request help in lifting it also remember most companies establish weight limitations so if you're going to lift something that is going to exceed that weight limitation ask for help more than likely you are going to need to install equipment racks at some point in time or another racks are used to help create a clean organized environment especially when they're used with proper cable management techniques racks are designed to provide sufficient airf flow for the electrical components that are placed in them when assembling and installing racks always follow the manufacturer's instructions always use the proper tools to prevent damaging the racks or the Fasteners that hold them together many servers and networking components come rack ready that means they're specifically designed to be placed into an equipment rack let's talk about rack placement when designing a room that is going to hold multiple racks of computing systems some thought needs to go into the placement of those racks HVAC and rack placement should be done concurrently heating ventilation and air conditioning systems should be designed to control both heat and humidity levels when multiple racks are going to be installed creating a hot Isle cold aisle design is recommended the hot aisle is the side of the aisle that receives the exhaust air flow from the Computing equipment this aisle should face an HVAC air intake the cold aisle is the side or aisle that the air intakes of the Computing equipment face this aisle should face an HVAC air vent also whenever possible a server room should be designed with a raised floor to help protect against water damage the raised floor like a drop ceiling can also be utilized as part of the cable management system system let's talk about tool safety always use the proper tool for the job that is what it was designed for do not use pencils as a probe it is possible for the pencil to conduct electricity leading to an ESD situation or shock hazard do not use magnetized tools when working on electrical components as the magnetic charge can be harmful to the magnetically kept data and that magnetically charged tool may damage sensitive components when using compressed air to blow out debris maintain a minimum distance of 4 in from the nozzle to the component always use isopropyl alcohol to clean products in place of rubbing alcohol rubbing alcohol contains a higher water content of approximately around 30% whereas the water content and isopropyl alcohol is lower never use a standard vacuum cleaner when vacuuming electrical components is necessary due to the design of the standard vacuum electrostatic discharges are a common occurrence there are specifically designed vacuum cleaners that can be used on electrical components now that concludes this session on the introduction to safety practices part one I talked about electrical safety and then I concluded with installation safety safety on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to safety practices part two today I'm going to talk about the MSDS and then I'm going to conclude with some emergency preparations there's a fair amount of to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the MSDS part of any Safety First approach to a safe work environment includes knowing what hazards are present in the workplace material safety data sheets or msdss contain safety information on materials and chemicals found in the workplace an MSDS will contain all known health issues associated with a particular material it also outlines what protective measures must be taken to reduce risks from exposure and what actions must be taken if the chemical is ingested the MSDS will also detail the physical properties of the material as in its flash point or boiling point and the MSDS will outline the proper steps to take when disposing of it each workplace will have its own set of msdss as each workplace is different it is your responsibility to understand the hazards that are present so you need to know where the msdss are kept for your workplace it's time to move on to some emergency preparations part of any Safety First approach to a safe work environment includes preparing for various types of emergencies these preparations should be detailed in a set of emergency procedure documents the procedures should contain Escape Routes including where employees will meet to ensure that all are accounted for information on what type or types of fire suppression systems are present as well as what steps have been taken to increase the daytoday safety in the workplace there are some building layout consideration ations that concern emergency preparations all walls should have a minimum 2hour fire rating this is the amount of time it takes for the average fire to burn through the wall exterior doors and other secure doors must be designed to resist forcible entry but the doorways should also be designed to be able to handle the amount of expected traffic in an emergency fire suppression systems should be appropriate for the type of asset that they are protecting a wet pipe system is not appropriate for a server room or data center however a Halon system may not be the correct fire suppression system for an open cubical area backup power should also be incorporated into the building layout not all areas are going to require backup power but for some areas it is going to be essential emergency preparations need to include escape plans each area or room should have an Escape Plan map posted in a prominent area ideally by the main access doorway into that area this map needs to show the preferred route out of the facility the map should also include the meeting area outside of the danger zone this allows for supervisors or managers to account for all personnel safety or emergency exits should be clearly marked they should also be well lit with independent battery power sources they should be wide enough to handle the expected traffic and emergency exits should always be kept clear of obstructions talking about doors there are some other considerations are they going to be fail open or fail closed so what happens to doors with electronic locks when the power is out needs to be considered they could be fail closed type doors with this type of door when the power is cut the locks engage these are suitable for keeping secure areas secure in an emergency then there are fail open type electronic locks when the power is cut the locks disengage these are suitable for nonsecure areas or for areas where twoway traffic is going to occur in an emergency in many facilities fail close closed type fire doors are used usually they're kept open by electromagnetics once the fire alarm has been tripped the power is cut to the magnets and the doors swing Clos they usually do not lock when closed but are used to help slow the spread of fire or other dangers another emergency preparation that should be considered are emergency alert systems all facilities should have an emergency alert system installed it is usually required by local building codes these are your fire alarms and whatnot combinations of sound and Light have proven to be highly effective in some situations it may be advisable to connect the facility to the National emergency alert system now that concludes this session on introduction to safety practices part two I began with the MSDS and then I concluded with emergency preparations on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on rack and power management today I'm going to talk about rack management and then I'm going to conclude with a brief segment on power management with with that let's go ahead and begin today's session I'm going to begin by talking about rack management rack systems are specially designed racks used to hold networking and Computing equipment sometimes they are referred to as server racks these rack systems follow one of several different designs however they all follow the same height specification that specification is the standard unit and it's designated by the capital letter U now the standard unit involves the amount of vertical space that can be used to hold equipment a standard unit is equal to 1.75 in so a 15 U rack has 26 and 1/4 in of vertical storage space most rack servers and Enterprise level networking equipment are designed to fit within r rack systems there are several different types of racks racks are normally either two poost or four poost racks they may be freestanding or they may be floor mounted server rail racks have slide mounts to make it easy to pull out servers to perform necessary maintenance now let's talk about device placement devices that generate the most amount of heat or are not heat sensitive should be be placed towards the top of the rack devices that generate the least amount of heat or are heat sensitive should be placed toward the bottom of the rack all equipment cold air intakes should face the same direction all equipment exhaust Outlets should therefore also face the same direction when mounting equipment in racks vertical space should be left between the equipment to promote adequate air flow when when multiple rows of racks are implemented a hot Isle cold Isis approach should be used to promote proper air flow and cooling racks should be monitored for environmental factors to help ensure the health of the servers and other equipment monitor should be in place for temperature humidity vibration water leaks smoke and intrusion and that brings us to Rack security most rack systems do not come with rack Security in mind but it can be easily added after rack installation rack doors can be added that have either keyed or electronic locks if the equipment is not secured it can be easily stolen now let's have a brief discussion on power management so before I begin talking about power management let me give you a little bit of trivia we're all familiar with the power symbol that you see there to the right that's actually a binary symbol what that is is a zero with a one poking through it I knowe not very relevant to today's discussion but it's an interesting bit of trivia Now power is often overlooked when designing a network however without power management the network may never work properly most people assume that when they plug a piece of equipment into a wall socket that that piece of equipment is going to power up just fine in most cases they are correct however if the circuit cannot provide enough amps to the equipment damage may occur it is important to know the power requirements and loads for all of the equipment that will be in place this helps to ensure that the proper electrical circuits are installed so that sufficient power is delivered where it is needed when it is needed power converters convert electrical energy from one form to another as in from AC to DC or from one voltage level to another on the other hand power inverters are a type of power converter that specifically converts voltages from DC to AC then we have the uninterruptable power supply the UPS it uses power converters to rece receive electrical current from an AC electrical source and it passes that current to a battery or set of batteries for storage it then uses a power inverter to receive DC current from the batteries and pass it to another device as a conditioned and well regulated AC flow they're used to provide a steady stream of conditioned electrical power to components they help to protect sens of electrical components from Power anomalies either from Power spikes power outs or from Power sags in some cases you may want to consider installing power redundancies critical components should include redundant power supplies that means that if one power supply fails the other one takes over immediately without any loss of service now that concludes this session on rack and Power Man management I began by talking briefly about rack management and then I concluded with a brief discussion on power management on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian F and welcome to pait's session on cable management today I'm going to be talking about cable distribution and then I will conclude with some cable management components we have a fair amount of ground to cover with not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about cable distribution and the first item under cable distribution is the main distribution frame or MDF this is the location where the dmark DeMark extension Main switch or router in patch panel are placed the MDF is where outside traffic ERS a location and is then distributed to the internal Network it is possible to also have an intermediate distribution frame or IDF it's a location solution for when a single MDF is not sufficient they usually occur in multistory buildings the idfs are connected to the MDF by vertical crossconnect cables or VCC cables it is common for an MDF to contain separate IDF panels for each floor of a building a vertical cross connect is the main patch panel for a location it usually resides in the same location or very close to the Demar and Main switch or router I mentioned patch panels earlier so let's talk about those they're used to terminate network cable runs usually within a building as in from the wall jacks to a central location the network runs are called horizontal cabling patch panels are used to organize and administer the physical aspects of the network cables network runs are punched down to the back of the patch panel which normally contains either a 66 or 110 block with an Associated port on the front of the patch panel patch cables are used to connect the patch panel ports to networking gear quite often a switch workstations connect to the patch panel using horizontal cabling this location is called the horizontal cross connect or HCC and is usually located in the IDF switches may or may not be present in this location if a workstation needs to be relocated to a different switch or Port all that needs to be done is to make the change in the location of the patch panel so you unplug the cable from one port and you plug it into a new port with that covered let's talk about Cable Management components labeling is an important part of cable management it can cause stress when working with networks but it doesn't have to the key to proper labeling is to create a naming convention which is a systematic and consistent method that makes sense for the situation proper labeling will ease the management of the physical aspects of the network especially when dealing with cables labels should be placed on everything that deals with the network beginning from the wall jacks all the way through to the patch panel switches and routers the naming convention should be documented and kept with the network diagrams let me give you an example of a naming convention suppose office 219 has Network outlets on all four walls the Jacks could be labeled 219 n 219 W Etc and that would be for 219 North or 219 West Etc the horizontal cabling from 219 feeds into a patch panel in an IDF located on the second floor that contains two 48 Port switches that tie in all the horizontal cross connects the cable coming in from Office 219 to the patch panel could be labeled 219 W or 219s etc etc as it relates to their location in the office the switches could be labeled s SW 2A and S SW 2B now suppose that the patch cables for office 219 connect to switch 2bs ports 20 through 24 the patch cables could be labeled 219 n s sw2 B21 or 219 e s sw2 b22 etc etc the key is to be consistent and to document everything and finally there are cable trays masses of cables can block air flow and act as an insulator that allows for excessive heat to build up cable trays are used to organize cabling and to keep it away from areas where cabling may cause heat to build up cable trays keep bundles of cables neat and fairly well organized that concludes this session on cable management I talked about cable distribution and then I briefly covered some cable management components on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pacit session on the basics of change management today we're going to be talking about the reasons for change management and then we're going to conclude with some different change management processes I have a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the reason for change management in a fairly simple Network it is fairly easy to evaluate not only the necessity for a change but also the possible impacts of that change however as the network system increases in size and complexity it becomes more difficult to not only determine what changes are necessary but also the possible impacts that the proposed changes will have on the system as a whole it is quite possible even highly probable that a single change will have a ripple effect on the whole system change management processes are used to introduce changes to a system in a controlled manner to minimize possible disruption and potential pandemonium with the reason for change management covered let's move on to different change management processes first up is document the reason for a change proposed changes should have a solid reason for occurring a best practice is to include why the change is needed for it reasons and also for business reasons as the change proceeds through the process more documentation may be added to the reason for a change so let's talk about the change request a formal change request procedure is used during the approval process and should include several other subdocuments that can be used to gain approval one of those documents is the configuration procedures documents these document the exact steps required to implement the change including affected devices applications and processes the change request should also include a roll back process as all change carries risk a plan to reverse changes is required in order to gain approval then there are potential impact documents the potential impact documents are a good faith effort to identify all possible impacts to the overall system both the positive and the negative then there is the notification procedures after the potential impacts have been identified the people responsible for the affected systems must receive notification of the proposed change keeping your stakeholders informed and involved will greatly increase the chances of a successful change let's talk about approval processes proposed changes should be vetted and approved not only by management but also by senior IT personnel Security Experts and by a selection of those affected by the change some companies create Change Control boards to not only evaluate proposed changes but to also Implement a means of approving changes these boards also assure that all approved changes have been fully tested and documented the change boards meet periodically to assess the status of an approved change this helps to keep it on track for implementation change boards maintain responsibility for the change and verify that the process is proceeding according to the configuration procedure and finally change boards help to ensure that approved changes are are implemented correctly when planning out a change to an IT system it's important to involve a maintenance window procedure a maintenance window is the amount of time that a system will be down or unavailable during the proposed change before the final schedule is developed an evaluation of all affected systems must be performed with particular attention paid to Mission critical systems it is possible that the proposed maintenance window May exceed the allowable downtime for critical systems which will affect when the maintenance window can be scheduled a subprocedure to the maintenance window procedure is authorized downtime once a maintenance window has been identified it is then possible to determine the optimum time to implement the change in many cases system changes need to occur during off hours as in after the close of business or during weekends when systems are not not utilized as much then there's the notification of change procedure after a sufficient time has elapsed in which to evaluate any issues all stakeholders those are the people who approved the change and all others affected by the change should be notified of the successful completion of the change this allows the stakeholders to further monitor the systems for any unforeseen or residual issues relating to the change and finally there's final documentation the change process should end with an update to the appropriate documentation including Network configurations additions to the network and physical location changes a closing Change Report should also be created that summarizes the change to help refine the change procedures and processes even further this closing report should include what went right and what went wrong during the the approved change that concludes this session on the basics of change management I talked about the reasons for change management and then I concluded with different change management processes on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common networking protocols part one today I'm going to briefly discuss TCP and UDP and then I'm going to briefly run through some common ports and protocols with that let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin with a brief overview of TCP and UDP both transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol are both transport layer or layer 4 protocols the they're both responsible for the delivery of network data between nodes while they are both layer 4 protocols they do have some differences TCP uses a reliable delivery method this ensures that all the packets that are sent are received it uses acknowledgements as a means of error correction TCP also establishes flow control to reduce the error rate and ensure proper delivery on the other hand UDP uses a best effort delivery method it sends data but doesn't care if the packets are all received there is no error correction and with UDP speed and low Network overhead are the major concerns not the reliable delivery of the information now let's discuss some common ports and protocols first up is HTTP that's hypertext trans transfer protocol it's the primary protocol used to transfer data over the Internet it is assigned to Port 80 then there's https which is hyper text transfer protocol secure it is the primary protocol to securely transfer data over the internet using SSL or TLS technology that's secure socket layer or transport layer security technology in actuality as SSL should no longer be used you should only be using TLS by default https is assigned to Port 443 then there's net bios that's Network basic input output system this was originally developed to allow hosts to be able to communicate with servers by default it's assigned to Ports 137 through 139 then we have SMTP or simp simple mail transfer protocol this is the protocol that's used to transfer email from a client to an email server or to transfer email between different email servers by default it's assigned to Port 25 post office protocol version 3 or pop 3 is the protocol used by clients to retrieve email from servers once engaged POP 3 downloads all the messages from the servers the user cannot access email messages until they have been downloaded by the pop 3 protocol POP 3 is assigned to Port 1110 in contrast to pop 3 is IMAP that's internet message access protocol it's a protocol used by clients to access email on email servers allows the client to administer and organize email on the server into folders without having to download it first by default IMAP is assigned to Port 143 next up is sip or session initiation protocol it's a protocol that is most commonly used to set up and tear down multimedia communication sessions as in voice over IP in a voice over IP session sip is used to establish and determinate the session session initiation protocol is commonly assigned to either port 560 or to Port 561 often used in conjunction with session initiation protocol is RTP that's realtime transport protocol this is the protocol that is commonly used to format and deliver multimedia or streaming content as an example RTP handles the flow of packets in a voice over IP session after session initiation protocol has established the connection RTP is commonly assigned to Ports 504 and to Port 505 then there's media Gateway control protocol or mgcp it's a protocol that defines a means of communication between a packet switched Network and a circuit switched Network as in the pstn it can be used to set up and maintain and terminate calls between multiple endpoints as and teleconferencing it's commonly assigned to Ports 2427 and or to Port 2727 last up we have h323 this is a protocol that provides a standard for delivering video over IP networks it defines how realtime audio video and data are to be transmitted it provides signaling and bandwidth control it's commonly assigned to Port 1720 that concludes this session on common networking protocols part one I did a brief summary of TCP and UDP and then I briefly ran through some common ports and protocols on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell welcome to pait's session on common networking protocols part two today I'm going to be talking about the difference between ports and protocols and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on some common ports and protocols with that let's go ahead and jump into this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about the difference between ports and protocols ports are a method of specifying what protocol our service to access many protocols and services use default ports so they are easy to locate there are 65,536 ports available to be used for communication but Port zero is reserved the first 10,24 ports are specifically assigned and are called welln ports if you would like to learn more about those you can check out the.org or website ports can be thought of as a phone number extension the IP address is the main number you are trying to reach the port is the extension for the service or protocol that you want to access protocols can be thought of as the language that two applications on either side of the connection agree to speak protocols translate requests into Services most protocols use predefined port but some protocols must be user configured for the ports that they use something to remember ports are not protocols and Protocols are not ports even though the two are closely associated they are not the same ports are used to request or access services or applications Protocols are the services or applications that are being requested when a requestor seeks to connect to a specific specific Port the requestor is dynamically assigned a port number to listen to for the response this also allows computers to have many concurrent connections at the same time it's time to move on to a brief discussion on common ports and protocols first up is the file transfer protocol or FTP it's a standard protocol for transferring files between Computing systems and it it does require user authentication FTP uses ports 20 and 21 although nowadays it mostly just uses Port 20 then there's tftp or trivial file transfer protocol this is used to transfer files between servers and clients but no user authentication is required by default tftp is assigned to Port 69 then there's s nmp or simple Network management protocol it's a protocol used to Monitor and manage local area networks by default it is assigned to Port 161 then we have tnet which is a protocol that is used for remote access to systems it is unsecure but it is also a bidirectional terminal service that comes in handy on occasion by default telnet uses Port 23 more secure than tnet is SSH or secure shell it's a protocol that's used to encrypt data traffic on networks it can be used in place of telet to provide a secure bidirectional terminal Connection by default SSH uses Port 22 a very useful protocol to have is DNS or the domain name system protocol this is the protocol that's used to map computer names to their IPs addresses DNS is assigned to Port 53 by default then there's DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol this is the protocol used within networks to automatically configure computers with the correct IP configuration there are two ports used with DHCP requests are assigned to Port 67 responses from the DHCP server are ass assigned to Port 68 remote desktop protocol or RDP is used in Microsoft networks by both the remote desktop connection and remote assistance applications to make remote connections RDP is assigned to Port 3389 last up we have SMB or server message Block it's a protocol used to transfer files over a network the process is transparent to the user the user never sees SMB SMB can be configured to run over net bios on ports 137 through Port 139 but by default SMB is assigned to Port 400 and 45 that concludes this session on common networking protocols part two today I talked about the differences between ports and protocols and then I briefly discussed some common ports and protocols on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon
