today we're going to talk about the limit of a function when we have a limit of a function we write the following the limit as x approaches some value a of f of x equals l in words this becomes the following the limit of f of x as x approaches a is l we could also write this as f of x approaches l as your x value approaches a so let's do an example let's compute the limit as x approaches one of our function we'll call this function x minus one over x squared minus one well what we can do is we can pick some values of x and plug it into our function and see what happens as x gets closer to one so let's create a table we'll have a column for our x value and a column for our f of x so if x were 0.5 our f of x would be 0.667 and actually going on forever if x were 0.9 our f of x is 0.526 if x were 0.99 our f of x is 0.5025 if x is 0.999 our f of x is 0.50025 and if our x was 0.9999 our f of x is going to be 0.500 zero two five so you might notice a pattern as our x value is going towards one our f of x value is going towards another number and we'll just confirm this and we'll check out when x is a little bit greater than one so let's start from the other way for our x value is 1.5 what's the f of x value well that case it's 0.4 when x is 1.1 we have it's 0.476 when it's 1.01 it's zero point four 9 7 5 when it's 1.001 it's 0.49975 and as you see it is getting closer to 1. so therefore we can conclude that as our x value gets closer and closer to 1 the limit as x goes to 1 of x minus 1 over x squared minus 1 is equal to excuse me not 1 it's equal to 0.5 and if we were to actually graph this function y equals x minus one over x squared minus one what we get is the following graph it looks something like this where we have a hole right here when x is one but the value of that hole is at 0.5 so even though there's a hole so the function does not exist at that point it's still the limit that function goes all the way towards it everything points towards it it just doesn't include that point so limit is just saying where do all the indications say the function is going towards so if we're to look at a graph you might say that if we have some graph that looks like this if right here that's our a of our function f of x the limit as the function approaches or as x approaches a so we just look and we see as x gets closer to a what is the value of the function and that limit is whatever this point is but sometimes we're concerned only about what happens as we approach a from a certain side from either the left side or from the right side when we want to write the limit as x approaches a from just one side we write it as the following the limit of f of x as x approaches a and if we're going from the left side we write a negative sign then we say this equals l in words we write the limit as of f x as x approaches a from the right or excuse me from the left is l now similarly you could write the right hand limit and the right hand limit would just be written instead of the limit of f of x as x approaches a from the right side we just use a plus instead of a minus but it means the limit of f of x as x approaches a from the right side is l so we have the limit we have the limit where it approaches from the left side and the limit where it approaches from the right side and so now we put all this together all the different limits we've learned and we have the following we have given the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l we have this is true if and only if we have the other fault the following the limit as x approaches a from the left hand side of f of x equals l and the limit as x approaches a from the right hand side of f of x equals l so what we have is we have just the limit of f of x as x approaches a equals some value l that is true only if we have both the left hand limit and the right hand limit equaling the same thing all right let's do an example say we have some function that looks like this and it some does something like that and then we have another gap right here but it goes right there so let's put this at 1 2 3 and let's have 1 2 and negative 1 negative 2. so this is our function f of x let's determine what the limit of f of x is when x approaches 1 from the left side the limit of f of x as x approaches one from the right side and let's give myself a little bit more room and the limit of f of x as x approaches just one what what is this well if we look at this and as x approaches one from the left side this is the value one what does the function look like as we approach one well if we're approaching one from the left side it goes right here to the value of two so we have our answer for this first one is two what about as it approaches one from the right side well from the right side we're over here so we're approaching one from the right and it goes down to negative 2. so now we said what's the limit as x approaches 1 well the limit only equals a number if and only if these two limits are equal but these two limits are different since they're different we can say that the limit does not exist now let's compute the limit as x approaches 3. so we'll do three things we'll find the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 from the left side the limit of f of x as x approaches three from the right side and the limit of f of x as x approaches three well as x approaches three from the left side we're going and we come right here so that would be two as x approaches three from the right side we're coming up down here and we hit and that would also be excuse me not two uh one maybe one and it's also 1 right here and finally since we have the left and right hand limits are both equal to 1 the limit as x approaches 3 is just 1. but note what is f of three the value at three is actually zero so the actual value of f of three equals zero doesn't necessarily have to equal the limit now sometimes the limit of a function doesn't equal an actual value example of that might look like if our function does something like this goes all the way up to infinity and from the right side it also goes all the way up to infinity so if it goes up to infinity we have the following we write it as the limit as x approaches some value a of f of x is equal to infinity similarly it might go down to negative infinity and we would write the limit as x approaches a of f of x is negative infinity so we might even have something like this we might have a graph that does this and it goes all the way up to infinity and it doesn't actually quite touch this line it just goes arbitrarily close and gets very large so this was the limit as x approaches some value a from the left side of the function f of x and that's going to be infinity so this right here is the point a and this is our function f of x we might also have say go down to negative infinity in which case it might look like this so that's our point a and this is f of x and so this is the limit as x goes to a oops i've been writing the wrong sign f of a goes to a from the left side of f of x equals in this case negative infinity now you may recall that these points from algebra these values are actually what we call vertical asymptotes of functions so we have a definition that says the vertical line x equals a is what we call a vertical asymptote of the line y equals f of x if at least one of the following is true and what we'll have is we have the limit as x approaches a from the left side of f of x is infinity the limit as x approaches a from the right side of f x is infinity or the limit as x approaches a of f of x is infinity or the limit as x approaches a from the right side of f of x is negative infinity or the limit as x approaches a from the left side of f of x is negative infinity or the limit as x approaches a of f of x is negative infinity so if any of these cases happen then we have what we call a vertical asymptote now that we know what limits are we're going to calculate limits and we're going to use the limit laws to do this so first we're going to suppose that c is constant and we'll also suppose that the limits exist for exists for the falling the limit as x approaches a of f of x and the limit as x approaches a of g of x so if these two limits exist then we're going to have the following we have first one the limit as x approaches a of the quantity f of x plus g of x is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x plus the limit as x approaches a of g of x so this is the sum law where we take the limit of the sum of two functions is the sum of each of their limits similarly we have the difference law which says that if we're taking the limit as x approaches a of the quantity f of x minus g of x that's equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus the limit as x approaches a of g of x the next thing three we have if we're dealing with a constant multiple so the limit as x approaches a of some constant c times our function f of x this is just equal to the constant times the limit as x approaches a of f of x so if we have some constant all we need to do is just multi multiply that constant by the limit of the function now we have two more so number four this is going to be the product so if we have the limit as x approaches a of the product of two functions f of x times g of x this is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x times the limit as x approaches a of g of x and finally we have the fifth law that we're going to go over right now and this is going to be the quotient law and this says that the limit as x approaches a of the quantity f of x over g of x is equal to the limit as x approaches e of f of x divided by the limit as x approaches a of g of x but this is provided that the limit as x approaches a of g of x is not equal to zero because then we'd be dividing by zero so this is if the limit as x approaches a of g of x is not oops zero so for example if i told you that the limit as x approaches three of f of x is two and the limit as x approaches three of g of x is negative four then if we were to calculate the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x plus 2 g of x we can use the law of limits so what we have here first of all is addition so we could separate this into the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x plus the limit as x approaches 3 of 2 g of x but notice right here 2 is a constant and so by using the constant we can pull the constant in front and so this we get is the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x plus 2 times the limit as x approaches 3 of g of x and we know that the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x is going to be 2 from right up here and the limit as x approaches let me just make a little bit smaller so we have this first limit is 2 plus 2 times negative 4. so we have this is equal to negative six so there are a couple more limit laws that we have so number six this is the limit as x approaches a of the quantity f of x raised to the power n is going to be the same as the limit as x approaches a of f of x all raised to the power n this is the case where n is some positive integer we also have the limit as x approaches a of just some constant c well that's just going to be c because it's constant it never changes it's always going to be c number eight we have the limit as x approaches a of x is equal to well this is pretty intuitive as well well if x approaches a then the limit of x should just be a since x is going towards a we also have for 9 the limit as x approaches a of x to the power n is equal to a to the power n and this is just for some positive integer n number ten we have the limit as x approaches a of the nth root of a assuming the nth root of x this should equal the nth root of a where again a our n is a positive integer and we're going to assume that a is also positive and next we have number 11 and this law says that the limit as x approaches a of the nth root of f of x is equal to the nth root of the limit as x approaches a of f of x okay and again if n is even we're going to assume that what's in the radical is positive so let's do an example let's calculate the limit as x goes to 5 of 2x squared minus 3x plus 4. well we have three things going on we're adding and subtracting so we can separate this into three limits the limit as x goes to 5 two x squared minus the limit as x goes to five of three x plus the limit as x goes to five of four now for this first one right here we have we're multiplying by constant so we can pull that out this becomes two times the limit as x goes to five of x squared minus we also have a constant 3 so we can pull that out 3 times the limit as x goes to 5 of x plus and the limit of a constant 4 is a constant so this is just going to be 4. we already found that part now what we have the x squared that can be rewritten as the following so this is going to be two times the limit as x goes to five of x quantity squared minus three and then now the limit as x goes to 5 of x is just going to be 5. and then we have plus 4. and so the limit right here inside is going to be 5. so we write that now as 2 times 5 squared minus fifteen plus four and we get this is equal to thirty nine now we have a property and this says that if f is a polynomial or a rational function and the value a is in the domain of f then we have the following then the limit as x goes to a of f of x is just simply f of a now this relates to something we call continuous at the point a but we'll talk about that later many times we can use this direct substitution it will make life easy but sometimes we cannot so for example if we're trying to find the limit as x approaches 1 of x squared minus 1 over x minus 1 what can we do if we plugged 1 right into this we would get 1 squared minus 1 over 1 minus 1 and so we'd be dividing by zero and we cannot do that so we know that one is not in the domain but if we were to simplify this we simplify the expression and we rewrote it as x squared minus one instead we wrote it as x minus one times x plus one when we divide it by x minus one and we divided by x minus one we see that we cancel and this is just x plus one so if we were to then plug that in what we get is the following we get the limit as x goes to 1 of x plus 1 and this is a polynomial so we can straight uh substitute and so this becomes 1 plus 1 which is 2. we also have another property and this says that if f of x equals g of x when x is not equal to a then regardless if if it's not equal to a we know that the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals the limit as x goes to a of g of x provided that limit exists so an example of what this might look like is if we have say two functions and one function looks like this this is our f of x and then we have a second function that looks like this so this is our point a and our g of x and these two functions are the same everywhere except at the point a at the point a g of x has a value up here but doesn't really matter because their limits are both going to point down here now we have a theorem and this theorem states that the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l if and only if the limit as x approaches a from the left side of f of x equals l and that equals the limit as x approaches a from the right side of f of x we have another theorem that states the following that if f of x is less than or equal to g of x when x is near a and this except for when possibly it's equal to a and the limits of f and g both exist as x approaches a then we have the following the limit as x approaches a of f of x is less than or equal to the limit as x approaches a of g of x and this should be sort of intuitive if one function is less than the other then the limit of that function is less than or equal to the limit of the of that one and the last theorem we're going to talk about is one that actually has a name and this is called the squeeze theorem and this says given three functions and if the function's f of x is less than or equal to g of x is less than or equal to h of x when x is near a except possibly possibly at a and if we have that the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals the limit as x approaches a of h of x equals some value l then the limit as x approaches a of g of x is l so what this is saying is that if we have three functions f g and h where f is less than g is less than h and if the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals h of x then that means that we're squeezing g of x the limit to be the same value so let's do an example let's try and and show that the limit as x approaches 0 of x squared times sine of 1 over x is equal to 0. well we cannot reuse the following we cannot write it as the limit as x goes to 0 of x squared times the limit as x goes to zero of sine of one over x because this does not exist so what we'll do is we now look at x squared times sine of one over x now we know that sine of one over x sine of anything really will vary between negative one and one and so therefore we can bound this by just saying that negative x squared is less than or equal to x squared times sine of one over x is less than or equal to positive x squared because we know that sine of 1 over x varies between negative 1 that's where we get this and positive 1. and so now applying the squeeze theorem what we get is we're going to find the limit as x goes to 0 of negative x squared well that right there as it goes to zero is just simply zero and the limit as x goes to zero of positive x squared is also zero and so therefore we know by the squeeze theorem that if we have something like this where it's all between then we can conclude that the limit as x goes to zero of x squared sine one over x is in fact zero today we're going to talk about the precise definition of a limit and so we begin by saying let f be a function defined on some open interval that contains the number a except possibly at a itself then we say that the i'm going to change my font right here that the limit of f of x as x approaches a is l and we write the following we write the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l so we have this if let me move this up a little bit we have this if the following if for every number let's call this number epsilon so for every number epsilon that's greater than zero there is or there exists a number delta greater than zero such that we have the following such that if zero is less than the absolute value of x minus a is less than delta then the absolute value of f of x minus l is less than not delta but epsilon so it's less than epsilon so what we have is that if we have the distance between x and a if that is less than delta then we have that the distance between f and l is less than epsilon graphically what this looks like would be the following so if we have our graph we have x and y then we have some function like this this would be our f of x and if we had some some arbitrary x point excuse me i meant a so if we have some arbitrary value a and it goes right here and if that's what the limit would be and that limit is l then what this says is that if we're given some epsilon so let's just say epsilon looks something like this this has a length of epsilon and then we also have another length epsilon going down so this upper bound right here goes from the point l and we add epsilon so this is really l plus epsilon and then this lower point right here is l minus epsilon so we have a region we start at l and we basically say if we go just a little bit up or a little bit below that's what epsilon says so if there's an epsilon like that what we can say is that there's going to exist some sort of delta such that the difference between your a value and your delta value or excuse me and your x your actual x value will be within that delta so go ahead and extend this line from here we extend it right there we'll bring that down over here again up here we'll extend and then we'll bring that down so as long as we're within this region for our x value then this satisfies so what do i mean first of all i'll go ahead and label the delta we have delta here and here and then this point right here is going to be a plus delta and then over here would be a minus delta so looking at this definition and this says that as long as our x value is the difference between our x value and a is less than delta so we're somewhere in this region so if our x value is close enough over here then our y value will fall within this region and that's what it means for something to be continuous if your x value is close enough then your y value is going to be close enough and that will happen as we get arbitrarily small so let's do an example let's find a number delta such that if 0 is less than x minus 3 is less than delta then we'll have that the absolute value of f of x minus 2 is less than 0.5 so we need to find what delta is so let's go ahead and graph this and i'm giving you the graph so the graph will look something like this and so we have the point uh where an x is three that would be over here and the y value for that would be two so i'm getting all this by looking right over here three and two and then our epsilon how far we're varying in the y direction is 0.5 and so we would have at 2.5 up there and 1.5 down here and if i were to follow that over here and then all the way down what i would get down here is the value 2.6 and then follow this all the way to here and down i get the value 3.8 so notice that these are different lengths the length between here and here and the length between here and here so the length between 2.6 and 3 is 0.4 and the length between 3 and 3.8 is 0.8 so what would our delta be what we need to do is find a delta that guarantees if we're within that width so if we're in some region then the y values will also be in that region so what we want to do is we want to pick the smallest region and that's what our delta would be so we would say delta is equal to 0.4 in this section we're going to talk about continuity so we'll begin with definition definition a function f is what we say continuous at a number a if the following the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals f of a so it's continuous if the limit is equal the limit as x goes cos a is equal to f at that point a notice that we're assuming three things first of all that f of a is in fact defined meaning it's in the in the domain second that the limit as x goes to a of f of x exists and finally we're assuming that the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal to f of a we also have as another definition if f is defined near a we say f is discontinuous at the point a if f is not continuous at a meaning right here that the limit as x goes to a of f of x does not in fact equal f of a so if we have a graph that looks something like this this is continuous at all these points except right here at this value it's not continuous so it's discontinuous right here we might even have a function say f of x is equal to x squared minus x minus 2 divided by x minus two well if we're if x is equal to two we'd have a zero in the denominator and that's not possible so x cannot equal two therefore it's discontinuous at that point x equals 2. now we have another definition and this definition says that a function f is continuous from the right of a number a if we have the following the limit as x approaches a from the right side of f of x is equal to f of a and f is what we say with the next definition f is continuous from the left of a number e if we have that the limit as x approaches a from the left side of f of x is equal to f of a so graphically what this might look like is if we have a graph like this and we have something like that and that's our point a this is our function f of x well if we look at f of x from the right side it is equal to f of x is equal to the right hand limit and so therefore this graph would be continuous from the right at some number at this number a similarly if we had a graph that looked like uh something to this effect go up there and then below we do that then this would be continuous from the left of some number a we have another definition and this states that a function f is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval now we have a theorem this theorem states that if f and g are continuous at the point a and if the value c is a constant then the following functions are also continuous at a one f plus g will also be continuous two f minus g be continuous three the constant c times f is continuous four we have the product f times g and five we have the quotient f divided by g is also continuous and this is if we assume that the denominator g evaluated at the point a is not zero now we have another theorem this theorem states two things a any polynomial is continuous everywhere that is is continuous from negative infinity to infinity on the interval second part of the theorem states that any rational function is continuous wherever it is defined that is it is continuous on its domain so let's take a look at an example find the limit as x approaches negative 2 of the quantity x cubed plus 2x squared minus 1 all over 5 minus 3x well this is a rational function and take a look at this rational function what's its domain well the domain of this is all real numbers except when the denominator is zero so except when x equals five thirds and if we look here we found this limit when x goes to negative 2 well negative 2 is in the domain so now what we can do with this limit is that if we define the function f of x to be this whole x cubed plus two x squared minus one divided by five minus three x and if we're trying to calculate the limit as x goes to negative two of x cubed plus two x squared minus one over five minus three x this is just the same as the limit as x goes to negative 2 of f of x but we know that negative 2 is not or is in the domain excuse me negative 2 is in the domain of this function f of x because the only thing that's not in the domain is 5 3. so therefore we can write it as just simply f of negative two and what is f of negative two well we plug that in and that would be negative two quantity cubed plus two times negative two squared minus one all over five minus three times negative two and simplifying this what we get is negative one over eleven next have a theorem that states the following the following types of functions are continuous at every number in their domains so first we have polynomials second we have root functions and this includes square roots cube roots and so forth we also have rational functions and trigonometric functions so for example on what interval would the function f of x equals negative three x to the four plus five x squared minus eighteen when would this be continuous well this is a polynomial and so because it's a polynomial it's defined everywhere and so it's continuous everywhere by this previous theorem so it is continuous on the interval so continuous on the interval negative infinity to positive infinity what about we do another example and let's call this g of x and um let's do a rational function so let's do uh 3 x squared minus seven x plus eleven divided by x squared minus nine well we want it to be uh it'll be continuous anywhere in its domain so what's the domain of this well since we're dividing by something we can't have the denominator equal zero and so the domain is all numbers in except when x is 3 or negative 3 so all values x such that x cannot equal plus or minus three and therefore it would be continuous for every number except for positive or negative three so we would write that as negative infinity to negative 3 negative 3 to 3 and then 3 all the way on to infinity all this includes all numbers except for three and negative three and finally we'll do one more example and so here we have uh let's see we did uh f g we'll call this function h of x and so h of x is the square root of x plus x plus one over x minus 1 minus x plus 1 over x squared plus 1. well what is the domain for this function what we see here is we have we can break this down into three smaller functions by our previous theorem if we define let's say capital f of x to be square root of x capital g of x to be x plus 1 over x minus 1 capital h of x is x plus 1 divided by x squared plus 1 then we just need to figure out what are the domains for each of these well the domain for f of x capital f of x is all real numbers greater than or equal to zero we cannot have a negative in the square root so this is zero to infinity the domain for the second one it's all real numbers except for negative one so really this is negative infinity or excuse me or positive one so negative infinity to one union one to infinity and this last one it includes well we would never be dividing by zero so our domain is all real numbers negative infinity to infinity so we have these three combining them what we end up with is we have to make sure that it's not negative so we've got to include this but we also know that it cannot include the point one so we get for our our domain and therefore the interval where it's continuous from zero to one but not including one and then one on to infinity and that would be our answer we got another theorem and this theorem states that if f is continuous at the point b and the limit as x approaches a of g of x equals b then we have the limit as x approaches a of f of g of x now this is the composition of functions is equal to f of b so what does this mean well in other words we get that the limit as x approaches a of f of g of x this is equal to f of the limit as x approaches a of g of x we have another theorem and this theorem states that if g is continuous at the point a and our function f is also continuous at the point g of a then composite function given by f of g of x equals f of g of x this is continuous at a and finally we have one last theorem left to go so this theorem is a big theorem and it has a name this is called the intermediate value theorem and what this intermediate value theorem says is suppose f is continuous on the closed interval a to b and let capital n be any number between f of a and f b where f of a does not equal f of b then there exists a number c in the interval a to b such that f c equals n so i'm going to actually draw this out for you so that it might be a little bit more clear so we're going to have axis so we have x we have y we have our function f of x so if we have a point a right here and then over here we have the point b so we bring this up we get f of a we have f of b right here and then we're assuming that n capital n is between f of a and f of b so let's call f n right there what this says is that there exists some point c where c falls somewhere between a and b such that f at that value is equal to c well looking right here right there that's one possible value for c and we'll call that c1 because we have another point that could have been c or even another point that could have been c but as long as there's one the intermediate value theorem is used often when you're trying to find the root or show at least that a root of an equation exists so if we have some function f of x is equal to four x cubed minus six x squared plus three x minus two equals zero and i ask you to show that there exists a root or in other words a zero between one and two what we would first do is calculate what is f of one well f of one plugging this in we get four times one cubed minus six times one squared plus three times one minus two so four times one cubed minus six times one squared plus three times one minus two that's a minus and we end up with this is negative one and we all know negative one to be less than zero f of 2 well this is 4 times 2 cubed minus 6 times 2 squared plus 3 times 2 minus 2 and this is 12 which is greater than zero and so that capital n that we dealt with we know that we will call that capital n the point zero so what we have is something like this something like this so this is our xaxis and this is the yaxis and we know when x is 1 we're negative we're somewhere down here below the axis but then when x is 2 we're above the axis and this is a polynomial function so we know it's continuous so in order to get from below the axis to above the axis you have to cross somewhere between one and two to get from below to above you have to cross the axis now i'm not saying exactly where it is all this says is that it crosses the axis somewhere between negative one and two who knows it might cross many times but we're just trying to show that there exists at least one crossing in that interval now we're going to shift gears a little bit and talk about uh velocities so we're going to say that f of x is the position of an object now when you think of velocities you might think about you know moving in a car and the speed limit is given by miles per hour or distance over time so we would say that the average velocity is equal to the displacement over time which in this case would be f of a plus h minus f of a all over h but as you know if you're driving in the car your your speed or your velocity changes constantly and so if you want to find the instantaneous velocity we're going to say that the instantaneous velocity is given by v of a and that's going to be as time gets smaller and smaller so not averaged over your whole time span but almost instantly so as your change of time becomes very very small or the limit as that gets closer to zero so we write it the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h and this is the formula for the instantaneous velocity so let's do an example say a ball is dropped from a height of 450 meters above the ground what's the velocity after five seconds well in order to find that we need to first figure out what's the position vector or the position function so that is a standard equation this is going to be we call it s or f of x or f of t rather for time and this is 4.9 times t squared so this right here is something that we're all we will be given now to find the velocity after five seconds we need to figure out the velocity v of t is going to be the limit as h goes to zero of our f of t plus h minus f of t divided by h so this is the limit because h goes to zero of f of t plus h so again we'll do that right down here so this is f of t plus h which is going to be 4.9 times the input squared so 4.9 times t plus h quantity squared which is equal to 4.9 times t squared plus 2 t h plus h squared so plugging that in we get 4.9 times the quantity t squared plus 2 t h plus h squared and then minus f of t which is 4.9 times t squared all over h so you become this becomes the limit as h goes to zero and everything has 4.9 so i can factor out 4.9 from the numerator and so we get t squared plus 2 t h plus h squared minus since we factored out the 4.9 we're just left t squared over here all over h and now our t squareds cancel and so moving this up we get the limit as h goes to zero and notice that each term has an h in it so we can factor out the h so we get h times the quantity two t plus h all over h and our h is now cancel and so this is the limit as h goes to zero of two t plus h and now since we don't have an h in the denominator because we had an h denominator over here we couldn't evaluate it when h went to zero because we'd be dividing by zero but we don't have that problem anymore so this is just 2t plus 0 or just 2t excuse me i forgot we had the 4.9 this whole time so this is 4.9 times all this 4.9 times all that 4.9 times all that and 4.9 times all of that which means this is going to be 9.8 times t so this is we get v of t is 9.8 times t and if we're trying to find the velocity after the ball dropping for five seconds this is nine point eight times five plugging this in we get that this is going to be 49 and we're doing in meters per second and if i were to ask what is the time when the ball hits the ground well we would need to figure out time so recall the position vector is going to be f of t is equal to 4.9 t squared that's a t not an x so f of t is 4.9 t squared we wanted the position to be on the ground so it will have traveled 450 meters and so this is just a problem that we can solve and so we solve this we get t squared is 450 over 4.9 which means that t is approximately 9.6 seconds by taking the square root of both of these so it hits the ground after 9.6 seconds well what's the speed when it hits the ground what's its velocity well the velocity when it hits the ground we just use this formula that we found v of t is 9.8 times our time 9.6 and so we get that this is about 98 meters per second so if you drop the ball at 450 meters above the ground and you let it fall when it hits the ground it'll be uh traveling and hitting the ground excuse me this is 94 meters per second it'll hit the ground at 94 meters per second now we have another definition and we say that the derivative of a function f at a number a so a derivative of a function f at a number e and we're going to say this is going to be denoted denoted by when we write derivatives what we write is going to use this function f of a but then we write this prime we call this a prime it looks like an apostrophe but it's a prime f of a and we're going to give the equation for f prime of a equals the limit as h goes to 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a divided by h and this is going to be provided that the limit exists so if the limit exists so this is the derivative of of a function f at a number a now an equivalent way of writing this from just like how earlier we there are two different ways of writing it we can rewrite the derivative as the following we can rewrite so this is a new thing f prime of a is equal to the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus f of a divided by x minus a all right so let's do an example find the derivative of the function f of x is equal to x squared minus 8x plus 9 at the number a so what we have to do is we want to find f prime of a and by definition that is the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h so let's figure out what's f of a plus h so if f of x is x squared minus 8x plus 9 f of a plus h is going to be a plus h squared minus 8 times a plus h plus 9 which is a squared plus two a h plus h squared minus eight a minus eight h plus nine so we have this is the limit h goes to zero of a squared plus two a h plus h squared minus eight a minus eight h minus nine and we're subtracting f of a so this would be minus x squared minus a negative so this is going to be plus or excuse me not a not x it should be a squared plus 8 a minus 9 and this is going to be all over h so simplifying we get let's see we have our oops this should be a plus nine not a minus nine okay so now we have our a squared and our minus a squared cancels and then our plus nine and our minus nine cancels so we get the limit as h goes to zero of two a h plus h squared and then our negative eight a and our positive 88 also cancel minus 8 h and that's it all divided by h now if you notice everything has an h in it so we can cancel out our h's that h cancels that h cancels and the h squared just become power of one and then we divide the h in the denominator so this is now the limit as h goes to zero of two a plus h minus eight and we can now evaluate this limit when h is zero so this is two a plus zero minus eight or two a minus eight so this is equal to our derivative evaluated at the point a so now we have another way of expressing the tangent line and we say that the tangent line to the function y is equal to f of x at the point a comma f of a is the line through the point a comma f of a whose slope is equal to is equal to the derivative f prime of a so this is derivative of f at a now we have something called the instantaneous rate of change and this instantaneous rate of change is equal to the limit as delta x goes to 0 of delta y over delta x so rate of change the change of y over change in x just like our slopes so this is one way of writing it or we could rewrite it as the limit as say your point x two goes to your point x x1 of f of x2 minus f of x1 over x2 minus x1 and this is if something we have like delta x is given two points and that's really our x2 minus our x1 and then our delta y is y2 minus y1 so we had some sort of curve like this and we had x1 x2 that would be f of x1 f of x2 or we can just say that this length is delta x that length is delta y and so finally we have one last thing in this section and this is the derivative f prime at e is the instantaneous rate of change of y equals f of x with respect to x when x is equal to a in this section we'll talk about derivatives and rates of change but before we start we'll talk about something called a tangent a tangent line is some some sort of line that touches a curve but it doesn't cross the curve and so we should assume that this tangent line will have the same direction as the curve and at that point of co right at that point of contact so for example if we have a curve that looks something like this the tangent right here at that point should be a line that touches right here and has that same direction if we had the tangential point down here is going downward and so the tangent line would look something like this so if we were to have some curve that looks something like this we have x and our y axis and then we have some point right here we call this point a and if this is our function f of x this value would be f of a now if we picked some arbitrary value x let's just say some x values over here and then we had this would be our f evaluated at that x value we have two points now if we're trying to find the tangent line right here if we're trying to find the tangent line right here we want the tangent line to go through here and has something like that so right there is we have a straight line well if we want to find the equation of a line what we need is we need to figure out what's the slope so now we know the equation of a slope is m is the change in height over so the change in the y value over the change in the x value changing the y value f of x minus f of a and the change in the x value is x minus a that's our slope just rise over run so now we'll have our first definition and this definition will say the following the tangent line to the curve y equals f of x at the point a comma f of a is the line through our point through our point with slope m equals now taking a look at this we pick some arbitrary x but this is somewhat accurate but if our point we're way out here i'm going to be let's say over here that's not a really good representation of what the slope looks like so what we want is we want as close as possible to pick our x value to get a more accurate slope so if we want it to be as close as possible we take the limit as x approaches a so we want x to be very very close to a so we're taking x as it gets closer and closer to a so we want this limit of f of x minus f of a divided by x minus a provided the limit exists so that's our definition of a tangent line sometimes we actually will call a tangent line or rather the slope of a tangent line the slope of the curve so let's do an example find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y equals x squared plus 3 at the point 1 comma 1. so what we want to do is find the equation of a line when we find the equation of the line one of the forms we can use would be y minus y one equals m times the quantity x minus x one this is called the pointslope formula because we have our point x1 y1 and we have our slope m well we already know our point that's one comma one so substituting we get y minus one equals m times x minus one so all we need to do is figure out what m is and we'll be done so let's go ahead and do that so remember the definition for the slope is going to be given m is the limit as x approaches our a value and remember this 1 comma 1 that's really our a comma f of a so this is the limit as x approaches one really the x value of the point we're doing of the quantity f of x minus f of 1 divided by x minus 1. well let's substitute what's f of x f of x well that's right here so that's going to be so we take the limit as x approaches 1 of x squared plus 3 minus i'll put these in parentheses minus what's f of one well plugging in one for x we get one squared plus three all over x minus one if i take out the parentheses we get this is x squared plus 3 minus 1 because 1 squared is just 1 minus 3 all over x minus 1 and our 3 and minus 3 cancel and so we're left with the limit as x approaches 1 of x squared minus 1 over x minus 1. now we can't just plug this right into the limit because if we plugged in one we'd be dividing by zero right here but you might have noticed that x squared minus one can be reduced so we now can write this as limit as x minus one x squared minus one becomes x minus one times x plus one divided by x minus one and now we can cancel so this is the limit as x approaches one of just the quantity x plus one and now we can plug in one in for x and so we're left with this is just going to be 1 plus 1 which is 2. so our slope is 2 plugging it back into the formula so we get y is the y minus 1 is equal to 2 times the quantity x minus one and so this is our answer now this is a perfectly acceptable answer uh for me but if you turn it on the homework it depends on the format it may not be acceptable but if you turn it in for quiz or test this is fine but i'm going to simplify it just to as an exercise so this is going to be y minus 1 equals 2x minus 2. i just distributed and now i add 1 to both sides and so we get y is equal to 2x minus 1. both of these represent the same line it's just written in different forms now sometimes it might be easier to write given our curve something like this where we had our point let's say a and so that would be our f of a that'll be our function instead of having some point x out here what we could do so i'm going to erase that x so instead of having a point x like that what we can write is let's just say this distance right here would be h so we say we're just h distance apart from a which means that the value of that point would be a plus h and then the y value would be f of a plus h so now we're just dealing with how far we are away from a so instead of some value x we're just saying that a plus h or we're just going h away from a so using this notion we can rewrite the equation for the slope of the line this is going to be x is our skin m is equal to the limit as well what we're taking before is the limit as the value x was going towards a so really what that's saying is that the limit of this gap is getting smaller and smaller so we can say this is the limit as h approaches 0 of well the limit is just the slope so the change in your y value the rise so this is going to be f of a plus h minus f of a over the run how far do we go in the x direction well we're just going h so this is going to be divided by h and that's the equation for your slope so this is another way of rewriting what we've learned on the other slide so let's do an example find the equation of the tangent line to the equation y is equal to 3 over x at the point three comma one okay so this three over x that's our f of x so let's begin we wanted to find the equation of a line so that's going to be y minus one is equal to m times x minus three and now we need to find our slope m so that's going to be m is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a divided by h now notice we can't plug in 0 for h right now because we'd be dividing by zero which is not something we can do so we will start simplifying so this is limit as h goes to zero f of a plus h well what happens if you plug in a plus h into this function that's really just your x values so this becomes 3 over a plus h minus f of a is 3 over a so just take a little note right here if your f of x is 3 over x f of a is three over a all we're doing is just simply taking whatever is the input and writing it wherever their x was so in our case we had this is f of a plus h this becomes 3 over a plus h the same way you might treat something like if this is just a box this is just 3 over that box whatever goes inside gets replaced and now continuing back here this is all divided by h well what we have is we're subtracting two fractions and when we work with fractions we want to find a common denominator so this becomes the limit as h goes to 0 of 3 over a plus h times a over a minus 3 over a times a plus h over a plus h all over h which simplifies to the limit as h goes to zero of three a minus three a minus three h all over a times a plus h all over h so what i did there was i just distributed this right there so we get 3a minus 3a that cancels and so we end up with the limit as h goes to 0 of negative 3h divided by a times a plus h and this is all over h and so if we're dividing by h let me just pull this up again this is all going to be over h and now remember that our a value was 3 that was the x value of the point so plugging that in let me go ahead and just give myself a little bit more space again so plugging that in we get the limit as h goes to zero of negative 3h divided by 3 times 3 plus h all over h so if we're dividing by h it's the same as multiplying by 1 over h so we have something like that and now our h's will cancel those h's cancel so we take the limit as h goes to zero of and then also our threes cancel so this is just negative one over three plus h and now we take the limit as h goes to zero this becomes negative one over excuse me negative one over three plus zero or just negative one third so that's our slope going back up here filling it in we get our equation is y minus one is equal to negative one third x minus three and that's our answer previously we talked about the derivative of a function at a point f prime of a is equal to the limit as h approaches 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a divided by h but now in this section instead of just talking about the derivative at a single point we'll think of the derivative as an equation and so we will have instead of at a single point at some arbitrary value x or some input value of x f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h minus f of x excuse me f of x all over h so this is the formula for the derivative at any point x or as a function of x rather now let's say we have the graph of some function and the graph might look like this so this is x y and this is our function f of x if we wanted to graph the derivative of this function what would that look like so we wanted to find f prime of x well remember the derivative is really the slope of the line at each point so let's examine the slopes well we have a positive slope going up here then it becomes negative and positive and negative and positive and negative well when it goes from positive to negative right here at this peak it is zero slope and same thing down here if you're going from a negative to positive you pass zero so right here is the zero slope zero slope zero and zero so we can fill in all those gaps so this point right here gets translated down to here zero this point is also zero this point becomes zero this point is also zero and then here that's also zero so now we have three points for our derivative now looking back over here we have a positive slope positive slope means it's going to be above the axis positive means we're above so we're sum some value above the axis now looking over here it's a negative slope so we would be below the axis so we're going to come down negative and then we go back up to zero and if you look right here this slope right here is a negative but it's not too steep over here it's a very steep and then it's not too steep so if it's not too steep it's a smaller number so not too steep right here means negative but just a small negative so something like this very steep over here is negative and a large negative and then over here we have a negative but it's not that much of a negative so smaller so we might have it looking something like that and same thing as we go over here we're going to be increasing so it's a positive slope the the slope is not too big right here it's a small positive it's a bigger positive and then it goes back to a small positive so let me just draw that into a small positive a bigger positive and then a smaller positive so small positive big positive and a small positive and our graph might look something like that and then same thing in this section right here small positive it becomes steeper and then not as steep so excuse me all negative so negative back up and then over here we have positive so it goes positive and back down and then finally this is all going to be negative and so we're gonna be negative and this is sort of a sketch of what the derivative might look like really what we do is we first look at what are the zeros and that's these peaks and we can tell all those points the zeros tell us when it crosses the axis and then the slope tells you if it's positive then you're above the axis if it's a negative slope then you're below the axis now let's do an example if we're given f of x is equal to x cubed minus x let's find the formula for the derivative well f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of the following f of x plus h minus f of x all over h so this is the limit as h goes to zero of well we need to figure out what's f of x plus h well that would be the following this would be x plus h quantity cubed minus x plus h all minus x cubed minus x all over h now notice we have x plus h quantity cubed so i'm already going to tell you what that is you can calculate it yourself but x plus h quantity cubed is x cubed plus 3 x squared h plus 3 x h squared plus h cubed and you can find that on your own just by multiplying out so we have the limit as h goes to zero of x cubed plus three x squared h plus three x h squared plus h cubed minus x minus h minus x cubed and then a minus a negative means we have a plus x this is all going to be divided by h and so we can cancel some things our x cubes cancel and then our x's will also cancel so we're left with the limit as h goes to zero of three x squared h plus three x h squared plus h cubed minus h all divided by h now notice everything has an h so we can start canceling our h's this h cancels this h squared becomes h just to the power one h cubed becomes h squared and this h cancels and when we divide h divided by h you're just left with 1 and then we cancel out our denominator so this becomes the limit as h goes to 0 of 3x squared plus 3x h to the power 1 plus h squared minus 1. we can evaluate this now and so we get this is equal to three x squared plus three x times zero because we're evaluating when h is zero plus zero squared minus one or 3x squared minus 1 and that's our answer so if we're given the function f of x is equal to x cubed minus x the derivative f prime of x is three x squared minus one okay and so if we're to graph this what what this looks like is the following the cubic function x cubed minus x looks something like this the graph of the derivative f prime of x is a parabola so if we were to graph that below we would see well right here it's a maximum it has a slope of zero so that's where it crosses and we also have a maxim a minimum another slope of zero it's right here and then we see over here we have a positive slope and another positive slope so we're going to be above the axis like this and like this and then we see in the middle we have a negative slope so we'll be below the axis we start we start off at a small negative it becomes steeper and then become a smaller negative so small negative steeper means it's a larger number and then back to a smaller number and that's exactly what this is this is a parabola and so you can see the difference between f of x and f prime of x let's do another example if we have our function f of x is the square root of x what's the derivative of the function well to find that we get f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x all over h so we get the limit as h goes to zero of the square root of x plus h minus the square root of x all divided by h well what can we do in a situation like this when you see the subtracting two different square roots the first thing you want to think about is rationalizing the numerator and what i mean by that is by multiplying by the conjugate so we multiply by almost the same thing but instead of it being minusing we add the two so we get a square root of x plus h plus the square root of x over the square root of x plus h plus the square root of x so what this does is this simplifies the numerator we have two things multiplied by each other so for example if we had a minus b times a plus b that's the difference of squares and this becomes a squared minus b squared well it so if each of these are the square root what we would have is the square root of x plus h squared so the square root of x plus h quantity squared is just going to be x plus h and then minus the square root of x quantity squared just is going to be x and then our denominator would be h times this whole thing on the right square root of x plus h plus square root of x but we can simplify this and so we get the limit as h goes to zero well the numerator is x plus h minus x so our x's will cancel and we're just left with h on the numerator divided by h times the quantity square root of x plus h plus the square root of x and now notice they both have an h in it in the numerator and denominator and that cancels so we're left with the limit as h goes to 0 of 1 over the quantity x plus h square root of x plus h plus square root of x now we can evaluate it when h is zero and so this is one over the square root of x plus zero plus the square root of x so this is one over square root of x plus square root of x which is one over two square root of x so the key to this problem was recognizing if we had two square roots you would multiply it by the conjugate and rationalize the numerator so we'll do another example where if we're given f of x is x divided by x minus one the derivative f prime of x is going to be the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x all over h so this is the limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h becomes x plus h divided by x plus h minus 1 minus x over x minus 1 all over h so we're subtracting two fractions so what we want to do is find a common denominator and so that common denominator is going to be x plus h minus 1 times x minus 1. and so in order to make this first this first fraction have that denominator we need to multiply by x minus one over x minus one and then the second one what we need to do is multiply it by x plus h minus one over x plus h minus 1 and again this is all still over h so we have the limit as h goes to 0 and now we'll distribute and multiply this out so we get the following we get x squared plus xh minus x minus h minus x squared minus x h plus x all over the common denominator of x plus h minus 1 times x minus 1 and since we have we're dividing by another h it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal multiplying by one over h and so we can start cancelling our x squareds cancel and i think i made mistakes somewhere oh yes right here so what we had uh this should be x squared minus xh instead of this being an h this should have been a plus x so we had x times 1 or minus x times negative 1 will give us a plus x so there's the mistake that i had so now we have our negative x and this x right here cancels and so we're left with the limit as h goes to 0 of xh minus h minus xh oh and those uh xhs will also cancel too so so rather we're just left with so these cancel so we're just left with minus h over x plus h minus one over x minus 1 times this 1 over h that we had at the end now that means our h's will cancel and we're left with the limit as h goes to zero of negative one over x plus h minus one times x minus one evaluating the limit when h is zero we get this is negative one over x plus zero minus one times x minus one well this term is just x minus one so this is negative one over x minus one quantity squared now we have a definition and this definition says that a function f is differentiable at a if f prime of a exists then we say it is differentiable on the open interval or on an open interval say this interval is from a to b or really it could also be from a to infinity or let's say negative infinity to a or even negative infinity to positive infinity so on some interval we have its differentiable if it is differentiable at every number the interval we now have a theorem this theorem states the following if f is differentiable at the point a then f is continuous at a so now you might want to might ask yourself when would a function not be differentiable we'll talk about that in a minute now when can a function not be differentiable there are three possibilities the first possibility is that something called a corner exists and what that means is that you might have a smooth curve and then all of a suddenly it goes right here and it goes just straight down not smooth just a little kink in the curve something like that and like that when you see that in the graph it is continuous but it's not smooth there's a little corner happening so the first thing is a corner the second thing is that if we have a discontinuity meaning we might have the graph that looks like this and then it continues like that it's not continuous at that point right here and so it is not differentiable at that point now the third possibility is that if there is a vertical tangent line so meaning that the limit as x approaches a of f prime of x is equal to infinity or the vertical tangent line is at the point x equals a now we we found that given a function f we can find its derivative by and we denote it that way but the derivative is a function on itself we can take the derivative of the derivative in which case if we have f prime and we take its derivative we could write it like this and this is what we would say is the second derivative of f and so another way of writing this if we have that y is equal to our function f of x the derivative d dx of the following d y d x is equal to d squared y over d x squared this is notation used by leibniz so this first term this is really saying the derivative of this is another way of writing the first derivative so instead of writing f prime of x we could have written it as d y d dx and then this term over here this is what we call the second derivative similarly we can calculate the third derivative so y triple prime is can also be written as f triple prime of x which means we're taking the derivative d dx of the second derivative so d squared y dx squared and what that comes out to is d cubed y d x cubed now these are just ways of writing the same thing you might see it as just a triple prime or you might see it like this but it just all means the same thing the third derivative so let's do an example if we're given f of x is equal to x cubed minus x find the first second and third derivatives from the earlier video we found that the first derivative f prime of x is equal to three x squared minus one so to find the second derivative f double prime of x we just need to take the derivative of this of the first derivative so this is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f prime of x plus h minus f prime of x all over h so we have the limit as h goes to zero of three times the quantity x plus h squared minus one minus 3x squared minus 1 all over h so we get the limit as h goes to 0 of 3 x squared plus six x h plus three h squared minus one minus three x squared plus one all over h now our ones will cancel and our three x squareds will also cancel leaving us with the limit as h goes to zero of six x h plus three h squared all over h and now we can cancel our h's and our h squareds cancel so this is the limit as h goes to zero of six x plus three h and now evaluating that when h is zero we get this is six x plus three times zero or just six x so filling that in up here we get that the second derivative f double prime of x is 6x and then finally to find the third derivative we get f triple prime of x is the limit as h goes to zero of the second derivative of f of x plus h minus the second derivative of f of x all over h which is the limit as x goes to zero of remember the derivative is just six x so so we have this is going to be six times x plus h minus six x all over h so we get the limit as h goes to zero of six x plus six h minus six x over h and our six x's cancel so this is the limit as h goes to zero of six h over h which cancels and that is just six so oops moving all the way back up to the top there we go moving all the way to the top we get our third derivative is just six so we had our function f of x our first derivative our second derivative and our third derivative now that you're familiar with finding the derivative of a function using the limit definition we're now going to go over some formulas that'll make your life a little bit easier so first of all recall if we have f of x is some constant like f of x is equal to three that's the line y equals three and that's a horizontal line well what's the slope of that horizontal line the slope of that horizontal line is zero so the derivative of f of x equals or f prime rather is going to be zero so any sort of constant we're going to have it's going to be zero so the derivative of a constant function function will be d dx of some constant is equal to zero next we'll take a look at what happens if we have our f of x is just simply the line x so really we're looking at the straight line y equals x well what's the slope of that line the slope of that line is just one so we have that the derivative is going to be d dx of x is just one so this is now we're starting to look at different powers now what about the derivative of the function f of x equals x squared well if we use the definition f prime of x is equal to the limit as x rather excuse me as h approaches 0 of f of x plus h minus f of x all over h so this is the limit as h approaches zero of x plus h quantity squared minus x squared all over h which is the limit as h approaches 0 x squared plus 2 x h plus h squared minus x squared all over h and we can cancel our x squareds so this is the limit as h approaches zero of two x h plus h squared all over h and we can cancel our h's so we're left with the limit as h approaches zero of two x plus h evaluating this when h is zero we get this is two x plus zero or just two x so therefore we get that if our function is f of x is x squared the derivative f prime of x is 2x it can also be shown that if your f of x is x cubed the excuse me just the derivative of x f prime of x is 3 x squared and even if f of x is x to the 4 we get that the derivative of f is going to be 4 x cubed and you might notice there's a pattern going on which leads us to the next rule this is called the power rule and the power rule says that if n is a positive integer then we have the following then d dx so the derivative of x to the nth power is just the power n times x raised to the power minus one so if you know this formula then you won't have to compute the limit or the derivative by using the limits so let's do some examples so let's calculate one if we're given let's say f of x is equal to x to the sixth two if we're given that g of x is x to the one hundred three how about h of t is equal to t to the seventh and maybe um how about k of t or maybe let's use r k of r so that should be r is equal to r cubed so to find the derivative of each of these we would have f prime of x or you might see it written as d dx of f or d dx of x to the six well we take the power six times x to the power minus one if i just slide this over a little bit to the power minus one so x to the six minus one which is six x to the fifth same thing for our g so g prime of x is d dx of x to the 100 which is going to be 100 times x to the 100 minus 1 or 100 x to the 99 the derivative of h so h prime of t well since we're dealing with t instead of writing d dx this would be d dt of t to the seven and this is going to be seven times t to the seven minus one or seven t to the sixth and finally for r for our k so the derivative of k with respect to r so d d r of r cubed is going to be 3 r to the 3 minus 1 or 3 r squared the next row we have is the constant multiple rule and the constant multiple rule states the following if c is a constant and then the function f is differ is a differentiable function it's a differentiable function then we have the following we have that the derivative d dx of c times our function f of x is just equal to the constant c times the derivative of f of x so we can actually pull the constant out in front this way we don't need to compute a whole another derivative we just take the constant in front and then we can figure out what the derivative of f of x's so an example of this would be if we have we're trying to compute the derivative of five x to the sixth this is the same as computing five times the derivative of x to the sixth because five is just a constant we pulled it in front right here and now we know the derivative of x sub 6 by using the power rule so this is going to be 5 times the derivative of x to the 6 is 6 x to the 6 minus 1 or x to the fifth so we have our answer is 30 x to the fifth the next rule that we have is called the sum rule the sum rule says that if we have two functions f and g and they are both differentiable then what we have is the sum of the two the derivative of the sum of the two d dx of f of x plus g of x is equal to the sum of each of their derivatives d d x of f of x plus ddx of g of x another way you might write this using the prime notation is that f plus g prime is equal to f prime plus g prime the next rule we have is the difference rule and this says similar to the sum rule that if f and g are both differentiable then we have that the derivative of the difference of the two is going to be the difference of the derivatives meaning d dx of f of x minus g of x is equal to d dx of f of x minus d dx of g of x so in other words if we take f minus g prime this is f prime minus g prime so if we did an example and we're trying to find the derivative of the following three x to the seven minus four x to the fifth plus two x to the 4 minus 7 x plus 2 well we can break this up into individual pieces so this is going to be the derivative of 3x to the 7 minus the derivative of 4x to the fifth plus the derivative of 2x to the 4 minus the derivative of 7x plus the derivative of 2. well this first one derivative of 3x to the 7 well 3 is a constant so we can pull that out and that's 3 times the derivative of x to the 7 minus and then the next term we can pull out 4 so we get the derivative of x to the fifth plus we can pull out two so we get the derivative of x to the four pull out seven times the derivative of x plus well the derivative of a constant is just zero so we don't need to worry about that now the derivative of x to the seven is seven x to the sixth because we took power seven and subtracted one the derivative of x to the fifth is going to be 5 x to the 4 and we get plus 2 and the derivative of x to the 4 is going to be 4x cubed and the derivative of x is just x so really the derivative of x think about is x to the power of one so that's one times x to the one minus one or well one minus one is x to the zero and anything to the zero power is one so this is just one so here we have 21 x to the sixth minus 20 x to the four plus eight x cubed minus seven and there's no x here because it's really x to the zero power the next rule we have is called the product rule and the product rule states the following if we have two functions f and g and they are again both differentiable then we have the following then we have the derivative d dx of the product f of x times g of x that's equal to this is where it gets it may not be as intuitive f of x times the derivative of g of x plus g of x times the derivative of f of x okay so if we have the derivative of the product it's the first term times the derivative of the second plus the second times the derivative of the first so let me write this in prime notation and this says that if we have f times g and the derivative of that this is going to be f times g prime plus g times f prime so let's do an example let's say we have some function like this let's say we have a function capital f of x is going to be six x cubed times seven x to the fourth well you can think of this as our f and this would be our g so the derivative of capital f is going to be the first term 6x cubed times the derivative of the second term 7x to the 4 plus the second term 7x to the 4 times the derivative of the first term 6 x cubed and now we can compute each of these so this is going to be 6 x cubed times the derivative of 7 x to the 4 it's going to be 7 times the derivative of x to the 4 is 4 times x cubed because we're taking 1 less than the power plus 7x to the 4 times 6 times the derivative of x cubed is 3 x squared and so multiplying 6 times 7 times 4 we get 168 and then x cubed times x cubed would give us x to the sixth plus and then multiplying out for here our seven and our six and our three we get 126 and then x to the four times x squared is also x to the sixth so this can simplify to 294 x to the sixth the next rule is called the quotient rule in this rule people can get confused so let's go over this carefully the derivative of the quotient f of x divided by g of x this is equal to the following g of x times the derivative of f of x minus f of x times the derivative of g of x all divided by g of x quantity squared the difficult thing with this is knowing which one comes first since we're subtracting order does matter so we may we need to make sure that we go in this order and then in prime notation this is going to be rather not r but f over g prime equals g times f prime minus f times g prime over g squared so doing an example for this we get we'll do the following if we're given that our function uh let's call this f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus two divided by x cubed plus six the derivative f prime of x is going to be the following so we we look at our numerator and our denominator so we're going to take the denominator which in this case is going to be x cubed plus 6 times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator x squared plus x minus 2 times the derivative of the denominator x cubed plus 6 all divided by the denominator squared so this becomes x cubed plus 6 the derivative of x squared is going to be just 2x the derivative of x is 1 and the derivative of negative 2 is 0 minus we get x squared plus x minus 2 so this this is a plus minus two times the derivative of x cubed is three x squared the derivative of six is zero all divided by x cubed plus six quantity squared moving along we can distribute this x cubed plus six times two x plus one and so we get two x to the four plus x cubed plus twelve x plus six minus three x to the four minus three x cubed plus six x squared all divided by x cubed plus six quantity squared and we can now start combining terms so our x to the fours combine and so we get or we get negative x to the four our x to the power three will combine and so we get for that minus two x cubed we only have one x to the power one so we get plus twelve x oops i skip the x squared so the x squared this term we get plus 6 x squared and then plus 12 x and then we have plus 6 and this will all be divided by x cubed plus 6 quantity squared this is the answer not nice but it is the answer and now we revisit the power rule and the power rule will actually apply before instead instead of just assuming n is a positive integer we can assume if n is any real number then we have the following so then we get d dx of x to the power n is n times x to the n minus one and this works for any power any value n so if we have for example the derivative of x to the pi because pi is a number 3.1415 and so forth that's going to be pi times x to the pi minus 1. we may also have it as a fraction so this might be the derivative of x to the onehalf is going to be onehalf x to the onehalf minus one or onehalf x to the negative one half what about if we have a negative number well same thing applies so the derivative of x to the negative three is going to be negative three x to the negative three minus one which is negative three x to the negative four now we'll do some examples if we're given f of t is the square root of t times a plus b times t find the derivative to find f prime well when computing derivatives and seeing square roots the first thing i do is rewrite it as t to the power of one half times a plus b t so you'll almost always want to write square roots and anything with a radical in terms of the power so calculating the derivative f prime of t what we have is the product and so the derivative of the product is going to be the first term t to the one half times the derivative of a plus b times t plus the second term a plus b times t times the derivative of the first term which is t to the one half so this becomes t to the one half times the derivative of a is a constant so that's zero derivative of b times t is just going to be b plus a plus b times t times the derivative of this is one half t to the power one half minus one or negative one half so we get b times t to the one half plus a plus bt bt times one half t to the negative one half and that's your answer you can leave it like this but if you feel more comfortable writing it back as a fraction or as a radical you can do that b to the square root of t plus a plus b t times one half and t to the negative one half means it moves down to the bottom and then that is just the square root of t so we would have had divided by two times the square root of t and the final example that we'll go over today is going to be dealing with a quotient so if we're given y is equal to the square root of x divided by 1 plus x squared if we wanted to find a derivative that will be the following the derivative is going to be the denominator 1 plus x squared times the derivative of the numerator if you recall if we had something like f over g prime the derivative of this is going to be g times f prime minus f times g prime divided by g squared so that's what we have right here this is our g this is going to be our derivative of f and then continuing on we get minus f so minus our numerator square root of x times the derivative of the denominator 1 plus x squared so this is going to be 1 plus x squared the derivative of x of squared with excuse me the derivative of square root of x which is really x to the one half is one half x to the negative one half minus and i'm just gonna rewrite square as x to the onehalf the derivative of one plus x squared well derivative of 1 is 0 and the derivative of x squared is 2x oops i forgot that this whole thing is all going to be divided by the denominator squared 1 plus x squared squared so this is all divided by 1 plus x squared squared and so simplifying this we get one plus x squared times well times one half which is the same as saying divided by two and just like in the last example x to the negative one half can be written as one over the square root of x minus the next thing is square x to the one half or square root of x times 2x divided by 1 plus x squared quantity squared and so here i'll summarize in the table of all the differentiation formulas we have the following so we have the derivative of a constant is just zero we also have the derivative of x to some power n is just n times x to the power n minus 1 you just subtract 1. if we're multiplying by constant we have c times f the derivative of that is equal to c times the derivative of f if we're adding two functions we have f plus g and the derivative this is the derivative of f plus the derivative of g if we are subtracting two functions f minus g that's going to be f derivative of f minus derivative of g and then we have the product if we have f times g that's just f times the derivative of g plus g times the derivative of f and finally the quotient if we have f divided by g the derivative of that whole thing is g times the derivative of f minus f times the derivative of g divided by g squared these are all very important formulas that you'll need in order to calculate derivatives in this section we're going to talk about the derivatives of trigonometric functions so recall what the graph of sine of x looks like and sine of x starts at zero it goes up comes back down goes back up and repeats and same thing with this and it has a period of 2 pi halfway of that would be pi and then we fill out in the middle of all these this would be 3 pi over 2 this would be pi over 2 and then negative as well so this is the graph of y equals sine of x or let's call this f of x is y equals sine of x now what would the graph of the derivative look like so bringing all these down we have pi we have 3 pi over 2 and 2 pi so the graph of y equals the derivative f prime of x well when we start by graphing the derivatives we want to look at the maximums and minimums because that means the slope is zero and so it crosses right here on the axis now looking over here we have a positive slope it's increasing so it's positive so we're going to be it's going to be with a high positive value and it gets lower and lower until we hit zero so we have a high positive number and it gets smaller and smaller until you hit zero and then you have a negative slope starts off with a little bit of negative and then a lot and then just a little bit so a little negative big negative little bit negative and then excuse me that was wrong uh a little bit negative big negative and then goes back down to a little bit negative and then over here we have positive it's increasing and so small negative bigger negative and as you see this is kind of a crude graph but this kind of looks like the function that we might we might have seen this before this kind of looks like a sine function or a cosine function but it does look very trigonometric and it would repeat back here too now now we have a couple of of equations that i'm going to give you we have that the limit as theta approaches zero of sine of theta over theta well what do you think this is as as theta gets towards zero well sine is also going towards zero but theta is also going towards zero in fact in this case it's just equal to one now we have another one that looks at the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta and this time that is equal to zero and now the derivatives of sine and cosine and we'll talk about that right now if you noticed from the graph from before it sort of looks like the derivative of sine of x is actually equal to cosine of x so this is a pretty important one derivative of sine of x is equal to cosine of x and the derivative of cosine of x not quite equal to sine of x in fact is actually equal to negative sine of x so let's do an example if we have y is equal to x squared times sine of x calculate its derivative so d y d x is equal to the derivative of of uh x squared times the derivative of the second term so derivative of sine of x plus sine of x times the derivative of the first term so this is derivative of sine of x we know to be cosine of x plus sine of x times derivative of x squared 2x so this is our answer but i'm just going to rewrite it x squared cosine of x plus 2x sine of x so let me give you all the derivatives of trigonometric functions so we have the first one the derivative of sine of x and that is cosine of x the second one is the derivative of cosine of x and that is going to be negative sine of x the third derivative is the derivative of tangent of x and this is a little bit different derivative of tangent is going to be secant squared of x and for tangent if you forget how that the derivative is secant squared you can always reprove it by looking at tangent is sine over cosine and using the quotient formula the next derivative is d dx of cosecant of x and that's going to be negative cosecant of x times cotangent of x and then we have the derivative of secant of x and that's going to be secant of x times tangent of x and these two again if you forget how to do that you can always rely on the quotient formula because cosecant of x is one over sine of x and then you can use the quotient rule or you can even use the power rule sine of x to the power negative one to solve all this and the final trig function that we have is the derivative of cotangent of x and that's just negative cosecant squared of x now let's do an example if f of x is equal to secant of x divided by 1 plus tangent of x what is the derivative f prime of x well we're going to use the quotient formula which says the following which says the denominator 1 plus tangent of x times the derivative of the numerator plus or excuse me not plus but minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator 1 plus tangent of x all divided by the denominator squared so here we have this is going to be 1 plus tangent of x the derivative of secant of x is secant x tangent x minus secant of x times the derivative of one plus tangent of x well the derivative of one is zero and the derivative of tangent of x is secant squared of x all divided by one plus tangent squared of x quantity squared now we're going to simplify but notice that every there there's a secant of x in all these terms so i'm going to first factor out secant of x and so what i have left after i factor out secant of x is going to be 1 plus tangent of x times tangent of x minus secant squared of x all divided by 1 plus tangent squared of x quantity squared or secant of x times the quantity tangent of x plus tangent squared of x minus secant squared of x all over 1 plus tangent squared of x quantity squared now we could be done but we can actually simplify this just a little bit further notice we have a trig identity that says tangent squared of x plus 1 is equal to secant squared of x or rewriting this tangent squared of x minus secant squared of x is equal to negative one and so we can simplify this further secant of x times tangent of x minus 1 all over 1 plus tangent squared of x quantity squared so this is our final answer but if you use this one right before it that would be acceptable in class the final example that we're going to do today is going to be the following find the limit as x approaches zero of sine of seven x divided by four x now recall that we do know what would happen if we took the limit as theta goes to zero of sine of theta over theta and that equals one the thing here is that we don't just have uh it's not just x it's seven 7x so we need to do some simplifications first now if it looked something of the form the limit as x approaches zero of sine of seven x over seven x that would equal one because instead of writing theta we just wrote seven x each time we saw it so is there a way that we can do that let's take a look so this is going to be the limit as x goes to 0 of sine of 7x over 4x and now what we're going to do is we're going to rewrite this and we're going to multiply 7 over seven so now this is going to be the limit as x goes to zero of and i'm actually going to swap places of this four and seven so we're going to have this is going to be sine of 7x divided by 7x times 7 over 4. and it's important to note right now that if we have sine of 7x this is not equal to 7 times sine of x so just make sure to note that and that's why we're having problems and we need to make further simplifications now we're going to make the substitution theta is equal to 7x okay so this is going to be the limit so instead of writing seven x this is sine of theta over theta and then times seven fourths the only thing is that now x was going to zero so looking here at the substitution if x goes to zero what does theta go to well theta will also go goes to zero so as x goes to zero so does theta so theta also goes to zero so it's the limit as theta goes to zero and now this looks like the form that we know this is going to be this whole thing is just one times seven over four and so our answer is seven fourths today we're going to talk about the chain rule if we're given some function let's say capital f of x and that function is equal to sine of x squared plus 1 how would you calculate the derivative of this well what we have here is this here is a composite function a composite function looks something of the form like y if that were equal to our f of x then that would look like little f composed of the function g of x or you might see it with a little circle like this f of g so in this case our outer function little f would be something like this we'd say y is equal to little f of for now we're just going to ignore that and so that's little f of u and our outer function dealing with right here is going to be the sign so we'd say this is just sine of some u and then for our inner function what would u be well u is our g of x and the inside of this the inside of the sign is x squared plus 1. so now taking the derivative of this whole thing the composite function sine of the quantity x squared plus 1 we would have to take the derivative of sine but we also have to take the derivative of x squared plus one so this leads us to the following if we wanted to take the derivative with respect to y or the derivative of y excuse me with respect to x what we would do is take the derivative by looking up here so if y is this uh or rather y is this the derivative of y with respect to well if we look here it's a function of u so this would be the derivative of y with respect to u times then we take the chain rule and this is the derivative of u with respect to x so now i'm going to go ahead and write this up formally the chain rule states the following if g is differentiable at the point x and f is differentiable at g of x then the composite function and we're going to define that to be capital f is little f of little g so to find capital f of x is little f of little g of x then this is differentiable at x and then the derivative capital f prime is given by the product and i'm going to move that up give me some spaces given by the product capital f prime of x equals little f prime of g of x times g prime of x or another way of writing this is that if y equals f of u and u equals g of x then we have for the product rule or rather the chain rule excuse me d y d x is d y d u times d u d x so now we'll go ahead and actually solve the example that we started with we defined our function capital f of x to be sine of the quantity x squared plus one and so if capital f was equal to little f of g of x this capital f of x then our f of some u is going to be sine of u and our g of x was the inside so x squared plus 1. we can compute each of these derivatives and so f prime f prime of u is derivative of sine is cosine of u and g prime of x is equal to x squared plus one now what was our u what is the u that we're dealing with well that's right here sine of u u is the inside of the sign so we know that u is equal to x squared plus one now using the formula that we have we know that the derivative of capital f of x is equal to f prime of g of x times g prime of x okay and so this u right here that was just our g of x so plugging it in we get f prime is cosine of u and u was x squared plus one so this is cosine of the quantity x squared plus one times g prime and g prime oh excuse me this is wrong it's the derivative of x squared plus one so the derivative of x squared is two x so this is times 2x and this is our derivative so basically what we need to do when we're taking the derivative of a composite function is take the outside function in this case sine the derivative of sine is cosine and you leave everything else the same and then you multiply it by the derivative of the inside the derivative of x squared plus 1 is 2x and there you go so if we put that into words what we have is that this is the derivative of the outer function but we're going to evaluate it at the inner function and then all that is going to be multiplied by the derivative of the inner function okay so the the chain rule says we have some big function like this you take the derivative of the outer function f prime evaluated at the inner function g of x and multiply that whole thing by the derivative of the inner function g prime so let's do another example so if we had y is equal to three x squared plus one raised to the power two now we could expand this and then take the derivative of that or we could just take the derivative using the chain rule so using the chain rule the outer function here is something that's being squared so our little f of u is u squared and then the inner function g of x is three x squared plus one so the derivative f prime of u is just 2u and g prime of x is 6x so the derivative d y d x is going to be the derivative of the outer function so the derivative of the outer function f is 2 times the original 2 times the inner function 2u so this so this is 3x squared plus 1 multiplied by the derivative of the inner function 6 x and there you go now you could simplify this this would be 12x times the quantity 3x squared plus 1 or 36 x cubed plus 12x so this leads us to a new rule the chain rule involving a power rule so the power rule combined with the chain rule and so for that what we have is that if n is any real number and u equals g of x is differentiable then we have the following the derivative with respect to x so d dx of u to the power n is equal to n times u to the n minus 1 that's the derivative of u times the chain rule times the derivative of u with respect to x okay so what we did here is the the power rule so anything to the power n becomes n times that function to the n minus but if u is a function we want to also take the derivative of u so an alternate way of writing this would be the following d dx of g of x to the power n is n times our function g of x raised to the n minus 1 times g prime of x so let's do another example if we're given the function g of x is equal to the quantity t minus two divided by two t plus one to the power nine we can compute its derivative g prime of x is going to be remember we're taking the derivative of the outside what's the outside function here that's the power nine so the derivative would be nine times the inside function to the power eight right anything to the power nine would be nine times that raised to the power of eight and then we have to take the derivative of the inside times the derivative of the inside t minus two over two t plus 1. now it's a little bit harder because we have to use the quotient rule so we get 9 times the quantity t minus 2 over 2t plus 1 to the power 8 times the quotient rule remember the quotient rule says the denominator 2t plus 1 times the derivative of the numerator in this case the derivative of the numerator is one minus the numerator t minus two times the derivative of the denominator the derivative of two t plus one is just 2 all divided by the denominator squared and so we can go ahead and expand this and what we would get is the following we get 9 times the quantity t minus 2 to the 8 over 2t plus one oops that should be a plus one to the eight times that in this fraction we get from here we get two t and so we get two t plus plus one minus two t minus a negative so plus four all over two t plus one to the power two give me a little bit more space we can then get nine times t minus two to the power eight our two t's will cancel and then our one plus four gives us five and then all in the denominator 2t plus 1 to the 8 times 2t plus 1 to the 2 will give us 2t plus 1 to the 10. so 9 times 5 gives us 45 so that cancels 45 times the quantity t minus 2 to the 8 divided by 2t plus 1 to the 10 and that's our answer now what if our function f of x is sine of cosine of tangent of x well to take the derivative we just apply the chain rule and we're going to apply it twice so we have sine of all this stuff on the inside so taking the derivative we first take the derivative of the outer function derivative of sine would give us cosine in fact i'm going to change my color right here just so that we can see that so derivative of sine is going to be cosine and the inside stays the same of cosine of tangent of x times the chain rule times the derivative of the inside so we're going to take the inside right here so the derivative of cosine of tangent of x and so we get the following so this is going to be this equals cosine of cosine of tangent of x times well the derivative over here derivative of this it's another composite function the derivative of the outside so the derivative of cosine is going to be negative sine of tangent the derivative of cosine is negative sine times the chain rule times the derivative of the inside times d dx of tangent of x and so putting this all together we get cosine of cosine of tangent of x times this negative i'm going to put the negative all the way in front so time so negative of the whole thing times sine of tangent of x times the derivative of tangent is secant squared of x and so this right here is the derivative now most of the functions we've dealt with so far are of the form y is equal to f of x and we can we can write everything just in terms of x but sometimes there's other equations that aren't as simple for example the equation of a circle is x squared plus y squared equals 5 squared and this is a circle with radius 5. how would you take the derivative of this because we can't just solve it in terms of y we could get y squared is 25 minus x squared but when we solve for y you're going to get y is equal to plus or minus the square root of 25 minus x squared and so we actually get two functions the positive square root and the negative square root so what we do when we have something like the equation of a circle is the following if we're given x squared plus y squared equals 25 and we want to take the derivative of everything we write it as the derivative with respect to x of x squared plus y squared is the derivative with respect to x of we're taking the derivative of both sides now the derivative going through this first term the derivative of x squared with respect to x so that would be d dx of x squared plus the derivative of y squared with respect to x d dx of y squared and then dx of 25. so let's compute each of these derivatives well the derivative with respect to x of x squared so this right here is just 2x for now i'm going to leave this as it is and the derivative of 25 that's a constant so that's just zero but we need to first figure out what this derivative is so i'm going to change my color and we've got to figure out what that derivative is so the derivative with respect to x of y squared is going to be the following we can use the chain rule and so that's the derivative with respect to y of y squared times the chain rule the derivative of y with respect to x so the derivative of y of y squared with respect to y is just 2y and then times d y dx so putting this all together we get 2x plus 2y times dy dx is equal to zero when we solve for the derivatives usually what we were trying to find is d y d x going ahead and uh moving this all up we'll rewrite everything in terms of d y d x so we subtract two x from both sides so we get two y times d y d x is negative two x our twos will cancel and then dividing both sides by y we get d y d x is negative x over y and that is your derivative so now just kind of put everything all all in one site and what we did we wanted to find the derivative of this whole thing and so you can think about it as going through just taking the derivatives the derivative of x squared is 2x the derivative of y squared thinking of y as a function of x so of y squared is two y times the chain rule d y d x and then the derivative of 25 so derivative constant is zero rearranging terms solving for d y d x we get the following negative x over y all right let's do another example if we're given that y squared is equal to x squared plus sine of x y solve for solve for the derivative d y d x well we're going to go through our function and just take the derivative as we go through the derivative of y squared is 2y times d y d x equals the derivative of x squared is 2x plus the derivative of sine so this is sine of something on the inside so derivative of sine is cosine of the things inside so cosine of x y times the chain rule times the derivative of the inside the derivative of the inside well that's going to be the product rule okay and we'll do that right now so the derivative of the inside of x times y is the product rule product rule says the derivative of the first term times the second term plus the derivative of the second term times the first term well derivative of x is just one so this is one times y or just y plus the derivative with respect to x of y is just d y d x times x so we can plug this in to right there and we get the following we get 2y times dydx is equal to 2x plus cosine of xy times the quantity y plus d y d x times x now we want all the d y d x's on one side so we need to do some simplification we're going to expand this on the right so this is going to be y times sine of x y plus i'm going to move the x in front x cosine of x y times d y d x and now what we want is we want all the d y is dx is on one side so i'm going to move this term over to the left side by subtracting so we get 2 y d y d x minus x cosine of x y d y d x equals 2 x plus y cosine of x y on the left side they all share this the term d y d x so i can factor that out so we get 2 y minus x cosine of x y times the quantity d y d x and then we have 2x plus y cosine of x y and the last step we want to get d y d x by itself and so we're going to divide by 2y minus x cosine of xy 2y minus x cosine of x y and so the final product or the final derivative d y over dx is equal to 2x plus y times cosine of xy all divided by 2y minus x cosine of xy and this is your derivative today we're going to talk about related rates so we'll begin with an example now the volume of a sphere is given by the following v is four thirds pi times the radius cubed but if we want to find what is the change of volume over time that is dv dt the derivative with respect to time well we take the derivative this is going to be four thirds times pi but we're dealing with r and not t but as the volume changes increases or decreases so will the radius so in fact we're going to use the chain rule and take the derivative of r cubed derivative of r cubed is three r squared now this simplifies our threes will cancel and so we get that the derivative of the volume with respect to time is 4 times pi times r squared now remember the chain rule says that if we take the derivative of r squared we also have to add dr dt so this can be times dr dt and so now if we have the for the example we say we have a balloon increases so air is being pumped into balloon and then a balloon is increasing in volume at a rate of 100 cubic centimeters per second how fast is the radius increasing if the radius of the balloon is 25 centimeters so we're going to use is this equation we have right here we're going to use dv dt is equal to 4 pi r squared times dr dt now what sort of information are we given we're given that the volume is increasing at a rate of 100 cubic centimeters per second so volume is increasing at a rate so we this is going to tell us our dv dt we're also given the radius is 25 centimeters so that's our r and then finally what are we trying to find we want to find how fast is the radius increasing that is we want dr dt so let's plug in what we have and solve dv dt is 100 and that's equal to 4 pi our radius is 25 so times 25 squared times dr dt we're trying to solve for dr dt and so moving everything around what do we get divide both sides by 4 pi times 25 squared 4 pi times 25 squared we get that dr dt is equal to we simplify 100 over 4 and then 4 times 25 is 100 but we have 100 squared so this is just 1 over 25 oops 25 pi and so that is the rate that the radius is increasing and then our units here were centimeters per second now for our next example what if we had a ladder resting on a wall and the ladder is 10 foot long it looks something like this 10 foot long ladder and we have some x length and a y length if you forget to hold the bottom of the ladder down here and the bottom the ladder starts to slide away from the wall so we have a 10 foot ladder and the bottom slides pue at a rate of one foot per second when you're standing at the top of the ladder and you want to know how fast is the top of the ladder going down the wall so what do we do here we want to know how fast the ladder is going down the wall in this case we don't have a nice equation like we did for the volume of a sphere but that's all right what do we have here we have a right triangle so we can relate all the sides using the pythagorean theorem and that says that x squared plus y squared equals the hypotenuse squared which is 10 squared and now what are the pieces of information that we're given it's going away from the wall at a rate of one foot per second so if it's going away that's your x direction and the rate is changing so this is your dx dx dt and what are you trying to find you're trying to find how fast is the ladder moving away from the wall and so this is the how fast the ladder is moving away from the wall that would be or moving down the wall rather that'll be your dy dt and let's say we want to find this when we are six feet from the wall when we're six feet from the wall so that's our x value so we want to find out when x uh so that's when x is six so we can plug this in first of all let's take the derivative we're going to take use the chain rule again so we get 2x times the chain rule dx dt plus 2y times dydt is equal to well what's the derivative of 10 squared or 100 since it's a constant number that derivative is zero so now plugging things in we have two our x value is six so two times six times dx dt and we know dx dt is one from up here plus 2. now do we know our y no we don't know our y but we can figure it out because of the pythagorean theorem if x is 6 we can figure out y so this is going to be 6 squared because that's our x value plus y squared is equal to 10 squared now solving this or if you recognize this is a three four five triangle we end up with y is equal to eight so this can be two times eight times dydt equals zero and so what we get is we get 12 plus 16 d y dt equals zero moving things around we get that your d y d t is equal to negative 3 over 4 feet per second and that makes sense that there's a negative because you're moving downwards your y value is inc is a decreasing that's our answer now let's see we have water going into a tank that's in the shape of an inverted cone so it looks something like this and so given this and we have water going into the tank at a rate of nine cubic feet per minute so so they're going into nine cubic feet per minute and this tank it has a height of 10 feet and the base of the radius is going to be 5 feet so this this tank right here is 10 feet tall so height there's 10 feet and then the the radius at the base that's going to be 5 feet so right here that radius is 5 feet so if we add water to it you know water might come up at this level this might not be all the way up but the tank itself is 10 feet tall and has a radius of 5 feet what i want to know is how fast is the water rising when the water in the tank is 6 feet deep so if when this height is going to be six feet how high is the water changing well we need to do a couple of things here first of all what's the volume what's the equation for the volume of a cylinder that equation is going to be v is equal to 1 3 pi times your radius squared times your height and so we'll let the radius be our bx and then we'll let the height be y so volume is 1 3 pi times x times y now unlike the other problems that we did we only had two variables we had v and then we had something else we didn't have x and y we didn't have v x and y we only want two is there a way that we can reduce this to just two variables well if you take a look at this we actually can and this is by using similar triangles so taking a look at the triangles we have one triangle like this with a height of 10 and a radius of 5. if we look at the other triangle and we had some height let's say y then we could figure out that the x value or the radius would be some x value and so looking at these ratios what we have is x over y is equal to 5 over 10. or if we solve for x x is equal to y over two and so now we can actually plug this in for x so the volume can now be expressed as 1 3 pi times instead of x is going to be y over 2 times y or in other words uh excuse me they should be x squared so the volume is 1 3 pi the radius squared which so this this is really the area of a circle so this should be a squared right there okay so volume is 1 3 pi times y over two quantity squared times y or volume is equal to pi over 12 times y cubed and now we can calculate uh finish this equation or this uh this problem so taking the derivative we get dv dt is equal to pi over 12 times three y squared we're using the chain rule times d y dt our 3 and our 12 cancel so this is really pi over 4 y squared d y dt so if we look back at what the original question was stating and that was we had water going in at a rate of nine feet per minute then that should be cubic feet per minute and we wanted to find when it was six feet deep so that was when y is six feet we'll have the following so the change in volume what was coming in was nine so there should be nine equals pi over four times the change in height which was six squared times d y dt six squared is 36 divided by four that right there simplifies to nine and our nines will now cancel so we have nine over here and 9 over here and they cancel so we have 1 is equal to pi times d y dt solving for d y d t we get that is just one over pi and then the rate of the units rather is feet per minute so there's a couple of strategies that we can use when dealing with these types of problems the first is to read the problem carefully the second thing it really helps to draw a diagram and this is if possible the third thing is to introduce notation so in the problems that we gave they didn't say dydt is equal to so and so or solve for dx dt they just said how what is the the change of height chain um the rate of the change in height and so we had to introduce our own notation to do that so introduce your notation and then you assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time then the next thing we do is we express the given information and the required information or rather the required rate in terms of derivatives the fifth thing is to write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem and if necessary use geometry to eliminate to eliminate one of the variables so to eliminate one of the variables by substitution that's what we did in the last example we had three things and we could substitute we had v x and y and when we found the ratio we could eliminate our x variable by substituting x was y over two number six use the chain rule okay we're going to use the chain rule to differentiate sides of the equation with respect to our variable t all right and the last step for solving these types of problems seven substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the unknown rate and so these steps will help you with your problem solving on related rates now today we're going to talk about linear approximations and differentials now if you recall given some sort of curve like this and this is the curve y is equal to f of x the tangent line at some point right over here at some point a so we'll say this is a comma f of a tangent line is going to go right through that but have this and have the same slope so the tangent line y is equal to let's call this l of x now the point of this is that we might be able to calculate what f of a is but we might not be able to calculate or it might be very hard to figure out what f of x is when x is really near a and so we could do is use this tangent line to help us approximate it because the tangent line near when x is a is a pretty good approximation to the to the curve y equals f of x so if you see when we're here we're pretty close as we get further away there's more of an error to where the y value is but nearby it should be pretty close now if you remember the equation of a line using the pointslope formula that is y minus y1 is equal to m times the quantity x minus x1 if we moved our y1 over we have the equation y is equal to y1 plus m times x minus x1 and this is if we have some point x x1 comma y1 and we have a slope that's going to be m now if the point that we have is this point a comma f of a what we can do is our y our y1 value is f of a and then our x1 value is our a and what's the slope at that point well the slope is the derivative so it's going to be f prime at a so we have f of a plus f prime of a times the quantity x minus a and that is what our rather that's going to be an approximation for f of x so let me rewrite that little bit better so the approximation f of x is approximately equal to some point f of a that we know plus f prime at e times the quantity x minus a and again to help you remember this formula rather than having to remember it from scratch if you just think about the pointslope formula you'll be able to fill in the details so this is what we call a linear approximation or the tangent line approximation okay so this is the linear approximation or the tangent line approximation of f at the point a and if we wrote for the linear function capital l of x is equal to f of a plus f prime of a times the quantity x minus a so using this this is what we call the linearization of f at a so let's do an example let's find the linearization of the function f of x is equal to the square root of one plus x at the point x equals zero okay so what we have here is a square root function and yeah we know some of the square roots but do we know for example the square root of 1.2 well we can approximate that using a linear approximation so remember the formula for the linear approximation l of x is equal to f of a plus f prime at a times the quantity x minus a so we're going to need this but first of all in order to do all that we need to figure out certain things so our in this case our a is zero so we want to figure out what is f of zero well f of zero is going to be the square root of one plus zero which is just one and then we gotta find the derivative f prime at a or f prime of zero so let's first figure out the derivative so the derivative of this and remember our f of x another way to write the square root is one plus x to the power one half so this is going to be one half the quantity one plus x to the negative onehalf or one over two times the square root of one plus x and figuring out what this is evaluating at zero our f prime at zero this is one over two times the square root of one plus zero or just simply one half so now we have everything and we can plug it into the linearization and we get l of x is equal to f of 0 plus f prime of zero times x minus zero well x minus zero that's just x so f prime of zero we get from right here is just one so one plus f prime at 0 that's going to be right here one half times x so our linearization is just 1 plus x over 2. so what this is saying this is the linear approximation for the square root of one plus x is approximately equal to one plus x over two this is when x is near zero so let's actually test this let's see how accurate we are so if we're let's say near zero so or when x is near zero let's say when x is point two so we're trying to find the square root of one plus zero point two which is the square root of one point two now according to the approximation let me see if i can just move this down a little bit there we go so the approximation says the following approximation says that this should be 1 plus 0.2 over 2. that's what we said right here in fact i'll box that or i'll box it right here so this should be approximately one plus point two over two and that is going to be 1.10 now if you plug this in on your calculator you find that the true value for this is 1.095 4 4 5. so we're closeish but let's see this really works well when we're near zero so let's get a little bit closer to zero let's say one plus zero point zero five so we're taking the square root of one point zero five this is going to be according to our linear approximation 1 plus 0.05 over 2 which gives us 1.025 and if we plug this on our calculator what do we get we get 1.024695 that's closer to the true value let's see if we can get better let's get even closer to zero so we're going to say 1 plus 0.005 okay so that's going to be 1.005 which is approximately equal to 1 plus 0.005 all over 2 and according to the linear approximation we get this is one point zero zero two five zero but the true value if you use a calculator this is one point zero zero two four nine seven we're getting closer and closer to the true value the closer and closer we get to zero the closer that this number gets to zero but this is just our linear approximation and that's what we use it for we know how to take the square root of certain numbers like when x is zero and we can use that to find other values so if i said find the linear approximation of f of x equals the square root of one plus x at the point x equals three what we can do is the following so 3 is really our a and so we we want to find l of x at the point a equals 3. well we need a couple of things we need to figure out what is f of three well f of three is the square root of one plus three which is the square root of four or just two we need to compute the derivative and so we know the derivative over here is going to be the derivative at 3 of f remember we calculated the derivative on the other slide so that was one over two times the square root of one plus a so one plus three and so this is going to be 1 4. so the linearization l of x is going to be remember l of x is going to be f of a plus f prime of a times x minus a so we get l of x is f of a which is two from right here plus the derivative which is going to be 1 4 times x minus a times x minus 3. so that's our approximation which using some simplification ends up being 5 4 plus x over 4. now we're going to shift gears and talk about differentials so let y equals f of x and let this be a differentiable function then we see that the differential and the differential dx this differential is an independent variable and then we say that the differential dy that is going to be a dependent variable so the differential d y is a dependent variable and so this is defined as the following we're going to define it to be dependent so it's going to have some sort of dx in it so the derivative f prime times dx and that's why it's dependent because it depends on whatever the x value is now geometrically what this looks like is the following so if we have our curve that's the curve y equals f of x we have some point right here we'll say that that point is p and so that point corresponds to some x value and then we're going to add some delta x to it so this point right here would be x plus delta x so we go up to here and at some distance delta x we're right here but if we approximated it at p and we had some linear approximation or even the tangent line as you may it goes like that and it doesn't quite fit it we have this error right there so if we extended this all the way up and we call this our point r and we call this intersection q then what we would have and we'll maybe extend this over here we'll call this the point s so this distance that we have right here delta x our change in the y value this would be our delta y now if we're using differentials our dx is going to be the same as our delta x but if we're looking up here this big change in y that is d y so our delta x is the same as dx but our delta y is right here and then the d y adds all this extra stuff up there so if we were to express this in terms of an equation what we get is delta y is equal to f of x plus delta x minus f of x so that's how we can get our delta y it's just the y value right here f of x plus delta x minus this height which happens to be the same as f of x now we know this is the slope and so we know slope is rise over run so the slope f prime of x is rise d y d x d rise d y over d x which means that rearranging this we get d y is equal to our slope f prime of x times dx and so here we have two equations that we can use for differentials so i know this may seem confusing so we're going to do an example using these two equations i should probably have highlighted them but i'll just underline them in a different color okay so example we're going to compare our delta y and our d y if we're given y equals f of x which is the function x cubed plus x squared minus two x plus one and we're given that x changes from 2 to 2.05 so take a look at this equation these two equations i'm going to move the screen so you're not going to be able to use them anymore okay so let's begin what we're going to have is we want to figure out what is our delta y and what's our d y to do that what do we need we need a couple of pieces of information to find delta y first well delta y that was our f of x plus delta x so that would have been our f of 2.05 and then we minus our f of x minus f of 2. so let's figure out what's f of 2.5 so f of 2.5 plugging it in to this equation right here i already did that and so f of excuse me not 2.52.05 f of 2.05 is 9.717625 and f of 2 comes out to just 9. so our delta y is 9.717625 minus 9 which is 0.717625 that's our delta y now we're going to find d y so d y is given by the following f prime of x times dx so again on the side we need to figure out what's f prime of x so f prime of x is the derivative of this whole thing derivative of x cubed is 3x squared plus the derivative of x squared is 2x and the derivative of negative 2x is negative 2 and the derivative of 1 is a con that's a constant so it's 0. so that's f prime of x and so if we're doing this at d y is equal to f prime of 2 and then our dx is our 0.05 f prime of 2 is equal to the following 14 and so plugging in we get d y is 14 times 0.05 so we get our d y is going to be 0.7 and you see these two are delta y and our d y they're in the same ballpark but they are in fact different now let's do one more example this last example let's have that the radius of a sphere and this is actually going to be something that we might calculate and this was measured and found to be 21 centimeters and when we calculate when we measure this it might have a possible error in the measurement of at most 0.05 centimeters so what is the maximum error in using the value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere okay so what we did is we measured the the radius but somehow using the tools that we did our tools might give us a maximum error of 0.05 or a possible error in our measurement of 0.05 centimeters what's the maximum error that we could get when we compute the volume so well the volume of a sphere v is equal to four thirds pi r cubed if we let the dr equal delta r and this is going to be our error in the radius then the corresponding error in our volume would be this delta v and we can approximate our delta v using the differential so the differential taking the derivative we get dv is equal to the derivative over here is using the the power rule bring the 3 in front it cancels with that so it's just 4 pi r squared times dr and so if we're doing this when the radius r is measured to be 21 and the possible error in r is measured to be .05 we get dv is 4 times pi times 21 squared times .05 and so therefore we get our dv is approximately equal to 277 cubic centimeters so we computed the volume and the volume can be can have an error of 277 cubic centimeters that might seem pretty big but it might not because depending on the size of what we're dealing with and so this is something that we're going to take a look at and that's something that's called a relative error and let me actually put a little color to this so this is a relative error and the relative error is essentially the following you take your error and you divide it by what the whole thing was so we we're going to take our delta v let me just write this back in black so we're going to take delta v and divide it by v so how big is the error compared to the actual volume and so maybe that's going to be approximately equal to dv over v which is dv is 4 pi r squared times dr over four thirds pi r cubed so that's three times d r over r and so looking at what we had what we get since we had our r and dr this is going to be 3 times 0.05 over 21 and that's approximately about 0.007 and if we converted this to a percent this is zero point seven percent that's pretty good less than one percent and this percentage that we call that's something that's called a the percentage error now we could have solved this without this equation right here all we need to do is find our error divided by the total volume so we could have taken 277 and if we knew what the volume was divided by the volume in this case we didn't but we could have actually computed it by the volume is 4 3 pi r cubed today we're going to talk about maximum and minimum values so we begin with definition if we let c be a number in the domain of then we'll call the domain d of a function f then f evaluated at that point c is going to be called the following it's going to be called the absolute maximum it's the absolute maximum value of the function f on d if f evaluated at c is greater than or equal to f of x for all x in your domain d and then we say that the absolute minimum value of the function f on the domain d or is if we have f of c is less than or equal to f of x for all x in d and so let's take a look at an example let's say we have a graph and our domain is just going to be something like this and that's all we're dealing with well what is the absolute maximum value this is because there is no value an f of x value that's higher than that and then this would be the absolute minimum value because there is no value that's lower than that and so if we said like this was the point c maybe this is the point d then f of c is greater than or equal to f of x for every x that falls in this domain and similarly we would say f of d is less than or equal to f of x for every x in the domain and that's where this curve is our function f of x we have another definition and this definition begins with the number f of c is one of the two following things a local maxima or maximum value if the if we have the following so this local maximum value of our function f if f of c is greater than or equal to f of x when x is near c and then we have the second definition that this says that it's a local minimum value of our function f if of c is less than or equal to f of x when x is near the point c so what i mean by that is the following so if we have our function and let's say we're still our domain and we look to be something like this now this point right here is the absolute minimum because there's nothing else that's lower than that but this point right here is a local minimum because if we're near that value so we're near in terms of x direction it's the lowest point near it so this is a this is a local minimum this point up here is the absolute maximum there's nothing else higher than that but this is a local maximum and this is also a local maximum because if you go near that anywhere near here there's nothing else greater than that yes if we pick the point over here there is something greater it's right here if you pick the point right here it's something greater so none of those points are local maximums now we have a theorem and this theorem expression it has a name and this is called the extreme value theorem the extreme value theorem states the following if our function f is going to be continuous on a closed interval and this interval would be from the point a to b then the function f attains an absolute max value and we'll call that f of c and an absolute minimum value and we'll call that point f of d at some numbers c and d in the interval from a to b so where c and d are in the interval a to b so let's take a look at a couple of examples y equals x squared well that's a parabola and so that we know that the domain is going to be from negative infinity to positive infinity and so the absolute maxima is going to be none because that's a parabola that goes all the way up like this so so the absolute max there's going to be none and the absolute min well there is an absolute min and that's going to be uh the absolute minimum value so if you look if we're asking for the value that's the y value it would be zero and this is at x equals zero now if we're still looking at the function y equals x squared but our domain is not negative infinity to positive infinity we're going to look at just from the point 0 to 2. so really if we're looking at at this curve it maybe is at some point from here to here so we're looking at just that curve then it does have a maximum value and the maximum value is going to be right at the top when x is 2. okay so the max the absolute max is when x equals two and if you plug in two into your function two squared is going to be four so the absolute maximum value is four and the absolute absolute minimum will still stay zero and this is at x is zero and this is because of the extreme value theorem since we had a closed interval and f of x equals x squared that's continuous but if we weren't continuing or if we weren't on a closed interval and let's say we looked at some interval from 0 to 2 we include the point 2 but we don't include the end point 0 then what happens is the following well 2 we still have the maximum at 2 because we included the value 2. so the maximum is 4 and that's when x is 2 but 0 is not included so what's the lowest value we can get we can start looking when x is say 0.1 we can get closer to 0 when x is 0.01 we can still get closer and x is 0.001 and so forth so it can get so close but there is no exact value where we get the smallest so in this case there's no absolute minimum now we have a theorem called ferma's theorem and fermat's theorem states that if f has a local maximum or minimum at some point c and if the derivative of f at c so f prime of c exists then the derivative f prime of c is equal to zero now i'm not going to prove it but if you think about it it can sort of make sense taking a look at a curve something like that a curve like this well this for this point right here is a local maximum what's the slope at that maximum well over here the slope is positive and then this is also a positive down here the slope is negative the slope is negative except to go from a positive to a negative slope right here at that maximum value the slope is zero and so the slope meaning the derivative of that function is zero and same thing for the minimum we're going to add a negative slope we have a negative slope and right at the minimum the slope is zero so that's where we get this f prime at c is equal to zero so an example might be if we have the function g of x is equal to three x squared plus 4 x plus 9 find the local maxima and minima well in order to do that we'll take the derivative g prime of x and this is going to be six x plus four and we want to find when the derivative is equal to zero and so now we solve so we get six x is equal to negative four or x is negative four over six which is negative two thirds now that's the x value and make sure when you're trying to find the local max or min you want to find the y value so we plug it back in g of negative two thirds is equal to three times negative two thirds squared plus four times negative twothirds plus nine so this is going to be three times fourninths plus negative thirds plus nine and this simplifies to four thirds minus eight thirds plus 27 thirds which is equal to 23 thirds next we have a definition this definition states that a critical number of a function f is a number c that's in the domain of f such that either the derivative f prime at c is equal to zero or f prime at c does not exist so if the derivative is 0 meaning it's going to be a local maximum or a local minimum or if the derivative does not exist that's a critical number so let's do an example find the critical points for the function h of x is equal to x to the two thirds critical points when the derivative is zero or the derivative doesn't exist so let's calculate the derivative that is twothirds x to the negative onethird or this is going to be two over three times the cube root of x now the cube root can be negative because you could take for example the cube root of negative 27 and that would be negative 3 because negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3 is negative 27. so that's fine but we have something in the denominator and so we cannot have zero in the denominator and so we know that if x were zero then we'd be dividing by zero and so zero is our critical point because h prime of 0 does not exist so our answer x equals 0 is a critical point now the last thing we're going to cover in this section is called the closed interval method the close interval interval method says to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function f on a closed interval from a to b then we look at three steps first find the values of f at the critical points or the critical numbers of f in the open interval a to b then step two find the values of f at the endpoints of the interval and then the last step step three then you take the largest value of the values from steps one and two so and that's going to be the absolute maximum and finally the smallest of the values is the minimum or the absolute minimum the smallest of the values is the absolute minimum and so these are the steps to find the absolute max in the absolute min so we'll do one example and find the absolute max and min so find the absolute maximum and we'll just say the values meaning the y value of our function f of x equals eight x minus x to the four on the closed interval negative two to one so what do we do we first take the derivative f prime of x equals eight minus 4x cubed we want to find the critical number so we want to find when this is 0 or undefined well this is going to be defined everywhere so we'll just find out when it's 0. if we add 4x cubed to both sides we get 8 is equal to 4x cubed or 2 is equal to x cubed and so therefore taking the cube root we get that x is equal to the cube root of two and substituting in we get our y value f of the cube root of 2 is equal to 8 times the cube root of 2 minus cube root of 2 to the power 4. and plugging this on the calculator this is about 7.56 now we need to check the end points and so we're checking the end points f at negative two and f at one well f at negative two is going to be eight times negative two minus negative two to the fourth and that's going to be negative 32 and f at 1 is going to be 8 times 1 minus 1 to the 4th which is seven so what we have here is that this is the minimum value so this is the absolute minimum now the absolute maximum this was a little trick or a trick question rather 7.56 is greater than 7 but remember we said that our interval had a maximum value of one what is the cube root of two well the cube root of two is a little bit greater than one it's about 1.26 so even though this y value is greater than here the x value didn't fall in our our domain and so our absolute maximum was at 7. so when you do problems make sure that your answer falls within the domain today we're going to talk about the mean value theorem we'll begin with the theorem and this theorem is called rolls theorem rose theorem says the following let f be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses the first one says that f is continuous on the closed interval a to b the second criteria says that f is differentiable on the open interval a to b and then the third criteria states that f of a equals f of b if all three of these things are met then we can conclude there is a number c that's in the interval a to b so c falls between a and b but not on the endpoints such that f prime of c is zero meaning the derivative of f at the point c is equal to zero so what is this saying let's take a look at some examples so if we have our function and we have the point a and the point b and our function f is a horizontal line f of a equals f of b it's differentiable in this function and continuous then there's some point in the middle let's say right here c where f prime of c is uh zero meaning the derivative is zero so has a slope of zero and that's true because this is a horizontal line we could have another case that looks like the following let's say we have the point a over here b over here and our graph looks something like that this is continuous this is differentiable and f of a equals f of b but this point right up here is horizontal or it has a slope of zero f prime of c so our c would be right there is zero there's other cases that we might look at and those cases might look something like here the point a the point b we might have f of a f of b looks like that might have something like this now we'll have multiple places where we have f prime at c is zero so we could have this could be our c1 and that could be our c2 but all we're saying is that there exists at least one point c and then finally we could just have for a and b it would look like oh i just did that it would let me it would look the other way and so we have that one so let's do an example show that the equation x cubed plus three x plus one equals zero has exactly one real solution so if we call this our function f of x notice that f of negative one is going to be negative one cubed plus three times negative one plus 1 which is negative 3 and f of 0 well that's just going to be 1. so we know we're crossing from negative to positive and the intermediate value theorem says that if you have something that's going to be negative and then it's going to be positive and it's a continuous function which this is since it's a polynomial it has to cross the axis now i could cross multiple times but now we're trying to show that it crosses just once now if it did cross more than once we might have something where it would look like this it crosses one time crosses two times and then it goes back up maybe even three times but roll's theorem would say that if this were to happen where we have these two values are equal then we would have to have the derivative at some point is going to be zero so let's calculate the derivative the derivative is gonna be f prime of x is three x squared plus three but notice this can never be zero this is always going to be greater than zero because x squared is always a positive number and if you add 3 to a positive number it's always going to be positive so there's never going to be the point when it's equal to 0 which means that we can't have we can't satisfy rolls theorem and thus we only have one zero now the main point of roll's theorem is so that we can actually use it for the mean value theorem now we go to the mean value theorem the mean value theorem states the following let f be a function that satisfies the following one f is continuous on the closed interval a to b two f is differentiable on the open interval a to b if these two hypotheses are met then there is a number c that's in the interval a to b such that f of f prime of c is equal to f of b minus f of a divided by b minus a or we could write this equivalently as follows if we multiplied out we could have written it as f of b minus f of a is equal to the derivative f prime of c times the quantity b minus a so now in order to think about this what is the derivative well the derivative is basically the slope which is the rise over the run so what we have is that if we have some point a and maybe some point b where it's not necessarily a and to get from a to b connecting the slope from a to b we have a line that looks like this with that slope somewhere on this curve we right here the derivative is not the same not right here but maybe somewhere right there we have a derivative where the slope is going to be the same we might also it might have something else say we have some point a over here some point b up there and the graph looks something like this connecting these two points that's our slope maybe we'll have a point right here as well as a point right here so let's do an example using the mean value theorem take a look at the function f of x equals x squared now we know this is a parabola and parabola looks something like this it crosses at the origin at the point one it's at one at two it's one two three it's two squared it would be four let's take a look at the interval from zero to two it's continuous from zero to two it's differentiable on the open interval zero to two so the mean value theorem says that there's some point c such that f prime of c is equal to f of 2 minus f of 0 divided by 2 minus 0. well f of 2 is 2 squared so 4 minus 0 squared or 0 over 2 minus 0. so this is going to be 2. so we need to find that point c that exists well what's the derivative first of all what's f prime of x that would be 2x and so if we wanted f prime of c to be equal to two then we get that c is equal to one and we know that one is in this interval between zero and two and so looking just at this graph where the line looks like that the slope right here at 1 1 should also be that same slope now let's do a different type of example let's suppose that if a car accelerating from zero takes eight seconds to go 352 feet its average velocity for the 8 second interval is going to be the distance 352 feet divided by 8 seconds and the units would be feet per second so this is 44 feet per second the mean value theorem which i'm just going to abbreviate with its initials mvt says that at some point during the acceleration the speedometer must read exactly 44 feet per second or 30 miles per hour or 44 feet per second and that sort of makes sense if you're accelerating you have to pass that certain point now we have a theorem and this theorem states the following if the derivative f prime of x equals zero for all x in an interval a to b then f is constant on that interval a to b if the derivative is 0 for all that value it's just the horizontal line that's all this is saying finally we have a corollary the corollary states the following if f prime of x is equal to g prime of x for all x in an interval a to b then f minus g is constant on that interval a to b in other words that is f of x equals f of g plus some value c where c is a constant today we're going to look at how the derivatives affect the shape of a graph the first thing we'll look at is an increasing and decreasing test this test says that a if our derivative f prime of x is greater than zero on an interval then our function f is increasing on that interval and then b that if the derivative f prime of x is less than zero on an interval then f is decreasing on that interval and so let's take a moment and think about this if the derivative is greater than zero that derivative is the slope and if the slope is positive it's increasing if the slope is negative it's decreasing so let's do an example if we're given the function f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x minus five identify the open intervals in which this function is increasing and the intervals in which it's decreasing okay so we want to find increasing and the intervals where it's decreasing if we have a function that say goes up it increases and then it starts to decrease that point where it changes that's one of our critical points so let's first find the critical points because then that will tell us where all these different intervals are we take the derivative f prime of x so we get 3 x squared minus 12. that's our derivative to find the critical points we set the derivative equal to zero so we get three x squared minus twelve equals zero solving for x we get three x squared equals twelve x squared equals four or x is equal to plus or minus two so we have two critical points at negative two and at two so if we broke up and then looked at this on a number line we'd have negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 3 and so forth off to positive and negative infinity so we know we have a critical point at negative 2 and a critical point at positive 2. and since there aren't any other critical points if we're on this side we're either all decreasing or all increasing and in this interval all increasing are all decreasing because if you're to increase and then decrease again going up to go down you must have a local max or a local min so we're all going to be the same in each of these intervals so we have the intervals negative infinity to negative 2. negative 2 to 2 and then 2 to infinity now we need to figure out if we're increasing or decreasing and that is simply just plugging a number in each of these intervals into the derivative and seeing if that derivative is positive or negative so here let's pick the point for this first interval let's pick the point negative three so we'll pick f prime of negative three so that's three times negative three squared minus twelve and that ends up being 15. so that's greater than zero so in this interval right here we are increasing and then we'll pick a point in the middle between negative two and two and so let's say zero so f prime is zero and so that is just negative 12 which we know is negative so that's decreasing and finally we pick a point between 2 and infinity and let's just say f prime of 3 you could pick any point you want you could pick f prime of 10 but f prime of 3 is what i'm going to go with so we get 3 times 3 square minus 12 and we get 15 again which is positive so it's increasing in that interval so to write out our final answer what we would say would be on the interval let's say negative infinity to negative two it's going to be increasing the interval negative two to two it would be decreasing and then finally on the interval 2 to infinity you would be increasing again the next thing we'll look at is something called the first derivative test and what this says is suppose that c is a critical number of a continuous function f then the first thing a says that if f prime changes from positive to negative at the point c then f has a local maximum at c the second thing says that if f prime changes from negative to positive at the point c then f has a local minimum at c and so what these are saying is that if we're going from positive to negative then we have a maximum if we go from going down to a negative slope to a positive slope we have a minimum and then finally c the third thing says that if f prime is positive to the left and to the right of c or if it's negative to the left and right of c then f has no local maximum or minimum at c so if the slope is both is positive on both sides of c or negative on both sides of c then it's not a maximum or a minimum so let's do an example find the critical points of f of x equals x to the one third power times x minus four now we could use the product rule or what we could do is just multiply this out and this would be x to the four thirds power minus four x to the one third power now in addition to finding the critical points let's also identify the intervals which f is increasing and decreasing and find the functions local and absolute extreme values meaning the maximum and minimum so the derivative f prime of x is going to be four thirds x to the one third power minus another four thirds x to the negative two power or two thirds power and i got this four thirds by multiplying four times one third so to find the critical points we set the derivative equal to zero we set that equal to zero and so now solving for this we can get rid of the four thirds by let's say dividing everything by four thirds and so we get x to the one third power minus x to the negative two thirds power equals zero now to solve this what we're gonna do is we're gonna factor out an x to the negative twothirds so if we factored out x to the negative twothirds from x to the onethird what we would get would just be x because x to the one times x to the negative two thirds is x to the one third minus one equals zero so this is x minus one over x to the two thirds equals zero so now solving for x we get x is equal to one that's the zeros but also note that we have an x in the denominator and so that means that x equals 0 is a critical point because a critical number is when the derivative is 0 or the derivative does not exist so these are our two critical numbers so now we're gonna go ahead and make some space and we're gonna draw the number line and that number line so our numbers are 0 and 1. so we'll start with the point less than that at negative 1 0 1 and we'll go ahead one more to 2. remember our derivative f prime of x is equal to four thirds times x to the one third power minus four thirds x to the negative two thirds power and we're going to have three intervals the first interval is going to be from negative infinity to zero the second interval will be from 0 to 1 and then the third will be from 1 to infinity so for this first interval we'll pick a point in that interval let's say negative 1. so we'll check out f prime of negative one and so we get four thirds times negative one to the one third minus four thirds times negative one to the negative two thirds we get negative eightthirds which is negative so on this interval right here we have since it's negative it's decreasing and then we'll pick a point between zero and one let's just say f prime of 0.5 if we were to plug that in we get that that is also going to be negative so this is less than zero and since it's less than zero it's still decreasing so just because we have a critical point that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a max or minute or that it changes signs and then finally we'll pick a point in the interval from one to infinity how about two if we're to plug this in on a calculator we get that that is greater than zero so it's increasing so here we have the intervals where it's increasing and decreasing and we have a local max or min when it changes from increasing and decreasing so right here where it changes from decreasing to increasing we get that one is a local it's going to be a max or min so if you go from going down going up we have a local minimum so we have the local minimum at x equals one and so the value of that plugging in f of 1 what we get is f of 1 is negative 3. so that's that's the value of the local minimum so we've looked at what hap what the first derivative tells us now we'll take a look at what the second derivative tells us but first we'll begin with the definition and this definition states that if the graph of f lies above all of its tangents on an interval let's call this interval i then you see it's called concave upward on that interval i and then similarly if the graph of f lies below all of its tangents on an interval i then it is called concave downward on that interval i so what does that even mean so let's take a look if it's concave up so if we have a graph that looks like this and this is our graph f where all the tangent lines the tangent line goes this way tangent line goes this way tangent goes this way and this way and so forth and each of those tangents f is going to be above the tangents now if we have a graph that goes like this let's call this graph g we'll have a tangent that goes like this tangent that goes like this tangent that goes like this and in each of these cases g our function is going to be below the tangents and so this first one this is concave up and this is concave down so now we know what the definition of concavity is let's actually figure out how we test for it so the concavity test goes as follows we're gonna first a if you take the second derivative f double prime of x and if that derivative is greater than zero for all x in that interval i then the graph of f is concave upward on your interval i and then b if the second derivative of f is less than zero for all x in the interval i then the graph of f is concave downward on that interval i so let's do an example if we have the curve y equals x cubed now that graph you may be familiar with that the cubic function looks something like this so let's figure out when it's concave up and concave down so if we call this our function f of x first thing we do is take the first derivative f prime of x so we get 3 x squared and then we take the second derivative f double prime of x and so we get 6 x we want to find when this derivative the second derivative is going to be positive or negative well we know that this derivative is going to be positive when x is going to be from 0 to infinity as long as x is positive the second derivative is positive your second derivative is negative when x is between negative infinity and zero so it's going to be concave up so that tells us this concave up concave up from zero to infinity concave down from negative infinity to zero so taking a look at here from zero to infinity we see it does have that upward motion or the upward appearance and then we have that concave down from zero to negative infinity we'll do another brief example and this is the curve f of x equals x squared we know this is the parabola so we take the first derivative f prime of x is 2x and the second derivative is just going to be 2. well we know 2 is always greater than 0. if that's always greater than 0 then this curve is always concave up meaning it's concave up from the interval negative infinity to infinity and take a look at this this is always going to be concave upwards now we have another definition what this definition states is a point p on a curve y is equal to f of x is called an inflection point if f is continuous there so at that point and the curve changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa so or changes from concave down to concave up so as long as the concavity is changing then we have an inflection point so now if you recall from the example that we had just done where we had y is equal to x cubed at 0 the graph of this it went like that and went like this in this region it was concave in this region it was concave down and so that point where it changes from concave up to concave down that is the inflection point right here where it changes from concave up to concave down so you can kind of see it right there drawn on the graph and finally today we're going to talk about the second derivative test the second derivative test states the following suppose f double prime of x so the second derivative is continuous near the point c then we have two things if f prime of c is zero so if the first derivative is zero meaning it's a critical point and the second derivative at the point c is greater than zero so meaning it's concave up then f has a local minimum at the point c and then b if f prime of c is zero and f double prime of c is less than zero then f has a local maximum at c so what does this represent if we were to have a curve and say we have a curve that looks like this f prime at c is zero so the derivative is zero so we these two points we have derivatives and the derivatives are zero now we look at the second derivative is it concave up or concave down well right here it's concave down so if it's concave down then it has a maximum right here it's concave up so if it's concave up meaning second derivative is positive then it's a minimum and also you can notice you may notice about right here the concavity switches that's the inflection point it goes from downward to upward and finally if the second derivative is equal to zero well then this test doesn't really tell us anything it could be a local max it could be a local min or it could be neither so we don't really know so let's do an example f of x is equal to x to the 4 minus four x cubed plus ten we'll take the first and second derivative first derivative we get four x cubed minus twelve x squared the second derivative is 12x squared minus 24 x to find the critical points we want to set the first derivative equal to zero so we have four x cubed minus twelve x squared equals to zero we can factor out four x squared and we're left with x minus three equals zero so we have critical points are x equals 0 and x equals 3. plugging these two points in into our second derivative we get f double prime of x we'll put in the first point zero so f double prime of zero is just going to be zero well that doesn't really tell us anything that's all right we plug the second point f double prime of 3 in and then what we get is we get 12 times 3 squared minus 24 times 3 we get 36 which is positive so if the second derivative is greater than zero meaning it's concave upward so we have something like concave upward that means it's a minimum so x equals three is at the minimum today we're going to talk about the limits at infinity as well as the horizontal asymptotes so we begin with an intuitive definition of a limit at infinity let f be a function defined on some interval let's call this interval a to infinity then the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x equals l means that the values of f of x can but may be made arbitrarily close to the value of l by requiring x to be sufficiently large now another notation for this you might see instead of the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x equals l you might also see f of x goes to l as x goes to infinity now what this all means is essentially if we have some curve let's say that's our xaxis and our yaxis and let this be the line y equals l we may have the graph do something like this but eventually it'll get very very close to l so this is an example as x goes to infinity your function f of x so this is y equals f of x is l you might see something else you might see something like again where this is l the function might look like that or even something that oscillates so we might have something where this is so this is our x y and that's the line l we might have something that does this but it does get closer and closer and closer to l next we have a definition this says that let f be a function defined on some interval negative negative infinity to a then we write the limit as x goes to negative infinity of f of x is equal to l and likewise this means that the values of f of x can be made arbitrarily close to l by requiring x to be sufficiently large in the negative sense and so what that could look like graphically would be we have x and y and this is the value l and our graph might come like that going towards l all the way negative now we have a third definition and this definition states the line y equals l is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve y equals f of x if either one the limit as x approaches infinity of f of x equals l or the limit as x approaches negative infinity of f of x is equal to l so we're going to do an example and our function f of x is equal to x cubed minus two divided by the absolute value of x cubed plus one the graph of this looks something like the following and so what we can see is that the limit as x goes to infinity of this function as it goes to infinity we approach one and the limit as x goes to negative infinity we approach a negative one now we have a theorem that says if r is greater than zero is a rational number than the following the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x to the r power is equal to zero and then we have if r is greater than zero and this is a rational number such that x to the r power is defined for all x then the limit as x goes to negative infinity of one over x to the r is equal to zero and so thinking about this for a moment this can make sense if we have x some uh x in the denominator and raised to very large power your denominator is getting very very large and one of our large numbers very small and so as this goes to infinity this goes towards zero and similarly in this case a negative number raised to a very a very large negative number raised to a power as x goes to infinity or negative infinity rather that also goes towards zero now let's do an example let's calculate the limit as x goes to infinity of the quantity 5x squared plus 8x minus 3 all over 3x squared plus 2. so what we're going to do here is we want to have our x on the denominator so for each term in here we're going to divide by x squared that's the largest power so this becomes the limit as x goes to infinity and we're going to divide every single term by x squared so 5 x squared divided by x squared plus 8x divided by x squared minus 3 over x squared all over 3x squared over x squared plus x squared excuse me plus 2 over x squared and then this will equal the limit as x goes to infinity of well 5 x squared over x squared is just going to be 5 plus 8 over x minus 3 over x squared all over 3 plus 2 over x squared now we can actually take the limit and of each of these individual components and so this is equivalent to the limit as x goes to infinity of 5 plus the limit as x goes to infinity of 8 over x minus the limit as x goes to infinity of 3 over x squared is all divided by the limit as x goes to infinity of 3 plus the limit as x goes to infinity of 2 over x squared and so now this is equal to this first limit well it's just a constant this right here is just going to be 5. now this according to the theorem that we have x is raised to the power 1 and so that's a positive power that means this is going towards as x goes to infinity this whole limit is going to be zero same thing for this and same thing for down here and this is just a constant so that's going to be three so this is going to be five plus zero plus zero divided by three plus zero and so your limit here is five thirds all right we'll do one more example and so let's compute the limit as x goes to infinity of the quantity x minus the square root of x squared plus 16. well what do we do here it may not be apparent at first but what we're going to do is multiply by the conjugate and we're going to multiply by the conjugate over itself so we get x squared plus 16 and then divided by x plus the square root of x squared plus 16. and so this becomes the limit as x goes to infinity of and the numerator becomes x squared minus and the square root times itself is just x squared plus 16 all over x plus the square root of x squared plus 16. and this simplifies the numerator simplifies our x squared will cancel and so this is the limit as x goes to infinity of negative 16 don't forget the negative divided by x plus the square root of x squared plus 16. and now the limit notice that this denominator is of some power x being positive and so this is just going to be zero and that's your limit now we're going to take a look at what happens if we have something like the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x and if this equals infinity so this is used to say that if our function f becomes large as x becomes large similarly we might we might also have the limit as x approaches negative infinity of f of x and that could be infinity or we could have the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x is negative infinity or the limit as x goes to negative infinity of f of x is negative infinity so an example of this might be if f of x is equal to x cubed we know x cubed is the function that looks something like this and so the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x or of x cubed is going to be positive infinity but the limit as x goes to negative infinity of x cubed looking at the graph that goes to negative infinity now we'll do another example right here and if we have the limit as x goes to infinity of the quantity x squared minus x if you if we were to use the law of limits and i'm actually going to show you the wrong way so i'm going to write it in red the wrong way of doing this would be using the law of limits and so this is the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared minus the limit as x goes to infinity of x and so this is infinity minus infinity we cannot do this because infinity is not a number there's no number infinity you can't take infinity divided by two for example so this is wrong we don't do this what we can do is the following we can actually factor out an x so this is the limit as x goes to infinity of the quantity x times x minus one and now because we're multiplying two things this infin this limit is going to be infinity both of these terms x and x minus one as x gets larger they both become arbitrarily large and so therefore their product also becomes large today we're going to talk about a summary of all the ways that we can sketch curves the first thing we can do is look at the domain okay the domain is all the possible x values that we use the second thing is to look at the intercepts and they they include both the x and the yintercept to find the xintercept that's when it crosses the xaxis you set y equal to zero and to find the yintercept you set x equal to zero the next thing we do is you check for symmetry looking for symmetry we want to see if f of negative x equals f of x if that's the case then the function is going to be even an even function is when it's symmetric about the yaxis for example you might have something that looks like this and then it symmetric like that and so this is really if f of negative x equals f of x and then we check if f of negative x equals negative f of x in this case this would give us an odd function an odd function the graph of an odd function looks like uh reflected over the xaxis and then reflected reflected again over the yaxis like that and the third type of symmetry we might get is a periodic function that is if we have f of x plus p is equal to f of x for some positive constant p right that's where we have our period for example trig functions the graph of y cosine of x repeats forever it's periodic and now i'm going to move up a little bit the next thing we're going to look at is asymptotes so d would be asymptotes we have different types of asymptotes the first one we'll discuss is horizontal asymptotes horizontal asymptotes are found usually when we take the limit as x approaches infinity of f of x if that limit is some l or if we take the limit as x approaches negative infinity of f of x and it equals some value l then that implies the line y equals l is a horizontal asymptote the next type of asymptote we have would be the vertical asymptote and the vertical asymptote is if we're taking the limit as x approaches some value a from say the right of f of x if that equals infinity or if the limit as x approaches a from the right of f of x is negative infinity or the limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x is infinity or the limit as x approaches a from the left of f of x is negative infinity so any one of these if the limit is going to be infinity as we approach a number from the left or right then that means that the line so in this case we had the line y equals l is horizontal asymptote we get x equals a is the vertical asymptote there's another type of asymptote that we have and this is called a slant asymptote another name for slant asymptote is an oblique asymptote but we'll discuss this another time now the next thing that we look for would be e we're going to look at the intervals of increase or decrease and this is where we take the derivative we find f prime and if f prime of x is positive it's increasing and if the derivative f prime of x is negative then we're decreasing then step f you look for the local maximum and minimum values to do this first we find all the values of f that are critical numbers okay and if you recall critical numbers are when the derivative f prime of x equals zero or when the derivative f prime of x does not exist and then to determine if it's a local max or a local minimum you take the first derivative test and if your function is increasing before the critical number and then decreasing afterwards so if it's increasing before and then decreasing after we have a local max or if it's decreasing and then increasing we have a local min and then step g you check out the concavity and points of inflection so concavity and the points of inflection we're going to take a look at the second derivative f double prime of x if your second derivative is greater than zero then it's if it's greater than zero then it's going to be concave up if the second derivative is less than zero is concave down when it changes concavity so going from concave up to concave down or from concave down to concave up that's our inflection point and then the last thing h now that we have all this information we sketch the curve so now let's do an example using all the steps that we have sketch the curve y is equal to x squared divided by x squared minus one so following our steps step a what's the domain well the domain is all real numbers and in fact i'll write it as all real numbers except for one or negative one i'll write it in interval notation negative infinity to negative one negative one to one and then 1 to infinity okay now step b next we find our intercepts and so for the intercept to find the y intercept we set x equal to zero and if x is zero well y is also zero so we get uh zero comma zero and then to get the x intercept well for the xintercept we'd set y equal to zero and in this case the x and yintercept is the same it's zero zero now we could check for cement uh symmetry in this case if we put negative x into f of x we get 2 times negative x quantity squared divided by negative x quantity squared minus 1. negative x quantity squared is just x squared so this is 2 x squared divided by x squared minus 1 which is our original function this was f of x so this is telling us that the f that this function is even next we'll check for the asymptotes we'll check for vertical and horizontal asymptotes to check for the horizontal asymptote we're going to take the limit as x goes to plus or minus infinity of our function 2x squared divided by x squared minus 1. if we took this and we divided both the numerator and denominator by x squared what we get is just 2 in the numerator and on the denominator dividing by x squared well x squared divided by x squared is 1 and then 1 divided by x squared is just going to be 1 over x squared so this is 1 minus 1 over x squared and now you can see as x goes to infinity this goes to 0 and so we're left with 2 over 1 or just 2. so that tells us we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals two to find the vertical asymptotes notice that the denominator is zero when x is plus or minus one and this is also coming from our domain where x couldn't be negative or positive one and so if we looked at the limit we get the limit as x approaches one let's say from the right side of our function two x squared divided by x squared minus one well this is going to be infinity and then if we also took the limit as x approaches 1 from the left side of two x squared over x squared minus one this is negative infinity so this tells us we have a vertical asymptote at x equals one and similarly if we went for negative 1 we get the limit as x goes to negative 1 from the right of 2x squared over x squared minus 1 that's also going to be infinity excuse me it should be a negative infinity rather and then this limit as x goes to negative one from the left of two x squared over x squared minus one that's positive infinity so we have a second vertical asymptote at negative 1. all right we're almost there bear with me e well let's first take the derivative f prime of x and here we're going to have to use the quotient rule okay so the denominator x squared minus 1 times the derivative of the numerator 4x minus the numerator 2x squared times the derivative of the denominator times 2x divided by the denominator squared this actually simplifies to negative 4x over x squared minus 1 quantity squared now since the denominator is always going to be positive because it's squared we can just look at the numerator when is this this derivative positive and what is this derivative negative well f prime of x is going to be positive when x is less than zero that means when x is less than zero it'll be increasing and f prime of x is negative when x is greater than zero and so that's where we're going to be decreasing of course keep in mind that x can't be one or negative one because it's not in the domain now we're going to find f which is our local max and minimum values so we have our derivative over here that will tell us our critical points the critical points are when the derivative is zero so that first one the numerator is zero when x is zero so that's the first critical point and the critical point is also occurs when the derivative is not defined so when our denominator is zero our denominator is zero of the derivative the derivative when x is one or when x is negative one plugging in all these we get f of zero f of one and f of negative one f of zero is zero f of one and f of negative one is undefined so they're not a local max or a local min because it's not even in the domain so we have just f f of zero equals zero now this could be a local max or a local min and so we need to determine which one it is now we can use the first derivative test so we'll pick a point just to the left of it we'll pick a point let's say let's say 0.5 or negative 0.5 so from the number line we're at negative 0.5 0 and then 0.5 putting these points into our derivative f prime of x or rather f prime of negative 0.5 so the derivative at negative 0.5 and the derivative at 0.5 and we're going to determine if the derivative goes from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing this gives us something like approximately 3.556 and negative 3.556 and so if we're going before our derivative is going to be positive and then after zero our derivative is negative so since we're changing this tells us that we have a local maximum so this is a local max and the very last thing last step that we got to do is take the derivative of the derivative or the second derivative and if you recall so our first derivative f prime of x was equal to negative 4x over x squared minus one quantity squared determining contact concavity we need to have the second derivative and so here we go we're going to take the denominator which is going to be x squared minus 1 squared times the derivative of the numerator times negative 4 minus the numerator so minus a negative 4 is a plus 4x times the derivative of the denominator and this is where it's going to get pretty ugly so we're going to have to use the chain rule derivative of the denominator is going to be 2 times the quantity x squared minus 1 squared times the derivative of the inside 2x all over the denominator which is x squared minus 1 quantity squared squared so if you have a squared squared it'd be raised to the fourth power now all this simplifies and thankfully it simplifies and what we end up with is the following we end up with 12x squared plus 4 divided by x squared minus 1 cubed oops and i just realized this should be to the power one now if we're determining concavity if it's concave up or concave down notice the numerator this is always going to be positive because x squared is positive 12 times the positive number is positive and if you add four so this is always going to be positive so we're only really concerned about this denominator this x squared minus one so we want to see x squared minus 1 when is x squared minus 1 going to be positive well x squared minus 1 is positive only if x is going to be uh greater than one or less than negative one so if x is greater than one or x is less than negative one it'll be concave up well it'll be positive this is positive which means this is positive which means the second derivative is positive so it's concave up for there and this is a less than and not a two so that's where it's concave up and when x is between negative one and one it's concave down all right now we're going to have to try and put all this together into a graph so i have everything right here so let's see what we got going through the steps so we have right here x cannot be one or negative one we have an intercept right here at zero zero zero the origin looking at c it's going to be an even function so we only need to draw half of it and the other half would be reflected now we have part d these are telling us right here these are telling us all the limits and that gives us a horizontal asymptote of two these limits give us a vertical asymptote at negative one and positive one but taking a look at these limits a little bit a little bit more careful what we get is the following we get as we go to negative infinity the limit is 2 so as we go to negative infinity we're going to be at 2 and as we go to positive infinity we're also going to be at 2. and then we look at the vertical asymptote these vertical asymptotes say as we approach so i'm just going to look at the negative 1 right now so if we approach negative 1 from the left side it's going to be infinity so as we approach negative 1 from the left side it'll be infinity and we're going towards two so we can sort of fill in our gap like that knowing that this is an even function we would get the mirror image something to be like that and then the limit as x approaches negative 1 from the right side is negative infinity so we'd be down here negative infinity going upwards and we'd be going upwards because right here step e says we're increasing as long as we're as long as x is negative so we're increasing and we're going to keep increasing until we hit this local maximum 0 0. so we're going to keep increasing until we hit the local maximum local maximum means then it goes around it turns back heading downward and we can see taking a look at at a just a reflection we get something like that and we can verify the way that we drew it because as we draw these curves instead of the curve looking like something funky we know it's sort of smooth like this meaning it's concave down when we're between negative one and one and over here that's a concave up and that's also a concave up and that's how we draw our curves today we're going to talk about optimization problems there are a couple of steps to solving optimization problems the first thing is to read the problem read the problem and understand it second thing you want to do is draw a diagram okay so we're reading the problem we're asking ourselves what's the unknown what are we given what do we want to find those types of things we draw the diagram these up often help us with these types of problems and then the third thing introduce notation or variables for now let's say what we're trying to optimize trying to maximize or minimize let's call that q then step four what we want to do is we're going to express q in terms of some other symbol or whatever unknown quantity or other quantity that we have and we'll keep doing this until we only have just one variable so say q is just a function of x or something to that effect and after we do that the last step step five is to basically find the absolute maximum or minimum i didn't finish my five right there so step 5 would be find the absolute max or minimum and we'll use one one more test that will help us and this is the first derivative test for absolute extreme values meaning maximum and minimum and what this says is that suppose that c is a critical number of a continuous function f defined on an interval a says that if the derivative f prime of x is greater than zero for all x that's less than c and the derivative f prime of x is less than zero for all x greater than c then we conclude that f of c is the absolute maximum value and b well let's just back up for a minute so if the derivative is greater than zero so we're increasing for all some values and then the derivative is less than zero we're decreasing we have an absolute max and then if the derivative f prime of x is less than 0 for all x less than c and f prime of x is greater than 0 for all x greater than c then f c is the absolute minimum let's do an example so we have an open top box and it's made by cutting uh small squares out of the corners of a 12 by 12 inch tin okay so if we have a square like this and this 12 inches by 12 inches but we cut off the corners like this and then we fold these tabs upwards so we were to fold this tab up this tab up this tab up and this tab up what we would get would be a box where the tabs would go up like that tabs will go up and so forth the tabs that were once out here they get brought up like this and so we have our box so what we have is we have 12 inches by 12 inches and we cut we cut small squares out of the corners what i want to know is how small should these squares be so the box holds as much as possible in other words what we're trying to do is we're trying to maximize the volume of the box now we're trying to figure out what these squares we're cutting out of and so let's call these squares the length of these squares x and so let's try and and figure out the formula for the volume of this so what is the volume well if this whole length is 12 what is this length that's really just this smaller piece and we took a side x off and an x off so this new length is 12 minus 2x and so this whole square is going to be 12 minus 2x by 12 minus 2x and how high is this this height is going to be x so the equation for volume as a function of our x is going to be our height x times 12 minus 2x by 12 minus 2x or 12 minus 2x quantity squared and we can go ahead and write this all out we'll expand this so we get 144 minus 48 x plus 4 x squared or 144 x minus 48 x squared plus 4x cubed so we're trying to maximize this maximize the volume so let's go ahead and take the derivative and one thing to note before we take the derivative remember this whole thing has a length of 12. so if we have x and x keep in mind that we can't have a negative link so x can be at most six otherwise 12 minus 2x would be negative and you can't have a negative side so taking the derivative dv dx we get 144 minus 96 x plus 12 x squared if we want to maximize this we're going to set this equal to zero and find the critical points so we'll set this equal to zero and what do we get well we can factor out 12 so we get 12 times the quantity 12 minus 8x plus x squared equals zero we can factor this one more time so this is 12 times the quantity 2 minus x times 6 minus x equals 0 and so therefore our critical points are x equals 2 and x equals six but remember if x equals six then we wouldn't have any length so we can go ahead and disregard this one point so x equals two is how much we'll have to cut off from each side two inches now these optimization problems have a lot of application in business and economics so in these types of problems you might say define some r of x to be the revenue you might say c of x would be the cost and then p of x would be your profit and so we'd say p of x would be the revenue which you make minus the cost and if you want to maximize your profit then you find this function and take its derivative now for the in economics the derivative of r economists tend to use the term marginal revenue marginal cost for the derivative of the cost and marginal profit for the derivative of the profit today we're going to talk about newton's method the goal of newton's method for estimating a solution for an equation is to provide a sequence of approximations that approach the actual solution this is what goes on inside a computer or calculator when it tries to find the solution to an equation in newton's method we wish to solve some sort of equation f of x equals zero and so if we're to graph something like this let's just say our function if it's x and y this is our function f of x right here and we want to find when it's zero so basically the xintercept what we do with newton's method is we begin by just picking some point on this curve and so let's say this point is the point x1 comma and then our y value would be f of x1 so this is the point x1 right here that's straight down and we're trying to find this point right here let's just call that point r now if we consider the tangent line to this curve at x1 that tangent line looks something like this the tangent line will cross down and we'll say that point will be x2 okay so the tangent line of uh at this curve call this l1 and it crosses the axis at x2 or just l to find the formula for the for the tangent line l we use the equation y minus our y one value and so this is our this is our points that we're using so the y one value is really f of x1 is equal to the slope so we're using the formula y minus y1 equals m times x minus x1 where our slope is really our derivative so that's f prime at the point x1 times x minus x1 so this is the equation of that line but we know that line when it crosses right here at that point that's at the point x two comma zero that's at the point x two comma zero so we can plug x two comma zero into this equation so what we get is zero minus f of x1 so we're plugging in x2 in for x and 0 in for y so this is 0 minus f of x1 equals f prime of x1 times x2 minus x1 and doing some rearranging of terms we can solve for x2 and we get that x2 is going to be x1 minus f of x1 divided by f prime of x1 so now given just some initial point that we picked on this graph f of x we can now get this point x two and notice this point x two is going to be closer than our original x1 is to where it crosses the axis now let's go ahead and draw another diagram i'm going to make this one maybe a little bit bigger so we had our point this is the point x1 comma f of x1 this is x1 right here that's r over x and y this is the graph of f of x we found the tangent line right here tangent line crossed at this point this is our point x two so now if we move x two up to the line we have another point x 2 comma f of x 2 and we'll do the same thing we'll find the tangent line right there and it crosses and we'll get another point x3 each time we're getting closer and closer and then from x3 we'll move up find that and then they'll get closer and closer and closer so what would x3 be well using the exact same method we did we would have found out that x3 was equal to x2 minus f of x two divided by f prime of x two so this leads us to the formula for newton's method if we have that the derivative does not equal to zero we can find the nth approximation so this one right here would be the second approximation the one that we did above to find x2 would have been the first approximation and so to find the nth approximation what we would do is we assume that f prime of x sub n is not equal to zero then we're given and i'll go ahead and change my marker for this we're given that x to the n plus one is equal to x to the n minus f of x to the n over f prime of x to the n this is newton's approximation and we can do this to help us approximate our zeros and if we do it more and more we'll get closer and closer and closer towards r we started off way out here at x1 then we moved our x2 got a little bit closer x3 will get closer and we can get on and on and on so let's do an example so if we wanted to find an approximation for the square root of 2 what we would have to do would be to approximate the zero of f of x is equal to x squared minus two so if we wanted to find when this is equal to zero you could see manipulating this we found we would find that x is equal to zero or x sorry is equal to the square root of two so this is the function we're going to deal with we need one piece of information and that's the derivative so f prime of x and this is equal to 2x so now newton's method will say that x to the n plus or x sub n plus 1 is equal to x sub n minus our f of x which is x squared minus 2 but remember we're dealing with x sub n instead of just x so this is x of n squared minus 2 over the derivative 2x or 2 x sub n now i'm going to go ahead and just simplify this i'm gonna break up this fraction into two fractions so we're gonna get x sub n squared over two x sub n and now we're doing a minus a minus 2 so minus a minus gives us a plus 2 over 2 2 sub x n and this simplifies we get x sub n minus here our x and cancel so we get x n over 2 plus and then our twos cancel one over x sub n and we can combine the first two terms one minus a half is just a half so x sub n over 2 plus 1 over x sub n this is our approximation that we'll be using in this example now we do know because we have calculators what the exact value or a good approximation of the square root of 2 is and so if we were to calculate square root of 2 to 5 decimal places we get the square root of 2 is equal to 1.1 uh 1.41421 okay so we're gonna have this and now let's start computing it'd be nice if we kind of knew where to begin and we can sort of figure out that the square root of 2 is going to be between 1 and 2 because we know that the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 1 is 1. so we know this the square root of 2 is between the square root of one and the square root of four so we know the square root of two is between one and two so we'll have to pick some number at least that gives us a ballpark area we're not picking the square root of two is approximately a hundred so let's start off with x sub one is equal to our x sub zero our very first thing is equal to one then plugging it in what do we get into this equation so plugging this in we get into our formula x sub 1 which is x0 over two plus one over x zero which is one half plus one over one we get one point five and then for the next term x of 1 well x sub 1 we found is 1.5 so we get x sub 2 is going to be x1 over 2 plus 1 over x sub 1 which is 1.5 over 2 plus 1 over 1.5 and this gets 1.4166 uh repeating forever and we'll call this 6 6 7. and then we'll do x sub 3 would be x sub 2 over 2 plus 1 over x sub 2 which is equal to six 1.41667 over two plus one over one point four one six six seven and this would give us one point four one four two 2. so we only did a couple of calculations right we started when x is 0 when x is going to be 1 then we got 1.5 1.41667 and we got 1.41422 remember the square root of 2 is 1.41421 and so we could take a look at the error that we had and so if our value for x0 is 1 x1 is 1.5 x2 is 1.41667 and x3 is 1.414 the error we get is going to be the first one we're off by 0.41421 and this is negative then the next error we got .08579 we're getting better and then we get .00246 and then we're get 0 0 0 0 1 5 digits of accuracy so this is newton's method and we use it to get approximations and sometimes in this case we got an approximation by just using a couple of calculations today we're going to talk about antiderivatives we'll begin with a definition a function capital f is called an antiderivative of the function little f on an interval i if we have capital f prime of x the derivative of that is equal to little f and this is going to be for all x in the interval i so what this is saying is before if we had some function little f and we took the derivative f prime that would be its derivative now we're going the other way we're taking the antiderivative and this often often happens when we have some function little f or we're going to call it capital f prime and we we don't know we know the derivative but we don't know what the original function was so we take the antiderivative and that's what we would get capital f so let's do an example if our function f of x is equal to 2x what's the antiderivative well in this case we need to think about what function whose derivative is equal to 2x well if you remember our original function will be x square the derivative of x squared is 2x similarly if we have a function g of x is equal to cosine of x what would its antiderivative be the derivative of what is cosine well the derivative of sine is cosine so in this case sine of x is the antiderivative of cosine and x squared is the antiderivative of 2x in the same way that 2x is a derivative of x squared or cosine is the derivative of sine but let's say we have functions f of x is let's say five x plus four the derivative of this is five but if we also had another function g of x who was five x plus 80 the derivative of g is still five so they're both going to be the same the derivatives are the same as long as we have some as long as uh the constants can be different and then the rest of the terms are going to be the same so the five x's are the same it's just the constants would be different so this leads us to a theorem if capital f is an antiderivative of f on an interval i then the most general antiderivative of f on i is the following is going to be capital f of x but we're just going to add some c plus c because it doesn't really matter as long as c is a constant so where c is an arbitrary constant because if we took the derivative of capital f or rather of this whole thing the derivative of all of this the derivative capital f becomes f prime which is the antiderivative and the derivative of c is zero now let's do another example find the most general derivative or antiderivative excuse me of f of x equaling x to the n well we're doing the power rule and if we're taking the derivative of say x to the fourth power that would be four times x to the four or excuse x to the four minus one so if we're going this way taking the derivative we're subtracting one and multiplying by that power if we're going to go the other way then what we would do is we would instead of multiply we would divide and instead of subtracting 1 we would add 1. so we would add one up here and divide by that power and we can test this what's the derivative of this well the derivative capital f prime is going to be the power times our function to the n plus one minus one power so n plus ones cancel and we're left with just x to the n which is what we started with so this leads us to a series of antiderivative formulas but before we do that i forgot that i was asking for the most general antiderivative and so that would be a plus c and so we'll have a function and then we'll have the particular anti derivative so if our function is some constant c little case c times our function f of x and the particular antiderivative is still c times f times our capital f of x if we're adding two functions f plus g of x then what we get would be the sum of two antiderivatives capital f of x plus capital g of x if we have the power rule n to some power and we're going to assume in this case n is not equal to negative one if we have this then we get x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 that's our antiderivative if our function is cosine of x then the antiderivative is sine of x but what about sine of x the derivative of what would be sine of x well derivative of cosine is sine so really using this first formula so the derivative of cosine is negative sine so we would take the negative and this would be negative of cosine of x if secant squared of x is our function the antiderivative the derivative of what would be secant squared well if you recall the derivative of tangent is secant squared and then the derivative or the antiderivative of secant times tangent of x well that antiderivative is secant because the derivative secant of x is secant tangent so let's do an example find the general antiderivative of the function f of x is equal to 3 times the square root of x plus let's say sine of x well we can rewrite this so this would be instead of writing as the square root of x we'll write it as x to the onehalf power plus sine of x and so the antiderivative of this is we have two different things so we can take the antiderivative of each one separately and so the antiderivative of three to the x three times x to the onehalf would be three times the antiderivative of x to the onehalf the antiderivative of x to the onehalf would be x to the onehalf plus one divided by onehalf plus one plus the antiderivative of sine what antiderivative sine is negative cosine of x and since we're taking the general antiderivative we're going to add plus c so here we get three times x to the three halves divided by three halves minus cosine of x plus c but this three and three halves well we can simplify if we're dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal so now we multiply by the reciprocal our threes cancel so this is just two x to the three halves minus cosine x plus c now an equation that involves derivatives in the original function is an equation that we call a differential equation because they have differentials in them and usually these differential equations will have some sort of initial condition so that we can figure out what that c value is that constant we get so let's do an example now recall that if we're dealing with something like s of t and that's the position then the derivative of your position s prime of of t is going to be your velocity and the derivative of the velocity or the second derivative of position so the second derivative is the derivative of the velocity which is acceleration and so if we were to work backwards the antiderivative of acceleration would be velocity and the antiderivative of velocity is position all right so now let's do this example we have a hot air balloon is ascending at a rate of 12 feet per second and is at a height 80 feet above the ground and when it's at 80 feet above the ground this is when a package is dropped what i want to know is how long does take the package to reach the ground so in this case we're going to start with the velocity and so we're going to call the velocity v of t and i'm going to change my color to blue for the solution just so that we don't get confused because there's a lot of words here now the acceleration due to gravity is 32 feet per second squared and this is uh for acceleration on earth the gravity on some other planet is going to be different okay so the acceleration due to gravity is 32 feet per second squared so we have a of t equals 32. now if we're going up then gravity is pulling you down and so we'd write negative 32 and i'm just going to drop the units so that's our acceleration now acceleration and we're going to refer to all these right here but i'm not going to have it on the screen so acceleration is really the derivative of velocity so that's really v prime of t so let's figure out what v of t is we want to find the antiderivative so v of t the velocity is the antiderivative of negative 32 well it's just negative 32 and so the antiderivative of negative 32 would be negative 32 t because taking the derivative of negative 32 t is just negative 32. now when we take the antiderivative we're going to add a plus c we get this constant so here we have our velocity in terms of time is negative 32 t plus c now we think about our initial condition so this right here initial condition initially when time was 0 what is our velocity so our velocity was negative 32 times 0 plus c but we were in a balloon that was going up in the air the initial velocity of the balloon was 12. because we're moving up we are ascending at 12 feet per second so this allows us to be able to figure out what c is so we can evaluate c and so our constant is 12. so our new and let me just change colors for this so our velocity equation for that is going to be v of t is negative 32 t plus 12. so that's our velocity now we're trying to find the position because we want to figure out what's the position function so to find that we know that the position well uh before i do that let me just back up one more step velocity is the same as the derivative of the position so velocity is the derivative of the position so we can figure out what's the position s of t we take s of t by taking the antiderivative of the velocity so the antiderivative of negative 32 t is negative 32 antiderivative of t using the the formula we have you add t to the power this is already really t to the power 1 so you do t to the power 1 plus 1 which is 2 over 2 plus now we're going to have 12. the antiderivative of 12 would be 12t and now we're going to have another constant when we end when we take the antiderivative so let's call this constant since we've already used c we'll call this constant d so now we have an equation for s of t but we still have a constant now we again we use our initial condition and so if we remember back from the equation initially the package was dropped at a height of 80 feet so moving back down to here initial condition we're going to have initial height s of 0 is going to be 80 feet above the ground in fact we can simplify this because we have negative 32 divided by 2 so let me just write it down here s of t is going to be negative 16 t squared plus 12 t plus d and so plugging in our initial condition s of zero we get zero plus zero plus d is equal to eighty so we know d is 80 and now we can figure out what's the formula for height so the formula for the height is going to be negative 16 t squared plus 12 d and we had plus d before but now we know d is going to be 80. so this is the equation for the height what we wanted to do is we want to find what's the time when the package hits the ground so we want to do is we want to find what is t when your height is equal to zero so we're going to set zero equals to negative 16 t squared plus 12 t plus 80. and so we can solve this maybe say using the quadratic formula or you're graphing or however you like to solve equations and we get that t is going to be negative 12 plus or minus the square root of 12 squared minus 4 times negative 16 times 80 divided by 2 times negative 16 and so this would give us that t is approximately negative 1.89 or t is approximately 2.64 seconds now we can't have a negative time so we rule that out and so we get for our answer it takes about 2.64 seconds to hit the ground today we're going to talk about areas and distances so let's first take a look at the curve y is equal to 1 minus x squared if we were to plot that what that graph looks like is something like this so this is 0.5 and we have 1 and so 1 minus x squared that is a parabola facing down whose vertex is up at 1. so we have this something like this it crosses down here at the point one so now given this how can we figure out what's the area under this curve what is this area now we know how to find areas of nice geometric shapes like a rectangle or a triangle but this is neither of those shapes what we can do is we can make an approximation and we can say well let's sort of break this off into two different rectangles and so we'll pick the point right here and we'll go across we have something like this and then again at this point right here we'll go across i'm gonna go back down and so shading what we'll get is we'll have two rectangles but the thing is this is an approximation but it's a bigger approximation because this area right here and this right here we're counting that in our approximation and that doesn't fall in there so in fact maybe i should have colored this a different color so this is all the extra shading and that shouldn't be belong there can we do a better approximation sure so let's try so instead of using two different approxim two different rectangles let's make four rectangles and each of these rectangles is going to be equidistant so this is going to be 0.25 0.5 0.75 and 1. and so we're going to go ahead start up here go across and we hit that and then each time i'm going to start at the left wherever this line touches our curve i'm going to start right there so we go ahead go across then we go up take that point go across up and then go across and up so now we have four rectangles that's approximating this and and this is getting a little bit better so you see the error is is better it's not as much i'm going to draw our first approximation so our first approximation actually went all the way up here and went all the way over here and if we were to shade that that first approximation had a much larger error all of this area so that's a pretty big area our second approximation the error the error is just these areas so we got a little bit better we no longer had this as our error so we're improving could we do better sure let's just make more rectangles so if we made more rectangles so each of these rectangles would have a distance of 0.125 instead of 0.25 so 0.125 then what that would be is we'd have this first one and now we'd go over here and then following this we go up and actually i'm going to change my color for these lines okay we have that go right here and then keep having each of these and so again you're going to see our error is getting better and better and better so now the error that we get is far better than ever before uh let me change let me use a darker shade so each of these errors is smaller and smaller so we are getting more and more accurate so compared to our first approximation where we use two rectangles this is much better and then we used four rectangles it got better now we're using eight rectangles and we can use more and more and more and we get better and better and better each time so just redrawing this on a clean slate so we get y is equal to 1 minus x squared this point right here is the point one comma one and if we had split this up and let's say let's just do four approximations so we have one or four rectangles rather we have two three and then four approximations now this approximation we're going over so we're we we're missing over too large of an area by that now this approximation we're going to be using uh for each of these rectangles we're using the lefthand endpoint and we're using four of these so we're going to call this l 4 for the left hand approximation left point and left endpoint approximation using four rectangles so let's calculate what l four is we're going to approximate or we want to calculate the area of each of these rectangles well the width so if our total distance was zero to one for the x values and we split it up into four pieces then we know that each of these right here each rectangle has a width of 0.25 0.25 0.25 and 0.25 so now we need to figure out what's the height well if our function f of x is one minus two x we're gonna figure out go all the way up and we just plug in your left endpoint so this one is one one we knew that this was or you could have thought of it as 1 comma f of 1. this point right here is going to be 0.25 comma f of 0.25 this point right here is going to be 0.5 comma f of 0.5 and then this point is going to be 0.75 comma f of 0.75 and so the area of a rectangle is base times height so we're going to have 0.25 times f of 0 and excuse me this is not 1 1 this is 0 1. so f of 0 plus another base times height for our second rectangle is 0.25 times f of 0.25 plus 0.25 times f of a half and finally plus 0.25 times f of 0.75 so i'm going to sort of move this over a little bit and what we get is we get 0.25 times well this first value would be 1 plus let me use fractions 0.25 is 1 4 times 15 over 16 that's times and the minus plus onefourth times threefourths and then plus onefourth times sevensixteenths i got each of these numbers by evaluating f of those values f of 0.75 is 1 minus 0.75 squared and we end up with or seven sixteenths so adding this all together we're going to get that the area is equal to zero point eight seven five or rather this should be the l4 well we took the left hand approximation we can do the same thing we can do a right hand approximation so we have our f of x is equal to 1 minus x squared we have x and y this is our point one we've got another point one right here so we can still split it up into four segments but instead of starting at the left and then going across we would start at the right so each of these intervals each of these rectangles would go up and then we'd go across and here we'd go up and across up and across and well right here it that's already touching so we don't need to go up at all and we go across but you may notice by doing the right hand approximation we're missing out on some areas right here in fact this is a pretty big area so the lefthand approximation we had overestimated now we're underestimating but that's all right i mean these are our approximations and so this would be our r 4 approximation for rectangles using the right hand approximation or the right endpoint and so each of these is going to be a width of 0.25 just like the last screen so our first rectangle is going to be width is 0.25 times the height is going to be f of 0.25 since we're using the right part of this endpoint then we're going to use this next one plus 0.25 times f of 0.5 this mid this second rectangle the right hand is going to be right there plus 0.25 times f of 0.75 and then finally this last rectangle is 0.25 times f of 1 but in this case f of 1 is 0 so that would have gone away now we could do another approximation okay this is f of x is 1 minus x squared now instead of doing a left or right approximation what we could have done is at each interval use the midpoint go halfway up and so i guess this graph was should that shouldn't be there it's a little sloppy but we go about halfway up all right what we do that's going to be our interval we take the midpoint from here to here and then we go up again take the midpoint go up and as you can see by doing this we're going to have some areas where we're overestimating but we also have some areas where we underestimate and so this midpoint approximation cancels it out so this would be the midpoint approximation we'll call it m4 each of these still has a width of 0.25 so they both have they all have a width of 0.25 but these midpoints is now going to be the midpoint that's 0.125 this midpoint right here is going to be 0.375 this midpoint is 0.625 and then this midpoint is 0.875 so we would have midpoint approximation we get for our first rectangle plus our second rectangle and then our third rectangle would get this and plus 0.25 times f 0.878 so these would be the approximations we get for our midpoint so if you're trying to approximate the area under this curve this is y is equal to 1 minus x squared you can use oh that's pretty bad axis we can use rectangles and let's say we're just going to use the right rectangle using two we got pretty bad error uh area we're missing a lot using four rectangles we're getting a little bit better but we still have quite a bit of error if we use eight rectangles getting better if we use 16 we're getting even better we're getting closer and closer and closer the more rectangles we get so if we we then use more we use say 32 and so the more and more intervals we use the better our accuracy so now let's create a table so the first column in the table is going to be i'm just going to clear this all the way out the first column of the table is going to be the number of sub intervals that we have number of sub intervals and then if we use say the left hand or the right hand or the midpoint so so we'll have our right approximation so the number of subintervals we'll say that that's going to be our n and then we have our right approximation and then we have our midpoint approximation and we have our left hand approximation l sub n and if you remember i'll sketch it right here if we're doing the lefthand approximation that's going to be over guessing because we have all this extra right here and then if we do the righthand approximation we're under gassing okay so and then the midpoint might balance it out you have a little bit more in some spots you'll have a little less in other spots so like this interval right here you overestimate it but then you underestimate it so that might cancel out so if we have just two subintervals the lower sum is going to be 0.3 for the righthand sum the midpoint is going to be 0.6875 and then the lefthand sum is 0.875 if we have four sub intervals we're going to get 0.53125 we're going to get 0.671875 and then 0.78125 and so if you notice the left hand is going to be a a larger number than the right hand and then the midpoint should fall somewhere in between okay let's go up to 16 intervals and so the right hand approximation is going to be 0.63476 uh we'll stop we'll do one more six the midpoint is going to be 0.66699 and then the lefthand approximation is 0.697 i'm going to stop it at 3. all right so these numbers are getting closer to each other if we went up to let's say 50 sub intervals then we'd get 0.6566 we'd get 0.6667 and then six 0.6766 you might be able to see that these numbers are approaching something but if not we'll do a little bit more 100 intervals we'll get 0.66165 0.666675 and then 0.6716 and if we say went up to a thousand we would get zero point six six six one six six five zero point six six six six six six seven five and then zero point six six seven one six six five all right and again each of these would each of these values would have been compu computed rather by multiplying the width of each sub interval times the height which would have been our function at either the left midpoint or right hand side of that interval and then taking the sum of all those so this last one would have been taking the sum of 1000 rectangles so we notice that this is approaching if we took infinite one is going to be approaching twothirds and so what we would say is the area is equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of r sub n the right hand approximation but this is also equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of the midpoint approximation m n and the limit as n approaches infinity of ln so we can get our area by taking the infinite limit but this would mean we'd have to take the infinite sum of infinite rectangles now let's just study some arbitrary curve like this so this is y is equal to f x and let's find the area under this curve x and y and let's just start from some point a to b let's divide this up into n intervals and so we'd have we'll call this s1 s2 s3 and we'd have a bunch of ones in between we'll have some arbitrary interval in the middle call this s sub i and then a very last interval would be s sub n so in between we have a bunch of stuff so we start off our first point will be a and then we're going to start labeling each of these values we'll call that x1 then we'll call this one x2 call this x3 so at the end of each section so si the end of si would be x sub i what about at the beginning of s i well that's just the one before it so that would be x of x or x i minus one and then finally the beginning of our sn would be x sub well if this is the nth one the start of it would be x of n minus one and i'm just going to put a couple of dots in between here so we know that there is maybe some arbitrary space well what's the interval what's what's the gap or the width of each of these rectangles we'll call it delta x well delta x is going to be well how far is the whole thing the distance is going to be or the length is b minus a and if we're breaking it up into n intervals then that length b minus a divided by n is how long each of these intervals would be so now how do you figure out what's the value of x1 well x1 if we started off at a and this interval has a length of delta x x1 is a plus delta x but what about x2 well x2 we started off at a we added a delta x and then we added another delta x so x2 is going to be a plus 2 times delta x x3 would be a plus 3 times delta x and so forth and so now what we can do is we can figure out the approximation the right hand approximation r sub n for this would be the of each rectangle is length times height or length times width delta x times our height and so the height would be f of whatever x1 you know x1 or x2 and so forth and we have our x1 x2 right here so r sub n would be f of x one times delta x remember we're using the right hand approximation so for our first rectangle we're using the right hand the second approximation we're going to use that right hand so plus f of x two times delta x plus f of x three times delta x plus so forth and i sort of ran out of space and let me go up one more line plus dot dot dot plus f of x n times delta x so this leads us to our first definition the definition says the area of the region and we'll call that region s this is the region that lies under the curve or under the graph of the continuous function f is the limit of the sum of areas of approximating rectangles and here we go here's the formula it's going to be area is equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of r sub n and so if r if r sub n is what's written above then this is really the limit as n approaches infinity of the following f of x sub 1 times delta x plus f of x sub 2 times delta x plus so forth all the way to our last term f of x sub n times delta x that's how we find the area under the curve now another way to write this this infinite sum is using something that we call sigma notation sigma notation is going to be as follows if we're taking the sum and we're taking the sum of f of x one plus f of x two plus f of x three and so forth instead of writing it all out what we can do is write a sigma like this sigma and we'll say some index number some i goes from 1 to n and we'd say f of x sub i times delta x and what this means is that i is going to go from 1 all the way up to n and so when i is 1 this is f of x 1 times delta x plus and then you move up in number this now becomes i becomes two and so this is f of x two times delta x plus f of x three times delta x all the way up to n now let's take a look at something called the distance problem we know that distance is equal to velocity times time because velocity is distance over time so if you multiply both sides by time distance is velocity multiplied by time so let's say we're driving in the car and we don't know the odometer reading but we do know how fast we're going we do know our velocity and so if if we knew our velocity at certain time we could figure out how far we've traveled so let's say we have time and the unit for time is going to be in seconds and then we're going to have our velocity and the unit for velocity is going to be feet per second so we start off with when we start our taking a look look at our recordings at time is zero so we're moving we start the timer time zero we're going 25 feet per second and then after five more seconds we take a look and we're traveling 31 feet per second and then after 10 seconds we're traveling at a speed of 35 feet per second in 15 minutes then we're going to travel 43 feet per second 20 seconds we'll travel 47 25 seconds it'll be 45 and then at 30 seconds we're traveling at 41 feet per second how far have we traveled well if we were to plot this it would look something like we have a bunch of rectangles and it starts to look like what we had before when we're finding the areas so it goes up for the first five intervals we're counting 25 31 35 43 47 and then it starts to go back down a little bit 45 and then 41. so it's not my this graph is not entirely accurate but it's close enough so to figure out how far we've traveled distance is velocity times time and so if we're using say the lefthand approximation which is kind of what i drew right here then the distance traveled is going to be so for the distance uh that's going to be we're using the lefthand approximation so that's our delta x 5 times our height which in this case we didn't need to figure it out because it's already given as opposed to figuring out what f of x sub 1 is or so forth so 5 times 25 plus 5 times 31 plus 5 times 35 plus 5 times 43 plus 5 times 47 plus 5 times 45 and so calculating all this we get 1130 feet now if we were to instead use the right hand approximation so in this case the lefthand approximation leaves us where doing we're underestimating if we did the right hand approximation we would overestimate so let's just do that the right hand approximation so it'll be five times our first rectangle using the right hand approximation we're going to start off with the second value so 5 times 31 plus 5 times 35 plus 5 times 43 plus 5 times 47 plus 5 times 45 and then the last point plus 5 times 41 and what we get here is we get 1210 feet so we knew that we were a little bit over but this is sort of an approximation we don't we don't know exactly how far we went in each interval you know we in between we could have sped up at the very end or sped up early but we don't know but this leads us to the equation for distance and that is distance is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of and we're going to use sigma notation the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of t and this is sub i minus one so that we're doing the lefthand approximation times delta t or if we did the right hand approximation this would have been the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of t sub i times delta t today we're going to talk about the definite integral so we'll begin defining what is the definite integral if f is a function defined for x being between a and b and including on the endpoints then we divide the interval a to b into n sub intervals and each of these sub intervals are going to be of equal width and we'll say that equal width is going to be called delta x and if you remember from before delta x is going to be b minus a divided by n now if we let x0 be our first point a and then we have x1 x2 so forth all the way to the last point x sub n and that's going to be equal to our b would be the end points so each of these are the endpoints of the sub intervals not intervals but rather sub intervals and we let these points x1 star x2 star and so forth all the way to xn star and we're going to say these are going to be any sample points and so sample points really are just the points that can be uh the left endpoint or the right endpoint and so we might want to pick sample points that would make sure that we're getting a pretty good approximation half of that is going to be above and half of it's going to be below if you notice sometimes before if we just did the left approximation we might overestimate everything or underestimate so sample points are something that allows flexibility so if these are sample points in the sub intervals so that x sub i star so for some arbitrary i this lies in the ith sub interval from x sub i minus 1 to x sub i so we're not done just yet and then we say then we say that the definite integral the definite integral of f from a to b this definite integral is going to be defined to be the following so this is not an s this is an integral sign the integral from a to b of f of x times dx and this is the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of x sub i star times delta x so we have all this and this is provided the limit exists and gives the same value for all possible choices of sample points if this does not exist we say that f sorry if it does exist so if it does exist then we say f is going to be and the definition here is integrable and it'll be integrable on the interval a to b this definition is something that we call a riemann sum and riemann sum is spelt rie mann so this is riemann sum and so just a note this right here this is the integral sign and then if we have for dealing with something like this the integral from a to b of f of x dx we're going to say that f of x is the integrand a and b are the limits of integration a is the lower limit b is the upper limit and then we're always going to have this dx it just simply indicates that the independent variable that we're dealing with is x and so the whole procedure of calculating an integral this is what we call integration and again this dx just tells us that that's the variable we're dealing with we could have been dealing with another variable say like the integral from a to b of f of t and if t is our variable then we would say dt or if it's r it would be dr so we have a couple of theorems the first theorem say says if f is continuous on the interval a to b or if f has only a finite number of jump discontinuities then the function f is integrable on a to me a to b that uh what this means is so that is the definite integral the integral from a to b of f of x dx exists the next theorem states if f is integrable all right now we know how to find its if it's integral integrable from the previous theorem so if it's integrable on the interval a to b then we have i'm going to change my my pen for this we have the integral from a to b of f of x dx which is equal to the sum where n or gives me the limit not the sum but the limit so it's equal to the limit where n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of x sub i times delta x and this is where we have that delta x is b minus a over n and our x sub i is really our starting point a plus i times delta x depending on which rectangle or which inter sub interval we're dealing with all right let's do an example if i'm given the limit as x excuse me not as x but as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from one this is a terrible uh sum let me rewrite that the sum where i goes from 1 to n of the quantity x sub i cubed plus x sub i times sine of x sub i times delta x write this as an integral on the interval 0 to pi well if we wrote this as the integral this would be the integral from 0 to pi of the inside stays the same so it's still going to be the same function so except x sub i is just going to be replaced with x so x plus or x cubed plus x times sine of x and then when we finish this we want to make sure we're different or we're integrating with respect to our variable x so we put times dx now i'm going to go over some formulas and rules to help evaluate integrals so the first one is the sum where i goes from 1 to n of just i meaning we're taking i or 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 so forth all the way to n this is actually can be written as n times n plus 1 over 2. the next thing is the sum where i goes from 1 to n of i squared so again this is 1 squared plus 2 squared plus 3 squared all the way to n squared this is n times n plus 1 times 2n plus 1. this is all over 6. the next formula we have is the sum where i goes from 1 to n of i cubed and this is the quantity n times n plus 1 all over 2 this whole quantity squared now here are some rules that would help us when working with sigma notation and that is the sum where i goes from 1 to n of c well c doesn't relate to i so it's basically we're adding c n times writing c plus c plus c whereas before so like in this case this number changed they went from to whatever i was changing to but there's no i so it's just c plus c plus c and times so in other words this is just n times c if we have the sum where i goes from 1 to n of c times some a sub i well that c is a constant so we can just say c times that whole sum let me rewrite my sigma notation times the sum where i goes from 1 to n of a sub i now we can do another one so the sum where i goes from 1 to n of the quantity a sub i plus b sub i we can split this up into two different sums the sum where i goes from 1 to n of a sub i plus the sum where i goes from 1 to n of b sub i and similarly if we're subtracting the sum excuse me not n but the sum where i goes from 1 to n of a sub i minus b sub i is going to be the sum i goes from 1 to n of a sub i minus the sum where i goes from 1 to n of b sub i all right now let's do an example evaluate the riemann sum for f of x equals x cubed minus 6x and we'll use our endpoints a to b 0 b to be 3 and then we're going to pick n is going to be 6. so if n is 6 what's our delta x so all so this is all what's given so delta x is going to be our b minus a over n which is three minus zero over six or it's going to be one half so our right endpoint is a zero so our x sub zero which is a is 0 then the next point x1 is going to be so we're going by a half it's going to be 0.5 x2 is 1.0 x3 is 1.5 x4 2.0 x5 is 2.5 and then x6 was our endpoint b so x6 which is b is really 3.0 so the riemann sum r6 is going to be the sum where i goes from 1 to n or 1 to 6 rather of f of x sub i times delta x so we're going to get our first we f of 0.5 times delta x plus f of 1.0 times delta x plus f of 1.5 times delta x plus f of 2.0 times delta x plus f of 2.5 times delta x plus f of 3.0 times delta x and so giving me a little bit more space and remembering our function f of x is x cubed minus 6x and so this all can be simplified since delta x is really one half i'm going to factor out delta x from everything and so we get f of 0.5 ends up being negative 2.875 f of 1 is negative 5. f of 1.5 is negative 5.625 f of 2 is negative 4 f of 2.5 so now we're getting to positive numbers and that's 0.625 and then f of 3 ends up being 9. so this whole thing we get negative 3.9375 and what you notice is this is actually a negative number well if we were to have graphed this what this would have looked like something like that and so we did pick a couple of points right here our first rectangle second rectangle our third rectangle fourth rectangle and then our fifth rectangle comes positive and then our sixth rectangle is also going to be positive but if we're below the axis then it's a negative value and so that's why most of this is going to be below and so we end up with a negative riemann sum now continuing on this example calculate the integral from 0 to 3 of x cubed minus 6x dx well what's our delta x gonna be so delta x is b minus a over n and so b is three is zero so b minus a over n is three over n we started off our x zero was zero our x one if we're going at intervals of three over n is zero plus three over n or just 3 over n or x 2 we add another 3 over n so that's going to be 6 over n and so forth x 3 would be 9 over n so in general we'd get x sub i is equal to 3i over n and this is since we're using the right endpoints well since we're using the right endpoints rather we can write that this integral is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of x sub i times delta x and now we can fill in we know what x of i is and we know what delta x is so this is the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of x sub i is going to be 3 i over n times delta x our delta x is going to be 6 over n and so now we know we can start filling some things out excuse me not 6 over n 3 over n so using what we know 3 over n does not relate to i so we can pull this whole thing in front of the sigma in front of the sum so we get the limit as n goes to infinity of 3 over n times the sum where i goes from 1 to n and what's f of 3i over n where our function was x cubed minus 6x so this is going to be the quantity 3i over n cubed 3i over n cubed minus 6 times 3i over n now you're probably thinking this is not the nicest thing and you're probably right it's not that nice so this is going to be the limit as n goes to infinity of 3 over n times now we'll go ahead and and uh factor out inside here or multiply so this becomes 3i over n cubed 27 i cubed over n cubed minus 18 i over n now we're subtracting two sums so or we're taking the sum of the subtracted and so because of this difference we can split this up into two summations and when we split this up this 27 over n squared and this 18 over n they don't deal with i so we can pull them out so this is going to be 27 over n squared times the sum where i goes from 1 to n of i cubed minus 18 over n times the sum where i goes from 1 to n of just i now we know what this sum we know this sum and we know this sum so let's keep forging ahead this is the limit where n goes to infinity of 3 over n times the quantity 27 over n squared times now this we know to be n times n plus one over two quantity squared oops uh this should have been an n cubed way up here that should be an n cubed then that should be an n cubed because that was 3 0 3 i over n quantity cubed so sorry about that and then minus 18 over n times and then the sum where i goes from 1 to n of i this is n times n plus 1 over 2 and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to multiply this times this and just 3n times that right there so we get the limit as n goes to infinity of we have 81 over n to the fourth times squaring this we also have an n squared and plus 1 squared and this is going to be divided by 4 minus and we get 54 over let's see we have n out here so 3 times 18 is 54 and n times n would be n squared and then we still have times n n plus 1 over 2. so we can still simplify some more so doing that we get the limit as n goes to infinity of we get from this first term we can pull out the constants 81 over 4 and now let's see this n squared and this n to the fourth cancels that'll be n over over n squared and so that's going to be n plus 1 over n squared and in fact we could do a little simplification yes so we get n plus 1 squared over n squared minus 54. times well 54 over 2 rather so back that up sorry we get 27 times n times n plus 1 over n squared still not the nicest thing but remember we're taking the limit as n goes to infinity so we're almost there this can be the limit n goes to infinity of the quantity 81 over four and this factors n squared plus 2n plus 1 over n squared minus and this is 27 times the quantity n squared plus n over n squared and so this all becomes the limit as n goes to infinity of 81 over 4 times the quantity and this is going to be 1 plus 1 over n excuse me 2 over n plus 1 over n squared minus 27 times and then we get 1 plus 1 over n all right almost there the limit as n goes to infinity well if n goes to infinity this term goes to 0 this term goes to 0 and this term goes to 0 and we're almost there so this is going to be 81 over 4 minus 27 which is negative 6.75 so this is what that area is under the curve that looks something like this so we have that area and this area more negative than positive but that's what we got and it was way better than our estimate using the riemann sum where we got negative 3.9375 i'm sure if we did the riemann sum where we found a lot more it would be a lot better so if we did riemann sum for 40 we get negative six point three nine nine nine eight if we did with n is five thousand we'd get pretty close negative six point seven four seven three so you think about this this was a very long method to do this problem but it sure beats calculating when n is five thousand doing five thousand summations now let's do an example remember calculating the area or calculating the integral of something is basically finding the area under that curve so if we're trying to calculate the area under the curve of 1 minus x squared dx and we're going from 0 to 1 or in other words the integral from 0 to 1 of the square root of 1 minus x squared that is the same as finding the area so rather than actually going through and trying to calculate this sometimes it's just useful to draw what that looks like well what is this if we had y is the square root of 1 minus x squared if we squared both sides we get y squared 1 minus x squared or x squared plus y squared is one so it's a circle centered at the origin with radius one and uh since this is the square root meaning our y value is only going to be positive so we can ignore this stuff below the axis and then our our x is going from zero to one so really we're just going to be going from 0 to 1 so we're just concerned with this right here this is 1 4 the area of a circle so the area is 1 4 pi r squared and since r is 1 this is just pi over 4. so we can calculate the error or the integral from 0 to 1 of the square root of 1 minus x squared dx is pi over four let's do another example what about the integral from zero to 3 of the quantity x minus 1 dx well again we're just trying to find the area under curve so if we were to graph this this is going to be at negative one at zero it crosses the axis at one and it goes up and when x is three your y value is going to be 2. what we have here are two triangles we'll call these two triangles a 1 and a 2. if it's below the axis it's negative if it's above the axis is positive well a1 is going to be it's negative but what is the area of the triangle one half base times height so one half one times one so that's a1 and this is going to be just negative onehalf a2 is onehalf base times height so this is two by twos and so this is going to be two so the integral is just this negative one half plus two and we get this is going to be 1.5 so sometimes calculating the areas or the integrals not as bad as the last example we had did now calculating the integral using the midpoint rule the midpoint rule says the integral from a to b of f of x dx is equal to the sum where i goes from 1 to n of f of x sub i and we're going to use bar x of y bar times delta x and what this is this is delta x times f of x 1 bar plus so forth all the way to f of x n bar so this is we're going to say our delta x is the same b minus a over n and our x sub i bar that's the average or the midpoint so we're going to it's going to be one half of the left part of the sub interval so x sub i minus 1 plus x sub i taking the averages of this so in other words midpoint of the interval x sub i minus 1 to x sub i now we're going to go over some properties of the definite integral the first property says that and let me change my ink right here so the first property says the integral from normally we go from a to b so the integral from b to a of f of x dx so if we're going backwards this is negative the integral a to b of f of x dx so if we go backwards then it changes what about if your a and b are equal so this is the integral from a to a of f of x dx well you don't have any area there's nothing to go under since it's just a single point so the integral is zero right so here's more properties the integral from a to b of just some constant c dx well that's just c times b minus a okay this is where c is a constant so if you think about that constant if we looked at the picture the constant's just a horizontal line so if you're from a to b of a horizontal line we have a rectangle area of the rectangle is base times height the next property we have the integral from a to b of the sum f of x plus g of x dx well this is really the integral from a to b of f of x dx plus the integral from a to b g of x dx if we have an integral from a to b of some constant times your function f of x dx this is just the constant times the integral from a to b of f of x dx again c is the constant if we have the integral from a to b of the difference f of x minus g of x dx this is the integral from a to b of f of x dx minus the integral from a to b g of x dx now the fifth one if we have some let's say looking on like a number line if a is over here b is over here and c is in between and you go a to c and c so you go from a to c and then c to b it's the same as going all the way in fact this works where c doesn't even need to be between a and b c could be on the outside but we get we get the following the integral from a to c of f of x dx plus the integral from c to b of f of x dx is equal to the integral from a to b of f of x dx and now we have a couple of properties where we compare the integrals and so this first property says that if f of x is greater than or equal to 0 this is 4 a being less than or equal to x being less than or equal to b then the integral from a to b of f of x dx so if our function is always going to be a positive then the integral will be positive if we have f of x is greater than or equal to another function g of x for a less than equal to x less than or equal to b then we have the integral from a to b of f of x dx will be greater than or equal to the integral from a to b of g of x dx and then if m is less than or equal to f of x which is less than or equal to capital m for a is less than or equal to x is less than equal to b then we have that m times b minus a is less than or equal to the integral from a to b of f of x dx is less than or equal to capital m times b minus a and really what we did right here was we took the interval or the integral of little m and of capital m but using that property property one the integral is just that today we're going to talk about the fundamental theorem of calculus so the fundamental theorem of calculus states the following if we have some function f and it's continuous on some closed interval a to b then we have that the function g this function g is going to be defined by the following where g of x is equal to the integral from a to x of f of t dt and we have x is going to be between a and b so if this is what we have and now we're dealing with our function it's g of x and x goes right here but really this integral is integrating over t so our function is f of t and dt so it's not f of x like how it's g of x it's f of t so if we have this then the function g of x defined by that is continuous on the interval a to b and it's differentiable on the interval the open interval a to b and we have the following we have that g prime of x is equal to f of x so if we were to take the derivative of this right here taking that derivative derivative of g prime is just going to give you f of x so this derivative whole integral will give you f of x now think about this this is mainly dealing with some something related to t the only x in here so if we're taking the derivative with respect to x the only x is going to relate to right here and so the derivative of the integral is going backwards is just going to give you your f of x okay now let's do some examples let's use use the fundamental theorem of calculus to find the derivative d y d x if a y is equal to the integral from a to x of the quantity t cubed plus 1 dt so using the fundamental theorem of calculus d y d x is just going to be the derivative of this whole integral and all we're doing is we're taking this inside function t cubed plus one and instead of using t we write x so this becomes x cubed plus one now if we had another function let's say y is equal to the integral from a to x of secant squared t dt the derivative d y d x again we're just taking the inside function the secant squared of t and we're replacing the t with x so this is secant squared x that's our answer now if we had another function let's let's say c y is equal to the integral from x to 5 of 3t times sine of t dt well this is slightly different because this is going from x to 5 instead of 5 to x so if we're taking d y d x and this is really the derivative d d x of the integral from x to 5 of 3t sine of t dt now what we learned the other day is that this is the same this integral if we switch it so an integral of going from a to b a to b of f of x dx is the same as negative integral from b b to a of f of x dx so using this right here this is going to be negative integral from 5 to x of 3t sine of t dt and now using the fundamental theorem of calculus this is just going to be negative and we're going to replace all of our t's in here with x's so negative 3 x sine of x and that's your answer okay so let's let's add another layer of complex i'll make this just a little bit more complex so d if y is equal to the integral from 1 to x squared of cosine of t dt what we do here when we take the derivative d y d x this is going to be d y d x of the integral from 1 to x squared of cosine t dt but now we're actually going to use a little substitution okay because this is x squared and not x so let's make the substitution let's let u equal x squared so this becomes the derivative and sorry then this is not d y d x this is just d d x so what we get here is this is the derivative d d x of the integral from one to u of cosine t dt and if we're trying to use the chain rule the chain rule says if we're taking the derivative ddx and we want to change it now that we're dealing with u's we're going to write this as d d u of the integral 1 to u of cosine of t dt times the chain rule the derivative of u with respect to x now this may look confusing but really what we're doing here is this first part is the fundamental theorem of calculus so this is the um excuse me using the fundamental theorem of calculus this is going to be just cosine of u because u is our new variable times the derivative of u and i'll write it as d u dx and sorry this is u not t so cosine of u and so cosine of u is u right here is x squared so this is cosine of x squared times the derivative of u is just 2x so this is what the answer should be or 2x times cosine of x squared so looking back at this what we had this is where we started the fundamental theorem of calculus says that this is going to be well looking at here we still have cosine of whatever that is cosine of x squared but now all we did was we add the derivative of x squared which is 2x so let's just try one more and we won't do all those all those smaller steps okay so let's say we have y is equal to the integral from 4 to 1 plus 3 x squared and let's say of t squared dt so the derivative d y d x is going to be so what we're doing using fundamental theorem of calculus we replace this with that variable up here so that's just going to be 1 plus 3 x squared quantity squared times the chain rule times the derivative of 1 plus 3x squared and so we get this is 1 plus 3x squared quantity squared times the derivative here is 6x now we have the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus and this says the following if f is continuous on the interval a to b then the integral from a to b of f of x dx is equal to capital f of b minus capital f of a where we define capital f to be any antiderivative of our little f so that is a function capital f such that capital f prime the derivative of that is little f so the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of this is really the antiderivative at the second at this point minus the antiderivative at this point and sometimes instead of writing f of b minus f of a we'll use the shorthand notation f of x and this means we're going to evaluate this f from a to b and sometimes you'll see it with just a straight line and that just means f of x is evaluated from a to b now let's do some examples the integral from 0 to pi of cosine of x dx well what is this going to be well the antiderivative of cosine of x is sine of x okay if you remember that the antiderivative cosine of x is sine of x and so this is just going to be sine of x evaluated from zero to pi meaning this is going to be sine of pi minus sine of zero because the the fundamental theorem of calculus says the integral from a to b of f of x dx is the antiderivative evaluated at the second endpoint pi minus evaluated at the first endpoint so let's do another example so let's call this example a and we'll look at b so now let's evaluate the integral from negative pi over four to zero of secant of x times tangent of x dx now if you remember the antiderivatives the antiderivative of secant times tangent of x that's just going to be that's just secant of x so what we have here is this is going to be secant of x evaluated from negative pi over four to zero and i'm sorry we didn't really finish this first one because we know what sine of pi is what's sine of pi well that's zero and then sine of zero is also zero so this is just going to be zero and so now we evaluated this integral without actually having to compute any uh any areas of rectangles and whatnot so same thing here so now this is going to be secant of uh not secant of x secant of 0 minus secant of negative pi over four well secant of zero is going to be one minus secant of negative pi over four if you remember from trigonometry that's uh that's just root two so we get one minus root two now let's do another example evaluate the integral from one to four of the quantity 3 halves times the square root of x minus 4 over x squared dx so now we need to figure out what's the antiderivative of all of this well let's actually give ourselves a little bit more space so we can work with right here so what's the antiderivative of three halves square root of x or threehalves x to the onehalf power well the antiderivative of that is x to the threehalves so this is just going to be x to the three halves minus and what's the antiderivative and this is our little scratch work right here it's the antiderivative of four over x squared what might be easier if we looked at it as four times x to the negative 2 power and so the antiderivative of this is going to be negative 4 times x to the negative 1. and you can double check this by taking the derivative of this term and seeing that the derivative of this term and seeing that it's equal to that one right there now another another way of writing this is going to be negative 4 over x x to the negative 1 is really the same as saying dividing by x to the 1 power so now what we have is we're subtracting right here subtracting a negative so really we're going to add 4 over x and this is evaluated from 1 to 4. so plugging this in we're first going to go through this evaluating at 4 and then we're going to subtract this evaluating that one so evaluated at 4 we get not x but rather four to the three halves plus four over four and then we're going to evaluate it at one one to the three halves plus four over one oops three halves right there and so we get this should be eight plus one minus one plus 4 and so this is going to be equal to 4. so now we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus to find a lot of things if given let's say velocity so if we know that v of t is the velocity of something and we also know that s of t is the position and if we're given that the velocity is the derivative of the position then we could calculate the integral of the velocity from a to b dt that's really s of b minus s of a this is done using the fundamental theorem of calculus and what is this if we're subtracting our position from this endpoint minus the position of our start point that's the distance traveled so if you just need to know what's the distance you traveled you just take the the fundamental theorem of calculus or this antiderivative or this integral we could also use this in applying say finding the area under a curve so find the area under the parabola this is y is equal to x squared from zero to one so the solution to this is going to be well if our f of x is x squared what's the antiderivative what would capital f of x be well the antiderivative of x squared is 1 3 x cubed and so the area is going to be the integral from 0 to 1 because that's where we're going from 0 to 1 of our function x squared dx that's the area and now using the fundamental theorem of calculus we're going to say this is the antiderivative one third x cubed or x cubed over three evaluated from zero to one so this is going to be one cubed over three minus zero cubed over three which is just one third so let's just combine everything and rewrite the fundamental theorem of calculus and what the fundamental theorem of calculus states is suppose f is continuous on the closed interval a to b then we're going to have two things one if g of x is equal to the integral from a to x of f of t dt then g prime of x is equal to f of x and then two the integral from a to b of f of x dx is equal to capital f of b minus capital f of a and this is going to be where capital f is any anti derivative of little f that is capital f is equal to little f today we're going to talk about indefinite integrals and the net change theorem now the notation if you write the integral of f of x dx this is traditionally used for an antiderivative of f and what this is called is the indefinite integral and so if we wrote the indefinite integral and we said this is equal to capital f of x this means that the derivative of capital f of x is little f of x so for example the indefinite integral of x squared dx well the antiderivative of x squared is x cubed over 3 plus c and that's because if we took this term on the right all this stuff you took the derivative of x cubed over 3 plus c well the derivative of x cubed is three x squared over three and the derivative of c well c is a constant so derivative constant is zero so this is just x squared which was that function on the inside now let's take a look at this table of indefinite integrals so the integral the indefinite integral of some constant c times f of x dx is you can just pull this the constant out and that's just c times the integral of f of x dx same thing if we're adding two functions the indefinite integral of f plus g of x dx becomes the indefinite integral of f of x dx plus the indefinite integral of g of x dx the indefinite integral of just a constant k times dx is going to be kx plus c remember when we take the indefinite integral we would be adding a an integrating constant c the indefinite integral of x to the n becomes x to the n plus one over n plus one again plus c the indefinite integral of sine of x well the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine plus c of course the indefinite integral of cosine is going to be sine since the antiderivative of cosine is sine and then we again add plus c the indefinite integral of secant squared of x dx becomes tangent of x plus c the indefinite integral of cosecant squared of x is cotangent plus c and the indefinite integral of secant of x times tangent of x is secant of x plus c and then finally the indefinite integral of cosecant of x times cotangent of x is negative cosecant of x plus c so let's do some examples find the general indefinite integral of 10 x to the 4 minus 2 times secant squared of x dx so using that table we have two different things so we can break it up into two integrals we're subtracting and then also we have a constant in front so we can pull these constants in front this 10 and this 2. so we get first off we get 10 times the integral of x to the 4 dx minus 2 times the integral secant squared x dx so this becomes the integral of x to the four dx becomes x to the fifth over five and so if we were to add the plus c over here we'll call it a c1 minus and then we have two times and then the antiderivative or the indefinite integral of secant squared of x dx becomes tangent of x plus i'll call this a c2 but we have a constant and we have plus another constant so really what we can just do is just write it as one big constant because it doesn't really matter as long as it's a constant so simplifying this 10 over 5 gives you 2x to the fifth minus 2 tangent of x and then we just call it plus c so really you don't need to add a c1 and a c2 here we could have just said plus c now if we do another example and we take the integral from 0 to 3 of x cubed minus 6x dx this is a definite integral and so we're going to use the fundamental theorem of calculus as well as a table earlier in this video this equals and now we have we have two things and then we look at each one x to the third and six times x and so what we get is the x to the third becomes x to the fourth over four minus and then six x is six times and then x is x squared over two and then this is all going to be evaluated from zero to three okay so i so again we took this and split it up into two things x to the third becomes x to the four plus four six x is six times x squared over two and we don't have a plus c because it's a definite integral so we know exactly the values 3 and 0 the bounds so this becomes 3 to the 4 over 4 minus 6 well 6 over 2 is really this 6 over 2 really should just be a 3x squared so minus 3 times squared minus and then we get zero to the four over four minus three times zero squared so we're left with is going to be 81 over 4 minus 27 and well that's just 6.75 now if we did another example and we were to find the integral from 0 to 12 of x minus 12 times sine of x dx what we get here is well the integral of x gives you x squared over 2 minus 12 times the integral of sine of x well the integral of sine of x is going to be negative cosine of x and then this is going to be evaluated from 0 to 12. so what we get is the following we get 12 squared over 2 minus 12 times cosine or negative cosine of 12. minus zero squared over two minus twelve times negative cosine of zero and i guess these minus negatives can cancel and they can just be become a plus cosine of zero well that's just one so this becomes 12 squared over two we get 72 plus 12 times cosine of 12 and then we get minus well that's just 0 that cancels out and so we get minus 12. and so we're left with 60 plus 12 times cosine of 12. the last thing we're going to do today is something called the net change theorem and this says that the integral of a rate of change is the net change meaning the integral from a to b of f prime of x dx and this is f of b minus f a and so an example of this might be if we're dealing with the volume in the tank with respect to some time t and we say that vt is the volume coming in first the rate the water moves in water flows in then the change in amount of water of water in the tank is going to be the integral from some time 1 to time 2 of the derivative of v of t dt and that's really just v of t 1 minus v of t2 this works for a bunch of different things for example if we have velocity versus position the change in position s2 s of t2 minus s of t1 is just the integral of the velocity today we're going to talk about the substitution rule now because of the fundamental theorem of calculus it's important to know the antiderivatives but sometimes the antiderivatives we don't really know for example if we have the integral of 2x times the square root of 1 plus x squared dx what's the antiderivative of this well we don't know that antiderivative just yet but we can look at this and look at this 2x and then the square root of 1 plus x squared and we can make a little substitution what if we introduce this new variable u and let u be what's inside the square root 1 plus x squared well what's the derivative of u d u is going to be 2x times dx and so this original integral if i move it down here that if i rearranged it and i move this 2x after the square root we get the integral of the square root of one plus x squared times 2x dx and now we can make some substitutions so this is the integral the square root of 1 plus x squared well we know 1 plus x squared from right here is going to be u and then 2x dx right here is d u so this becomes the square root of u times du or if you prefer as an exponent u to the one half d u and now we know what this antiderivative is the antiderivative of this is twothirds u to the threehalves plus c but remember u we made that substitution we defined u to be one plus x squared so really putting it back into x because our original actually i'll just write it up here so this is going to be two thirds u was one plus x squared raised to the 3 halves plus c that is our answer so this method that we did right here is using substitution so we have something called the substitution rule this says that if u is equal to some g of x is a differentiable function whose range is an interval we'll see this interval call it i and f is continuous on i then the integral of f of g of x times g prime of x dx is equal to the integral of f of u d u so basically what this is saying is if we're taking the integral of some function f that of some variable times the derivative of that that could be written as the integral of f of udu so instead of writing it as g of x we're writing it as u and this all becomes that so let's do an example let's evaluate the integral of x squared times cosine of x cubed dx if we rewrote this and we move these x squared after the cosine so this would be the integral of cosine of x cubed times x squared dx now this x cubed inside the cosine that might be causing little problems so that's the that's probably what we're going to want to let our u equals let u be x cubed that means that d u is going to be 3 times x squared times dx and so making the substitution we get the integral of cosine instead of x cubed we're going to use u but now we run into a problem this is x squared dx and this is not quite x squared dx it's 3 times x squared dx well how do we make it like x squared dx we can divide both sides by 3. and so one third d u is equal to x squared dx so this is going to be multiplied by one third d u so to evaluate this this one third we can pull it in front and so this is one third the integral of cosine of u d u and we know this so we get 1 3 times sine of u the antiderivative of cosine is sine and then we add plus c but we're not done because the initial problem had x's in it we cannot leave our answer with u we have to always write back or convert back so this is going to be 1 3 sine our u was x cubed plus c that's our answer now let's do another example let's evaluate the integral the square root of 2x plus 1 dx so here we look inside the square root and because it has more than just x we're going to have a problem so that's what we're going to let our substitution be let u equal 2x plus 1. then our derivative d u the derivative of 2x plus 1 is just 2 times dx because the derivative of 2x is just 2 derivative of 1 is 0. so it's just 2 and then times dx so going ahead making the substitution this is the integral of the square root of u but again we only have just dx so to get just dx we divide both sides by two and so dx is just one half d u so times one half d u so we get one half times the integral of square root of u or rather u to the one half d u i'm going to write it as an exponent and so the antiderivative or the integral of u to the one half d u is going to be two thirds u to the three halves plus c and so this becomes one third u to the three halves plus c and u we said was two x plus one so this is one third times two x plus one all raised to the three halves plus c that's your answer now let's do another example but very similar evaluate the integral of x times the square root of two x plus one dx so this is similar to the last problem except now we have an x in front so we'll make this the substitution u is equal to 2x plus 1 just like we did before and du is going to be 2 dx which means that our dx is really one half d u so this becomes the the integral of well i'll leave that x for now the square root of u times one half d u so we're stuck with this x what can we do with this x we'll take a look at what we said over here u is two x minus one so if we rearrange that term so if we rearrange this we could solve for x and so if we subtracted one from both sides we get u minus one is 2x or if we divide by 2 we get x is u minus 1 over 2. so making that substitution we now get the integral and rather than having it u minus one over two i'll write it as one half times u minus one okay so we get one half u minus one square root of u is u to the one half and then times one half d u we have onehalf and onehalf we can pull that in front so we'll get onefourth times the integral and i'm going to go ahead and just distribute this u times u to the onehalf becomes u to the three halves minus one times u to the one half is just u to the one half and then times d u so this is something that we will be able to solve so this is going to be 1 4 times the antiderivative of u to the three halves well that's going to be two fifths u to the five halves minus twothirds u to the threehalves plus c and again we know that u was two x plus one so this is going to be one fourth times the quantity two fifths times two x plus one to the five halves minus two thirds times two x plus one to three halves plus c now let's do an example evaluate the integral of cosine of 5x dx so we let u equal 5x then d u is going to be 5 dx so this is going to be the integral of cosine of u times and so if we just have a dx then we can write dx is going to be one fifth d u so times one fifth d u so we have one fifth the integral cosine of u d u which is onefifth the integral of cosine of udu is just sine of u plus c and so substituting u is equal to 5x this is 1 5 sine of 5x plus c let's do another example evaluate the integral of the square root of one plus one plus x squared all times x to the fifth dx so we make u equal 1 plus x squared then d u is 2x dx and so we get this is the integral of the square root of u and now we have x to the fifth dx well going back to this d u if we divide both sides by u or by two we get one half d u is x dx and so x to the fifth can be rewritten as x to the 4 times x dx x to the 4 times x is x to the fifth and so we get the integral of the square root of u times x to the 4 x dx is one half d u but we're still left with x to the four but remember that we let u be one plus x squared so x squared is going to be u minus one we just moved one to the other side if x squared is u minus one x to the four is x squared squared so u minus one quantity squared is x to the four and so now this is going to be and i'm going to rewrite the square root of u as u to the one half so this is u to the one half times u minus one squared times one half d u we can pull that one half in front we get the integral of u to the one half i'm going to expand u minus one squared is u squared minus two u plus one d u this becomes u to the one half times two is going to be u to the five halves minus 2 u to the one half times u is u to the three halves plus u to the one half d u and so now we can actually start taking the antiderivative or integrating so this is one half times this is going to be two sevenths u to the seven halves minus two times twofifths u to the fivehalves plus twothirds u to the threehalves all plus c and so writing this out remember u was up here i've got to go back up a little bit u was 1 plus x squared so this is going to be equal to onehalf times twosevenths is going to be well in fact this half will cancel that two cancels this two and it cancels this two so that'd be one seventh this next term would be twofifths and this would just be onethird so we get 1 7 oops not u we're substituting and so we said u is equal to 1 plus x squared so 1 plus x squared raised to the seven halves minus two fifths one plus x squared raised to the five halves plus one third one plus x squared raised to the 3 halves and plus c now we have the substitution rule for the definite integrals and this says the following if g prime is continuous on a to b and f is continuous on the range of u equaling g of x then the integral from a to b of f of g of x times g prime of x dx is equal to the integral and now here's where we're going to make a change if we're going to be changing uh from to you our bounds from a to b also have to change so our a instead of going from a it's going to go from g of a instead of going to b it goes to g of b and then we have f of u d u so we'll do an example evaluate the integral from 0 to 4 of the square root of 2x plus 1dx so we're going to make substitution we're going to let u equal 2x plus 1 and d u is equal to 2 dx and then now when we had or initially that x was going from zero and x went to four what we're going to do is we're going to plug in those values into our u so if it went from zero the new value is going to go two times zero plus one which is equal to one and then it will go to two times four plus one which would be nine so instead of going from zero to four it goes from zero to four it'll go from one to nine so now we have this is the integral from 1 to 9 of the square root of u and then dx well we knew from the other video 2 du equals two x that means that dx is one half d u so here we have one half the integral from one to nine of u to the one half d u and so this becomes onehalf times the antiderivative of u to the onehalf is twothirds u to the threehalves evaluated from one to nine for onehalf and two cancels so this is onethird u to the threehalves evaluated from one to nine which becomes one third nine to the three halves minus one to the three halves so this is one third nine to the three halves is going to be 27 minus one and so this is 26 over three so this is one way of solving these definite integrals and some of you may find this confusing having to change from zero to four to one to nine there is an alternate way of solving this so the way i'm going to solve this is going to be the following we have the integral from 0 to 4 of the square root of 2x plus 1 dx and then we made the substitution for u so this is the integral of the square root of u times one half d u now notice i'm not putting our bounds in okay and this is the same substitution we had before where u was two x plus one and then d u is 2 dx so that's the same substitution we did before and now so this is the integral of u to the onehalf and actually i can bring it one half integral u to the one half d u which is one half times two thirds u to the three halves right here and we're supposed to evaluate it from something to something and we didn't we didn't make that change but this is because we're dealing with you now if we instead of dealing with u we converted back to x so we have this is one third instead of u to the three halves we have two x plus one to the three halves we can evaluate it back to our original thing which was zero to four our original value was zero to four so we don't have to convert it like how we did before from one to nine we can leave it and so now this becomes onethird times uh two times four is eight well two times four plus one raised to the three halves minus one third times two times zero plus one raised to the three halves and this is going to be onethird nine to the threehalves minus onethird times one to the halves and so this should give us nine to the three halves is going to be 27 times one third so 27 over three minus one third which is 26 over 3 and that's exactly the same answer we got from up here you can see 26 over 3. so there are two different ways of doing it this first way we had to convert from zero to four to one to nine and we just made that substitution by plugging in for u the second way of doing this is instead of having to change your your variables we just went back so instead of changing the limits of integration we went back and writing it instead of u we put it back in terms of x and then we could keep our original limits of integration so now let's do another example with a definite integral let's evaluate the integral from one to two of dx over three minus five x squared we're probably going to want to let u equal 3 minus 5x and that means that du is going to be negative 5 dx and so this becomes the integral of well dx should be negative onefifth d u so this should be negative 1 5 d u divided by the square root uh not excuse me not the square root the square of u so u squared and now our limits of integration if we started off where x was one our new limit would be three minus five times one which is 3 minus 5 or negative 2 so we're going to be at negative 2 and then if x was 2 so we're going from 1 to 2 the u would become three minus five times two which is going to be negative seven so we're gonna have the integral from negative two to negative seven of negative one fifth d u over u squared so it doesn't really look too pretty the way it is so let's pull out the negative one fifth negative one fifth integral from negative two to negative seven and dividing by u squared let's write it as u to the negative two d u now this looks a little cleaner this becomes negative one the integral of negative of u to the negative two is going to be negative one well negative u to the negative one and then we're gonna evaluate that from negative two to negative seven so we have this is going to be negative well negative negative will cancel so it's going to be just positive onefifth of negative seven to the negative one minus onefifth of negative two to the negative one so here we have onefifth times negative one over seven and then plus because again another negative negative onefifth times one over two they both have a onefifth so we'll factor out onefifth then we have negative oneseventh plus onehalf so we get one fifth times the common denominator would be fourteen so this would be two over fourteen plus seven over fourteen negative two over fourteen plus seven over fourteen gives us five over fourteen so we get one fifth times five over fourteen our fives cancel and we finally end up with our answer 1 over 14. now recall what it means if a function is even so you might recall from algebra or precalculus that an even function is something that's symmetric about the yaxis so it might be something that looks like something like that and pretend that's symmetric but or even let's just say a simple parabola that's going to be symmetric about the axis function that's odd is something that might look like this and remember we can graph an odd function by taking one of these quadrants reflecting it over the xaxis and then reflecting it again over the yaxis to get that now the definition for something to be even versus odd is that if if we plug in negative x into our function f of x it comes out to just being the same thing and it's odd if we plugged in negative x and we ended up with negative of our function so this is what it means to be odd and even in the context of integration this becomes useful if you're integrating an even function and instead of going from say like negative this part to this part you only need to calculate half of this half of that and then multiply it by two and then for an odd function if we're calculating something and the width is even or it's like negative one value to another the area under here is going to be positive but then you go down here and that area would be negative and it cancels out that's only for evaluating from the exact same value so from like negative 2 to positive 2 or negative 10 to positive 10. so let's actually write this up formally so integrals of symmetric functions and this would say the following suppose f is continuous on the interval negative a to a and then first thing if f is even then we have the integral from negative a to a of f of x dx this is just twice the integral from 0 to a of f of x dx an even function so we only need to do half of it and then multiply it by 2. and if f is odd then we have the integral from negative eight to a of f of x dx that is equal to zero and just the reminder what it means to be even that means f of negative x f of negative x is f of x and what it means to be odd is f of negative x equals negative f of x so an example is since the function f of x equals x to the sixth is even and we can test that uh test it so f of negative x is going to be negative x to the sixth which is just x to the sixth which is f of x so since this is even we have that the integral from negative 2 to 2 of x to the 6 dx is going to be twice the integral from 0 to 2 of x to the 6 dx which is going to be twice the antiderivative of x to the sixth or the integral of x to the sixth dx becomes one over seven x to the seventh evaluated from zero to two and so this is going to be 256 over seven minus zero so it's just 256 over seven and then another example since f of x is equal to tangent of x divided by one plus x squared plus x to the four this is going to be odd and why is it odd well f of negative x is going to be tangent of negative x divided by 1 plus negative x quantity squared plus negative x quantity to the four now tangent we know is already odd if you recall from the graph of a tangent tangent looks like that in fact it repeats on and on but now since tangent is odd then what we have is this is equal to negative tangent of x divided by one plus x squared plus x to the four and this is negative of this whole thing so this is just negative f of x so now we know it's odd so we have that the integral from negative 1 to 1 of tangent of x divided by 1 plus x squared plus x to the 4 dx because it's an odd function this integral is just 0. today we're going to talk about the areas between curves so let's say we have a curve that might look like this we'll call this curve f this is our function f of x and let's say we have another curve that lies below the axis and that's our curve g now to find the area under the curve let's say from some point a to b the area under f this area we already know how to find that and if we do approximations we can approximate by using rectangles or when we take the limit as it goes to infinity we can use integration same thing if it lies below the axis down here we can use a bunch of rectangles and when it's below the axis axis the area is going to be negative or we can also use integration so finding the total area between these two regions we really want to find the difference we want to find this area above and remember if this is below it's going to be negative so we want to add these two and so if we're adding a positive number and the negative number really what we're finding is f minus g so the formula for the area will be given by the following so area is equal to let me make this a little bit bigger font area is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n of the difference of f of x sub i star minus g of x of i star all times our delta x delta x there we go okay so this looks familiar if we didn't have this minus g but this looks familiar the limit of the sum of f of x sub i star times delta x now so this is one equation for the area and another equation is going to be given with the following the area we'll call this a of the region bounded by the curves y equals f of x and y is equal to g of x and the lines x equals a and x equals b so we're going to be between this curve and this curve down here and oops in between the vertical line and this vertical line this is going to be where f and g are continuous and we're going to have to assume that the f of x function is going to be the top function so that's going to be greater than or equal to g of x so in this case order matters the top number has to be greater than the not the bottom number so f of x is greater than g of x and this is going to be for all x in the interval from a to b so this is given by the formula a equals the integral from a to b of f of x minus g of x times dx so this is what we're going to use and it doesn't have to always be above or below but you might have your two functions let's say this is the function f and the function g looks like this f and g are both going to be above the axis if we're going from a to b this is the area underneath and you can find that area using this formula now let's do an example find the area bounded by the two curves let's just call it say between the two curves y equals 2 minus x squared and that's a parabola and the line y equals negative x so here i didn't give you where what function to go from where to where so we actually have to figure that out so let's go ahead and plot what we have this first function is going to be a parabola and it's a parabola that goes up here at 2 and it's facing downwards so something like that then we have a straight line with a negative slope a slope of negative one and so we have that and then it crosses at the origin so we want to find the area between these two curves which is going to be this region right here so this is going to tell us that this top curve that's going to be the function we'll call f so that's the parabola so our f is going to be 2 minus x squared and then this straight line is going to be our j function and that's going to be negative x so now we know our curve which one is going to be f and which one is g but we still don't know the regions but we can figure that out so when are these two functions equal to each other so you get 2 minus x squared equals negative x you set them equal to each other and you can solve i'm going to move everything to the right side so if i add x squared add x squared and then i also subtract 2 and subtract 2. we get is on the left x squared minus x minus 2 and we can now factor x minus 2 times x plus 1. and so we get x is equal to negative 1 and x is equal to 2. and so that's the points negative 1 and 2. so the area is going to be the integral from negative 1 to 2 of your f function your top function which is 2 minus x squared minus your bottom function which is negative x so the integral of 2 minus x squared minus negative x and this is going to be all times dx so now we can solve this definite integral this is going to be the integral from negative 1 to 2 of let's say 2 minus x squared and minus a negative x gives you plus x and all dx so go ahead and finding the integral of this the antiderivative of two is just two x the antiderivative of x squared is onethird x cubed and the antiderivative of x is one half x squared and we're going to evaluate it from negative one to two so we get evaluating at two we get 2 times 2 minus 1 3 times 2 cubed plus 1 half times 2 squared minus 2 times negative 1 minus onethird times negative one cubed plus onehalf times negative one squared so we get four minus eight thirds and then one half times two squared so one half times four or just plus two and then we get minus and negative so we get oh we'll just do this so two times negative one negative two and then negative one cubed is still negative one but minus one half becomes plus one half and then plus another one half so we get six minus eight thirds and in fact this should have been a three so sorry about that that should be a three so six minus eight thirds because i combined those to make six and then we're going to subtract and then we'll have uh negative two plus onethird plus onehalf five over six and so we get is going to be 6 minus 8 over 3 fact i'm instead of writing 8 over 3 i'm going to write 16 over 6. i just multiplied it by two over two so we can have a common denominator plus two minus five over six so now we our six plus two will give us eight minus we get 21 over 6 and that 21 over 6 they both have a 3 in it so we can reduce and that becomes 7 over 2 and if we want to combine that into just a single fraction it would be 9 halves so that's the area between the two curves we'll do another example find the area bounded between the two curves y equals the square root of x and y is equal to x minus 2. so again we're not really given much here so we're going to have to figure out what this region looks like so the first graph y equals the square root of x looks something like this this is y is equal to the square root of x and then the straight line y is equal to x minus two that's going to be a straight line at negative two with a slope maybe something like that and just for sake let's also add another stipulation and this region will also be bounded below by the x axis so now we're not going to look at this part below we're going to be restricted by the xaxis this line and then y equals square root of x and so this right here was y is equal to x minus 2. so this problem is a little different from the other one because we're actually going to break this up into two separate pieces the first piece is going to be right here and this is going to be between two curves we're going to be between this upper curve and this lower curve then the other piece is just going to be this little piece right here and this is bounded above by the square root of x and that's it when you just take the integral of the square root or just the integral it's the area below that curve and above the axis so all we need to do is figure out what are these points where does it cross well the graph y equals negative or x minus 2 excuse me it crosses the axis right here when x is equal to 2. so we know that point but then to find this other point that's when we're going to have x minus 2 equals the square root of x so we need to figure out when they're going to be equal well we have a square root of x that's really not something we like so let's actually square both sides so we get x squared minus 4x plus 4 equals x moving x to the other side we get x squared minus 5x plus 4 equals 0 or x minus 4 times x minus 1 equals 0 and so we're going to get two values we're going to get x is equal to 1 or x is equal to 4. this value x equals 1 is an an extra root that comes out when we end up squaring it and you can look just look at the graph one does not work so we we ignore that and then we look at this point so this is going to be right there for the green region we're going to have an integral between the two points two and four and then for the blue region we'll have just an integral from zero to two right so area for the blue is just the area under the curve so that's the integral from 0 to 2 of the square root of x dx or the integral from zero to two of x to the onehalf dx which is twothirds x to the threehalves evaluated from zero to two this comes up to just being twothirds times two to the threehalves minus twothirds times zero to the threehalves or twothirds times eight the green region our area is going to be the integral from two to four of the top function which is the square root of x minus the bottom function which is x minus 2 dx and so we're going to go ahead and we'll rewrite this this is an integral from two to four of x to the one half minus x plus two dx which is going to be twothirds x to the threehalves minus onehalf xsquared plus two x evaluated from two to four and so we get two thirds times four to the three halves minus one half times four squared plus two times four subtracted by twothirds times two to the threehalves minus onehalf times two squared plus two times two and then if we were to go ahead and simplify this i'll tell you right now that that is equal to negative two so the total area is going to be the area plus blue or of the blue plus the area of the green so our total area between the two curves is going to be 16 thirds plus negative 2 which is ten thirds that is the area between the two curves right here so now we know how to find the area between two curves when you have one curve f and that's above another curve g but now what if we have say our curve f looks like this as if we're going between two points like a and b a and b and we had a curve g that starts off below and then it goes above and then maybe even below again so if we're going between a and b we're going to have a couple of different regions we have this region where it's sub where f is above so we call that's our g function and another region where f is above but in this region down here where g is above so how do we really do something like this when you have when it switches so in this case we knew what happened when f was above g but when they alternate what we're going to do is the following just simply break it up into different pieces we'll have this one red piece right here and maybe i'll make this other one over here red as well and then we'll have make this one blue okay and then you just figure out where these points are and you do three separate you figure out where each of these intersections are and you just calculate three separate integrals each integral the you're going to make sure you've got to figure out the top function versus the bottom function the top function versus the bottom and so forth now we might also have some sort of curve that's instead of y equaling a function of x will have the other way around x is a function of y so what that might look like would be we might have something like this and then this would be the curve x is equal to g of x excuse me x is equal to g of y and maybe something that looks like this and this is going to be x is f of y these are functions in terms of y and if you want to find the area between these two curves let's say between some point c and some point d so we want to find this area we're going to integrate so area would be the integral from c to d but instead of it being a function of x it would be a function of y f of y minus g of y d y and so we'll do an example to illustrate why this might be useful find the area enclosed by the line y is equal to x minus 1 and the parabola y squared is equal to two x plus six what does this look like well we have a parabola y squared equals two x plus six that's a problem that faces that opens to the right something like this and then y equals x minus 1 that's a line that goes something like that so now to find the area in between here what we'd have to do would be to figure out these points of intersections so we're going to have this equation y squared equals 2x plus 6 and then using the first equation that said y is equal to x minus 1 solving for x we get x is y plus one we'll solve we'll substitute so we get y squared is two times y plus one plus six or y squared is two y plus 2 plus 6. so 2y plus 8 or y squared minus 2y minus 8 equals 0 then you get y minus 4 and y plus 2 equals 0 and so we know that it goes from down here where y is negative 2. so we get our answer is y is negative 2 and y is 4. all the way up to up here where y is 4. so now to find this area we're going to get that the area is equal to the integral where y goes from negative 2 to 4 of our upper function so now looking here we need to figure out what's the upper function so if you sort of like tilt your head sideways this is the yaxis so the upper function goes out this way so this is our upper function and then this is our lower function so it's just like how we did with a regular function but just sideways so we get our upper function is the straight line and the equation for the straight line is going to be well it's what we need to do because remember we're we're writing it as x is like a function of y and then x was like a function g of y so what we need to do is we need to write them in terms of x of just y's so actually i'm going to move up a little bit more so we could see the initial equations we had them right here so i had written this first one the straight line but the parabola that needs to be rewritten let's move that over here so we want to just solve it for x we're going to get 2x is equal to y squared minus 6. i move six over and then if i divide everything by two we get x is equal to one half y squared minus three that's what we're going to substitute back into here so a is going to be well the straight line comes first so the straight line is going to be y plus 1 minus the parabola which is one half y squared minus three times d y giving myself a little bit more room go ahead and this is going to be the integral from negative 2 to 4 of y and then can combine the 1 and 3 minus the negative 3 so that will give us plus 4 minus 1 half y squared all times d y and so now integrating we get one half y squared plus 4y minus 1 6 y cubed evaluated from negative two to four plugging in the limits of integration we get one half times four squared plus four times four minus 1 6 times 4 cubed minus 1 half times negative 2 squared plus 4 times negative 2 minus 1 6 times negative 2 cubed simplifying this we end up with 18 and that's the area today we're going to talk about volumes now we already know how to find the area between two curves let's say we have a curve like this and we have another curve like that so this first curve we'll call that f the second curve we'll call it g so we can find this area between those two curves by calculating the integral of f minus g between those two points but now what about if we had something we'll start off the shape like this a cylinder how would you find the volume of the cylinder well the volume of the cylinder is just going to be base times height just like the volume of a box you take volume if this is your height and the cylinder has a radius r the volume is going to be the base pi r squared times your height and so we can do that if even if we don't have a circle as a as a base you could have some kind of weird shape like this we can figure that out we can figure out that volume in fact let's say we had some sort of volume that kind of got bigger like this and like bigger like that and cut one end like this and then the end is circularish but maybe not necessarily quite a circle a little bit off but it because it doesn't have to be an exact circle well what we can do is we keep taking slices across so we'll sort of like slice it with a little plane and when we slice it across we'll see there's a cross section and that would be what our base is and so we just go through this and so we'll have the following definition of the volume based off of this so definition of the volume we'll say let s be this is a capital s so let capital s be a solid so not something that's hollow but solid that lies between x equals a and x equals b if the cross section the cross sectional area of s in the plane we'll say p sub x so in the plane of the x direction so this means it goes through x and perpendicular perpendicular to the xaxis is a of x where a is a continuous function so we have this then the volume of s is the following we have v is equal to and so just like before we'd have the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum where i goes from 1 to n i goes from 1 to n of a of x sub i star times delta x which is equal to the integral from a to b of your cross sectional area a of x dx so basically what we're doing each of these a of x is like a slice that's the area of a slice and so we're going to add up all these areas of the slices and so when whereas before when we found the area under curve and we added up all these straight lines because we started off with you know the area of the rectangle and it's got smaller and smaller we got these areas like this same thing let's just say if it was like a cylinder maybe not maybe just something getting bigger we add up one slice we'll add up another slice another another and so add adding up all these slices that's what we have so now let's do an example we're actually going to prove right now that the volume of a sphere is equal to four thirds pi r cubed you might remember this formula before but now we're going to show how we got this formula so if you look at a sphere we have so this is a three dimensional axes we have x y and then this would be z the sphere comes up like that but then if we looked at each little cross section what we have is we have circles circles circles and so forth and so the equation of each of these circles is x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared if we rearrange this solving for y we have y is equal to the square root of r squared minus x squared so we're really looking at one of these circles right here and then if these are our axes so that was the x1 and that was the y1 if we want to find the area of this circle we know area is pi r squared so just by looking at this right here the radius is this length y so your radius is really equal to y which is the y that we're writing up here so the area a of x is pi times y squared or a of x is going to be pi times the square root of r minus x squared squared so the square root squared just gives you r squared minus x squared now we have a function just in terms of x okay so now we're looking at here i remember that this big sphere had a radius of r so i went from negative r to positive r went down here from negative r to positive r and even on this axis negative r to positive r so for computing the volume the volume is equal to the integral and since we're dealing with x because our function is going to be in terms of x is going to be the integral of a of x dx now what values did x go from x went from negative r to positive r so we're going to be integrating throughout all of that so making the substitution for a of x we get the integral from negative r to positive r of pi times r squared minus x squared times dx and so integrating what we get since pi is a constant we can pull that in front so that would be pi times the integral from negative r to r of the quantity r squared minus x squared dx now you may notice this function right here is even and if you did notice that then we can use the property that this since we're going from negative r to r it's just going to be twice the integral from 0 to r of r squared minus x squared dx if you didn't notice that you can still integrate it normally but sometimes integrating with zero as one of the limits can be a little easier so integrating we get this is going to be 2 pi times the antiderivative of r squared is x times r squared and the antiderivative of x squared is 1 3 x cubed and we're going to go from 0 to r so we get this is 2 pi times when we evaluate it at r it's going to be x times r squared or r times r squared gives you r cubed minus 1 3 r cubed and then when we put 0 in it'll be 0 minus 0. so this is going to be two pi times r cubed minus one third r cubed gives you two thirds r cubed and so this finally gives you four thirds pi r cubed and this is the formula that we know for the volume of a sphere now let's do another example say we want to find the volume created or that's bounded by the lines y equals x cubed y equals eight and x equals zero and then we're gonna revolve this or rotate it about the yaxis okay so first of all let's draw what this figure looks like so we have y equals x cubed that's a cubic function something like that we have y equals eight so we have something like this and then we have x equals zero which is that right there so we have this right here and then think about rotating it about so we'll have something like that a bunch of circles like rotate it about and the object looks something like this so each of these circles that we're going to have each of these circles has its own radius if this is the line y equals x cubed the radius here each of these radiuses are going to be the x value so from this equation above y equals x cubed we can get that x is equal to y to the one third power or the cube root of y so now we're dealing with something in terms of y so our area our cross sectional area is going to be a of y and we know that's going to be pi times the radius squared or pi times x squared or pi times since we know x is from here y to the one third is going to be y to the onethird squared or pi times y to the two thirds so that's the formula for a of y therefore we get for our volume volume is going to be the integral from well what we're going to have it a of y times d y so the limits of integration your y goes from zero all the way up to eight so we're taking the integral from zero to eight therefore substituting our a in we get volume is the integral from zero to eight of pi times y to the two thirds d y and now we can integrate this we get y times the anti or x sorry pi times the antiderivative of y to the two thirds which is going to be threefifths y to the fivethirds evaluated from zero to eight so we get three pi over five times eight to the five thirds minus zero to the five thirds and zero to the five thirds is just zero last step what is eight to the five thirds well this is really eight to the one third to the fifth so eight to the one third is going to be two two to the fifth so we have that's 32 and so therefore this is equal to 3 pi over 5 times 32 or 96 pi over 5.
