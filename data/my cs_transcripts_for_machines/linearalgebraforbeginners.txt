okay so welcome to the first lecture on the vectors course this is the basics vectors versus scalars vector notation addition and scaling and properties alright so begin at the beginning let's list some scalar quantities think about mass duration length temperature charge these physical quantities are all well described with a single number really they just have a magnitude although some of them may go negative so it's a magnitude and a sign but still just a simple number is adequate to describe these things how about vector quantities what what's different about vector quantities well think about these things force velocity and therefore acceleration or momentum these things also have a strength or a magnitude however so let's put that down they have a magnitude however they also have a direction more than just a sign they have a full on direction in threedimensional space so it's not enough to know that a force is three Newtons I want to know in which direction is that force applied and that then is the difference between a vector and a scalar quantity we're going to think about how we manipulate them all right so first off the notation that we're going to use when we talk about our vectors what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a symbol such as the letter A so let's write that out but I'm going to underline it so an underlined symbol indicates a vector rather than a simple number and when I need to specify that vector I'm going to write it we're going to be threedimensional I'm going to write the three numbers in a column form like this and now if you haven't seen a vector specified before what does it mean well think of the Cartesian axes the X the X Y z axes think in this case about coming out from the origin to in the direction of X and 1 in the direction of Y and 3 in the direction of said what we're going to do is we're going to think of our vector as an arrow an arrow that comes from the origin to this point in space and that arrow itself whether or not it comes from the origin that that direction and that length of arrow is our visualization of the vector so let me just change color to green and go ahead and draw the tip of my arrow there there we are so the vector is coming towards us out of the screen and it has those particular three components 1 3 other people may use other notations for example align over the the symbol a is commonly used when people write out the components that may choose to do it as a row like this or even using pointy brackets like this now all these notations are basically getting at the same thing you'll be able to read textbooks or look online and see these things and understand what they mean but within this course of videos we're just going to use the notation that I've introduced above so I'll erase those for now now the simplest thing that you might want to do if you have a couple of vectors is to add them up so let's think about that vector addition what does it mean so let's give ourselves a second vector B we'll make it 5 minus 2 0 let's say I want to add these two vectors together so we'll write that out I simply want to add a on the line plus B underline does that mean let's just substitute in 2 3 added on 2 5 minus 2 0 now what we do is we simply add the first component component of vector a to the first component of vector B and so on down the list very very simple so we're adding 2 plus 5 we're going to add 1 plus 2 and 3 plus 0 and we just tidy that up so that's going to be 7 and minus 1 and 3 now how about scaling a vector ok so what we can do is we can multiply a vector by a simple number and correspondingly we'll just end up multiplying each of its components so let's take an example 3 9 12 what we notice is each of the three components is a multiple of three we can just take that common factor out in front and write this instead as 3 times 1 3 minus 4 same thing alright or equivalently someone might give us a vector that's already written in this form it could be let's see 3 over 2 on 2 2 4 minus 4 let's make it one alright and we can just multiply that in in a component by component basis so we just write ourselves a new column of course 3 times 2 is 3 3 times minus 4 is minus 6 and 3 over 2 times 1 is 3 over 2 okay so there we are we can scale our vectors by a number in this simple way so with these definitions of addition and scaling can we say anything about the properties okay so if I have two regular numbers a and B then of course a plus B is the same as B plus a I'm not saying anything fancy here it's as simple as I don't know 7 plus minus 3 is equal to minus 3 plus 7 obviously it is we know that now if we think about the same statement for vectors a plus B vector B is it the same as vector B plus a well it must be let's just write at an example 7 0 minus 1 3 1 2 is it equal to 3 1 2 vector plus the vector 7 0 7 0 minus 1 of course it is because of the way we've defined vector addition as just being the addition of each element to the corresponding element and this property is called being commutative okay so vector addition is commutative how about this second example if we have three basic quantities ordinary numbers then if we have a plus B plus C it's the same as a plus B plus C it doesn't matter the order that we do them in is that going to be true for vectors well of course it is going to have to be true to fit vectors because the way we define vector addition is to add each component to the corresponding component it's just addition so this is also 4 vectors let's write out what we mean we mean that vector a plus B plus C as a previously worked out thing is equal to vector A plus vector B and then add on C it doesn't matter the order we do these things all right and there's a name for that property it's called being associative so all right so vector addition has that property also now let's thinking about our scaling property if we have ordinary numbers again then we could take some scale factor K and multiply it into a plus B and it would just give us K times a plus K times B again I'm not saying anything that isn't utterly obvious here say for example I don't know 2 into 1 plus 3 is equal to 2 times 1 plus 2 times minus 3 of course it is so how about for vectors is it true that some scale factor K times the sum vector A plus vector B a plus B and that's stress that this scale factor is just a pure number then yes indeed it's going to be just K times a plus K times B so just to just to stress what we're doing here let's copy down this sum of two vectors we were playing with up here this 7 zero minus one thing plus three one to put it inside curly brackets maybe for a variety doesn't have to be curly brackets multiply it by some factor let's have three over two had that before unimaginative there we are what are they going to be it's just gonna be three over two times the first vector seven zero 1 and then plus three over two times the second vector three one two okay so everything as you kind of would expect it works out it must and this latter property is called being distributed distributive excuse me so scaling is distributive over addition and that's the end of our first video welcome to the second of these videos we're going to look here at the vector dot product also called the scalar product we'll look at also the magnitude of a vector and the meaning of unit vectors the geometric meaning of the dot product and finding the angle between vectors using the dot product okay so the dot product is a way of combining two vectors in order to produce a number a simple number a scalar hence the alternate name scalar product let's give ourselves a couple of vectors let's have a will vector a can be four minus four let's have two one and we'll have a vector B which can be three one three and we're going to do the dot product of these two guys so we write that as vector a a nice a nice clear central dot vector B and then we write that out as the two column vectors and we need to understand how we compute the dot product and the answer is we're simply going to multiply each component by its opposite number and then add them up so we're going to multiply the first component minus 4 by 3 and then add that to the second component to multiply by its opposite number 1 and finally the third components 1 and 3 so that's minus 4 times 2 by 3 add it on to 2 times by 1 add it on to 1 times 2 by 3 so minus 12 plus 2 Plus 3 that's going to be minus minus 7 all right there's the dot product worked out pretty straightforward and of course as you can see it can be a minus number can be zero can be a positive number but it's a simple pure number okay so now let's see what happens if we do the dot product of a vector with itself let's do a dotted with itself so there's gonna be minus four to one dotted with minus four to one now of course because we're multiplying each component by itself that will always be a positive number 164 pop months four by minus 4 + 2 2 4 + 1 1 is 1 and so it's going to add up to 21 it must add up to a positive number it's made of three positive numbers summed I want to introduce a second vector called a hat it's related to a just by scaling it and we're gonna scale it by one over the square root of the earlier dot product with itself so 1 over square root 21 and then just 4 1 as before so it says the scaled version of a what's interesting about it well now let's see what happens if we take the dot product of a hat with a hat with itself so we're going to get 1 over square root of 21 times 1 over a square root of 21 which is 1 over 21 and then of course we're going to get a dotted with a the original dot product we did which is just 21 as we know so of course the dot product of a hat with itself is just 1 that means that a hat has a special property it's what's called a unit vector unity being of course a fancy word for the number 1 so when we scale a vector so that it when dotted with itself it comes out as 1 then it is a unit vector meanwhile in general for a vector the square root of the dot product with itself has the name magnitude this is the magnitude of a vector and it is also magnitude it is also the length of the arrow if we think in terms of a vector as a physical displacement an arrow that lives in threedimensional space then it would be the length of that arrow as you can see from Pythagoras okay now then a different thing the dot product between two vectors has an alternative definition which we can show is the same as the definition we've been using so far a dot B is also the magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B times cause of some angle and what is that angle it's actually just the angle between the two vectors between their directions so here I'm drawing a vector a going in one direction and almost in the opposite direction vector B and then the angle in question would be this angle that we see between the two vectors when we draw them coming from a common point of origin okay so it's important to understand then that this angle can be more than 90 degrees here's what it isn't here's a mistake that's sometimes made by people as they start to play with vectors they want the angle for some reason they want it to be less than 90 degrees so they try and contrive this by putting the vectors together in a way that will give them less than 90 degrees like this for example and then we could try and draw an angle between these two lines let's see like that shoes out red to show that it's not correct what we should have is the two vectors coming from a common origin then we see that the angle between them can be more or less than 90 degrees if it was exactly 90 degrees then of course the dot product would be 0 because cos of 90 is 0 that's has interesting consequences but right now let's work out the angle between a couple of vectors let's give ourselves a we'll make it 1 0 minus 1 and B we're going to make it 4 1 minus 1 and we'll do the dot product between those guys so first we'll work out the dot product actually let's make it minus 1 so it can be minus 1 0 minus 1 I think they'll come out better so we have minus 4 from minus 1 times 4 we have 0 times 1 is 0 and we have minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 so it's gonna be minus 3 for the total dot product between these two guys but we also need to find out the magnitude fair enough my tangent of a is gonna be the square root of minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 and again 1 so that would be the square root of 2 nice straightforward meanwhile the magnitude of B is going to be 4 4 6 plus one plus one it's gonna be 18 the square root of 18 but I think we can do better than that square root of 18 is actually square root of 9 times the square root of 2 and that means it's 3 times the square root of 2 okay now we've got everything we need let's pull down a copy of that that definition they're relating a dot B to its magnitudes in the angle and fill in what we know for this particular choice of a and B we've got minus 3 is therefore equal to root 2 times 3 root 2 times cos of the angle that we're after so now we just need to rearrange that means that cos of the angle is going to be 2 equal to minus 3 divided by well we've got 2 lots of root 2 so stress mere 3 times 2 and if we simplify that down it's just me minus 1/2 now we may just remember oil so use a calculator to find out this means that the angle in question is in fact going to be simply 120 degrees or you can use radians if you prefer radians so there we are that's the answer the angle between these two vectors 120 degrees and that's it for the second video in this video we're going to see how to calculate something called the cross product of two vectors it's also called the vector product because the output is a new vector and we'll see how to test that the answer is correct so here I've written a cross B is equal to C and notice that the symbol for the cross product is just the multiplication symbol that you're familiar with from basic arithmetic I've given the vector a a particular form this two three four column vector and similarly B is written as four five six so we're going to go ahead and find out what is the cross product of these two vectors C because it's a vector we'll need to do some working for each of the three components now what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste up some arm some structure to help us work through the problem so don't worry because there's gonna look like a lot but you don't need to write all this out every time you want to do a cross product I'm just putting it here so we can really spell out the process okay so let's go ahead and work out the first component of the output vector C strangely enough what we're going to do is we're going to ignore the first component of vectors a and B so I'm just going to cross those out those aren't used and what we're going to do is we're going to multiply a certain of the other components what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the second component of vector a with the third component of vector B I call that the falling diagonal because when we draw it like this we start high and then go low and then we're going to subtract off the multiple of the rising diagonal four and six here the last component of vector a and the middle component of vector B so what we have here is 21 that seven threes a 216 fours are 24 that's minus three we can go ahead now and write that in as our first our 3 now let's move to the second element of the output vector C again we'll start by ignoring the second component of the to source vectors a and B we can cross those off and again we are going to multiply some diagonals but what's different here is we start with the rising diagonal 4 times 5 the last component of vector a times the first component of vector B the rising diagonal 5 4 2 20 and then we subtract off the falling diagonal so 2 7 to 14 and that's going to give us 6 so we can put that in now let's move to the third and final component as before we start by noting that we will ignore the third component of the to source vectors and we're going to need some diagonals it's the same pattern as the first falling diagonal first so 2 times 6 and subtract which is 12 and then subtract off the rising diagonal five threes of 15 all right so that's going to be 3 pop that in we see that we have quite a simple vector here there's a common factor of 3 let's bring that out 3 then minus 1 2 minus 1 that is our vector C that is a cross B notice again the pattern it was the falling diagonal minus the rising diagonal for the first component and then the rising diagonal minus the falling diagonal for the second component and then for the third it was back to the same pattern as for the first now these look a bit like letters to me they look a bit like a V the middle one perhaps an N and the final one a V I like to remember that as a little sentence which is vowels never vary because in my opinion vowels don't vary very much his evolved this one doesn't vary at all because it's stuffed in a museum however if you compare it to some other vowels which I found these on the internet I think they are all pretty much identical and it see a big difference there so for me voles never vary if for you they do seem to vary then think of a different way of remembering it but the important thing is that the first thing is the falling diagonal and then subtract the rising diagonal of V shape and it alternates okay how to check your cross product has been worked out correctly this is really useful stuff so let's give ourselves another example we have two three one and then we'll have let's say three seven minus one is get a minus in there and that's going to be equal to something we'll work it out in a minute for now I'll put X Y Zed now how am I going to test once I found those x y&z that I haven't made some kind of slip I mean there's a lot of mental arithmetic if we don't write it all out we're gonna be doing a bunch of multiplications I could easily slip up how am I gonna test that it turns out there's a very interesting property of the vector C that we get out after the operation if we've done it correctly that is as I've written here that a dot dot product with vector C is zero and so is B so either of the input vectors a and B dotted with the correct cross product C should give us zero and that's great because the dot product is very easy to work out even by eye as a check let's go ahead and do it so I've copied it down here we're going to want to work down our various components let's do the first component of C so what do we do we ignore the first components of a and B and we do the falling diagonals that's going to be three times minus one and we subtract the rising diagonals one times seven such as just let's just write that out normally I wouldn't bother to write all this out but let's go ahead and do it as minus three minus seven and so that's going to be minus ten as our first component now we work out second component we ignore the second component on the input vectors will do the rising diagonal one times three and subtract the falling diagonal two times minus one so what have we got we've got three here minus minus 2 and so that's going to give us five and then finally the third component ignore the third component of the input vectors do the falling diagonal 2 times 7 7 2 2 14 subtract the rising diagonal three threes and 9 so we're going to have for our final component 14 minus 9 which is another 5 aha so that's quite a simple vector has a common factor of 5 in there if we wanted to write it out that way now let's test that guy versus the a and B vectors to see if it passed passes our test or have we made a slip so let's just be completely explicit about that we're going to start by testing the dot product of the vector a with our hopefully correct that cross product C I'll write it out two three one dot product 10 5 5 what's that going to be equal to minus 20 and then three fives of 15 and then one five is five aha it does equal zero that's correct that's a very very encouraging thing but for real thoroughness we're going to test the other one as well so this is B dot C let's check that out so that's three seven minus one dotted with again 10 5 5 this time is going to be minus minus 30 from three times minus ten and then 7 5 2 35 and minus 5 from the last element zero again aha so it has in fact passed both of our tests and we're not very confident that's correct this is a great test to do one word of warning though the one thing it won't pick up is if you've done your rising and falling diagonals in exactly the wrong way round by starting with the wrong pattern so do remember the VNV pattern and this test will check for any particular slips in your multiplications and that's the end of the video okay so in this short video I'm just going to look at four more examples of the cross product for practice and here they are okay so here's the first one we want the first element of this cross product so we ignore the first elements of the to source vectors we do the falling diagonal 3 times 0 that's 0 and we subtract the rising diagonal 7 times minus 1 that is minus 7 so we're subtracting minus 7 that means we'll get plus 7 so the first element here is NBS 7 ok so now we want the second element that means we ignore the second element of the to source factors we do however the rising diagonal first 70s 14 minus 1 times 0 0 so that's 14 so the second one was the rising diagonal first if you follow me and then finally to get the third component we ignore the third component of the source vectors and we do the falling diagonal 1 times minus 1 is minus 1 minus 3 to 6 so that is minus 7 okay so there's our solution 7 14 minus 7 but is that correct or have we made a slip it's a good time to check the old dot product tricked so if we call this a cross B equals C then we should find that if we do the dot product of one of the input vectors say B with C then it should be 0 let's check that 7 2 2 14 minus 1 times 14 is minus 14 0 times minus 7 is zero so that's 14 minus 14 is correct let's do the other one it's harder so 1 times 7 is 7 3 times 14 is 42 so that's 49 in total and then the final term here 7 7 2 49 but that was with a minus number so we've got in fact 14 8 49 minus 49 is 0 so another one of those dot products is correctly 0 so what we found out is that a dot C and B dot C are both equal to 0 as they must be so when very confident that we have the right cross product there let's do another one okay so we're going to want the first element so we ignore the first element of the to source vectors and we do eight threes are 83 24 2 x 2 so that's 22 let's do the next elements so we ignore the middle element so we do the rising diagonal 4 0 8 8 that's just going to be 0 and then finally we ignore the bottom elements and we do the falling diagonal the rising diagonal 1 minus 12 is minus 11 so there's our solution 22 0 minus 11 we notice we could take 11 out of that as a common factor that would make them the next stage very easy but let's just let's do it the hard way and do the dot product so 4 times 22 is 88 1 times 0 0 and minus 88 and actually pretty easy to confirm that 0 let's do the other one 1 times 22 is 22 3 times 0 and again 2 times minus 11 again 0 so that's fine that one's passed its checks as well onto the third one okay so this time I think I might take a common factor out just to show us doing that because I see that this 25 5 15 chap is going to lead to some pretty big numbers but maybe I don't need to do that I can just take the common factor of 5 out of the first vector we're calling it vector a so that's just 5 13 and then I go ahead and write vector B which can't be simplified is just 1 3 minus 2 will do this cross cross spot excuse me will do this cross product and then we'll put the factor of 5 in at the end that's fine to do it that way round okay so let's go ahead and write that out there's our factor of 5 and here's our cross product so the first element of our cross product we can or the first elements of the to source factors we do the falling diagonal that gives us a minus 2 we subtract the rising diagonal that's a minus 9 so that's minus 2 plus 9 that's going to give us a 7 and now the middle element we ignore the middle elements on the to source factors we do the rising diagonal this time gives us minus 3 we subtract the falling diagonal that gives us minus 10 which means we're gonna have to add on 10 so that's minus 3 plus 10 it's another 7 okay and then finally the third element we ignore the 3rd elements on the source factor we do the falling diagonal that's five threes of 15 and we subtract the rising diagonal one that's going to give us another 14 so in fact a really simple vector here cuz we could take out a factor of 7 if we want to but let's check those dot products do it before or after we take out the factor of 7 it's pretty easy that's gonna be 4 times 7 minus and minus 2 times 14 yes that goes to 0 let's do this one just quickly 35 and another 7 is 42 but minus 3 times 14 is exactly minus 42 so that one is also satisfied we've passed our checks that looks pretty good we can leave it like this or if we want we can take out that factor of 7 and do 35 times 1 1 2 very simple very nice back to there ok let's come here now come down to the bottom and look at the final one we notice is actually the cross product of a vector with itself it's the same vector here so what are we going to get well we can just easily enough work it out we ignore the first two elements and we do 4 + 2 times minus 4 and minus 4 times 2 so it's something minus itself that's just gonna give us a 0 obviously and let's keep going if we ignore the middle terms and do the rising diagonal minus the falling diagonal again threes and minus 4s the same product so something minus itself 0 and it's gonna be the same for the final element so the cross product of a vector with itself is always going to be the zero vector now it's important not to write that just as the scalar 0 because it is a different object it's the vector 0 it's a set of in threedimensional space three zeros that's what we get when we cross a vector with itself of course this is going to trivially satisfy our condition on the a dot C is equal to 0 and B dot C is equal to 0 that's clear and so I think that's a nice set of four examples done quite quickly there they're not too bad are they so that's the end of the video ok in this video we're going to look again at the cross product but this time we're going to ask about its geometric meaning and its properties and we come to manipulated ok so if some vector C is the cross product of two other vectors a and B we've already seen how to work that out but what we can reasonably now ask is what it does that vector C look like you know if we imagine a particular couple of vectors a and B there in space where is this back to see how is it related to them we know how to work it out but what's its relationship with them how should we think about it and that's what we're gonna we're gonna figure out now so we know that C is a vector so it has two properties it has its magnitude and direction let's think about the magnitude first what is the magnitude of C and how does that relate to a and B what is the length of that vector it's pretty simple the magnitude of C is the magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B times sine of the angle between a and B this is very similar to the dot product except with a sine instead of a course so there we are there's our two vectors a and B and an angle between them and from those magnitudes the lengths of those two vectors and the angle we can work out the magnitude of C note that if we cross a vector with itself the angle will be 0 and so the cross product will be 0 just as we've already seen in our examples that was easy enough what about the direction of this new vector C how does that relate okay here's the thing the direction of C is perpendicular sorry for my writing there within writing C is perpendicular to both vectors a and B so it's at right angles to each of those vectors separately and simultaneously what does that look like well actually we can draw it in one of two ways one of which is right and one is wrong let's just do that so here's is I think to a here's I think to B if we draw C like that and make it clear with this little symbol that it's at right angles to those two vectors that would be perpendicular to them both how about this we could also draw it back to a draw back to be again and we could go in the opposite direction simply literally the opposite direction and that would also be perpendicular to these two vectors one of these is actually strictly the correct case and the other is wrong by essentially a minus a minus one multiple what's the way to work that out so let's let's now fear that out there's actually a rule to remember it by it's called the right hand screw rule so let's draw that out kind of really clearly one more time we have two vectors a and B and we are going to say that a cross B is equal to some vector C that's fine so what we do is we put on the line along which we know si must lie so this is the line that's perpendicular to both a and B and we simply have to ask ourselves in in this picture does the vector C go upwards or does it go downwards the trick is to write on the angle between a and B and give it a direction so that it's increasing from A to B it's the angle from A to B then you imagine taking your right hand and gripping that line in such a way that your fingers curl in the same direction as the angle increases and then your thumb points in the direction that the in the actual direction of C let's do another example just to really make that clear here's a and B again so we know we need to beat them I've drawn these lying in a plane so we are now trying to draw a line that's perpendicular to that plane vector C must lie in one direction or the other along this line what do we do we draw on the angle we now take our right hand and we imagine gripping that that line we've just drawn in such a way that our fingers curl in the direction in which the angle is increasing so it's like the anticlockwise direction in this picture and that's and then our thumb points in the correct direction for that vector so it's in fact these are the two opposite cases so that's the rule that allows you to construct the correct direction for your vector geometric geometrically okay then let's just finally wrap up by thinking about the cross product and asking whether it has those properties that we looked at before for our vector addition the commutative property so for example is a cross B equal to B cross a it is not it is not equal to it unlike the top product unlike addition this one Ross product it matters the order and in fact it simply introduces a minus sign if you swap the order of a and B so it's not commutative it nearly is in the sense that it gives you something similar it gives you the same thing up to a minus sign it's important to remember you can just verify that by thinking about how we work out and be with those diagonal products now how about the associative property can we say that a cross B cross C where B and C have already been worked out it's the same as a cross B and then cross C what do we think is that going to work or not in fact it this is the associative property we might ask whether this is true and the answer is no again the cross product does not have this property so the order in which you do your cross product if you have doing the cross product of three vectors does matter we can easily convince ourselves of this just by looking at a particularly convenient example let's just use Cartesian vectors ijk so let's just remind ourselves where these guys lie they're perpendicular to each other I J and K just our unit vectors going in the x y&z direction so suppose we have this guy I cross I cross K if we try evaluating it this way around with the I cross K being worked out first well that's just going to give us in fact minus J which you can confirm with the right hand rule that we just introduced and then that in turn will give us K that's fine so we've worked out in that instance the answer is minus K now let's do it the other way around I cross I if we do that first that's just going to be 0 because I cross I is 0 so it's game over already at that point so we can see two radically different answers here just depending on our order finally we could ask about the distributive property so are we allowed to multiply through using the cross product if we if the second object in our cross product is a sum of two vectors can we do this well this at last is something that we are going to be allowed to do it is the distributive property and the cross product operation the vector product does have this property we are allowed to do that but of course we must make sure to make to keep the order the same okay so I think that's everything for this video ok in this lecture we're going to be looking at something called the scalar triple product so what we're dealing with here is taking three vectors and combining them in a certain way in order to yield a single one scalar quantity so three vectors into one scalar scalar triple product suppose we have a we dot it with B which itself is crossed with C that is the scalar triple product of that combination now here I've put brackets to emphasize to do the cross product first but we can just write a dot B cross C without the brackets why because we have to do it in the correct order if we try to do a dot B first and then cross that with C it's a nonsense because that will be a scalar cross product it with a vector doesn't make sense all right then so let's do one we'll make up some vectors let's have a is equal to 3 1 minus 1 and B is equal to 2 0 4 and C is equal to minus 1 minus 2 3 ok there are our vectors and let's go ahead and work it out so first we'll need to do the cross product B cross C so let's write that out so I'm bringing these down now remember you can work out the cross product by whatever your favorite method is I'm just going to do it in the method I introduced before which is we ignore the first elements and we do befalling diagonal here zero and subtract the rising diagonal minus 8 that gives us the first element of 8 then we ignore the middle elements and we do the rising diagonal gives us minus 4 subtract the falling diagonal which is 6 so that's going to give us a minus 10 entry and then we ignore the third elements when we do the falling diagonal gives us a minus 4 and subtract 0 so that's going to be minus 4 that is our candidate for our cross product but it's always good to test how do we test a cross product we try dotting it with either of the input vectors and check we get 0 so here we'll get a 2 to 16 and 4 minus 4 is minus 16 add it up that is 0 and now we try the other combination here we're going to have minus 1 on 8 minus 8 and then plus 20 and then minus 12 that does indeed add up to 0 it's passed our checks those were just checks but it was good to do them and so we're now very happy that that is the correct cross product to finish the scalar triple product we now just need to dot that with a so let's write it out again I understand minus 4 and do the dot product that's 24 minus 10 plus 4 is going to be 18 that's the answer that's our scalar triple product it could have been a positive number a negative number could have been 0 in this case it's 18 now let's do another one so I'll erase this but we'll simply use the same the same three vectors but we'll do them in a different order as our second example so let's do B dotted with C cross a so of course we have to start by doing that C cross a combination first so let me write that down quickly 1 2 3 crossed with 3 1 1 so we start with the falling diagonal that's gonna be 2 and then we subtract 3 that's minus 1 and then we have a rising diagonal that's gonna be 9 and subtract 1 that's 8 and then we have a falling diagonal minus 1 and subtract minus 6 so that's going to be 5 in oh ok did I get that cross product correct or not do the dot product test minus 3 is minus 3 8 minus 5 that one's passed let's try this dot product combination as a second check double check 1 minus 16 plus 15 that's also going to come out at 0 so it's passed both of my checks that one is 0 as well we're happy that this is indeed the cross product at C cross a we now need to complete it so what we're doing is um B which was 204 dotted with what we found cross product minus one eight five so again go ahead and evaluate this minus two zero and 20 18 again alright so our second example has also given us 18 does this map mean that it doesn't matter in which order we do the elements of the scalar triple product let me just write down the answer to that and then we'll look at it it turns out that for any vectors a B and C then a dot B cross C is equal to B dot C cross a these were the two cases we looked at and it's also equal in fact to C dot a cross B this will always be true in this case it was equal to 18 but these three things would always be equal there are three other combinations we could write down in principle there are three other ways to combine a B and C we could have a dot C cross B or we can have B dot a cross C or we could have C dot B cross a now it turns out that those things are easy to see what their will be because let's just look at the difference from the ones above I've just swapped the order of the cross product and we know that when we Europe's we know that when we swap the order of a cross product we introduce a minus sign so if the top three cases were equal to 18 the bottom three cases must be equal to each other and equal to minus 18 and in general this is the same rule for all scalar triple product you know three of them are equal and three of them are equal to one another but equal to the minus of the first three so to speak and and how can you tell which ones are equal it's helpful to write out this little cycle a B and C written in a circle like this if we are going around in a clockwise direction here B dot C cross a but that's clockwise around our wheel then and here's another one that's got my C dot a cross B those guys all belong together so the guys that are in the clockwise direction all belong together and the anticlockwise guys they belong together and they're the minus of one another these two groups all right so that's that's I think all we need to do as practice for doing the scalar triple product and knowing what we ought to get let's think about something else I'm going to introduce you to something called the parallelepiped that's why I should say I'm not sure how to pronounce it parallelepiped anyway this guy is a threedimensional shape but first I'm going to remind you of what a parallelogram looks like so here's a rectangle and here's a parallelogram that we get if we have the pairs of the sides are parallel to each other but they are not a right angle at right angles around the vertex now consider this rectangular box and let's tidy up there we are and consider what happens if we build it out of edges that are in groups of parallel edges but are not all at right angles to each other so let's see if I can draw this reasonably realistically as a threedimensional object so I'm going to draw this and I'm going to stress which edges are parallel to each other all right here we are okay let me change color so consider these four edges of the object are all parallel to each other in exactly the same way that in our simple parallelogram these opposing edges were parallel and then these four edges are all parallel to one another again in our 3d shape just as these two edges are parallel and then we have another set these four edges here in yellow are also going to be parallel to one another that object is a particular threedimensional solid it's really a generalization of the of the box in that we're allowing ourselves to have slanting edges if we want to now let's introduce three vectors a B and C to represent these three kinds of edges you see that all the green edges are the same vector a and so on what happens if we do a dot B cross C that it turns out the magnitude of that if we drop the sign then the magnitude is just the volume of this shape so it contains of course the simple case of a rectangular box as a special case but this will work for any parallel parallelepiped that we care to think of although three vectors can always be combined with the scalar triple product to give us the volume and that's the end of the video welcome to the third arm topic in this video series where I'll be introducing the matrix and thinking about what is a matrix product alright so essentially a matrix is nothing more than a grid of numbers simply a grid of numbers that could be positive or negative or fractional or zeroes and when we specify the shape of our grid of numbers or we do so simply by stating how many rows we have and how many columns so we're gonna hear about rows and columns a lot in this video in this video course I'm going to use a particular way of writing a matrix as a symbol and I need to do that I'm going to just use a capital letter and I'm going to the letter is going to be double underlined I'll double underline that simple so here we go a underlined aligned that means the matrix a and how would we write it so that's just like this essentially a grid of numbers and we put it in curvy brackets just to give us some structure so this is three rows two columns that one here's a matrix B let's make it a square matrix let's put in a fraction to show we can 10 0 okay so there are two different examples of a matrix easy enough but it gets more interesting when we try and combine them so I want to talk about matrix multiplication addition is simple and it's just a element by element addition but multiplication is not so simple so here's how we write it the multiplication of matrix a by matrix B is simply written like this a b and it gives us some new matrix c which may be a different shape from both a and b as we'll see let's give ourselves a couple of examples 3 0 minus 1 2 3 4 a matrix B can be just 1 2 0 minus 3 so there are our two matrices here I've chosen them such that a B that multiplication will work it will exist but actually if we try it the other way around it will turn out that the multiplication the multiple of those two matrices doesn't even exist it's not a welldefined thing so this is an extreme case of an operation not being reversible in its order in other words matrix multiplication is not commutative okay so let's just erase that and go ahead and see how the multiplication actually works the trick is to multiply the each row of matrix in the first matrix by each entire column of matrix B what does that mean well let's write out our example 3 to 0 3 minus 4 minus 1 minus 1 4 1 0 2 minus 3 now I know that this guy is going to have 3 rows and 2 columns the output matrix you'll see why in a bit I'll just put these blanks in for now the question is how to work out each of these numbers let's choose this one first okay now notice this guy's address if you like is Row 1 column 1 of the output matrix C I'm going to need to in order to work this guy out I'll need to look at the whole of Row 1 in the first matrix in matrix a and the whole of column 1 in the matrix B I'll need to combine those guys and how do I get combine them I just multiply element by element as I go along the row and down the column so 3 times 1 just gives me 3 and then I add on the next combination 2 times 2 is 4 so 3 plus 4 is gonna give me 7 that's how I combine those two I'll jump back here and I'll they raised there and I'll just put in my 7 all right so that's the the general way it works let's go ahead and do the other elements of our matrix C let's do this one notice this is still Row 1 so I want that first row it's now column 2 that's its address all at the second column 3 times 0 and 2 times 3 is how I'll work that out and that's just going be minus six so let me jump backwards and arrays my blank symbol and write in 6 okay maybe I went a bit fast let me spell this one out more explicitly okay so here I now have Row 2 column 1 that's the address of that guy I want all of Row 2 and all of column 1 when I look at those guys and I want to multiply along so 0 times 1 and 3 times 2 that's gonna give us just 6 in total when we add them up so let me erase and put in 6 and now this element that's row 2 column 2 so I want all of Row 2 1 all of column 2 I multiply 0 times 0 and 3 times minus 3 is minus 9 so that's going to be a minus 9 if I go backwards and just put in minus 9 here now we're finally on to the final third row so we're going to want the third row of a and in this case the first column that's 1 times minus 1 and 4 times 2 is 8 that's gonna be 7 minus 1 plus 8 and it finally last row last column 4 times minus 3 is 12 and a 0 minus 12 all right so there we are that is our matrix product C formed by combining each row in each column it's quite a lot of work and it would be even more if we had bigger matrices but we said that we get something quite different if we try multiplying a and B in the other order so let's go ahead and do that now what if we have 1 0 2 minus 3 that's B 1 2 3 2 0 3 minus 4 so we can try it we try it and multiply Row one by column 1 and we immediately find that we cannot because they are a different length a different list so there is no third element of our row to multiply with our third element of the column just pause the video here and have a look at that and see why that must be impossible for us and so sometimes matrix multiplication is impossible all right let's look at a few little further examples and you may want to pause the video to convince yourself in each case is true is this thing possible for example pause it and think this one is not possible this is not possible again because there are two elements in say the first row of a and three elements in the column single column of B there's no way to do that as a series of element by element products how about this we just have this row matrix and this column matrix can we do that yes this one is perfectly possible actually it just produces a single number in fact it's a bit like it like a a dot product it's the whole of row one times which is the entire matrix and then the whole whole of column one in B this thing is called a row matrix and this other guy is called a column matrix for obvious reasons okay how about this let's have a look at this one what if I swap the order of my row and column I just swap them around can I do that is that going to produce a legitimate matrix actually yes it will this time swapping our two matrices a and B around has produced something which exists it's actually a huge matrix is 3 by 3 it must have three rows and three columns because a has three rows and B has three columns how is it work let's look at that guy for example it's just simply the number there which is Row one is just a number and column two is just a number a single number so we just do that product there's no problem pause the video if it's confusing all right so again the point here is that a times B is generally not equal to B times a even if they both exist they may not be the same they may not even be the same shape however we can go on and ask about the other kinds of properties of the matrix product operation a onto B times C is that the same as a times B onto C does the order matter actually it is the same it does work in other words we have the associative property how about a into B plus C sum of two matrices yes we can have a onto B plus a onto C that is therefore the distributive property matrix multiplication does satisfy those things it's just not commutative okay let me make a bit more room up here in the top of the screen and but one final puzzle up suppose I have this to Row three column matrix and then a mystery matrix M and then I have a simple column matrix of two rows and I'm asking what shape should matrix M be or is it even is it is it possible pause and think about that and in fact it's just a column matrix of three elements you may want to just meditate on that and see that it's correct okay that's the end of this video okay welcome to this video in this one we're going to take a look at how to work out our determinant what is it how can you find determinants of various sizes so a determinant is a scaler it's just a number could be positive could be negative could be zero and it's derived from a square matrix a single number derived from an entire matrix now the determinant of M would be written with M with the modular signs either side of it even though it can be a negative number so here's an example of M and here is how we would write the determinant of M note that we don't bother writing squares straight sides and curved brackets as well there's no point in that it's just enough to have the straightline sides so let's start with the definition of a 2 by 2 determinant that's the easy case to look at so let's write out a general 2 by 2 just using symbols will have a B C D written inside our straight line sides indicates a determinant it's simply ad minus BC okay so that's the falling diagonal the leading diagonal is also called minus the rising diagonal multiplied together very simple very simple and that is how you can just look at and evaluate a 2 by 2 determinant so for our example one two three four one times four is four subtract off a two times three is six and so that's going to give us minus two is the determinant ok so a 3 by 3 determinant is going to be a bit more work what we do is and we have a 3 by 3 determinant we evaluate it by breaking it up into a number up to three smaller determinants each of which is a 2x2 and for that we have our definition for immediate evaluation so we break up bigger determinants into little ones and then evaluate them I'm going to write out something here that's like a chessboard but instead of black and white I have pluses and minuses you'll see why in a moment the thing to notice though is that we alternate plus minus plus minus along each row and each column in this 3x3 grid ok so now let's work out a 3 by 3 determinant again I will just use general symbols a b c d e f g h i right now first I have to choose a row or a column I'm going to choose this top row for the first example and I'm gonna work along this row and I'm gonna start with the a symbol now I go and I look on my chart and I see that there's a plus sign in that in that slot of my grid that means I put down plus a and now what I do is I ignore the whole row and the whole column that a is in and I look at the remaining four numbers and I write a little determinant just made out of those guys in the same order they appear so EF is going to be in my main determinant there and H I those are the remaining four guys in the same order they appear now be the next term that has a minus sign according to my chart so I will put in minus B and multiply it by again are smaller twobytwo determinant the one I get if I delete the row and the column would be in it and look at the remaining guys D F G I and I just I just write those guys out in the same order they appear as a small twobytwo determinant finally there see see appears with a plus sign according to my chart so I need to put down plus C and I need to multiply by well we delete the row and column with C in it and we just see the remaining determinant D E G H so I simply imagine that that row and column was not there and then that's what the determine becomes and then of course those 2 by 2 determinants I can just write down what they are using my rule of multiplying down the diagonal and up subtracting the anti diagonal ok there we are so that is in general what a 3 by 3 determinant evaluates to but it's not the only way to do it let's write it out again and this time choose let's choose a column and a different one let's choose this column I'm also allowed to work down this so I would start with B as my first term and I delete the row and column with it in and I'd see what are the remaining terms and write them D F G I except I've forgotten something there's a minus sign attached to that particular entry so that should actually have been minus B all right and then similarly plus E and I delete the row and column which has unit and then I just make a 2 by 2 determinant from in this case would be the corner elements AC g I and I'd finally minus H and either own column with H in it make a 2 by 2 determinant determinant of what's left AC DF ok and of course I could then write out these 2 by 2 determinants explicitly but the point is it will get give me the same answer let's do an example and see why we would choose one method or the other so here just some random numbers I'm making up let's stick then n is 3 by 3 first off let's work along the top row and as what as we did in our first it that's going to be three let's put in the full determinant here and then minus one and again the determinant I get by excluding the top row and middle column and then plus two that's going to be 7 0 5 minus 1 and I can go ahead and I can work out explicitly what this comes out at as you can see I'm doing here and in fact it will be 12 plus 20 minus 14 and it comes out as 18 so there we are we've worked out a 3x3 but we could have done it in a different way let's say we went along this bottom row that's fine so then it will be 5 and I will be left with 1/2 0 4 for my mini terminal and the next element alone a minus sign and it was a minus number anyway minus minus 1 there's going to be 3 7 4 that's just to see how we've done that 3 2 7 4 by deleting the bottom row and middle column of that now what about the third element here well we actually have a 0 plus 0 times some determinant I don't even care what that is because it's been multiplied by 0 that's the beauty of it so I've got 5 into 4 minus 0 and then we're going to have 4 3 to 12 14 that's going to give us 20 minus 2 is 18 same answer as before ok what about if we have even bigger determinants than our 3x3 example that if we have if we go bigger still we for example a 4x4 we're just going to break it up into a number of three by threes and each of those would have to be broken up into two by twos lots of work so here we are here's a general 4x4 we are going to expand it along a row or column let's say we want to expand it along this row for example and we'll take in turn ABCD and we'll need to know what sign to use so here's our checkerboard or a chessboard pattern of pluses and minuses just extend it out now to a four by four and you can see the rule here is that if you like if the row number plus the column number is an Eve number then there's gonna be a plus sign and if it's odd it's gonna be a minus sign you can confirm that for yourself look at this one it's gonna be at row two and column three and that's five and so that's a minus that's one way to remember it or just draw it out anyway we're going to use that rule so we go ahead and we write plus a and now we need to do the entire 3 by 3 determinant that we get when we delete the row and column with a unit so we just write out that little square block that we see it's quite easy to copy across and now we're gonna have minus B and we need to delete the row and column and then transcribe across the elements that are left as a three by three just being careful not to make any slips and you see that we're gonna continue to so let's delete this just be completely explicit I'll finish the job off so I think I hope it's obvious what we're doing we aren't a + C and now we're going to just have EF h i j l and m n p and then finally minus d on to what we get if we delete the top row and rightmost column which is left over then EF g IJ k and oh there we are that's how we handle a four by four each of these three by threes would then have to be evaluated and so on so a lot of work and that's the end of the video okay welcome to this fifth topic which is eigenvalues and eigenvectors will introduce the problem and we'll see how to find eigenvalues finding eigenvectors is for the next video so suppose that we are given a square matrix just some matrix but we are told that M multiplied by V is equal to lambda multiplied by V for some scalar just some number lambda and for some column matrix V and a column matrix of course the same as a vector I will just say vector from now on okay so this scalar lambda could be positive negative or zero meanwhile this vector V could be anything except the trivial boring case of just zeros it's something other than that our challenge then is that we're going to be given a square matrix N and we have to look for any scalar lambda and vector V that satisfies the equation and such a scalar is called an eigenvalue and such a vector is called an eigenvector so in that language M multiplied by some eigenvector gives us back that eigenvector just multiplied by a scalar the eigenvalue okay so first off let's notice that if we are given a candidate our possible eigen vector V to try perhaps for a multiple choice then it's easy to test we'll just go ahead and try it so here's a square matrix a 2 by 2 2 4 1 minus 1 and suppose we write down V is equal to 1 minus 1 and this is suggested as a possible eigenvector well then we would just test it out to see if it matches our equation we try multiplying M by V so here we go 2 4 1 minus 1 and V is 1 minus 1 it's a column and so we do Rho times column that's 2 and minus 4 is minus 2 again row and column that's gonna be one plus one is two and we notice we can take out minus 2 as a factor and then it will be the vector at left is one minus one but it is just V so minus 2 is indeed a scalar that multiplies V and we've succeeded in proving that V is our eigenvector and our eigen value that goes with it is minus 2 okay so that's great if we're given I can vectors to check out but what if we're not given any eigen vectors or eigen values then we must find any possible eigen values for ourselves there could be more than one and for each we must find the corresponding eigen vector V and in this first video we're just going to be finding those eigen values ok so here's a little bit of quick manipulation and aside we know that our equation is MV is equal to lambda V I can certainly just bring it all to the left hand side and write MV minus lambda V is equal to 0 sometimes I don't want to write that as vector 0 but now let's do something interesting let's insert the identity matrix which won't change the equation but it will be important for the next step and the minus lambda times the identity times V is equal to vector 0 the identity doesn't change the equation but now I can factor out both those two matrices the M and the minus lambda times the identity that's a matrix I can factor those out and it allows me to write that in line now that if form of the equation it turns out this can only be solved for any interesting V any the other than just zeros if the following equation is true which we can easily prove but we're not going to prove in this video M minus lambda times the identity the determinant of that is equal to 0 so we're gonna have plenty of time to think about that but let me just put a green box around it because that is the fundamental equation we're going to use this will allow to find all the eigen values that satisfy our basic eigenvalue equation so let's do an example it's the best thing let's do em as a 2 4 this was one we had before 4 one little square matrix and so let's write down what this lands at times the identity is for a 2 by 2 it's going to be lambda 0 0 lambda very simple and so this matrix that's the difference of the two of them 2 minus lambda 4 1 minus 1 minus lambda just the difference of those two things as a determinant is equal to 0 that's all so there we have it we've just subtracted lambda off the down the diagonal but now we need solve this so we just write out the determinant 2 minus lambda x minus 1 minus lambda down the diagonal minus 4 the off diagonal is equal to 0 all right so we expand this out plus lambda squared minus four equals zero let's come over here for a bit more space tidy that up a bit what if we got lambda squared minus lambda minus six is equal to zero can we solve this actually it's quite easy to factor that's going to be lambda minus 3 into lambda plus 2 is equal to 0 so that's true if either lambda is equal to 3 or it's equal to minus 2 and those are our two eigenvalues we found them using that equation in the square box let's crack on and do one with a 3x3 matrix M here we go matrix M is equal to let's have 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 and minus 1 1 2 I've worked that while I checked that before and it will work for us nicely now let's remember of course the rule from the previous screen and we just need to apply that so let's go ahead and write it right our determinant out we need to have minus two minus lambda and then just 1 and minus 1 and then 1 minus 1 minus lambda and 3 0 to minus lambda I'm just subtracting lambdas down the diagonal making it a determinant setting equal to 0 now I'm gonna work along this row because it's got a zero in it so that makes me like it a bit more as a determinant the first number is gonna be minus 1 why because it's a 1 and let me just quickly write out our little lookup table of pluses and minuses for doing determinants so it was a 1 and then it picked up a minus sign and then we have the mini determinant that's made out of those four terms so that's 1 3 1 & 2 minus lambda all right and then the next term is gonna be plus and then it's gonna be the term itself is minus 1 minus lambda and the mini determinant that we get when we exclude that row and that column is just made out of the corner terms that's gonna be minus 2 minus lambda and 3 & 1 & 2 minus lambda and that's it because the zero term gives us nothing so there's only those two mini determinants let's write them out minus 1/2 times and then 3 times 1 is 3 expand that one out then this one has the term in front minus of 1 plus lambda and then we have to expand out the determinant minus 2 minus lambda times 2 minus lambda down the lead diagonal minus minus 3 is plus 3 there we are is equal to 0 and then we just need to tidy that up we need to clean it up a bit that's going to be minus of minus lambda minus 1 for the first term let's turn that it one into pluses multiply it through by the minus 1 and here we have minus let's make that lambda plus 1 write it that way around and then tidy up inside here we expand it out minus 4 plus 2 lambda minus 2 lambda plus lambda squared and this three is equal to zero need to keep on working to tidy that a bit more this term here is in fact going to be just I see the lambdas cancel out lambda squared minus one that's very nice that's come down very very neatly so now we can really tie to that up and we can take out a common factor of lambda plus one and the first term was just that so there's one for that and the second term we've just found is lambda squared minus one pause the video and check you agree that that's tied it up version of the equation now the way that can be 0 is either the first term is 0 which requires lambda is equal to minus one so there's one eigenvalue for us that's one option one of our eigen values has been found or the second term here has to be 0 so let's do a bit more work with that what we're saying is to neaten that up we're saying that two minus lambda squared is equal to 0 in other words lambda squared is equal to 2 and so lambda is going to be plus or minus square root of 2 that's two more eigen values three in all that we found for this three by three matrix and in the next video we'll see how to take each of these values and derive the corresponding vector this is the second of two videos that looks at eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the first video we have seen how to find eigenvalues and we write this as lambda for each lambda how do we find the eigenvector an eigenvector that goes with it we know that our fundamental equation that we're working with here is that when matrix M multiplies an eigen vector V it just gives us back that V scaled by lambda and another way to write that is the M minus lambda times the identity multiplied by V is equal to vector zero this is the same equation written two different ways what we need to know now that we have obtained our lambda values we just need to look at one of these equations and figure out an acceptable vector I find that it's more useful to use the form on the right hand side okay let's look at a particular example we'll have the matrix 2 4 1 minus 1 we looked at this before and we found already that its eigenvalues are equal to 3 and minus 2 what we're going to do now is we're going to take those values one at a time and figure out an acceptable eigenvector we're going to write our vector that we need to find as just X and y where we need to find these XY values now take a look at this green underlined equation and in particular the matrix which is a difference of two different matrices m and lambda times the identity now that we have our lambda value of 3 we could write out that difference that difference matrix it's going to be 2 minus 3 and then just 4 and then just 1 and minus 1 minus 3 there it is we're saying that when that multiplies our vector X Y it gives us 0 0 so let's go ahead and clean this equation up we have minus 1/4 1 minus 4 onto x and y it ought to be explicit about that we can multiply out it means minus X plus 4 y and X minus 4y and that we know is equal to 00 now what we immediately notice here is that whilst this this equation between two columns two column vectors is telling us two things it's actually telling us the same equation twice so we can see here that we're saying minus X plus 4y is equal to 0 we're also saying that X minus 4y is equal to 0 that's telling us the same thing is that a problem no that's exactly what we want to see at this stage we should find that when we work on eigenvalue and eigenvector problems based on a 2 by 2 matrix then really only one of these rows in the final expression constrains us and the other one doesn't add any new constraint so this is exactly what we want so now how do we go ahead and solve it we're saying that minus x plus 4y is equal to 0 of course we can just rearrange this to say instead that 4y is equal to X not the only constraint we have what we're allowed to do is choose we can choose the simplest values of x and y that will make this work so I'm going to choose Y is equal to 1 and then I'll find that X is equal to 4 and that is a perfectly acceptable eigenvector for one to go with my eigen value we will always have this freedom in choosing the elements of our eigenvector really this freedom simply corresponds to choosing how long the eigenvector is in other words its magnitude because if a particular eigen vector and eigen vector satisfies our equations a scaled version of that same eigenvector will still satisfy with the same eigenvalue now while the eigenvector can have any length we might specifically have been asked for a normalized eigen vector that simply means we need to take the one that we found and scale it to have unit length so in this case since it's for one we need to divide by root 17 to scale to unit length simple as that so there we are that's our eigen vector and a normalized version of it now we still haven't found the eigenvector for the other eigen value which is minus 2 let me just move this off on the screen to make space to do that at the bottom so here we go we do exactly the same procedure we subtract 2 on the diagonal 2 minus minus 2 and 4 and 1 minus 1 minus minus 2 lots of minus is there so let's tidy that up that's going to be 4 4 1 and in fact and then times X Y is equal to 00 as before we see that really these this is the same equation twice there's only one constraint and we can read it off simply as X is equal to minus y so if I choose X is equal to 1 for example then I'm going to write down an eigenvector 1 minus 1 but if I chosen Y is equal to 1 then it would have been minus 1 1 it doesn't matter they're both correct I can vectors to go with a power I can value but if we want to normalize well they need to divide by the magnitude 1 over root 2 ok so they're acceptable eigenvectors to go with the eigenvalue minus 2 ok so now let's find the eigenvectors that go with our eigenvalues for our 3 by 3 matrix M which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we looked at that before in the previous video and we found the eigen values which were minus 1 root 2 and minus root 2 and I've put little subscripts on our Landers here so we know which one we're dealing with that's still with lambda 1 first which is the one that has value minus 1 so I'll write over here the little equation that we're using over and over again which is that M minus lambda times the identified identity multiplied by our vector is 0 ok we need this difference matrix so we subtract off the diagonal 1 minus minus 1 and then 1 3 1 and minus 1 minus minus 1 and 0 minus 1 and to minus minus one and that's on X Y and said because we now need an eigenvector with three elements and it's going to be equal to where simplify the matrix 2 minus 1 1 3 1 0 0 minus 1 and that'll be a 3 that again is on X Y Zed eigen vector is equal to 0 0 0 now what we immediately notice is that as before we don't really have three different equations captured by our matrix equation we only have two in fact this is very obvious in this case because the bottom row is the same as the top row that's not always the case it's not always the case that the rows are actually identical we will always find if we check that there are only really two independent equations when we're dealing with 3x3 eigenvalue problems we only have two equations really now I'm going to highlight this row here 1 0 0 that's just saying in fact but X is equal to 0 now if we take either the top or the bottom runner we have minus X plus y plus 3 Z is equal to 0 or Y is equal to minus 3z ok so now we simply choose any values of y&z X has been dictated to us but any values of I y&z that satisfy these rules so if I choose that is equal to 1 that's going to give me Y is equal to minus 3 and I can straight away then write down as satisfactory eigen vector it will be 0 minus 3 1 as simple as that it doesn't matter where the minus sign is I could equivalently chosen said is equal to minus 1 and then I'd have 0 3 minus 1 if I normalize then I'll need 1 over root 10 being 3 squared plus 1 squared and so that is a complete solution for our first wagon vector we found it in simple form and in normalized form this is the eigenvector that goes with eigenvalue minus 1 we can go ahead however and check this eigenvector to make sure that it works so for that we'll simply need to write out our matrix and the original matrix which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we have our vector 0 3 minus 1 we just need to do this song so the first element is going to be minus 2 times 0 and then it's a 3 and I see there's a minus 3 so that does give us 0 and our second element is the only nonzero element will be minus 3 and our third third gives us 1 and we can write that as simply minus 1 on to 0 3 minus 1 and so indeed we found that this vector works with the eigenvalue of minus 1 now we can continue to look at to find the other eigen vectors but first let's take a pause and review the steps involved so we're looking at rules for solving eigen vector problems I can vector problem is where we have a square matrix M and we say that M multiplied by some special eigen vector gives us back that eigen vector times just by a value the eigen value we find the possible eigenvalues using this equation involving a determinant of a difference of two matrices in general there are going to be n solutions for an N by n matrix so two solutions for 2x2 three solutions three solutions for a 3x3 matrix that's because when we write the determinant it will have lambda to the power of n as its highest order so for example we have cubed to deal with when we're working out for 3x3 matrices now having found those eigenvalues we then for each value need to figure out an acceptable eigenvector what we've noticed is that generally we only have to use n minus 1 of the rows in the equation that we're working to satisfy and that meant just one row in the case of twobytwo problems and two of the rows in the 3x3 problems we had some freedom as to what values to choose for our eigenvector and in fact that freedom corresponds it to just scaling the entire eigenvector to a greater or smaller magnitude and if we were asked to normalize we would simply work it out using whatever values we like the simplest values and scale it at the last step so that it has unit length okay so we've covered a lot of ground for one video and this would be a good place to just stop watching if you like but I would like to carry on and solve the remaining two eigen vectors for our 3x3 example because they involve a square root 2 they're actually a bit more messy and tricky to do and in a way I think that makes for a good interesting example to see so let me go ahead and cut back to the screen that we had before with our matrix M spelt out and our possible eigenvalues and we'll now take the value lambda subscript 2 which is square root 2 so then as usual we need to subtract that down the diagonal so we'll have minus 2 minus square root 2 1 3 1 minus 1 minus square root 2 0 minus 1 1 2 minus square root 2 and that is the thing which when multiplied by our unknown eigenvector XYZ should give us 0 0 0 now one thing we notice here is the rows look all different it looks like we've got three different equations captured in this matrix equation but they are not if we examine them carefully enough we'd find that we can generate one of these rows from the other two and in fact we're only therefore going to need to use two of them you could pause the video and play with it and see if you can show this but it must always be the case unless we've made a slip earlier okay so I see that the middle row has a zero so I'm going to start with that one it says X plus minus 2 minus root 2 times y is equal to 0 and that means that if I choose a simple value for y of 1 then I can immediately say that X moving across is gonna be 1 plus root 2 good so now I'll use the top line which is minus 2 minus root 2 X plus y plus 3z is equal to 0 and I'll substitute in the values that I've already picked and inferred so I'm gonna get 1 plus root 2 on 2 minus 2 minus root 2 that's the X term plus the y is 1 plus 3z yet to be found is equal to 0 rearranged so put it on one side divided by 1/3 expand this thing out minus 2 minus root 2 2 root 2 minus 2 plus 1 all right oh and there's a minus sign because we've moved it all to the other side from the Z of course now we need to tie this up but what I notice is that inside the brackets I have a minus 3 and a minus 3 root 2 and that will cancel cancel with a factor of a minus in third of front and just give us a very simple expression of 1 plus root 2 so that's our Z term okay we've found a compatible set of x y&z values so we can now write down an accept acceptable eigenvector 1 plus root 2 1 1 plus root 2 there we are that is an acceptable eigenvector and here's where we found those numbers that goes with the eigenvalue lambda 2 is equal to the square root 2 note that i used the same subscript 2 on my vector so that i make it clear that lambda subscript 2 goes along with vector subscript 2 so now our only remaining task is to look at the third eigenvalue which was negative root 2 and find a compatible eigenvector for that one so as always what we need to do is take the vector M and subtract that the lambda value we found off down the diagonal and because we're subtracting minus a minus number we can just add it instead of course so that will be minus 2 plus root 2 and then 1 and then 3 and then 1 and minus 1 plus root 2 and 0 and minus 1 and 1 and 2 plus root 2 and that matrix when multiplied by unknown eigen vector XY said will give us 0 0 0 now as before our middle row looks nicest here it's just telling us that X plus 21 put it that way around Y times y is equal to zero that means if I chose Y is equal to one obvious choice then X is equal to one minus root 2 watching for signs now if I take that say the bottom row I can have minus X plus y plus 2 plus 2 root plus 2 plus root 2 times Z is equal to 0 but I can substitute in the values I found so that will say that square root 2 minus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to 0 ok I've got some work to do to find out the value of Z here I'll start by rearranging just to put 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to minus root 2 on the other side but I still need to do a bit more work divide both sides I notice I can simplify simplified by a factor of root 2 I can write this as that is minus 1 over root 2 plus 1 pause the video check you agree with me and then I'm not happy with that because I don't want to leave Z as a fraction I could do but that would make a very messy looking I can vector I noticed there's a trick in up I have up my sleeve I know that if I multiply the top and bottom of a fraction like that by root 2 minus 1 it will simplify I will then find that the top of course is 1 minus root 2 but the bottom will be 2 plus root 2 minus root 2 minus 1 and that whole expression just comes down to 1 finally then Z is equal to 1 minus root 2 we've now found our XY and z values that are acceptable so we're seeing saying that vector 3 that goes with the lambda 3 value is 1 minus root 2 1 1 that is an acceptable mic inventor so we're done for our 3x3 matrix M we found that three eigenvalues and for each of them an eigenvector the last two of these which involve the root two were more tricky just because there was more particular COFF more messy expressions but the basic maths is the same every time
