hi and welcome to opmt 1110 introduction to business math today we're going to start at the very beginning what is the point of business the point of business is profit of course there's other reasons to be in business lots of other reasons but in the context of a business math class this is what we care about mathematically profit is defined as sales minus costs sometimes instead of sales we say revenue and instead of costs we say expenses in the context of this class those are going to be interchangeable terms revenue and sales we also sometimes talk about this as money in money out and that's going to come up a lot throughout this course what do we know about profit when profit is a positive number that means bigger than zero that is a good thing on the other hand when profit is less than zero that's a negative number i'm going to write that that is less than that is going to be bad finally when profit is exactly zero that is what we're going to call the breakeven point and we'll get back to that in a couple of weeks but the word for a profit of exactly zero when sales equals cost is break even to understand the different types of expenses and the different types of profits we're going to go over an example example number one to run a lemonade stand charlie and sam spent 20 dollars in building a booth and 100 on lemons and sugar they brought in 300 in sales find their cost net profit and gross profit here we have two types of costs we've got fixed costs this is also called operating expenses and some books call this op for operating or fc for fixed costs we also have variable costs and those are also called costs of goods sold sometimes cogs and sometimes vc for variable costs in this case we have both types of expenses our operating expenses here are the 20 on the booth we spend that once no matter how much lemonade we make so that's a onetime expense that's what makes it an operating expense as opposed to our lemons and sugar which is a hundred dollars so every time we make a batch of that much lemonade we're going to have to spend an equal amount of money on lemon and sugars so what's our total costs 120 or 100 plus 20. that is our two types of expenses so now what we can do is look at what we call an income statement we write down our sales then we subtract the cost of goods solds and at the end what we get is called a gross profit so in this case we have three hundred dollars in sales minus one hundred dollars which gives us a gross profit of two hundred dollars that's the gross profit and it is sales minus cost of goods sold now we're going to subtract those operating costs so we spent twenty dollars on that booth and at the end what we're going to get is 180 and that is our net profit net profit is going to be all of our sales minus all of our expenses and eighty dollars is how much money we end up with in this this scan this up is the bottom line net profit so in the end we have a hundred and eighty dollars in profit let's sum up just the different equations that we went over we've got sales is money in is revenue we have costs that's money out is expenses we have profit that is sales minus cost we have net profit sorry we have two types of costs we have cost of goods sold and we have operating costs op or fixed cost and that is the cost of things that we are spending one time finally we've got gross profit is going to be sales minus cost of goods sold and then we have net profit which is going to be gross profit minus operating expenses hi now we're going to talk about ratios fractions and percent proportions and percent let's write that all down these are different ways of looking at the same problem a fraction is given as an amount over a base mathematically you might have heard this as the numerator over the denominator it's a hard word to spell a over c i'm going to give the example of 3 over 25 that's a fraction a ratio in a ratio we're going to express that in two parts 3 to 22 or a to b this is a way of comparing the two parts i've broken my fraction that has 25 pieces into two bits three and 22. when i add those together i get 25 so a ratio is a way of breaking our fraction up let's look at the same thing in decimal in decimal 3 over 25 is equal to 0.12 that's the same as 12 which means we have many ways of saying the same thing 3 twentyfifths three to twentytwo zero point one two twelve percent those are all the same but we use them in different ways often the one we like best is percent we use percent a lot in business because it's easy to understand 12 just makes a lot of sense however ratios do come in handy when we have lots of things to compare so i might say a to b to c equals one to three to two that means i've broken my hole into six parts one two three four five six i am going to color one of them a i'm going to color three of them b and i'm going to color let's uh sorry make this green the rest of it c two parts are c one part is a three parts are b question two detailed information about the minute made lemonade company is supplied below they have sales of 20 million dollars cost of goods sold that's things like lemons and sugar and cans or 12 million dollars giving them a gross profit of 20 minus 12 equals 8 million dollars their operating expenses that's things like salaries and factory costs are 5 million dollars leaving them with a net product profit of 3 million dollars this is an income statement and this is how we often write our expenses sales minus cost of good is gross profit minus operating expenses equals net profit the net profit is the bottom line what we're going to do is create a common size income statement that means that each line is as a percent of sales so we take each line and we divide it by sales so our sales line is going to be 20 million dollars i'm gonna write million that's okay because i can cancel it out 20 million over 20 million equals 100 percent so i write one hundred percent our sales line is always a hundred percent next we do our cost of goods sold and that's going to be 12 million dollars divided by 20 million dollars cancel out those millions and we end up with 60 percent we have two choices for the gross profit we can observe that gross profit is 100 minus 60 equals 40 percent but we can also observe that 8 million dollars divided by 20 million dollars equals 40 percent so either way works next we're going to do our operating expenses operating expenses is 5 million divided by 20 million dollars is 25 subtract again and we end up with 15 percent the important things are these two numbers gross profit divided by sales is called something special it is the percent gross margin that's going to be the gross profit divided by sales the one at the bottom here this is called the percent net margin and that's going to be the net profit divided by sales sometimes we call this pgm and sometimes we call this pnm and these are both examples of profit margins important thing when you hear margin we always divide by the sales question three finally we're going to use the concept of percent net margin or profit margin to be able to compare our two lemonade stands so let's remember back to the last video when we had sam and charlie sam and charlie had sales of 300 and they had a net profit of 180 that gives them a percent net margin of i'm gonna write the formula again net profit divided by sales is 180 divided by 300. this gives us 60 percent minute maid has a p n m as we already calculated before of 15 so we've got 15 percent and we've got 60 percent which one is better i'm going to go with sam and charlie so sam and charlie have a much smaller business but they have higher profit margins because they're keeping more of their money for every dollar in sales sam and charlie keep 60 cents for every dollar in sales minute maid keeps only 15 cents keep less of their money 85 cents goes to expenses now which one is the better business that's harder to compare sam and charlie with their small stand probably can't compete with minute maid on an international basis but just based on margins they're keeping more of their money hi now we're going to do a more complicated example sarah likes to keep the investments in her rrsp that's a registered retirement savings program in a ratio of 1 to 3 to 2 in cash bonds and stocks last year she invested twelve thousand dollars in total how did she invest her initial twelve thousand dollars first this is a ratio problem we have cash let's switch colors to bonds to stocks is equal to the ratio of one to three to two that means that our total is twelve thousand dollars which is going to be in how many parts it's going to be six parts one plus three plus two we add those together to get the total number of parts so each part is going to be two thousand dollars because two thousand dollars times six equals twelve thousand dollars so we start with twelve thousand dollars i'm going to do our initial percentage as a fraction instead of as a percent cash is going to be one over six bonds are going to be three over six and stocks are going to be two over six when we add those up together they add up to six over six or a hundred percent i've already said that one part is two thousand dollars so i'm going to fill that in here three parts then is going to be three times two thousand dollars which is six thousand dollars and finally two parts is going to be two times two thousand dollars is four thousand dollars when i add those up together and try them they do add up to twelve thousand dollars over the year her cash investments rose by three percent her bonds by eight percent and her stocks lowered by two percent that means she lost money what was her profit or loss over the year for part b we're going to look at percent change so start with three percent so percent change is always done by the old value times one plus the change i'm going to call that r equals the new value so for cash we end up with two thousand dollars one plus 0.03 equals 2000 times 1.03 which is 2060. that's today's value another way to do that would be to find the interest that would just be that two thousand dollars times 0.03 which is 60 dollars so we would put sixty dollars in here for bonds let's do the interest instead of the total we'll end up with six thousand dollars times 0.08 that's eight percent and that gives us four hundred and eighty dollars so i put that in there which means that i have a total of six thousand four hundred and eighty dollars finally stocks is a loss that's okay we can just still multiply four thousand dollars times negative 0.02 which gives us a negative number that negative number is 80. so she lost 80 dollars to show how the stocks would look like when we do the total or the new value we would say 4 thousand dollars times one minus 0.02 which is going to be 3920 or four thousand dollars minus eighty dollars giving us a total of four hundred and sixty dollars worth of interest 60 plus 480 minus 80 giving us now a total of 12 460 or 12 000 plus 460. now we get to part c the final and more difficult part the problem with this is that now we have more money but her money is no longer evenly balanced because sarah lost money in stocks she doesn't have a ratio of 132 anymore when she invests her 25 40 she's going to add that to the 12 460 dollars she already has giving her a total of fifteen thousand dollars so her new total is fifteen thousand dollars that's how much money she has in total with last year's twelve thousand four hundred and plus her this year's 2 540. so what we're going to do now is do the same thing we did before and break that into parts so this is six parts is 15 000. that means that one part is going to be equal to twenty five hundred dollars and i'm going to do that math so one part over six parts is equal to something over fifteen thousand dollars when we cross multiply we get x equals fifteen thousand dollars divided by six and then we get that it is twenty five hundred dollars that means that sarah wants to have 2500 in cash meaning she needs to invest an additional 440 which is 2500 minus 20 60. she's going to invest an extra 440 in cash for bonds we have three parts is going to be 2500 times 3 or if you prefer this it's going to be 15 000 times that ratio of 3 6. it doesn't matter which way we do it we still get seventy five hundred dollars and stocks we're going to take that 2500 times two and end up with five thousand dollars we check when we add those together 2500 plus 7500 plus 5 000 it actually does equal 15 dollars let's finish our differences subtraction tells us we need to invest one thousand and twenty dollars in bonds and more money one thousand and eighty dollars in stocks i'm actually going to check and add those together and not surprisingly it still adds up to 2540. so once sarah invests her money this way she will end up with an evenly balanced portfolio let's talk about markups and markdowns goods travel through many outlets before they reach the consumer i'm going to draw a graph of one item let's say this is a watch we've got the manufacturer have the wholesaler we have a retailer and we have me i'm the consumer what happens with this watch as we go through the watch costs the manufacturer 100 in materials and in operating costs let's just go with materials cost of goods sold then the wholesaler is going to pay more for that they're going to pay 145 that means that the manufacturer used a markup of 45. they bought it at a hundred dollars and they marked it up or have a profit of forty five dollars and here we're going to continue to just talk about gross profits so forty five dollars happened there the retailer well the retailer is not going to pay 145 the retailer paid 175 dollars meaning we have a markup of 30 dollars finally i pay more than 175 i'm actually going to pay 200 for this watch meaning the retailer marks it up by 25 so markup in dollars and i'm going to explain why i keep on saying in dollars in a moment is actually equal to the gross profit per item so for one watch the manufacturer makes 45 that's their profit the retailer their profit is 25 here the total markup from start to finish on this watch on this item is one hundred dollars that one hundred dollars is divided up forty five dollars goes to the manufacturer next thirty dollars goes to the wholesaler something like costco where the retailer shops or a person who buys from factories and sells just to store the retailer makes 25 and that's the store at the mall where i bought my watch i make no money because i'm now wearing the watch so that's our total markup when i add those together it adds to 100 total and the profits are divided like we talked about before with margins it makes sense to talk about percent percent markup is equal to markup over cost and we sometimes call that the gross profit per item over the cost or cost of the goods sold so that's the markup here our percent markup and sometimes we just call that markup is 100 in profit over one hundred dollars in cost is one hundred percent or one but let's look at each individual one so we have the manufacturer remember the manufacturer made 45 over 100 that was the cost is going to be a 45 markup when we go to the wholesaler let's just change colors there because why not the wholesaler made thirty dollars right 30 dollars but they also paid more they paid 145 because their cost was more that's going to be 20.69 markup and finally let's go to the retailer well their profit that was 25 but they paid more they actually ended up paying 175 dollars which gives us a markup of 14.29 percent the denominator here changes because it was the cost at each step what happens when i add these things together i end up with a round that means around 80 percent i'm going to cross that out don't add these when you add them together with you end up with nonsense something that doesn't make a lot of sense and that's because those bases were different the denominators of those fractions were different and that's what's giving us a problem the total markup as we know is a hundred percent even if those numbers don't add that way and that was because a hundred dollars profit over a hundred dollars cost equals one hundred percent okay let's talk about margins and markups percent margin versus percent markup margin is based on sales markup is cost as a base those are different margin is equal to gross profit over sales and this is the percent gross margin which is the one we're normally worrying about right now and here percent markup is the same amount or numerator but a different base try to figure out a way to remember this i tend to use markup has a co sound cost has a co sound margin no ku sound sales no cosound that's my mnemonic for remembering why margin goes with sales and markup goes with costs that may or may not be helpful to you let's go through one example of this a different example so let's pretend an item costs one hundred dollars to buy in a store the store paid forty dollars the gross profit is going to be sixty dollars so i bought uh groceries for a hundred dollars it cost the store and then we have stores profit using this basic we can do both the percent margin and the percent markup percent margin is profit over sales here that's going to be sixty dollars over one hundred dollars and that equals to sixty percent percent markup on the other hand well that's equal to profit over cost which is still 60 the cost is only forty dollars which gives us 150 percent that's okay i'm gonna note that markup can be very big however margin is always going to be less than a hundred percent let's do an example this is question one arizona computers marks up merchandise by 25 part a if a laptop costs 500 how much would it sell for now write down some formulas to start let's remember that percent markup equals profit over cost i like to start all these questions by writing down an abbreviated income statement sales minus costs equals profit here we're talking about gross profit but in essence it doesn't matter overly we're just going to say sales minus cost equals profit now i'm going to fill in the things i know from the problem i know that markup is 25 or 0.25 i know that sales is what i'm looking for the sales price i know that cost to the store is 500 and i know that profit is well i don't know that yet so i'm going to have to find that out let's look at this expression i've got profit equals cost times 0.25 this is formula in fact i can write here that profit equals cost times the percent markup remember that one i can also write this sales equals costs plus one percent story sales equals cost times one plus the percent markup here i'm gonna fill in what i know the cost is five 500 and the markup is 0.25 that means that the sales is going to be 625 dollars i can write that in here if we needed to how much would the profit be the profit would be 625 minus 500 equals 125 dollars also note if i use this equation 500 times 0.25 i'm going to come up with exactly 125 that's the profit let's continue on with part b now we're talking about a different object a desktop that sells for 750 and we're going to find the cost i'm going to remember that percent markup equals 0.25 and i'm going to write that same expression down sales minus cost equals profit this time i know just the sales price and i'm trying to find the cost so what we are going to do now is solve this problem using the expression earlier i said that sales equals cost times 1 plus the percent markup if i divide both sides by one plus the markup i'm just gonna say percent m for now this will cancel out as long as it's not equal to zero and i end up with this expression cost equals sales over one plus the percent markup that's another good formula that we can use anytime we need all i have to do is plug in the numbers that i know sales is 750 and markup is 0.25 so i get 750 over 1.25 which equals 600 dollars i put that in here so now we know the cost and if i need to know 150 dollars was the profit let's do a check profit over cost equals 150 over 600 dollars which is exactly 25 percent that's always a good thing to do check to make sure that our work is correct now let's go on to part c the company had total sales of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the month calculate the cost of goods sold and gross profit and percent margin so now we have a lot more information about this company i'm going to scroll this up but i'm still going to remember percent markup for this entire problem was 25 that's important to know and as usual let's just start with the same co income statement sales minus cost equals profit instead of one item now i'm talking about many items but it doesn't matter because the math is exactly the same i know i have sales of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so what is my cost of good sold one there it is i'm correcting that okay so cogs is the same as cost and we're just going to say that's sales over 1 plus the percent markup in other words we have 150 000 over 1.25 which is 120 000 so 120 000 and that gives us a gross profit of 30 dollars we also needed the percent margin and that's going to be percent gross margin because we don't have any information about operating expenses so the margin is always going to be equal to profit over sales so here we have thirty thousand dollars over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars same numerator as the markup but a different denominator or base this gives us twenty percent so that is our percent margin let's go back to that finding a percent margin i'm going to go based on my laptop remember the laptop that we worked on in part a so our laptop had sales minus cost equals profit and in that case it was 625 our cost was 500 leaving us with a profit of 125. here the percent margin would be 125 over 625 which equals 20 let's do it one more time change colors because i enjoy that desktop we've got sales cost profit here the sales price of a desktop was 750 dollars and the cost was 600 giving us a profit of 150 so our percent margin is 150 over 750 which equals 20 percent no matter how we do this these are all the same 20 20 20 that's because the markup and margin are always travel together scroll down here and just say a markup of 25 is always equal to a margin of 20 those things travel together continuing with question one we're going to start talking about markdowns or discounts remember arizona computers marks up its merchandise by 25 percent that means the percent markup which equals profit over cost equals 0.25 now we're going to talk about a discount the company is having a sale where all goods are marked down by 10 of their selling price if a tablet is on sale for 200 how much did it cost so let's talk about this problem again we've got a markup of 25 which means that we have a margin of 20 which is what we found out in part c i'm going to use the following formula and that is going to be new price equals old price times 1 minus the discount we usually call that d when i divide both sides by 1 minus the discount or move it around i end up with old price equals new price over one minus the discount okay this is a twostep problem so step one is find the old price once we have that we can start working on the cost so we know that new price equals hundred dollars and we know that the discount is ten percent 0.10 or 10 percent that means that the old price equals new price instead of writing new i'm just going to put in 200 over 1 minus 0.1 which is the same as 200 over 0.9 here when i run that through i'm going to come up with 222 dollars and 22 cents i'm gonna round this originally there was a bunch of twos rounding that could be a video all on its own i can't sell something for a fraction of a cent that's against the law a cent or one hundredth of a dollar is the smallest proportion i can use i'm going to round that so now i've got part two going to find the cost so i've got sales minus cost equals profit the original price was 222 dollars and 22 cents and i know that the markup was 25 which means that cost equals sales over the markup one plus the markup run that through my calculator and i'm going to end up with 177.78 that was the original cost i'm going to write a sentence to finish that one off okay let's talk a little bit more of markups and markdowns i'm going to go through an example scroll this up i'm gonna buy a pair of apple brand air pods for 200. so i get those into my store now my store is going to have a 15 markup today only there is a 15 off sale sale is the same as a discount or markdown what's our profit on a pair of air pods well let's run through using our formulas the original price is actually two hundred dollars times one plus the markup i'm going to write down the formula underneath and that gives me a normal sales price of 230 dollars but now i've got a discount so new price equals old price times 1 minus the discount let's write down that formula and then let's put in our old price is 230 and our discount is 15 when i run that one through my calculator i'm just going to note that 1 minus 15 is 0.85 i end up with 195 dollars and 50 cents so what was my profit well it's not a profit it's a loss i lost 400 400 4.50 for every set of airpods i sold that's not good for my business as soon as i'm having a loss or a negative profit we're in trouble i'm going to write the moral of the story and that is 15 markup plus 15 mark down is not zero why isn't it and that has to do with the same reason when we were adding before when we talked about markups our base is different the base being 230 is different than the base being 200. let's do one more question to learn more about markups and margins artco fine handbags prices its products to give a 40 margin what rate of markup do they use let's remind ourselves first of what our formulas are percent margin no cosound is profit over sales percent markup with that sound hard k is profit over cost those are the two formulas we're going to use i'm going to put in something that we're going to use throughout this course and also in math when there are no numbers and there's no cost sales or profit just make something up we can do that because as we saw in our last example proportionately the markup and margin are always the same so it doesn't matter what we do when we know the margin i like to set sales to be a hundred dollars because 100 is easy to use so let's pretend we have sales of a hundred dollars so we've got sales of 100 minus some sort of cost over profit well what's our profit profit is 40 percent of sales or 0.40 times sales and that comes from this formula percent margin equals profit over sales multiply both sides by sales and we come up with profit equals percent margin times sales so our profit here is going to be 0.4 times 100 which is 40 dollars okay fill that one in i made a hundred dollars in sales my profit was 40 all i need to do is subtract to come up with a cost of 60 so my percent markup is going to be 40 over 60 or twothirds and i'm going to round that to 66.66666 or sixty six point six seven percent when in doubt two decimal places after the percent sign here we could have set sales to be anything we wanted had i set sales to be one dollar i would have 60 cents worth of cost and 40 cents worth of sales i also could have sorry worth of profit i also could have set sales to be 237 but that makes the arithmetic harder one a hundred ten a thousand those are easier numbers to work with i'm going to do parts b and c together because they really travel together our company had profits of six hundred thousand so what was their cost of goods sold well let's go back to our percent markup percent markup is profit over cost so 0.6667 is equal to the profit 600 000 over cost or we end up with cost equals six hundred thousand dollars divided by zero point six six six seven i wanna make a note if this algebra is tough for you that's a good reason to go back into the homeworks and look at the introductory lesson 0 homeworks there's lots of good algebra there i'm going to go back to this question all we have to do is say that this is actually nine hundred thousand dollars let's go into part c right away i wanted to do these together because what i really want to do is an income statement sales minus cost of goods sold equals gross profit minus operating expenses equals net profit this is always a good way to start okay they had profits of thousand dollars and here i'm going to note it doesn't say so but this must be gross profit or it doesn't make sense so under gross profit i'm going to write 600 thousand dollars i'm gonna write in my costs of nine hundred thousand dollars and then i'm gonna go upwards and note that sales must be nine hundred thousand dollars i'm gonna use k for thousand plus six hundred thousand dollars and that ends up with one point five million let's write that in okay operating cost net profit right now right next to this i'm going to draw a common line income statement 100 percent i know the gross profit is 40 because that's the margin we've already done that one and we know here then that the cost of goods sold is sixty percent what do i know the operating expenses are five percent of sales five percent that means that op is going to be take that sales and multiply it by five percent that gives us 75 000 i put that into here now i have two options i can do just subtraction that gives me a net profit of hundred and twenty five thousand dollars but i can also subtract these together forty percent minus five percent equals thirty five percent percent net margin it's difficult to know whether people are talking about gross margins and net margins when in doubt always try to clarify in case we want to check our work we can note that 35 of 1.5 million is equal to 525 000 so we get the same answer either way finally let's do part d the most recent shipment of bags had a cost of 270 000 what is the selling price well this is back to the basics and we have sales equals cost times 1 plus the percent markup when i put this together i end up with 270 000 and i know my markup it's one plus 0.6 in general it's better not to round but rounding in this case won't come up with a really big problem because we end up with sales of 450 000. hi today we're going to talk about trade and cash discounts a trade discount is a different way of looking at markups instead of looking at it as marking up we're going to look at it backwards so let's look again at some sort of item going through the chain the supply chain let's start with the manufacturer this time we're going to go straight to the retailer and skip the wholesaler step and then the consumer so we have a good it travels from the manufacturer to the retailer to the consumer at each step someone is paying money let's look at the retailer the retailer purchases it for 200 from the manufacturer and they're going to go ahead and sell that item to me for 250 so the retailer makes 250 every time they sell an item each item costs them 200 and then we have that gross profit per item or markup in dollars which is fifty dollars and that is let's call that markup in dollars or gross profit when we look at this as a percent we can see that markup is going to be gross profit or markup in dollars over cost which is 50 over 200 and that is 25 so the markup is 50 or 25 that's one model of looking at how the retailer buys it when the retailer sets the price we have another model i'm going to call this the apple model because it's the way that apple sells their products in this model the manufacturer sets the price not the retailer let's write that down they set the price not the retailer the store then bought an item let's say those airpod earbuds or some sort of apple produm they bought a 250 item with a discount and i'm going to call this a trade discount because that's a discount for being a retailer of 50 so they had a 50 discount and that's going to be at what percent or that would be 50 over 250 that's a 20 discount so they bought that 250 dollar item at a discount let's look at the supply chain from the way the retailer buys at we're going to say the retailer they buy from their manufacturer and then they sell it the consumer and on the way they mark it up by 25 from 200 to 250 or they mark it down by 20 and that is going the opposite direction so moral of this story is a 25 markup is the same as a 20 discount that's how that trade discount works now let's talk about chained discounts that's going to be when we have more than one discount and we're going to see in our examples this happens all the time so let's say you go to a store and they have a sale 25 off plus today only an additional five percent that's a good sale what we do is we apply one discount than the other one so let's look at pretending that we have something that's worth a hundred dollars so if we have our original price is 100 then our new price is going to be 100 times 1 minus 0.25 or 75 then we apply the next one today only so today's price is going to be 75 minus 5 that is 71 and 25 cents that's the price we're paying today but wait a second twenty five percent plus five percent equals thirty percent seventy five a hundred dollars times one minus thirty percent is seventy dollars so this is not the same and we've seen this before the moral of the story is never add because we're really using proportions with different bases this doesn't make sense what we're really going to end up doing is multiplying them together we could do this all in one stage question one a company makes snowboards that retail at thousand two hundred and fifty dollars the company offers chain discounts of thirty percent five percent with retailers calculate the price a retailer would pay for the snowboards why are there multiple discounts sometimes that's everybody gets 30 and 5 is for clients who pay on time or clients who have a long relationship there's many reasons to have a chained discount the price that we the consumer would pay is called the list price here it's one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars our cost is going to be our list times one minus the discount one one minus discount two and all we have to do is put our numbers in there our list price is one thousand two hundred and fifty one minus zero point three oh and one minus zero point oh five let's simplify that before i put that in a calculator just because it's easier to put in a calculator when we simplify it a little bit running that through we end up with 831 cents that's what a retailer is going to pay even though the consumers are going to pay a lot more for their snowboard a good question to ask is what single discount or single equivalent discount is equivalent to these two discounts that's a lot of words what that means is instead of saying thirty percent and five percent we could just say one number like 38 or 40 percent one thing to remember from before we know it isn't 30 plus five percent equals thirty five percent that's definitely not going to be the answer let's put an x right through that but we're gonna still use two different methods so method one we're going to take the old price and the new price as a proportion so we take the new price or the cost over the old price or the list and look at them as a proportion so i've got 831.25 divided by the list price of 12.50 and when i put those together i have 0.665 that means that we paid 66 and a half percent of lists or we had a discount of 1 minus 0.665 equals 34.5 33 sorry 0.5 percent let's just scroll down a little bit more now let's try another method either of these works there's more methods even than i'm saying that's one of the things with the algebra but whatever method you're using you want it to work i'm going to take the price and i'm going to put it on both sides of my equation then i'm going to use a different color and you'll see why price times 1 minus 1 minus our discount i'm going to call our single discount x because x often stands for unknown it's the same as price 1 minus 0.301 minus minus 0.05 let's just erase that because we have price on both sides and our price is nonzero we can just cancel those numbers out so now i have one minus x equals zero point seven zero 0.05 sorry nine five i multiply this through and i get one minus x equals 0.665 that's familiar which means x equals 0.335 or 33.5 notice that both methods are giving us the same answer this one is more algebra and this one uses the numbers you already know now let's look at what the percent markup is to the retailers well this is something that we know how to do percent markup equals profit over cost i know that the sales price or list price is 12.50 the cost is going to be 835 831.25 which means that my gross profit per item must be 418 dollars and 75 cents when i put this together let's change colors because why not i end up with 418 75 over 831.25 which gives me 50.38 percent markup a nice healthy markup now part d due to a slowdown in sales the manufacturer would like to increase the total discount given to its retailers to 40 percent what additional discount must they offer this is asking us to find one more discount d so that i can come up with this equation i'm going to say 1250 1 minus 0.30 1 minus 0.05 1 minus d and i don't know what d is is equal to right in that 1250 again 1 minus 0.5 once we have it written out this way there's lots of ways we can solve it i like to observe that that 1250 is the same on both sides so i don't actually need to know what that is i also know what one minus 0.3 and 1 minus 0.05 is that is the same as 1 minus 0.335 because we've done that 1 minus d equals 1 minus 0.4 is 0.60 so now i can divide both sides by 1 minus 0.335 and that's just 0.665 we know that and we end up with d equals 1 minus 0.9023 or the discount is 9.77 percent three discounts thirty percent five percent nine point seven seven percent when i add them together and chain them properly that is the same as forty percent just one note on these videos i'm not as amazing as a at arithmetic as it looks like i pause these videos to use my calculator and i encourage you to do the same get out your calculator and use it to compute as you go along okay now we're going to talk about cash discounts and payment terms these are things that are going to incentivize us to pay erla early or to pay in cash instead of credit you might have seen this before you go to a restaurant and there's a cash discount of five percent if you pay in cash and don't use a credit card so let's put not credit this is good because it incentivizes our customers to do the things we want when we write down payment terms that include our discounts it looks kind of like this 310 i'm going to write some more things here and 45 and there's some other stuff here this means there is a three percent discount if you pay within 10 days otherwise the net that's where the n comes from the net or everything all the money is due in 45 days 3 10 and 45 3 discount 10 days net everything due in 45 days then we put some extra terms here if we need it there's other abbreviations that you can always look up so this bill is due in 45 days i'm just going to put a little asterisks here any discount is for goods only not on your tax or your delivery etc that goes to a third party so you don't get a discount from the post office for paying early let's look at a sample invoice here we have an invoice it's dated it looks like it is dated may 12 2020 that's right around the time that i'm recording this video coincidentally and it is from bcit and it's to me amy gold list it has some important things like addresses bcit's logo importantly my customer id and over here we've got our shipping method and our terms and our delivery date this should not say 2016. let's change that to 2020. first let's look at these terms 115 and 30. so let's interpret that over here actually let's just write over here 115 and 30 rog one percent discount if paid within 15 days or the whole thing is due in 30 days the 30 days is from the receipt of goods rog stands for receipt of goods you can look up different abbreviations that's not super important for this class it just means that if we don't get it until september even though we ordered it in may it's going to take us we don't have to start paying until 30 days after september 16th even if it took six months to ship and it looks like we've got two calculators and five sets of course notes looking at this you can see how much it costs forty one dollars per calculator multiply that by two because there's two of those and uh of course notes thirty 31 dollars we multiply that by five because there's five of those we end up with 237 dollars we add in our tax we add in our delivery on top of that and we end up with 30 dollars and 44 cents authorized by and date i could sign this one myself even though it's shipped to me the important thing is this starts on september 16th 2020 so it's due on october 16 2020 30 days later now let's do a long question that has all the discounts and payments that we've done so far on november the 3rd the springfield power plant receives 10 fuel rods the rods have a list price of 20 000 each with discounts of 5 and 10 percent and payment terms of 210 115 net 30. what's the last day the invoice can be paid how much must be paid so first let's talk about how much we owe well it starts on november the 3rd and we've said net 30 and that is the same as saying n 30 but often we do just write net the last day that we can pay is december 3rd 30 days after november the 3rd if you're interested in date counting we will be looking at that in the ba 2 plus so look forward to a video about counting dates with your ba 2 plus calculator well how much are we going to pay well we have ten fuel rods each fuel rod costs twenty thousand dollars and we also have some discounts one is five percent and one is ten percent we put all of this together dump it into a calculator and we end up with a hundred and seventy one thousand dollars even so we have two discounts here what's the last day the two percent discount may be taken and how much must be paid let me just say we have two discounts we actually don't get them both we get two percent if we pay within 10 days or one percent within 15. we never get both discounts so three percent not gonna happen we only get a one percent on a two percent depending on how much we pay and when so if we add 10 days we end up with november the 3rd plus 10 days equals november the 13th easy how much do we pay well it's a hundred and seventy one thousand dollars is what we're supposed to pay but we take a bit of a discount off of there two percent to be precise which gives us a payment of a hundred and sixty seven thousand five hundred and eighty dollars that's a big discount if we look at it the amount of the discount is a hundred and seventy one thousand times 0.02 two percent of that is thirty four hundred dollars so that two percent is worth getting if we're going to save ourselves three thousand four hundred and twenty dollars almost thirty five hundred dollars let's go back to this problem we actually can't pay the entire thing at once but the supplier offers cash discounts on partial payments so what we're gonna do is pay what we can and then pay the rest later so after five days we pay a hundred thousand dollars and after another fifteen days after the invoice we pay another fifty thousand dollars now we want to know how much we owe to do this let's start with a balance sheet so november third that's our original i'm going to say within 10 days and within 15 days those are our different categories here if we pay within 15 days we get a 1 discount and if we pay within 10 days we get a 2 discount so let's start with what we owe we owe 171 000 we make our first payment within 10 days that payment is 100 000 when we try to do the discount we multiplied it by one minus two percent the opposite is dividing by one minus two percent when we go this way to the left we're going to divide so a hundred thousand dollars divided by one minus point zero two is the same as a hundred and two thousand forty dollars and eighty two cents this is a credit so we have a credit of a hundred thousand two thousand forty dollars and eighty two cents that's what comes off our account which means we now owe less money than if we made that hundred thousand dollars later we actually only owe sixty eight thousand nine hundred fifty nine dollars and eighteen cents now let's make another payment this other payment is going to be 50 000 so let's write that in but this payment was within 15 days so we get a one percent discount so we're going to divide that by that one percent so 50 000 i'm just going to simplify 1 minus 0.01 to 0.99 and it turns out that the credit for that 50 thousand dollars is 50 cents 505.05 i subtract that from 68 we owe eighteen thousand four hundred fifty four dollars and thirteen cents that's going to be the amount of the final payment okay let's just write down what we did the credit is the payment over one minus the discount the payment that we have to make is the amount we owe or the credit that we want to get times 1 minus the discount i'm going to write that we never ever see 1 plus the discount we're never going to multiply something by 1.02 or divide by 1.02 to finish off let's do one more partial payment problem but a difficult one an invoice for ten thousand dollars has payment terms 310 220 and 45. discounts are allowed for partial payments the company made a payment of three thousand dollars nine days after the date of the invoice and the second payment 18 days after the date of the invoice that reduced the balance owing to 2000. what was the size of the second payment it's a difficult one so let's look at our invoice our original one is due within 45 days if we pay within 10 days we get three percent discount and if we pay within it looks like 20 days we've got a two percent discount at the beginning it looks like we owe ten thousand dollars let's make a line here we owe ten thousand dollars now let's put in our first payment first payment was three thousand dollars and it was nine days later so it got that discount which means we actually end up with a credit of three thousand dollars over one minus 0.03 or three thousand ninety two dollars and seventy eight cents notice that i'm rounding here the rounding is a little bit contentious some people round at the middle some people round to the final step here you'll have to figure out from the supplier what they would prefer which means that now we owe six thousand nine hundred seven dollars and 22 cents let's make our next payment our next payment is something if it's something i like to call it x that x payment is worth more than it is because we get a two percent credit when i subtract this i end up with two thousand dollars so let me write that as algebra and scan this up a little bit and i have six thousand nine hundred seven dollars and 22 cents minus x over i'm going to simplify that to 0.98 equals 2 000 now i've taken my partial payment problem and i've made it an algebra problem which is easier because we know how to solve algebra problems x over 0.98 equals 6907.22 minus 2000. scroll up a little bit x equals 4907.22 times 0.98 and that gives me four thousand eight hundred nine dollars and seven cents this is the size of the second payment hi today we're going to talk about currency conversions and along the way other types of conversions as well we're going to jump straight in with question one how many canadian dollars will it take to buy 500 rubles i'm going to go over here and highlight the exchange rate and we'll look about that in a second first let's look at some rules for converting the first rule is to multiply by one multiplying by one changes nothing and that's because whatever number we have let's say uh five dollars times one equals five dollars it doesn't change anything here i know that one ruble over here is the same as 0.1783 canadian dollars or 17 canadian cents you can look up the exchange rate every day that you do calculations i fixed these ones in time but normally this is something that changes day to day depending on what's going on in the world because these two things are equal when i put one on the top and one on the bottom always using those units and putting them in it just equals one because the two things are equal top and bottom numerator and denominator again it also doesn't matter if i reverse that and put the canadian dollars on the top and one ruble on the bottom all of those fractions equal one and that leads me to rule number two always show units if you don't show units then these fractions aren't true so if i say 0.1783 over 1 equals 1 that would be incorrect it's the units the canadian and the rubles that make this equation correct okay so now let's actually solve our problem and write down our 500 rubles well that equals itself now i'm going to multiply it by a fraction so i'm gonna put that over one i'm gonna actually write that in a different color but you can always divide something by one it doesn't change anything but it does make it easier to understand the fraction i'm going to multiply that by this fraction over here so 0.1783 canadian divided by one ruble now when i look at this i've got a ruble on the top and a ruble on the bottom i'm going to cancel those out so the only units left are that cad or canadian dollars that means this is the same as 500 times 0.1783 canadian dollars or 89.15 canadian that is our equivalency so we can buy 500 rubles with 89.15 canadian and we can put that dollar sign in or not since we have the cad okay let's do the second question this time we're going to convert 500 euros into canadian dollars and see how much money we would need to buy 500 euros if i look at this expression i'm going to write this a different way one euro is equal to 1.4245 canadian when we're working with only one dollar i can use the dollar sign to mean canadian dollars this is the euro sign it looks like a c with a line through it and i can use that as well we are gonna see in our next two questions when we have two currencies that are both named dollars like canadian and u.s it's best to just use the name of the country but let's start with this so 500 euros is equal to 500 euros let's multiply that by a fraction i've got euro on the bottom so i can cancel that out and i've got dollars on the top i don't need to put the one underneath there if i'm comfortable with cross multiplying but you're welcome to cross off the euros and i am left with 500 times dollar sign 1.4245 which is the same as 712 dollars and 25 cents it takes 712 to buy 500 euros and that's because in this exchange euros are worth more than the canadian dollar while rubles are worth less so 500 rubles is only 89 canadian dollars well 500 euros is 712 canadian dollars now we're going to do a more complicated and bigger problem in this problem we're not just going to convert currency we're also going to convert our units one note in canada we use the metric system while in the united states they use the imperial system however because the us is our closest trade partner we often use u.s measurements like feet and miles and pounds when we should be using metric like meters and kilometers and kilograms that's why if you're going to work in canada it's really important to be able to convert canadian units so this time you have decided to visit the thrifty market in downtown bellingham which is just across the border in the united states you purchase a quart of black cherry pop for a dollar 25 per bottle u.s is this a better deal than canadian pop which sells for five dollars and ten cents per six pack solve the problem by changing the u.s price into canadian price per six pack i'm going to highlight those you can see here that we've used dollar sign for both canadian dollars and u.s dollars that's confusing that's why we're going to use cad for canadian and usd for us dollars and here are our measurements from above one us dollar is a dollar twelve canadian right now as i'm filming this both of our dollars are in free fall and nobody knows what will happen with the economy so i'm going to stick with numbers that got pulled out about 10 years ago okay let's start with this so the price for the u.s one is a dollar 25 and i'm going to write usd per one quart bottle i'm going to say qt means a quart okay so it's a dollar 25 per quart let's start multiplying it by things first let's get rid of that u.s dollar to do that i want a fraction with a u.s dollar on the bottom i put u.s dollar on the bottom here and the top there they'll cancel off nicely so one u.s dollar is equal to 1.1218 canadian when i do my calculations you can see that us dollar u.s dollar those nicely cancel okay now let's get rid of court so what i'm going to do is put quart on top i know over here that four quarts is one us gallon four quarts is one gallon i'm just going to say gallon and not us gallon that should be clear so now i have quart on the bottom quart on the top nicely canceled out let's add to this let's get rid of the gallon now i know that one gallon is equal to 3.7843 liters i'm just going to use capital l for liters okay now i can cross off gallon now i have something that's in canadian dollars per liter but i actually want this to be in canadian dollars per six pack the good thing about the metric system is that it's pretty easy to convert one liter let's just change colors there to make it clearer one liter is equal to a thousand milliliters liter liter disappears now we have a price per milliliter which is useful but we want to get this into cans in canada cans are about or at least in this case they're 355 milliliters milliliters is on the top to cancel at the bottom and that's one can we want this in a six pack so let me just cross out milliliter milliliter and i want to get one more thing here i have six cans is a six pack of pop can can okay i'm going to have to rewrite this whole thing because it's a big equation 1.25 times 1.1218 i'm going to leave that canadian till the end of the there but i am going to put it in i'm just doing things on the numerator at the top the one here i don't have to put that in one here i don't have to put that in but i do have to put 355 and six cans and that is cad are the units now let's do all the denominators one one one three point seven eight four three times a thousand and now that's just six pack and there we have it our units the only ones that were canceled were canadian dollars per sixpack so we have this in here now we just plug this into a calculator i'd like you guys to do this at home just so you know when you're doing these videos it's best if you're following along with your calculator you can pause me whenever you want and make sure that you got 3.16 once we round it canadian dollars six pack if you didn't that's something you should come ask me and we'll talk about your calculator and we'll go over some calculator techniques so what is it cheaper in so this is the u.s price remember and the canadian price for canadian pop is five dollars and 10 cents per sixpack and that's canadian which one would you prefer to buy well spoiler for all of these problems things are almost always cheaper in the u.s so don't be surprised if this is what happens this type of problem where we're converting both units of measurement and units of money at the same time comes up a lot in canada gas in the united states is measured in gallons and it's measured in liters here so it's important to be able to do that conversion but using this method and multiplying through and keeping careful track of our units you should never make that many mistakes only small arithmetic ones but once you get good at this you won't make mistakes hi let's format our ba2 plus calculator correctly you'll notice that my calculator is probably a different version than yours but they all work the same way notice that it says 0.00 we wanted to not show two decimal places we wanted to show all the decimal places and we're going to check to see how it's doing arithmetic if i put in 3 plus 2 times 10 i expect an answer of 23 using order of operations to know that multiplication comes before addition if we don't use order of operations and we do it incorrectly we end up with the number of 50. checking out our calculator the 3 plus 2 times 10 without putting the equals in between we get 50. that's the incorrect answer so we're going to change the formatting on this calculator we go to second and when you go to second now you get access to all the things on the top on top of the decimal place is the format press that and now it says decimal is two places we don't want that nine is the biggest we can have and if we don't put point o it means when there's nine decimal places it will show nine and when there's zero it will show zero so i'm going to press enter now i'm going to scroll up using the arrows to scroll around until i get to the chn mode that's chain mode and that's what's giving us the incorrect answer of 50. since i want algebraic order of operations or order of symbols i'm gonna go to second then press that enter again and now it says aos once i clear i can try that question again three plus 2 times 10 is 23 what we think it is let's just go over a few more settings decimal places we've seen that one if i scroll down we get degrees if you're going to be doing calculus or engineering math you might need to know the difference between degrees and radians not necessary for this course this is our date mode if you are european and you're used to day month year instead of month day year you might wish to change it but our textbook and all of the notes we do are going to assume we're using us mode next us mode shows a comma as a thousand separator and a decimal place separates the fractions or a fraction of a cent we could set this to european mode which uses space as a thousand separator and the comma for decimals but in canada we use the us mode finally we get back down to aos clear out of that notice it doesn't say 0.00 and our calculator is set correctly final question question 3 you are planning a winter surfing vacation you will begin on the north shore in hawaii try to catch the 50year storm at bells beach australia and finish your trip with a little longboarding on new zealand's north island you estimate you will need 500 in each currency how much canadian will you need to spend i'm just going to separate that i've highlighted the currencies that we're going to use canadian australian new zealand and usa unfortunately they're all dollars which is why we're going to use the abbreviations and those are official abbreviations so let's start with how much we need so we need 500 us dollars we need 500 australian dollars and we need 500 new zealand dollars we can do all of these and we're going to put this all together into one equation and do it all at the same time by multiplying each one by a fraction 500 us dollars times well we've done this one before 1.1218 canadian dollars equals one u.s dollar plus 500 australian dollars well that is 84 cents over one australian dollar plus our 500 new zealand dollars and we know that one new zealand dollar is equal to 71 canadian cents let's work this out all we have to do is cancel off those units and do some multiplication in addition i'm going to dump that into a calculator and come up with 1340.45 canadian looking at these currencies which one is more valuable well that's going to be the u.s dollar the us dollar is worth more than the canadian dollar the canadian dollar is worth more than the australian dollar because one canadian dollar is 84 cents australian but one canadian dollar is a dollar twelve canadian and australian is stronger than the new zealand dollar that's because 84 australian cents is equal to 72 ish new zealand cents okay now let's do part b when you land in auckland new zealand you discover that you still have 65 us dollars and 90 australian dollars in your wallet you'd like to exchange that for new zealand currency since we don't have exchange rates from new zealand from us dollars to new zealand dollars we're going to have to do an intermediate calculation to canadian so let's write what we have we have 65 u.s dollars plus 90 australian dollars and we're going to convert that i'm going to zoom this up so 65 usd and i'm going to multiply that and change it into canadian because that's the only thing i know how to do but i'm also going to change it into new zealand so let's change that in from canadian to a new zealand dollar we know that one new zealand dollar is 71 cents canadian and when i look at my conversions us us cancels canadian canadian cancels and i'm left with just new zealand on the top i'm going to do the next one in the exact same expression i've got 90 australian dollars and i'm going to change that from australian into canadian and here this is worth 84 cents now it's in canadian now i'm going to change that the same way i did before into new zealand one new zealand dollar is 71.68 canadian cents i go through australian australian canadian canadian i'm just going to rewrite this expression because it will be easier 65.1.12 over 0.7168 canadian sorry not canadian new zealand that's what we were left with here and here plus 90 times 0.8423 divided by 0.7168 canadian i put that into my calculator and end up with 207 dollars and 48 cents and that's new zealand dollars just one more note here we've simplified things a little bit when you exchange money the bank takes a cut so you're not going to get the exact amount a little percentage is going to go towards whoever is exchanging the money that's the reason they do it we're going to ignore that in this instance because we're looking at a little bit simplified but think of that as more of a fee hi we're going to use the ba 2 calculator to compute some dates we're going to start with an example an invoice stated june 1st 2010 is due in 45 days find the due date let's highlight that okay so first thing we start by going second and then the date date is on top of one we're going to put in the date 6.010 i'm going to write this down so six stands for june which is the sixth month june 1st nope that we have to put a zero there if it is one digit long and this is the last two digits of 2010 okay so to put that in we go 6.0110 and then we have to press enter to store it now i want to know 45 days later i'm going to scroll down to dbd dpd is days between dates so the days between dates here is going to be 45 enter now let's go and back up to date two and all i have to do is press compute to find out that it was friday july 16 2010 let's do another one let's figure out how old a person might be in days so let's say go back up to date one let's say someone was born on september 15th 1990. in that case their name their date would be 09 or just 9 for september 15 9 0. so i'm going to go 9.15 enter and today's date i'm going to go down today's date is actually may which is 5 dot the 17th 2020 press enter when i scroll down to days between days all i have to do is press compute to find out that it's 10 837 days finally what day of the week was i born or a fictional person scrolling back up to date one we can find this very easy once we have three things in here we can just compute the other one and it tells us that september 15 1990 was actually a saturday finally let's look at the last item dbd down to act and if we go one more we're back to date one act stands for actual that's a 365 days plus leap year every so often every four years the other calendar we can do is 360. that's going to be a calendar that has 12 months of 30 days each or 360 days we don't use this one because the earth takes in a bit days to revolve around the sun even though 360 would be easier math so we keep that at act i'm just going to write 360. that's a fictional calend calculator calendar and that is oh hi we're going to talk about cost equations today a cost equation is linear so it's of the form y equals a plus b x and just so you know if you learned this in high school you might have seen this as y equals m x plus b same thing different words i like to say y equals intercept plus slope times x okay for costs we have an equation that looks like cost equals fixed cost plus variable cost per item times the number of items or c equals fc plus bc x i'm going to draw this here we've got our axes and we're going to draw a line we have our intercept a here and we've got a slope so our line looks something like this let's just turn that ruler around and draw in a line okay the slope is the variable cost let's jump into question one you're concerned about your cell phone bill for this month and you can't remember how your plan actually works you've been careful to keep track of how much data you used each month and the month this month that you've used 160 megabytes using the payment information from your online banking you compile the following what is the independent variable and what is the dependent variable so here cost equations are easier in that cost is always going to be the dependent variable and x is the independent i like to say that y depends on x here cost depends on data used the more data you use the more expensive it will be to put this into a function we have cost equals we've got some sort of base rate no matter what we're not going to get away with using it for free we're going to pay a certain base plus we have some sort of price per megabyte times the num amount of data used so cost is going to depend on the data used part b use a graph to determine the amount of your cell phone bill for this month i've gone ahead and put a graph in here usually we use computers for these or graph paper works perfectly well i'm going to put in my points x is the megabytes used y is the cost so we have our points when we used 120 megabytes we spent 40 dollars let's put that mb in there when we used 80 megs we ended up spending only 30 dollars and when we had 200 megabytes we used ended up paying 60 so those are our three points a line is determined by two points so three is just extra drawing this i've gone ahead and labeled all my axes and i've used units and i know i don't have the neatest handwriting but i try so let's draw in these plans let's use red so what we're going to do is put in those points so 120 40. 120 on the xaxis 40 on the yaxis 80 30. that's going to be halfway here finally we have 260. that is over here on this and when i line those three points up they look like a line i'm going to use a ruler to try to get this perfect and again when you're freehanding it it doesn't matter if it's perfect but it's a nice thing we can do there's our line so looking at that question what do you think our the amount of our cell phone bill is this month remember this month we used 160 megabytes so what we're going to do is look over here and i think this month right around there i'm going to assume it's around 50 looking at a graph isn't precise but often it's good enough for whatever we are trying to do part c determine the slope of the line in the graph and describe the slope in the words of the problem this is a review from high school work which you might remember slope is defined as rise over run otherwise known as the change in y over the change in x we can look at that as any two points we take y2 minus y1 and we divide that by that is an error x2 minus x1 lovely this is going to be our variable cost in this case let's pick two points i'm going to pick two of them that look easy enough for i'm going to choose as my two points the following for point number one i'm going to say 80 30. when we used 80 megabytes it cost us 30 and for 0.2 i'm going to say that when we used 120 megabytes it cost us 40 dollars those are the points i'm going to use so the slope is going to be the rise the change in the money or cost 40 minus 30 over the run which is going to be 1 120 minus 180 make sure that your units match up there okay when i put that in i get 10 over 40 or 0.25 and i'll write that in the words of the problem for each additional megabyte i use i'm going to pay an extra 25 cents i'm going to make a note here let's say we had flipped our y1 and y2 in that case i'd end up with 30 minus 40 over 80 minus 120 megabytes in this case what i end up with is negatives here i have negative 10 over negative 40 which still equals 0.25 the order doesn't matter as long as i am consistent if we don't pay our cell phone at all for the month of october how much will you have to pay well let's scroll up and look at that for 0 megabytes we have what is the intercept it looks like somewhere around halfway between 0 and 20 so i'm going to go with around ten dollars i'm going to call this by inspection which means i looked and i didn't do any actual arithmetic finally let's determine the equation of the line in the graph looking at it we know at the slope and we know that we will end up with costs equals fixed costs plus variable cost times x we suspect that the fixed cost is somewhere around 7 and we know what the slope is i'm going to put in one of the points and here i just choose any point that i would like 80 megabytes cost 30 either of these points is fine so i'm going to put that in here knowing that the variable cost is 25 cents now i'm going to put in 30 for c and 80 for x i'm just going to leave off the megabytes because it's not necessary but now we have this it ends up being fc equals 30 dollars minus 0.25 times 80 and we can just run that through a calculator and we get ten dollars which is actually what we guessed in the previous uh examples so that is true d now let's look at how much c is our slope and that is already there so now let's just check our work by putting in every single point so x equals 120 cost equals 10 dollars plus 25 cents times 120 that's 40 dollars correct now let's put in x equals 80 megabytes now our cost is going to be 10 times 25 cents times 80 and that is 30 just like we want it to finally our last point was 200 megabytes cost equals 10 times 25 cents times 200 megabytes and we end up with 60 dollars those are the points that we're looking for finally i want to just verify part b so b said what happens when we make a hundred and sixty so when we use 160 megabytes our cost should be 10 plus 25 cents times 160 megabytes running this through a calculator equals 50. which is the amount that we estimated hi continuing on with question one let's look at a different company remember the cell phone bill on the company that we have is the cost is 10 connection fee per month plus 25 cents for every megabyte used part f another company offers a cell phone plan that costs 20 dollars per month and charges 15 cents per megabyte determine the cost equation and graph it using the same grid this time instead of having two points the line is given to us in words we can look at this and say that cost is going to be twenty dollar fixed costs plus fifteen cents times x where x is the amount of megabytes used remember the line that we found in part b and we graph that on the line now we're going to graph this second cell phone plan on the exact same line i'm going to do that by finding two points this time i wasn't given any points so i'm going to have to find them usually using the intersection point or when x equals zero is going to be the best choice when x equals zero the cost or y is equal to twenty dollars so that gives me the point zero twenty let's put that in purple okay now let's think about one more point here we can choose anything we'd like but it makes sense to come up with a simple number to use i've chosen to use x equals 200 here because i think it will be fairly simple when x equals 200 the cost is going to be 20 plus 15 cents times 200 put that into a calculator and it comes up with 50 dollars that gives me the point 250 easy enough to use 200 let's find 50 right over here so now we have two points all we have to do is connect them with a straight line perfect let's put a bracket there now we have our two points together now what we're going to do is compare our two plants sometimes one of them is cheaper and sometimes another one of them is cheaper so let's look at plan one if we are going to spend 175 megabytes then our cost will be 10 plus 25 cents for each of those 175 megabytes which is 53 and 75 cents plan 2 on the other hand is more expensive for its connection fee but cheaper otherwise only 15 cents a megabyte so when i put that in i get 46.25 i can kind of see that let's look at 175. it's about here i can see that plan two is more it's cheaper it's lower on the line than plan one mark in that plan one is in red different prices what's happening here is that if you don't spend any plan two is going to be more expensive if we don't use it at all it's a twenty dollar fee as opposed to ten dollars but if we spend 200 megabytes it will be 60 on plan 1 but only 50 on plan 2. what we're going to look at is the point at which they're the same by inspection looking at this it looks like somewhere between 80 and 120 somewhere around 100 our two plans will have the same cost when it we spend less than this amount use less data plan one would be cheaper if we use more data plan two is cheaper to find that point what we're going to do is solve some equations i'm just going to highlight over here in g that plan 2 was cheaper so what i'm going to do is solve a system of equations cost 1 equals cost 2 and i'm going to solve for x cost 1 well that was 10 plus 25 cents a megabyte i'm going to change colors here to say cost 2 was 20 plus only 15 cents per megabyte to solve this equation i'm going to move all the x terms to the left and all the constants to the right now i get 25 x minus 15 x 15.15 x equals 20 minus 10. notice that i'm leaving all those units in there that is 10 cents times x equals 10 dollars or x equals 10 over 0.10 which gives me exactly 100 megabytes that was what this looked like by inspection this looked to be at about a hundred the cost is the same there so in conclusion if we average more than 100 megabytes per month two is going to be cheaper if we average less than 100 megabytes per month plan one will be cheaper so the conclusion is we're going to take our use patterns and figure out which plan is best question two let's do one more linear equation that is a costing equation babysitters r us charges a flat booking fee plus an hourly rate on a normal workday i hire a sitter for nine hours and i pay dollars and 50 cents on saturday nights i usually hire a sitter for four hours while i go to the movies and i pay 66 dollars find a linear equation giving cost in terms of the number of hours so this is a question where we have two points and we're trying to find the linear equation between them so first of all the independent and dependent variable cost is always the dependent variable in a costing equation so we have here cost depends on time time is always independent costing is dependent remember we say why it depends on x cost depends on it time is never the dependent variable because it's strange to say that time is going to change based on other things unless you had a time machine which would be very cool so what we're doing is this and we have an equation that looks like cost equals intercept plus slope times x our intercept here is going to be our fixed cost or booking fee so let's say actually i'm going to call this a booking fee that's our fixed cost here plus our hourly rate times the number of hours so that's what i'm trying it to find let's look at our two points i'm going to draw these here points and let's cut x comma y well i know nine hours on a work day gives me a fee of 123 dollars and 50 cents i know that on my movie day only four hours i only pay 66 dollars that means that i have my y values are in money and my x values are in time so first let's find that slope so slope again is rise over run or y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 y's over x's putting those in i'm going to start with this one because they're bigger numbers and i always like to put the bigger numbers first 123 dollars and 50 cents minus 66 dollars nine minus four putting in the units really ensures that you don't mix things up if i run this through a calculator we come up with eleven dollars and fifty cents that is our hourly weight we pay our sitter eleven dollars and fifty cents we're going to assume that they get some of that booking fee to bring them up to minimum wage so let's look again at our costing equation cost equals our booking fee or i'm going to call it this time fixed cost fc plus 1150 times x so we can plug in any one point and that will help us solve and we can choose either of these points i'm going to choose the second point just because it's smaller numbers and i find that often smaller numbers tend to be a little bit easier to work with but not always so our cost is 66 dollars that equals fixed costs plus 1150 times four when i move this around and this is something where if this is not easy for you to solve this that fixed cost is 20 come talk to me send me an email go over some algebra things and we will get that nicely sorted because this is an important thing to know another important thing to do is to check so i put in the second point so let's try the first point so if i put in 9 hours the cost will be i've said i had a 20 flat rate plus nine hours times 11.50 and when i dump that in it ends up being 123.50 just what we wanted and just to check even though we used it we can always just check the four hour cost so 20 dollars plus 1150 times 4 is equal to 66 that's correct if we got the wrong answer here then we would know to stop and redo our arithmetic okay let's describe the slope in the words of the problem we know that the slope is the hourly rate so i'm going to say one slope equals hourly rate so for every additional hour we have to pay our sitter an extra 11.50 notice that i used the following the actual slope the word additional hour and what's going on we're paying an extra eleven fifty we're paying that flat rate plus what we paid before and every additional hour cost us 11.50 extra finally part c if i hire a sitter for six hours how much will it cost me well i'm going to write down our cost equation again our cost is going to be twenty dollars no matter how much time i use you have it a babysitter come for five minutes it's gonna cost you at least twenty dollars plus eleven dollars and fifty cents per hour so if x equals six hours then our cost is going to be twenty dollars plus eleven fifty times six which equals eighty nine dollars that's how much we're going to pay our sitter hi today we're going to jump right in to lecture six break even analysis by going straight into a problem break even analysis is sometimes called cvp the c stands for cost the v stands for volume and the p stands for profit break even is what our calculator uses and there we're going to learn more about that later so let's jump right in the hungry days ice cream company has fixed costs of thirty thousand dollars per month each case of ice cream costs four dollars and fifty cents to make write an equation giving total cost as a function of the number of cases of ice cream made we're going to graph that in the space below well we know from last time that our cost cost equation is fixed costs plus variable costs times x where x is the quantity so in our case we have thirty thousand dollars plus four dollars and fifty cents for every carton case of ice cream let's write that in so i'm going to scroll a little bit and by the way k little aside 60k is 60 000. k stands for kilo which comes from the greek word for thousand i use that when i draw legends because i don't like writing all those zeros my hand gets tired a computer besides one that i write on would be very helpful i've gone ahead and labeled this because i know what the axes when you're doing this in the real world you'll often be using excel or a graphing program so i'm going to label it every five is going to be ten thousand dollars on the yaxis costing is always on the yaxis and i've put 2500 for every five blocks on the xaxis so let's start with cost our intercept is going to be zero when i have zero cases of ice cream our cost is thirty thousand dollars so zero thirty thousand dollars now i'm going to come up with something else i've chosen five thousand because that seems to be a nice easy number then y or the cost equals thirty thousand plus four fifty times five thousand and when i run that into a calculator i get the point five thousand 52 500. okay let's put that on 5000 is a nice dark line and 52 500 seems to be right about here now i've got that on my list on my chart i go ahead and put in a nice straight line and i can even label that as my cost equation okay part b the company sells ice cream for 12 dollars per case give an equation for the revenue function and graph the revenue below here price actually i'm gonna switch this to purple why not price is 12 dollars per case revenue is the same as sales and that's always going to be defined as price times quantity sometimes quantity is done as q for quantity we often use x because that's what's used in algebra for unknowns when i put in what i have for this i end up with revenue i'm calling that r is 12 x if i sell x cases of ice cream i make 12 times x in price scrolling up i'm going to write this again over here let's put this on the exact same chart the intercept of revenue is easy if we sell no ice cream we make no money expect zero zero to be a point on every revenue graph now i'm going to go with something that looks equally easy if i sell 5 000 cases of ice cream then i make 12 times 5 is 60 000 in sales so five thousand sixty right at the top again all i have to do is put in my ruler line everything up the nicer you line this up the easier it is to really see what's going on and now we can see where these cross okay let's label our graph this is the important part profit loss and break even i'm going to go back to what we talked about in the very first lecture i'm pretty sure in the very first video profit is revenue or sales minus cost when profit is greater than zero we're in a profit situation when profit is less than zero let's put that as a dollar sign we're in a loss situation and when profit is exactly zero this is what we call the break even point this is what the purpose of this lecture is we're always going to be trying to figure out what the breakeven point is the minimum sales to not lose money it's okay if we make a little bit of money but if we lose money we're in a bad situation we want to be in a positive situation okay so looking at our graph this time we're just gonna eyeball it i'm gonna go ahead and highlight this i'm even going to put a little line there right at that point and it looks like it's a nice even point and we have on the yellow side over here our costs are higher than our revenues so i'm going to write revenue here in purple when our cost is higher than our revenue this is a loss situation when our profit when our revenue is higher than our costs over here this is a profit situation so if we sell more than somewhere around 4 000 we'll be in a profit and if we sell less than that we will be in a loss okay part d let's calculate the break even point we're going to express it in multiple ways so looking at our chart earlier scroll up we think it's somewhere around 4 000 but now we're going to look at that algebraically so the breakeven point comes when profit equals zero and since profit is revenue minus cost that's the exact same as saying that revenue and costs are equal so we're looking from when those two things are the same so i'm gonna put in our equations revenue was 12 x and cost was three thirty thousand dollars plus 450 x solve this i'm going to move everything over to the same side i've got 12x minus 4.50 x equals 30 000 or 12 minus 4.5 i'm factoring out the x so i end up with 7.5 x equals 30 000 so x is 30 000 divided by 7.5 which is the same as 4 000 cases that's our breakeven and that's what it looked like on our chart so let's write that down break even is four thousand cases in sales we would need to sell well it's twelve dollars per case so if we sold forty eight thousand dollars worth of material worth of ice cream we would be at break even so we need to sell 4 000 cases of ice cream or we need to bring in 48 000 worth in sales and at that point our costs are also going to be 48 thousand dollars let's look at this capacity we cannot sell a million cases of ice cream we can't because our factory won't work so we have a capacity we always have a capacity so our factory and our staff and all the materials we have can only make 16 000 per month and there's always a limit if you think back to the very first day we talked about sam and charlie and their lemonade stand they can't suddenly sell 200 million liters of lemonade they are just two kids with a stand so our factory can only make 16 000 per month after that our calculations change because our fixed costs will change we will need to upgrade our factory we will need to hire more people things are going to change so what we're going to do is say we need to sell 4 000 of our 16 000 maximum or 25 of capacity to break even this is a good thing to look at if it turns out we need to sell 90 of capacity that doesn't give us a lot of room to get to sell more and we have to sell quite a lot that's not a great business case if we only need to sell five percent of capacity then maybe we're in a good position we need to know these numbers okay going back to this problem let's calculate our profit or loss if 4001 cases are sold so profit equals revenue minus cost this time i'm going to write this with variables before i put in our numbers profit is revenue revenue is price times quantity and quantity is x cost is going to be fixed costs plus variable cost times x moving this around i end up with price minus variable costs x i've moved it around and i factored that out minus the fixed costs one thing to make sure of is the minus here in the brackets distributes i'm going to write that down because it's an easy thing to forget so price minus variable cost times x minus fixed costs we've seen this before in our case we got to the point where 12 minus 450 x minus 30 000 that number price minus variable costs is something that we call the contribution margin another way to think of that is the gross profit per item that's what we were looking at in chapter one any time we calculated our margins and markups we were usually looking at that gross profit per item or markup in dollars those all mean the same thing that happens a lot in business math we end up with the same idea but expressed differently in this case we had 750x minus 30 000 that's the profit equation for happy days ice cream 750 is our profit margin okay where am i going with this let's go back to profit or lost if 4001 cases are sold so if x equals 4001 there's an extra zero there i have profit equals 750 times 4001 minus 30 000 putting that into my calculator i end up with 3007.5 oh minus 30 000 which gives me 750 that's the contribution margin that isn't a coincidence so i'm going to say the first 4 000 cases pay off the fixed costs every additional case contributes contributes contribution seven dollars and fifty cents to the net profit and in this case we are talking about net profit because we're subtracting the fixed costs that means if i had if we sell x equals 4002 cases our profits net profits are going to be two times seven dollars and fifty cents or fifteen dollars okay let's calculate the profit or loss if 3 250 cases are sold i'm going to scroll back up to look at our chart if we look over here this our breakeven point was at 4 000 cases 4001 gave us a profit of 750 but anything below 4 000 was a loss situation we know before we do any arithmetic at all that we're going to end up with a loss so we know going in no matter what happens we're going to lose money but anyways we're going to go and work this out our profit we've already said that once we've come up with this equation 750x minus thirty thousand dollars we can just plug this in so 750 times 3250 minus 30 000 is going to give us negative six two five so anytime we have a negative profit we have a loss of five thousand six hundred and twenty five dollars once we have that profit equation we can use it to solve all sorts of things let's say our company wants to make a profit of 75 000 how many cases must they sell first of all we know it's going to be more than four thousand because four thousand had a profit of zero so let's just write that in we know it's more than four thousand cases but what we're going to do is set profit equals revenue minus costs equals 75 000. in our case we know what profit is profit is that contribution margin times x minus the fixed costs 750x minus 30 000 equals 75 000. moving over the thirty thousand dollars it moves from a negative to a positive we end up with x equals i'm going to write this whole thing in 105 000 over 7.50 which is thousand dollars sorry fourteen thousand cases i'm going to say this is possible since it is under capacity if we need to sell 20 000 cases i'm going to write down we can't do that anything over 16 000 is impossible because our factory only fits 14 thousand finally we're going to play around with the structure hungry days is considering dropping its prices and would like to make a profit of eighty two thousand dollars by selling sixteen thousand cases what should the new price be what is the break even in units so now things are changing our price is not twelve dollars anymore our price is something different so we're going to need a new profit equation always start with profit equals revenue minus costs what i'm going to do over here is write down all the things we have fixed costs variable costs price quantity and profit i'm going to write q or x and that's because we're going to talk about how the ba 2 calculator does this later our fixed costs didn't change our variable costs well those also didn't change our price is what we don't know x well we want to sell 16 000 cases so i'm gonna put that in a sixteen thousand if we sell our full capacity our profit will be eighty two thousand dollars once i have four out of these five items i can just solve for the rest using the profit equation so my profit is 82 000 equals revenue well revenue is going to be price times x and x is sixteen thousand minus the costs well that's going to be four dollars and fifty cents times sixteen thousand minus because i don't actually let's put brackets in here then that's going to be plus 30 000 our fixed costs once i put this together what we're going to do is clean up this equation moving the sides over i'm going to say 16 000 times price minus what goes in this whole bracket dump that into a calculator and it's a hundred and two thousand that equals eightytwo thousand so now i have price equals 82 000 plus 102 000 over 16 000 putting that into a calculator that is going to equal 184 000 over 16 000 which is 11.50 so our new price is 11.50 to find the break even in units all we have to do is the even equation so break even is just revenue is the same as costs our revenue is now 11.50 times x but our cost remains the same at thirty thousand dollars plus four dollars and fifty cents times x giving us eleven dollars 11.50 minus 450 as our contribution margin equals 30 000 that is going to end up with 1150 minus 450 is a contribution margin of seven dollars so we have x equals thirty thousand dollars divided by seven thousand dollars again noting those dollar signs disappear and we get 4285.71428 let's stop and look at that number can we sell 0.714 of a case of ice cream not really we're not selling carton by carton we're selling an entire case to our distributor so we have a key here always round up never round down if we round down we end up with a tiny loss that is not okay losing five cents is a loss a tiny profit is okay so we would prefer to end up up by five cents then down by five cents so we're always going to round up and say we need to sell 4 286 cases of ice cream let's do one last question question two rain city umbrellas does a thriving business and selling umbrellas each month they spend one thousand fifty seven dollars on rent for their prime umbrella kiosk and two thousand dollars on a salary for their sales person just highlight those numbers they also buy umbrellas wholesale for 750 per umbrella got a different color and then they sell each umbrella for 26 dollars to wet tourists find their break even point in sales so let's start by writing out all the elements of our formula we've got our fixed costs our variable costs are price so fixed costs here is going to be there's actually two things we're going to add together both rent and salaries gives us seven 3057. our variable cost is going to be seven dollars and fifty cents per umbrella that's how much it costs and our price is going to be twenty six dollars those are the variables we have our revenue is then twenty six dollars per umbrella x is the number of umbrellas our cost is going to be that 3057. plus an extra 7.50 for every umbrella we make to find the break even we set profit equals zero or we just do revenue equals costs those are equivalent so let's do revenue equals costs we have 26x equals 3057 plus 750 x we move things over 26 minus 750 x equals 3057. that's the same as x equals 3057 over 18.50 and just to write down 1850 is our contribution margin or our gross profit per item that's nice to know it's pretty healthy profit margins in umbrellas solving this we end up with x equals 165 we know we can't sell a quarter of umbrella of an umbrella so let's look if we sell 165 umbrellas then our profit is going to be well that would end up being negative four dollars and 50 cents and that's by putting in just our revenue minus cost so i'm writing in the equation put an extra minus there 3057. if we sell 166 umbrellas our profit ends up being exactly 14 dollars here we have something going on this is a loss losses are not good if we sold 166 that would be a small profit and that's okay so we need to sell 166 umbrellas not 165 or because it the question asked for sales we need to make twenty six dollars times 166 which is the same as 4300 or 4316 dollars in sales hi welcome to lesson seven simple interest today we're going to start talking about time value money how money changes over time and the key here is time value money i'm going to write that down because this is going to come up again and again and that's the shortcut on our calculator this works via interest interest is money that you earn on investments in that case high rates are best or interest is the money that we pay on loans in that case low rates are best which case every problem we have we're going to have to decide am i borrowing money or am i investing money and that's how we're going to pick the basic which one is better so let's look at the two basic types of interest and those are simple and compound they are used for different things simple is what we're going to do today and in our next lesson we're going to talk about compound interest which is used more often however starting with simple we're going to come to a basic equation and everything we do is going to stem from this and that is going to be i equals p r t where i is the interest earned p is the principal whatever we invest or borrow and r is the interest rate i'm going to put annual there because that's important we're going to see this and t is time in years to illustrate what i really mean by time value money i'm going to give you a choice would you rather have one hundred dollars today or would you prefer to have one hundred dollars next year same amount of money different time well i don't know about you but i would prefer to have money today that's basically what we're doing we're trying to figure out today versus next year but let's change this now what would you prefer one hundred dollars today or two hundred dollars next year this is a harder question me personally i'm okay with waiting until next year but you might need the money now that's what's going to do how much does something have to be worth in the future to make it equally valuable so for the rest of the course we're going to be dealing with this question what's better money now or money later if we have less now and more later when are those things going to be the same or equivalent to us we're gonna jump right into a problem question one you deposit a thousand dollars into a bank that pays ten percent simple how much interest would you earn if you left the money in for two years for this whole question we're going to be using the equation i equals prt our p or principal is a thousand dollars that's how much money we're investing today our r sorry about that is going to be 10 simple which is the same as 0.10 and our t is going to vary so part a two years and since t is measured in years t is going to be two in this case i'm going to set this up i equals p r t is one thousand dollars times ten percent times two and when i put that in we've made two hundred dollars in interest let's write that down we have two hundred dollars in interest we have a future value this is something we're going to be talking about a lot of fv equals well we have the one thousand dollars we had and then we add 200 which means now we've got 1200 dollars okay let's go on to part b what if t is six months in this case what we're going to do is translate t into years and we can do this by using our conversions from chapter one there are 12 months in a year so six times months times a year divided by 12 months equals 6 over 12 years or 0.5 years for a lot of these unit conversions in time it's going to be simple to do it in your head six months is half a year but for other questions when we start talking about quarters and days it'll be easier to do an official unit conversion so be aware of that i'm going to cross off those months just so this looks good so let's look at how much interest we have i equals p r t our principal is still a thousand dollars our r is still 0.10 but our time is now 0.5 which means we have made 50 dollars in interest let's try that one more time what if t equals 9 months in this case that's the same as 9 over 12 years or 0.75 you should have i equals 75 one of the important things about simple interest is that we often use things on a daily rate so we end up counting days a lot in the review for chapter one there's a video on how to use the date calculator for your ba two plus i encourage you to check that out so what we're going to do is go from march 3rd to november the 7th so march 3rd on our calculator is going to be march that's the third month 03 third day and it doesn't matter what year we choose so i'm going to choose 20 because that's this year november 7th well that's going to be the 11th month the 7th day and again i'm going to go with 2020. going over to our calculator i'm going to go to this date function which is above 1 and set my first date as 3.0320 enter scroll down my second date is 11.07 enter i'm going down to dvd which was days between days and i'm going to press compute that tells me that it's 249 days so in that case i have t is 249 days and in order to change that into years i'm going to remember that one year is 365 days we're just always going to stick with 365 days for this class if you're doing something where you need to worry about leap years you'll be using a computer so what i'm going to use is 249 divided by 365 years as my t value i'm going to leave that as a fraction so now i have i equals p r t again for this whole question it's one thousand times 10 times 249 over 365. put that into a calculator and i'm going to do that clearing out of my dates 1000 times 0.1 times 249 divided by 365 that is 68.22 cents okay i'm going to make some notes about dates one of the notes is save all of our digits the best practice is to just use a fraction in our calculator that's why we didn't compute what 249 over 365 is leap year let's write this down every four years we have 366 days and it's even more complicated than that that every 100 years or so we skip the leap year and every thousand dollars we skip the skipping thousand dollars it's thousand years guys okay and i'm going to say in this course we will always use 365. as the base or denominator don't worry about 366. for today for this course we're just going to ignore leap year and i'm going to make sure that no calculations take place over leap year what i would like you to do now is to pause this video and do the next three questions okay you should have for these questions t equals 261 over 365 t equals 123 over 365 and t equals 328 over 365. that should give you the following interest calculations 71.50 and 70 cents and 89 and 86 cents one thing i'm gonna note every time we do something like this that is not what i was trying to do let me try that again eh good enough okay here our interest is linear if we get one hundred dollars after one year we get two hundred dollars after two year and three hundred dollars after three year now that we know how to find the interest we're going to solve for other variables first we're going to start with finding the principal on december the 1st your oneyear term deposit comes due when you collect the principal plus 120 in interest the term deposit paid six percent simple interest how much money did you deposit let's start with our equation everything we do starts with this i equals prt a linear equation solving for p means moving r and t to the other side p equals i divided by rt i is 102 dollars p well that's what we're looking for r that's going to be six percent or 0.06 and t is one year putting that together we end up with p equals 120 divided by 0.06 times one or one twenty divided by point zero six is two thousand dollars even so we invested two thousand dollars let's try that one more time 18 months ago you purchased a bond that paid 7.5 simple interest you cashed on the bond and received the principal plus 337 dollars and 50 cents in interest find the principal again pause and work this out okay p equals i divided by r t 337.50 divided by seventy five zero point seven five times one point five putting that all in three thousand dollars now we're going to solve for time on may 31st you decided it was time to start a new life in the palm trees you emptied out your bank account you received your principal of 1750 an interest of dollars and 50 cents how long had your money been in the bank if the account paid interest at five percent simple so let's write this down again i equals p r t when we solve for t we end up with i divided by p times r so let's look at all the things we have i p equals p rt our interest is going to be 437.50 our principal is 1750. our rate is five percent simple and time well that's what we're going to solve for so now i put this into my equation t equals i divided by p times r i'm going to put this into the calculator so you can see how i do that 437.5 divided by 1750 and i like to press equals and then divide by 0.05 and i end up with 5. and t is always measured in years does it matter that it's may 31st not really let's do this again question 5. on your 65th birthday you eagerly cash in one of your rrsps or retirement savings plan you receive a total of four thousand two hundred ninety five dollars your original investment was three thousand and your interest was paid at seven percent simple how many months was your money in the rrsp this is a slightly more complicated problem because we don't have our interest instead we have a future value of four thousand two hundred and ninety five dollars that is principal plus interest together our principal is three thousand dollars three thousand dollars plus what equals four thousand two hundred five well we know that we must have made 1295 in interest which is 4295 minus 3 000. our interest rate is seven percent and our t is what we're looking for and we're looking for it in months which we're going to get to at the end i'm going to scroll up a little bit and start again with t by our formula before t equals p over sorry i over p times r i will fix that so when i put that in i end up with 1 295 divided by 3 000 times 0.07 let's look at that on the calculator one two nine five divided by three thousand dollars equals and divide that by .07 and i usually like to do my division in two steps like that and i end up with six point one six six six six seven and remember this is in years six and a bit years to get this into months the way we want well i'm going to have to remember that one year is 12 months writing down this formal calculation helps us to make sure that we divide and multiply properly so i'm going to multiply this times 12 and once i do that you'll see that it is exactly 74 months finally in time we're going to look at this question how long will it take to double your money at eight percent simple well i've got so let's start with i equals p r t i know that r is eight percent and i know that t is what i'm looking for but i don't know i or p so my tip is going to be pick any p just like we did in chapter one we don't know a number we can make something up because everything is proportional i always use one hundred dollars when i can a thousand one all good answer if i invest a hundred dollars then to double it makes i going to be also a hundred dollars or future value is 200 100 plus 100 so if i make a hundred dollars in interest i've doubled it so i've got t equals i over p times r or 100 divided by 100 times 0.08 notice that the 100 is the same on the top on the bottom no matter what number i chose it would end up that way so all i have to do is divide take point zero eight and say one divided by that there's a handy button for this on the calculator 12.5 years now we're going to solve for r same equation exact same thing except this time i equals p rt we're solving for r when we rearrange this we get r equals i divided by p times t on march the sixth you deposit three thousand dollars into a bank account you withdraw the principal and interest totaling three thousand one hundred twenty three dollars and 29 cents on december the 31st what interest rate was paid so what we're going to do is see which things we need to do here we deposited three thousand dollars that's the principle our interest is going to be 123.29 or the future value minus the principal three thousand one hundred twenty three dollars and twenty nine cents minus three thousand dollars i'm just gonna rehighlight that r well that's what we are solving for at this time and t i'm going to put this in already but i would like you guys to take the time pause if you'd like and show that you can do in the calculator finding out that march the 6th to december 31st is 300 days i'm gonna remind you that date one is march the sixth third month sixth day uh let's pretend it's 2020. some people like to present it's 2 000 then you don't have to put anything in at all and it goes until december 31st and you're computing days between days so you can go ahead and do that on your own let's put this in r equals 123.29 divided by 3 000 times 300 over 365. this is a little more tricky to do i'm going to show you how to do this on the calculator if you're familiar with algebra you might want to simplify this expression but what i'm going to do is start with the bottom putting this into the calculator 300 days divided by 365 equals i'm gonna multiply that by three thousand dollars that's the denominator now what i'm going to do is use that 1 over x button to put it on the bottom and multiply it by 123.29 that gives me almost exactly five percent that's a nice even number forgetting about the round off one more on december 16 2011 you withdrew your entire christmas fund of 2098.63 from your account you deposited 2 000 on february 19th 2011. what simple interest was paid i want you guys to pause writing that down and then i will show you the answer ready here's the answer we end up with six percent make sure that you can count those days and get 300 days if not this is a really good thing to talk to me about during lab okay finally we're ready to solve for the future value the future value is the principal plus the interest how much money we have in the future you've decided to start a new car fund you deposit six thousand dollars into an account paying 10 simple how much money will you have in 50 months okay so let's look at this future value is principal plus i i equals p r t that means that future value is principal plus principal times r t what we can do is factor out this p and we get 1 plus r t this is a formula that we're going to see a lot of and if i want to go backwards because we're going to see this p equals fv divided by 1 plus rt these are new equations that we're going to see are sometimes easier to use in this case i never need to solve for i so f b p r t future value is what i'm trying to find the present value is 6 000 r is 10 and t is 50 months which is 50 over 12 years and i'm going to leave that as 50 over 12. so the future value equals the principal times 1 plus 0.1 times 50 over 12. i'm going to put that into the calculator now let's pull up our calculator and i like to work from the inside out and you can use your brackets to do this any way you want 50 divided by 12 is this times 10 percent add 1 equals now i'm going to multiply that by 6 000 and i end up with 8 500 i don't have the interest here it's easy to tell that the interest is going to be future value minus principal which is eighty five hundred dollars minus six thousand dollars is twenty five hundred but it's good to know we don't need that intermediate value okay let's do another one like this on december 31st you were paid a loan to the hammerhead finance and loan company you repaid six thousand dollars which was principal and interest on a fiveyear loan at 10 simple how much money did you borrow well in this case i don't know i or p i need to use this future value one p equals f v divided by one plus r t so let's write that down p f b r and t principles what i'm trying to find the future value is six thousand dollars because that was principal plus interest the interest rate is ten percent and the time was five years putting that into our equation here i get p equals six thousand dollars divided by one plus zero point one times five this time i'm going to simplify the denominator i think that ends up being easier to put into a calculator well point one times five is point five so i end up with six thousand divided by one point five well that is exactly four thousand dollars so that's how much we borrowed i'm going to do a little calculator note here 1 plus 0.10 times 5 with our brackets the way they should be multiplication before addition is 1 plus 0.5 is 1.5 if i do this wrong one plus 0.1 addition first and then multiply it by 5. that's chain mode i end up with 1.1 times 5 which is 5.5 this is wrong this is not the way we should be doing things so pay attention to the algebra and how you put things in the calculator it's okay to use extra steps hi and welcome to lesson 8 compound interest let's start by remembering simple interest when we talk about simple interest we are only sorry i'm going to race we only earn interest on the principal so only on the principle do we earn interest with compound interest it's different what's happening with compound interest is every time we get interest we add that back to the principal and we earn interest on it let's look at what these look like as a graph okay simple interest looks like a line so i'm just going to uh do this there we go so this is simple interest and what we're looking at here is the future value and over here we've got time the more time we spend the more money we get compound interest is a little bit different instead of being a straight line it's going to end up looking like an exponential curve i have to draw it in this way there we go exponential versus linear exponential grows really really fast over the long term well simple interest a linear curve stays the same that's the difference between it so what we're going to do is look at a very simple example so let's invest a thousand dollars at 25 simple one note you're going to see throughout these lectures and throughout this entire course i often use really big interest rates no bank out there is paying 25 simple but big interest rates make the math and the arithmetic easier to see and that's why we use it not because there's an investment that actually gets 25 simple so let's do that for a year in that case our future value is going to be principal times 1 plus rt our principal was a thousand dollars one plus 0.25 times one once i dump that into a calculator i get two hundred and fifty dollars okay let's reinvest so we're gonna take that money and we're going to put it in for another year now our future value is going to be 1250 times 1.25 that's the same as up here and that gives me one thousand five hundred sixty two dollars and fifty cents okay what about simple for two years so if i just did this for two years instead of taking that money out and then reinvesting i would end up with a thousand dollars one plus point two five times two is fifteen hundred dollars so in this case i've got sixty two extra dollars we have an extra 62 dollars because we took the money out and reinvested and otherwise we got interest on the interest and our interest to remember after the first year was 250 so if i look at that 250 dollars times one uh yeah let's go sorry 0.25 and times one that ends up being sixty two dollars and fifty cents so what i've ended up with is exactly the interest on the interest scrolling down that leads us to a formula so after many years when i'm compounding this way every year i'm taking it out and i'm reinvesting after one year i have a thousand times 1.25 two years three years well let's multiply it by 1.25 again and i do that a bunch of times so after n years where n is a big number or any number future value equals one thousand 1.25 to the power of n i'm multiplying this together n times that's an exponent so now i have an exponential equation let's look more about how often we compound how often do we compound in that example we compounded annually and that means once a year so something like a gic will be annual interest semiannually that means twice a year that is going to be what we're going to see later on the course is mortgages in canada are compounded sempi annually quarterly quarterly is something that you haven't probably seen a lot but what is used a lot in business that means four times per year or every three months which is confusing three months and a quarter because three times four equals 12 months in a year quarterly is how businesses file their reports and do their financial statements monthly this is probably i'm not what you've seen the most and i'm just going to write that 12 times per year and this is something like your credit card or your bank account this is one of the most common monthly and then we have weekly this isn't really used very much but it's nice to know i'm actually going to put biweekly because we're going to see that in mortgages that's 26 times per year or every two weeks and a lot of you if you are working will be paid biweekly or every two weeks in which case you need to know that i'm going to add in daily that's every day some bank accounts work that way et cetera i could compound a thousand times a year we don't do that very often but it's possible okay we compound and compounding means to compute interest add it to the principle okay so we compute it and we add it to the principal how many times per year i'm going to come up with m times per year i'm also going to write this actually i'm not going to say p let's say c y on the calculator and we're going to see this later on but the calculator uses that i'm going to write in some m's i'm going to scroll up here and i'm going to write m equals 1 m equals 2 m equals 4 for quarterly's m equals 12 for monthly m equals 52 m equals 26 biweekly and m equals 365 because i'm ignoring leap year that's probably all the ones you will see okay let's do some terminology nominal that's the english word for in name only and we call that j with a little m subscript and i'm just going to write in name only because we don't use it to compute so let's look at an example of nominal so my bank pays a very large j12 a nominal rate of 24 that means it's a monthly rate so the interest is paid into my bank account once per month this actually means how much per month two percent 24 over 12 is two percent per month so nominal is not what were you going to use in our computations 24 isn't going to go into our math 2 is and this is called the periodic rate i'm going to rewrite that that's .02 and that's called the periodic rate and that's the rate per period over that time this is a formula it's fairly easy to remember but when in doubt look something up so nominal is j m then the periodic is i and we call it i equals j m divided by m so if our nominal was j 12 equals 24 then i equals 24 over 12 equals two percent i think we have most everything we need now to be able to share the formula for compound interest and this is the important one you'll probably end up memorizing it but you can always look at it on tests and this is going to be fv equals pv 1 plus i to the power of n explain what these things mean fb we've seen that that's called future value when we talk about compound interest we use pv to be the opposite of future value is present value what we have now and that's the same as p for principle they're the same thing i is the periodic rate so that would be j m over m if we have that and n is the number of periods so the number of months or weeks depending on how we're compounding it okay let's start with question number one we're going to invest 100 for one year with a nominal rate of 24 and now we're going to look at a whole bunch of different kinds of compounding so starting with m m is how many times per year we compound for annually this is one for semiannually this is two what i would like you to do is keep on pausing this video and fill things out so fill out quarterly and monthly now okay hopefully you paused and came up with four quarters per year or 12 months per year now i'm going to write in the nominal rate annual means j1 equals 24 semiannual j2 equals 24 pause hopefully you have written in j4 equals 24 and j12 equals 24 for the periodic rate what we do is we divide it so remember i'm going to write up here i equals j m over m so if m is 1 we're just dividing by 1. that makes this really easy semiannual we're going to divide it by 2 so 24 divided by 2 is 12 percent you guys try it pause hopefully you have i equals six percent that's 24 over four and i equals two percent or 24 divided by 12. how many periods are in a year well how many years are in a year that's actually fairly easy one how many years how sorry how many half years are in a year that's going to be two how many quarters in a year four quarters in a year and 12 months in a year so now we're going to do our future value computations i'm going to write over here fv is 100 one plus .24 to the power of one because it's one year that gives me 124 dollars for semiannual well i take that hundred dollars and it's one plus i that's 1.12 but it's happening twice when i compound it twice i get 125. and 45.44 your turn well hopefully you paused it and came up with fb is 100 1.06 to the power of 4 which is 126 dollars and 25 cents and finally 126.82 cents which is the same as 100 1.02 to the power of 12. look at these one thing you should notice is that the future value is increasing the more you compound the bigger it gets if you want to know the limit the absolute biggest it can be we'll talk about that a little bit later but you can use your calculator to compute that fairly nicely so the more we compound the more money we get up to a certain point compounding makes a huge difference in our equation over here we use i not that nominal rate we only use the 24 when we're talking about annual okay let's start with question two you have five thousand dollars and you deposit the money in a mutual fund that has an average return of nine percent compounded annually how much will you have when you retire in 25 years okay so let's look at all the elements of our equation i'm going to rewrite the compound interest equation future value equals present value 1 plus i to the power of m future value is the thing we're trying to find present value here that's 5 000 dollars average return of nine percent that's going to be one because it says annual that annual means it's j1 equals nine percent or 0.09 that means that i is going to be 9 divided by 1 which is just 0.09 that's the good thing about annual and why people use them let's change colors so we can see it a little better n is going to be 25 years here n is counting years because it's the same as annual those things go together if it was a monthly we would talk about months so our future value actually let's write this at the bottom we end up with future value equals five thousand one plus nine percent which is 1.09 to the power of 25. i'm just going to show this on the calculator because sometimes it can get difficult 5000 times 1.09 to the power of that's this y to the power of x and then i write 25 and i should get 43 000 it's a big number if you're getting the wrong answer and i'd like you to try this it's a good chance that your settings are wrong so go back to week zero look at the video on how to do your settings and make sure that it's on aos mode not chn just to check what if i had done simple interest i would have started with five thousand dollars and i would have added one plus nine percent times 25 years dumping that into a calculator i would have had sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty dollars what would you prefer forty three thousand sixteen thousand this is definitely better to practice this i'm gonna give you a nice little bonus we do with your age so that's 65 or whatever retirement date you want minus your age and i'm gonna say let's use j1 equals six percent that's a more conservative estimate of how you can do in the market over the long term okay let's do another one you deposit ten thousand dollars at j4 equals twelve percent for 54 months how much money will you have let's go back to finding all of our items our present value what we start with is 10 000 j4 that's a quarterly nominal rate is 12 or 0.12 that means that i equals 0.12 divided by 4. or three percent that's what we're going to use in our calculation n n is 54 months but we don't want it to be monthly we want it to be quarterly so we're going to use a unit conversion just like we did in chapter one to change it from months into quarters and i'm going to do this the long way once you're more comfortable with it you can do this quickly you can sometimes do it in your head but i'm going to go very slowly i'm going to note that one year is equal to 12 months now i cross off my months i'm also going to note that one year and i put that on the bottom right because i want to cancel things off is equal to four quarters so what i have here is 54 times 4 divided by 12 quarters or 18 quarters i'm going to write this one more time you might look at me and say hey but you already told me that there are three months and a quarter that's right 54 divided by 3 is 18 quarters either way one of the strange things is that quarters seem to be hard it's hard to remember it's three months your brain thinks quarter four it should be four months that's incorrect okay back to our equation future value is present value one plus i to the power of n present value is ten thousand dollars uh i was three percent n is eighteen quarters and that gives us seventeen thousand twenty four dollars and thirty three cents that's how much money i have how much interest did i make can use the same thing we did before interest is the difference between how much money we have and how much money we started with in other words i have seventeen thousand dollars and some change i started with ten thousand dollars so now i must have made seven thousand and twenty four dollars and thirty three cents in interest question four you would like to save twenty thousand dollars so you can take a year off in 42 months how much should you deposit today if money earns four percent compounded semiannually okay let's note that we have the same formula we start every single example with this time we're trying to solve for present value not future value so i'm going to divide both sides by 1 plus i to the n and come up with this formula present value equals future value over 1 plus i to the n that's important it's a formula that you are going to see many times we'll go put a box around it let's look at what we have in this problem we're trying to find a future value of twenty thousand dollars we have a semiannual interest rate of four percent which means that i is going to be 0.04 over two or two percent n is 42 months and i want to get that into half years most people can remember quite easily that one half year is exactly six months so in the end we end up with seven half years going back to this equation our present value equation pv equals twenty thousand dollars divided by 1.02 to the power of seven put that in i'm going to go with 1.02 to the power of seven solve for that and use that one over x button multiply it by twenty thousand dollars and i end up with one thousand sorry seventeen thousand four hundred eleven dollars and twenty cents one more question how much money do you need to invest to earn a thousand dollars in interest in 18 months if the interest rate is eight percent compounded quarterly this is going to be a weird one because we don't know the present value or the future value instead all we know is the difference between those things is a thousand dollars that's why this is a tricky question uh quarterly n is 18 months and i'm going to go ahead and say that six quarters but if you need some help getting from months to quarters go back and watch the other videos and do a proper unit conversion i'm going to use a few of these equations future value equals present value plus interest and present value equals future value over 1 plus i to the n putting those together i end up with present value equals future value still don't know what that is uh what was my interest rate eight percent well let's just remember that it's eight percent quarterly so it's two percent as our periodic rate and this is going in for six quarters okay put this together and i know what fb is so what i'm going to do is substitute this into that i'm going to write that again pv equals pv plus i and i is a thousand dollars divided by 1.02 to the sixth this looks confusing but we can solve this with algebra with algebra i know i'm gonna multiply both sides by 1.02 to the sixth and i could work out what that is but i've decided to leave it for the moment and i get 1.02 to the power of 6 times present value equals present value plus one thousand well that's easier for me to handle moving this around i end up with 1.02 to the power of 6 minus one times the present value equals a thousand dollars well mul divide both sides and then dump that into a calculator and we get 7926.29 i'm just going to show you over here on the calculator i'm going to go with 1.02 to the power of six minus one equals a big thing i'm gonna store that store one clear and you can notice when i press recall one there it is so now i'm gonna say a thousand that is ten thousand let's do one i hope you were having better luck with your real calculators as opposed to the silly emulator recall one and we get the same thing i have over there ba two plus calculator time it's time to learn about tvm time value money and you'll see that on your calculator and if you look at the instruction manual that came with it you'll see all the things that i'm doing we're going to illustrate this with a an example as usual and you're going to see this chart written again and again and again typed out hand written all over the place i'm going to be writing the same thing every single time so mclean's magazine estimates that it will cost 130 000 for a fouryear university education when children born this year reach university in 18 years you have ten thousand dollars to invest today what annual rate is required to reach 130 000 i'm going to write this in as an equation we know our present value future value equation is future value is present value 1 plus i to the power of n the future value i want here is and thirty thousand dollars that equals present value sorry we know what that present value is it's ten thousand dollars one plus i and i don't know what i is to the power of 18. that's a difficult equation because i'm going to have to take an 18th root which i can do with the calculator however it's easier to use the tvm functions on your calculator and that is this line over here n i y p v p m t f v and i'm going to c n i y p v p m t f v i'm going to enter it in in the order that i like to put it in the calculator n is the number of periods n i y p y c y talk about that in a second pv pmt fv n is 18. so what i'm going to do is write this underneath 18. iy that's what i'm going to try to find cpt if you remember means compute pycy that just means m so m here is how many times per year and i'm looking for an annual rate that means that my pyc way is y is one i'm going to show you how to enter that in a second present value i started with ten thousand dollars payment we're going to talk about this later on in chapter five we'll talk about annuities and then i'm going to explain what it is the important thing is to put zero in for future value i'm going to put in 130 000. to make it balanced correctly and not get an error we want a present value and future value needs to be negative i'm just going to make that negative and we're going to talk about that a little bit more later let's put this in to the calculator the way you do this is you type 18 first then you press n i y will leave p y c y that's above the interest rate so i go second interest rate and it says p y equals one one enter if you want you can scroll down and see that py and cy are both there we'll explain the difference later but they're both one present value is ten thousand dollars let's go enter not enter sorry present value payment is zero so i press zero payment and i'm trying to get 130 thousand dollars and again i said i had to make that negative so now i say compute i y and i come up with iy which is the nominal rate is 15.31498 percent let's see what happens if i put 130 000 positive into my future value now when i compute i y i get an error so you know that you made a mistake if i want to check out what's in there i press recall and then the number now i can say oh i wanted that to be negative and now it is in correctly okay part b how much do you need to invest if you can only expect a rate of return of j two equals 12 percent so i'm going to write everything again well and i'm going to fill in the things i know from before how much do i need to invest that means i'm computing the present value and my future value still needs to be that hundred and thirty thousand dollars payment is zero for this chapter pycy however is now two to show that it's a semiannual rate iy this is important we put the nominal in there we're putting our nominal rate in for iy because the calculator knows to divide it by 2 to come up with 0.06 we also put this in in percent not in decimal so it's 12 and not 0.12 and well it's going to be 18 years times twice a year that's 36. important to note so let's put those things in i type 36 n 12 i y i go second i y and now i set make two enter scroll down a couple times and it's two i'm pressing clear a few times to get rid of that now pv i'm going to leave that alone payment still zero future value i'm going to say recall future value it's the same so i don't need to reenter it if you're doing the same problem clearing everything i go compute present value and i come up with 15956.30 and i could have done this with a formula pretty simply that would have been fv over 1.06 because that's i to the power of 36. you can confirm that that is the same thing but the calculator is easier and faster final part you deposit twelve thousand dollars and invest in bonds that pay six percent compounded semiannually how old will your child be when they can start university what we're trying to do here is solve for n so let's write down all of the items that we're looking for p y c y present value payment future value i like to change colors but truly it doesn't matter note that i'm computing n six percent computed semiannually present value is now twelve thousand dollars payment is still zero and my future value remains 130 thousand dollars so let's put that in six i y second pres p y cy is the same because i haven't changed yet twelve thousand dollars is now what i started with and i'll press recall future value is still negative 130. let's compute n well it says n equals 80.606 and that's in half years so to get that back into years i'm going to have to divide by 2. that is about 40.3 years so not really ideal let's play around a little bit i'm going to go back to my future value 130 000 and make it positive instead of negative now let's compute n error five good thing to know your errors when you get an error five it's probably a sign error you can also get an error too and you might end up with a negative n we'll see that later on if you get a negative n you also made a mistake and you know to fix your mistake i'm just going to know what the formula for this is if i was trying to solve this it would be 12 000 1.03 to the power of n equals 130 000 to solve this i'm going to need to use logarithms so if you remember your logarithms really well go ahead and do that i'm going to stick with using my ba ii plus calculator today we're going to talk about equivalent effective and average rates first i'm going to define one term because we're going to see this a lot effective rate just means an annual rate and we already know that means that it is j with an underscore of one or compounded annually so when we use that word that's all we mean is an annual rate comp pounded sorry let's put it once a year equivalent rate is our other term an equivalent really means that things are the same and i'm going to put that in quotes mathematically equivalent and we often use some curly brackets to mean equivalent that means things that are the same in the way that we care about sometimes you will see as well because the curly can be approximate three lines instead of two but it means the same in the way we care about in terms of interest rates the thing we care about the most is how much money we get out of them we don't care how often the bank compounds we care that they give the same future value let's say we put a hundred dollars in each one and after a year we have the same future value that means they're equivalent because as long as we care as far as we are concerned we don't care how often the bank is doing accounting we care that we get the same amount of money and we usually measure after a year because that means that whether it's monthly biweekly daily we're going to get the same result let's jump right into a problem the humongous bank believes in offering its customers choices a banker offers you two different options for your investments the premium growth account offers interest at j2 equals 10 i'm just going to write that here so we can see better and the accelerator is an effective rate of 10.25 what should we choose well what we're going to do is invest 100 in each just like we said before and you could put any amount here i just find 100 really useful and we're going to see that most of the reason is because 100 makes the math easy so in each account so let's start i'm going to scroll down a little to j2 equals 10 that's the premium uh spell premium correctly okay so after one year we have a future value of 100 times 1.05 because 5 is half of 10 to the power of 2 because there's two half years in a year which means at the end of the day i have 110 dollars and 25 cents now let's look at the next one so that's going to be j1 equals 10.25 percent and that is called the accelerator so at the end of one year we have 100 and here because it's only compounded once a year we don't have to divide that j to get an i and we put that to the power of one which means at the end we have a hundred and ten dollars and twenty five cents so which one is better well it makes no difference whatsoever they're the same or they are equivalent so i'm going to write that in a few different ways j2 equals 10 is equivalent to j1 equals 10.25 percent j2 equals 10 percent is effectively you'll see this given a lot effectively means the same as but here we're meaning it as equivalent to the effective rate of 10.25 percent when we put the word effective in we don't need to put that one in because it is assumed you're also going to see the term apr or annual percent return we're not going to use that overly in this course but know that that means the same thing and either way we are going to get 10.25 interest per year okay let's talk about converting rates with your ba2 plus calculator this is going to be the easiest way to do converting between equivalent weights because it's already given in our calculator to do this we're going to use the iconv or interest conversion worksheet you get to that by pressing 2nd and finding interest conversion which lives over the number 2. and that stands for interest conversion so i go second then i type in interest conversion and we've got three things in here and at this point you should be getting used to entering things in your ba two plus calculator enter things compute one thing and there's three things here so if you see nom i'm gonna scroll down eff that stands for effective scroll down one more time and we get cy and that stands for the nominal rate so that's j n whatever it is the effective rate i'm going to write that in the effective rate is j1 and cy is n whatever the subscript is so let's convert from at 10.25 sorry let's do j2 equals 10 percent in that case to convert it what i'm going to do is see why let's go back to nominal it's 10 enter scroll down eff i'm going to scroll down again because i don't care about that cy so let's put num equals 10 cy equals 2 and then we type in enter and now we scroll back up to nominal effective sorry and press compute 10.25 and that's what we had everything here goes through effective so i'm going to go on a longwinded metaphor let's pretend we have our train system the train system is based in vancouver if you want to get to nanaimo you have to stop in vancouver if you want to get to prince george you're routing through vancouver this is something in the north and then we have kelowna so these are four cities in british columbia and everything is going to pass through that middle one that's the effective rate j1 so if i want to go from j2 that was 10.10 and i want to go to let's say a monthly rate over here i have to convert into effective and then i have to convert to monthly let's say i want to go from a quarterly rate to a monthly rate i'm going to have to go convert from quarterly to effective and then over to monthly so we're always going back and forth but we're always routing through that middle to practice we're going to convert a whole bunch of these things just using the calculator i'm not going to do everything on camera because that's incredibly boring in my opinion so i'm going to let you fill in some of it but let's start with j1 equals 12. so what i'm going to do that's an effective rate remember so i'm going to set eff equals 12. and i want to convert that to semiannual so that means that cy is two and now i go down to nominal and i press compute and i get 11.66 percent and that's a j2 let's do it again for quarterly we go up to cy we change to four and now we recompute the nominal and we get j4 equals 11.49 etc percent now let's do one more monthly i change that to 12 i change nominal by using my compute button and i get j 12 equals 11.3865 i'm just going to put some dot dot dots so i don't have to round fairly simple so now let's do j2 equals eight percent so i'm going to go back up and i don't have to clear this but i don't i want to so what i'm going to do is press 2nd clear and that sets everything back to the base you don't need to do it because you can overwrite but it's useful so this time i'm going to start with a nominal and that's 8. i start with a nominal rate of eight percent and i change my cy to be two because it's semiannual now i go to the effective and that's what i'm computing j1 is 8.16 now that i have the effective rate i can find the quarterly and monthly so to find quarterly i set that to be 4 and my nominal is now 7.92 one more cy is 12. nominal is 7.86 i'm just going to put some dot dot dots one thing to notice our rates are changing in size this is a smaller number because we're compounding more often which we know gives us more interest a smaller interest rate gets us the same amount of number as the bigger so in this case these two numbers are going to be bigger than 10 percent and this number is going to be smaller than 10 percent i'd like you guys to pause the video and continue to fill out the table i'm going to unpause and everything will be magically filled in see like magic it's all nicely filled in so make sure that you get the same answers as me mortgages charge interest on a semiannual basis but payments are usually made monthly change a mortgage rate of j two equals seven percent to a rate compounded monthly we're going to come back to this again when we start talking about mortgages this is one of the big differences between banking in canada and banking in the united states canadian banks compound mortgages semiannually they don't really though they actually advertise semiannual rates but compound usually using an equivalent rate every time you make a payment that's opposed as opposed to american banks that report with monthly rates that's how they advertise this wasn't always true once upon a time before computers were widespread it was actually compounded every six months so every payment you made before six months no interest was accruing they all went towards principal which was a different type of mortgage and you would end up paying for a different amount of time and paying less interest things are different now that computers make this very simple so if you pay monthly they use an equivalent monthly rate if you pay biweekly and we're going to come to this uh more when we get to mortgages but biweekly is the way a lot of people are paid and that means you're paid 26 times a year then they're going to use the equivalent j26 often people do this because it works out with your payment scheme if you are paid that way okay so what we're going to do is find at the monthly rate and again we did this in the last one j2 goes to j1 goes to j12 we're always going through that effective rate so let's start with j2 equals seven percent and i'm going to use the calculator so we go to second interest conversion our nominal rate is seven my effective rate is what i'm looking for right now i have two go back to the effective rate and it's five 7.1225 not getting rid of any of those decimal places for now now i'm going to change cy to 12 and compute the nominal rate which is around 6.9 there we go okay but let's do it a different way and i'm going to say this is a check because i started at the beginning and said if i start with a hundred dollars how much do i have at the end so i'm gonna start with a hundred dollars and i'm going to invest it at seven percent dividing seven and two gives me three and a half so i do that and i end up with 107 dollars and 12 cents let's do that with the effective rate in the middle here 100 to the 1 is when i round it 107 12. same thing and finally let's do the last one i start with a hundred dollars one point i'm going to put that entire thing in here over 12. i'm going to say 1 plus that to the power of 12. okay i'm going to use the calculator for this because i don't want to round it at all so i'm going to clear and clearing lets me save that number i'm going to divide it by 100 first to make it a percent then i'm going to divide it by 12 and i'm going to add that to one now i'm going to take that to the power of 12 and multiply it by a hundred dollars and i get the same thing 107 dollars and 12 cents or 12 and a quarter they're all the same not only are they all the same when i was did the rounding there notice that i had these this is 7.122 the amount of interest i get is the effective rate the effective rate is exactly the interest you get on a hundred dollars if you don't want to divide by a hundred do it on a dollar that will give you seven point one two two five cents but it's easy enough to see it in percent let's do one more your credit card charges interest at one and a half percent per month find the effective rate credit cards one thing to remember is unless you're told differently all credit cards are monthly this is a piece of what we call domain knowledge it's knowledge that you really should have a question will not necessarily tell you that credit cards are monthly so that's something you need to know let's find the effective rate so first i can learn per means periodic rate anytime you see that word per month you know that that's the periodic rate at or per so that's the periodic rate so i equals 0.015 that means that j 12 equals 0.015 times 12 or 18 that's a lot that's more than one and a half it looks small when you say it monthly but you do have to end up multiplying that so let's see how much we have after one year and this is the same thing that we've been doing we start with a hundred dollars and we put it at well we know that it's 015 to the power of 12. so 100 times 1.015 to the power of 12. and that is going to give me 119.56 the effective rate or j1 it's 19.56 and you can check this using the interest conversion worksheet in part two of this lesson we're going to talk about average rates the big idea on this unit is that our interest rates are not stable they change over time and this is what happens when you invest in something like the stock market or mutual funds the rate is not fixed for a 10year investment it's going up and down with the market let's say not over time but over the course of our investment in this case i don't really care what it's doing every single month i care what it's doing on average and just so you know there's lots of types of averages when i talk about an average rate of return i'm definitely not talking about taking all the numbers adding them and dividing by the number of rates or the arithmetic mean when you take statistics you'll learn more about that but here what i care about is how much i get on average so if i invested at that average rate i want the same present value giving the same future value or they are equivalent so we're looking here at equivalent rates as usual the best way to learn a concept is to actually go through an example so let's start with example number five from the lesson premium savings bonds have the following rates all annual in the first year you make two percent in the second year you make five percent in the third year twelve in the fourth year fifteen percent and by year five you're making twenty four percent per year and i'm just going to do an aside these are exaggerated rates so that we can do the arithmetic easily not because i know of an investment that pays 24 so the first thing we're gonna do is figure out how much a thousand dollar investment would be worth at the end of the fifth year and we can do this with thousand dollars a hundred dollars anything but the question says a thousand so after one year well we start with a thousand and after one year we say 1.02 to the power of one that's how much money we have after the first year let's see how much that is 1 000 times 1.02 so i've made 20 dollars in interest okay now let's look at that second year in the second year we make five percent interest so i take everything i did before i'm going to put brackets around it though that isn't necessary and i'm going to multiply that by 1.05 to the power of 1. so now i have 15 30. i think i did that wrong so i'm going to stop following along with the calculator right now and now i'm going to say 1.12 to the power of 1 so this is the second third fourth year 1.15 finally 1.24 so let's do the entire thing with the calculator thousand times 1.02 times 1.05 indeed i had made a mistake there one times 1.12 at the end of the third year we have 199 dollars in interest fourth year we have 13.79 and finally a whopping let's put a one there at 1 710 and 52 cents and i'm going to leave this whole unrounded number okay so that's how much money i have that's my future value and i'm going to write the whole unrounded number down because i'm going to use this in the next part when we use things it's best not to round them store one i like to put a one in square brackets to remind myself of where i stored that in my calculator so now let's look at the average rate the average effective rate is the rate i would need to get to that future value so it's i where let's look at this if i take a thousand dollars and i go one plus i to the power of five years equals one seven one oh and i'm gonna put in all those decimal points this is solvable all i need to do is use a fifth root or 1 to the power of point something to the power of 0.2 but i'm not going to do that i'm going to use the calculator because as we've seen that tvm button on our calculator is really really useful that's a v okay n is five years the rate is what i'm trying to do it's effective so one i start with a thousand and i end with remember this has to be negative and that's so our equation can balance correctly so let's go into that and i'm going to leave make this negative and put it straight into the future value 1000 is the present value 0 is our payment our interest rate is what we're going to find make sure pycy is 1. nice and our n is 5. in that case i worked backwards but usually i work forwards so let's compute i y and we end up with 11.33 percent so i averaged 11.33 on this investment that means that on average even though sometimes we were making two percent and sometimes 24 had we invested at point three three percent for five years we would end up with the same thing so they're effective now i'm gonna write down a bad idea i'm gonna write bad idea first so you don't get a still of this and end up with a mistake two percent five percent 12 15 24 well there's five years we divide that all by five and what do we get eleven point six percent that is not the answer it doesn't work that way at all when we're talking about average rates we're talking about a particular kind of average a single number that is equivalent we're not talking about the arithmetic mean or that type of app let's just do a little one to illustrate what's going on our investment earns a hundred percent return in the first year and loses 50 percent in the second year what is the effective rate of return over two years in this case we don't have a number so let's make something up you've probably noticed by now that when i have to make something up i start with a hundred dollars some people use one dollar some people use a thousand you could use 312 dollars and 52 cents but that seems a little difficult for me so let's start with a hundred dollars at the end of the first year our future value is now a hundred dollars and it's earned a hundred percent return so that means it's one plus one that's our markup or percent change and that means that now we have two hundred dollars at the end of year two it's lost money it's lost fifty percent this is the same as a markdown we haven't overly talked about negative interest rates but negative interest rates happen a lot especially in the stock market we lose money over time hopefully we make more money than we lose but from month to month we might lose that's a negative interest rate this is a rate of negative fifty percent when i dump that in i end up with a hundred dollars so what's my average rate present value is 100 and at the end of two years i still have a hundred dollars that means that we averaged zero percent interest so this investment was equally as good as taking your money putting it in a box and putting it under your bed in general we say that we've lost money on something with a zero percent interest because we have inflation going on where money is worth less over time in 1989 to buy a chocolate bar might have cost me about 50 cents now a chocolate bar probably costs about a dollar 75 that's a huge change over time money is worth less and when you take econ you'll learn more about that how that is going to change things finally question 7 a mutual fund had returns of 12 compounded monthly in the first year 18 compounded annually in the second year and four percent compounded quarterly in the third year what would a thousand dollar investment three years ago be worth today so we can do this in multiple ways i'm going to confess i'm a big fan of algebra so i would probably write this out algebraically well i started with a thousand then i have one plus twelve percent over twelve first year to the power of one multiplied by 1.18 because it's annual and then 1 plus 0.04 divided by 4 quarterly for the third year so that's going to be 4. sorry this is 12 because it was for 12 months that's the way i would think to do this in my head and i would get the right answer however a lot of people most people prefer to use something like a calculator so what we're going to do is look at this by using our ba2 plus calculator and also by keeping track so i'm going to add one extra column and that's the year in the first year we earn 12 percent compounded monthly i'm gonna write j twelve equals twelve percent in the second year we have eighteen percent annual and i'm writing that in and in the third year we have j4 equals 4 and sometimes these can happen for multiple years the textbook whose pdf is up on our website our learning hub class has an example where things take place over multiple years so expect to see that as well okay so the first year that's 12 months and a monthly rate our interest rate is 12 that's a lot of 12s in a row and our present value was a thousand dollars and this is what we're going to compute next in our next year whatever my future value is i'm going to move that over to present value it's annual but it's an 18 interest rate payment is always zero and i'm still going to compute finally i'm going to do this again for four quarters quarterly four and whatever i got here i'm going to put there so let's try this i start and i go 12 for n my interest rate also 12 and i'm going to make sure my pycy turns to 12 and when you change py cy changes automatically we start with a thousand dollars make sure payment is zero and at the end of the first year we have negative one one two six point eight two five and we store everything i'm gonna make this positive because i'd like my present values to be positive but you don't need to do that i'm going to press present value what i've done here is put this into the present value so now let's clear and start at the beginning n is 1 i y is now 18. pycy is back to one present value i did payment i don't have to put in zero every time but i like to and i go compute future value and now i have 13 26. and that's negative sorry 13 29 and 65 cents i like to make it positive by just pressing that plus minus button and then i'm going to press present value what i've done now is store this in my present value clear that n is now four our interest rate is also four and my pycy has gone to four enter and i clear i've done my present value and payment already so i'm just going to compute the future value and i get 1383 0.648 anytime i see this i'm going to save it so store 1 in case i need it again and you never know when you're going to need it so the answer for a is the future value is 1 383 64 cents and you can go up here and see i've done this on my own off camera and i did get the exact same answer which is nice to know part b what was the average rate compounded monthly of return earned so we're trying to find the average rate one advantage is we already have this future value here so it's monthly for three years that means we're investing this for 36 months i y is what we're going to be looking for p y c y well that's monthly and i start with what i started with at the beginning a thousand dollars and i'm going to end with my future value 1383 dollars and change so let's put that in 36 n let's go to our pycy i already actually set that to be 12. good for me start with a thousand dollars pv zero payment it's always good to recall so i'm gonna say recall future value and know what i have recall is how you check things out so let's compute i y and then we find out that j 12 equals 10.87 and change and that's our average rate so if i had taken a thousand dollars and invested it at 10.87 compounded monthly after three years i would have thirteen hundred dollars okay let's do one more part part c the fun lost a hundred dollars in its fourth year whoops the average effective rate of return for the four years so what we're going to do is look at just that fourth year i don't need to use my tvm buttons we lost a hundred dollars so we started with 13 83 and 64 cents and we lost 100 so we end up with 1283.64 here i'm going to say it doesn't matter as much if we hold on to our rounding because now we're on a specific number and it's always good to hang on to our interest hang on to all those decimal places but it's less important in this particular example so now our future value is going to be always negative our payment's always zero we started out with a thousand dollars and we invested it and this is effective so it's annual over four years and our interest rate is what we're looking for so let's start n is four iy we can leave alone pycy now changes to one our present value is still a thousand dollars but our end or future value is oh we have to clear out a py negative at the end our future value is now 1200 and change so our interest rate is going to be smaller so we end up with 6.44 percent and that's how we do average interest rates importantly i'm going to say that you should be practicing this there's questions on the online homework as well as questions in the textbook this is a good thing to practice lesson 10 payment plans and making choices let's start with a question and we're going to work through this question and learn how to make decisions using interest rates for your first job after graduation you have decided to accept a contract position the manager is offered to pay you thirty thousand dollars at the end of the first year and thirty five thousand dollars at the end of the second year or to pay you twenty two thousand dollars now twenty thousand dollars at the end of the first year and twenty thousand dollars at the end of the second year which option is better and by how much if interest is at ten percent simple use today as your focal date so let's talk about comparing two choices sorry what we do is we pick a focal date or one is given to us and in the truth it doesn't matter which one we choose the better choice is the better at any time usually or often we use today today is a good focal date because computing it is nice then what we do is we compute all values at this date and then we pick the best one and the best one is the one where either we have the most money or we pay the least money depending what it is what we're going to do to help us is draw what's called a timeline timelines are something we're going to be doing a lot of in this course so i'm going to draw two of them one of them was perfect and one of them was not and i'm gonna put in the times zero is today all the times mentioned in the problem one year two years zero one year two years and i've drawn two of these because i have two options my options are a and b okay let's put in our money i like to say that money into my account is going to be an arrow down so this money goes into my account at one year in option one i get two payments one at a year and one at two years so i get thirty thousand dollars and then i get thirty five thousand dollars two years from now seventy sorry sixty five 000 in total but not for a while in option b i'm getting 22 000 right away 20 000 in a year and another twenty thousand dollars looking at this just so you can see the total here it's sixty five thousand dollars over the two years but i get have to wait a while until i get it in this one it's 40 plus 22 is a little bit less it's 62 000 but the fact that i'm getting some of it today is good so i'm going to use some arrows to show that i'm going to move everything to the focal date circle the focal date that's today and i'm going to move this over when we move something backwards we are starting with a future value and we're ending with a present value so what i'm going to do is find the present value of each of those payments and then add them together so here i've got present value 1 is thousand dollars and it's going backwards one year at simple interest and that was ten percent interest so that's what's happening present value two is thirty five thousand dollars over one plus times one let's just pull the calculator back up uh so let's look at those together 30 000 divided by 1.1 is 27 000 ish here sorry this should be a 2 here because it was 2 years just going to highlight that 2 because it's going 2 years i'm going to store this as well and then i'm going to do my present value 2 is 35 000 divided by 1.2 and that gives me 29 166. so my present value how much this is worth is found by adding those two things up and it's 56 000 so you can use the calculator i've already worked this out ahead of time so you can believe me that it's 56 439.39 let's go on to the second example so i'm finding present values for each thing future value 1 was 22 000 future value two is twenty thousand and future value three was also twenty thousand so present value one well that's just twenty two thousand it's not moving anywhere when something stays still we don't need to worry about interest present value two is going to be that twenty thousand dollars divided by one plus ten percent times one and present value two is going to be the same size payment but it's worth a bit less because i'm multiplying that ten percent times two so my present value for this is going to be adding all those three things together and i'd like you guys to try this in your calculator and you should end up with the same answer as me that is 56848.48 so what would you choose well i don't know about you but i would choose this one let's put a sentence down there and that sentence is option b is worth more in what we call today's dollars by today's interest rate so it is a better option and part of that is big part is that upfront money getting that 22 thousand dollars today is really worth a lot now we're going to talk about a payment scheme and we're going to be doing more of this in lesson 11 but we're going to start now you have two debts coming too a debt of one thousand dollars in six months and another of fifteen hundred dollars at the end of the year interest is charged at twelve percent simple you speak to mr hammerhead the loans manager and discuss several different payment options so let's start with a how much would we have to pay to pay it off today so for this what we do is we start by drawing a timeline so timelines are the way we start a lot of these we say today zero six months and i like to put in simple how many years it is if that because that's easy to put into the calculator and one year from now okay so we owe a thousand dollars and i'm going to put this as an arrow out to show that i have to pay that money it doesn't matter how you put it but we're going to see next time that you need to when you have both incoming money and outgoing money inflows and outflows you do have to pay attention to that type of thing so we'll talk more about that in the next series of videos so we owe a thousand dollars now or in six months and fifteen hundred dollars in a year so somehow we are going to pay the whole thing off today just like we did before we're going to move everything to our focal date and that's today because it says so in the problem so we're going to pay them both so same as we did before let's make that a future value future value one is a thousand future value two is fifteen hundred so present value one is then one thousand over one plus zero point one two times zero point five and present value two is going to be fifteen hundred over one plus zero point one two times one i'm going to simplify this a little bit because it's easier if this goes into my calculator like this and over here it's easier if it goes into my calculator as 1500 over 1.12 so we're going to put that in the calculator together and i put them in at the exact same time and we come out with those two things added together which is going to be two thousand eighty not twenty two thousand sorry guys i'm reading my notes wrong it's twenty two hundred and i'm going to do that by putting that in the calculator as well one thousand divided by 1.06 plus 1500 divided by 1.12 putting that in together i get the same answer we're going to do the exact same one for part b but now we're going to pay in 18 months so we're going to do the same problem different focal date so this time let's draw in this equation i've got today six months or 0.5 years one year and now i'm going to add 1.5 years or 18 months and this isn't a scale your diagrams do not need to be perfect mine certainly are not sorry that i wanted that to go upwards we owe 1 000 at six months we owe fifteen hundred dollars in a year and what we're going to do is pay everything off here so i'm going to move everything over this time i'm moving it to one and a half years so i'm gonna have to do some counting six months to one and a half years i'm going to write this here so i remember one year to one and a half years is 0.5 years now remember this is now a present value and i'm going to be finding future values so fv1 is going to be a thousand but this time i'm moving it forwards in time i'm going to be paying more interest on this loan so it'll be 1000 times one plus zero point one two times one plus fifteen hundred with six months interest uh this is actually i'm not going to even put the one there i'm just going to say future value equals this thing i'm going to simplify it a little and i can put this in the calculator just like this 1000 times 1.12 plus 1500 times 1.06 and that is 27 10. so what would you prefer 2710 in 18 months or 2282 right away well if we wait 18 months we have to pay more interest that's what is happening here the interest is a lot more so if i had the money i'd choose today if i don't have the money then i'm going to choose 18 months because i don't have 2 200 to pay right now let's do another one where we're making choices this time however instead of using simple interest we're now using compound interest however nothing changes just the interest formula everything else is the same so sagir received two offers for property is selling offer one consists of seven hundred thousand dollars immediately and offer two consists of five hundred thousand dollars now and one hundred and ten thousand dollars per year at the end of the next two years money earned six percent compounded semiannually which one is better and how much economic advantage just means which one is better for us economically and that's always how we're saying and by how much that's going to be the difference between the offers so let's write in the offer offer one today and we have one year and two years and for our next offer we've got today one year two years offer one is seven hundred thousand dollars now so i write in seven hundred thousand dollars and an arrow going in to my account and that's it that's actually easy to figure out the present value of offer one i'm putting a one there to mean offer one is just that seven hundred thousand dollars that's how much it's worth offer two is a lot more interesting it's going to be only 500 000 now but there's extra money added we also get 110 000 a year for two years so we get some extra payments an extra twenty thousand dollars in total versus offer one but we have to wait for a while one thing that i like to do when i draw these timelines is write my interest rate right in just so i remember what's going on there so offer one we've gotten that we don't need to do any interest but for offer two it says in today's dollars and that means that focal date is today and that is often the way we do these choices it makes sense to use today's money okay so what we end up with is our present value is going to be well five hundred thousand dollars today is worth five hundred thousand dollars today a hundred and ten thousand dollars in a year is going to be worth 110 000 plus 1.03 and it's one year i'm gonna say that's two half years so to the power of two and my last payment well that's going to be over 1.03 to the power of four put that into the calculator and we will see our answer i'm going to actually do this entire thing feel free to stop the video if you want to just know i'll give you the answer 701 419.13 in the calculator 500 000 plus oops i'm not doing this correctly 500 000 plus 1 one zero one two three divided by 1.03 squared equals plus 110 one two three might have been better now that i look at this for me to store all these numbers so forget me putting it in i can't work the tiny little calculator today it's 701 i did it on a real calculator so this one is better it's a better one or it has a more economic advantage and it's better by exactly one thousand four hundred nineteen dollars and thirteen cents in today's dollars because the present value is worth exactly one thousand four hundred nineteen dollars and thirteen cents more anna poured thousand dollars from a local loan shark on january the first twenty ten at j 12 equals 24 on january 1st 2012 anna paid the loan shark 500 and the loan shark agreed to lower the rate to j12 equals 18 percent how much money will anna owe as of january 1st 2014 and if anna pays the balance how much interest will she have paid so let's go over this question in a little bit of detail we have more complicated things going on than the others because our interest rate is changing this is going to take some more careful planning so i'm going to write january 1st 2010 everything is january 1st so that's okay 2012. let's just extend this and we're going to 2014 and i could say that zero years one year two year three year four year if that's what i would like okay so anna borrowed one thousand dollars so she borrowed it i like to say that it goes into her account and then in 2012 she paid back 500 so we're gonna do this by checking the balance but we're also going to see next time that we could do this as what's called an equation of value so we're going to see this in a couple different ways let's look at january 1st 2014. actually before i do that let's look at the most important thing that's going on here and making it crazy the interest rate changes so in the beginning we have j 12 equals 24 otherwise known as i is 2 that's 24 over 12. in the second half the interest rate changes to only 18 dividing that by 12 it's one and a half percent so things are changing so let's see what happens if we go through her balance on january 1st 2010 anna owes one thousand dollars in 2011 she now owes a thousand dollars plus interest that interest well it's going two years into the future 2 times 12 is 24 months in which case she now owes a thousand times 1.02 to the power of twentyfour so she was sixteen hundred dollars i'm gonna write what she owes but she pays five hundred dollars so she owes less okay so she only owes 11.08 but now it's going to accrue some interest sorry this not 2011 it is 2012 because that's what's happening here in 2014 she now owes 1108 plus another two years of interest but this time she's only being charged one and a half percent per month so this and i'm going to leave it unrounded though that is one of those things that i'm going to have to talk about in a different lecture the truth is some people keep track of all those decimal places and some people don't and in this class i'm going to let you do either 0.015 to the power of 24 equals 15 8 4 51. here we go so that's how much money anna owes on the 14th if she pays it off how much interest should she have paid interest is going to be money paid minus money borrowed and we're going to see this in lots of different ways money in money out money paid money borrowed so anna paid looks like she made a payment of a thousand dollars and she made that payment of 1584.51 sorry she didn't pay a thousand dollars she paid 500 correct but she borrowed a thousand dollars in total which means in the end she paid 1084.51 cents in interest lesson 11 equations of a value we've talked a lot about interest rates compound and simple interest this time we're going to balance everything into an equation an equation of value is a fancy way of saying that we need to balance our account so that means that all of the inflows is the same as all of the outflows when we count for interest in other words all the money in equals all the money out or in other words money borrowed equals money paid those things balance as soon as we add in interest when we do an equation of value we're going to look through a story about either borrowing money or lending out money and we're going to move everything to the same time and then we're going to solve this equation so i'm going to tell you what the basic tools are the first thing we're going to do is draw a timeline those timelines really really help it's hard to do it without we're going to circle the focal date here's a rule simple interest you must be told because the answer is going to be different depending on what you choose as a focal date for compound interest choose the easiest one and we'll talk about what makes it easiest the one that the algebra would be easy is for put in all the monies paying attention to the direction and that really means did i borrow the money did the money go into my bank account or did i pay it back and i lost the money then we're going to set up equation and we're going to find a bunch of pvs and feves in general if we're moving forward in time we find the future value and we multiply if we are moving backwards in time we're finding a present value and we divide it's the same as it was in our partial payments back in chapter one next we're going to solve the equation and next then we're going to state the answer example one today you take out a five thousand dollar loan at ten percent simple interest which is to be repaid with two equal payments at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year find the size of the payments using today as your focal date so let's put in some of our items ten percent simple these questions could deal with simple or compound interest and it's important for us to know which one five thousand dollar loan and then two equal payments so let's start with a timeline there we go nice and neat let's put in our times today is always zero one year and two years so those are the times that are important we borrowed five thousand dollars and we're going to repay x dollars and that's because i have to choose any kind of variable and i choose the letter x that's often what we do it says use today is your focal date so i'm going to go ahead and circle that importantly i have to say whether everything is money in or money out that five thousand dollars is a loan it came into my account well those payments are leaving my account it doesn't matter which way you decide to draw your arrows as long as you're consistent after all five thousand dollars coming into my account means the person who loaned me the money had five thousand dollars leave their account and the payments will come to them as income every question has both people and it can be done either way let's move everything to the focal date and then we set this up so x is the size of the payment and we're going to set this up as money in equals money out or money paid sorry money borrowed equals money paid so let's start with that money that we borrowed we borrowed five thousand dollars and the five thousand dollars isn't moving at all so it gets to stand alone exactly where it is that's going to be equal to this first payment of x that's moving backwards and we know that then we're dividing we're finding a present value and that is x over one plus ten percent simple times one and then we're going to take the present value of this guy again we're moving backwards so that second payment of x is one plus ten percent times two when we come up with something like this it makes a lot of sense to uh simplify before we start to do anything if you love algebra and this is really something you're good at pause now do the albert algebra to solve for x if you're struggling keep on watching okay i'm going to make this a little bit simpler now i have two different fractions on the bottom i'm actually going to move this over a little bit and you will see why i have two denominators so what i'm going to do is multiply both sides by 1.1 and 1.2 and because there's a plus in here i'm gonna multiply everything let's just move this over here 1.1 1.2 perfect now i can do some simplifying there's a 1.1 on the bottom and the top and there's a 1.2 on the top and the bottom this is a good way of clearing out those denominators i'm going to rewrite this expression without doing any arithmetic well that looks a lot nicer next i'm going to actually move those sides over because i personally always like my x to be on the left and the other number to be on the right stew five thousand dollars times one point one times one point two and i get six thousand six hundred dollars when i add these together because remember i'm distributing this through so 1.1 plus 1.2 is 2.3 so i have 2.3 x equals 6 600. i'm going to go ahead and divide both sides by 2.3 and that will clear that 2.3 from the x and what i'm left with is just x over equals six thousand six hundred over two point three six thousand six hundred showing up on my calculator divided by two point three and i get twenty two thousand 869.57 remembering to round up and that is the answer and i'm going to finish by writing a sentence each payment is going to be 2869.57 let's do one more part it's not written in this question but we care about interest in general this is really important we do want to know how much we paid in this case interest is going to be money paid minus money borrowed with no interest calculated and i'm going to say no pv or fv so the money i paid is going to be two payments of 2869.57 and we borrowed five thousand dollars i'm going to clear this because i don't want all those trailing decimal places one of the frustrating things about business math is even though we always end up with fractions of a cent and we carry them through you can't make a payment that's less than a cent so you always have to round when you make a payment so multiply that by two and subtract five thousand and it looks like i paid 739.14 in interest that's how much this loan cost question two today you take out a five thousand dollar loan at ten percent compounded quarterly which is to be repaid with two equal payments at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year a find the size of the payments and b how much interest will be paid if this question looks familiar it should it's the exact same question that we did in question one except that now we have i'm just going to circle two equal payments now instead of having simple interest we have compound interest as before i'm going to start by drawing in my timeline today one year two years but everything here is quarterly so i'm going to say j4 equals 10 which means that i is 10 divided by 4 or 2 and a half percent in case you're wondering how i did that ten percent is point one and i divided that by four so let's use today as our focal date just because that's what we did last time here though we get a lot more leeway in compound interest no matter where you choose your focal date you're going to come up with the exact same answer that means that we could choose something where the equation looks nice in algebra but what we're going to do today is just do the same thing we did before except now we're using the compound interest formula i'm going to state what x is so x is the size of each payment and i'm going to put a note any focal date will do in compound interest this isn't true and simple simple interest is not as elegant and it does matter where we choose the focal date so the two people that are arranged in the in the lending sorry have to choose one together so let's put our money borrowed equals money paid or money in money out our money borrowed was five thousand dollars and our money paid was that first payment of x but it's going back in time one year or four quarters if you're not sure about these payments these measurements go ahead and put those quarters in so this is one quarter two quarters three quarters etc that helps now let's add that second payment also 1.025 but this time it's going eight quarters into the past let's calculate this there are lots and lots of ways to calculate this but i'm going to do just one way what i'm going to do is actually i'm going to move everything over to the other side i'm going to note that x over 1.025 to the 4 is kind of like this fraction times x and now i'm going to use the calculator scroll up a little 1 divided by 1.025 to the power of 4. that's a big long number so i'm going to store it i press store and then 1. and that is 0.9059.x anytime i store something i like to write down what i stored it as so i can get it back let's do the next part 1.02 to the power of 8 and then it was 1 over that so 0.82 and i'm going to store that as 2. and again let's write down that that was stored as two and that whole thing equals five thousand dollars now i can factor out that x so this thing here well that's going to be recall 1 plus we call 2 and it's 1.72666 another big number every time i get to these big messy numbers i like to store them store three so now i have let's scroll up a little 1.72669 x and that's the same as store three and that equals five thousand dollars and now we're back to a similar place where we were i can divide both sides by that so now i have x equals this guy so i have 1.72669 i'm going to clear 5 000 divided by recall 3 is this 2895.70 it's different than we had before and i'm going to end this with a sentence each payment is 2895 and 70 cents interest is the same way so we paid well money paid minus money borrowed in interest same thing here only we have a different payment we borrowed five thousand dollars so i'm going to clear this just so that i don't have to worry about those trailing decimal places though if you use the decimal places it's not the end of the world okay we paid 791.40 in interest that's not dramatically different than before but if i'm going to scroll up to question 1 we paid 7.39 so that's a lot more in general that's going to be true the longer a time period we invest for the less we're going to pay in interest charges with simple and the more interest in compound if we're investing the money compound is going to be better in the long term because we end up with more money question three you must repay a debt of six thousand dollars at six percent simple borrowed today the finance company has agreed to allow you to make three yearly payments with the first payment in one year the first two payments will be equal and the third payment will be five hundred dollars more than the first two payments find the size of the payments using three years from now as your focal date first this is a simple interest question which means it's important that we note the focal date because we don't really have a lot of choice let's draw a line in okay our timeline goes from now or zero one year two years three years the focal date is at three years i'm gonna circle that and i'm gonna put everything there we borrowed six thousand dollars i like to show that as six thousand dollars going into your account and we repaid it in three payments at one year two years and three years everything here is going to be ten sorry ten percent six percent simple let's let x be the first payment then we have x here and the second payment is the same and the third payment is five hundred dollars more than the first one so it's x plus five hundred dollars when we have a choice if there's anything with an addition there it is easiest to put it at the focal date so if we could have chosen a focal date i would have chosen this one this time everything is moving forward so we're going to be finding future values for all of our items so we have again money borrowed equals money paid once we account for interest so we borrowed six thousand dollars but we're moving that forward in time six percent three years times six percent because it's going three years into the future that's going to be the same as this x is moving two years into the future and this x is moving one year into the future and finally our last payment is staying the same i'm going to put that in brackets just so we know it all sorts together i'm going to simplify this a little and then like i often do i'm going to move all the x's to the same side so here once i simplify this i have 1.18 times 6 000 equals 1.12 x plus yeah 1.12 x plus 1.06 x plus x plus 500. moving all the x's together 1.12 x plus 1.06 x plus x equals 1.18 times 6 000 and i'm going to do that in a second and then i have this minus 500 because it really switched sides there adding these things together 1.12 plus 1.06 plus 1. and remember when it's just x it's the same as 1x this is 3.18 x equals 1.18 times 6 000 plus sorry minus 500 is 6580 okay i am going to divide both sides switch colors because we might as well by 3.18 and we end up with x equals 6 5 8 0 is showing up divided by 3.18 is going to be two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents and this is the first payment but if i scroll just a little to look at our timeline we had three payments the second payment was also x and the third payment was x plus 500 so it's going to be 2569.18 those are the payments now let's look at the interest money paid minus money borrowed well we paid one payment of two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents another payment of two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents a payment of two five six nine point one eight and we borrowed and put that all in a bracket six thousand dollars which means once we dump that into a calculator which i'm not going to do on screen we end up with 707 dollars and 54 cents that's the interest i'm gonna note that sometimes we call this the cost of borrowing this was how much the loan cost us over the three years we paid 707.50 in interest question four is the trickiest one of this whole bunch because now we're going to have multiple inflows as well as multiple outflows you borrowed thousand three thousand dollars from your line of credit eight months ago and a further five thousand dollars three months ago you arranged with the bank to pay off the line of credit with two payments the first payment six months from today will be twice as large as the second payment made one year from today the bank charges you nine percent interest compounded monthly suggested focal date six months from today find the size of each payment and then find out how much interest you paid i'm going to say it is a suggested focal date because with compound interest it actually doesn't matter we can choose whichever one we want so i'm going to draw in a timeline and start by putting in some months i usually like to put today right at the beginning and now i'm gonna highlight every date we have eight months ago three months ago six months from today one year from today those are all the points we have a go means in the past so i would put this down as minus eight months and we also have minus three months don't worry about it being to scale this timeline is meant to help me not to be super accurate six months 12 months okay we do know that the bank is going to charge us nine percent compounded monthly i'm just going to write that over here j 12 equals 9 which means i is going to be 0.09 over 12 is 0.0075 and this is a compound interest problem let's let x be one of the payment let's let it be the second payment and i've chosen that you could choose any one you want because the first one is twice as large as the second so that way it makes sense to have x to be the second payment so let's put in the money we borrowed we borrowed three thousand dollars eight months ago again that's going into our account and we borrowed more money an extra five thousand dollars three months ago we arranged to pay off the bank line with two payments and those are at six months from today i'm actually going to change the color there so we can see that it's a different side and one at 12 months from today we said this was the second payment x which means that 2x is the first payment suggested focal date is six months from today but it could be anything today doesn't make sense because there's no payment happening today so i'm going to stick with that six months but with compound interest it's actually your choice now i'm going to move everything backwards remembering we divide when we go backwards we multiply when we go forwards money borrowed equals money paid so let's start with the money that we borrowed i'm gonna scroll up a little so we've got some extra space we borrowed three thousand dollars and actually let's take a moment before we really get started and write in those times eight months ago to six months from today is eight plus six is fourteen months three months ago to six months from today is six plus three is nine months six months to this that's zero and 12 months from today six months from today that's six months sometimes it helps to have those n values written in already so we've got three thousand dollars is moving 14 months into the future that five thousand dollars is moving nine months into the future now that 2x it isn't doing anything but the x is moving backwards and it's moving six months into the past there's lots of ways to solve this equation i'm going to just do one way and i'm going to use the calculator heavily so first i'm going to rewrite this by moving the x's to the left side and i'm going to note that this is 2 plus 1 over 1.0075 to the power of 6. and then i have this whole mess and i'm going to put that in the calculator in a minute there's lots of clever algebra you could do by using rules of exponents but i'm not going to do that in this class but if that seems like something that you can do go ahead first let's calculate this guy so that is i'm going to go backwards 1.0075 to the power of 6. and then i'm going to take 1 over that and add 2. and just like before i'm going to save this store 1. so this is 2.95615 x and i'm going to print store one there that equals i'm going to put the entire second side in the calculator 3 000 times 1.0075 to the power of 14 plus 5 000 times 1.008 to the power of 9. i get 8678.63 i'm going to store that though in the next line once we divide out by this guy over here i'm going to have this number 8600 ish divided by whatever i stored under one and i get 2 935 dollars now at any time if you're having trouble making this algebra work this is a good reason to come talk to me or do some of the algebra work provided online talking to me is always going to help that is the second payment so let's do the first one as well that's 2x well i'm going to clear it because i don't want to worry about those decimal places but it is not overly concerning 5871.56 is the first payment now let's do the interest so again money paid minus money borrowed so we paid in this side 29 35.78 and we paid 5871.56 i'm gonna put that in brackets the money we borrowed was those two payments together and i'm putting those in brackets to show that we're gonna add those first three thousand and five thousand so we borrowed eight thousand dollars running that through a calculator we come up with 807.34 and again we call that the cost of borrowing today we're going to start talking about annuities the key to annuities is that we're taking a compound interest problem and we're adding a payment what is an annuity i'm going to write out this definition and then read it out loud an annuity is a sequence of payments at regular intervals for set time and to make it easier all the payments are equal let's go straight into a few examples one example is saving so what if i put a hundred dollars a month into the bank for three years that's one example how about another example i'm living off of credit and every year or every semester that's twice a year or semiannually i am going to borrow five thousand dollars for living expenses this is a particular example of what we call accumulation the key here is that the balance is growing it gets bigger every month so my bank balance is higher every year every month and my debt is growing so every six months my debt is a little bit bigger let's look at some more examples of a different type of annuity uh i have a mortgage of three hundred thousand dollars every month i pay two thousand dollars and here's the second one i saved money to take a year off every quarter that's four times a year i take six thousand dollars out of savings and in this case i have a second kind of annuity this is called an amortization big fancy word which we're going to see a lot of but the gist is the balance is shrinking it gets smaller every month every period so here my debt is lower every month so every time i make a payment i have less money owing on my mortgage in the second example my bank balance is shrinking by six thousand dollars and that was a misspelled bank bank balance is shrinking so those are two kinds of things accumulation growing amortization shrinking two kinds of mortgages mortgages are divided into even more type of things so let's look at when the payment happens if it's at the end of the month or the end of the quarter or the end of the year we call that an ordinary annuity because ordinarily we pay at the end of the month oops so here we have end goes with ordinary we also have beginning so in this one actually let's give an example i pay my credit card bill at the end of the month usually when you're paying back money you pay back at the end because it seems silly to pay back the day that you borrow it when we have the beginning of the month we call that an annuity do beginning due and you can call that a begin annuity even though it's technically called an annuity due and often with a savings program the day you decide to start saving you actually start saving that's the day i'm going to put the money in and that means it's going to be begin i'm going to put this in to show you the calculator buttons and this will make more sense a little bit later when we talk about how to do this okay we've got one more step to go over and that's how often do i compound and how often do i pay so py we've seen this before this is payments per year and cy we're going to go over this in your calculator that's compounding periods per year in a simple annuity those things are the same so i deposit monthly in my bank account interest is compounded monthly that's the easiest type that's why we call it simple then we've got general the opposite of simple is general and those things are different and in the end of this unit we're going to see a lot of mortgages mortgages compound semiannually in canada but usually people pay monthly so those are the different types of uh annuities by now you've seen me write this down a lot of times these are the things that go on that tvm row of your calculator i'm just going to quickly show that we've got this tvm button row here that we've seen when we talked about compound interest py is going to be the payments per year so how many times per year do we pay this is the compounding so this is the m from j m it's how many times we compound per year n is the number of payments this we're going to get to when p y and cy are different n is a little bit harder to do we're going to talk about that in the next lesson i y is the nominal rate same as it was in compound interest rate present value is well that's the balance the beginning i'm going to put a little plus sign here to say when the present value is positive the payment is going to be positive when we accumulate and negative when we amortize so balance growing it's a plus balance shrinking it's a negative and in this case the future value is always going to be negative just to make things complicated we can always do it the opposite way so we could say that if you wanted to say your debt was a negative at the beginning then you'd add a plus because you're digging yourself out of that hole and in that case every single thing is opposite begin when begin is off that's the ending mode and begin is on and that is the begin mode and we're gonna go over that and how to use that on the calculator later starting with example one you decide to begin a savings plan starting in one year you will deposit a hundred dollars each year into an account that pays j1 equals 12 percent interest how much will you have in three years how much of that is interest let's start by drawing a timeline when you're first beginning it's really useful to draw in these timelines once you've done it for a while these basic annuities don't need them anymore but we will talk about more advanced ones so let's say that we start with no money then we're going to deposit a hundred dollars i'm putting the arrow down to show that that money is going into my account what we're doing is evaluating this at the last minute at time three algebraically using the compound interest formula that's the same as saying i've got a hundred dollars that i invest for looks like two years i've got a hundred dollars that i invest for one year and then i've got an extra hundred dollars so when we put those together i can evaluate how many of how much money i have at the end of the time that is 337 dollars and 44 cents please try this in your calculator if you would like three payments i can do that but let's say i had 100 payments i'm not going to calculate a hundred different things that's why i'm going to use the payment button for annuities so let's look at our types of annuities so the first thing i want to look at is are we accumulating or are we amortizing so here every month every year i have a little bit more money so i'm accumulating and that's because the balance is growing next i always want to look at well is it ordinary or do and those are funny words so ordinary is at the end of the year and due is at the beginning of the year here you can see and getting my first payment at the end of the first year at one not at zero so this is ordinary and finally i've got simple versus general and i'm going to actually just write that that is at the beginning end of the first year simple in general well my payments i put in a payment every year and my compounding period it compounds annually j1 equals 12 percent so those things are the same that makes this a simple ordinary annuity and now i'm going to put this in the calculator so let's start at the beginning i said that the payments were once a year and it was compounding once a year those are both one n well n here is three years because there are three payments the interest rate is 12. i start with no money this is very common in a savings and i'm going to put in a hundred dollars every year i'm putting a plus sign because my balance is growing this is an accumulation my future value i'm going to compute that but i'm going to hope that it's negative at the end begin is going to be off and we'll worry about how to use that on the calculator in the next lesson so let's calculate this i'm going to put everything in starting with pycy i make sure that that is 1 it is n is 3 our iy again was 12 present value i put in 0. now i'm going to actually put in that payment of 100 and i'm left with computing the future value and i get negative 337.44 which is exactly the same that we got by algebra often in an accumulation present value is going to be zero because we assume that we start with no money if we had money in our account we'll deal with that next lesson it's just a matter of putting a number into pv let's calculate the interest interest is money out minus money in in a savings situation how much money did i have at the end well that was 337.44 money in that was three payments of a hundred dollars when i run that through a calculator or do it in my head i get thirty seven dollars and forty four cents that's how much interest i earned over the three years 37 dollars and 44 cents example two financial planners estimate you will require an income of 2500 per month to retire you dial a psychic and discover that you're going to live exactly 15 years how much money will you need to retire if your first withdrawal will be in one month interest is going to be 9 compounded monthly so let's draw a bit of a timeline here start with the line and i'm going to start with today and then write in one month i haven't left myself a huge amount of room and i'm not going to do the whole thing i'm going to go up to here and say that's 180 months or 15 years and then here is 179 months let's start putting in some things i'm going to put some money in now i have to put some money in and i don't know what that is then i'm going to take out 2500 every single month starting one month from today and ending exactly 15 years from today where i take out my last payment and then i am going to not no longer need any money at the end of the day i don't have any money left that's important because otherwise i couldn't calculate this so let's look at this i'm putting in a bunch of money now and at the end i have zero in this case my balance is definitely shrinking so i would call this an amortization looking at my chart you can see that i'm taking those payments out at the end of the month and one thing is if it's unclear we treat it at the end of the month that's what we mean by ordinary that's the normal course of events finally we've got our py and cys so i'm taking out monthly payments and i'm compounding monthly those are the same and that's because i have j12 equals nine let's put this into the calculator and you should get used to drawing this out because we do this for every example okay in this case i said p y and c y were both 12. i can write 12 12 or i could write those together either way it's going for 15 years and that is 180 months and i'm just going to put in and that's 15 times 12. our interest rate is 9. and i'm going to start out well that's what i'm trying to find i don't know how much money i start out with but i'm going to take money out so i'm going to make this payment negative because my balance is shrinking my future value i said that should be negative as well but it's actually zero so it's a negative zero it's coming at the end of the month so begin is off so let's put this in i'm going to show you by pressing recall i still have everything in for my last example i can override overwrite that just start putting it in or i can press second clear tvm and then if you look at it everything is now zero but pycy will still need changing they don't clear when i clear that if i change p y to 12 notice that c y changes as well that's very handy for us when we're working on a simple annuity n is 180 i y is nine the present value is what i'm computing 2500 negative is the payment and future value is zero so i'll compute the present value and we get a very big number i need to have two hundred and forty six thousand four hundred and eighty three dollars and fifty two cents uh to retire today that's great if i have that much money later on we're going to talk about how you would go about trying to save that much money which makes a lot more sense so do the interest calculation we call that interest when we borrow something we call that cost of financing cost of borrowing you're going to see this a lot and that's going to be money out minus money in or the money we pay minus the money borrowed there's lots of way of doing interest but in the end you should get a positive number because it doesn't make sense to have negative five dollars of interest so in this case let's look at this question our interest payment is going to be well i took out 180 payments of 2500 and we deposited 246 483.52 and i'm going to round that so if i do this i go 180 times 2500 oops minus two four six four eight three point five two equals two hundred and three thousand dollars so we actually made quite a lot of interest and that's because we had a fairly good interest rate of nine percent but also this was invested for 15 years that's a long time for money to compound example three you've just purchased a new house for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you can afford to pay twenty six hundred dollars per month on your mortgage how long will it take you to pay off your house if interest is calculated at twelve percent compounded monthly let's just take a second to draw this i borrowed 250 000 that's going into our account and then we're going to start paying payments of 2600. those are going to come out at the end of the month monthly for a bunch of time and months and what we're going to do is find that n so firstly i borrowed money and every month i pay it back my balance is shrinking when i repay money which means that this is an amortization i'm paying at the end of the month so this is an ordinary annuity also i'm paying monthly and i'm compounding monthly because i have j12 equals 12 so this is a simple ordinary amortization let's take all the numbers from here and put them in in this case some people really like to see this as a negative number under your present value because you've borrowed that that's your debt i prefer to make everything positive in present present value so i'm going to continue to do that and then because my balance is shrinking that 2600 becomes negative my future value well it doesn't say but assume that i'm paying off all that money so my future value should be zero in the end my begin is off because it's at the end of the month j12 well everything was 12 and the interest rate was 12 what i'm trying to compute is n now just like in compound interest problems with these annuities i can calculate n i y pv payment or future value as long as i know four out of five of these things i can compute the other one using a calculator here let's just put this into our calculator so our pycy still says 12 and i'm going to compute 12 is the interest rate 250 000 for the present value i'm making my payments of negative 2600 and my future value will be zero at the end when i compute n i get 327 months and that means 327 big payments plus one little baby payment at the end and we're going to talk about those final payments later on in the course and just so we know that's around 27.3 years i'm going to be paying off this mortgage for a while i'm going to do one thing i'm going to make my pa payment positive and i'm going to recompute n notice that n is a negative number in this case n is negative 67.709 that makes very little sense it says i'm going to pay off my mortgage in negative five and a half years negative years negative time that doesn't make a lot of sense if you see a negative n means that you put an entry error and wrong when you see an error or you see something that makes no sense like a negative n you know that you've made an input error and you've pressed the wrong button example four your new car loan has payments of 499 at the end of each month for five years to pay a 25 pay for a 25 000 car what rate of interest is being charged what is the effective rate what is the cost of financing so let's look through this one as well we borrowed 25 000 and every month we're going to pay back 4.99 etc and that's going to go on for 60 months or 5 years every month the amount of money we owe on that car is shrinking that makes this one also an amortization we are always making our payments at the end of each month and it says that right in the problem so it is an ordinary annuity finally simple general well that's a little more tricky because this question is asking two things so let's do this with just a monthly rate and then we're going to do this again and see what happens if we treat this as a general annuity so let's start with py and cy both being 12 because we're making those monthly payments 60 of them we're trying to find the interest rate we started by owing 25 000 and we're making payments of 4.99 those are negative because our balance is shrinking at the end we owe nothing on the car and we're paying at the end of the month so we go into here it's clear and our pycy should still be 12. our n is going to be 60 our interest rate is what we're trying to find we're borrowing 25 000 and making payments of negative 4.99 and at the end of the day we'll own no money when i compute the interest rate i get 7.33 now there's a few things we can do i could take this interest rate and store it and then use that interest conversion worksheet that we talked about in the last section so the nominal let's put recall 1 enter now i go down i'm going to find my effective rate but i need my cy to be 12. i'm going to compute that and i find out that i have 7.5875 percent but i can treat this separately i'm gonna do this as a general annuity because we're going to start doing this in our next lesson i'm still gonna pay 12 times a year but now i'm going to compound one time a year n is 60 everything else stays the same so what i'm doing is just changing one thing in the calculator so let's clear out of this one go to second py py is 12 but now i'm going to go down and change cy to be one so when i scroll here you can see 12 1 those are different clear out of that worksheet compute the interest rate and now i get 7.5875 exactly what i got through the interest conversion worksheet so general annuities seem complicated however in the end we can do them fairly easily given that we have a good financial calculator finally let's do the cost of financing cost of financing is fancy for interest so cost of financing or cost of borrowing is a fancy way of saying interest when we borrow we say our interest is going to be the money paid minus money borrowed so in this case how much did i pay well we paid 499 dollars 60 times and borrowed 25 000 we can throw that into a calculator which i did off camera and i ended up with 4 940 that's the cost of financing one more note on this cars the sticker price on this car is actually a bigger money a bigger number let's say this car is 29 940 with zero percent financing where did i get that number well that number was 499 times 60. if a car dealership advertises zero percent financing usually this is what they mean the car is actually 29 000 or you get nine hundred and forty dollar cash discount that's for paying cash right away the real moral here is you're not getting something for nothing so that zero percent interest really means that the cost is actually 25 000 lesson 13 more annuities today we're going to look at different types of annuities simple versus general ordinary versus do for completeness sake here are the formulae that you can use to do annuities in this course we're going to be using a preprogrammed ba 2 plus calculator but if you are a person who loves algebra go ahead knock yourself out these formulas are also in the textbook first we're going to start with what we like to call five finger problems a five finger problem just means you have a problem where pv and fv and payment are not zero so we've got a present value and a future value going on i want to start with a car lease you decide to lease a new bmw automobile the vehicle costs thirty thousand dollars new and you are required to pay all taxes at the beginning of the lease the lease payments are six hundred dollars per month for three years and you know the lease in company charges interest at six percent compounded monthly i'm just going to write j12 equals six percent what is the residual value of the car and how much interest do we pay over the lifetime of the lease so let's pause for a moment and talk about car leases in car lease you don't actually buy the car all you're doing is renting it this way we pay less per month than if we bought the car outright but the problem is or the advantage is we don't get a car at the end this is great if three years after getting a car you want to trade up to a new car a lease is often the way to go at the end of the lease if you want to you can buy the car for its residual value cars depreciate over time depreciate means they're worth less than when they began a threeyearold car three even a threeyearold bmw is not going to cost thirty thousand dollars it will cost less to calculate that residual value we find out what the balance is or how much is owing at the end of those three years so let's look at this problem the balance or how much we owe starts at 30 000 but it goes down every month as we make payments that makes this an amortization but it's an amortization where fv is not going to be zero the lease payments are 600 and unless you're told that the payments are at the very beginning we usually assume that the payments are at the end of the month any payment we make at the very beginning well that goes with payments and taxes and that's how leasing often works here we're paying monthly and the interest rate is a monthly interest rate so that makes this a simple this is a simple ordinary amortization but it's different than what we've done before because the future value and the present value are not both zero let's look at the numbers in this problem the vehicle cost thirty thousand dollars originally that thirty thousand dollars is the present value of the car i like to leave this one positive we make six hundred dollar payments that's minus because the balance is shrinking the payments are at the end of the month and they are for three years so three times 12 is 36 payments and those payments and compounding are monthly the interest rate is six percent our future value is what we're trying to find we're trying to figure out what we owe on the car at the end of the three years this will have been set up by the car company so that that's the value of the car and if we choose not to buy the car somebody else might want to buy our vehicle off lease so let's scroll down and calculate this so we start as usual by going to the pycy they are not the same so we have to check py equals 12 and now they're both exactly the same n is 36. the interest rate is six our present value is thirty thousand and we're making six hundred dollar payments negative now we're going to compute the future value future value here is negative that really means that a threeyearold car is only worth 12 cents 298.75 we want to pay the car that is how much we have to pay at the end of the lease if we don't want to pay the car buy the car we can walk away at this point and we've just spent that money to rent the car over time and then someone else can step in and buy a threeyearold car for twelve thousand two hundred ninety eight dollars and seventy five cents that is the residual value let's pretend that we actually bought the car how much interest did we pay over the lifetime of this lease well our interest is always amount paid versus amount borrowed amount or money borrowed scrolling up over here well we paid taxes we didn't borrow that we don't have to worry about that we made 36 payments of six hundred dollars and we paid off that residual value how much did we borrow that was thirty thousand dollars which means that our interest was not very much it was three thousand eight hundred ninety eight dollars and seventy five cents for our bottom of the line new bmw two you are saving for your son's postsecondary education in 10 years you have 27 000 in an resp account and plan to add a thousand dollars at the end of the year for the next 10 years how much money will your son have when he goes to school in 10 years if you receive a return a 4.8 percent compounded annually on the investments this is another fivefingered problem but it's different than the last one and that's because we are accumulating money we have twenty seven thousand now and it keeps on rising it starts at twenty thousand twenty seven thousand and at the end we will have more again if we're not told it's going to be ordinary but here it says end that's a key word that we're looking for an ordinary annuity finally we have we're going to make annual payments i'm just going to put that in here and we have it compounded annually so let's put that one down right over here for cy now let's go back to the beginning and put in all of the information we start 10 years n equals 10. 27 000. well that's how much money we have at the very beginning we're gonna add a thousand dollars at the end of each year this is a plus one thousand because our balance is growing the payment is adding to the present value how much money will we have well that means future value is compute and we know that this is ordinary so we keep begin off iy 4.8 and now we have enough information to begin putting this into the calculator we start with second py and we put in one check that py and cy are both the same n is ten i y was four point eight our present value that we started with was twenty seven thousand dollars our payment is one thousand dollars per year and we're computing the future value that gives us 55 000 610.68 cents i'm just going to show you that that algebra equation that we did at the beginning that actually works the same way so if i use that equation i've got payment 1 plus i to the power of n minus 1 over i and then i'm going to add in that present value i'm going to calculate that 27 000 separately trying that in a calculator you'll get the same answer so when we do one of these five fingered problems what we really have is two problems that are adding together we have an ordinary simple annuity with the present value equals zero and we have a compound interest problem and we add those together one of the advantages of a financial calculator is we don't have to explicitly do this general annuities you are shopping for a hundred thousand dollar mortgage and the bank has quoted you a rate of j two equals six percent you will make monthly payments for twenty years how much will your payments be again this is very typical of canadian mortgages we usually have c y equals two and p y equals 12. that makes this a general annuity because we have a mortgage we're taking a hundred thousand dollar loan that's our balance at the very beginning we want our balance to shrink it's an amortization and unlike a lease it doesn't say what our n value is how much we'll owe at the end it should be zero unless you're told otherwise assume that we pay off all of our loans completely our rate is j2 equals six percent and it's a mortgage so we're going to make the payment at the end of the month any money that we spend at the very beginning that's part of a down payment so this is an ordinary general amortization we've filled that in most of this while i've been talking and payment well that's what i'm trying to find finally we just have n and that's going to be 20 times 12 that's important n always counts payments payments per year not compounding period so we're going to count how many payments we make over the lifetime of the mortgage which in the end is going to be 240 payments let's run this through we go into py and we set that equal to 12. when i scroll down you can see that cy has changed so i have to set it to be different when i scroll up you'll see when you set cy py doesn't change but when you set py cy changes i always scroll around to make sure that everything has worked correctly 100 000 present value zero is our future value compute that payment and i get an answer of 712 dollars and 19 cents we're gonna round out a little bit at the end let's talk a little bit more about general annuities when we're using those formulas what we do is we convert our interest rate to an equivalent one so that we have p y equals c y so what i would do here is i would say i've got j 2 equals 6 percent and i want to convert to j 12 equals something i'm going to do that so we go to second interest conversion our nominal rate is 6. cy is 2 i find that effective rate 6.09 so let's write what the effective rate is then i take that effective rate change cy again and go back to the nominal rate so this is what i would use in the calculation no rounding saving that entire thing that's how it works in a spreadsheet like excel and that's how it works with the formula we are lucky that we have a calculator that does that it's doing that under the hood and that's why we set it correctly so that we can use our technology correctly the important thing to always remember is that n counts payments not compounding periods so that's because things go together so if for example let's say a fiveyear mortgage monthly payments and j2 equals let's go with nine percent n is going to be 12 times 5 60 payments and it's not going to be 2 times 5 equals 10 compounding periods and that's because your calculator is actually changing that interest rate i'm gonna put a big x on this so that everybody knows that that's not there question four you want to have accumulated four thousand dollars for your european trip four years from now if interest is six point four percent compounded monthly find the size of the quarterly deposits required for four years if deposits are made at the beginning of each quarter this time we're going to go through our question and fill out what's happening as we go you want to have accumulated well to me that makes this seem like an accumulation and it is we are saving money when we save money start with something positive add something positive end up with something negative what we want to accumulate is four thousand dollars think of that negative as in i'm gonna withdraw it four years from now i'm gonna put four years under n but we're gonna have to change that once we find out what p y and cy are if interest is 6.4 percent compounded monthly 6.4 compounded monthly find the size of the quarterly deposits well py is four since those two are different we're working on a general annuity find the size of the quarterly deposits required for four years if deposits are made at the beginning of each quarter well beginning to me that looks like do and it is it's begin on so what i'm going to do is put begin on it doesn't say how much money i started with so we're going to assume we start with nothing our payment well that's what i'm going to compute so we have an accumulation that is a general annuity due let's go through the entry on this and i'm going to show you how to turn begin on in the calculator first let's go into our py and change it to 4 but now our cy has changed so set it to b12 again i like to scroll around the arrows a few times and make sure that everything is set the way i want before i clear out n was four years so n is going to be four years times four payments per year that means we're making 16 payments 16. the interest rate is 6.4 the present value well we start with nothing payment that's what i'm trying to find and my future value is four thousand dollars i'm making that a negative because i will withdraw it begin above the payment button you'll see bgn that stands for begin so we go second payment or begin and then we press second set that turns begin mode on when begin mode is on you'll see that begin in the top of the calculator to turn it off you do the same thing second begin second set that set toggles through begin and end so here we've got begin now all i have to do is compute that payment and the payment is going to be 217.70 i'm going to write that down second payment begin begin lives over the payment because it refers to the payment second set which lives above the enter you'll be doing this a lot end is the default mode and you can see that when we have end nothing shows up here when begin is on that makes it an annuity due five you deposit one thousand dollars at the end of each quarter into an account that pays j4 equals ten percent find the future value in one year let's go through this question we are depositing a thousand dollars so our balance is growing and we're depositing that at the end of each quarter end or begin off let's draw that in we put a thousand dollars in at the end of each quarter and at the end how much money do we have we're going to assume we start with nothing j4 equals 10 percent 4 10 and we're making quarterly payments first of all we're accumulating money our balance is growing we're making our payments at the end of the month so this is an ordinary annuity finally py equals cy this is just a simple ordinary annuity same as we have had many times before look at my calculator note that begin is still on from the last thing i did so i'm going to start by going second begin second set and clearing that making sure it's not on there then i'm going to fill in everything in the calculator making sure that py and cy are the same uh n is four quarters in one year 10 iy our payment is a thousand dollars and we started with nothing and i'm computing how much money we have at the end i get a future value of four one five two point five two that's how much money i have at the end let's do it again b you make the deposits at the beginning of the quarter how much money will you have at the end of the year draw this in and show you that it looks very similar except one payment comes in right now at today and the last payment comes in at three quarters and we're still trying to find the future value at one year i'm still accumulating but now this is an annuity do it's still simple in fact everything else remains exactly the same as it was before the only difference is this begin toggle i usually write on to mean beginners on off for end but you can write begin and end or do in ordinary everything's still in my calculator so all i have to do is go second payment sorry i have now set that payment wrong a thousand dollar payment second begin second set to turn it on now everything is exactly the same and all i have to do is compute that future value which is similar let's scroll down and write down our future value 4256.32 cents it's similar but it's bigger that's because our payments had a little bit more time to grow because i started earlier how much money do i have in three months what about in three months this time i'm going to take my initial answer from a and see what happens three months after the scenario from a ends so at the fifth quarter so i'm going to just use my equations here instead of the compound using the calculator but you can do whichever you would like to do so we've got four thousand one hundred fifty two dollars and fifty two cents and we're going to invest that at two and a half percent per quarter that's ten divided by four for only one quarter when i run that through a calculator i end up with four thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars and thirty three cents this is round off error from the fact that i rounded this 4 152 in fact when you take your ordinary annuity and multiply it by one plus i you get the same value as the annuity do question six you begin a savings plan at the beginning of each month you deposit 250 dollars into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent how much money will you have after five years this is a savings or accumulation i'm going to go ahead and put in my signs present value and payment will be positive future value will be negative at the beginning of each month begin is on that makes this an annuity do you deposit 250 balance is growing and it's the beginning of each month so our payment is monthly into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent j 12 equals nine percent p y and cy are the same that makes this a simple annuity do and it's an accumulation how much money will you have after five years well five times 12 is 60. we make 60 payments it doesn't say anything about starting with money but it does ask how much we'll have at the end notice that my calculator says begin already so i could change that if i didn't want it second begin second set i want the begin to be turned on let's go into py and set it to be 12. check that cy is also 12 and clear out 60 is n 9 is iy 0 is present value 250 is payment and i'm going to compute the future value which is 18 997 and 45 cents so i have 18 997 dollars and 45 cents let's see how much interest we made that's going to be money out how much money we took out minus how much money we deposited so when i put this in i took out eighteen thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars and forty five cents and we put in sixty payments of two hundred and fifty dollars so 60 times 250 well that was 15 000 dollars which means that we have 3997.45 cents that we've made in interest we looked at a lot of different types of annuities today we've seen annuities that are accumulation and amortization annuities that are ordinary and annuities that are due as well as simple and general annuities i'm going to conclude by writing in all of our calculator things again py counts the number of payments cy counts the number of compounding periods the important thing here is that n is going to be p y times years so i'm going to put that in a different color n counts payments not compounding periods when we have something like a j m we put that in i y and the m is the same as the compounding period when these things are the same that's called simple and when they're not the same we call that general present value i like to always make it positive our future value then can just go ahead and be negative our payment is going to be positive when our balance is growing and negative when our balance is shrinking and that's going to be an accumulation or an amortization we can do this opposite minus minus plus and then this would end up being a plus i'm going to go ahead and say there is an exception to this but in general present value and future value tend to be the opposite in the simple situations we go over in this class begin when begin is on it's an annuity due and we begin as off it's an ordinary and when it's off we call that end mode you can see there's an end showing up on my calculator again when we do an annuity we always look is it an accumulation or is it an amortization is it ordinary is it due is it simple or is it general these are the three questions we ask ourselves when we start doing an annuity problem lesson 14 deferred and backtoback annuities today we're going to do a series of twostep problems these problems are going to have two parts to them in some of them the first part is going to be a compound interest problem we call that a deferred annuity and in some of them the first and the second are both going to be different types of annuities we call those backtoback annuities let's jump right in with a problem you plan to retire in 21 years you will need 25 annual payments of thirty thousand dollars with the first payment to be received in twenty one years interest is calculated at ten percent effective and this is of course an approximation because interest rates won't stay the same for 46 years but we usually pretend they will in order to do calculations a how much money should we set aside for our retirement i've started this with a timeline and i've already drawn it in it has two parts to it one let's go to 21 years when our first payment happens and then it keeps on going until our last payment which is going to be at 45 because that will give us 25 annual payments one at one one at two all the way to twenty five today we're going to put some money in so let's put some money in this today and then i'm going to circle this because this is a very key point we're going to invest it for 21 years and then we're going to start pulling money out so we have two problems here problem one is a compound interest problem and problem two is an annuity it's not just any type of the annuity it's an annuity due because it starts right at the beginning at 21 and it is possible to set this up so that it starts at 20 but in this case it seems to make more sense to start at 21. so compound interest let's look at our values we start off with i don't know how much money i make payments of well nothing because it's a compound interest problem at the end of the day i have some money i don't exactly know how much let's change this color here to make it more exciting at the beginning of this annuity which is exactly at 21 i have however much money i saved in the first compound interest problem my payments well those are going to be 30 000 and i'm going to make that negative because we can see that they're coming out of our account i'm going to start writing 30k so i don't have to write a bunch of zeros and our future value well that's gonna be zero unless we're told otherwise always assume that we have no money left at the end of one of these problems so we have to solve these one at a time and here we have two unknowns here two and here we only have one unknown so we're gonna start with two because we only have the one unknown so let's start by drawing in our calculator buttons okay all nicely drawn very fast we're going to start with number two so i'm going to put a 2 in here in this whole problem our py and cy are both one that makes these a simple annuity because everything in sight is annual and our interest rate is 10. this annuity goes on for 25 years or 25 payments i want to figure out what the present value is my payment will be thirty thousand dollars and my future value is zero it's an annuity due so i need to make sure that begin is turned on i usually like to do that first so let's turn that on here and now let's put in the rest p y and c y are both one again i always check that they both entered properly interest rate is 10 present value is what i'm going to find should i get that 25n yep i have these in the wrong order i'm gonna go ahead and fix that because it's going to confuse me better i y present value our payment is thirty thousand dollars negative and our future value ends up being zero so we're going to compute that present value and we get 299.542.32 what that means is the day we retire i'm going to say we could be you we need to have saved a lot of money 299 542 and 32 cents that could be around thirty thousand dollars so let's look at saving that much so what we're going to do now is part one of our problem so part one let's just scroll up to look at that is a compound interest problem where i'm trying to figure out how much money to put in zero payments begin doesn't matter when the payment is zero dollars it doesn't matter if i put zero dollars in my account at the beginning or the end of the year so i can just leave that alone we know that n is 21. future value is 299 000. the easiest way to do this is while it's showing up on my screen i press that negative sign and now i just press future value and it's stored in there so let's go ahead and change everything begin doesn't matter so i'm going to leave it pycy should stay the same n is now 21. our interest rate recall iy is still 10. our payment is zero that's an important one remember our future value has changed so let's compute that present value and we find out that we need to invest 40 000 477 and 32 cents right now if we do that we put 40 000 in today we will have enough so that we can have 30 000 a year for twenty five years so thirty thousand per year that is great in part a of this question we figured out that if we can save forty thousand dollars right now put that in the bank today then we're fine to retire the problem is i don't actually have forty thousand dollars to invest so instead of making one payment right here at the beginning what we're going to do is put 21 payments in starting today so i'm gonna put in a payment every year and we're talk and save slowly over 21 years so that i will be able to get that thirty thousand dollars at the end let's look at this again as a twostep problem step one this is now an annuity do and it's an accumulation because we're saving it's also still going to be simple because j1 is still 10 and py is going to be 1 for everything so everything in sight will be simple so now i've got an annuity due that is an accumulation i'm not going to save any money at the beginning but i am going to start putting in payments and at the end i will have well we actually know that so put a pin in that for one minute let's look at number two this is the same thing and i'm going to write here that this is an amortization often these backtoback problems are one accumulation followed by an amortization a retirement scheme has us save save saving spend spend spending so we know at the end we have nothing we know what the payments are they are thirty thousand dollars and they're negative because it's an amortization and actually we know what the money is that we should be saving it is 299 000. because we've done that already so that's really useful that means that we've already done half this problem in general it's important to save all of our intermediate values so if i go back to that future value we're going to use that i'm going to store that in one just so i have it just in case even though we've already done the second annuity i'm going to still rewrite this so we can see everything all together remember it was a 21year annuity we were computing the present value we were taking 30 000 out zero begin was on we computed that and we got 299 etc then we're going to go ahead and do number one this is also a simple annuity p y and cy equals 1. now our n is still 25 and our interest rate is 10 but our present value is going to be zero and we're going to be computing those intermediate payments the amount of money we need is still negative 299.54 and begin is still on so looking at this it's almost exactly what we did last time only we're switching the present value and future value we can just go ahead and check our pycy we know that stays the same n should still be 25 our iy has stayed the same but our present value is now zero and our payment is what we're going to find so future value is still negative 299 and you can see there that that begin is on so i'm going to compute the payment 4 254 and 70 cents that's not so bad that's how much money we need to save annually starting today so let's write that down so if we have 4 200 and we think we can come up with that every year we will have enough to retire let's start looking at some interest let's look at interest instead of just part a i'm actually going to start with b sorry start with a our interest is going to be the money out minus money n so we took out 30 000 and we did 25 of those payments and we put in well we know how much we put in we put in exactly forty thousand four seven seven and thirty two cents note nowhere do i see that intermediate 299 thousand dollars that's because i didn't actually withdraw or deposit that i left it in the bank so it doesn't end up being part of this interest calculation 30 000 times 25 well that's 750 000 and let's subtract 4477 and 32 cents well i've made quite a lot of interest there 709 522 and 68 cents and that's because i have a lot of time we have 45 years on this scenario that's a lot of time to save and we end up with a lot of interest especially at 10 which would probably be an average in b this is almost going to be the same except now i'm still putting in that same 30 000 times 25 but i'm putting in 21 payments of 4 200. so looking at this let's go back to 30 000 times 25 we're going to subtract 21 times 4254.7 and that leaves us with 660 651 and 30 cents not as much as an a because we didn't put the money in the whole time but still quite a lot of money i'm leaving this last part up to you i would like you to finish this question noting that the answers are at the back knowing that in this case instead of making our payments starting today we're going to start in one year our last payment goes in at 21 and our 30 000 payments still come out at the same time in this case let's put our last 30 000 payment this is going to be an ordinary annuity and the second one is going to be an annuity due so the second annuity stays exactly like it was before but this time the first one is an ordinary annuity the answers are going to be they're in the handout at the beginning of this chapter and we will go over this in lab you are saving money for your retirement starting in six months and for five years you invest fifteen hundred dollars every six months in a mutual fund that pays six percent compounded semiannually after five years the rate drops to four point eight percent compounded quarterly and you decide to deposit a thousand dollars every quarter for another five years how much money will you have at the end of the ten years this is another backtoback annuity but in this one they're both going to be accumulations because we keep on saving we're never going to amortize or take money out of that account that's good to note in our first one it is going to be every half year and we're going to start in six months one year 1.5 all the way 4.5 so for every six months we're going to start depositing money i'm going to draw that in we're going to deposit 1500 and our last deposit is going to go in right at that five years after this it's going to drop to quarterly so let's do a quarter half three quarters six years etc etc all the way up to 10 years and that's a quarter less than that so nine and three quarter of a year here we're going to be putting in a thousand dollars each quarter and it's going to be at the end of the quarter because we're not putting it in twice at a time when we're not told we're always putting it in at the end let's look at our two annuities one this is still an annuity but because it starts six months from now it's an ordinary annuity okay we start with no money we put in fifteen hundred dollars every six months and at the end we have something let's look at the second one over here at the beginning of the second five years and this is the important time we have some money the present value of that second annuity is equal to the future value of the first and this is almost always true in backtoback annuities because this one starts at the end of the quarter it's still an ordinary annuity now we have payments of a thousand dollars and at the end we have money looking over here we've got two unknowns future value and present value so we can't do anything here we have only one unknown that's why we're going to start with number one okay we're gonna put everything in our calculator and i'm gonna start with one i like to label these so i know which one is which in this case the payments are semiannual and the compounding looks like it's semiannual and you can even write the compounding up here on the timeline if you think that makes things easier j4 equals 4.8 i think it does so in here i'm gonna put six percent and my n is going to be five years times twice a year so ten my present value well that's going to be zero because i start with nothing but we're putting fifteen hundred dollars in the future value that's what we're going to try to find and begin is off so let's go through the calculator i'm going to start by turning off the begin because this is an ordinary annuity now we're going to set py and you are welcome to fast forward if you're tired of watching me put stuff in a calculator fascinating zero present value 1500 that's positive because we're accumulating and i'm going to compute our future value so 17 000 ish i'm going to write that right in i'm going to store this because i might need it for later i don't know i i personally do but you wouldn't know it's always good to store those intermediate values now let's start setting up annuity number two this one is quarterly payments but also quarterly compounding and our interest rate is 4.8 it's going to be five times four so we've got 20 payments and our present value is 17 195 and 81 cents payment is a thousand future value is a compute and our begin is still going to be off so let's put input things into the calculator make this positive now that's the present value starting at the side i have p y c y is 4 our n is now 20 important 4.8 is the interest rate the present value we've done payment is a thousand and the future value is what we're trying to compute we end up with an answer of 44 000 dollars forty four thousand two hundred and eighty one dollars and eighty three cents that's how much money we have let's pretend we take that out of the bank let's find out how much interest we made so our interest is money out minus money in in this case we took out our savings our life savings of forty four thousand two hundred eighty one dollars and eighty three cents we put in 10 payments of 1500 and we put in 20 payments of a thousand running that through a calculator we've actually made quite a lot of interest which is ninety two hundred dollars so nine thousand two hundred eighty one dollars and eighty three cents follow along on your calculator to make sure you get the right answers question three you would like to save enough to take a two year sabbatical in 15 years starting today you make your first of 180 monthly deposits of 500 into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent write that in here one month after making your last deposit you take your first of 24 monthly payments find the size of these payments this is again a backtoback annuity problem so i'm going to reiterate the important things that we need to do one is we have to draw a timeline and having a focal date and circling it right here on it is going to be really important in getting this right i'm going to take the time to identify our annuities and store all of our intermediate values and an important thing is to pay really close attention to the begin and end on our calculator so let's start by drawing in things first of all 15 years is when we start and it's a two year sabbatical so and we're going to start making monthly everything is monthly that's okay we can just put in little dashes for months and we know what that means starting today i'm going to make my first payment so i'm going to say that this is right away and it is five hundred dollars if i start today then i'm going to end one month before 15 years from now that's going to give me the right number of payments which is 180. because i'm starting right away i'm going to note that this is an annuity deal and that's annuity number one for new need number two well one month after i make my last deposit that's going to be exactly at 15 i'm going to start taking out my 24 monthly payments and those well i don't know what they are but i do know that at the end of this i'm not going to have any money so this is also an annuity due let's look at the steps of these and these are both simple annuities and what we have is we have an accumulation we accumulate accumulate save save save and then we spend spend spend knowing this is going to get our signs correct starting well i'm going to assume because i didn't say anything about this i have no money at the beginning we could have started with something and then it would be as easy as putting that number in i'm going to start making payments of 500 and at the end i will have something second annuity i'm going to start with well that same something i had last time because those are at the same points this is two my payment in this annuity is going to be something and my future value at the end will be zero because i'm going to spend all of that money two unknowns here one unknown here means i should start with one you'll probably get sick of drawing the same thing out over and over again but i've found when i don't write it and when i don't do it in the right order which i occasionally do i start making mistakes so putting everything in the calculator writing it out really helps us not make mistakes i'm gonna start with annuity one everything here is going to be monthly my n well that's 180 because it's written in there and that's 15 times 12. the interest rate is 9 for the entire time start with nothing and i put in 500 and then we're going to figure out the future value begin is on i'm going to go ahead and start filling in the second annuity as well and i like to sometimes set these up before i even start so everything is very quick 24 monthly payments my present value is going to be this number i'll put that in there and here that's what i'm going to be computing and i'll end up with nothing and it's still an annuity due starting with this and again fast forward if you're really good at putting stuff in your calculator 12 i check that that's correct uh n is 180 i y is 9. present value zero payment is five hundred dollars future value is what i'm computing and begin mode is not on so let's go to set make sure that begin mode is on now i can compute the future value and what i'm going to end up with is let's use a different color why not i apologize if you are colorblind and cannot see all my beautiful colors it's okay 190 000 621 and 91 cents i'm gonna store this again store one because i might need it later but i'm also going to just go ahead and plus minus put that right into present value that's very useful okay let's do the second annuity 12 should stay the same but n is now 24. i usually press recall and then i y to make sure that it's correct and then i haven't done anything recall present value is correct recall payment well i don't even know about payment so i'm going to leave that alone and i'm going to make sure that my future value is zero begin is still on so compute the payment i get 8 643.68 so we need actually not we need we will have eight thousand six four three point sixty eight sixty nine per month that's a pretty good amount to live off of let's look at part b i've actually just copied everything we just did and i'm going to redo it except now two months after making our last deposit that means instead of having a payment come out here at 15 our first payment comes out one month later and our last payment comes out here what does that do well that makes this an ordinary annuity let's erase that and i'm going to use another color this time it's an ordinary annuity what else changes the first part doesn't change at all still in amortization everything is the same except for this begin right over here all we're going to do to make this different is change this to off i'm going to highlight these changes that's it all we've done here is change one button that means that everything is already properly stored in my calculator so if i go to second begin second set and turn that begin mode off and now i'm going to recompute that payment with everything identical i get the correct answer we will have eight thousand seven hundred eight dollars and fifty one cents per month if we start one month later so these questions are almost the same the only difference was in that begin on or begin off let's summarize what we've done today on backtoback and deferred annuities these are twostep problems in order to get them correct we are going to have to take our time and write things out having graded about 5000 tests testing this draw a timeline when people don't draw a timeline and take the time to label it correctly they usually make a mistake circle that focal date that's an important day let's identify those annuities and those annuities the first one can often be a compound interest problem we do it in the same way we just have payment equals zero so we look for the problem with only one unknown and that's the one we're going to solve first if we have something with two unknowns then we should solve that one second because we won't be able to do it an important point we're going to store those intermediate values with their decimals because we keep those unless we're taking money out and putting it in a different bank we can carry all those decimals with us pay really close attention to begin and end so write that down on your piece of paper put that in your calculator make sure you do that think about your counting and at the end of the day an important thing is to remember that interest is the money you withdraw minus the money that you put in that's the same as money paid minus money borrowed out and in are just expressions but if we're borrowing money we usually write it this way intermediate values don't go in here that's an important thing to note and actually i'm going to write one more thing round your payments because we're going to put in a bunch of payments but we have to round to the nearest set because we can't put in a half a cent lesson 15 bonds perpetuities and stocks we're going to start by learning about coupon bonds and i should put a date on this when governments and companies want to raise money sometimes they issue things called bonds this bond has a face value of one thousand dollars and i'm going to explain what that means as we go what that means is you buy actually i'm gonna write down the coupon rate is at six percent okay you buy this bond for one thousand dollars for however long the time period is every six months and bonds tend to be semiannual you get a coupon payment or your interest is calculated and sent to you so we're not compounding the interest the person who owns the bond is getting that interest i've written this as an oldfashioned coupon bond where there's literally a bunch of coupons and when you pull them off you get money at the end of the time period and that here is going to be in december 2025 you get your thousand dollars back so the money the interest is being calculated every six months and you get that so this bond has a face value of a thousand dollars a coupon rate of six percent compounded semiannually and it has a maturity of 10 years that means that for 10 years you get these payments what's the semiannual coupon payment for this we're just coming up with the interest after one half year or the simple interest so the coupon payment is really the interest accrued in one period or here it's going to be six months and i'm going to say that often bonds are semiannual so our interest here is going to be i equals prt because we're just using simple interest our interest is going to be the principal that's a thousand dollars the rate well that's just going to be the periodic rate so if it's six percent divided by two and t well that's where that divided by two comes from so six months for one or is it 0.06 times a half that's 30 and that's where i got this 30 up here so every six months you get a check in the mail for 30 dollars let's look at this bond in a timeline so this goes on for 10 years and every six months we get a payment so i'm gonna put in a payment of thirty dollars thirty dollars every six months starting from there we get thirty dollars at the very end we still get thirty dollars but we also get a thousand dollars this is in fact an ordinary annuity how much did we pay for this originally we paid one thousand dollars the face value the interesting thing here comes when we don't keep it for the full 10 years bonds are financial instrument just like stocks and we can sell them on the open market on the bond market in this case it's usually useful to calculate what we call fair market value so fair market value how much somebody else would pay for the bond so right now it's three years later so that means i'm just gonna write in seven years are left anybody can go and buy a similar bond the same type of bond at eight percent so how much do you think somebody would pay for our bond which is in fact at six percent so this is what we're going to be computing so looking at this we have the exact same timeline except for the fact that we only have seven years remaining three years have already happened so the timeline here just has to do with the fact that there's only seven years left looking at this this is an ordinary annuity ordinary begin is off it's also simple because looks like our interest rate is eight percent compounded semiannually and our coupon payments are semiannual that makes this a simple ordinary annuity i'm going to go through and calculate all of this and i'm going to note this iy isn't six anymore it's changed to what the market is so that's important you're using your new interest rate and that's how many coupon payments are left and that is well we have seven years of twice a year payments 14 payments left present value is what we're trying to compute that's going to be our fair market value the payment well that was that thirty dollars and future value that's the thousand dollars we get at the end this is important these two are going to have the same sign you can make them both positive or both negative but they have to have the same sign i'm just going to write down some notes on this so you remember payments left present value is fair market value that's what we're computing almost always this is our new rate the payment that's the old rate times the face value or future value it's kind of nice that the face value and future value both have the same initials i would say ordinarily this is an ordinary annuity i can't see very many opportunities where it isn't and i am going to put in a little note here that these have the same sign they're either both positive or they're both negative and you can choose which it is but they have to be the same so let's just bump that in so we go into pycy make sure it's 2 14 8 percent our payment is 30 and a thousand dollars is the future value so now all i'm going to do is compute that present value and i get that the fair market value is 840 894 dollars and 37 cents it's less than a thousand and that's because anybody can get forty dollar payment that's eight percent divided by two times a thousand if anybody can get a payment of forty dollars why would they want our payment of only thirty dollars the answer is only if the price is discounted let's try one more how much is the bond worth if you sell it in four years and the interest rate for similar bonds is five percent compounded semiannually that means anybody buying a similar bond has a coupon payment of a thousand dollars times 0.05 over 2 which is 25 so our 30 bond should be worth more now four years means six years left which makes our n six times two means we have 12 payments again our py and cy are two our interest rate has gone down to five present value is what we're going to compute and our payment and future value stay the same and still an ordinary annuity so all i'm going to change here because i have everything already in my calculator is 12 and 5 i way and we can always go recall and then press something to make sure it is correct now i'm just going to recompute that present value and i find out that the fair market value has gone up it's actually 1051.29 which makes sense we've locked in at a higher rate that makes it more valuable than bonds that are selling right now a perpetuity is an annuity that goes on forever how does this work this works by paying out only the interest which leaves the principal untouched our payment here is going to be just like the bond the amount of interest accrued in one period so if we have a periodic rate of i as we often do and we have a principle of pv in the bank we end up with this payment equals pv times i and i'm just going to note that this is just like a bond payment and just like a bond payment that payment is coming out of the bank so what we're doing is we're looking at the interest that accrues every month or year or six months we're taking all that interest and we're spending it i'm going to take this equation and i'm going to solve for pv by dividing both sides by i remembering i can't be zero or this doesn't make any sense whatsoever here i've got two important equations and you will have these on tests these are called the ordinary perpetuity formulas okay a wealthy bcit alumnus has decided to make an endowment to the school of business to fund an annual scholarship for the best business math student she will donate fifteen thousand dollars and the funds will be invested at six point six percent effective how much will the annual scholarship be the first scholarships in one year so we're gonna deposit fifteen 000 and then every year we're going to take out the interest when are we going to stop never this goes on in perpetuity which means forever we've got j1 equals 6.6 percent well that's the same as a periodic rate of 6.6 percent a year here using the formulas from above our payment is going to be 15 000 times 0.066 which gives us 990 dollars b if they decide to give out the first scholarship today instead of next year how much will the alumnus have to donate to keep the exact same scholarship from part a i'm going to draw this in one more time now we're going to put in something and immediately we're going to take out 990 dollars this is a one year 990 etc forever and forever in perpetuity this is a different type of perpetuity it's called unsurprisingly a perpetuity do perpetuity do starts today so the first payment is immediate just like with an annuity do so we are going to need how much money well we need from our earlier one this much to start in a year so it's payment over i plus one extra payment of 990 for right now let's put that in so we're going to need 990 dollars over 6.6 plus 9.90 that is well it's 15 000 that's what we needed before plus 990. so 15 990. that's the perpetuity due formula i'm going to rewrite this one present value equals payment over i plus payment moving this around and solving for payment which i encourage you to do as an algebra exercise but you don't need to if you try to solve this for payment using some factoring you end up with this payment equals i times present value or present value times i divided by 1 plus i you're taking it back one period in time these are the perpetuity do formula so let's just write that down and using these we can do everything we want if she decides to keep her endowment at 15 000 how much will the annual scholarship be if the first scholarship is today so this is asking us to find payment of a perpetuity due so that's going to be this equation over here i'm going to write this down i times present value divided by 1 plus i which is 0.066 times that fifteen thousand dollars divided by 1.066 let's actually look at this 15 000 times 0.066 that's that 990 we had before and we're gonna divide it by one year of interest that gives us 928 and 71 cents it's going to be less because we have one less year to accrue interest the win it all lottery offers you two choices for a grand prize either cash prize of 1.5 million dollars or seven thousand dollars per month forever with the first payment today what should you select if interest is six percent monthly so we've got two methods here i'm going to use the first method and then i'm going to try the second one let's find the pv of both options well option one so let's go a 1.5 million dollars has a pv of well that's 1.5 million dollars it's just getting that money up front now let's look at option b that was seven thousand dollars a month starting today that is a perpetuity due and our i is going to be well six percent monthly is a half a percent per month and our payment is seven thousand so our present value is going to be payment over i plus payment which is the same as seven thousand dollars divided by 0.005 plus 7 000 which gives us you can do that on your calculator follow along i've done this already and it gives me about 1.4 million dollars so i don't know about you i choose this i prefer to have 1.5 million dollars right away than something that has a present value of only 1.4 million dollars but let's try this again so let's do method two if i invest that 1.5 million dollars in a perpetuity due so if i took that 1.5 million dollars and i put it in the bank and i pulled out money every single month forever how much money would that be so if we took that cash and put it in this is kind of a stranger method but the interesting thing is that we're going to end up with a similar answer so i'm just going to use this formula i is still .005 my present value is 1.5 million and i'm going to divide that by 1.005 so let's just do that over here 1.5 million times 0.005 and i'm going to divide that by 1.005 and it looks like i've got a payment as 7 4 6 2 and 69 cents and this is better so i prefer 7 400 a month to 7 000 a month the important thing is that no matter what we do a is going to be the better option that's most of what there is to perpetuities but perpetuities could get complicated we can get deferred perpetuities that means perpetuities that start maybe 10 years from now or after an annuity so we can combine perpetuities uh with an annuity or a compound interest problem to get something way more complicated we can also get general perpetuities so when p y and c y are different this becomes really complicated so what we're going to do is do a calculator cheat it's a cheat or a trick because our calculator isn't really supposed to do this but we can make this work by pretending that n is very big so really we want our money to last forever but if we made our money it lasts for a thousand years we're going to be okay the round off between this is almost nothing so let's do part c again in part c i'm going to do the calculator buttons so in part c we had something where the annual rate was 6.6 percent our payments were annual and our compounding period was annual but we could change that i'm gonna make this last a thousand years putting in a bunch of nines will also work if your n is too too big you might end up stalling out your calculator so a thousand years seems to get pretty good results our present value was fifteen thousand dollars our payment that's what we were computing we're pretending we run out of money that's the important thing and it's due so here is an important thing it's not going to be zero we're pretending it's zero everything else is the same i'm going to go with 1000 years so if we had py was 12 and would be 12 000. so just multiply your py by a thousand and that seems to not jam out the calculator so let's go through this make our py and cy1 n is a thousand years six point six is our interest our present value was fifteen thousand dollars our payment was nothing and our future value was zero and begin is on so let's compute what the payment was and this was question one part c that payment was going to be exactly what we got 928 and 71 cents stocks or dividend stocks this is a coupon bond basically that just goes on forever so this is a combination of bonds in the first first part of this lesson and perpetuities from the second part so i'm just gonna simplify totally simplify the stock process obviously it's always more complicated so to simplify we're always going to sell right after we get a dividend payment why do we do this that makes this ordinary if i do it that way then i'm only calculating ordinary perpetuities and that's always going to be easier two now here's the big if assume that our dividends are a constant number and this is a really big if if you guys have know anything about the stock market you know that stocks go up and down the dividends will change as the company does better or worse because dividends are part of the profits and that is not going to be a constant but for the purpose of assessing fair market value we say hey the payment that's going on right now will probably go on forever at the easiest stocks are really just the easiest simple ordinary perpetuities you purchase some preferred shares that have a semiannual dividend of a dollar 25. how much should you pay for the shares if the interest is five percent compounded semiannually and the first dividend is in six months this is going to be a simple ordinary perpetuity so our interest rate is five percent compounded semiannually or two and a half percent and this is a simple ordinary perpetuity one note i've put in some semiannual ones here to make it more similar to the ones that we did earlier in general stocks tend to be quarterly so expect to see quarterly payments and compounding so let's look at this our fair market value is the present value which makes it payment over i in this case that's going to be a dollar 25 divided by 0.025 or let's work this out 1.25 divided by .025 50 so those stocks are worth fifty dollars each and every six months you get a check in the mail for a dollar twenty five let's try it again you purchase the shares in question four for fifty dollars each i'm gonna write in in each and then interest rate rises to eight percent compounded semiannually how much would you make or lose and here it's going to be per stock because we don't know how many stocks there are our new fair market value as the stock market has changed is going to be a dollar 25 over our new periodic interest rate eight percent divided by two is 0.04 which gives us 31.25 that's how much each stock is worth so that means we have a loss i'm putting in brackets here capital because this is a capital loss of 50 minus 31.25 per stock or 18.75 per share or per stock why don't i say capital because if i have actually held on to the stock for a while i've gotten a bunch of payments and we don't use those payments when we're computing the profit and loss that's more for tax reasons and i'm not going to get into that just know here we're only looking at the value not of those dividends how much money would you make or lose if the interest rate was now six percent effective and we're just still going to assume the first dividend is in six months that makes this an ordinary perpetuity but it's no longer going to be simple because we get payments twice a year but we compound once a year so now this is going to be a general perpetuity anytime it's general uh we are allowed to convert that interest rate using interest conversion but it's easier just to use the calculator again future value is zero and n is going to be a thousand years which is 2 000 payments it's two times a thousand and why do i do that multiplying by two it really does mean that the round off is less than a cent in almost all cases and we don't get into trouble for using what's really an approximation method or a trick going into here i'm going to start with my pycy set my py to 2 my cy has changed so i'll make that different i always like to scroll around there make sure i did it properly our n is now 2 000 and our interest rate is 6. present value is what i'm computing a dollar 25 is the payment and i need to make sure that i put in 0 for the future value compute the present value and now i get a fair market value of 42.28 cents per share which is still a loss because i bought them for 50 so i'm taking a loss and that's going to end up being well let's make this negative and add a fifty seven dollars and 72 cents per share is our loss lesson 16 mortgages and amortization part one the key to today's work is that balance is decreasing in a mortgage that's why it's called amortization it's when we are paying off a loan conventionally mortgages are paying off a building or a house but this could be anything paying off a car loan an rv a boat any makes sense what we're going to do first is go over some of the vocabulary first we have balance how much do we owe at a given time next we have principal how much of the mortgage we have paid off with those two we have this formula the balance that's how much we owe right now plus the principal how much we've paid off is the amount of the original mortgage how much we borrowed originally next we have interest and we should be very familiar with this one so far the interest is all the other money we paid so we have all the money we paid minus the interest is the money we borrowed or original mortgage for example i bought a house that cost six hundred thousand dollars with a down payment of a hundred thousand dollars i've made two hundred thousand dollars worth of payments and today the balance is four hundred and fifty thousand dollars the original mortgage was for five hundred thousand dollars because one hundred thousand was money i paid in cash and it's not part of this in any way so principal paid is going to be 50 000 because it's worth 450 000 today i'm going to use k for thousand that's how much principle we've paid interest is the rest of the stuff the interest that we've paid is going to be 150 000 finally the balance today well we know that that's 450 000. i'm gonna put some abbreviations in because our calculator uses these balance is bell int is interest p r n is principal and the original mortgage i'm going to call that the pv because it's the present value of our equation more things to talk about we've talked about this word before but we have to redefine amortization the amortization is the full length of the loan typically 20 to 25 years so that's over the entire lifetime this is different than the term of the loan the term is the length of time that the interest rate is fixed and the payments are fixed we usually say it's between three and seven years it's almost always five years over this term you know what your payments are and you've locked in at an interest rate at the end of the term the interest rate could change and odds are it will change let's start with an example you've just purchased a new house and taken a mortgage for a hundred thousand dollars the interest rate is 12 compounded monthly and you will make payments for 25 years find the size of the monthly payment so here we're going to assume that the amortization is 25 years and so we're going to work out our payments as if we're paying for 25 years we know though that our term is probably shorter after five years interest rates will have gone up or down depending on what's going on in the world so let's fill out our calculator our mortgage is for a hundred thousand dollars i like to make my present value positive but some people really like to make them negative to show that they're borrowing money either one is fine with me as long as your present value and your payment are opposite signs your future value though should always be zero because when you pay off a loan you pay it off completely unless you're told otherwise with a mortgage any money you pay at the beginning is considered part of the down payment so we're always going to treat this as an ordinary annuity in this case our interest rate is 12 compounded monthly and we're going to make payments let's assume those are monthly payments because that's typical for 25 years so 25 times 12 is 300 years in general you're going to see that mortgages in canada tend to be general annuities but for now we're going to stick with something fairly simple so let's work this out start with pycy make that 12 already seem to be there 300 is our month our interest rate is 12 high interest rate we borrowed a hundred thousand dollars that's our payment our present value and our future value is zero so when i compute payment i end up with this number this is really important you can't pay 22.4 cents if we round it down a little at the end of 25 years we'd owe the bank money the bank is not okay with that so with our payment we're always going to round up sometimes to the next cent and then our payment would be and we're going to do this negative 1053.23 or even next dollar sometimes we might even round up to the next hundred dollars in this case it says in the next cent sent is two decimal places we're going to be using our calculator to do a lot of the work for us so we need it to be correct in order to do that we're going to have to reenter our payment it's a really important step 1053.23 press payment and then press compute n now you'll notice i've got a negative n that's because i forgot that negative sign on purpose but still if your n makes no sense you know you made a mistake let's go back to that payment and make it negative and when i recompute the n now i should get something a tiny tiny bit smaller nine four nine eight seven so you're looking for something that's a tiny bit smaller than 300 or your original n that means you're going to make 299 payments of the same size and one ittybitty little payment that will be different let's talk about amortization tables or schedule an amortization schedule is just a list of all the payments that you make along with the balance at the end of that period and the principle and interest that are part of that there were three methods of constructing these and we're going to actually look at all three the first one we're going to do is by hand the second is using the builtin amortization table in the ba2 plus calculator and thirdly excel or another computer program spreadsheets are wonderful for this sort of thing so we're going to look at them all so let's start by doing one by hand and we are not going to do this whole thing because i for one do not have the patience at the beginning we owed a hundred thousand dollars we put that here under loan balance the interest that we paid on this was a thousand dollars i found that by remembering that i is 12 over 12 equals 0.01 so the interest of the first month is going to be the balance times i which is a thousand dollars so i take that thousand dollars let's work that out here i multiply that by .01 and it says that sorry it was a hundred thousand dollars times .01 and i owe an extra thousand dollars so now i owe a thousand a hundred and one thousand dollars i made payment of a thousand fifty three twenty three we already worked that out which means that a thousand of that was interest and 53 it was principal this plus this equals this my new balance is then a hundred thousand dollars minus the amount of principal i paid 53 dollars and 23 cents so now we owe 99 946.77 so i'm going to start off this row that way 99 how much interest do i owe on that well let's multiply it by 0.01 and it says i owe 999.46 i'm rounding here at every step normally a computer is going to do this and every bank has its own rounding procedure my payment is the same because we have even payments in an annuity i'm gonna write that all down all the same which means the principal well if i make this negative and then add my payment 1053.23 it looks like i actually paid off 53.76 leaving me with a new balance of minus and then let's add how much we owed nine nine nine four six point seven seven and that is now we owe nine nine eight nine three and one cent perfect that is our amortization table in order to find the balance of the loan after three periods i could continue on doing this by hand but that is tedious and frustrating so we're gonna move on to method number three and i'm gonna do the rest of this with excel using excel i haven't done anything too fancy here except copy over the exact same thing we had but now into excel so i'm going to make sure that i have the correct interest rate i have to convert this for xl so i'm going to say that if j12 is 12 then i is 0.01 we started with a hundred thousand dollars and we then that thousand was actually a hundred thousand times the interest rate for you guys who are excel aficionados pressing f4 here means that we've fixed that so that interest rate stays the same for the whole problem enter our payment that's fixed and our principal that's going to be well how much we paid minus the interest and our new balance is going to be that hundred thousand dollars minus the amount of principal we paid off here what i owe at the beginning of month two is what i owe at the end of month one so now i can fill down so i'm going to take all of these and fill them all the way down so that i'm filling out the entire thing at once one thing to be careful of is sometimes excel will fill incorrectly so i'm just going to make sure everything is working exactly according to plan once i do this you can see that here i've got the balance at the end of the third period so let's go back to our question and say that we have a balance of 99 838 and 71 cents let's do another method so here what we're going to do is use the amortization schedule on the calculator so above the present value is the amortization button so second amortization what i'm going to do is say let's look at the third row if i want to look at the third row i say from p1 equals 3 that means the beginning of the third row and i go 3 enter from to the end of the third row 3 and enter the balance is now everything else i'm going to read off the balance is 99838.71 the principal we've paid is negative 54299 that's 30 and the interest that we've paid is negative 998.93 when we add these things up together you'll see that they are exactly that 1053 and 23 cents negative because our payment is negative it's decreasing the balance that's the same thing that we got via excel well we've already done part d here the principal was 54 30 and the interest was 998.93 so now let's look at how much we paid in the first year again we're going to do two methods for this and i'm not going to do it by hand because that's a lot of work which seems a little silly so going back to here i'm going to sum everything the loan balance doesn't make sense to add but i'm going to go some bracket and then i highlight everything i've paid that's going to add all those numbers up together my payments well it looks like i've made 12 000 worth of payments how much principal have i paid off well all those add up together and now my new balance would be this 9938 so let's make everything her bold because that will look a lot nicer so if we look here you can see that at the end of year one then we have the balance is nine nine three two four point nine one that's the balance at the end of year one how much interest did we pay over the entire year we paid 11 963 of interest and we only paid off 675 dollars worth of principal that's what happens when we have a very high interest rate 12 percent so how much did we pay in the first year in the first year we made 12 payments of 1053 and 23 cents and we could see that in our excel so let's clear out of this menu 12 times 1053.23 we made 12 638.76 worth of payments so now let's look at our amortization schedule on the calculator so second amortization when i'm doing the entire first year that says from the beginning of the first month so let's change that to 1 to the end of the year the end of the 12th month p2 equals 12 that's one year well how much did we pay our balance that's part h was 99324.91 our interest was a lot again 11963.67 and the principal we paid off was 675 looking back at our excel you can see that this is exactly the same the principal paid 675.09 those are the same numbers balance 99324 91 same thing and when we go to the interest paid that's going to be 11963.67 so again we're getting the exact same answers no matter which method we use how much interest did we pay in the third year the easiest way to do this is the amortization table built into our calculator the third year starts in the 25th month and it ends in the 36th month that's because the second year ends at 24. so the next one starts and we say at the beginning so let's go up here so p1 must be 25 p2 is 36 that's three years so over those three years we paid less interest than we did in the first two years in the first year but we still paid 11 781.58 cents worth of interest finally let's find our last payment so what i mean by that is we have 299 payments that are exactly 1053 and 23 cents and we have one littler payment the more we round the more different that is there's a several different ways that we can find this i'm going to call this the harder method that's find the balance at the end of the 299th month add one month of interest this is actually not that bad if we do it in excel that's the harder method easier is to use our calculator so pretend we overpaid and use p2 equals 300. it is going to be much easier if i just show you let's go into our amortization and p1 it doesn't matter what p1 is because i'm only looking at the balance but let's say let's only look at that final month so p1 is 300 p2 is 300 that last month and now i'm going to look at it balance is negative 11.01 that means we overpaid by eleven dollars had we paid a thousand fifty three and twenty three cents we would have overpaid by this so we really should have paid well that regular payment minus 1101 let's do that so that's already negative so if i just say plus 1053.23 i should have paid 11 1042.22 let's do that again with excel because excel is actually a really good method so all i've done here in excel is instead of putting in that total i just copied it down one more month and then another month going to the end and we could hide all those rows which might be a smart thing to do at the end of the 299th month i owe a thousand dollars 31 1031 and 91 cents let's just pull these down a little bit more so i owe 10 and 32 cents worth of interest that means that i should only make a payment of 1031.91 plus 10.32 or 1042.22 pulling these down a little bit more you can see that now i owe no money at the end that's the same answer we got before alternatively if i just copied what i had before and this changed up to 1054 like that 1053 you can see that i would have overpaid by one cent either way this is the answer for the final payment let's end with a little bit more vocabulary because you'll see these if you start looking at mortgages or doing your own research a fixed rate mortgage is one where the interest rate stays the same for the entire term typically five years the opposite of that is called a variable rate mortgage in a variable rate mortgage the payment is fixed but interest varies according to the prime rate that's fixed by the bank of canada in general a fixed rate mortgage is very stable it's safe you know exactly what will happen at the end of the five years variable rate is risky if interest rates go up you could end up owing more in your mortgage but if interest rates go down well that will be better for you because you will owe less then we've got the vert closed versus open mortgages in a closed mortgage if you try to prepay or pay off your entire mortgage or change your payments there will be a penalty on that so even if you sell your house midterm there's a penalty in an open mortgage you can do whatever you'd like you could make extra payments sometimes you can make smaller payments if you need you can pay off the entire mortgage whenever you'd like typically because you have a lot more freedom in this mortgage you might have a higher interest rate finally i've said this before the down payment is not part of your mortgage it's the money that you pay right away i'm going to say that a very typical one is 20 it can be more or less in canada if you have at least a 20 down payment to not borrow that money then you don't have to pay what's called mortgage insurance where you're taking out an insurance policy on the mortgage and that goes to the cmhc that's a canadian institute 20 percent means less fees 15 you pay more fees lesson 17 mortgages and amortization part two we're going to jump right in with the problem but this time it's going to be a general annuity as canadian mortgages tend to be banks will apply the thirty percent rule no more than thirty percent of your gross income may be used for your mortgage payment if your gross income is three thousand three hundred thirty three dollars and thirty three cents you're looking for a fiveyear term on a 25year amortization and banks are charging j2 equals six percent find the maximum size of the payment and the maximum mortgage what this means is that the size of the mortgage you can get really depends on your income banks are going to evaluate several factors one of them is your income and one of them is your debt to credit ratio how much other debt you have and how much access to credit you have if your gross income is three hundred and thirty three dollars and thirty three cents per month and we can use thirty percent of that for a mortgage payment then our maximum mortgage payment is going to be a thousand dollars so that's the biggest mortgage payment we can afford if we end up having to pay two thousand dollars we wouldn't be able to afford it when we try to calculate our maximum mortgage we're going to use that as our payment let's fill in the rest of our annuity in a canadian mortgage we're typically looking at a general annuity cy tends to be 2 and py is 12 because we're paying a monthly our semiannual interest rate is six percent we're going to have this be a fiveyear term the 25year amortization when we're calculating that that's just going to be a 25 years because we're going to pay it off in 25 years in five years we're going to have to reevaluate and figure out what's going on we're going to try to figure out a present value here and our future value is always zero begin is off because any money we borrow or pay at the very beginning is part of the down payment so let's start with that 12 and cy is two notice when i enter that p y and cy are now different n is 300 our interest rate is six our payment is one thousand dollars making that negative and our future value is zero so when i compute the present value we can see that we can afford to borrow 156 297.23 which is a reasonable sized mortgage that's our maximum mortgage but if we have some cash to put towards a down payment we could buy a house that cost two hundred thousand if we had about forty four thousand dollars down payment so we'd have to put some money down but we can afford to borrow 156 thousand so let's say we got this size mortgage and i'm going to leave it as is but in reality would probably round that number to 23 cents so let's look at what happens at the end of this mortgage well we're not at the end of the mortgage right now we're at the end of the term let's say five years has gone by let's look to see what happens there's a few different methods method one is going to be to use the amortization and that's going to be my preferred way of doing things if we go into that second pv amortization and p1 is now going to be it's the end of the five years so p1 is one and the end of the five years p2 will be 60. so if i go down now my balance is 140 for 12 and 28 cents method number two well we could just set n equals 60 and compute the future value and that would be the exact same thing method three because we always have another method is to use excel let's look at this with excel you might recognize this as the same type of sheet that we looked at in lesson 16. this is an amortization table or an amortization schedule for our mortgage except excel does not deal with general annuities as well as our calculator does so i put in my semiannual rate and i converted it to effective using the effect command then i had to switch it to a j12 using the nominal command finally i divided it by 12 and that's the interest that i used you can see that one so i took my loan balance i found the interest i put in my payment is a constant principal again is just payment minus the interest and finally whatever i have is going to be what i started with minus the principal paid is our new balance in the next month i just pull my loan balance down from the previous month at the beginning this is exactly my amortization schedule and now i can look up any payment i want i've used a very interesting thing in excel where i've frozen the pane so if you'll notice i'm just scrolling down and i'm going to scroll down to month 60. at the end of the 60th month i have oh 140 412 dollars and 28 cents that's exactly what we got on the calculator which is helpful after five years the interest rate has increased to j2 equals eight percent what's the size of our new payment so what's happened here is five years have gone by five years have passed which means that i have 20 years left and my new present value is actually going to be well this number 144 12 28 cents don't worry so much about the decimal and rounding here if you're sticking with the same bank you don't have to do an intermediate rounding step but if you take your mortgage over to another bank you would what i'm going to do is take this and just press pv and now if we look over here recall present value is exactly what i want it to be that's going to be my new mortgage so all we have to do is fill out the exact same table we know that our present value is how much money we owe our interest rate has increased to j2 equals eight percent and we're still going to make monthly payments we have 20 years left so that's 240 payments we're going to try to find our payment at the end of those 20 years hopefully we have paid everything off again this is an ordinary annuity so let's look at this our pycy are the same as they should be but now we only have 240 months left but our interest rate is eight our future value is the same we've reset our let's make sure that future value is zero so let's compute our new payment our new payment is going to be 11 63 and 12 cents here we're going to assume that we're going to have to round up so i'm going to reenter that so let's put that in 11 63 2 oops let's make that our new payment and just to check i recompute the n and i get just under 240 that's what i was looking 1166 that is just wrong oops let's reenter that payment with the rounded amount 1163.12 and that's negative let's press payment there we go and recompute our n our n is now just under 240 which is what we want to be so we're going to always round up and reenter and now we know our new payments let's go ahead and update our excel sheet so our excel sheet now says this is 11 63 and 12 cents let's press enter and then let's just spread this down make sure that it stays the same sometimes excel starts to count upwards that's probably enough because we're only doing this for a year let's go back to that 60 years and now we can see that we're paying this differently of course i have to change my interest rate as well so let's just stop doing this in excel let's do it again five years later the interest rate stays the same but we can actually afford an extra 12 000 on the mortgage assuming we will amortize the balance over the remaining 15 years what is the payment so what i'm going to do is put in an extra payment so we're going to use the amortization again and figure out what happens after five years one thing to remember the calculator doesn't remember the first five years those have been wiped out it thinks it's a 20year notebook so p1 equals 1 and p2 equals 60. so we're doing exactly what we did in the last step except now our balance is less 122 671.40 but we're also going to pay some money that's an extra 12 000 that we can afford to pay so if we can afford to pay an extra twelve thousand now it's only a hundred and ten thousand i'm going to go ahead and make that the present value so now i'm looking at a 15 year mortgage that starts at a hundred and ten thousand our payment is what we're going to be computing but again we're going to pay it off and it's always an ordinary annuity i'm making monthly payments it's compounded semiannually and our interest rate stays at eight that many years sorry months 15 times 12 is going to be 180 months so let's go ahead and work that out second py is 12 and 2 that stays the same let's change our n to 180 our present value i've already changed our iy stays the same and so all i have to do is compute the payment which is now 1049 and 34 cents because remember we're rounding up and i'm going to go ahead there and reenter negative payment and now i recompute the n and it's just under 180 which is exactly what i want to do let's look at this mortgage as a timeline so if i have six percent and then eight percent what i have is a 25year amortization broken up into fiveyear terms originally how much did i borrow i borrowed 156 297 and i like to treat that as arrow in because that was money that i was getting from the bank my payments come out of my accounts and there are payments of a thousand i make about 60 of those exactly 60 of those with the last one coming out at year five at that point my balance or how much i owe is around 140 000. then i start making more payments i've raised my payments because the interest rate has gotten higher so i make a bunch of payments of 1163 and 12 cents and my last one comes out exactly at the 12 10 year anniversary of my mortgage at this point i'm gonna make one extra special at the same time deposit of twelve thousand dollars comes out of my account it goes on to my mortgage so my balance goes for to 110 671 after i make that 12 thousand dollar payment now i'm going to make some more payments so i keep on going and now i'm going to go all the way to the end because uh five of these is a lot and each of these payments is going to be 1049 and 34 cents so when i made that extra prepayment against the principal which i'm usually allowed to do at the anniversary date or when i renew my mortgage it reduced my payments so that's how much i did now let's figure out what the interest was on this mortgage okay well the interest was money paid minus money borrowed and i'm going to uh let's ignore the fact that that last month is a little bit tinier what we paid is going to be 60 payments of a thousand dollars plus 60 payments of 11 63 and 12 cents plus 180 payments of 1049 and 34 cents plus 12 000 and that's really going to be 179 plus one extra one but we're not going to worry about that tiny little extra how much did we borrow where original borrowing was a hundred and fifty six thousand two hundred ninety seven dollars and twenty three cents so in the end we paid a hundred and seventy four thousand three hundred seventy one dollars and seventeen cents in interest that's a lot but borrowing is expensive let's go back to part d we made that twelve thousand dollar prepayment and we used that money in order to lower our payments but what if we could afford the payment that we used to be paying that is we can afford to still pay 1163 and 12 cents that's how much we were used to it still fits into our budget our present value if you remember let's go back to recall present value remember at that time we owed 110 671 on our mortgage interest rate was eight percent and we're making monthly payments and compounding semiannually if i change my payment to 1163.12 a higher payment than i need i should be able to pay off my mortgage faster so let's compute the payment so compute payment that is not what i meant to do compute future compute n is what we're looking for so our new n is 149.64 months so 149 full months and then one small payment if i divide that by 12 we find out that's about 12 and a half years so we can save two and a half years pay it off faster and in the end we're going to be paying less of a mortgage if we do this example three let's do the exact same thing again this time your gross income is five thousand dollars per month that's your income before taxes the rate is now j2 equals eight percent let's write that in as we go and we're looking for a threeyear term and a 20year amortization 20 years and everything is monthly that means we have 240 months on our mortgage we can afford as our maximum payment well thirty percent of that five thousand dollars so let's multiply that by thirty percent and now we know we can afford fifteen hundred dollars and you can do this on a calculator so i'm gonna go ahead and write in that my payment is fifteen hundred dollars we're always going to pay it off and complete always an ordinary annuity and here because it doesn't say we're doing monthly payments let's compute our p y and cy stay the same through this whole lesson so i don't have to worry about that but i do have to reset n i y present value let's skip payment is 1500 and the future value is zero so when i compute my present value it turns out i can afford or you can afford 181 000 and 20 181 000 81 and 24 cents that's the size of our mortgage after three years you renew your mortgage at the same rate but are able to make a ten thousand dollar payment like we did last time we're going to run through two scenarios first we're just going to assume that we're going to amortize over the remaining 17 years this means our payments will decrease freeing up cash flow for other things our other option which we'll do next is keep our payments the same and then our time will decrease both of which are all right so let's see how much money we owe after three years we owe well that's going to be p2 equals 36. so p1 is 1 p2 is 36 or 3 years well we owe and sixty eight thousand dollars and forty cents so at the end of three years we owe 168 000 we're going to make a 10 000 payment so i'm going to take that number i just pressed clear one time to make it just the number itself i'm going to subtract 10 000 and that is going to be my new present value so let's write that in 158 441 and 40 cents i'm going to recompute my payment everything else stays the same except for my n because i have 17 times 12 is 204 payments left so let's change that n to 204 and recompute the payment and i get 14 10.95 because i'm rounding that up now let's say we wanted to keep our payments the same we know we can afford fifteen hundred dollars even though we owe 158 441 we have a lower balance and we could get away with a lower payment but we don't want to everything's going to stay the same except for the n which i'm now going to recompute monthly payments seminal compounding etc etc so let's make our payment back to 1500 which is higher than the 1410 that we needed now when i compute n i get n is smaller 180 it's a little over 15 years 15 years it's 15 years and a tiny little bit so we've now saved two years off of our mortgage we've also saved interest i'm not going to go through and compute the exact number of interest here i'm going to do that in excel instead i've gone ahead and made this into an excel sheet we started with a hundred and eighty one thousand eighty one dollars and twenty four cents then we paid fifteen hundred dollars a month eight percent interest if we scroll down note that i made one very large payment of ten thousand eleven thousand five hundred dollars instead of fifteen hundred an extra ten thousand dollars at the end of that month the third year 36 months we owed 158 441 dollars and 40 cents the next month over in column a here the lower payments i lowered my payment to 14 10.95 here i left my payments the same notice that my balance is shrinking faster on this side let's zoom down all those months until the 218th month that's about 18 years where i make one smaller payment of 780 for the last one i just added the interest to the balance owing and that is 218. going down over here we pay for two more years and my this one is only about 70 cents less than the other ones and in the end we've paid 170 751 dollars in interest over here with lower payments but we've only paid 153 000 over here so our difference is almost twenty thousand dollars worth of interest in that case it does make more sense to keep a higher payment
