00:01 - so what is binary number system
00:03 - and why is it so famous
00:06 - long ago when civilization probably
started
00:09 - we humans
00:10 - discovered a number system
00:12 - that would have
00:13 - exactly ten digits and this number
system
00:16 - was called decimal number system
00:18 - and the digits in this number system
would be
00:21 - zero one two three four five six seven
00:24 - eight and nine
00:26 - not so long ago
00:28 - another number system became famous
00:30 - at the language of computers
00:33 - and this was called
00:34 - the binary number system
00:36 - a binary number system
00:38 - would have only two digits zero and one
00:42 - if a number system has n digits we
say that
00:46 - the base of the number system is n so
decimal number system can also be called
00:50 - base ten number system
00:52 - and similarly
00:53 - binary number system can also be called
base two number system
00:58 - now why does a computer
01:00 - understands binary
01:02 - and the simplest
01:03 - explanation can be
01:06 - that a computer is an electrical device
01:08 - and all electrical device
understands
01:11 - is electrical signals
01:14 - so say for example if we have an input wire to this machine
01:17 - there are only states possible for this wire
01:20 - either current is flowing through this wire
or current is not flowing through this
01:23 - wire
01:24 - if current is flowing through this wire we say
01:26 - that the state of this wire this input
is signaled
01:30 - and we say that a signal state
01:32 - corresponds to one
01:34 - and if current is not flowing this is not signaled then we say that not signal state
01:38 - corresponds to a zero
01:40 - so a zero
01:41 - or one
01:42 - invited the actually translates to
01:45 - a signal or non signal state in an
electrical device
01:49 - and we can have multiple wires or multiple inputs
01:53 - to represent multiple ones and zeros
01:56 - now let us quickly see how we write a number
01:59 - these two number system
02:01 - if we write a number in decimal
number system
02:04 - and if we go back to our
02:06 - elementary school mathematics then
02:08 - we write number in one row and multiple columns
02:11 - the right most column corresponding to
the right most digit
02:15 - is called the ones place
02:17 - second right column is called the tens place
02:19 - and we go on increasing in multiple
of tens like hundreds place and
02:23 - thosounds place
02:24 - and so on
02:26 - if we have to the represent this
02:28 - in powers of ten then
02:29 - the right most place or the least significant
02:32 - digit
02:33 - corresponds to the ten to the power zero
02:36 - and go on like ten to the power one ten to the power two ten to the power three and so on
02:40 - and as we go on
02:43 - towards left we go on increasing in power of tens
02:46 - say for example if we write a number one twenty five in decimal number system
02:50 - we say that this number has got
02:52 - five ones
02:54 - two tens
02:56 - and one hundred
02:57 - we could also say that this number has got five ten to the power zeros
03:01 - two ten to the power one and one ten to the power two
03:04 - and this sums up
03:06 - to one twenty five
03:08 - now when we write a number in binary number system
03:12 - the only digits possible
03:14 - are zero and one
03:16 - the right most column
03:17 - corresponds to the ones position
03:19 - second right column corresponds to 
03:21 - twos position and we go on
03:23 - increasing
03:25 - in powers of two like fours position eights position
03:29 - and so on
03:30 - and if we have to write the same thing in
powers of twos
03:33 - this corresponds to two to the power zero
03:35 - two to the power one
03:37 - and so on
03:38 - and similarly we can go on we can
03:41 - keep going towards left
03:43 - in powers of two
03:44 - now let us write a number in binary
03:47 - so let's say we become a number one one
03:49 - one one
03:51 - one zero one
03:52 - so we say that this is got
03:54 - one one
03:58 - zero twos
04:04 - one four and we could also say that this is got
04:05 - one two the power zero
04:07 - zero to the power one
04:09 - and one two the power two
04:11 - and we can go on
04:13 - so to find out the place value of a digit
04:16 - in binary number system we multiply the digit one or zero by the
04:20 - corresponding power of two
04:22 - so if to pick up the seventh column from
left
04:25 - so the place value here is calculated by multiplying the number one
04:28 - with two the power six
04:30 - so we get this
04:32 - so if we want to convert
04:34 - a number from binary to decimal number
system it is pretty straightforward
04:38 - well you need to do is
04:40 - pick up all these
04:41 - place values and sum of them up
04:44 - and if you try to sum this up this comes as
04:47 - hundred and twenty five
04:50 - so one one one one
04:52 - one zero one
04:53 - in binary
04:54 - is actually
04:55 - number one twenty five in decimal number system
04:59 - so we say practice number one one one
one
05:02 - one zero one
05:04 - in base two
05:05 - is actually hundred and twenty five
05:09 - in base ten
05:12 - now in this lesson we did not describe
05:15 - how we got this number
05:16 - one one one one one zero one
05:19 - in binary
05:20 - for one twenty five
05:21 - we will do it in the next lesson
05:23 - so in the next lesson we will show you
how to convert
05:26 - a number
05:27 - from decimal number system
05:28 - to binary number system
05:30 - so thanks for watching
