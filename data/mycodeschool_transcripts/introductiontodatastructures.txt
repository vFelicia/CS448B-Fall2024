00:00 - In this lesson and in this series of lessons, we will
00:04 - introduce you to the concept of data
structures.
00:07 - Data structure is the most fundamental
00:10 - and building block concept in computer
science
00:13 - and good knowledge of data structures is
a must
00:16 - to design and develop
00:18 - efficient software systems.
00:21 - Ok, so let's get started
00:23 - we deal with data all the time
00:25 - and how we store,
00:27 - organize and group our data together
00:30 - matters.
00:32 - Let's pick up some examples from our day to day life
00:35 - where organizing data in a particular structure helps us.
00:38 - We are able to search a word quickly and efficiently  in a language
00:43 - dictionary
00:44 - because the
00:45 - words in the dictionary are sorted.
00:48 - What if the words in the dictionary
were not sorted?
00:51 - It would be impractical and impossible
00:53 - to search for a word among millions of
words.
00:56 - So, dictionary is organized
00:58 - as a sorted list of words.
01:01 - Let's pick up another example.
01:04 - If we have something like a city map,
01:06 - the data, like position of the landmark
and
01:09 - road network connections, all this data is
01:12 - organized in the form of geometries. We
01:15 - show the map data in the form of
these geometries on a two-dimensional plane.
01:20 - So, map data needs to be structured
01:22 - like this so that we have scales and
directions and we are effectively able
01:26 - to search for a landmark and
01:28 - and get route from one place to
another
01:30 - and i will pick one more example
01:32 - for something like
01:33 - uh... daily cash in and cash out
statement
01:37 - of a business what we also call
01:39 - a cash book in accounts, it makes
most sense to organize and store the
01:43 - data in the form of a tabular schema
01:45 - it is very easy to aggregate data and extract information, if the data is
01:50 - organized in these columns,
01:52 - in these tables
01:53 - so different kind of structures are
needed
01:55 - to organize different kind of data
01:57 - now computers work with all kind of data
02:00 - computers work with
02:02 - texts, images, videos
02:04 - relational data geospatial data and
pretty much any kind of data that we
02:09 - have on this planet
02:10 - how we store organize and group
02:13 - data in computers matters
because
02:17 - computers deal with really really large data
even with the computational power of
02:20 - machines if
02:22 - we do not use the right kind of structures
02:24 - the right kind of logical structures
02:26 - then our software systems will not be
efficient
02:31 - Formal definition of data structure would be that -
02:35 - a data structures is a way
02:37 - to store and organize data
02:40 - in a computer so that
02:43 - the data can be used efficiently
02:46 - when we study data structures as ways
to store and organize data
02:51 - we study them in two ways
02:53 - so i'll say that we talk about data
structures as
02:57 - one we talk about them as mathematical
and logical models. when we talk about
03:02 - them as mathematical and logical models we
just look at an abstract view of them
03:07 - we just look at from a high level
what all features and what all
03:10 - operations define that particular data
structure
03:13 - example of uh... abstract view from
real-world can be something like
03:18 - the abstract view of a device named
television can be that
03:21 - it is an electrical device that can be
turned on and off
03:25 - it can receive signals
03:27 - for satellite programs and
03:29 - the audio video
03:31 - of the program and as long as i have
03:34 - a device like this i do not bother
how circuits are embedded to create this
03:38 - device or which company makes this
device
03:41 - so this is an abstract view
03:44 - so when we study data structures
as mathematical or logical models
03:48 - we just define their abstract view or
in other words
03:51 - we have a term for this we define them as
03:54 - abstract data types
03:57 - an example of
03:58 - abstract data type
03:59 - can be
04:00 - i want to define something called a
list
04:04 - that should be able to
04:05 - store a group of elements of a
particular datatype and we should be
04:09 - able to read
04:10 - the elements
04:12 - by their position in the list
04:14 - and we should be also able to
04:16 - modify element at a particular
position in the list
04:19 - i would say store a given number of
elements of any datatype
04:22 - so we are just defining a model now can
implement this
04:26 - uh... in a programming language in a
number of ways
04:29 - so this is uh... definition of
04:31 - an abstract data type we will also call
04:33 - abstract data type as adt
04:37 - if you see
04:38 - all the high level languages
already have a concrete implementation
04:41 - of such an adt
04:43 - in the form of arrays
04:45 - so arrays give us
04:46 - all these functionalities so arrays are data types which are concrete
04:49 - implementation
04:51 - so the second way of talking about data
structures is
04:54 - talking about that implementation
04:57 - so implementations would be some
concrete types and not an abstract data
05:01 - type
05:02 - we can implement the same adt
05:04 - in multiple ways in the same language
05:06 - for example in c or c++ we can
implement this list adt
05:11 - as a data structure named
05:12 - linked list
05:14 - and if you have not heard about it we
will be talking about them a lot
05:17 - we will be talking about linked list a lot
in the coming lessons
05:21 - okay, so lets define an abstract data type formally because this is one term
05:25 - that
05:26 - we will encounter quite often
05:28 - abstract data types are entities that
are definitions of data and operation
05:33 - but do not have
05:35 - implementations so they do not have any
implementation details
05:39 - we will be talking about a lot of data
structures in this course
05:42 - we will be talking about
05:44 - them as abstract data types and we will
also be looking at how to implement them
05:48 - some of the data structures that we will talk about
05:52 - are arrays linked list
05:54 - stack,
05:56 - queue,
05:57 - tree, graph and the list goes on
06:00 - there are many more to study
06:03 - so when we will study these data structures
we will study their logical view
06:08 - we will study what operations are available
to us with these data structures
06:13 - we will study the cost of these operations
06:15 - mostly in terms of time
06:18 - and then definitely we will study
06:20 - the implementation
06:22 - in a programming language
06:24 - so we will be studying all these data
structures in the coming lessons
06:28 - and this is all for this introductory
lesson thanks for watching
