00:00 - in our previous lesson we wrote and
executed our first 'C' program.
00:04 - We printed hello world on screen .We used gcc compiler which runs from command
00:10 - line to compile our program
00:11 - now in this lesson we will see how we
can use
00:15 - compiler that we call integrated
00:18 - development environments or IDEs
00:21 - to write compile and
00:24 - execute our program. IDEs give you
00:28 - a rich editor, a nice user interface
00:31 - and a bunch of features that help you
manage big projects
00:34 - and detect errors in your program. Some of
the IDEs that you can use for C are
00:40 - DEV-CPP, this is a
00:43 - light one. There is another one named
Code Blocks
00:48 - Visual Studio Express edition. This one
is by Microsoft and this is what
00:53 - I will use in most of the lessons in this
series
00:57 - there is another one named Eclipse for
C/ C++
01:01 - typically an IDE would support both
C and C plus plus
01:05 - I D E and compiler, you can use these terms
for each other
01:09 - that's what we do practically. There is
one more thing that I want to point out
01:14 - it's good if your compiler follows the
latest
01:17 - standards for C language. There are some
compilers that are
01:21 - too outdated like Turbo C
01:24 - I would not recommend using this.
You can use any among the rest.
01:29 - I will come back to showing how you can
use some of these IDEs
01:34 - but first I'll open the program that we
had written in our previous lesson
01:38 - A compiler takes a C source file, a compiler
01:41 - for C will take a C source file and create
01:44 - an executable file. if there is a
syntactical
01:48 - error in your program , compilation fails
01:51 - compiler gives  you error messages
that we call compilation errors.
01:56 - compilation errors should help you fix
your program
01:59 - for example it's a rule that every
statement in C must end with a semicolon
02:05 - let's remove this semicolon from here and
now lets compile this file using gcc
02:11 - to compile we would give gcc space the
02:15 - C source file name, Now as you can see I am getting some error message here.
02:19 - It's saying that in function
02:20 - int main(),  at line 6, a semi-colon is
expected.
02:25 - if I would fix this error put a
semicolon at the end of this printf
02:29 - statement
02:30 - save the file and then
02:33 - compile again there is no error. If
there would be a compilation
02:37 - error no fresh executable file will be
created
02:41 - if compilation passes, an executable file
named
02:45 - a.exe will be created afresh.
02:49 - you can run this executable file from
command line
02:52 - if you would like to give your executable file
a name of your choice
02:56 - in gcc, while using gcc, what you can do is
you can type in gcc source file name
03:02 - space
03:03 - minus O and then you type in
03:07 - the name that you want for executable.
For example let's say I want
03:11 - HelloWorld.exe, then I'll just say HelloWorld
03:14 - With this and executable file named HelloWorld.exe is created
03:19 - you can check it from command line also, type in
03:22 - DIR to list all the files in the
directory and now you can run
03:27 - HelloWorld.exe
03:30 - please note that I am wanna bindles
machine things will be pretty similar
03:34 - on a Linux machine you would not have a
fight he
03:37 - with extension expe you would have a
fight with extension
03:41 - out so you can create something like
Hello void
03:45 - doc out now the even see how we can come
by I'll and execute
03:49 - our program in some of these ID ease the
village secured the scene program to
03:54 - print hello world
03:55 - I have opened up Dave CPP on what feels
like I def c plus plus compiler
04:00 - I would recommend watching this part of
to be due in full screen for
04:03 - Becca Plata de now the first thing that
we need to do is
04:07 - we need to create a/c source file and
this time
04:10 - we do not need to use an external editor
like Notepad
04:14 - go to File in the menu at the top here
then new
04:18 - and click on source file you also have
pushed a keyboard shortcut for this
04:23 - and it'll open and editor for you in the
ided itself where you can type in your
04:28 - court
04:28 - and read the same program to print hello
world on screen
04:32 - this time they're getting these nice
color courts
04:36 - as you can see these keywords: in Denver
tonight in Boyd this forced languages
04:42 - celebrity defense
04:43 - is in some other color the skull of
course
04:46 - improve third ability of your program
now the next thing that we need to do is
04:50 - need to save dis source file to see if
he did press control plus
04:55 - S key gonna go to File antique on Save
or Save As
04:59 - this dialogue will open into struck down
save this tape
05:03 - select see source file and then give a
name for the source file and give named
05:08 - Dave CPP hello
05:10 - once I click on save my C++ source file
is created
05:14 - now I can come by on my program to
comply
05:17 - go to execute in the menu at the top
here
05:21 - and click on compile you also have a
keyboard shortcut control
05:25 - plus f9 key for this when you were taken
compiled this
05:29 - pop-up will come and if everything is
alright and executed will be created in
05:34 - the scene for reader
05:35 - where you would have saved your source
file the name of the executable will be
05:39 - seen as the name of the source fired so
if my
05:41 - source file is Dave CPP hello dart see
my executable is
05:45 - Dave CPP hello doc expe
05:48 - as fear teen million weekend double
click this executed by then try to run
05:53 - the program
05:54 - but something will flash and gore made
the machine will start and finish the
05:59 - execution of program in no time
06:01 - if you want to see the output you can
run the executable from command line
06:05 - go to the folder where they execute a
bill is from the command line
06:08 - and type in the name of the executable
file so this may be able to see the
06:13 - output
06:14 - die idee also gives you option to fund
the program
06:17 - you can go to execute and second run
there is a
06:21 - keyboard checkered control plus f10 for
this bike
06:24 - this is same as double clicking the
executable file something will flash and
06:28 - go away quickly
06:29 - the program the start and finish its
execution
06:33 - in no time before you can see the output
to see the output of program by double
06:38 - clicking on the executors Bernard by
using
06:40 - this an option in the menu here we can
put
06:43 - hacked in our program so what I'm going
to do here it is
06:47 - am first going to right are comment in
06:50 - my program if you would write the line
in your program
06:54 - starting with two forward slashes
backline
06:57 - is a comment in your program it will be
ignored by the compiler
07:01 - when compiling it will not be considered
a valid see statement
07:05 - it will not be considered a/c statement
to be executed
07:09 - and now I'll draped to see statements
07:12 - these two statements you're saying that
the program
07:15 - must de Cannes integer as input from the
user
07:19 - so when you would run the program the
program bill wait for you to enter an
07:23 - integer
07:24 - let's compile and run discord and see
what happens
07:27 - compilation a successful and now i cant
run
07:30 - as you can see this console display has
come here
07:34 - earlier it would come and go in no time
now because it's waiting for you to
07:39 - input some integer
07:40 - it's there and you can see hello world
on screen
07:44 - if I would press any key on the keyboard
now and press
07:48 - enter the console Rico a mi
07:52 - some ladies automatically paused
execution of your program
07:55 - in the end and show you the output so
you do not have to put
07:59 - a hack like this Dave c plus plus
doesn't do that
08:03 - and always remember that this is a hack
different people put different kind of
08:07 - hacks
08:08 - some people use a function named gets
%eh which is sparked off on your doc
08:12 - it's like Betty this function gets %eh
will make your program feet
08:17 - I did you pass some key but call your
doc it is not
08:20 - a standard celebrity it will not be
supported by many come by a nurse
08:24 - so it is not clear commended if you
would have some
08:28 - editing your program then upon combining
you would get the editor
08:31 - and I D E let's remove the semi-colon
here and try to combine the program and
08:36 - see what happens
08:37 - it would be this month for you to see it
saying they act at line 5 there we have
08:41 - it done statement
08:43 - dead is a syntex better before this line
08:46 - as a Newbie as a big a nerd in
programming accomplish in it and would
08:50 - often scare you
08:51 - it's important that you read the entire
message carefully and try to
08:55 - see a program and fixed our completion
at Ash
08:58 - if I would produce come arsenic on here
is my program would combine successfully
09:02 - than it would go away
09:04 - So Def CPB is fine after I D E stacked
you can use
09:09 - if you would use other eighties things
will be almost similar
09:12 - I have opened up another ninety you
named cord blocks
09:16 - things are similar hand go to File new
09:20 - and click on empty fine this time before
writing court I would first to see if
09:24 - the file
09:25 - child Press control s the style love
will come Save as type as selected
09:30 - CC plus plus fines and then I'll give a
name
09:34 - court blocks hello doxie
09:38 - 1 seconds here I can take my program
09:41 - not to compile I can go to be in the
menu at the top here
09:46 - and I can click on BB and come by Liza
09:49 - synonyms may use these two tones for
each other
09:53 - if you build a successful nor message
will come you can run the program
09:57 - you can also used option base and run it
we do both
10:00 - in one take side took one bed and run
now cord block
10:05 - all service causes the console for you
to see the output
10:08 - and once you learn press any key Denali
10:11 - the console exit as you can see it's
printing some extra messages apart from
10:15 - what you have continued called
10:18 - this definitely is better because fear
not having to put the hack
10:22 - so I have shown you how they can work
with two of 2i
10:25 - the East things will be almost similar
if you would use any other baby
10:30 - some web-sites including arson give you
this feature
10:33 - that you can't write compile and view
the output of your program
10:37 - in their browser itself so you do not
have to install anything on your local
10:41 - machine
10:43 - links to all of these resources to i'm
talking about. can be found in the
10:47 - description of this video
10:49 - from Nixle SNB will start getting deeper
into C language concepts
10:54 - this is it for this lesson thanks for
watching
