00:00 - hello everyone in this video i'm going
00:02 - to show you how we can install and
00:04 - configure
00:05 - gcc compiler for windows
00:09 - the first thing that you need to do is
00:10 - you need to open google and type in the
00:12 - query min
00:14 - gw the first link will be
00:17 - to site
00:18 - mingw.org click on this link open this
00:21 - site mingw is for minimalistic gnu for
00:25 - windows on this site you need to look
00:28 - for a link to download installer there
00:30 - is a link in the right
00:33 - once you have downloaded the installer
00:35 - you can run it
00:42 - just make a note of the installation
00:44 - directory
00:46 - you would also get this option to select
00:49 - what all compilers you want to install
00:51 - typically you would like to install both
00:54 - c and c plus plus compiler
00:57 - so click on install the installation
00:59 - will complete
01:00 - once the installation of mingw is
01:03 - finished
01:04 - open the directory where you have
01:06 - installed mingw
01:09 - for me it is installed in c min gw
01:12 - go to bin folder in the installation
01:14 - directory
01:15 - then copy this path copy this directory
01:18 - path
01:20 - now go to start menu in your computer
01:22 - and click on properties of
01:24 - computer go to advanced system settings
01:28 - and now click on environment variables

01:42 - this dialog would open
01:43 - in variable value go to the end of the
01:46 - string press end key on your keyboard
01:49 - put a semicolon
01:51 - and paste the path of the bin directory
01:55 - which is c
01:57 - mingw bin for me
02:01 - now click on ok
02:04 - and close all of this
02:07 - press windows plus r key to open this
02:10 - dialog type in cmd
02:14 - command prompt will open for you type in
02:16 - gcc
02:17 - if you get something like gcc command is
02:20 - not recognized then gcc is not correctly
02:23 - configured if you are getting something
02:24 - like gcc error no input files then gcc
02:29 - is configured for you
02:30 - type in gcc minus minus version
02:35 - and you should be able to get something
02:37 - like this it will tell you the version
02:38 - of gcc
02:40 - and if you would have chosen to install
02:43 - c plus plus compiler also
02:45 - while installing mingw then g plus plus
02:49 - is the c plus plus compiler and that
02:52 - will also be installed for you type in g
02:54 - plus plus space minus minus version
02:57 - and you should get something like this
03:00 - so this is how you install and configure
03:02 - gcc or g plus plus on a windows machine
03:06 - thanks for watching
