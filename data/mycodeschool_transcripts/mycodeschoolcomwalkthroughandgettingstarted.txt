00:00 - hello everyone welcome to my code school
00:02 - now you can watch all our YouTube videos
00:05 - practice a lot of programming problems
00:07 - and connect with mentors on my code
00:10 - school calm and I'm going to walk you
00:13 - through my code school calm and show you
00:15 - how you can do all of this once you sign
00:18 - up and log into the website you will
00:20 - reach this page where you will have
00:22 - these objects called workouts a workout

00:45 - can go to the next step next step in the
00:48 - workout is a practice problem you need
00:50 - to write a program to convert a number
00:52 - from binary to decimal you can write
00:55 - your program in the code editor here in
00:57 - the left you can choose one of the
00:59 - available languages to write your
01:01 - program and then you can run tests
01:04 - against your program and verify its
01:06 - correctness but before you write your
01:09 - program you must read the problem
01:11 - statement carefully your program must
01:13 - take input in a format described in the
01:17 - problem statement and then your program
01:19 - must print the output exactly in a
01:23 - format described in the problem
01:25 - statement I have written this program as
01:27 - per the input and output specification
01:30 - given in the problem statement now I can
01:32 - click on this run tests button the
01:34 - system will judge my solution and tell
01:36 - me whether it's correct or not it will
01:38 - also tell me the input expected output
01:42 - and received output you get a correct
01:45 - answer only when expected output and
01:47 - your output is exactly same if you are
01:51 - stuck somewhere and cannot figure out
01:53 - the logic or the system itself you can
