With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video we're gonna see how to
00:02 - deploy an application that we built into
00:05 - a docker image so after you package your
00:08 - application in a docker image and save
00:10 - it in the private repository you need to
00:12 - somehow deploy it on a development
00:15 - server or integration server or whatever
00:17 - other environment in this specific video
00:20 - we are using a docker registry of
00:23 - Amazon Web Services called ECR that's
00:26 - where we have pushed our own application
00:30 - docker image and we're gonna use docker
00:32 - compose to deploy that application this
00:35 - video is part of a docker tutorial
00:37 - series so if you want to actually follow
00:40 - through the whole process of developing
00:43 - an application packaging it into a
00:45 - docker image pushing it into a private
00:47 - repository and then finally deploying it
00:50 - on a application server here's a link to
00:52 - the video series so you can check that
00:54 - out so again back to our initial
01:00 - overview we have gone through all these
01:03 - individual steps so we built an image
01:06 - just like a Jenkins server would do and
01:10 - we pushed it into a repository so now
01:13 - let's actually simulate a development
01:15 - environment so let's imagine we have
01:18 - logged into a development server and we
01:23 - want to run our image that we just
01:27 - pushed the repository so our my app
01:29 - image and the MongoDB image both the
01:33 - database in the Express on the
01:36 - development server so the my app image
01:39 - will be pulled from private repository
01:41 - of EWS the in the to containers
01:45 - will be pulled from the docker hub so
01:48 - let's see actually how that would work
01:50 - so usually again you have developed your
01:54 - application you're done with it and you
01:57 - have created your own docker image right
02:02 - now in order to start an application on
02:06 - development server you would need all
02:07 - the containers that make up that
02:10 - application environment okay so we have
02:12 - a longer
02:13 -  Express already so what we are
02:15 - going to do is here we're gonna add a
02:19 - new container in the list which is gonna
02:25 - be our own image so let's go ahead and
02:28 - copy the image from our repository so
02:34 - let's actually use the 1.0 so again
02:43 - remember we said that this image name is
02:47 - a shortcut for having a docker dot IO
02:50 - dot library slash with like a
02:57 - specific version so instead of that
02:59 - because we are pulling these images from
03:02 - a docker hub we can actually skip that
03:06 - repository domain in front of the images
03:09 - but here because we're pulling it from a
03:12 - private repository so if we were to
03:15 - specify our image like this docker will
03:18 - think that our image resides on docker
03:20 - hub so we try to pull it from docker hub
03:22 - and of course it won't find it because
03:24 - we have to tell docker go and look at
03:27 - this repository with this repository
03:29 - name in this tag and of course in order
03:32 - to be able to pull this image or the
03:35 - docker composed to be able to pull this
03:36 - image the environment where you're
03:39 - executing this docker compose file has
03:42 - to be logged into a docker repository so
03:45 - here as the development server has to
03:48 - pull the image from the repository what
03:51 - we would need to do on the development
03:53 - server is actually do a docker login
03:55 - before we execute the docker compose and
03:58 - obviously you don't need a doctor login
04:00 - for doc hub those images will be
04:04 - pulled freely ok so the next thing that
04:08 - we have to configure are the ports
04:11 - because obviously want to open the ports
04:14 - if we go back we see that our
04:18 - application runs on port 3000 so the
04:21 - port of the container or that where the
04:24 - container is listening
04:26 - on is 3000 and here we can open the port
04:29 - on the host machine so it's going to be
04:33 - 3000 map to 3000 we have actually the
04:37 - environment variables inside of the
04:39 - docker file but obviously we could have
04:43 - configured them in the docker compose
04:46 - just like this so it's an alternative so
04:50 - this will be a complete docker compose
04:51 - file that will be used on a development
04:54 - server to deploy all the all the
04:58 - applications inside
05:00 - so again if we're trying to simulate a
05:02 - development server that the first step
05:03 - will be to dock to the docker login in
05:06 - this case you have this on command for
05:10 - logging in to the AWS repository which I
05:14 - have done already in this terminal so
05:18 - the next step is to have the docker
05:19 - compose file available on this
05:21 - development server because we have to
05:24 - execute the docker compose file because
05:27 - we're simulating here the way I would do
05:30 - it is I'm gonna create an demo
05:32 - file in the current directory where I am
05:36 - I'm gonna copy this and save so now I
05:43 - have my ml file and now we can
05:47 - start all three containers using munger
05:50 - docker compose comment - eff up and here
06:03 - we see that app started on 3000 and
06:07 - MongoDB and Express started as well so
06:14 - let's check again now and here we saw
06:19 - that database is lost every time we
06:24 - recreate a container and of course
06:27 - that's not good and we're going to learn
06:28 - how to preserve the database data
06:31 - between the container restarts using
06:33 - docker volumes in the later tutorials
06:36 - because this is not an ideal
06:39 - State okay so now that we have database
06:41 - in a collection let's actually refresh
06:43 - in our application works as well
06:46 - let's check awesome so our application
06:57 - works let's refresh this one as well and
07:00 - there is actually one thing that I
07:02 - needed to change in the code to connect
07:05 - no J's with MongoDB so let's actually go
07:09 - and look at that so this is my these are
07:13 - my handlers you know no J's where I
07:15 - connect to the MongoDB database so the
07:17 - your eyes are the same and what I
07:20 - changed here is that it was a localhost
07:22 - before so instead of localhost I changed
07:26 - it to MongoDB because this actually is a
07:30 - name of the container or of the service
07:34 - that we specify here so this actually
07:40 - leads back to the doctor Network and how
07:42 - docker compose takes care of it is that
07:44 - in the URI or when I connect one
07:48 - application in a docker container with
07:50 - another one in an other docker container
07:52 - I don't have to use this localhost
07:56 - anymore actually I wouldn't even need to
07:59 - use the port even because I have all
08:02 - that information so the host name and
08:04 - the port number in that configuration so
08:09 - my application will be able to connect
08:11 - to MongoDB using the service name and
08:14 - because of that you don't have to
08:16 - specify here a localhost and the port
08:18 - number which is actually even more
08:21 - advantage when you consider using docker
08:24 - containers to run all of your
08:26 - applications
08:27 - because it makes the connectivity
08:29 - between them even more easier
08:33 - and that actually concludes the this
08:37 - diagram that we saw previously we have
08:40 - gone through all of the steps where we
08:42 - saw how to develop a JavaScript
08:45 - application locally with docker
08:48 - containers then we saw how to build them
08:50 - into an image just like continuous
08:53 - integration build we'll do it then we
08:56 - pushed it into a private repository and
08:58 - we simulated a development server where
09:01 - we pull the image from private
09:03 - repository and the other images from the
09:06 - docker hub where we started the whole
09:07 - application set up with our own
09:09 - application in the two
09:12 - applications using a docker compose
09:15 - which is how you would deploy an
09:18 - application on a dev server so that now
09:20 - testers or other developers will be able
09:22 - to access the development server and
09:25 - actually try out the application that
09:27 - you just deployed or you can also use it
09:29 - for demos thanks for watching the video
09:31 - I hope it was helpful and if it was
09:33 - don't forget to like it this is a video
09:35 - series so I will create a new one every
09:38 - week so if you want to be notified
09:40 - whenever a new video comes out then
09:42 - subscribe to my channel if you have any
09:45 - questions if something wasn't clear in
09:47 - the video please post them in a comment
09:48 - section below and I will try to answer
09:50 - them so thank you and see you in the
09:53 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video we're gonna see how to deploy an application that we built into a docker image so after you package your application in a docker image and save it in the private repository you need
