With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video I'm gonna show you what
00:02 - mini cube and cube CTL are and how to
00:05 - set them up so first of all let's see
00:12 - what is mini cube usually in kubernetes
00:16 - world when you are setting up a
00:18 - production cluster it will look
00:20 - something like this so you would have
00:22 - multiple masters at least two in a
00:25 - production setting and you would have
00:27 - multiple worker nodes and master nodes
00:30 - and the worker nodes have their own
00:32 - separate responsibilities so as you see
00:35 - on the diagram you would have actual
00:37 - separate virtual or physical machines
00:39 - that each represent a note now if you
00:43 - want to test something on your local
00:45 - environment or if you want to try
00:48 - something out very quickly for example
00:49 - deploying new application or new
00:52 - components and you want to test it on
00:55 - your local machine obviously setting up
00:57 - a cluster like this will be pretty
00:59 - difficult or maybe even impossible if
01:02 - you don't have enough resources like
01:04 - memory and CPU etc and exactly for the
01:07 - use case there's this open-source tool
01:10 - that is called a mini cube so what a
01:12 - mini cube is is basically one node
01:14 - cluster where the master processes and
01:18 - the work processes both run on one node
01:22 - and this node will have a docker
01:24 - container runtime pre-installed so you
01:27 - will be able to run the containers or
01:29 - the pods with containers on this node in
01:31 - the way it's gonna run on your laptop is
01:34 - through a virtual box or some other
01:37 - hypervisor so basically mini cube will
01:40 - create a virtual box on your laptop and
01:43 - our nodes that you see here as this node
01:46 - will run in that virtual box
01:48 - so to summarize mini cube is a one node
01:51 - kubernetes cluster that runs in
01:53 - VirtualBox on your laptop which you can
01:56 - use for testing kubernetes on your local
01:59 - set up so now that you've set up a
02:01 - cluster or a mini cluster on your laptop
02:04 - or PC on your local machine you need
02:06 - some way to interact with a cluster so
02:09 - you want to create components configure
02:11 - it etc
02:13 - and that's where cube CTL comes in the
02:15 - picture
02:17 - so now that you have this virtual note
02:20 - on your local machine that represents
02:23 - mini cube you need some way to interact
02:25 - with a cluster so you need a way to
02:27 - create pots and other kubernetes
02:30 - components on the note and the way to do
02:32 - it is using cube CTL which is a
02:35 - command-line tool for kubernetes cluster
02:37 - so let's see how it actually works
02:39 - remember we said that mini cube runs
02:41 - both master and work processes so one of
02:45 - the master process is called API server
02:47 - is actually the main entry point into
02:50 - the Covenant is cluster so if you want
02:52 - to do anything in the kubernetes if you
02:54 - want to configure anything create any
02:55 - component you first had to talk to the
02:58 - API server and the way to talk to the
03:00 - API server is through different clients
03:02 - so you can have a UI like a dashboard
03:03 - you can talk to it using kubernetes api
03:06 - or a command line tool which is cube CTL
03:10 - and cube CTL is actually the most
03:12 - powerful of all the three clients
03:15 - because with cube CTL you can basically
03:17 - do anything in the kubernetes that you
03:20 - want and throughout this video tutorials
03:22 - we're going to be using cube CTL mostly
03:24 - so once the cube CTL submits commands to
03:27 - the API server to create components
03:29 - delete components etc the work processes
03:32 - on mini cube nodes will actually make it
03:36 - happen so they will be actually
03:38 - executing the comments to create the
03:40 - parts to destroy the power to create
03:42 - services etc so this is the mini cube
03:45 - set up and this is how cube CTL is used
03:48 - to interact with the cluster an
03:49 - important thing to note here is that
03:51 - keeps ETL isn't just for mini cube
03:53 - cluster if you have a cloud cluster or a
03:56 - hybrid cluster whatever keeps it here is
03:59 - the tool to use to interact with any
04:02 - type of kubernetes cluster setup so
04:05 - that's important to note here so now
04:07 - that we know what mini cube and cube
04:09 - ctlr let's actually install them to see
04:11 - them in practice I'm using Mac so the
04:15 - installation process will probably be
04:16 - easier but I'm gonna put the links to
04:19 - the installation guides in the
04:20 - description so you can actually follow
04:22 - them to install it on your operating
04:24 - system just one thing to note here is
04:27 - that mini cube needs a virtualization
04:30 - because as we mentioned
04:31 - it's gonna run in a virtual box setup or
04:34 - some hypervisor so you will need to
04:38 - install some type of hypervisor it could
04:40 - be VirtualBox I'm gonna install a hyper
04:42 - kit but it's gonna be in those
04:44 - step-by-step instructions as well so I'm
04:46 - gonna show you how to install it on a
04:48 - Mac so I have a Mac OS mobi so I'm gonna
04:53 - show you how to install Mini Cube on
04:56 - this mac OS version and I'm gonna be
04:58 - using pro to install it so update and
05:03 - the first thing is that I'm gonna
05:05 - install a hypervisor hyper kids so I'm
05:12 - gonna go with the hyper kit go ahead and
05:16 - install it I already had any install it
05:22 - so with you if you're doing it for the
05:24 - first time it might take longer because
05:27 - it has to download all these
05:28 - dependencies and stuff and now I'm gonna
05:31 - install mini cube and here's the thing
05:38 - mini cube has cube CTL as a dependency
05:41 - so when I execute this it's gonna
05:45 - install cube CTL as well so I don't need
05:49 - to install it separately so let's see
05:53 - here installing dependencies for mini
05:57 - cube which is Cuban Ares CLI this is
06:01 - cube CTL again because I already had it
06:04 - installed before it still has a local
06:07 - copy of the dependencies that's why it's
06:08 - pretty fast it might take longer if
06:12 - you're doing it for the first time so
06:14 - now that everything is installed let's
06:16 - actually check the comments so cube CTL
06:19 - command should be working so I get this
06:22 - list of the commands with keep CTL so
06:24 - it's there and mini who should be
06:26 - working as well and as you see mini cube
06:29 - comes with this command-line tool which
06:31 - is pretty simple so with one command
06:33 - it's gonna bring up the whole kubernetes
06:35 - cluster in this OneNote setup and then
06:40 - you can do stuff with it and you can
06:42 - just stop it or delete it it's pretty
06:44 - easy
06:45 - so now that we have both installed and
06:47 - the comments are there let's actually
06:49 - create a mini cube kubernetes cluster
06:51 - and as you see there is a start command
06:54 - let's actually clear this so this is how
06:57 - we're gonna start a kubernetes cluster
06:59 - queue mini cube start and here is where
07:02 - the hypervisor installed comes in
07:05 - because this meter cube needs to run in
07:07 - virtual environment we're gonna tell
07:10 - mini cube which hypervisor it should use
07:14 - to start a cluster so for that we're
07:16 - gonna specify an option which is VM
07:19 - driver and here I'm gonna set the hyper
07:23 - key that I installed so I'm telling mini
07:26 - cube please use hyper kit hypervisor to
07:30 - start this virtual mini cube cluster so
07:32 - when I execute this it's gonna download
07:35 - some stuff so again it may take a little
07:38 - bit longer if you're doing for the first
07:40 - time and as I mentioned mini cube has
07:45 - docker runtime or daca daemon
07:48 - pre-installed so even if you don't have
07:50 - docker on your machine it's still gonna
07:53 - work so you will be able to create
07:55 - containers inside because it already
07:57 - contains docker which is a pretty good
07:59 - thing if you don't have docker already
08:02 - installed so done cube CTL is now
08:04 - configured to use mini cube which means
08:07 - the mini cube cluster is set up and
08:10 - keeps it yell command which is meant to
08:13 - interact with the kubernetes clusters is
08:15 - also connected with that mini cube
08:18 - cluster which means if I do cube City
08:23 - I'll get notes which just gets me a
08:25 - status of the notes of the kubernetes
08:29 - cluster it's gonna tell me that the mini
08:31 - cube node is ready and as you see it's
08:35 - the only node and it has a master role
08:38 - because it obviously has to run the
08:39 - master processes and I can also get the
08:42 - status with mini cube executing mini
08:46 - cube status so I see houses running
08:49 - cubelet which is a service that actually
08:53 - runs the pots using container run time
08:55 - is running so basically everything is
08:58 - running and by the way if you want
08:59 - see kubernetes architecture in more
09:02 - detail and to understand how master and
09:04 - worker nodes actually work in what all
09:06 - these processes are I have a separate
09:09 - video that covers community architecture
09:12 - so you can check it out on this link and
09:14 - we can also check which version of
09:16 - kubernetes we have installed and usually
09:20 - it's gonna be the latest version so with
09:22 - cube CTL version you actually know what
09:24 - the client version of communities is and
09:26 - what the server version of kubernetes is
09:28 - and here we see we are using 1.17 and
09:33 - that's the kubernetes version that is
09:36 - running in the mini cube cluster so if
09:38 - you see both client version and server
09:40 - version in the output it means that mini
09:42 - cube is correctly installed so from this
09:45 - point on we are gonna be interacting
09:47 - with the mini cube cluster using cube
09:49 - CTL command line tool so mini cube is
09:52 - basically just for the startup and for
09:54 - deleting the cluster but everything else
09:56 - configuring we're gonna be doing through
09:59 - cube CTL so if you at this point have
10:02 - some problems starting a mini cube
10:03 - cluster you can actually started in a
10:07 - debug mode so you can delete the one
10:10 - that you created using mini cube delete
10:12 - it's gonna delete the whole cluster and
10:15 - you're gonna you can start it in a debug
10:19 - mode so basically the aim driver hyper
10:25 - kit and here you can just add these
10:30 - options so using these options you can
10:33 - see everything that's happening when you
10:37 - execute mini cube start in debug mode
10:40 - and it's also gonna print all the errors
10:44 - that happen in the console so if I
10:47 - execute this so as you see the output is
10:50 - pretty verbose with these options so if
10:53 - you have any trouble starting mini cube
10:56 - cluster you can actually see the
10:58 - detailed output in the console if there
11:01 - is some error okay so the mini cube is
11:03 - running again
11:05 - and let's clear this and all these
11:08 - commands that I executed here I'm gonna
11:10 - put them in a list in the comment
11:12 - section so you can actually copy them
11:14 - thanks for watching the video I hope it
11:16 - was helpful and if it was don't forget
11:18 - to like it this is a video series so I
11:20 - will create a new one every week so if
11:23 - you want to be notified whenever a new
11:25 - video comes out then subscribe to my
11:27 - channel if you have any questions if
11:30 - something wasn't clear in the video
11:31 - please post them in a comment section
11:33 - below and I will try to answer them so
11:36 - thank you and see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video I'm gonna show you what mini cube and cube CTL are and how to set them up so first of all let's see what is mini cube usually in kubernetes world when you are setting up a production cluster it will look something like this so you would have multiple masters at least two in a production setting and you would have multiple worker nodes and master nodes and the worker nodes have their own separate responsibilities so as you see on the diagram you would have actual separate virtual or physical machines that each represent a note now if you want to test something on your local

be able to run the containers or the pods with containers on this node in the way it's gonna run on your laptop is through a virtual box or some other hypervisor so basically mini cube will create a virtual box on your laptop and our nodes that you see here as this node will run in that virtual box so to summarize mini cube is a one node kubernetes cluster that runs in VirtualBox on your laptop which you can use for testing kubernetes on your local set up so now that you've set up a cluster or a mini cluster on your laptop or PC on your local machine you need some way to interact with a cluster so you want to create components configure it etc and that's where cube CTL comes in the picture so now that you have this virtual note on your local machine that represents mini cube you need some way to interact with a cluster so you need a way to create pots and other kubernetes components on the note and the way to do it is using cube CTL which is a commandline tool for kubernetes cluster so let's see how it actually works remember we said that mini cube runs both master and work processes so one of the master process is called API server is actually the main entry point into

CTL submits commands to the API server to create components delete components etc the work processes on mini cube nodes will actually make it happen so they will be actually executing the comments to create the parts to destroy the power to create services etc so this is the mini cube set up and this is how cube CTL is used to interact with the cluster an important thing to note here is that keeps ETL isn't just for mini cube cluster if you have a cloud cluster or a hybrid cluster whatever keeps it here is the tool to use to interact with any type of kubernetes cluster setup so that's important to note here so now that we know what mini cube and cube ctlr let's actually install them to see them in practice I'm using Mac so the installation process will probably be easier but I'm gonna put the links to the installation guides in the description so you can actually follow them to install it on your operating system just one thing to note here is that mini cube needs a virtualization because as we mentioned it's gonna run in a virtual box setup or some hypervisor so you will need to install some type of hypervisor it could be VirtualBox I'm gonna install a hyper kit but it's gonna be in those stepbystep instructions as well so I'm gonna show you how to install it on a Mac so I have a Mac OS mobi so I'm gonna show you how to install Mini Cube on this mac OS version and I'm gonna be using pro to install it so update and the first thing is that I'm gonna install a hypervisor hyper kids so I'm gonna go with the hyper kit go ahead and install it I already had any install it so

meter cube needs to run in virtual environment we're gonna tell mini cube which hypervisor it should use to start a cluster so for that we're gonna specify an option which is VM driver and here I'm gonna set the hyper key that I installed so I'm telling mini cube please use hyper kit hypervisor to start this virtual mini cube cluster so when I execute this it's gonna download some stuff so again it may take a little bit longer if you're doing for the first time and as I mentioned mini cube has docker runtime or daca daemon preinstalled so even if you don't have docker on your machine it's

and it has a master role because it obviously has to run the master processes and I can also get the status with mini cube executing mini cube status so I see houses running cubelet which is a service that actually runs the pots using container run time is running so basically everything is running and by the way if you want see kubernetes architecture in more detail and to understand how master

deleting the cluster but everything else configuring we're gonna be doing through cube CTL so if you at this point have some problems starting a mini cube cluster you can actually started in a debug mode so you can delete the one that you created using mini cube delete it's gonna delete the whole cluster and you're gonna you can start it in a debug mode so basically the aim driver hyper kit and here you can just add these options so using these options you can see everything that's happening when you execute mini cube start in debug mode and it's also gonna print all the errors that happen in the console so if I execute this so as you see the output is pretty verbose with these options so if you have any trouble starting mini cube cluster you can actually see the detailed output in the console if there is some error okay so the mini cube is running again and let's clear this and all these commands that I executed here I'm gonna put them in a list in the comment section so you can actually copy them thanks for watching the video I hope it was helpful and if it was don't forget to like it this is a video series so I will create a new one every week so if you want to be notified whenever a new video comes out then subscribe to my channel if you have any questions if something wasn't clear in the video please post them in a comment section below and I will try to answer them
