00:00 - in this video you will learn with very
00:02 - simple examples and visualizations
00:05 - everything about conditionals and
00:07 - comparison operators in JavaScript so
00:10 - first let's see what comparison
00:12 - operators are let's consider as an
00:16 - example Facebook feature to display
00:19 - birthdays of its users so basically if
00:23 - today is your birthday
00:25 - Facebook will show a birthday icon and
00:28 - will send notifications to all your
00:31 - friends and for Facebook to check
00:33 - whether it's your birthday today
00:34 - basically it has to compare today with
00:38 - your birthdate right
00:39 - so that comparison or equals in
00:43 - JavaScript is expressed with 3
00:46 - comparison sites like this so one
00:50 - comparison sign is reserved for
00:53 - assigning variables as we saw in one of
00:56 - my previous videos of variables so
00:59 - double or triple equal signs are used to
01:04 - check the Equality of two values so it's
01:07 - the difference between the two so let's
01:09 - say I have a variable age 30 so if I
01:14 - compare value of variable age to 30 then
01:19 - I get true right if I triple compare
01:23 - that I also get true so same results now
01:27 - if I compare the value with a string
01:32 - representation of 30 I also get true
01:36 - however if I triple check I get false
01:41 - and this is a difference between these
01:44 - two the double comparison checks
01:46 - equality of the values on tooth sides so
01:50 - checks the value here checks the value
01:52 - here and compares them by the value the
01:55 - triple equality compares value and also
01:59 - the type the data type of those values
02:02 - so if I have a number here and a number
02:06 - here which are same values then it's
02:08 - going to be true if I have a number
02:11 - value here which is defined here
02:13 - and a string value here of the same
02:15 - value I get false because the data types
02:18 - are not the same so that's the
02:21 - difference and obviously if I put here
02:23 - another value it's gonna be false in any
02:26 - case right like this or like this
02:29 - doesn't really matter and that little
02:32 - difference can actually have a big
02:34 - impact that's why these concept is
02:36 - important in JavaScript general rule is
02:39 - that you should in most cases use the
02:42 - triple equation to compare two values
02:45 - now let's consider another example where
02:48 - you order something on Amazon it says
02:49 - that shipping is free above purchase of
02:53 - 20 euros so when you add things to your
02:55 - cart program checks whether your order
02:58 - total is above 20 or below 20 and then
03:02 - calculates the shipment costs based on
03:04 - that and let's say charges you 5 euros
03:07 - if your if your total order is under 20
03:11 - euros so now we don't have the equal
03:14 - check anymore but rather is it higher or
03:17 - is it lower so the way to check that is
03:20 - let's clear these so let's define
03:23 - variables so you have the total price
03:25 - let's say you gathered items that are 19
03:28 - euros and now the program checks if
03:31 - total price is greater than 20 euros you
03:37 - get a boolean expression of false
03:39 - because this condition is wrong in the
03:44 - same way the program can also check the
03:46 - opposite direction so you can check
03:48 - whether your total price is below 20 but
03:52 - notice that we don't check for value 20
03:55 - so what happens if the total price is
03:58 - exactly 20 so basically here we need to
04:00 - check that if total price is below 20 or
04:04 - 20 euros in both cases you get charged
04:08 - for the shipping so in order to do that
04:10 - you can combine those two expressions
04:12 - and say like this so either it should be
04:16 - less than 20 or to be exactly 20 for
04:19 - that to be true and as you see each of
04:22 - these comparisons return to you a
04:24 - boolean expression of either
04:27 - or true only one of these outcomes is
04:31 - possible so what this means is that in
04:34 - the program you check if this condition
04:37 - comes out as true then you want to offer
04:41 - free shipping otherwise you want to
04:44 - charge five euros for shipping and the
04:47 - way it's going to be written inside of
04:49 - the program using JavaScript syntax is
04:51 - if your price is greater than twenty
04:55 - here will be code that lets say
04:57 - calculates or sets the price of shipping
05:01 - so here we set it to zero there is no
05:04 - shipping cost otherwise is expressed
05:07 - with else shipping cost equals to five
05:12 - euros so this is how the conditions are
05:16 - used in JavaScript to check the
05:18 - condition and based on that divided this
05:21 - or if we switched that condition we can
05:25 - also check if total price is less than
05:28 - or equal to twenty then shipping cost
05:32 - will be set to five otherwise the
05:36 - shipping cost will be zero so to go back
05:40 - to some technical terms in JavaScript
05:42 - this here is called if-else statements
05:46 - whatever is inside if is called a
05:49 - condition so this thing here that
05:52 - evaluates to either true or false is a
05:53 - condition and this here that compares
05:57 - those two values is called a comparison
05:59 - operator so greater smaller equals etc
06:03 - all these are comparison operators but
06:07 - let's say you have a case where you have
06:08 - three different shipping costs right so
06:11 - for example if the price is below ten
06:14 - euros you get charged five euro shipping
06:17 - costs if it's below twenty you get
06:19 - charged only three euros and if it's
06:22 - above twenty you get charged nothing now
06:25 - you don't have if-else only but you have
06:28 - three conditions it's also super simple
06:30 - to do that with if-else so basically you
06:34 - check again if total price is less than
06:38 - or equal to ten
06:41 - you get charged five euros and here you
06:45 - are gonna say else/if which is another
06:49 - statement where you can write the
06:51 - conditional where we're gonna check
06:53 - where the total price is less than or
06:56 - equal to 20 in that case you get charged
06:59 - three euros and there comes our final
07:02 - else which is zero so now I have three
07:07 - conditions here so the first condition
07:09 - here says it's less than or equal to ten
07:13 - the first one checks another condition
07:16 - and the third one important thing to
07:19 - note here that the last else or the the
07:23 - else here doesn't have a condition
07:25 - explicitly but it implies that both of
07:28 - these above conditions were false so
07:32 - both of them were wrong B and because
07:35 - it's implicit we don't have to check it
07:37 - explicitly here so you could also go
07:40 - here and do that else if price is
07:46 - greater then 20 and this will work just
07:50 - fine however because it's implicit we
07:53 - don't need that so we sell comparisons
07:55 - between two values using equals higher
07:58 - or lower the final operator is not
08:02 - equals
08:03 - for example consider a feature where a
08:06 - web application checks whether user is a
08:09 - Premium Member or not obviously if you
08:13 - are not a premium user you won't see the
08:15 - cool features they have or you won't be
08:18 - able to access some premium content so
08:22 - when you log in program will check is
08:24 - user membership premium so with equals
08:29 - or it can check use a membership not
08:32 - premium and in order to express that
08:35 - negative comparison you use this syntax
08:38 - so not equals in JavaScript is expressed
08:41 - with exclamation mark and double equals
08:44 - and to show that in if-else statements
08:47 - let's say if user membership is not
08:50 - premium show user non-premium
08:54 - contents or maybe even recommend a
08:57 - premium upgrade as a marketing measure
09:00 - and else show premium contents and
09:05 - finally you can combine all these
09:08 - conditions so for example if today is
09:11 - your birthday and you have displayed
09:13 - that on your profile only then the
09:16 - program will show the notification so
09:18 - both conditions must be true so if today
09:22 - state is the same as your birth date and
09:25 - birthday displayed is true so here you
09:29 - can use a comparison with boolean true
09:31 - or false so both these conditions must
09:34 - be true for notification to be sent and
09:38 - in JavaScript the syntax for end is this
09:41 - so this basically is also a valid
09:45 - condition that you can also put inside
09:47 - of the if condition so if this whole
09:50 - thing is true then show notification
09:53 - else do not or another example back to
09:57 - the shipment cost let's say you don't
09:59 - pay for the shipment if the total price
10:02 - is over 20 euros or you have Amazon
10:05 - Prime account so the way to express that
10:08 - would be total price over 20 euros or
10:12 - amazon prime equals so here only one of
10:18 - them has to be true for you to get free
10:21 - shipment or in JavaScript is expressed
10:24 - with double pipes and again you can put
10:27 - that in if statement and say if either
10:32 - this or this is true then give a free
10:37 - shipment otherwise don't and you can
10:40 - also use negation in conditions for
10:44 - example you want to check whether this
10:46 - whole thing is false and the way to do
10:50 - that is using the exclamation mark and
10:54 - the brackets so basically this will
10:57 - check whether this whole condition is
11:00 - false now even if you understood all
11:04 - this concept it's always a good idea to
11:05 - practice them yourself
11:08 - so that you get it better so because of
11:10 - that I'm gonna put a link to practical
11:12 - exercises for conditionals and
11:14 - competitors in the video description
11:17 - below so make sure to check that out and
11:19 - practice yourself with a couple of
11:21 - examples and once you do that you can

Cleaned transcript:

in this video you will learn with very simple examples and visualizations everything about conditionals and comparison operators in JavaScript so first let's see what comparison operators are let's consider as an example Facebook feature to display birthdays of its users so basically if today is your birthday Facebook will show a birthday icon and will send notifications to all your friends and for Facebook to check whether it's your birthday today basically it has to compare today with your birthdate right so that comparison or equals in JavaScript is expressed with 3 comparison sites like this so one comparison sign is reserved for assigning variables as we saw in one of my previous videos of variables so double or triple equal signs are used to check the Equality of two values so it's the difference between the two so let's say I have a variable age 30 so if I compare value of variable age to 30 then I get true right if I triple compare that I also get true so same results now if I compare the value with a string representation of 30 I also get true however if I triple check I get false and this is a difference between these two the double comparison checks equality of the values on tooth sides so checks the value here checks the value here and compares them by the value the triple equality compares value and also the type the data type of those values so if I have a number here and a number here which are same values then it's going to be true if I have a number value here which is defined here and a string value here of the same value I get false because the data types are not the same so that's the difference and obviously if I put here another value it's gonna be false in any case right like this or like this doesn't really matter and that little difference can actually have a big impact that's why these concept is important in JavaScript general rule is that you should in most cases use the triple equation to compare two values now let's consider another example where you order something on Amazon it says that shipping is free above purchase of 20 euros so when you add things to your cart program checks whether your order total is above 20 or below 20 and then calculates the shipment costs based on that and let's say charges you 5 euros if your if your total order is under 20 euros so now we don't have the equal check anymore but rather is it higher or is it lower so the way to check that is let's clear these so let's define variables so you have the total price let's say you gathered items that are 19 euros and now the program checks if total price is greater than 20 euros you get a boolean expression of false because this condition is wrong in the same way the program can also check the opposite direction so you can check whether your total price is below 20 but notice that we don't check for value 20 so what happens if the total price is exactly 20 so basically here we need to check that if total price is below 20 or 20 euros in both cases you get charged for the shipping so in order to do that you can combine those two expressions and say like this so either it should be less than 20 or to be exactly 20 for that to be true and as you see each of these comparisons return to you a boolean expression of either or true only one of these outcomes is possible so what this means is that in the program you check if this condition comes out as true then you want to offer free shipping otherwise you want to charge five euros for shipping and the way it's going to be written inside of the program using JavaScript syntax is if your price is greater than twenty here will be code that lets say calculates or sets the price of shipping so here we set it to zero there is no shipping cost otherwise is expressed with else shipping cost equals to five euros so this is how the conditions are used in JavaScript to check the condition and based on that divided this or if we switched that condition we can also check if total price is less than or equal to twenty then shipping cost will be set to five otherwise the shipping cost will be zero so to go back to some technical terms in JavaScript this here is called ifelse statements whatever is inside if is called a condition so this thing here that evaluates to either true or false is a condition and this here that compares those two values is called a comparison operator so greater smaller equals etc all these are comparison operators but let's say you have a case where you have three different shipping costs right so for example if the price is below ten euros you get charged five euro shipping costs if it's below twenty you get charged only three euros and if it's above twenty you get charged nothing now you don't have ifelse only but you have three conditions it's also super simple to do that with ifelse so basically you check again if total price is less than or equal to ten you get charged five euros and here you are gonna say else/if which is another statement where you can write the conditional where we're gonna check where the total price is less than or equal to 20 in that case you get charged three euros and there comes our final else which is zero so now I have three conditions here so the first condition here says it's less than or equal to ten the first one checks another condition and the third one important thing to note here that the last else or the the else here doesn't have a condition explicitly but it implies that both of these above conditions were false so both of them were wrong B and because it's implicit we don't have to check it explicitly here so you could also go here and do that else if price is greater then 20 and this will work just fine however because it's implicit we don't need that so we sell comparisons between two values using equals higher or lower the final operator is not equals for example consider a feature where a web application checks whether user is a Premium Member or not obviously if you are not a premium user you won't see the cool features they have or you won't be able to access some premium content so when you log in program will check is user membership premium so with equals or it can check use a membership not premium and in order to express that negative comparison you use this syntax so not equals in JavaScript is expressed with exclamation mark and double equals and to show that in ifelse statements let's say if user membership is not premium show user nonpremium contents or maybe even recommend a premium upgrade as a marketing measure and else show premium contents and finally you can combine all these conditions so for example if today is your birthday and you have displayed that on your profile only then the program will show the notification so both conditions must be true so if today state is the same as your birth date and birthday displayed is true so here you can use a comparison with boolean true or false so both these conditions must be true for notification to be sent and in JavaScript the syntax for end is this so this basically is also a valid condition that you can also put inside of the if condition so if this whole thing is true then show notification else do not or another example back to the shipment cost let's say you don't pay for the shipment if the total price is over 20 euros or you have Amazon Prime account so the way to express that would be total price over 20 euros or amazon prime equals so here only one of them has to be true for you to get free shipment or in JavaScript is expressed with double pipes and again you can put that in if statement and say if either this or this is true then give a free shipment otherwise don't and you can also use negation in conditions for example you want to check whether this whole thing is false and the way to do that is using the exclamation mark and the brackets so basically this will check whether this whole condition is false now even if you understood all this concept it's always a good idea to practice them yourself so that you get it better so because of that I'm gonna put a link to practical exercises for conditionals
