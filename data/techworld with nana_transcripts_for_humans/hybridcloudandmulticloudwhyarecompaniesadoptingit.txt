00:00 - in this video we're going to talk about
00:02 - hybrid cloud and multi-cloud
00:04 - we will go through the development from
00:06 - on-premises infrastructure
00:08 - to cloud platforms generally and then we
00:11 - will see what trends and use cases led
00:13 - to companies
00:14 - adopting hybrid cloud and multi-cloud at
00:17 - the end we'll see
00:18 - some of the challenges of moving to
00:20 - multi-cloud and hybrid cloud
00:22 - so what is hybrid cloud hybrid cloud is
00:25 - when you use
00:26 - a private cloud and one public cloud
00:29 - together to understand that let's look
00:31 - at both types of cloud
00:33 - and why is there a need for combining
00:36 - them
00:37 - before cloud companies would buy their
00:39 - own physical servers
00:41 - routers switches and set them up with
00:43 - cables etc right
00:45 - so they'll have their own physical
00:47 - infrastructure
00:48 - also called an on-premise infrastructure
00:51 - that somebody in the company had to
00:53 - manage
00:54 - do maintenance updates fix and replace
00:57 - components if they broke etc and this
01:00 - physical infrastructure and its
01:02 - maintenance as you can imagine
01:04 - costs a lot of money and time
01:07 - but then came the cloud which
01:09 - essentially means
01:10 - somebody else bought all these servers
01:13 - routers
01:14 - switches and set up this physical
01:16 - infrastructure
01:17 - and they are allowing you to access it
01:20 - and use it to run your applications
01:23 - and you probably already know the big
01:24 - cloud providers like
01:26 - aws gcp and azure but there are tons of
01:30 - smaller ones
01:31 - as well all around the world and that's
01:34 - a great concept right because if you are
01:36 - a startup
01:37 - that just wants to run their application
01:39 - and doesn't have resources to buy and
01:41 - set up their own
01:42 - infrastructure you can just rent a
01:44 - couple of servers on
01:45 - cloud and you're good to go and if the
01:47 - router breaks
01:48 - or the hard drive in the server dies you
01:51 - don't need to worry
01:52 - the cloud provider will take care of it
01:54 - you probably won't even notice
01:56 - and that is super efficient because if
01:58 - you have an
01:59 - e-commerce website you are not in the
02:01 - business of managing
02:03 - infrastructure so you just let someone
02:05 - else manage that
02:06 - as their business and you just rent it
02:09 - another cool thing about cloud is that
02:12 - you can add and remove
02:13 - servers as you need with just a couple
02:16 - of clicks
02:17 - so it's very flexible and scalable
02:20 - now why is that a good thing let's say
02:23 - you have an
02:23 - online gift shop and you always get lots
02:26 - of visitors
02:27 - right before holidays so whenever you
02:30 - have such spikes
02:31 - you don't have to go and buy server
02:33 - racks and connect them to your network
02:36 - to handle all the additional users you
02:39 - just spin up a couple of servers
02:40 - on the cloud with one click and done
02:44 - after the holidays if you don't want to
02:46 - pay for the servers you don't need
02:48 - anymore
02:48 - you don't have any physical servers to
02:50 - get rid of you just
02:52 - scale down with a click and that's it
02:54 - that's the famous pay as you go model of
02:57 - cloud platforms in addition to the
02:59 - virtual infrastructure
03:01 - many cloud providers offer services on
03:03 - top
03:04 - to make deploying and running your
03:05 - applications way
03:07 - easier like aws for example has
03:10 - hundreds of services for different use
03:13 - cases like mobile apps
03:15 - web applications machine learning
03:17 - artificial intelligence
03:19 - domain configuration and so on so it
03:22 - seems like
03:23 - there are only benefits to using cloud
03:25 - no
03:26 - upfront investment all these services to
03:28 - make your work
03:29 - easier so you may be thinking every
03:32 - company should want to
03:33 - completely move to cloud well not
03:36 - exactly in fact most companies still use
03:39 - their
03:40 - own on-premises infrastructure now why
03:43 - is that
03:44 - there are actually several reasons for
03:46 - that
03:47 - first of all control over your own
03:49 - infrastructure
03:50 - meaning control over the costs of the
03:53 - infrastructure
03:54 - how well they are managed and secured
03:57 - etc
03:58 - this obviously is a case for large
04:01 - enterprises if they don't want to depend
04:03 - on another company
04:04 - what if the cloud provider goes bankrupt
04:07 - or they can't manage their
04:09 - infrastructure properly and also sure it
04:12 - is
04:12 - cheap to spin up a couple of servers but
04:14 - with a complex application
04:16 - setup the cloud bill can quickly go up
04:19 - another very important reason for that
04:22 - is compliance
04:23 - and security in many countries or
04:26 - industries there are some compliance
04:29 - rules
04:29 - that you have to conform to as a company
04:32 - like if you're a company that does some
04:34 - projects
04:35 - for government or data protection if you
04:38 - have
04:38 - sensitive personal data like medical or
04:41 - payment data
04:42 - so in this case you have much stricter
04:45 - regulations on
04:46 - how and where you store your data and
04:49 - how your applications will be running
04:51 - so what do you do in this case you can't
04:54 - use cloud because you still need
04:56 - some amount of control or you have some
04:58 - compliances you need to fulfill
05:00 - so as you see there are use cases for
05:02 - running workloads on premise
05:04 - but also good use cases for running them
05:06 - on public cloud
05:08 - so which one should you choose you can
05:10 - actually
05:11 - choose both and that is as i mentioned
05:14 - at the beginning
05:15 - a hybrid cloud private cloud and one
05:18 - public cloud
05:19 - that you use together so how does that
05:21 - work
05:22 - let's say you already have an on-premise
05:25 - infrastructure
05:26 - where your online gift shop is running
05:29 - and when you get user spikes on holidays
05:32 - you're going to spin up a couple of
05:34 - servers
05:35 - on a public cloud to service that
05:37 - temporary
05:38 - extra demand this is called cloud
05:41 - bursting
05:42 - or for a data protection use case you
05:45 - will have your database running on
05:47 - premise
05:48 - and your web application on public cloud
05:51 - so these are some of the example
05:53 - use cases of how you can use this
05:55 - combination of private and public cloud
05:58 - so that's a hybrid cloud now let's see
06:01 - what a multi-cloud is
06:03 - and how it differs from hybrid cloud
06:06 - multi-cloud is essentially when you use
06:08 - two or more public clouds
06:10 - for your workloads and there are two
06:13 - main reasons
06:14 - why companies would want to use
06:16 - multi-cloud
06:17 - or basically multiple public clouds
06:20 - one use case is if you want to replicate
06:23 - the same workload
06:24 - on multiple clouds and the second one is
06:28 - if you want to
06:28 - split workload across multiple clouds
06:32 - so let's see what are the use cases for
06:34 - each of these options
06:35 - what if your users are geographically
06:38 - dispersed
06:39 - cloud providers usually have multiple
06:41 - data centers
06:42 - throughout the world but if one provider
06:44 - does not cover
06:46 - all the regions where your users are by
06:49 - running it on another cloud provider
06:51 - you can increase your distribution and
06:53 - service the users
06:55 - from the data center which is closest to
06:57 - them
06:58 - also many companies don't want to be
07:00 - dependent on only one
07:02 - cloud provider like what if that
07:04 - provider goes
07:05 - bankrupt or they have an outage in their
07:07 - data centers and your application is not
07:10 - accessible by users
07:11 - but if you have the same application
07:13 - running on another cloud it will still
07:16 - be accessible
07:18 - so you increase the availability by
07:20 - using multiple cloud platforms
07:23 - so redundancy is great for high
07:26 - availability but of course on each cloud
07:28 - you're running
07:29 - you will pay for it so how do you avoid
07:31 - having huge bills from cloud providers
07:34 - a great way to optimize your costs is
07:37 - using
07:37 - a platform called cast ai which is the
07:40 - sponsor of this video
07:42 - cast ai is an artificial intelligence
07:45 - driven platform
07:46 - to optimize your cloud cost its
07:49 - optimization algorithm is always looking
07:51 - for
07:52 - opportunities to replace vm nodes with
07:55 - less expensive alternatives cast ai uses
07:58 - kubernetes to create a single cluster
08:00 - spinning multiple clouds they are
08:03 - breaking the walls that cloud providers
08:05 - build that
08:06 - lock you in so you can connect your
08:08 - favorite features from
08:09 - every cloud and with cast ai auto
08:12 - scaling
08:12 - you only pay for what you need you can
08:14 - check out cast.ai
08:17 - and you can actually try it out for free
08:19 - now let's see the use cases of when you
08:22 - would want to split your workload across
08:24 - cloud providers if we look at the major
08:27 - cloud platforms like aws
08:29 - google and azure it may seem like they
08:32 - all
08:32 - offer similar services so no big
08:35 - difference between them
08:37 - but in reality there are big differences
08:39 - when it comes to specific
08:41 - tasks or specific services they offer
08:45 - let's see examples let's say you're
08:47 - running your application on aws
08:50 - because it is the best cloud platform
08:52 - for running web applications
08:55 - and now let's say your e-commerce
08:56 - application also gathers
08:59 - tons of data and processes it to make
09:01 - some predictions
09:02 - and intelligent suggestions to users
09:06 - well google cloud happens to have better
09:09 - services
09:10 - for big data processing and analytics so
09:13 - your data engineering team may want to
09:15 - use
09:15 - google cloud for those services instead
09:18 - of aws
09:20 - and also let's say for your internal
09:23 - processes
09:23 - in the company you use some microsoft
09:26 - products
09:27 - and azure cloud has managed services
09:30 - for microsoft products so you want to
09:33 - use azure for that instead of hosting
09:35 - these microsoft
09:37 - products on aws or google cloud or even
09:40 - on premise
09:41 - and managing them yourself so you want
09:43 - to pick and choose the best features
09:46 - from each cloud provider instead of
09:48 - limiting yourself to just
09:50 - one another case where companies end up
09:53 - using multi-cloud is when
09:55 - two companies are merged or one company
09:58 - acquires another
09:59 - and if these two companies use different
10:02 - cloud providers
10:03 - the new merged company automatically
10:05 - ends up with
10:06 - a multi-cloud setup which then the
10:09 - central iet operations team will have to
10:11 - integrate and for multi-cloud note that
10:14 - you can have
10:15 - an on-premise in addition to multiple
10:18 - public clouds
10:20 - and that will actually be the case very
10:22 - often
10:23 - where companies expand from hybrid cloud
10:26 - to multi-cloud
10:27 - now this may all sound great and
10:29 - beneficial in theory but multi-cloud as
10:32 - well as
10:33 - hybrid cloud comes with a lot of
10:36 - challenges
10:37 - first of all with each additional
10:39 - environment you have
10:40 - one more completely different
10:42 - environment your it
10:44 - and devops team has to manage and to
10:46 - manage the different cloud environments
10:49 - in addition to on-premise infrastructure
10:52 - they need to actually learn how to do
10:54 - that each cloud provider has a different
10:57 - set of apis
10:58 - and services that you have to know how
11:00 - to work with
11:02 - there are even certifications for each
11:04 - cloud provider
11:06 - so some companies may end up having an
11:08 - on-premise team
11:10 - and aws team and google cloud team etc
11:14 - which again means a lot of resources
11:17 - and also you can't move to a cloud
11:20 - in one step because each environment
11:23 - is so different you can't just take your
11:26 - application
11:26 - and deploy it the exact same way on
11:29 - another platform
11:30 - without some kind of re-architecting for
11:33 - example
11:33 - if you're using aws lambdas for your
11:36 - application
11:37 - you will have to rewrite some parts of
11:39 - your application
11:40 - if you want to run it on google cloud
11:43 - servers for example
11:44 - so basically on any cloud where you use
11:47 - their special services because they make
11:50 - your work
11:51 - way easier you will have some kind of
11:54 - vendor locking which makes
11:56 - multi-cloud much more challenging
11:59 - now how to address some of these
12:02 - challenges
12:03 - well there are many tools out there and
12:05 - many patterns
12:06 - to make multi-cloud easier to give you
12:09 - some examples
12:10 - kubernetes is one such tool which makes
12:13 - running your applications
12:15 - somewhat generic because it's not
12:17 - dependent on the underlying platform
12:20 - you deploy your applications on
12:22 - kubernetes the same way
12:24 - no matter where your kubernetes cluster
12:26 - is running
12:27 - of course you may still need to use
12:29 - cloud services
12:30 - in your kubernetes cluster but it still
12:33 - makes the multi-cloud
12:35 - easier compared to running your
12:36 - applications directly
12:38 - on the servers packer is another example
12:42 - which allows you to build artifacts
12:45 - for different target environments from
12:47 - the same
12:48 - source code so your code stays the same
12:51 - just the packaging will be different
12:53 - depending on
12:54 - where it must run or there are also
12:57 - continuous delivery platforms
12:59 - for multi-cloud deployments like
13:01 - spinnaker for example
13:03 - and many other tools and examples like
13:06 - this that make it
13:07 - easier to work with multi-cloud
13:10 - setups but again that would mean even
13:13 - more stuff to learn
13:14 - and more complexity so if you want to
13:17 - learn these technologies
13:19 - in an easy way and stay up to date then
13:22 - subscribe to my channel because
13:23 - i will cover more topics and
13:26 - technologies
13:27 - related to multi-cloud and hybrid cloud
13:30 - and with that thank you for watching and
13:32 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to talk about hybrid cloud and multicloud we will go through the development from onpremises infrastructure to cloud platforms generally and then we will see what trends and use cases led to companies adopting hybrid cloud and multicloud at the end we'll see some of the challenges of moving to multicloud and hybrid cloud so what is hybrid cloud hybrid cloud is when you use a private cloud and one public cloud together to understand that let's look at both types of cloud and why is there a need for combining them before cloud companies would buy their own physical servers routers switches and set them up with cables etc right so they'll have their own physical infrastructure also called an onpremise infrastructure that somebody in the company had to manage do

essentially means somebody else bought all these servers routers switches and set up this physical infrastructure and they are allowing you to access it and use it to run your applications and you probably already know the big cloud providers like aws gcp and azure but there are tons of smaller ones as well all around the world and that's a great concept right because if you are a startup that just wants to run their application and doesn't have resources to buy and set up their own infrastructure you can just rent a couple of servers on cloud and you're good to go and if the router breaks or the hard drive in the server dies you don't need to worry the cloud provider will take care of it you probably won't even notice and that is super efficient because if you have an ecommerce website you are not in the business of managing infrastructure so you just let someone else manage that as their business and you just rent it another cool thing about cloud is that you can add and remove servers as you need with just a couple of clicks so it's very flexible and scalable now why is that a good thing let's say you have an online gift shop and you always get lots of visitors right before holidays so whenever you have such spikes you don't have to go and buy server racks and connect them to your network to handle all the additional users you just spin up a couple of servers on the cloud with one click and done after the holidays if you don't want to pay for the servers you don't need anymore you don't have any physical servers to get rid of you just scale down with a click and that's it that's the famous pay as you go model of cloud platforms in addition to the virtual infrastructure many cloud providers offer services on top to make deploying and running your applications way easier like aws for example has hundreds of services for different use cases like mobile apps web applications machine learning artificial intelligence domain configuration and so on so it seems like there are only benefits to using cloud no upfront investment all these services to make your work easier so you may be thinking every company should want to completely move to cloud well not exactly in fact most companies still use their own onpremises infrastructure now why is that there are actually several reasons for that first of all control over your own infrastructure meaning control over the costs of the infrastructure how well they are managed and secured etc this obviously is a case for large enterprises if they don't want to depend on another company what if the cloud provider goes bankrupt or they can't manage their infrastructure properly and also sure it is cheap to spin up a couple of servers but with a complex application setup the cloud bill can quickly go up another very important reason for that is compliance and security in many countries or industries there are some compliance rules that you have to conform to as a company like if you're a company that does some projects for government or data protection if you have sensitive personal data like medical or payment data so in this case you have much stricter regulations on how and where you store your data and how your applications will be running so what do you do in this case you can't use cloud because you still need some amount of control or you have some compliances you need to fulfill so as you see there are use cases for running workloads on premise but also good use cases for running them on public cloud so which one should you choose you can actually choose both and that is as i mentioned at the beginning a hybrid cloud private cloud and one public cloud that you use together so how does that work let's say you already have an onpremise infrastructure where your online gift shop is running and when you get user spikes on holidays you're going to spin up a couple of servers on a public cloud to service that temporary extra demand this is called cloud bursting or for a data protection use case you will have your database running on premise and your web application on public cloud so these are some of the example use cases of how you can use this combination of
