00:02 - hello and welcome
00:03 - to the complete terraform course in
00:06 - which
00:07 - you will master the most popular
00:09 - infrastructure provisioning tool
00:11 - by the end of this course you will have
00:14 - a great understanding of terraform
00:16 - concepts
00:17 - as well as hands-on experience to be
00:20 - able to use
00:21 - terraform with confidence in your
00:23 - projects
00:24 - you will learn all the core concepts
00:27 - with
00:28 - several practical demos in which we will
00:31 - automate aws infrastructure aws
00:35 - is the most popular cloud provider
00:37 - nowadays which makes the combination of
00:39 - terraform
00:40 - and aws a very powerful and demanded
00:44 - skill
00:44 - so knowing how to manage aws
00:47 - infrastructure with terraform
00:49 - will definitely give you an advantage in
00:51 - the devops job market
00:53 - but of course you will be able to apply
00:55 - this knowledge for
00:56 - any other cloud provider or platform out
00:59 - there because
01:00 - most of the concepts in terraform are
01:02 - still the same
01:03 - i will give you an overview of what
01:05 - you'll learn
01:06 - step by step in the first part you will
01:09 - learn the core concepts of terraform
01:12 - where i will also explain how terraform
01:15 - differs
01:16 - from other automation tools and what are
01:18 - the best practices and use cases
01:21 - of terraform in real projects after that
01:24 - we will go through
01:25 - all the main terraform concepts that you
01:28 - will need in
01:29 - any terraform project like how to
01:31 - connect
01:32 - to a platform we want to automate with
01:35 - terraform
01:36 - or how to create and fetch resources on
01:39 - that platform
01:40 - you'll also learn a very important
01:42 - concept of terraform state
01:44 - as well as how to make the same
01:46 - terraform configuration
01:47 - reusable for different environments
01:51 - and different use cases using variables
01:54 - and
01:54 - output values and we'll also look at how
01:57 - to use
01:58 - environmental variables in terraform and
02:00 - of course
02:01 - we will learn all the relevant terraform
02:04 - commands
02:04 - you will learn all of these using
02:06 - hands-on demos so
02:08 - each video will be a combination of
02:10 - understanding the concepts
02:12 - and seeing it in action immediately in
02:15 - the second part
02:16 - we work on a real-life demo project we
02:19 - will automate creating
02:20 - a virtual server on aws in its own
02:23 - private network with all the needed
02:26 - configuration
02:27 - first we will create the main aws
02:29 - network
02:30 - resources like vpc subnet route table
02:34 - internet gateway and security group and
02:36 - configure all of them
02:38 - correctly to deploy our virtual server
02:41 - instance on aws
02:43 - now if you don't have any pre-existing
02:45 - knowledge of aws
02:47 - and its components and services you
02:50 - don't need to worry because
02:51 - i will explain every aws service or
02:54 - concept
02:55 - that we will use in this course so that
02:58 - you can easily follow along
03:00 - after that we will deploy an ec2 server
03:04 - instance on our configured
03:06 - infrastructure
03:07 - we will also automate installing docker
03:10 - and starting a docker container on this
03:12 - newly created
03:13 - aws ec2 server instance
03:17 - in addition we will also automate
03:19 - creating ssh
03:20 - key pair on aws so that we can ssh into
03:24 - our ec2 instance
03:25 - as well as configure firewall rule to
03:28 - access the deployed container
03:29 - application
03:30 - from the browser and finally throughout
03:34 - the course
03:35 - we will use git to manage our
03:37 - configuration code
03:38 - which is a best practice in
03:41 - infrastructure as code
03:43 - so you will see some of the tips for
03:46 - managing
03:47 - terraform codes specifically in git
03:50 - in the last section you will learn
03:52 - additional concepts
03:53 - of terraform and we will improve our
03:56 - configuration
03:57 - of the demo project with some best
04:00 - practices
04:01 - first of all you will learn how to
04:03 - modularize your terraform project
04:05 - and how to make use of existing modules
04:08 - from the terraform registry
04:09 - to simplify your own configurations
04:12 - we'll also configure
04:14 - our terraform project to use a remote
04:16 - state
04:17 - with aws s3 bucket storage
04:20 - and you will learn why using remote
04:23 - storage is so
04:24 - important and useful in terraform
04:26 - projects
04:28 - and finally you will learn the concept
04:30 - of provisioners
04:32 - and how and for what use cases
04:35 - provisioners should be used in real
04:38 - projects
04:39 - so all of these will be fully automated
04:42 - and
04:42 - parameterized with variables so we can
04:46 - replicate it on
04:47 - any environment with different
04:48 - configurations as
04:50 - it is done with best practices so to
04:53 - summarize
04:54 - this course is perfect for people who
04:57 - are completely new to terraform
04:59 - and infrastructure is code concept
05:02 - generally
05:02 - and would like to learn it in an easy
05:05 - and efficient way
05:07 - through hands-on demos and examples
05:10 - but also want to understand the concepts
05:12 - behind
05:13 - again after that course you will be
05:16 - ready to use terraform with confidence
05:18 - at your work or in any of your projects
05:22 - and as i mentioned no need for previous
05:24 - aws knowledge as
05:26 - the resources that we're going to create
05:27 - on aws
05:29 - are also explained in detail in the
05:31 - course
05:33 - you can find this course on udemy so
05:35 - check out the description
05:36 - for more information hope to see you
05:39 - there
