00:00 - kubernetes is one of the most popular
00:03 - tools in cloud computing and is becoming
00:05 - more and more popular every day all the
00:08 - projects are migrating to kubernetes and
00:11 - it's already becoming the standard in
00:13 - most companies as a result of course the
00:16 - need for it professionals who know
00:18 - kubernetes is higher than ever and is
00:21 - increasing every year but the demand for
00:24 - kubernetes professionals is way higher
00:26 - than the number of people who actually
00:28 - know kubernetes this means if you invest
00:32 - time in learning kubernetes and getting
00:34 - certified as a kubernetes administrator
00:37 - you'll have an incredible advantage and
00:39 - a head start in your it career
00:42 - now kubernetes is not the easiest tool
00:44 - to learn
00:45 - set up and manage so if you want to
00:48 - become a kubernetes administrator you
00:50 - will need to learn a bunch of stuff
00:53 - i have taught hundreds of thousands of
00:55 - people kubernetes through my videos and
00:58 - now i have created this full course to
01:01 - teach you everything necessary to get
01:03 - started with kubernetes from xero and
01:06 - become an expert in it
01:08 - you will be prepared to handle any
01:10 - issues in the cluster you will know
01:12 - exactly how kubernetes works and be able
01:15 - to support teams in your company to use
01:18 - kubernetes properly after completing
01:20 - this course this course is mostly demo
01:23 - led projects where you work hands-on
01:26 - along with me to practically apply all
01:29 - the concepts you learn but also
01:31 - understand the use cases of each concept
01:34 - and really know why and how to use it
01:37 - and to make understanding the
01:38 - theoretical concepts easier we have
01:41 - animated videos and real world examples
01:44 - to understand how it all applies in the
01:46 - real world projects
01:48 - now you also know how important it is to
01:51 - prove your knowledge in the i.t world
01:54 - and a certification is a great way to
01:56 - show your skills and this course
01:58 - prepares you completely for the cka exam
02:02 - so that you can become a certified
02:05 - kubernetes administrator so let's go
02:07 - through the course contents and see what
02:10 - you will learn from our kubernetes
02:12 - administrator course
02:14 - we will start with the main kubernetes
02:16 - concept and understand how kubernetes
02:19 - architecture works what communities
02:21 - resources are
02:22 - learn about kubernetes configuration
02:24 - files and generally how to work with
02:27 - kubernetes
02:28 - we will then install a kubernetes
02:30 - cluster from scratch on virtual machines
02:34 - for that we will use a cube adm tool and
02:36 - learn and understand all the concepts
02:39 - about control plane processes how they
02:41 - work how they get configured and so on
02:44 - you will also learn about container
02:46 - runtime interface in kubernetes and how
02:49 - is it possible to use different
02:51 - container runtime technologies with
02:53 - kubernetes we will also look at a very
02:55 - interesting topic which is
02:57 - networking in kubernetes and container
03:01 - networking interface we will learn about
03:03 - how pod networking works and how it is
03:06 - configured as well as install a
03:08 - networking plugin to create a networking
03:11 - layer in our kubernetes cluster we will
03:13 - also learn how dns works in kubernetes
03:16 - and learn about core dns which is the
03:19 - dns service in kubernetes we will also
03:22 - take a look at how certificates work in
03:24 - kubernetes what certificates get
03:27 - automatically created and how you as a
03:30 - kubernetes administrator can manage that
03:32 - in the same section we will also learn
03:35 - about very important kubernetes concepts
03:37 - like namespaces how to work with cubectl
03:41 - which is a kubernetes command line tool
03:43 - you will learn about cubeconfig file and
03:45 - how to use that to connect to the
03:47 - cluster as well as how to configure and
03:49 - modify that and also using cube adm tool
03:53 - you will learn how to join any worker
03:55 - nodes to the cluster once you have
03:57 - installed and configured the cluster of
04:00 - course you want to start deploying your
04:01 - applications in it and make it
04:04 - accessible externally so we will learn
04:06 - how to deploy applications inside the
04:08 - cluster using deployments and how to
04:12 - make them accessible with services you
04:15 - will also learn about different types of
04:17 - services in kubernetes how to use each
04:20 - one and more importantly how they
04:22 - compare to each other one of the common
04:24 - ways of configuring external access to
04:27 - our applications running in kubernetes
04:30 - is ingress so you will learn what
04:33 - ingress controller is and how to create
04:35 - ingress resources to configure routing
04:38 - in a cluster and since we will be
04:41 - installing the ingress controller
04:42 - application using helm you will also
04:45 - learn what helm is how it works and how
04:47 - to use it to easily install different
04:50 - applications in kubernetes now of course
04:53 - you won't be the only one working with
04:55 - the cluster because developer teams and
04:57 - other people will also need access but
05:00 - you can't just give everyone admin
05:02 - access to the cluster so we will learn
05:05 - about the concept of users and
05:07 - permissions in kubernetes we will learn
05:09 - about our back or role based access
05:12 - control we will also learn how client
05:14 - certificates work in kubernetes and will
05:17 - create a client certificate for a new
05:19 - cluster user since devops is all about
05:22 - automation you will have to automate
05:24 - processes like deploying applications
05:27 - from the cicd pipeline to kubernetes for
05:30 - such integrations you also need users
05:33 - and permissions so we will learn how to
05:35 - create non-human users for different
05:38 - tools that interact with kubernetes when
05:41 - working with kubernetes things will go
05:43 - wrong so everyone using kubernetes
05:46 - should learn how to properly debug and
05:48 - troubleshoot the cluster so you will
05:50 - learn about different ways of
05:52 - troubleshooting and debugging in
05:54 - kubernetes using temporary pods cube ctl
05:57 - formatting and also how to debug and fix
06:00 - cubelet service issues etc a very common
06:03 - use case is running multiple containers
06:06 - in a kubernetes pod so you will learn
06:09 - about such use cases and how to
06:11 - implement that using init containers and
06:13 - multi-container pots when deploying
06:16 - databases or other stateful applications
06:19 - in kubernetes
06:20 - you need to take care of persisting the
06:23 - data for that we will learn about
06:25 - volumes what different types of volumes
06:27 - are available for different use cases
06:30 - and how to configure each one of them we
06:33 - will also see how to create external
06:35 - configuration for our applications with
06:38 - config map and secret components
06:41 - now when you have hundreds or thousands
06:43 - of pods running in your cluster you want
06:46 - to make sure each pod has enough
06:48 - resources to run and also that one pod
06:52 - doesn't take up all the resources on the
06:54 - server for that we will learn how to
06:57 - configure resource requests and limits
06:59 - in pods next we will learn about
07:01 - concepts of taints and tolerations as
07:04 - well as node selectors node affinity and
07:08 - inter-pod affinity in kubernetes and
07:11 - what role they play in scheduling pods
07:14 - in the cluster you will also learn how
07:16 - to configure health status checks for
07:19 - containers inside the pods using
07:22 - liveness and readiness probes when
07:25 - deploying new application releases in a
07:27 - cluster it's important to understand how
07:29 - the pods get upgraded to the new
07:32 - application version so for that we will
07:34 - learn about deployment strategies in
07:36 - kubernetes
07:37 - such as rolling updates and how all this
07:41 - works
07:42 - one of the important tasks of the
07:43 - kubernetes administrator is to prepare
07:46 - for any disaster scenarios and make it
07:49 - possible to easily recover cluster in
07:52 - such cases
07:53 - for that we will learn how to backup and
07:55 - restore ecd data and also learn the
07:59 - theoretical concepts behind in many
08:02 - cases you may need to automate your
08:04 - tasks with kubernetes and for that it's
08:06 - important to learn
08:08 - how kubernetes rest api works and how to
08:11 - use it to get information from the
08:13 - cluster as well as make changes to it
08:15 - another very common task for a
08:17 - kubernetes administrator is making sure
08:20 - the cluster is always up to date using
08:23 - the latest kubernetes version so you
08:26 - will learn step by step how to upgrade
08:29 - kubernetes cluster on control plane
08:31 - nodes as well as worker nodes as a
08:33 - cluster admin you will often have to
08:36 - manage multiple kubernetes clusters and
08:39 - for that it's important to know the
08:41 - concept of context and how to use
08:44 - contexts to switch between clusters when
08:47 - administering them
08:49 - as part of the kubernetes administrator
08:51 - job you will also learn how to check
08:53 - expiration of kubernetes certificates
08:56 - and how to renew them when configuring
08:58 - kubernetes clusters you will have to
09:00 - also take care of securing your cluster
09:03 - in different ways
09:04 - one of the ways of securing the cluster
09:07 - is by restricting the communication
09:09 - between the applications within the
09:12 - cluster to minimize the attack surface
09:15 - and for that we will learn about the
09:17 - network policies and how to configure
09:20 - them in kubernetes and finally if you
09:23 - want to take the cka exam i prepared
09:26 - some useful tips that will help you
09:28 - totally ace the exam now equipped with
09:31 - all this knowledge you'll be prepared to
09:34 - pass the kubernetes administrator exam
09:37 - but more importantly be able to actually
09:40 - set up and administer kubernetes
09:42 - clusters in your projects
09:44 - the course is accompanied with a git
09:46 - repository including all the relevant
09:48 - links commands and examples i'm using in
09:51 - the demos so you can easily work along i
09:55 - am super excited to teach you all this
09:57 - so let's get started
