With timestamps:

00:00 - AI is the hottest topic right now and AI
00:03 - tools are being developed for all areas
00:05 - including different it Fields And since
00:08 - you are on the tech world with Nana
00:10 - Channel we will be talking about the AI
00:12 - tools specifically for devops and Cloud
00:15 - use cases to make it more interesting
00:17 - and valuable for you I decided to focus
00:20 - on categories of AI tools like
00:23 - monitoring security Improvement and so
00:26 - on instead of just comparing random or
00:30 - most popular AI Tools Plus I'm going to
00:32 - give you my honest experience of using
00:35 - these tools in my actual devops projects
00:37 - and explain why I'm not the biggest fan
00:39 - of AI tools right now and just a heads
00:42 - up none of the tools I cover in these
00:45 - categories are sponsored plus you know
00:47 - my motto which is Concepts before tools
00:51 - so all examples are from my practical
00:53 - experience in my engineering projects
00:55 - and my additional extensive research
00:58 - that I do for each video and if there is
01:01 - a sponsored mention of a tool I will
01:05 - explicitly highlight that in the video
01:08 - for example later in this video I'm
01:09 - going to announce a sponsor because I'm
01:12 - very proud of few awesome tech companies
01:15 - that we work with and by the way
01:17 - recently we saw that 70% of you who
01:20 - watch our videos are still unsubscribed
01:22 - if you received value from any of our
01:25 - videos be sure to subscribe so you don't
01:27 - miss any new content we put out out here
01:30 - and by the way in the comments you can
01:32 - also make suggestions about which tools
01:35 - or which tutorials you want us to create
01:39 - and post here with that out of the way
01:41 - let's get to it devops is all about
01:43 - Automation and efficiency right whether
01:46 - we want to release a new feature fast or
01:49 - secure our infrastructure or monitor our
01:52 - platform and prevent any issues in time
01:55 - as part of devop principles all these
01:57 - should be and can be automated so
02:00 - imagine a scenario where AI is helping
02:03 - take over the tedious repetitive tasks
02:06 - help automate things and help engineers
02:08 - make databased decisions this means
02:12 - super fast code validations proactive
02:15 - support in case some issues happen on
02:17 - your Cloud infrastructure or commence
02:19 - cluster automatically detecting security
02:21 - threats and super quick response to
02:24 - incidents all driven by the power of AI
02:28 - now if this sounds too good to be true
02:30 - well because it is most AI tools right
02:33 - now aren't mature enough to use them on
02:37 - autopilot right now you need to use them
02:39 - like any other tool they can't do
02:42 - everything automatically for you in fact
02:44 - many of them still need a lot of human
02:47 - review and validation but that doesn't
02:50 - mean that they are useless there are
02:52 - still some really good use cases for AI
02:55 - tools right now now the obvious one we
02:58 - all know is cat gbt which I'm not going
03:00 - to talk about here because it's much
03:02 - more general purpose it's not specific
03:05 - for devops plus I actually have two
03:07 - videos on chbt with extensive use cases
03:11 - so you can check them out here but even
03:14 - though you may be getting by with C GPT
03:16 - for now these kind of tools have many
03:19 - limitations when it comes to devops and
03:21 - Cloud specifically when we think about
03:24 - devops and all these automations and
03:25 - Cloud platforms with so many services
03:27 - it's always about integrating various
03:30 - tools together to build these automated
03:33 - processes right like you need to
03:35 - automate monitoring in your cluster and
03:37 - automatically notify teams of any
03:39 - abnormal behavior you want to automate
03:41 - detecting security issues or you want to
03:43 - help automate the provisioning of
03:45 - infrastructure and generally the
03:47 - integration of various tools together
03:49 - and by the way if you haven't already
03:51 - you can download our complete devops
03:53 - road map which I created to give a good
03:56 - structured overview of all the elements
03:59 - of devil in exactly the right sequence
04:01 - to understand the complete flow you can
04:04 - grab the tech Devils road map directly
04:06 - on our website for completely free
04:09 - because I believe everybody should have
04:11 - access to this important knowledge I
04:14 - will leave the link to it in the video
04:16 - description so go grab it from there so
04:19 - what are the use cases of AI in devops
04:22 - and Cloud the first category we have is
04:25 - the AI code assistants and the main use
04:28 - case for such tools is in writing
04:30 - infrastructure as code or configuration
04:32 - as code and so on a popular example here
04:35 - is GitHub co-pilot and there are lots of
04:39 - very similar tools that basically do the
04:41 - same they are your code assistant within
04:44 - the code editor or IDE so they help you
04:47 - with code suggestions code completions
04:50 - basically they predict what you want to
04:52 - code based on the current context and
04:55 - suggest that code for you or you can ask
04:59 - specifically to give you code piece or
05:01 - entire code block by simply typing the
05:04 - logic in English and it will give you a
05:06 - respective code for that functionality
05:09 - you can even ask it to refactor a code
05:11 - block or clean up the code find any code
05:14 - duplications any dirty code so to say
05:17 - and also interesting use case is you can
05:19 - ask it any explanation on the
05:21 - application code or Improvement
05:23 - suggestions so for example if you're a
05:25 - junior engineer trying to figure out
05:27 - what the terraform code in your new
05:30 - project does you can use an AI assistant
05:33 - to understand the code so you can use it
05:36 - to actually learn and become better at
05:38 - the infrastructure as code tool that
05:41 - your new team is working with now the
05:43 - limitation of such tools based on my
05:46 - experience of using various such AI code
05:49 - assistants for my devop projects is that
05:51 - the code they generate is usually not
05:53 - entirely usable so you still need to
05:56 - validate the output before you can use
05:59 - it or in most cases you have to fix the
06:02 - output because output of the tool simply
06:05 - doesn't work so sometimes you have to
06:07 - double check with the official
06:08 - documentation and so on I actually did a
06:11 - separate video on GitHub copilot and the
06:13 - entire overview here and as I said there
06:16 - are many other AI code assistants out
06:18 - there like Amazon Q which I also covered
06:21 - so you can learn more on those tools and
06:24 - some interesting use cases about them of
06:26 - how to use them as a devops engineer in
06:28 - those videos
06:30 - now code assistants are useful when you
06:32 - can use it directly in your code editor
06:35 - while actually writing the code so you
06:37 - don't have to switch between your code
06:39 - editor and internet browser to use those
06:42 - tools so all these tools have this
06:44 - feature to be integrated in any popular
06:47 - editor or IDE like Visual Studio code or
06:50 - intellig Etc and interesting to point
06:53 - out that there is even an AI powered
06:56 - code editor like cursor where the editor
06:59 - itself has the AI integration so it
07:02 - gives you a lot of the additional
07:04 - features to AI code assistance as part
07:07 - of the editor itself now most of the
07:08 - functionality is very comparable to the
07:10 - AI code assistants but the main
07:12 - advantage here is that the editor the
07:14 - cursor editor is actually able to
07:16 - understand the project context better to
07:20 - give you more precise code suggestions
07:22 - or answers to your code related
07:25 - questions the next one is actually a use
07:27 - case which I think is much more useful
07:30 - than AI code assistance for devops and
07:33 - cloudspace which is AI powered
07:35 - monitoring tools monitoring in devops
07:38 - and cloud is a really complex thing that
07:41 - absolutely needs to be automated when
07:43 - you have very complex systems with
07:46 - thousands of servers and tens of
07:47 - thousands of components on those servers
07:50 - you can't do observability manually you
07:53 - have to automated and alert proactively
07:56 - when the services and applications in
07:59 - your system system behave abnormally
08:01 - because you can be sitting in front of
08:03 - the dashboard or manually checking that
08:06 - all your services are running properly
08:08 - but configuring automated monitoring and
08:10 - alerting is actually a pretty
08:12 - challenging task so this is where
08:14 - monitoring AI tools may be useful one
08:18 - popular such tool is data Do's Watchdog
08:21 - so Watchdog is part of the data dog
08:24 - platform so it's basically like a
08:27 - builtin intelligence layer that
08:30 - continuously analyzes billions of data
08:32 - points from your infrastructure to
08:36 - applications to the underlying platform
08:39 - to find the issues proactively and help
08:42 - you resolve them quickly and the good
08:44 - thing is that data doc also has a
08:46 - feature that basically kind of digs into
08:49 - the issue to identify what actually
08:52 - caused that issue because once the issue
08:55 - is identified the troubleshooting part
08:57 - alone can take a lot of time to exactly
09:01 - pinpoint which one of your thousands of
09:04 - components in your systems actually
09:06 - caused that abnormal behavior or that
09:08 - error so again by analyzing the data
09:11 - about how the services are connected to
09:14 - each other how they correlate how they
09:17 - behave it can pinpoint exactly where the
09:19 - issue is coming from so again you can
09:21 - save yourself manual effort on
09:23 - troubleshooting and fighting root cause
09:25 - of the issue and one more thing which is
09:28 - also very important is is what's called
09:30 - Predictive Analytics it basically means
09:32 - that by analyzing previous data on all
09:36 - the abnormal behavior that has happened
09:38 - and identifying any Trends it can
09:41 - actually tell you if there are any
09:43 - potential issues that may happen in the
09:46 - future and as I said this is much more
09:49 - interesting use case because this is
09:51 - exactly the strength of an AI that it
09:54 - can analyze large sets of historical
09:57 - data as well as analyze the data for
09:59 - correlations between the systems between
10:01 - the services and applications and find
10:04 - the exact issues as well as predict any
10:06 - potential issues before they happen now
10:09 - at the heart of devops are cic City
10:12 - pipelines right that's where a lot of
10:14 - devops Automation and optimization work
10:17 - is done and one of the cicd tools that
10:20 - really focuses on saving time of the
10:23 - developers and optimizing the release
10:26 - workflow is team City pipelines from jet
10:29 - brains who is a sponsor of this entire
10:32 - video so big shout out to Jet brains for
10:36 - supporting our channel so we can create
10:38 - valuable devops tutorials like this one
10:41 - I've used the team City pipelines
10:43 - already and what stood out for me is the
10:46 - main focus on developer productivity by
10:49 - providing self-tuning pipelines which
10:52 - have basically builtin pipeline
10:55 - optimization options so while you're
10:57 - building and configuring the PIP line in
11:00 - the team City pipelines tool the
11:02 - platform itself guides you with buil-in
11:05 - intelligent suggestions of how to
11:08 - optimize your pipeline and because of
11:10 - that the biggest convenience for me was
11:12 - that I don't have to switch back and
11:13 - forth to some documentation and back to
11:16 - the tool to configure various details of
11:20 - the pipeline like adding caching or
11:22 - running jobs in parallel to speed up
11:25 - pipeline execution and so on now if you
11:28 - know me you know I I don't like
11:29 - configuring things in UI everything
11:32 - needs to be scripted as per devops best
11:34 - practices everything is code right so
11:37 - the way I used team City pipelines
11:39 - myself is I configure the pipeline via
11:41 - the tool in the UI using its self-tuning
11:44 - features and once I'm done I can save
11:47 - the pipeline configuration and it will
11:50 - automatically save the yl configuration
11:53 - of my pipeline in my git repository
11:56 - simple as that as always I will leave
11:58 - all the relevant links in the video
11:59 - description and you can actually try out
12:02 - team City pipelines for free now on to
12:04 - the next AI tool for devops another
12:07 - interesting use case is security Centric
12:11 - tools specifically tools that can
12:13 - prevent any security issues before they
12:16 - happen by doing Security checks and
12:19 - discovering any security vulnerabilities
12:21 - based on statistical data or abnormal
12:24 - behavior detected in the systems there
12:26 - are some security AI tools that even
12:29 - allow operations team to configure autof
12:32 - fixes when security issues or
12:34 - misconfigurations are detected so the
12:36 - tool itself will find and fix the
12:39 - security issue before it can get
12:41 - exploited one popular tool in this
12:43 - category is Cystic which similar to data
12:47 - dog uses machine learning and advanced
12:49 - analytics to give you proactive
12:52 - monitoring of large complex systems
12:55 - especially in containerized environments
12:58 - and we know in today's devops world
13:00 - containers are a standard you may have
13:03 - thousands of containers running
13:05 - different services and your applications
13:07 - on multiple environments and imagine if
13:09 - you have thousands of containers on
13:11 - different systems how hard it is to make
13:14 - sure that each container and each
13:16 - service within that container is
13:18 - actually running with security best
13:20 - practices is not misconfigured does not
13:23 - have any security vulnerabilities that
13:25 - can be exploited and so on so because of
13:27 - the sheer number of of containers and
13:29 - applications it's just hard to keep
13:31 - track and have an overview of security
13:35 - status in all of them and again that's
13:37 - where AI tools that have the capability
13:40 - of analyzing large sets of data really
13:43 - fast can be useful and that's what CTIC
13:46 - does basically it will automatically go
13:48 - through the entire environment it will
13:50 - detect analyze and it will highlight any
13:53 - potential security threats that it
13:55 - detected in your systems and cytic
13:58 - actually has this visualization tool
14:01 - that will show you a path and a tech
14:04 - would take from its entry point all the
14:07 - way to the sensitive data and again we
14:09 - have the same issue here because once an
14:11 - issue is detected now the engineers will
14:14 - have to identify the root cause of that
14:16 - issue so that they can fix it so
14:19 - troubleshooting and digging through tons
14:20 - of data or logs is definitely going to
14:23 - be challenging so tools like cytic do
14:26 - this kind of troubleshooting and
14:28 - Analysis in addition to identifying
14:30 - issues and it tells you exactly where
14:32 - the issue originates from and how it can
14:35 - be fixed and again this can be super
14:37 - helpful and save Engineers a ton of time
14:40 - in troubleshooting the issues and one
14:43 - last interesting thing about cytic is
14:45 - that they actually introduced an AI
14:48 - workload security feature which
14:50 - basically means that the AI workload
14:53 - itself that is deployed in kubernetes
14:56 - cluster for example can have lots of
14:58 - security vulnerabil ilities in fact they
15:00 - detected that over 30% of deployed
15:04 - generative AI workloads that were
15:06 - running in comm's cluster were publicly
15:09 - exposed which means people could
15:11 - actually interact with that AI tool from
15:14 - outside and get a lot of sensitive data
15:16 - in the output so they designed this
15:18 - feature specifically to monitor security
15:22 - for AI workloads running in
15:24 - containerized environments another
15:27 - category of AI tools that are also an
15:29 - interesting use case especially in the
15:32 - cloud space are tools that help you
15:35 - manage your resources on cloud
15:38 - efficiently and save Cloud costs and
15:41 - again this could be a really challenging
15:43 - thing to do when you're applications and
15:46 - your deployment environment scale when
15:48 - you have lots of services running in
15:50 - your environment when you're using a lot
15:51 - of Services of the cloud provider in
15:54 - your applications for convenience or
15:57 - when you're using multicloud and so on
15:59 - and there are AI tools like Cloud health
16:03 - or usage AI or cast Ai and they give you
16:06 - an overview of how efficiently you are
16:09 - using the infrastructure resources as
16:11 - well as recommendations of how you can
16:14 - optimize the usage and save cost for
16:17 - example what type or size of instances
16:19 - you can be running which instances that
16:22 - you running are underutilized or not
16:25 - used at all plus they use the predictive
16:28 - analysis to provide you with information
16:31 - about how much infrastructure or how
16:33 - many instances for example you would
16:34 - need but this of course Works only for
16:36 - workloads that are more predictable
16:38 - based on that it can also give you
16:40 - recommendations on scaling your
16:42 - environment based on usage patterns and
16:46 - to basically help you avoid unnecessary
16:48 - costs of using resources that you don't
16:51 - actually need or you won't need as much
16:53 - in the future and again it's really
16:55 - important for these tools to actually
16:56 - support multicloud because lot of
16:59 - applications a lot of complex
17:00 - applications today are running on
17:02 - multicloud environments so having an
17:04 - overview of your workloads across the
17:07 - cloud platforms is also an important use
17:10 - case so I believe currently these are
17:12 - some of the most important use cases of
17:15 - AI Tools in devops and Cloud
17:17 - specifically and as I mentioned at the
17:19 - beginning I generally think that AI
17:21 - tools right now are not mature enough to
17:26 - really fulfill these ambitious prom of
17:29 - us Engineers just focusing on this big
17:32 - picture and high level logic and the AI
17:34 - tool just does all the technical heavy
17:36 - lifting in the background for us because
17:39 - that's actually not the case yet even
17:42 - though they have tremendous capabilities
17:44 - and they are able to process and analyze
17:47 - massive sets of data and do Predictive
17:50 - Analytics and so on right now there are
17:53 - still just another set of tools that you
17:57 - as an engineer need to have under your
17:59 - tool belt that means the technical
18:02 - expertise and the technical knowhow
18:05 - behind devops and Cloud all the concepts
18:07 - and Technologies is still very much
18:10 - needed because AI tools cannot replace
18:13 - them yet however as I mentioned in use
18:16 - cases such as automated monitoring or
18:18 - security enhancement because of just the
18:21 - sheer volume of components and workloads
18:25 - that we are running in modern systems
18:28 - these kind of AI tools can massively
18:30 - increase our productivity and save us a
18:33 - lot of time so we can actually focus on
18:36 - more exciting engineering but still
18:39 - technical tasks I hope I was able to
18:41 - give you a valuable overview of AI tools
18:45 - for devops and Cloud use cases I would
18:47 - really love to hear from you what other
18:49 - AI tools are using in your devops or
18:52 - Cloud projects and what are your
18:53 - experiences with them and I'm sure it's
18:55 - going to be really interesting for all
18:57 - the other viewers so please share them
18:59 - Below in the comments and with that
19:01 - thank you for watching and see you in
19:03 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

AI is the hottest topic right now and AI tools are being developed for all areas including different it Fields And since you are on the tech world with Nana Channel we will be talking about the AI tools specifically for devops and Cloud use cases to make it more interesting and valuable for you I decided to focus on categories of AI tools like monitoring security Improvement and so on instead of just comparing random or most popular AI Tools Plus I'm going to give you my honest experience of using these tools in my actual devops projects and explain why I'm not the biggest fan of AI tools right now and just a heads up none of the tools I cover in these categories are sponsored plus you know my motto which is Concepts before tools so all examples are from my practical experience in my engineering projects and my additional extensive research that I do for each video and if there is a sponsored mention of a tool I will explicitly highlight that in the video for example later in this video I'm going to announce a sponsor because I'm very proud of few awesome tech companies that we work with and by the way recently we saw that 70% of you who watch our videos are still unsubscribed if you received value from any of our videos be sure to subscribe so you don't miss any new content we put out out here and by the way in the comments you can also make suggestions about which tools or which tutorials you want us to create and post here with that out of the way let's get to it devops is all about Automation and efficiency right whether we want to release a new feature fast or secure our infrastructure or monitor our platform and prevent any issues in time as part of devop principles all these should be and can be automated so imagine a scenario where AI is helping take over the tedious repetitive tasks help automate things and help engineers make databased decisions this means super fast code validations proactive support in case some issues happen on your Cloud infrastructure or commence cluster automatically detecting security threats and super quick response to incidents all driven by the power of AI now if this sounds too good to be true well because it is most AI tools right now aren't mature enough to use them on autopilot right now you need to use them like any other tool they can't do everything automatically for you in fact many of them still need a lot of human review and validation but that doesn't mean that they are useless there are still some really good use cases for AI tools right now now the obvious one we all know is cat gbt which I'm not going to talk about here because it's much more general purpose it's not specific for devops plus I actually have two videos on chbt with extensive use cases so you can check them out here but even though you may be getting by with C GPT for now these kind of tools have many limitations when it comes to devops and Cloud specifically when we think about devops and all these automations and Cloud platforms with so many services it's always about integrating various tools together to build these automated processes right like you need to automate monitoring in your cluster and automatically notify teams of any abnormal behavior you want to automate detecting security issues or you want to help automate the provisioning of infrastructure and generally the integration of various tools together and by the way if you haven't already you can download our complete devops road map which I created to give a good structured overview of all the elements of devil in exactly the right sequence to understand the complete flow you can grab the tech Devils road map directly on our website for completely free because I believe everybody should have access to this important knowledge I will leave the link to it in the video description so go grab it from there so what are the use cases of AI in devops and Cloud the first category we have is the AI code assistants and the main use case for such tools is in writing infrastructure as code or configuration as code and so on a popular example here is GitHub copilot and there are lots of very similar tools that basically do the same they are your code assistant within the code editor or IDE so they help you with code suggestions code completions basically they predict what you want to code based on the current context and suggest that code for you or you can ask specifically to give you code piece or entire code block by simply typing the logic in English and it will give you a respective code for that functionality you can even ask it to refactor a code block or clean up the code find any code duplications any dirty code so to say and also interesting use case is you can ask it any explanation on the application code or Improvement suggestions so for example if you're a junior engineer trying to figure out what the terraform code in your new project does you can use an AI assistant to understand the code so you can use it to actually learn and become better at the infrastructure as code tool that your new team is working with now the limitation of such tools based on my experience of using various such AI code assistants for my devop projects is that the code they generate is usually not entirely usable so you still need to validate the output before you can use it or in most cases you have to fix the output because output of the tool simply doesn't work so sometimes you have to double check with the official documentation and so on I actually did a separate video on GitHub copilot and the entire overview here and as I said there are many other AI code assistants out there like Amazon Q which I also covered so you can learn more on those tools and some interesting use cases about them of how to use them as a devops engineer in those videos now code assistants are useful when you can use it directly in your code editor while actually writing the code so you don't have to switch between your code editor and internet browser to use those tools so all these tools have this feature to be integrated in any popular editor or IDE like Visual Studio code or intellig Etc and interesting to point out that there is even an AI powered code editor like cursor where the editor itself has the AI integration so it gives you a lot of the additional features to AI code assistance as part of the editor itself now most of the functionality is very comparable to the AI code assistants but the main advantage here is that the editor the cursor editor is actually able to understand the project context better to give you more precise code suggestions or answers to your code related questions the next one is actually a use case which I think is much more useful than AI code assistance for devops and cloudspace which is AI powered monitoring tools monitoring in devops and cloud is a really complex thing that absolutely needs to be automated when you have very complex systems with thousands of servers and tens of thousands of components on those servers you can't do observability manually you have to automated and alert proactively when the services and applications in your system system behave abnormally because you can be sitting in front of the dashboard or manually checking that all your services are running properly but configuring automated monitoring and alerting is actually a pretty challenging task so this is where monitoring AI tools may be useful one popular such tool is data Do's Watchdog so Watchdog is part of the data dog platform so it's basically like a builtin intelligence layer that continuously analyzes billions of data points from your infrastructure to applications to the underlying platform to find the issues proactively and help you resolve them quickly and the good thing is that data doc also has a feature that basically kind of digs into the issue to identify what actually caused that issue because once the issue is identified the troubleshooting part alone can take a lot of time to exactly pinpoint which one of your thousands of components in your systems actually caused that abnormal behavior or that error so again by analyzing the data about how the services are connected to each other how they correlate how they behave it can pinpoint exactly where the issue is coming from so again you can save yourself manual effort on troubleshooting and fighting root cause of the issue and one more thing which is also very important is is what's called Predictive Analytics it basically means that by analyzing previous data on all the abnormal behavior that has happened and identifying any Trends it can actually tell you if there are any potential issues that may happen in the future and as I said this is much more interesting use case because this is exactly the strength of an AI that it can analyze large sets of historical data as well as analyze the data for correlations between the systems between the services and applications and find the exact issues as well as predict any potential issues before they happen now at the heart of devops are cic City pipelines right that's where a lot of devops Automation and optimization work is done and one of the cicd tools that really focuses on saving time of the developers and optimizing the release workflow is team City pipelines from jet brains who is a sponsor of this entire video so big shout out to Jet brains for supporting our channel so we can create valuable devops tutorials like this one I've used the team City pipelines already and what stood out for me is the main focus on developer productivity by providing selftuning pipelines which have basically builtin pipeline optimization options so while you're building and configuring the PIP line in the team City pipelines tool the platform itself guides you with builin intelligent suggestions of how to optimize your pipeline and because of that the biggest convenience for me was that I don't have to switch back and forth to some documentation and back to the tool to configure various details of the pipeline like adding caching or running jobs in parallel to speed up pipeline execution and so on now if you know me you know I I don't like configuring things in UI everything needs to be scripted as per devops best practices everything is code right so the way I used team City pipelines myself is I configure the pipeline via the tool in the UI using its selftuning features and once I'm done I can save the pipeline configuration and it will automatically save the yl configuration of my pipeline in my git repository simple as that as always I will leave all the relevant links in the video description and you can actually try out team City pipelines for free now on to the next AI tool for devops another interesting use case is security Centric tools specifically tools that can prevent any security issues before they happen by doing Security checks and discovering any security vulnerabilities based on statistical data or abnormal behavior detected in the systems there are some security AI tools that even allow operations team to configure autof fixes when security issues or misconfigurations are detected so the tool itself will find and fix the security issue before it can get exploited one popular tool in this category is Cystic which similar to data dog uses machine learning and advanced analytics to give you proactive monitoring of large complex systems especially in containerized environments and we know in today's devops world containers are a standard you may have thousands of containers running different services and your applications on multiple environments and imagine if you have thousands of containers on different systems how hard it is to make sure that each container and each service within that container is actually running with security best practices is not misconfigured does not have any security vulnerabilities that can be exploited and so on so because of the sheer number of of containers and applications it's just hard to keep track and have an overview of security status in all of them and again that's where AI tools that have the capability of analyzing large sets of data really fast can be useful and that's what CTIC does basically it will automatically go through the entire environment it will detect analyze and it will highlight any potential security threats that it detected in your systems and cytic actually has this visualization tool that will show you a path and a tech would take from its entry point all the way to the sensitive data and again we have the same issue here because once an issue is detected now the engineers will have to identify the root cause of that issue so that they can fix it so troubleshooting and digging through tons of data or logs is definitely going to be challenging so tools like cytic do this kind of troubleshooting and Analysis in addition to identifying issues and it tells you exactly where the issue originates from and how it can be fixed and again this can be super helpful and save Engineers a ton of time in troubleshooting the issues and one last interesting thing about cytic is that they actually introduced an AI workload security feature which basically means that the AI workload itself that is deployed in kubernetes cluster for example can have lots of security vulnerabil ilities in fact they detected that over 30% of deployed generative AI workloads that were running in comm's cluster were publicly exposed which means people could actually interact with that AI tool from outside and get a lot of sensitive data in the output so they designed this feature specifically to monitor security for AI workloads running in containerized environments another category of AI tools that are also an interesting use case especially in the cloud space are tools that help you manage your resources on cloud efficiently and save Cloud costs and again this could be a really challenging thing to do when you're applications and your deployment environment scale when you have lots of services running in your environment when you're using a lot of Services of the cloud provider in your applications for convenience or when you're using multicloud and so on and there are AI tools like Cloud health or usage AI or cast Ai and they give you an overview of how efficiently you are using the infrastructure resources as well as recommendations of how you can optimize the usage and save cost for example what type or size of instances you can be running which instances that you running are underutilized or not used at all plus they use the predictive analysis to provide you with information about how much infrastructure or how many instances for example you would need but this of course Works only for workloads that are more predictable based on that it can also give you recommendations on scaling your environment based on usage patterns and to basically help you avoid unnecessary costs of using resources that you don't actually need or you won't need as much in the future and again it's really important for these tools to actually support multicloud because lot of applications a lot of complex applications today are running on multicloud environments so having an overview of your workloads across the cloud platforms is also an important use case so I believe currently these are some of the most important use cases of AI Tools in devops and Cloud specifically and as I mentioned at the beginning I generally think that AI tools right now are not mature enough to really fulfill these ambitious prom of us Engineers just focusing on this big picture and high level logic and the AI tool just does all the technical heavy lifting in the background for us because that's actually not the case yet even though they have tremendous capabilities and they are able to process and analyze massive sets of data and do Predictive Analytics and so on right now there are still just another set of tools that you as an engineer need to have under your tool belt that means the technical expertise and the technical knowhow behind devops and Cloud all the concepts and Technologies is still very much needed because AI tools cannot replace them yet however as I mentioned in use cases such as automated monitoring or security enhancement because of just the sheer volume of components and workloads that we are running in modern systems these kind of AI tools can massively increase our productivity and save us a lot of time so we can actually focus on more exciting engineering but still technical tasks I hope I was able to give you a valuable overview of AI tools for devops and Cloud use cases I would really love to hear from you what other AI tools are using in your devops or Cloud projects and what are your experiences with them and I'm sure it's going to be really interesting for all the other viewers so please share them Below in the comments and with that thank you for watching and see you in the next video
