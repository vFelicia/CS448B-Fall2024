With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video we're gonna talk about
00:01 - what ingress is and how you should use
00:05 - it and also what are different use cases
00:07 - for ingress so first of all let's
00:15 - imagine a simple kubernetes cluster
00:17 - where we have a part of my application
00:20 - and it's corresponding service my app
00:24 - service so the first thing you need for
00:25 - a UI application is to be accessible
00:28 - through a browser right so for external
00:30 - requests to be able to reach your
00:33 - application so one way to do that an
00:37 - easy way is through an external service
00:38 - where basically you can access the
00:41 - application using HTTP protocol the IP
00:44 - address of the node in the port however
00:48 - this is good for test cases and if you
00:52 - want to try something very fast but this
00:55 - is not what the final product should
00:57 - look like the final product should be
00:58 - like this so you have a domain name for
01:01 - application and you want a secure
01:03 - connection using HTTPS so the way to do
01:06 - that is using commander this component
01:08 - called ingress so you'll have my app
01:11 - ingress and instead of external service
01:14 - you would instead have an internal
01:17 - service so you would not open your
01:19 - application through the IP address and
01:21 - the port and now if the request comes
01:24 - from the browser it's gonna first reach
01:27 - to the ingress and ingress then we'll
01:28 - redirect it to the internal service and
01:30 - then it will eventually end up with the
01:33 - pot so now let's actually take a look
01:35 - and see how external service
01:37 - configuration looks like so that you
01:39 - have a practical understanding so first
01:42 - of all if you want to know in more
01:44 - details how Cabrera's llamó files are
01:46 - written and what the syntax looks like
01:48 - for different components then I have a
01:50 - separate video so you can check it out
01:52 - but here to just to understand the main
01:55 - concepts so you have the service which
01:57 - is of type load balancer this means we
02:00 - are opening it to public by assigning an
02:03 - external IP address to the service and
02:05 - this is the port number that user can
02:09 - access the application at so basically
02:12 - IP address
02:13 - the external IP address and the port
02:15 - number that you specify here again if
02:18 - you want to know more details about each
02:20 - attribute then check out my kubernetes
02:23 - GML video now with ingress of course it
02:28 - looks differently so let's go through
02:30 - the syntax of ingress basically have a
02:32 - kind ingress instead of a service and in
02:35 - the specification where the whole
02:37 - configuration happens you have so-called
02:40 - rules or routing rules and this
02:43 - basically defines that in the main
02:45 - address or all the requests to that host
02:48 - must be forwarded to an internal service
02:52 - so this is the host that user will enter
02:55 - in the browser and in ingress use define
02:58 - a mapping so what happens when that
03:00 - requests or that host gets issued you
03:03 - redirect it internally to a service the
03:06 - path here basically means the URL path
03:09 - so everything after the domain name so
03:12 - slash whatever path comes after that you
03:15 - can define those rules here and we'll
03:17 - see some different examples of the path
03:20 - configuration later and as you see here
03:22 - in this configuration we have an HTTP
03:25 - protocol so later in this video I'm
03:29 - gonna show you how to configure HTTP
03:31 - connection using English component so
03:34 - right now in the specification we don't
03:36 - have anything configured for the secure
03:39 - connection it's just ad HTTP and one
03:41 - thing to note here is that this HTTP
03:44 - attribute here does not correspond to
03:46 - this one here this is a protocol that
03:49 - the incoming request gets forwarded to
03:53 - to the internal service so this is
03:55 - actually the second step and not to
03:58 - confuse it with this one and now let's
04:00 - see how the internal service to that
04:03 - ingress will look like so basically back
04:06 - end is the targets where the request the
04:09 - incoming request will be redirected and
04:11 - the service name should correspond the
04:14 - internal service name like this and the
04:16 - port should be internal service port and
04:20 - as you see here the only difference
04:22 - between the external and internal
04:23 - services is that here in internal
04:26 - service I don't have
04:27 - the third ports which is the note ports
04:29 - starting from 30 thousands we now have
04:31 - that attribute here and the type is a
04:34 - default type not a load balancer but
04:36 - internal service type which is cluster
04:38 - IP so this should be a valid domain
04:42 - address so you can just write anything
04:44 - here it has to be first of all valid and
04:46 - you should map that domain name to IP
04:50 - address of the node that represents an
04:54 - entry point to your kubernetes cluster
04:55 - so for example if you decide that one of
04:58 - the nodes inside the kubernetes cluster
05:00 - is going to be the entry point then you
05:03 - should map this to the IP address of
05:05 - that note or and we will see that later
05:08 - if you configure a server outside of the
05:10 - kubernetes cluster that will become the
05:13 - entry points to your kubernetes cluster
05:15 - then you should map this hostname to the
05:18 - IP address of that server so now that we
05:21 - saw what kubernetes ingress components
05:24 - looks like let's see how to actually
05:25 - configure ingress in the cluster so
05:29 - remember this diagram I showed you the
05:31 - beginning so basically you have a pod
05:33 - service and corresponding ingress now if
05:37 - you create that ingress components alone
05:40 - that won't be enough for ingress routing
05:45 - rules to work what you need in addition
05:47 - is an implementation for ingress and
05:50 - that implementation is called ingress
05:52 - controller so the step one will be to
05:54 - install an ingress controllers which is
05:57 - basically another pod or another set of
06:00 - parts that run on your note in your
06:03 - kubernetes cluster and thus evaluation
06:06 - and processing of ingress routes so the
06:09 - yellow file that I showed you with the
06:11 - ingress component is basically this part
06:15 - right here and this has to be
06:17 - additionally installed in components
06:19 - cluster so what is ingress controller
06:22 - exactly the function of ingress
06:25 - controller is to evaluate all the rules
06:28 - that you have defined in your cluster
06:29 - and this way to manage all the
06:32 - redirections so basically this will be
06:34 - the entry point in the cluster for all
06:37 - the requests to that domain or
06:40 - the main rules that you've configured
06:42 - and this will evaluate all the rules
06:45 - because you may have 50 rules or 50
06:47 - ingress components created in your
06:49 - cluster it will evaluate all the rules
06:52 - and decide based on that which
06:54 - forwarding rule applies for that
06:57 - specific request so in order to install
06:59 - this implementation of ingress in your
07:02 - cluster you have to decide which one of
07:05 - many different third-party
07:06 - implementations you want to choose from
07:09 - I'll put a link of the holism
07:11 - description where you see different
07:13 - kinds of English controllers you can
07:15 - choose from there is one from kubernetes
07:18 - itself which is kubernetes nginx ingress
07:20 - controller but there are others as well
07:22 - so once we install ingress controller in
07:25 - your cluster you're good to go
07:27 - create ingress rules and the whole
07:30 - configuration is gonna work so now that
07:32 - I've shown you how ingress can be used
07:35 - in a Cabana this cluster there is one
07:37 - thing that I think is important to
07:39 - understand in terms of setting up the
07:41 - whole cluster to be able to receive
07:44 - external requests now first of all you
07:47 - have to consider the environment where
07:49 - you come in at these cluster is running
07:51 - if you are using some cloud service
07:54 - provider like Amazon Web Services Google
07:57 - cloud lino there are a couple more that
08:00 - have out-of-the-box coronated solutions
08:03 - or they have their own virtualized load
08:06 - balances etc your cluster configuration
08:09 - would look something like this
08:11 - so you would have a cloud load balancer
08:14 - that is specifically implemented by that
08:16 - cloud provider and external requests
08:20 - coming from the browser will first hit
08:22 - the load balancer and that load balancer
08:26 - then will redirect the requests to
08:28 - ingress controller now this is not the
08:31 - only way to do it even in cloud
08:33 - environment you can do it in a couple of
08:35 - different ways but this is one of the
08:37 - most common strategies an advantage of
08:40 - using cloud provided for that is that
08:43 - you don't have to implement a load
08:46 - balancer yourself so with minimal effort
08:50 - probably on most cloud providers you
08:52 - will have the load balancer up and run
08:54 - and ready to receive those requests and
08:57 - forward those requests into your
08:59 - cabinets cluster so very easy setup now
09:02 - if you are deploying your humanities
09:05 - cluster on a bare metal environment then
09:08 - you would have to do that part yourself
09:11 - so basically you would have to configure
09:12 - some kind of entry point to your
09:14 - cabinets cluster yourself and there's a
09:17 - whole list of different ways to do that
09:18 - and I'm gonna put that also in the
09:20 - description
09:20 - but generally speaking either inside of
09:24 - a cluster or outside is a separate
09:27 - server you will have to provide an entry
09:31 - point and one of those types is an
09:34 - external proxy server which can be a
09:37 - software or hardware solution that will
09:41 - take a role of that load balancer in an
09:43 - entry point to your cluster so basically
09:47 - what this would mean is that you will
09:49 - have a separate server and you would
09:52 - give this a public IP address and you
09:54 - would open the ports in order for the
09:56 - requests to be accepted and this proxy
10:00 - server then will act as an entry point
10:03 - to your cluster so this will be the only
10:05 - one accessible externally so none of the
10:09 - servers in your kubernetes cluster will
10:10 - have publicly accessible IP address
10:13 - which is obviously a very good security
10:15 - practice so all the requests will enter
10:18 - the proxy server and that will then
10:21 - redirect the request to ingress
10:22 - controller and English controller will
10:25 - then decide which ingress rule applies
10:28 - to that specific request and the whole
10:31 - internal request forwarding will happen
10:33 - so as I said there are different ways to
10:36 - configure that and to set it up
10:39 - depending on which environment you are
10:40 - and also which approach you choose but I
10:43 - think it's a very important concept to
10:45 - understand how the whole cluster setup
10:47 - works so in my case since I'm using mini
10:51 - cube to demonstrate all this on my
10:53 - laptop the setup will be pretty easy and
10:56 - even though this might not apply exactly
10:58 - to your cluster setting still you will
11:00 - see in practice how all these things
11:02 - work so the first thing is to install
11:05 - ingress controller in mini cube and the
11:07 - way to do that is
11:08 - by executing mini cube add-ons enable
11:13 - ingress so what this does is
11:15 - automatically configures or
11:18 - automatically starts the kubernetes
11:20 - nginx implementation of ingress
11:23 - controller so that's one of the many
11:25 - third-party implementations which you
11:27 - can also safely use in production
11:29 - environments not just mini cube but this
11:32 - is what mini cube actually offers you
11:34 - out of the box so with one simple
11:37 - command ingress controller will be
11:39 - configured in your cluster and if you do
11:42 - cube CT I'll get pod in a cube system
11:45 - namespace you will see the nginx ingress
11:47 - controller pod running in your cluster
11:50 - so once I have English controller
11:51 - installed now I can create an ingress
11:54 - rule that the controller can evaluate so
11:57 - let's actually head over to the command
11:59 - line where I'm gonna create ingress rule
12:01 - for kubernetes dashboard component so in
12:04 - my mini cube cluster
12:05 - I have kubernetes dashboard which is
12:09 - right now not accessible externally so
12:12 - what I'm gonna do is since I already
12:14 - have internal service for kubernetes
12:16 - dashboard and a pod for that I'm gonna
12:20 - configure an ingress rule for the
12:23 - dashboard so I can access it from a
12:25 - browser using some domain name so I'm
12:30 - gonna so this shows me all the
12:34 - components that I have in CONUS
12:36 - dashboard and since I already have
12:38 - internal service for kubernetes
12:40 - dashboard in the pod that's running I
12:43 - can now create an ingress rule in order
12:47 - to access my kubernetes dashboard using
12:50 - some hostname so let's go ahead and do
12:52 - that so I'm gonna create an ingress for
12:56 - Communities dashboard so these are just
12:59 - metadata the name it's gonna be
13:01 - dashboard ingress and the namespace it's
13:03 - gonna be in the same namespace as a
13:05 - service and pod so in the specification
13:08 - we are gonna define the rules so the
13:12 - first rule is the hostname I'm just
13:15 - gonna call I'm gonna define dashboard
13:19 - com
13:21 - and the HTTP forwarding to internal
13:25 - service path let's leave it at all path
13:30 - and this is the back end of the service
13:33 - so service name will be what we saw here
13:37 - so this is the service name and service
13:42 - port is what the service listens so this
13:49 - is actually 80 right here and this will
13:52 - be it that's the ingress configuration
13:54 - for forwarding every request that is
13:59 - directed to dashboard comm to internal
14:03 - kubernetes dashboard service and we know
14:05 - it's internal because its type is
14:06 - cluster IP so no external IP address so
14:10 - obviously I just made up host name
14:13 - dashboard comm it's not registered
14:16 - anywhere and I also didn't configure
14:19 - anywhere which IP address this host name
14:23 - should resolve to and this is something
14:25 - that you will always have to configure
14:26 - so first of all let's actually create
14:29 - that ingress rule
14:30 - so keep CTL apply and it's called
14:35 - dashboard ingress mo see English was
14:41 - created so if I do get increase in the
14:46 - name space I should see my ingress here
14:51 - and as you see address is now empty
14:54 - because it takes a little bit of time to
14:56 - assign the address to ingress so we'll
15:01 - have to wait for that to get the IP
15:03 - address that will map to this host so
15:07 - I'm just gonna watch this and it's I see
15:11 - that address was assigned so what I'm
15:14 - gonna do now is that I'm gonna take that
15:16 - address and in my if you see hosts file
15:26 - at the end I'm gonna define that mapping
15:29 - so that IP address will be mapped to
15:33 - dashboard comm and again this works
15:37 - locally if I'm gonna type dashboard calm
15:39 - in the browser this will be the IP
15:41 - address that it's gonna be mapped to
15:45 - which basically means that the request
15:48 - will come in to my mini cube cluster
15:50 - will be handed over to English
15:52 - controller and English controller then
15:55 - we'll go and evaluate this rule that
15:56 - I've defined here and forward that
15:59 - request to service so this is all the
16:02 - configuration we need so now I'm gonna
16:04 - go and and enter dashboard comm and I
16:11 - will see my kubernetes dashboard here so
16:15 - embrace also has something called a
16:17 - default back-end so if I do cube CTL
16:20 - describe ingress the name of the ingress
16:27 - in the namespace
16:31 - I'll get this output and here there is
16:36 - an attribute called default back-end
16:38 - that maps to default HTTP back-end port
16:43 - 80 so what this means is that whenever a
16:46 - request comes into the communities
16:48 - cluster that is not mapped to any
16:50 - back-end so there is no rule for mapping
16:53 - the request 20 to a service then this
16:57 - default back-end is used to handle that
17:01 - request so obviously if you don't have
17:04 - this service created or defined in your
17:08 - cluster
17:08 - kubernetes will try to forward it to the
17:11 - service it won't find it and you would
17:13 - get some default error response so for
17:17 - example if I entered some path that I
17:21 - haven't configured I just get page not
17:24 - found so a good usage for that is to
17:27 - define custom error messages when pages
17:30 - and found when request comes in that you
17:33 - can handle or the application can handle
17:35 - so that users still sees meaningful
17:38 - error message or
17:40 - just the custom page where you can
17:41 - redirect them to your home page or
17:43 - something like this so all you have to
17:45 - do is create an internal service with
17:48 - the same name so default they should be
17:50 - back-end and the port number and also
17:54 - create a pod or application that sends
17:58 - that error custom error message response
18:01 - so till now I have shown you what
18:03 - ingress is and how you can use it I've
18:06 - also shown you a demo of how to create
18:07 - an ingress rule in mini cube but we've
18:11 - used only very basic ingress ml
18:14 - configuration just a simple forwarding
18:17 - to one internal service with one path
18:21 - but you can do much more with ingress
18:24 - configuration than just basic forwarding
18:28 - and in the next section we'll gonna go
18:31 - through more use cases of how you can
18:34 - define more fine granular routing for
18:37 - applications inside kubernetes cluster
18:39 - so the first thing is defining multiple
18:43 - paths of the same host so consider
18:47 - following use case Google has one domain
18:51 - but has many services that it offers so
18:54 - for example if you have a Google account
18:56 - you can use its analytics you can use it
18:59 - shopping you have a calendar you have a
19:01 - Gmail etc so all of these are separate
19:04 - applications that are accessible with
19:07 - the same domain so consider you have an
19:10 - application that does something similar
19:12 - so you offer two separate applications
19:15 - they're part of the same ecosystem but
19:18 - you still want to have them on separate
19:21 - URLs so what you can do is that in rules
19:24 - you can define the host which is my app
19:27 - calm and in the paths section you can
19:30 - define multiple paths so if user wants
19:33 - to access your analytics application
19:35 - then they have to enter my Abe comm
19:38 - slash analytics and that will forward
19:41 - the request to internal an analytic
19:43 - service and the pot or if they want to
19:46 - access the shopping application then the
19:49 - URL for that would be my F comm slash
19:52 - shopping
19:53 - so this way you can do forwarding with
19:56 - one ingress of the same host to multiple
19:59 - applications using multiple paths
20:01 - another use case is when instead of
20:05 - using URLs to make different
20:09 - applications accessible some companies
20:12 - use subdomains so instead of having my
20:15 - app comm slash analytics they create a
20:18 - subdomain analytics dot my app comm so
20:22 - if you have your application configured
20:24 - that way your configuration will look
20:27 - like this so instead of having one host
20:28 - like in the previous example and
20:30 - multiple paths here inside now you have
20:34 - multiple hosts where each host
20:36 - represents a subdomain and inside you
20:39 - just have one path that again redirects
20:42 - the request to analytic service pretty
20:44 - straightforward
20:45 - so now in the same request setting you
20:47 - have analytic service and a part behind
20:51 - it another request will look like this
20:54 - using a subdomain instead of path and
20:57 - one final topic that I mentioned that
21:00 - we'll cover here is configuring TLS
21:02 - certificate till now we've only seen
21:05 - ingress configuration for HTTP requests
21:08 - but it's super easy to configure HTTP
21:11 - forwarding in ingress so the only thing
21:14 - that you need to do is define attribute
21:17 - called TLS above the rules section with
21:20 - host which is the same host as right
21:22 - here and the secret name which is a
21:26 - reference of a secret that you have to
21:28 - create in a cluster that holds that TLS
21:31 - certificate so the secret configuration
21:34 - would look like this so the name is the
21:38 - reference right here and the data or the
21:41 - actual contents contain TLS certificate
21:44 - and TLS key if you've seen my other
21:47 - videos where I create different
21:49 - components like secret you probably
21:52 - notice the type additional type
21:54 - attribute here in kubernetes there is a
21:57 - specific type of a secret called TLS so
22:01 - I'll have to use that type when you
22:03 - create a TLS secret and there are three
22:06 - notes to me to be made here one is that
22:09 - the keys of this data have to be named
22:12 - exactly like that the values are the
22:16 - actual file contents of the certificate
22:18 - or key contents and not the file path or
22:21 - location so you have to put the whole
22:23 - content here basics before encode it and
22:26 - the third one is that you have to create
22:29 - the secret in the same namespace as the
22:32 - ingress component for it to be able to
22:34 - use that otherwise you can't reference a
22:37 - secret from another namespace and these
22:40 - four lines is all you need to configure
22:43 - mapping of an HTTP request to that host
22:47 - to internal service thanks for watching
22:50 - the video I hope it was helpful and if
22:52 - it was don't forget to like it if you
22:54 - want to be notified whenever a new video
22:56 - comes out then subscribe to my channel
22:58 - if you have any questions if something
23:01 - wasn't clear in the video please post
23:03 - them in the comment section below and I
23:05 - will try to answer them so thank you and

so in this video we're gonna talk about what ingress is and how you should use it and also what are different use cases for ingress so first of all let's imagine a simple kubernetes cluster where we have a part of my application and it's corresponding service my app service so the first thing you need for a UI application is to be accessible through a browser right so for external requests to be able to reach your application so one way to do that an easy way is through an external service where basically you can access the application using HTTP protocol the IP address of the node in the port however this is good for test cases and if you want to try something very fast but this is not what the final product should look like the final product should be like this so you have a domain name for application and you want a secure connection using HTTPS so the way to do that is using commander this component called ingress so you'll have my app ingress and instead of external service you would instead have an internal service so you would not open your application through the IP address and the port and now if the request comes from the browser it's gonna first reach to the ingress and ingress then we'll redirect it to the internal service and then it will eventually end up with the pot so now let's actually take a look and see how external service configuration looks like so that you have a practical understanding so first of all if you want to know in more details how Cabrera's llamó files are written and what the syntax looks like for different components then I have a separate video so you can check it out but here to just to understand the main concepts so you have the service which is of type load balancer this means we are opening it to public by assigning an external IP address to the service and this is the port number that user can access the application at so basically IP address the external IP address and the port number that you specify here again if you want to know more details about each attribute then check out my kubernetes GML video now with ingress of course it looks differently so let's go through the syntax of ingress basically have a kind ingress instead of a service and in the specification where the whole configuration happens you have socalled rules or routing rules and this basically defines that in the main address or all the requests to that host must be forwarded to an internal service so this is the host that user will enter in the browser and in ingress use define a mapping so what happens when that requests or that host gets issued you redirect it internally to a service the path here basically means the URL path so everything after the domain name so slash whatever path comes after that you can define those rules here and we'll see some different examples of the path configuration later and as you see here in this configuration we have an HTTP protocol so later in this video I'm gonna show you how to configure HTTP connection using English component so right now in the specification we don't have anything configured for the secure connection it's just ad HTTP and one thing to note here is that this HTTP attribute here does not correspond to this one here this is a protocol that the incoming request gets forwarded to to the internal service so this is actually the second step and not to confuse it with this one and now let's see how the internal service to that ingress will look like so basically back end is the targets where the request the incoming request will be redirected and the service name should correspond the internal service name like this and the port should be internal service port and as you see here the only difference between the external and internal services is that here in internal service I don't have the third ports which is the note ports starting from 30 thousands we now have that attribute here and the type is a default type not a load balancer but internal service type which is cluster IP so this should be a valid domain address so you can just write anything here it has to be first of all valid and you should map that domain name to IP address of the node that represents an entry point to your kubernetes cluster so for example if you decide that one of the nodes inside the kubernetes cluster is going to be the entry point then you should map this to the IP address of that note or and we will see that later if you configure a server outside of the kubernetes cluster that will become the entry points to your kubernetes cluster then you should map this hostname to the IP address of that server so now that we saw what kubernetes ingress components looks like let's see how to actually configure ingress in the cluster so remember this diagram I showed you the beginning so basically you have a pod service and corresponding ingress now if you create that ingress components alone that won't be enough for ingress routing rules to work what you need in addition is an implementation for ingress and that implementation is called ingress controller so the step one will be to install an ingress controllers which is basically another pod or another set of parts that run on your note in your kubernetes cluster and thus evaluation and processing of ingress routes so the yellow file that I showed you with the ingress component is basically this part right here and this has to be additionally installed in components cluster so what is ingress controller exactly the function of ingress controller is to evaluate all the rules that you have defined in your cluster and this way to manage all the redirections so basically this will be the entry point in the cluster for all the requests to that domain or the main rules that you've configured and this will evaluate all the rules because you may have 50 rules or 50 ingress components created in your cluster it will evaluate all the rules and decide based on that which forwarding rule applies for that specific request so in order to install this implementation of ingress in your cluster you have to decide which one of many different thirdparty implementations you want to choose from I'll put a link of the holism description where you see different kinds of English controllers you can choose from there is one from kubernetes itself which is kubernetes nginx ingress controller but there are others as well so once we install ingress controller in your cluster you're good to go create ingress rules and the whole configuration is gonna work so now that I've shown you how ingress can be used in a Cabana this cluster there is one thing that I think is important to understand in terms of setting up the whole cluster to be able to receive external requests now first of all you have to consider the environment where you come in at these cluster is running if you are using some cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services Google cloud lino there are a couple more that have outofthebox coronated solutions or they have their own virtualized load balances etc your cluster configuration would look something like this so you would have a cloud load balancer that is specifically implemented by that cloud provider and external requests coming from the browser will first hit the load balancer and that load balancer then will redirect the requests to ingress controller now this is not the only way to do it even in cloud environment you can do it in a couple of different ways but this is one of the most common strategies an advantage of using cloud provided for that is that you don't have to implement a load balancer yourself so with minimal effort probably on most cloud providers you will have the load balancer up and run and ready to receive those requests and forward those requests into your cabinets cluster so very easy setup now if you are deploying your humanities cluster on a bare metal environment then you would have to do that part yourself so basically you would have to configure some kind of entry point to your cabinets cluster yourself and there's a whole list of different ways to do that and I'm gonna put that also in the description but generally speaking either inside of a cluster or outside is a separate server you will have to provide an entry point and one of those types is an external proxy server which can be a software or hardware solution that will take a role of that load balancer in an entry point to your cluster so basically what this would mean is that you will have a separate server and you would give this a public IP address and you would open the ports in order for the requests to be accepted and this proxy server then will act as an entry point to your cluster so this will be the only one accessible externally so none of the servers in your kubernetes cluster will have publicly accessible IP address which is obviously a very good security practice so all the requests will enter the proxy server and that will then redirect the request to ingress controller and English controller will then decide which ingress rule applies to that specific request and the whole internal request forwarding will happen so as I said there are different ways to configure that and to set it up depending on which environment you are and also which approach you choose but I think it's a very important concept to understand how the whole cluster setup works so in my case since I'm using mini cube to demonstrate all this on my laptop the setup will be pretty easy and even though this might not apply exactly to your cluster setting still you will see in practice how all these things work so the first thing is to install ingress controller in mini cube and the way to do that is by executing mini cube addons enable ingress so what this does is automatically configures or automatically starts the kubernetes nginx implementation of ingress controller so that's one of the many thirdparty implementations which you can also safely use in production environments not just mini cube but this is what mini cube actually offers you out of the box so with one simple command ingress controller will be configured in your cluster and if you do cube CT I'll get pod in a cube system namespace you will see the nginx ingress controller pod running in your cluster so once I have English controller installed now I can create an ingress rule that the controller can evaluate so let's actually head over to the command line where I'm gonna create ingress rule for kubernetes dashboard component so in my mini cube cluster I have kubernetes dashboard which is right now not accessible externally so what I'm gonna do is since I already have internal service for kubernetes dashboard and a pod for that I'm gonna configure an ingress rule for the dashboard so I can access it from a browser using some domain name so I'm gonna so this shows me all the components that I have in CONUS dashboard and since I already have internal service for kubernetes dashboard in the pod that's running I can now create an ingress rule in order to access my kubernetes dashboard using some hostname so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna create an ingress for Communities dashboard so these are just metadata the name it's gonna be dashboard ingress and the namespace it's gonna be in the same namespace as a service and pod so in the specification we are gonna define the rules so the first rule is the hostname I'm just gonna call I'm gonna define dashboard com and the HTTP forwarding to internal service path let's leave it at all path and this is the back end of the service so service name will be what we saw here so this is the service name and service port is what the service listens so this is actually 80 right here and this will be it that's the ingress configuration for forwarding every request that is directed to dashboard comm to internal kubernetes dashboard service and we know it's internal because its type is cluster IP so no external IP address so obviously I just made up host name dashboard comm it's not registered anywhere and I also didn't configure anywhere which IP address this host name should resolve to and this is something that you will always have to configure so first of all let's actually create that ingress rule so keep CTL apply and it's called dashboard ingress mo see English was created so if I do get increase in the name space I should see my ingress here and as you see address is now empty because it takes a little bit of time to assign the address to ingress so we'll have to wait for that to get the IP address that will map to this host so I'm just gonna watch this and it's I see that address was assigned so what I'm gonna do now is that I'm gonna take that address and in my if you see hosts file at the end I'm gonna define that mapping so that IP address will be mapped to dashboard comm and again this works locally if I'm gonna type dashboard calm in the browser this will be the IP address that it's gonna be mapped to which basically means that the request will come in to my mini cube cluster will be handed over to English controller and English controller then we'll go and evaluate this rule that I've defined here and forward that request to service so this is all the configuration we need so now I'm gonna go and and enter dashboard comm and I will see my kubernetes dashboard here so embrace also has something called a default backend so if I do cube CTL describe ingress the name of the ingress in the namespace I'll get this output and here there is an attribute called default backend that maps to default HTTP backend port 80 so what this means is that whenever a request comes into the communities cluster that is not mapped to any backend so there is no rule for mapping the request 20 to a service then this default backend is used to handle that request so obviously if you don't have this service created or defined in your cluster kubernetes will try to forward it to the service it won't find it and you would get some default error response so for example if I entered some path that I haven't configured I just get page not found so a good usage for that is to define custom error messages when pages and found when request comes in that you can handle or the application can handle so that users still sees meaningful error message or just the custom page where you can redirect them to your home page or something like this so all you have to do is create an internal service with the same name so default they should be backend and the port number and also create a pod or application that sends that error custom error message response so till now I have shown you what ingress is and how you can use it I've also shown you a demo of how to create an ingress rule in mini cube but we've used only very basic ingress ml configuration just a simple forwarding to one internal service with one path but you can do much more with ingress configuration than just basic forwarding and in the next section we'll gonna go through more use cases of how you can define more fine granular routing for applications inside kubernetes cluster so the first thing is defining multiple paths of the same host so consider following use case Google has one domain but has many services that it offers so for example if you have a Google account you can use its analytics you can use it shopping you have a calendar you have a Gmail etc so all of these are separate applications that are accessible with the same domain so consider you have an application that does something similar so you offer two separate applications they're part of the same ecosystem but you still want to have them on separate URLs so what you can do is that in rules you can define the host which is my app calm and in the paths section you can define multiple paths so if user wants to access your analytics application then they have to enter my Abe comm slash analytics and that will forward the request to internal an analytic service and the pot or if they want to access the shopping application then the URL for that would be my F comm slash shopping so this way you can do forwarding with one ingress of the same host to multiple applications using multiple paths another use case is when instead of using URLs to make different applications accessible some companies use subdomains so instead of having my app comm slash analytics they create a subdomain analytics dot my app comm so if you have your application configured that way your configuration will look like this so instead of having one host like in the previous example and multiple paths here inside now you have multiple hosts where each host represents a subdomain and inside you just have one path that again redirects the request to analytic service pretty straightforward so now in the same request setting you have analytic service and a part behind it another request will look like this using a subdomain instead of path and one final topic that I mentioned that we'll cover here is configuring TLS certificate till now we've only seen ingress configuration for HTTP requests but it's super easy to configure HTTP forwarding in ingress so the only thing that you need to do is define attribute called TLS above the rules section with host which is the same host as right here and the secret name which is a reference of a secret that you have to create in a cluster that holds that TLS certificate so the secret configuration would look like this so the name is the reference right here and the data or the actual contents contain TLS certificate and TLS key if you've seen my other videos where I create different components like secret you probably notice the type additional type attribute here in kubernetes there is a specific type of a secret called TLS so I'll have to use that type when you create a TLS secret and there are three notes to me to be made here one is that the keys of this data have to be named exactly like that the values are the actual file contents of the certificate or key contents and not the file path or location so you have to put the whole content here basics before encode it and the third one is that you have to create the secret in the same namespace as the ingress component for it to be able to use that otherwise you can't reference a secret from another namespace and these four lines is all you need to configure mapping of an HTTP request to that host to internal service thanks for watching the video I hope it was helpful and if it was don't forget to like it if you want to be notified whenever a new video comes out then
