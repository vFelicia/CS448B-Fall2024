With timestamps:

00:00 - many of you may be wondering if devops
00:02 - carrier is for you if you have been
00:05 - following and watching my videos you
00:07 - probably already know that I love devops
00:09 - and have a lot of passion for it but is
00:12 - devops for everyone and what are some of
00:15 - the reasons why I personally like devops
00:18 - and chose it as a career and what are
00:20 - some of the advantages that speaks for
00:24 - choosing devops as a career in general I
00:26 - want to start with my own background and
00:29 - story of how I ended up in devops I
00:32 - started off as a software developer and
00:35 - in one of my software development
00:37 - projects I started taking over tasks of
00:39 - configuring servers configuring builds
00:42 - in Jenkins configuring application
00:44 - packaging Etc
00:46 - or configuring things around Docker and
00:48 - running containers making the builds
00:51 - faster making tests faster and so on and
00:54 - I noticed that tasks that were related
00:56 - to configuring stuff and optimizing
00:59 - processes were more enjoyable for me
01:01 - than programming now these are just a
01:04 - subset of tasks in devops I was
01:06 - basically doing some tasks around CI CD
01:08 - configuration but devops is much more
01:11 - than that it spends the whole software
01:13 - development life cycle essentially
01:15 - optimizing and configuring things for
01:18 - different parts of that software
01:20 - development life cycle now if you don't
01:23 - know exactly what devops involves and
01:25 - what that software development lifecycle
01:27 - includes I have a dedicated video on
01:29 - that that you can watch so basically
01:32 - when you're doing software development
01:34 - you are zoomed in into one specific part
01:37 - of that software development life cycle
01:40 - when you're doing it operations again
01:42 - you are focused on a specific area of
01:45 - that life cycle
01:46 - with the devops however you zoom out
01:49 - from those specific areas and parts and
01:52 - start seeing the big picture or a bird's
01:55 - eye view of the whole software
01:57 - development workflow and you start
02:00 - analyzing how each of those areas are
02:03 - connected like software development
02:04 - processes with Git workflows connect to
02:08 - cicd pipeline or CSD pipeline connected
02:11 - to infrastructure Etc and you start
02:14 - analyzing which areas need improvements
02:16 - which ones have bottlenecks like
02:18 - development workflow is super optimized
02:21 - so your team's generating new features
02:23 - fast but the pipeline is slow and
02:26 - blocking the release of those features
02:28 - to production now what I also observed
02:31 - is that a different type of thinking is
02:34 - required for devops you need high level
02:37 - thinking connecting dots on a high level
02:40 - width instead of depth like an architect
02:43 - making the plan of the whole building
02:45 - and planning how different parts are
02:48 - connected and implemented and then you
02:50 - have different specializations who
02:52 - actually carry out that plan so I
02:55 - personally like that role a lot
03:00 - and because devops covers the whole
03:03 - software development life cycle the set
03:05 - of tasks or the range of tasks is much
03:08 - more diverse and rich in variety like
03:12 - you could be looking at front-end code
03:13 - and optimizing application packaging
03:16 - process the next thing could be
03:18 - configuring deployment servers on cloud
03:20 - then scripting a program to automate
03:23 - some infrastructure configuration tasks
03:25 - and if you're like me this may be much
03:27 - more interesting and exciting for many
03:30 - people and again this is probably a
03:32 - personal preference some people love
03:34 - focusing on their area of expertise
03:37 - deepening their knowledge in it like I
03:40 - learned JavaScript and then I just
03:42 - learned JavaScript to the most advanced
03:44 - level different Frameworks different
03:46 - features Etc and there is enough to
03:49 - learn for ears in each language and
03:51 - Technology but for many this can be
03:53 - boring if you're like me you want to
03:56 - have more diverse set of tasks you want
03:59 - to go broader I like like architecting
04:01 - processes instead instead of
04:03 - specializing in just one tool or
04:05 - technology I like to understand whole
04:08 - software development life cycle process
04:10 - and how it all works and more
04:13 - importantly how I can optimize different
04:15 - parts of that life cycle identifying
04:18 - opportunities for improvements and
04:20 - optimizations like packaging the
04:22 - application takes too long setting up
04:24 - environment for tests is too slow
04:26 - security of the build image is not
04:29 - properly checked or maybe not enough
04:31 - bugs get discovered before deploying to
04:34 - the end environment or the build process
04:36 - is taking too long or we find out about
04:38 - issues in production too late maybe
04:41 - operation team has a lot of effort and
04:43 - needs long time to update and maintain
04:46 - kubernetes cluster it takes too long to
04:48 - approve and be confident about deploying
04:51 - new features into production as a devops
04:54 - engineer you can solve all these
04:56 - challenges and that in itself for me is
04:59 - a very fulfilling work improving things
05:02 - optimizing making things faster
05:04 - automating Etc and this leads to the
05:07 - next reason which is the impact as a
05:10 - devops engineer you can have a huge
05:13 - business impact in your company by
05:15 - having a good understanding of the whole
05:18 - software development life cycle and
05:20 - improving and optimizing it and this
05:23 - again can be super fulfilling to know
05:26 - that your work has such an impact and
05:28 - affects many people eventually you can
05:31 - build processes through automation that
05:33 - make the work of your fellow team
05:35 - members in the organization much easier
05:38 - smooth well architected processes means
05:41 - that Engineers can focus on their areas
05:44 - of expertise and generally enjoy their
05:46 - work much more instead of doing some
05:48 - boring manual things instead so you can
05:51 - make lives of developers operations
05:54 - testers project managers and so on
05:57 - easier but you also bring huge business
06:00 - value well implemented devops processes
06:03 - will lead to faster time to Market and
06:06 - constant Improvement of business quality
06:08 - Etc which means end users are happier
06:11 - and Company can innovate and deliver
06:13 - much better so you have an impact on the
06:16 - whole business and this brings me to the
06:19 - next point which is demand for devops
06:22 - and salary
06:24 - since this is a position that has such a
06:26 - huge impact it automatically means that
06:29 - you are super valuable for your team and
06:31 - your company because you literally have
06:34 - direct impact on time to Market how
06:37 - satisfied the engineers are with work
06:39 - etc and companies see that value that's
06:42 - why the demand for devops engineers has
06:44 - increased so dramatically over the past
06:46 - few years organizations that have
06:49 - implemented devops practices are in fact
06:51 - seeing the benefits of high performance
06:53 - much faster deployments compared to
06:56 - competitors and logically are willing to
06:58 - pay high salaries to find devops experts
07:00 - the demand is very clearly visible on
07:03 - job platforms as well indeed.com a major
07:07 - job platform for example had a 75
07:09 - increase in devops job listings and on
07:13 - LinkedIn there was a 50 increase in
07:16 - mentioning devops as a skill and combine
07:19 - these huge value you are bringing to the
07:22 - company and the high demand for devops
07:24 - skills with the fact that there are very
07:27 - few Engineers who actually have those
07:29 - skills and can fill the role this means
07:32 - if you are a devops engineer you are
07:34 - highly demanded and companies will pay
07:36 - premium for having you this means
07:39 - flexibility lots of options High salary
07:41 - with lots of added benefits so you have
07:44 - a super high leverage this means if you
07:47 - actually learn devops you will
07:49 - drastically increase your value on the
07:51 - global Marketplace and get a whole new
07:54 - set of opportunities out there and I
07:56 - think people should definitely take
07:58 - advantage of this opportunity but I also
08:01 - know learning devops can be daunting and
08:03 - difficult and that's exactly why last
08:06 - year we created this full educational
08:08 - program to give people the opportunity
08:10 - to learn all necessary skills to become
08:13 - a devops engineer to actually be able to
08:16 - get a job and then start working as a
08:18 - devops engineer and do all these cool
08:21 - stuff that I mentioned but again not
08:23 - just learn some base 6 and then get a
08:25 - job and be stressed there because you
08:27 - can't actually do the real devops tasks
08:29 - they ask you to do but really prepare
08:32 - you to go out there and build those
08:35 - devops processes and do the actual real
08:38 - life devops tasks
08:40 - because often companies would hire you
08:42 - in devops if you have a software
08:44 - development or operations background and
08:46 - then let you transition to devops slowly
08:50 - by giving you various devops tasks but
08:52 - this is a slow and painful and not very
08:54 - efficient way to get into devops plus
08:57 - you don't get hired as a devops engineer
08:59 - right away so you don't really get those
09:01 - benefits that I mentioned and we created
09:04 - our program to give you exactly these
09:07 - skills and knowledge to confidently go
09:09 - out there apply for a job as a devops
09:11 - engineer who can help the company
09:13 - implement the devops processes from day
09:15 - one and that's what extremely valuable
09:18 - for the employers
09:20 - we have already educated thousands of
09:22 - people throughout bootcamp and from the
09:24 - feedbacks we know the amazing impact we
09:27 - are making by educating people in this
09:29 - highly demanded field so this is
09:32 - definitely going to be an investment in
09:34 - your education that will help you get to
09:36 - the next level in the it Market all the
09:39 - information about the boot camp is in
09:41 - the video description if you're
09:42 - interested but now let's talk about the
09:45 - company perspective from the company's
09:47 - perspective when they are looking for a
09:49 - devops engineer they usually write a job
09:52 - opening and either they cannot find any
09:55 - devops engineer or get candidates that
09:58 - want to be devops Engineers but don't
10:00 - really have enough knowledge yet like
10:03 - they have been developers or can
10:05 - configure servers but they don't really
10:06 - have any devops or core devops skills so
10:10 - usually what companies do instead is
10:12 - they upskill their existing employees or
10:16 - hire young engineers and train them
10:18 - specifically in devops because if they
10:21 - can't find them they should train them
10:23 - but again to train people to become
10:25 - devops engineers you need a devops
10:27 - engineer to actually train them so we
10:29 - have a lot of companies who upskill
10:31 - their engineers in devops using our
10:34 - bootcamp which is another proof that
10:36 - companies are willing to invest in
10:39 - building devops know how internally to
10:41 - implement devops throughout the
10:43 - organization
10:45 - now I know that there is some
10:47 - controversy around devops as a role that
10:51 - it was meant as a set of Concepts and
10:53 - principles and not as an engineering
10:56 - role but the reality is that there are
10:58 - real devops engineering job positions
11:00 - and people who actually work as devops
11:03 - engineers and I actually made a
11:05 - dedicated video on that as well
11:07 - explaining the topic and how it all
11:09 - evolved so if you're interested you can
11:12 - go check it out
11:13 - finally since in devops you are covering
11:16 - the whole software development lifecycle
11:19 - it means you work with lots of tools so
11:22 - you need to be constantly learning and
11:25 - expanding your knowledge now this might
11:27 - be an advantage if you're like me and
11:30 - really enjoy learning new stuff all the
11:32 - time or it could be a disadvantage if
11:35 - you want to focus and solidify knowledge
11:38 - in a few Technologies this is actually a
11:42 - necessary thing since devops is still
11:44 - evolving and there is a lot of Dynamics
11:47 - and changes in devops area so you have
11:49 - new tools New Concepts and solutions
11:51 - that people come up with all the time
11:54 - and as a devops engineer you need to
11:56 - actually stay up to date and see what
11:58 - new Solutions are available to make the
12:01 - processes even better one of these tools
12:04 - you might want to check out is actually
12:05 - polomi who is the sponsor of this video
12:08 - polome is a modern Universal
12:11 - infrastructure as code tool which is
12:13 - gaining popularity with polony you don't
12:16 - need to learn a new domain specific
12:18 - language but you can use your already
12:21 - familiar programming language tools and
12:23 - software engineering practices to deploy
12:26 - and manage your Cloud infrastructure on
12:29 - any Cloud platform this unites
12:31 - developers infrastructure teams and
12:33 - security Engineers around a common
12:36 - platform so that everyone can speak the
12:38 - same language and ship modern Cloud
12:40 - applications quickly and reliably if you
12:43 - want to learn more about palomi I
12:44 - actually have a separate video on it
12:46 - where you can see how it works in
12:48 - practice and with that let's move on
12:50 - DeVos processes are never completed you
12:53 - don't just build stuff and complete your
12:55 - work once it's a constant ongoing
12:58 - process just like developing an
12:59 - application you don't just create an
13:01 - application once and you're done you
13:03 - make improvements and continue making
13:05 - the application better and better adding
13:07 - new features fixing the bugs and issues
13:11 - ETC it's the same thing with devops
13:13 - processes so lots of new things to learn
13:16 - all the time as I said this could also
13:18 - be a disadvantage and of course like
13:20 - with everything there are pros and cons
13:23 - here as well devops does come with some
13:26 - challenges as well like too much to
13:28 - learn and too broad of a responsibility
13:30 - can be overwhelming for some people also
13:33 - often there are unclear requirements
13:36 - because companies themselves don't know
13:38 - what devops is exactly so you may get
13:41 - pushed into some role or in doing tasks
13:44 - which are not really in the devops area
13:46 - another big challenge is communication
13:49 - with various teams in the organization
13:51 - and it can be frustrating if they don't
13:54 - cooperate but I plan to make a separate
13:57 - video where I talk about advantages and
13:59 - challenges of devops as a career in
14:02 - general so that you can decide whether a
14:04 - career in devops is right for you so be
14:07 - sure to subscribe and activate the
14:10 - notification Bell to not miss that video
14:13 - now finally I want to mention that
14:15 - choosing a career path is extremely
14:17 - personal and depends on many personal
14:20 - circumstances for me being a devops
14:23 - engineer is working on a wide variety of
14:26 - tasks with a wide variety of
14:28 - Technologies and tools it's
14:30 - understanding the bigger picture and
14:32 - being able to investigate issues
14:34 - efficiently and for me the impact and
14:37 - fulfillment from the work definitely
14:39 - outweighs the challenges now I hope this
14:42 - video gave you good insights into devops
14:45 - and that I could provide some valuable
14:47 - information around it it would be really
14:50 - interesting to know what are your
14:52 - experiences in devops and your personal
14:54 - preferences so share them in the
14:56 - comments for me and for others who are
14:58 - watching the video with that thank you
15:00 - for watching and see you in the next
15:03 - video

Cleaned transcript:

many of you may be wondering if devops carrier is for you if you have been following and watching my videos you probably already know that I love devops and have a lot of passion for it but is devops for everyone and what are some of the reasons why I personally like devops and chose it as a career and what are some of the advantages that speaks for choosing devops as a career in general I want to start with my own background and story of how I ended up in devops I started off as a software developer and in one of my software development projects I started taking over tasks of configuring servers configuring builds in Jenkins configuring application packaging Etc or configuring things around Docker and running containers making the builds faster making tests faster and so on and I noticed that tasks that were related to configuring stuff and optimizing processes were more enjoyable for me than programming now these are just a subset of tasks in devops I was basically doing some tasks around CI CD configuration but devops is much more than that it spends the whole software development life cycle essentially optimizing and configuring things for different parts of that software development life cycle now if you don't know exactly what devops involves and what that software development lifecycle includes I have a dedicated video on that that you can watch so basically when you're doing software development you are zoomed in into one specific part of that software development life cycle when you're doing it operations again you are focused on a specific area of that life cycle with the devops however you zoom out from those specific areas and parts and start seeing the big picture or a bird's eye view of the whole software development workflow and you start analyzing how each of those areas are connected like software development processes with Git workflows connect to cicd pipeline or CSD pipeline connected to infrastructure Etc and you start analyzing which areas need improvements which ones have bottlenecks like development workflow is super optimized so your team's generating new features fast but the pipeline is slow and blocking the release of those features to production now what I also observed is that a different type of thinking is required for devops you need high level thinking connecting dots on a high level width instead of depth like an architect making the plan of the whole building and planning how different parts are connected and implemented and then you have different specializations who actually carry out that plan so I personally like that role a lot and because devops covers the whole software development life cycle the set of tasks or the range of tasks is much more diverse and rich in variety like you could be looking at frontend code and optimizing application packaging process the next thing could be configuring deployment servers on cloud then scripting a program to automate some infrastructure configuration tasks and if you're like me this may be much more interesting and exciting for many people and again this is probably a personal preference some people love focusing on their area of expertise deepening their knowledge in it like I learned JavaScript and then I just learned JavaScript to the most advanced level different Frameworks different features Etc and there is enough to learn for ears in each language and Technology but for many this can be boring if you're like me you want to have more diverse set of tasks you want to go broader I like like architecting processes instead instead of specializing in just one tool or technology I like to understand whole software development life cycle process and how it all works and more importantly how I can optimize different parts of that life cycle identifying opportunities for improvements and optimizations like packaging the application takes too long setting up environment for tests is too slow security of the build image is not properly checked or maybe not enough bugs get discovered before deploying to the end environment or the build process is taking too long or we find out about issues in production too late maybe operation team has a lot of effort and needs long time to update and maintain kubernetes cluster it takes too long to approve and be confident about deploying new features into production as a devops engineer you can solve all these challenges and that in itself for me is a very fulfilling work improving things optimizing making things faster automating Etc and this leads to the next reason which is the impact as a devops engineer you can have a huge business impact in your company by having a good understanding of the whole software development life cycle and improving and optimizing it and this again can be super fulfilling to know that your work has such an impact and affects many people eventually you can build processes through automation that make the work of your fellow team members in the organization much easier smooth well architected processes means that Engineers can focus on their areas of expertise and generally enjoy their work much more instead of doing some boring manual things instead so you can make lives of developers operations testers project managers and so on easier but you also bring huge business value well implemented devops processes will lead to faster time to Market and constant Improvement of business quality Etc which means end users are happier and Company can innovate and deliver much better so you have an impact on the whole business and this brings me to the next point which is demand for devops and salary since this is a position that has such a huge impact it automatically means that you are super valuable for your team and your company because you literally have direct impact on time to Market how satisfied the engineers are with work etc and companies see that value that's why the demand for devops engineers has increased so dramatically over the past few years organizations that have implemented devops practices are in fact seeing the benefits of high performance much faster deployments compared to competitors and logically are willing to pay high salaries to find devops experts the demand is very clearly visible on job platforms as well indeed.com a major job platform for example had a 75

premium for having you this means flexibility lots of options High salary with lots of added benefits so you have a super high leverage this means if you actually learn devops you will drastically increase your value on the global Marketplace and get a whole new set of opportunities out there and I think people should definitely take advantage of this opportunity but I also know learning devops

people also often there are unclear requirements because companies themselves don't know what devops is exactly so you may get pushed into some role or in doing tasks which are not really in the devops area another big challenge is communication with various teams in the organization and it can be frustrating if they don't cooperate but I plan to make a separate video where I talk about advantages and challenges of devops as a career in general so that you can decide whether a career in devops is right for you so be sure to subscribe and activate the notification Bell to not miss that video now finally I want to mention that choosing a career path is extremely personal and depends on many personal circumstances for me being a devops engineer is working on a wide variety of tasks with a wide variety of Technologies and tools it's understanding the bigger picture and being able to investigate issues efficiently and for me the impact and fulfillment from the work definitely outweighs the challenges now I hope this video gave you good insights into devops and that I could provide some valuable information around it it would be really interesting to know what are your experiences in devops and your personal preferences so share them in the comments for me and for others who are watching the video with that thank you for watching and see you in the next video
