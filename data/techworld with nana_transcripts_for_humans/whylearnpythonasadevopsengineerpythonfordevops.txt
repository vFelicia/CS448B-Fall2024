00:00 - i saw a lot of messages and questions
00:02 - from you guys
00:03 - about why a devops engineer needs to
00:06 - know
00:06 - python it seems like there are only
00:09 - vague answers to that on the internet so
00:12 - with this video i want to give you
00:14 - clear answers to the following questions
00:17 - why is python so popular in general
00:20 - why is python demanded in devops
00:23 - specifically
00:24 - what is python used for in devops giving
00:27 - you specific
00:28 - examples how much python knowledge
00:32 - you need to have as a devops engineer
00:34 - and finally
00:36 - how to get started with python what is
00:38 - python and why
00:40 - is it so popular first of all python
00:43 - is a programming language just like java
00:45 - or javascript
00:47 - python compared to other languages has
00:50 - two
00:50 - very big advantages first of all it's
00:53 - easy to learn it has a simple syntax and
00:56 - it's very easy to set up and get started
00:58 - with
00:59 - for example compared to java where you
01:01 - need
01:02 - some initial configuration before you
01:04 - can even start your application
01:06 - but it's equally or even more powerful
01:09 - than java
01:10 - now what makes a language powerful or
01:13 - how can i say that python is more
01:15 - powerful
01:16 - well that comes from the ecosystem which
01:19 - means
01:20 - libraries and modules that python
01:22 - developers themselves develop
01:24 - but also external developers create and
01:27 - maintain
01:28 - so the more people adopt the language
01:30 - the more powerful it gets
01:32 - because new libraries and so new
01:34 - functionalities get added to it
01:37 - and the second advantage is that it's
01:39 - flexible now what does a
01:41 - flexible mean in this case what makes a
01:43 - language flexible
01:45 - it is easy to mold to your wishes
01:48 - so you are not limited or restricted by
01:51 - the language specifics like
01:52 - syntax or data types or some other
01:55 - constraints
01:56 - you can extend python widely
02:00 - and as one of the results of this
02:02 - flexibility
02:03 - python also became a multi-purpose
02:06 - language
02:07 - meaning it is used for many different
02:09 - categories
02:10 - like data science web development
02:12 - machine learning and for devops to write
02:15 - automation scripts
02:19 - now if you check the devops engineer job
02:22 - descriptions
02:23 - you will see that more than 90 of them
02:26 - include
02:26 - python as a requirement so
02:30 - why is python so popular and demanded
02:33 - for devops jobs
02:34 - why not a different programming or
02:36 - scripting language for example
02:38 - actually it's because of the
02:39 - characteristics i mentioned before
02:41 - that it's flexible simple and easy to
02:44 - read
02:45 - yet very powerful now let's get more
02:48 - specific
02:49 - first of all python does not need to be
02:51 - compiled
02:52 - and built like java for example which
02:55 - makes developing in python
02:57 - fast and painless so it's perfectly
02:59 - suited for
03:00 - simple scripts to execute simple tasks
03:04 - second python is very lightweight it
03:06 - does not require
03:08 - a huge run time like java does so it's
03:11 - super easy to install
03:12 - and run the third reason is that python
03:16 - syntax is
03:16 - very simple it almost reads like
03:20 - pseudocode now why is that important
03:23 - because it makes it easy for people who
03:25 - didn't write the script themselves
03:28 - to read and understand the code so they
03:31 - can also work on it and this makes
03:33 - python scripts
03:34 - much more maintainable compared to best
03:36 - scripts for example
03:37 - and compared to bash scripts or
03:39 - powershell scripts
03:41 - python is platform independent meaning
03:44 - it can run the same
03:45 - on linux windows or mac os
03:48 - and finally another reason is that
03:50 - python has
03:51 - many great libraries to automate devops
03:54 - tasks
03:55 - and again it's because of its large
03:58 - community
03:59 - libraries are great because it means
04:01 - that instead of
04:02 - writing everything from scratch you can
04:04 - make use of
04:05 - other people's code and build on that so
04:08 - these are basically all the reasons why
04:10 - python is one of the primary
04:12 - technologies used for devops tasks
04:15 - now let's see specific examples of what
04:18 - python is used for in devops
04:21 - you as a devops engineer will be working
04:24 - with many different tools
04:25 - and trying to combine them that's really
04:27 - the specifics of a devops job
04:29 - compared to others you need to know a
04:31 - lot of tools to build devops processes
04:34 - like
04:34 - ci cd infrastructure preparation and
04:37 - management
04:38 - monitoring and so on to give you some
04:40 - specific examples
04:42 - automatically update jira ticket
04:44 - information
04:45 - after jenkins build has run successfully
04:48 - or automatically trigger jenkins jobs on
04:51 - some
04:52 - events that happen during software
04:54 - development process
04:56 - sending notifications to right team
04:58 - members on specific events
05:00 - when something happens in the system in
05:02 - the deployment environment or even
05:04 - cicd pipeline like build failures
05:08 - or application errors etc maybe doing
05:11 - regular backups of your nexus or jenkins
05:14 - servers
05:14 - or your application databases cleaning
05:17 - up
05:18 - old docker images from the servers to
05:20 - free up
05:21 - server space etc so these are examples
05:25 - of tasks that devops engineer may need
05:28 - to do
05:29 - at work and these things are complex
05:32 - with lots of small details and lots of
05:34 - repetitive tasks
05:36 - so you at some point would want to make
05:38 - your own life
05:39 - easier and to make these processes more
05:42 - efficient
05:42 - and make less mistakes so you would want
05:46 - to automate these tasks
05:47 - so more automation and less manual work
05:50 - for you
05:51 - in addition to that you may need or want
05:54 - to create
05:54 - automation scripts or small programs for
05:57 - your team
05:58 - for developers and testers and
06:01 - operations etc
06:02 - to solve some of their problems and this
06:05 - could be a really cool part of your job
06:07 - actually
06:08 - i know i am excited when i can create
06:10 - programs that automate stuff
06:12 - that developers or testers or even it
06:15 - project managers
06:17 - have been doing manually in the company
06:19 - the whole time
06:20 - and now you come to the rescue and make
06:22 - their lives easier too
06:24 - so now you see how useful python
06:26 - knowledge could be for a devops engineer
06:28 - and how it can help you in your devops
06:31 - job
06:32 - but also make you more valuable at your
06:35 - work
06:36 - and for your entire team now let's look
06:38 - at the question
06:39 - how much programming and python
06:41 - knowledge you need to have
06:42 - as a devops engineer you do not have to
06:45 - know all the details
06:46 - of the language and you do not need to
06:49 - be able to design
06:50 - or implement huge and complex software
06:53 - applications
06:54 - or create some fancy websites with it
06:56 - what you need is to be able to
06:58 - automate tasks that you or your team
07:01 - members would otherwise do
07:03 - manually like monitoring doing backups
07:06 - and cleanups
07:06 - etc to be able to do that you'll need to
07:10 - be familiar with the basics of python
07:13 - things like the basic syntax the data
07:15 - types
07:16 - being able to write simple logic knowing
07:19 - how to use modules
07:20 - and libraries etc there are a lot of
07:23 - advanced
07:24 - programming concepts like object
07:26 - oriented programming
07:27 - inheritance or parallel programming as
07:30 - well as
07:31 - python web frameworks and these are nice
07:34 - to know
07:34 - things but they're not essential to your
07:37 - job
07:37 - what's more important is that you should
07:39 - be comfortable with
07:41 - package management and integrating
07:43 - third-party libraries
07:45 - or working with apis for external
07:47 - applications like cloud providers
07:50 - and so on so now you might be asking
07:52 - yourself
07:53 - how you can get started with learning
07:55 - python
07:56 - well i actually have a free complete
07:58 - python course on my channel
08:00 - in which you can learn the basics of
08:03 - programming
08:04 - in python like syntax and data types
08:07 - using modules and packages etc
08:10 - but after you've learned the basics of
08:12 - programming in python
08:13 - it's important to apply this knowledge
08:15 - and work on
08:16 - real devops tasks so you can research
08:20 - some examples online yourself and try to
08:22 - automate stuff
08:24 - with python to get some first hands-on
08:27 - experience in that
08:28 - or i also have a complete devops
08:31 - bootcamp
08:32 - an educational program in which you
08:34 - learn all the technologies you need to
08:36 - know as a devops engineer
08:38 - which also includes a module for
08:41 - automation with python
08:43 - with several cool real-life demo
08:46 - projects to automate some of the most
08:48 - common
08:49 - devops tasks like application and server
08:52 - monitoring
08:53 - data backups cloud automation tasks with
08:56 - aws
08:57 - and so on so if you're interested you
08:59 - can check that out as well
09:00 - so i hope this video has helped you to
09:02 - get a clear understanding of
09:04 - why you need python as a devops engineer
09:07 - and i hope
09:08 - i clarified some of your questions with
09:10 - that
09:11 - thank you for watching and see you in
09:13 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

i saw a lot of messages and questions from you guys about why a devops engineer needs to know python it seems like there are only vague answers to that on the internet so with this video i want to give you clear answers to the following questions why is python so popular in general why is python demanded in devops specifically what is python used for in devops giving you specific examples how
