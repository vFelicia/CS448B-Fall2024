00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - so in this video I will show you how to
00:08 - install darker on different operating
00:10 - systems the installation will differ not
00:13 - only based on the operating system but
00:15 - also the version of the operating system
00:17 - so you can actually watch this video
00:19 - selectively depending on which OS and
00:22 - the version of that OS you have I will
00:24 - show you how to find out which
00:26 - installation step applies to you in the
00:28 - before installing section which is the
00:30 - first one so once you find that out you
00:33 - can actually directly skip to that part
00:34 - of the video where I explain that into
00:37 - details I will put the mini locations of
00:39 - each part in the description part of the
00:42 - video and also I will put all the links
00:44 - that I use in the video in the
00:46 - description so that you can easily
00:49 - access them also if you have any
00:51 - questions during the video or if you get
00:54 - stuck installing the docker on your
00:55 - system please post your question or
00:58 - problem in the comment section so that I
01:00 - can get back to you and help you proceed
01:03 - or maybe someone from the community will
01:05 - so with that said let's dive right into
01:08 - it so if you want to install docker you
01:12 - can actually google it and you get an
01:15 - official documentation of docker
01:17 - it's important to note there are two
01:20 - editions of docker there is a community
01:22 - and Enterprise editions for us to begin
01:25 - with Community Edition will be just fine
01:28 - in the docker Community Edition tab
01:32 - there there is a list of operating
01:34 - systems and distributions in order to
01:37 - install docker so for example if we
01:40 - start with Mac we can click in here and
01:43 - we see the documentation of how to
01:46 - install it on Mac which is actually one
01:48 - of the easiest but we'll see some some
01:51 - other ones as well so before you install
01:56 - darker on your Mac or Windows computer
01:59 - there are prerequisites to be considered
02:01 - so for Mac and Windows
02:04 - there has to be some criteria of the
02:08 - operating system and the hardware met in
02:11 - order to support running
02:13 - if you have make go through the system
02:17 - requirements to see if your make version
02:20 - is actually supporting docker if you
02:23 - have windows then you can go to the
02:25 - Windows tab and look at the system
02:28 - requirements there or what to know
02:31 - before you install for example one thing
02:35 - to note is that docker natively runs
02:38 - only on Windows 10 so if you have a
02:41 - Windows version which is less than 10
02:43 - then we docker cannot run natively on
02:47 - your computer so if your computer
02:52 - doesn't meet the requirements to run
02:53 - docker there is a workaround for that
02:56 - which is called docker toolbox that of
02:59 - docker you basically just have to
03:00 - install a docker toolbox that will
03:03 - become a sort of a bridge between your
03:05 - operating system and the docker and that
03:08 - will enable you to run docker on your
03:10 - legacy computer so if that applies to
03:14 - you then skip ahead in this video to the
03:17 - part where I explain how to install
03:19 - docker toolbox on Mac and on windows
03:25 - so let's install docker for Mac as we
03:29 - see here there are two channels that you
03:32 - can download the binaries from or the
03:35 - application from will go with a stable
03:37 - channel and other things you consider if
03:39 - you have an older version of Mac the
03:42 - software or the hardware please go
03:44 - through the system requirements to see
03:46 - if you can actually install docker so
03:49 - here there is a detailed description of
03:52 - what make version you need to be able to
03:56 - run docker and also you need at least 4
03:58 - gigabytes of RAM and by installing
04:03 - darker you will actually have the whole
04:05 - package of it which is a darker engine
04:07 - which is important or which is necessary
04:12 - to run the docker containers on your
04:14 - laptop the docker command-line client
04:16 - which will enable you to execute some
04:20 - token commands docker compose if you
04:22 - don't know it yet don't worry about it
04:25 - but it's just technology to orchestrate
04:28 - if you have multiple containers and some
04:32 - other stuff that we're not gonna need in
04:34 - this tutorial but you will have
04:36 - everything in a package installed so go
04:39 - ahead and download the stable version
04:43 - well I already have darker installed
04:46 - from the edge channel so I won't be
04:50 - stalling it again but it shouldn't
04:53 - matter because the steps of installation
04:54 - are the same for both
04:57 - so once the docker dmg file is
05:01 - downloaded you just double click on it
05:03 - and it will pop up this window just drag
05:09 - the docker well up into the applications
05:13 - and will be installed on your Mac as the
05:18 - next step you will see docker
05:20 - installed in your applications so you
05:24 - can just go ahead and start it
05:33 - so as you see the docker sign or icon is
05:38 - starting here if you click on it you see
05:41 - the status that docker is running and
05:45 - you can configure some preferences and
05:49 - check the docker version and so on and
05:53 - if you want to stop talker or quited on
05:56 - your Mac you can just do it from here
06:00 - and importance may be interesting note
06:03 - here is that if let's say you download
06:08 - or install docker and if you have more
06:12 - than one accounts on your laptop you
06:16 - will actually get some errors or
06:18 - conflicts if you run docker at the same
06:20 - time or multiple accounts so what I do
06:25 - for example is that if I switch to
06:26 - another account where I'm also gonna
06:29 - need docker I quit it from here and then
06:32 - I started from from the other account so
06:35 - that I don't get any errors so that
06:39 - might be something you need to consider
06:41 - if you use multiple accounts so let's
06:46 - see how to install Tucker for Windows
06:48 - the first step as I mentioned before is
06:50 - to go to the before you install section
06:53 - and to see that your operating system
06:57 - and your computer meets all the criteria
06:58 - to run docker natively so if you are
07:03 - installing dog for the first time don't
07:05 - worry about most of these parts like
07:07 - doctor toolbox and doctor machine there
07:09 - are two things that are important one is
07:13 - to double check that your Windows
07:15 - version is compatible for docker and the
07:18 - second one is to have virtualization
07:20 - enabled virtualization is by default
07:23 - always enabled other than you manually
07:26 - disabled it so if you're unsure then you
07:29 - can check it by going to the task
07:32 - manager performance CPU tab and here you
07:36 - can see the status of the virtualization
07:39 - so once you have checked that and made
07:42 - sure this that these two prerequisites
07:46 - are met
07:47 - then actually you can scroll up and
07:49 - download the windows installer for from
07:53 - the stable channel once the Installer is
07:56 - downloaded you can just click on it and
07:58 - follow the installation wizard to
08:01 - install docker for Windows once the
08:05 - installation is completed you have to
08:07 - explicitly start docker because it's not
08:10 - going to start automatically so for that
08:12 - you can just go and search for the
08:15 - docker for Windows app on your Windows
08:17 - and just click on it and you will see
08:21 - the darker whale icon starting and if
08:25 - you click on that icon you can actually
08:27 - see the status that says Stoker is now
08:30 - up and running so this is basically it
08:33 - for the installation
08:38 - now let's see how to install Tucker on
08:41 - different Linux distributions and this
08:44 - is where things get a little bit more
08:46 - complicated so first of all you see that
08:49 - in this menu on the on the left you see
08:53 - that for four different Linux
08:56 - distributions the installation steps
08:58 - will differ but also for example if we
09:01 - just click on one two for the guide you
09:05 - can see that in the prerequisites
09:07 - section there is also differentiation
09:11 - between the versions of the same Linux
09:13 - distribution and there may be some even
09:17 - more complicated scenarios where the
09:18 - combination of the version of the
09:20 - distribution and the architecture it's
09:23 - running in also makes some difference in
09:26 - to how to setup docker on that specific
09:29 - environment because of that I can't go
09:34 - through a docker installation process of
09:36 - every Linux environment because they're
09:39 - just too many combinations so instead
09:42 - what we'll do is just go through a
09:44 - general overview of the steps and
09:46 - configuration process to get darker
09:49 - running on your Linux environment and
09:52 - you can just adjust it then for your
09:54 - specific setup so these are some general
09:57 - steps to follow in order to install
09:58 - docker on your Linux Linux environment
10:01 - first of all you have to go through the
10:04 - operating system requirements part on
10:07 - your on the relevant Linux distribution
10:11 - that applies for you a second step in
10:15 - the documentation to is to any sell old
10:17 - versions however if it's the first time
10:19 - you installing darker then you know I
10:22 - have to worry about that you also don't
10:24 - have to worry about the support its
10:25 - storage drivers and you can skip ahead
10:28 - to the part of installing darker
10:31 - Community Edition so for any Linux
10:36 - distribution here the steps will be or
10:39 - the options for installing docker will
10:41 - be the same so first option is basically
10:45 - to set up a repository and download the
10:48 - docker from install it from the dock
10:51 - repository the second option is to
10:55 - install the packages manually however I
10:58 - wouldn't recommend it and I think the
11:00 - documentation doesn't recommend it
11:02 - either because then you will have to do
11:04 - a lot of steps of the installation in
11:07 - the maintenance of the versions manually
11:10 - so I wouldn't do that the third one is
11:13 - just with the testing purposes it may be
11:15 - enough for the development purposes as
11:17 - well but I would still not do it which
11:19 - is basically just download downloading
11:23 - some automated scripts that will install
11:27 - and setup docker on your Linux
11:30 - environment however again I wouldn't go
11:33 - with it
11:34 - I would actually just do the first
11:37 - option which is just downloading the
11:40 - darker from the repository so in order
11:44 - to install darker using the first option
11:47 - which is downloading it from the Dockers
11:50 - repositories you have two main steps so
11:53 - the first one is to set up the
11:56 - repository which differs a little bit
12:00 - depending on which distribution you have
12:02 - and then install the docker seee from
12:05 - the repository so from Ubuntu and Debian
12:09 - the steps for setting up the repository
12:12 - are generally just updating your package
12:16 - and then setting up an HTTP connection
12:20 - with the repository and adding the
12:23 - Dockers official jpg key which only
12:26 - Ubuntu and Debian need you don't have to
12:30 - do this steps for CentOS and fedora
12:33 - there just have to install the required
12:38 - packages in the last step for setting up
12:45 - the repository is basically setting up
12:49 - the stable repository of docker which we
12:52 - saw previously on the overview that
12:55 - there are two channels which is a stable
12:56 - and edge here you always have to set up
13:00 - the stable repository optionally you can
13:02 - also
13:04 - set up the edge repository but I'll just
13:06 - do stable this time and here also
13:11 - something to notice depending on
13:13 - architecture you have to actually set it
13:17 - or you have to set that as a parameter
13:19 - when you setup the repository so if you
13:23 - have for example a different
13:24 - architecture you can use those steps to
13:27 - display the correct command for it and I
13:31 - guess that applies to other Linux
13:34 - distributions as well like for example
13:36 - here you also have the second tab where
13:38 - you see a separate comment for it
13:41 - so this steps should actually set up the
13:45 - repository so that as a next step you
13:47 - can then install the docker C from those
13:50 - repositories so installing docker from
13:54 - the setup repository is actually pretty
13:56 - straightforward the steps are same for
13:59 - or similar to all the distributions
14:02 - basically just update the app package
14:04 - and then you just say install docker
14:07 - seee
14:08 - so this command will just download the
14:11 - latest stock version if you want to
14:14 - install a specific one which you will
14:17 - need to do in a production environment
14:19 - then you can just provide a version like
14:22 - this you just say docker - EE equals
14:27 - some specific versions and using this
14:30 - command you can actually look up what
14:32 - versions are available in that
14:33 - repository that you just and with this
14:37 - command actually docker will be
14:39 - installed on your Linux environment and
14:42 - then you can just verify using sudo
14:46 - docker run hello world which is this
14:48 - demo image of docker you can verify that
14:52 - docker is running and this will start
14:55 - hello world docker container on your
15:00 - environment
15:05 - so as I mentioned previously for
15:08 - environments that do not support running
15:12 - docker natively there is an workaround
15:15 - which is called docker toolbox so darker
15:18 - Tool Works is basically an installer for
15:20 - darker environment set up on those
15:23 - systems
15:26 - so this is how to install darker toolbox
15:29 - on your Mac this is the whole package
15:32 - that comes with the installation of tako
15:34 - toolbox which is basically the darker
15:36 - command-line doctor machine docker
15:39 - compose basically all the packages that
15:41 - we saw in the native installation and in
15:44 - on top of that you also get the Oracle
15:46 - VM VirtualBox so in order to install the
15:49 - darker toolbox it's actually pretty
15:51 - straightforward on your on this website
15:55 - you can go to the toolbox releases we
15:58 - have all the list of latest releases you
16:00 - just take the latest release and here
16:04 - you see two assets this one is for
16:06 - Windows obviously and you just download
16:08 - the package for Mac and once it's
16:11 - downloaded you just click on it and go
16:14 - through the installation wizard leave
16:16 - all the options by defaults as they are
16:20 - do not change anything and after the
16:22 - installation we can just validate the
16:25 - the installation is successful and you
16:28 - can actually run docker so after seeing
16:31 - the installation was successful screen
16:32 - just go and look up in your Launchpad
16:35 - talk a QuickStart terminal and once you
16:38 - open it you should be able to run docker
16:41 - commenced and you can just try docker
16:44 - run hello world which should just start
16:48 - up or bring up this hello world docker
16:51 - container on your environment so now
16:55 - let's see how to install dr. toolbox on
16:57 - windows here is you that you get the
17:00 - whole package of docker technologies
17:02 - with the toolbox which are basically the
17:04 - same package which you get on the native
17:08 - docker installation and on top of that
17:11 - you get Oracle VM VirtualBox which is
17:14 - the tool that enables docker to run on
17:17 - an older system so before you install dr
17:20 - toolbox you have to make sure that you
17:22 - meet some of the preconditions number
17:25 - one you have to make sure your windows
17:27 - system supports virtualization and that
17:30 - virtualization must be enabled otherwise
17:34 - docker docker won't start so depending
17:38 - on which we
17:39 - version you have looking up or checking
17:42 - the virtualization status will be
17:44 - different so I just suggest you google
17:47 - it and look it up of how to find the
17:49 - virtualization status to see that it's
17:52 - enabled once you have that checked also
17:56 - make sure that your windows operating
17:58 - system is 64 bits so if those two
18:02 - criteria are met then you can go ahead
18:04 - and install the docker toolbox the place
18:07 - where you see the releases or the
18:09 - release artifacts is toolbox releases
18:11 - link here which I have opened so it's
18:14 - basically a list of the releases you
18:16 - just take the latest one which has two
18:19 - artifacts this is the one for Windows
18:22 - you just download this executable file
18:25 - click on it and go through the
18:27 - installation wizard once the
18:29 - installation is completed there just
18:31 - couple of steps here you can verify that
18:35 - docker was installed or the toolbox was
18:37 - installed by just looking up the docker
18:41 - a QuickStart terminal on your windows
18:43 - that it must be installed and once you
18:46 - click on it and open it you should be
18:48 - able to run docker commands in the
18:50 - terminal so the basic docker command
18:53 - that you can test will be docker run
18:55 - hello world which will just fetch this
18:58 - basic docker container from the public
19:01 - registry and run it on your computer if
19:05 - that command is successful it means that
19:07 - docker was successfully installed on
19:09 - your computer and now you can proceed
19:12 - with the tutorial thanks for watching
19:14 - the video I hope it was helpful and if
19:16 - he was don't forget to like it this is a
19:18 - video series so I will create a new one
19:20 - every week so if you want to be notified
19:23 - whenever a new video comes out then
19:25 - subscribe to my channel if you have any
19:28 - questions if something wasn't clear in
19:30 - the video please post them in the
19:31 - comment section below and I will try to
19:33 - answer them so thank you and see you in
19:36 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video I will show you how to install darker on different operating systems the installation will differ not only based on the operating system but also the version of the operating system so you can actually watch this video selectively depending on which OS and the version of that OS you have I will show you how to find out which installation step applies to you in the before installing section which is the first one so once you find that out you can actually directly skip to that part of the video where I explain that into details I will put the mini locations of each part in the description part of the video and also I will put all the links that I use in the video in the description so that you can easily access them also if you have any questions during the video or if you get stuck installing the docker on your system please post your question or problem in the comment section so that I can get back to you and help you proceed or maybe someone from the community will so with that said let's dive right into it so if you want to install docker you can actually google it and you get an official documentation of docker it's important to note there are two editions of docker there is a community and Enterprise editions for us to begin with Community Edition will be just fine in the docker Community Edition tab there there is a list of operating systems and distributions in order to install docker so for example if we start with Mac we can click in here and we see the documentation of how to install it on Mac which is actually one of the easiest but we'll see some some other ones as well so before you install darker on your Mac or Windows computer there are prerequisites to be considered so for Mac and Windows there has to be some criteria of the operating system and the hardware met in order to support running if you have make go through the system requirements to see if your make version is actually supporting docker if you have windows then you can go to the Windows tab and look at the system requirements there or what to know before you install for example one thing to note is that docker natively runs only on Windows 10 so if you have a Windows version which is less than 10 then we docker cannot run natively on your computer so if your computer doesn't meet the requirements to run docker there is a workaround for that which is called docker toolbox that of docker you basically just have to install a docker toolbox that will become a sort of a bridge between your operating system and the docker and that will enable you to run docker on your legacy computer so if that applies to you then skip ahead in this video to the part where I explain how to install docker toolbox on Mac and on windows so let's

and download the stable version well I already have darker installed from the edge channel so I won't be stalling it again but it shouldn't matter because the steps of installation are the same for both so once the docker dmg file is downloaded you just double click on it and it will pop up this window just drag the docker well up into the applications and will be installed on your Mac as the

docker is running and you can configure some preferences and check the docker version and so on and if you want to stop talker or quited on your Mac you can just do it from here and importance may be interesting note here is that if let's say you download or install docker and if you have more than one accounts on your laptop you will actually get some errors or conflicts if you run docker at the same time or multiple accounts so what I do for example is that if I switch to another account where I'm also gonna need docker I quit it from here and then I started from from the other account so that I don't get any errors so that might be something you need to consider if you use multiple accounts so let's see how to install Tucker for Windows the first step as I mentioned before is to go to the before you install section and to see that your operating system and your computer meets all the criteria to run docker natively so if you are installing dog for the first time don't worry about most of these parts like doctor toolbox and doctor machine there are two things that are important one is to double check that your Windows version is compatible for docker and the second one is to have virtualization enabled virtualization is by default always enabled other than you manually disabled it so if you're unsure then you can check it by going to the task manager performance CPU tab

have to explicitly start docker because it's not going to start automatically so for that you can just go and search for the docker for Windows app on your Windows and just click on it and you will see the darker whale icon starting and if you click on that icon you can actually see the status that says Stoker is now up and running so this is basically it for the installation now let's see how to install Tucker on different Linux distributions and this is where things get a little bit more complicated so first of all you see that in this menu on the on the left you see that for four different Linux distributions the installation steps will differ but also for example if we just click on one two for the guide you can see that in the prerequisites section there is also differentiation between the versions of the same Linux distribution and there may be some even more complicated scenarios where the combination of the version of the distribution and the architecture it's running in also makes some difference in to how to setup docker on that specific environment because of that I can't go through a docker installation process of every Linux environment because they're just too many combinations so instead what we'll do is just go through a general overview of the steps and configuration process to get darker running on your Linux environment and you can just adjust it then for your specific setup so these are some general steps to follow in order to install docker on your Linux Linux environment first of all you have to go through the operating system requirements part on your on the relevant Linux distribution that applies for you a second step in the documentation to is to any sell old versions however if it's the first time you installing darker then you know I have to worry about that you also don't have to worry about the support its storage drivers and you can skip ahead to the part of installing darker Community Edition so for any Linux distribution here the steps will be or the options for installing docker will be the same so first option is basically to set up a repository and download the docker from install it from the dock repository the second option is to install the packages manually however I wouldn't recommend it and I think the documentation doesn't recommend it either because then you will have to do a lot of steps of the installation in the maintenance of the versions manually so I wouldn't do that the third one is just with the testing purposes it may be enough for the development purposes as well but I would still not do it which is basically just download downloading some automated scripts that will install and setup docker on your Linux environment however again I wouldn't go with it I would actually just do the first option which is just downloading the darker from the repository so in order to install darker using the first option which is downloading it from the Dockers repositories you have two main steps so the first one is to set up the repository which differs a little bit depending on which distribution you have and then install the docker seee from the repository so from Ubuntu and Debian the steps for setting up the repository are generally just updating your package and then setting up an HTTP connection with the repository and adding the Dockers official jpg key which only Ubuntu and Debian need you don't have to do this steps for CentOS and fedora there just have to install the required packages in the last step for setting up the repository is basically setting up the stable repository of docker which we saw previously on the overview that there are two channels which is a stable and edge here you always have to set up the stable repository optionally you can also set up the edge repository but I'll just do stable this time and here also something to notice depending on architecture you have to actually set it or you have to set that as a parameter when you setup the repository so if you have for example a different architecture you can use those steps to display the correct command for it and I guess that applies to other Linux distributions as well like for example here you also have the second tab where you see a separate comment for it so this steps should actually set up the repository so that as a next step you can then install the docker C from those repositories so installing docker from the setup repository is actually pretty straightforward the steps are same for or similar to all the distributions basically just update the app package and then you just say install docker seee so this command will just download the latest stock version if you want to install a specific one which you will need to do in a production environment then you can just provide a version like this you just say docker EE equals some specific versions and using this command you can actually look up what versions are available in that repository that you just and with this command actually docker will be installed on your Linux environment and then you can just verify using sudo docker run hello world which is this demo image of docker you can verify that docker is running and this will start hello world docker container on your environment so as I mentioned previously for environments that do not support running docker natively there is an workaround which is called docker toolbox so darker Tool Works is basically an installer for darker environment set up on those systems so this is how to install darker toolbox on your Mac this is the whole package that comes with the installation of tako toolbox which is basically the darker commandline doctor machine docker compose basically all the packages that we saw in the native installation and in on top of that you also get the Oracle VM VirtualBox so in order to install the darker toolbox it's actually pretty straightforward on your on this website you can go to the toolbox releases we have all the list of latest releases you just take the latest release and here you see two assets this one is for Windows obviously and you just download the package for Mac and once it's downloaded you just click on it and go through the installation wizard leave all the options by defaults as they are do not change anything and after the installation we can just validate the the installation is successful and you can actually run docker so after seeing the installation was successful screen just go and look up in your Launchpad talk a QuickStart terminal and once you open it you should be able to run docker commenced and you can just try docker run hello world which should just start up or bring up this hello world docker container on your environment so now let's see how to install dr. toolbox on windows here is you that you get the whole package of docker technologies with the toolbox which are basically the same package which you get on the native docker installation and on top of that you get Oracle VM VirtualBox which is the tool that enables docker to run on an older system so before you install dr toolbox you have to make sure that you meet some of the preconditions number one you have to make sure your windows system supports virtualization and that virtualization must be enabled otherwise docker docker won't start so depending on which we version you have looking up or checking the virtualization status will be different so I just suggest you google it and look it up of how to find the virtualization status to see that it's enabled once you have that checked also make sure that your windows operating system is 64 bits so if those two criteria are met then you can go ahead and install the docker toolbox the place where you see the releases or the release artifacts is toolbox releases link here which I have opened so it's basically a list of the releases you just take the latest one which has two artifacts this is the one for Windows you just download this executable file click on it and go through the installation wizard once the installation is completed there just couple of steps here you can verify that docker was installed or the toolbox was installed by just looking up the docker a QuickStart terminal on your windows that it must be installed and once you click on it and open it you should be able to run docker commands in the terminal so the basic docker command that you can test will be docker run hello world which will just fetch this basic docker container from the public registry and run it on your computer if that command is successful it means that docker was successfully installed on your computer and now you can proceed with the tutorial thanks for watching the video I hope it was
