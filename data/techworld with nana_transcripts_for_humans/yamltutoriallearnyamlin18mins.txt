With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video I will explain all about
00:02 - demo we will see what ml is used for and
00:06 - we'll go through the syntax of how to
00:08 - write a valid ml file as you've seen in
00:12 - my tutorial videos about docker
00:14 - kubernetes in Siebel
00:15 - Prometheus etc I have shown example
00:18 - configuration files all written in mo
00:21 - because it has become a pretty widely
00:23 - used format for writing configurations
00:26 - for many different DevOps tools and
00:28 - applications that's why when using these
00:30 - tools it's important to understand the
00:32 - details of yellow syntax and its main
00:35 - concepts generally speaking yeah mo is a
00:38 - serialization language just like XML and
00:41 - JSON serialization language basically
00:44 - means that applications written with
00:47 - different technologies languages etc
00:49 - which have different data structures can
00:52 - transfer data to each other using a
00:54 - common agreed-on or a standard format
00:57 - and the most popular such formats are
00:59 - llamo jason and xml and the name llamo
01:04 - actually stands for y mo ain't markup
01:07 - language and you can create llamo file
01:09 - with one of those two extensions they're
01:13 - the same one of the main reasons of why
01:15 - hemos popularity has increased so much
01:18 - over the past years is that it's super
01:21 - human readable and intuitive which makes
01:24 - it a great fit for writing configuration
01:26 - files for all those recent DevOps tools
01:30 - like I mentioned docker kubernetes etc
01:32 - so to show you an example and also
01:35 - comparison between llamo XML and JSON
01:39 - formats let's consider this example so
01:42 - this is how y mo file would look like
01:45 - it's very straightforward it's pretty
01:47 - clean this is the same data in XML
01:51 - format where you have this so-called
01:54 - text and then you have the JSON format
01:56 - and as you see in XML and JSON data
02:00 - structures are defined using special
02:02 - characters in XML you have so-called
02:04 - text with angle brackets in Jason you
02:07 - have curly brackets and in yellow you
02:10 - don't have those special characters so
02:12 - how data structure is defined
02:13 - in the mo is through line separations
02:16 - and spaces with indentations that's why
02:20 - you can indent in space in XML and JSON
02:24 - as you wish but in the ml you get
02:26 - validation error if you have one single
02:29 - space and data structure wrong which may
02:31 - be a little bit annoying but it makes
02:33 - llamó format the cleanest most human
02:36 - readable format of all three so what are
02:38 - some of your most use cases to count few
02:41 - yema format is used for duck composed
02:43 - files for NZ ball prometheus kubernetes
02:47 - and many more tools okay so now that you
02:50 - know what llamo is and where it's used
02:52 - let's dive into its syntax so it started
02:56 - with the basic syntax which is simple
02:59 - key value pairs so let's take an example
03:01 - that I just showed you and let's write
03:04 - key value pairs like AB and let's call
03:08 - it user authentication and we have a
03:14 - port let's put it at 9000 and version of
03:19 - the app and 1.7 just an example so these
03:23 - are simple key value pairs this whole
03:25 - yellow file is written and you have
03:27 - different datatypes here we have a
03:29 - string which note that we don't have to
03:32 - enclose it with quotes you can if you
03:35 - want to so you can use either double
03:37 - quotes or single quotes or no quotes at
03:41 - all and you have the number of
03:42 - representations as well if you need to
03:44 - use some special character like line
03:47 - carriage for example then you have to
03:49 - enclose it in strings otherwise Yemen
03:52 - cannot recognize it but other than that
03:54 - you don't need quotes so I'm gonna
03:56 - mention here that in yellow you also
03:58 - have comments so everything that starts
04:01 - with this sign or with this character
04:03 - basically yellow interprets as a comment
04:05 - so I can write comment here and
04:09 - basically I can use this comment between
04:12 - the attributes anywhere in the mo file
04:14 - where I want to make my file even more
04:17 - readable and understandable so this is a
04:19 - simple list of key value pairs what you
04:21 - can do is you can group them inside of
04:23 - an object so you can create an object in
04:25 - yellow and you can do that by in
04:27 - in this individual key value pairs and
04:31 - enclosing it in an object let's call it
04:34 - a micro service like this and this
04:39 - becomes an object with micro service
04:41 - with its attributes and note that the
04:44 - space has to be exactly same for each
04:48 - attribute within the object and also
04:50 - note that because Jemil is so sensitive
04:53 - about the spaces and indentation it's
04:56 - always a good idea to use a llamo
04:58 - validator before you for example execute
05:01 - a configuration file in kubernetes or
05:03 - you apply that or use that file to be
05:07 - sure that your invitations are right and
05:09 - there are online tools for that one of
05:12 - them which I use is this one here but
05:14 - there are some other online tools as
05:16 - well I can link them in description
05:18 - so what you can do is you can just copy
05:20 - that and it tells you that it's valid if
05:23 - I for example this it's gonna scream
05:26 - that indentation so you can check your
05:28 - valid et here so let's go back in yellow
05:32 - you can also have lists so for example
05:34 - if you have multiple micro services like
05:37 - this I can create a list of those micro
05:41 - services simply by using - so like this
05:45 - and again important thing that those
05:48 - attributes stay at the same level and
05:49 - the - is right here you can also have
05:54 - boolean values so for example if we have
05:57 - deployed attributes you can say true or
06:02 - false and in Yemen you can also express
06:05 - boolean expressions with yes or no so
06:09 - let's say deployed yes and also with on
06:12 - and off so all these 3 pairs of values
06:14 - are expressions of boolean values and
06:19 - you also see the syntax highlighting is
06:21 - different so this is a list and these
06:24 - are the items of the list and I can add
06:27 - second item app let's say shopping cards
06:33 - whatever
06:35 - and let's say port is nine thousand two
06:38 - then we have version which is 1.9 and
06:44 - this way you can define lists of objects
06:47 - but you can also define lists of simple
06:49 - values so for example if you had a list
06:52 - of just the micro-service names you
06:54 - could do like this and that would be
07:02 - fine as well and you can also use lists
07:05 - inside of a list item for example if you
07:07 - have multiple versions of a shopping
07:10 - cart for example that you want to list
07:11 - here for some reason I don't know you
07:14 - can actually list them here so I can do
07:17 - versions let's say you have 2.0 and then
07:21 - you have 2.1 etc and i'm gonna copy that
07:26 - also in the validator and here you see
07:29 - that the - position you can actually use
07:33 - different annotations for that so i have
07:35 - an indentation here but I don't have
07:37 - here so that's fine as well I could do
07:39 - like this or I can align it on the
07:42 - parent of attribute so don't be confused
07:45 - if you see different alignments of the
07:48 - lists both work because llamo recognizes
07:52 - that it's a list item what will not work
07:55 - is if you don't align the list items
07:58 - using indentation so for example it was
08:01 - one space off then the validator will be
08:05 - red so some small details there also
08:08 - know that if you have primitive items in
08:11 - the list like this one for example some
08:13 - not the object items but the primitive
08:15 - ones you can also express it in
08:17 - different way and this is how with the
08:20 - different syntax you have square
08:22 - brackets and you can put those values
08:25 - inside like a list which makes it
08:28 - actually more readable if you have just
08:30 - simple datatypes and not objects let's
08:32 - validate that as well to make sure you
08:35 - can have strings here as well or mix of
08:38 - them doesn't matter now this is really
08:41 - some of the basics of llamo syntax so to
08:45 - make it more practical and realistic
08:47 - let's actually look at
08:49 - real kubernetes yellow example to see
08:52 - how these basic syntax is expressed
08:54 - there so I'm gonna clean this up and
08:57 - let's look at a pot configuration so
09:00 - this is basically the main part where
09:02 - the metadata and kind etcetera is
09:05 - defined as you see these are super
09:08 - simple key value pairs and then you have
09:11 - these objects that we just saw with
09:13 - Hiroki or the indentations to have a
09:15 - metadata object and inside that you have
09:18 - another labels object and here you have
09:21 - the specification and containers maybe
09:25 - you are familiar with this already and
09:27 - in containers is a list so each
09:32 - container item sort of say has to start
09:35 - with
09:35 - - and indentation and then we have the
09:40 - name of the container have the image
09:44 - let's use nginx then you have ports
09:49 - which is another list so again we start
09:52 - with - to list ports and then you have
09:57 - the attribute which is container port
10:01 - value there inside container you also
10:04 - can have volume mounts which is another
10:10 - list so here you list all your volumes
10:12 - and this is a list of objects again we
10:15 - have key value pairs let's use I don't
10:18 - know nginx volume and mount path
10:29 - some example and this is how a pod
10:34 - configuration will look like so you have
10:36 - again basic building blocks key value
10:39 - pairs objects and lists and then lists
10:42 - inside of that list item and since
10:45 - containers is also at least you can have
10:48 - multiple containers inside and for
10:51 - example if I were to define a sidecar
10:54 - container I would have another item
10:57 - expression - and here I would say this
11:01 - is my sidecar container and again image
11:07 - some image etc also another example that
11:11 - I also showed in one of my videos is
11:14 - where we deployed a curl image as a
11:17 - sidecar and inside of that container
11:22 - configuration wheels had these two lines
11:24 - I'm actually gonna copy them and here
11:27 - you see that this is this alternative
11:29 - syntax of defining lists so arguments is
11:34 - a list and we use it like this and then
11:38 - we have the two items here one and two
11:42 - so knowing how yellow syntax works
11:45 - should make it easier to understand the
11:47 - kubernetes configuration file structure
11:50 - better another important concept of
11:53 - Gemmell syntax is when you have
11:55 - multi-line strings so for example file
11:59 - contents multi-line string let's call it
12:04 - the attribute and instead of writing
12:07 - this multi-line string here with the
12:10 - carriage I can write it actually on
12:13 - multiple lines like this so I don't need
12:16 - that thing anymore so this is a
12:23 - multi-line string and this is the next
12:29 - line etc right and the way I can do that
12:33 - is using the pipe symbol so yellow will
12:37 - see that character and will interpret
12:40 - everything here
12:41 - as a multi-line text so this line breaks
12:44 - will actually stay another case could be
12:46 - if you have this super long string which
12:49 - has to be on a single line so for
12:52 - example this is a single line string
12:55 - that should be all on one line and some
13:02 - other stuff
13:04 - let's put dots here and in that case
13:07 - obviously you want the line carriages
13:10 - here but you also don't want to write
13:12 - this all out on one line because it's
13:14 - just not very readable and that's why
13:18 - you want to for readability you still
13:21 - want to display that here in my demo
13:23 - file itself but you want yellow to
13:25 - interpreted as a single line in this
13:28 - case instead of pipe you actually
13:30 - replace it with a greater than sign or
13:33 - with this angled bracket and this will
13:36 - be interpreted as single line now this
13:39 - is just some random example so let's
13:42 - actually see some real use cases I have
13:45 - a config file demo here from kubernetes
13:48 - which I have used in what my tutorial
13:50 - videos and here you see the basic key
13:53 - value stuff and here you have the name
13:56 - of the attribute and call it whatever
13:58 - you want
13:59 - and here we use that pipe and these are
14:03 - actually the contents of the file this
14:06 - is going to be displayed exactly like
14:07 - this with line carriages because this
14:09 - has to be each one on its own line and
14:13 - this way you can actually write
14:14 - configuration files for different
14:17 - applications like this one is for
14:19 - mosquito you also have maybe flu in D
14:22 - and they have their own different
14:24 - formats and you can write the whole
14:26 - thing as a file represented by
14:28 - multi-line string in yellow
14:31 - another example of using this multi-line
14:34 - string that you may actually encounter
14:36 - in communities configuration files is
14:39 - this one right here so this is part of
14:42 - configuration of a pod so you have this
14:44 - command attribute and here you see the
14:47 - familiar list and here again you have
14:50 - this pipe that is followed by a
14:53 - multi-line string and this is an example
14:55 - of
14:55 - bhana that I found so basically what it
14:57 - does is that it executes shell command
15:00 - and this is a shell script so you can
15:02 - actually put the whole contents of a
15:04 - shell script as you would have that as a
15:06 - shell script file after that pipe symbol
15:10 - as a multi-line text and this will
15:12 - execute as a shell script basically one
15:15 - thing that I've also needed to use in ml
15:19 - Wars environmental variables so for
15:21 - example if a part that has environmental
15:23 - variables defined inside and you have to
15:26 - use one of those inside the pod
15:28 - configuration you can actually access
15:30 - them using a dollar sign inside your
15:33 - yellow configuration so this is an
15:35 - example of a my sequel pod and here the
15:40 - same thing that I showed you before see
15:41 - how they comment and here in this line
15:45 - we're executing in my sequel command and
15:47 - I am accessing the environmental
15:50 - variable that is available inside the
15:52 - pod using the name of the environmental
15:55 - variable and the dollar sign before that
15:57 - which if you need that might come in
16:00 - handy because I believe this specific
16:02 - concept of using environmental variables
16:04 - in llamó isn't very well documented
16:07 - Gemmell also has a concept of
16:09 - placeholders one of his use cases is in
16:13 - help for example and this is how it
16:15 - looks like so basically instead of
16:16 - directly writing the values inside you
16:20 - define placeholders and the syntax for
16:22 - using placeholders is double curly
16:25 - braces around that placeholder and this
16:28 - value gets replaced using template
16:31 - generator and I believe the same concept
16:34 - is used in instable as well so again if
16:36 - you use helm or in zville for example
16:39 - and you see the syntax you should know
16:40 - what it stands for
16:42 - and lastly inside one llamó file you can
16:46 - actually define multiple components and
16:48 - you can separate these components using
16:51 - three dishes like this so for example if
16:55 - I have a yellow file where I want to put
16:57 - all my configurations I can separate
17:00 - them using this three dashes and this
17:04 - will be a valid EML and this can be very
17:06 - handy in case especially where you have
17:09 - multiple components maybe for one
17:10 - service and you want to group them in a
17:13 - single yellow file so for that use case
17:15 - this is the way to go
17:17 - maybe the interesting note here is that
17:19 - in all my kubernetes videos I have used
17:21 - the yellow format to write kubernetes
17:23 - configuration files however you can also
17:26 - write commands configuration files in
17:28 - JSON format sample if I head over to my
17:31 - dashboard and I click to edit one of my
17:36 - components I see that I have both llamo
17:39 - and Jason formats available which I can
17:42 - edit directly or if I want to create a
17:45 - new element new component I can provide
17:47 - either yellow or Jason but I personally
17:51 - use yellow because as I mentioned it's
17:54 - cleaner and more readable but you can
17:56 - actually use both so this was it for
17:59 - Gemmell tutorial video thank you for
18:02 - watching and see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I will explain all about demo we will see what ml is used for and we'll go through the syntax of how to write a valid ml file as you've seen in my tutorial videos about docker kubernetes in Siebel Prometheus etc I have shown example configuration files all written in mo because it has become a pretty widely used format for writing configurations for many different DevOps tools and applications that's why when using these tools it's important to understand the details of yellow syntax and its main concepts generally speaking yeah mo is a serialization language just like XML and JSON serialization language basically means that applications written with different technologies languages etc which have different data structures can transfer data to each other using a common agreedon or a standard format and the most popular such formats are llamo jason and xml and the name llamo actually stands for y mo ain't markup language and you can create llamo file with one of those two extensions they're the same one of the main reasons of why hemos popularity has increased so much over the past years is that it's super human readable and intuitive which makes it a great fit for writing configuration files for all those recent DevOps tools like I mentioned docker kubernetes etc so to show you an example and also comparison between llamo XML and JSON formats let's consider this example so this is how y mo file would look like it's very straightforward it's pretty clean this is the same data in XML format where you have this socalled text and then you have the JSON format and as you see in XML and JSON data structures are defined using special characters in XML you have socalled text with angle brackets in Jason you have curly brackets and in yellow you don't have those special characters so how data structure is defined in the mo is through line separations and spaces with indentations that's why you can indent in space in XML and JSON as you wish but in the ml you get validation error if you have one single space and data structure wrong which may be a little bit annoying but it makes llamó format the cleanest most human readable format of all three so what are some of your most use cases to count few yema format is used for duck composed files for NZ ball prometheus kubernetes and many more tools okay so now that you know what llamo is and where it's used let's dive into its syntax so it started with the basic syntax which is simple key value pairs so let's take an example that I just showed you and let's write key value pairs like AB and let's call it user authentication and we have a port let's put it at 9000 and version of the app and 1.7 just an example so these are simple key value pairs this whole yellow file is written and you have different datatypes here we have a string which note that we don't have to enclose it with quotes you can if you want to so you can use either double quotes or single quotes or no quotes at all and you have the number of representations as well if you need to use some special character like line carriage for example then you have to enclose it in strings otherwise Yemen cannot recognize it but other than that you don't need quotes so I'm gonna mention here that in yellow you also have comments so everything that starts with this sign or with this character basically yellow interprets as a comment so I can write comment here and basically I can use this comment between the attributes anywhere in the mo file where I want to make my file even more readable and understandable so this is a simple list of key value pairs what you can do is you can group them inside of an object so you can create an object in yellow and you can do that by in in this individual key value pairs and enclosing it in an object let's call it a micro service like this and this becomes an object with micro service with its attributes and note that the space has to be exactly same for each attribute within the object and also note that because Jemil is so sensitive about the spaces and indentation it's always a good idea to use a llamo validator before you for example execute a configuration file in kubernetes or you apply that or use that file to be sure that your invitations are right and there are online tools for that one of them which I use is this one here but there are some other online tools as well I can link them in description so what you can do is you can just copy that and it tells you that it's valid if I for example this it's gonna scream that indentation so you can check your valid et here so let's go back in yellow you can also have lists so for example if you have multiple micro services like this I can create a list of those micro services simply by using so like this and again important thing that those attributes stay at the same level and the is right here you can also have boolean values so for example if we have deployed attributes you can say true or false and in Yemen you can also express boolean expressions with yes or no so let's say deployed yes and also with on and off so all these 3 pairs of values are expressions of boolean values and you also see the syntax highlighting is different so this is a list and these are the items of the list and I can add second item app let's say shopping cards whatever and let's say port is nine thousand two then we have version which is 1.9 and this way you can define lists of objects but you can also define lists of simple values so for example if you had a list of just the microservice names you could do like this and that would be fine as well and you can also use lists inside of a list item for example if you have multiple versions of a shopping cart for example that you want to list here for some reason I don't know you can actually list them here so I can do versions let's say you have 2.0 and then you have 2.1 etc and i'm gonna copy that also in the validator and here you see that the position you can actually use different annotations for that so i have an indentation here but I don't have here so that's fine as well I could do like this or I can align it on the parent of attribute so don't be confused if you see different alignments of the lists both work because llamo recognizes that it's a list item what will not work is if you don't align the list items using indentation so for example it was one space off then the validator will be red so some small details there also know that if you have primitive items in the list like this one for example some not the object items but the primitive ones you can also express it in different way and this is how with the different syntax you have square brackets and you can put those values inside like a list which makes it actually more readable if you have just simple datatypes and not objects let's validate that as well to make sure you can have strings here as well or mix of them doesn't matter now this is really some of the basics of llamo syntax so to make it more practical and realistic let's actually look at real kubernetes yellow example to see how these basic syntax is expressed there so I'm gonna clean this up and let's look at a pot configuration so this is basically the main part where the metadata and kind etcetera is defined as you see these are super simple key value pairs and then you have these objects that we just saw with Hiroki or the indentations to have a metadata object and inside that you have another labels object and here you have the specification and containers maybe you are familiar with this already and in containers is a list so each container item sort of say has to start with and indentation and then we have the name of the container have the image let's use nginx then you have ports which is another list so again we start with to list ports and then you have the attribute which is container port value there inside container you also can have volume mounts which is another list so here you list all your volumes and this is a list of objects again we have key value pairs let's use I don't know nginx volume and mount path some example and this is how a pod configuration will look like so you have again basic building blocks key value pairs objects and lists and then lists inside of that list item and since containers is also at least you can have multiple containers inside and for example if I were to define a sidecar container I would have another item expression and here I would say this is my sidecar container and again image some image etc also another example that I also showed in one of my videos is where we deployed a curl image as a sidecar and inside of that container configuration wheels had these two lines I'm actually gonna copy them and here you see that this is this alternative syntax of defining lists so arguments is a list and we use it like this and then we have the two items here one and two so knowing how yellow syntax works should make it easier to understand the kubernetes configuration file structure better another important concept of Gemmell syntax is when you have multiline strings so for example file contents multiline string let's call it the attribute and instead of writing this multiline string here with the carriage I can write it actually on multiple lines like this so I don't need that thing anymore so this is a multiline string and this is the next line etc right and the way I can do that is using the pipe symbol so yellow will see that character and will interpret everything here as a multiline text so this line breaks will actually stay another case could be if you have this super long string which has to be on a single line so for example this is a single line string that should be all on one line and some other stuff let's put dots here and in that case obviously you want the line carriages here but you also don't want to write this all out on one line because it's just not very readable and that's why you want to for readability you still want to display that here in my demo file itself but you want yellow to interpreted as a single line in this case instead of pipe you actually replace it with a greater than sign or with this angled bracket and this will be interpreted as single line now this is just some random example so let's actually see some real use cases I have a config file demo here from kubernetes which I have used in what my tutorial videos and here you see the basic key value stuff and here you have the name of the attribute and call it whatever you want and here we use that pipe and these are actually the contents of the file this is going to be displayed exactly like this with line carriages because this has to be each one on its own line and this way you can actually write configuration files for different applications like this one is for mosquito you also have maybe flu in D and they have their own different formats and you can write the whole thing as a file represented by multiline string in yellow another example of using this multiline string that you may actually encounter in communities configuration files is this one right here so this is part of configuration of a pod so you have this command attribute and here you see the familiar list and here again you have this pipe that is followed by a multiline string and this is an example of bhana that I found so basically what it does is that it executes shell command and this is a shell script so you can actually put the whole contents of a shell script as you would have that as a shell script file after that pipe symbol as a multiline text and this will execute as a shell script basically one thing that I've also needed to use in ml Wars environmental variables so for example if a part that has environmental variables defined inside and you have to use one of those inside the pod configuration you can actually access them using a dollar sign inside your yellow configuration so this is an example of a my sequel pod and here the same thing that I showed you before see how they comment and here in this line we're executing in my sequel command and I am accessing the environmental variable that is available inside the pod using the name of the environmental variable and the dollar sign before that which if you need that might come in handy because I believe this specific concept of using environmental variables in llamó isn't very well documented Gemmell also has a concept of placeholders one of his use cases is in help for example and this is how it looks like so basically instead of directly writing the values inside you define placeholders and the syntax for using placeholders is double curly braces around that placeholder and this value gets replaced using template generator and I believe the same concept is used in instable as well so again if you use helm or in zville for example and you see the syntax you should know what it stands for and lastly inside one llamó file you can actually define multiple components and you can separate these components using three dishes like this so for example if I have a yellow file where I want to put all my configurations I can separate them using this three dashes and this will be a valid EML and this can be very handy in case especially where you have multiple components maybe for one service and you want to group them in a single yellow file so for that use case this is the way to go maybe the interesting note here is that in all my kubernetes videos I have used the yellow format to write kubernetes configuration files however you can also write commands configuration files in JSON format sample if I head over to my dashboard and I click to edit one of my components I see that I have both llamo and Jason formats available which I can edit directly or if I want to create a new element new component I can provide either yellow or Jason but I personally use yellow because as I mentioned it's cleaner and more readable but you can actually use both so this was it for Gemmell tutorial video thank you for watching and see you in the next video
