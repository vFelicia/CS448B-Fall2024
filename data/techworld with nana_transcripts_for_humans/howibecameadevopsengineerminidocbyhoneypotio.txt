00:00 - I recently worked with Honeypot to tell
00:02 - my personal Journey if you don't know
00:04 - Honeypot it's a tech job platform in the
00:06 - dark region the Netherlands and
00:08 - Barcelona but you may know Honeypot from
00:10 - the kubernetes and Prometheus
00:12 - documentaries they put out on their
00:14 - YouTube channel in this video I talk
00:15 - about my personal journey into software
00:18 - engineering and then devops I also talk
00:20 - about University education versus being
00:22 - self-taught as well as give some advice
00:24 - to people who are just starting out in
00:26 - the software development and many more
00:28 - interesting topics I hope you guys
00:31 - enjoyed and find it useful
00:33 - foreign
00:36 - [Music]
00:46 - devops engineer and currently actually
00:49 - what I do is full-time create content
00:53 - for other devops Engineers or people who
00:55 - are interested in becoming devops
00:57 - Engineers to learn about lots of
01:00 - different Technologies in the field as
01:02 - well as consult and help companies to
01:05 - build the devops processes in their in
01:08 - their organizations
01:11 - foreign
01:16 - why I became a engineer in the first
01:20 - place and why how I actually ended up in
01:22 - it field is a pretty random one actually
01:26 - was by coincidence because I had no idea
01:29 - of I.T field and how what kind of
01:32 - tasks or what kind of thing it was I was
01:35 - getting myself into I actually had a
01:37 - marketing background
01:39 - and when I decided I want to stay in
01:43 - Austria actually started looking for a
01:47 - profession that would be much more
01:48 - demanded than marketing professionals
01:51 - were and it actually popped out right
01:54 - away from just the job demands and the
01:58 - job descriptions and amount of of job
02:00 - demand for this profession so I kind of
02:03 - that was like my first point of Interest
02:05 - like okay what is this I.T and of course
02:07 - I had this thing in my in my mind which
02:10 - was
02:11 - um I mean I don't know any women
02:12 - actually in this field I don't even know
02:14 - any friends of mine in this field so and
02:17 - I had this thing that this is for like
02:19 - for men but immediately I think after
02:21 - starting uh the studies in it after two
02:25 - months or so I realized programming is
02:27 - super fun it's super interesting uh it's
02:30 - it's difficult and it's challenging as I
02:32 - expected but it's not something that you
02:35 - can't do like it it's not impossible
02:37 - right you have to learn it just as you
02:39 - learn any other profession so I realized
02:42 - it's not that difficult compared to to
02:45 - other stuff and that was actually the
02:47 - the
02:48 - um time when I decided okay this is
02:50 - highly demanded by I also enjoy doing it
02:53 - and then from then on I got an
02:56 - internship from the second semester
02:58 - um and then I realized I I was learning
03:01 - a lot at job at the internship by doing
03:04 - the things in practice than just
03:07 - learning things at the college or
03:09 - university just theoretically so I
03:11 - focused on that actually more so the the
03:14 - most
03:15 - the biggest disadvantage of college and
03:17 - university is they can't really keep up
03:19 - with their technological developments so
03:21 - their curriculum is 100 gonna be
03:23 - outdated because that's just how it is
03:27 - um and second it just takes much more
03:29 - time because you learn a lot of
03:31 - kind of needed a necessary theoretical
03:34 - stuff that you may never actually use at
03:37 - work right and it takes a lot of time
03:40 - away from you that you could actually be
03:42 - investing in learning programming for
03:44 - example in Java instead of learning
03:45 - mathematics and that was actually also a
03:47 - reason why I personally so I quit my
03:50 - studies in the third beginning of third
03:52 - semester
03:53 - because I realized okay I'm learning
03:56 - much more from this online resources and
03:59 - combined with work experience so I just
04:03 - realized I don't need actually this
04:04 - formal education so that's what I would
04:07 - recommend others as well
04:13 - but another challenge is also when
04:16 - you're learning yourself
04:18 - it can be challenging because one you
04:21 - need self-discipline and second you may
04:24 - not actually know what to learn right so
04:26 - you need some some way or some resource
04:29 - that tells you okay learn this first to
04:31 - this level and this and combine this way
04:34 - so it could be hard for for a lot of
04:37 - people to find or put together these
04:39 - resources themselves
04:41 - foreign
04:42 - [Music]
04:56 - so even if software development and
05:00 - DeVos engineering is super fun and I
05:02 - actually love it either I have so I have
05:06 - to give a warning as well because it
05:07 - comes with a lot of challenges
05:09 - especially when you're beginning and
05:10 - starting off and I had this personally
05:12 - myself you may feel you will definitely
05:16 - feel like super overwhelmed especially
05:18 - when you're in the team and they're like
05:20 - senior engineers and they're like super
05:21 - experienced you feel like a newbie you
05:24 - feel like you don't know anything and
05:26 - you feel like you can't you are not
05:28 - learning fast enough so the way that it
05:32 - affected me for example in in one of the
05:34 - projects that I can mention as an
05:36 - example where I actually learned or and
05:38 - took over the kubernetes full-time
05:40 - kubernetes management was that we were a
05:43 - team of a couple of software developers
05:45 - and we had super experience like expert
05:48 - level developers in the team and I
05:50 - actually felt even though I was also one
05:53 - of the lead developers I actually felt
05:55 - like pretty
05:57 - um inexperienced myself because I had
05:59 - less experience I had less knowledge and
06:00 - it was like a whole new world like a
06:02 - Next Level project like with the
06:04 - difficulty so I felt like okay there is
06:06 - another project where I feel like I
06:08 - don't know a lot of things I had this
06:10 - impulsive Syndrome again so use that
06:13 - actually as a motivation for me to take
06:16 - on tasks that I would be like probably
06:20 - the only one in the team that would like
06:23 - learn and master those skills so in a
06:27 - way that in a way I could say that I
06:28 - turned my imposter syndrome into into
06:33 - this advantage and motivation of
06:36 - actually learning stuff that were super
06:38 - valuable that I built the most knowledge
06:41 - in
06:43 - thank you after that I found out about
06:47 - devops which is basically to explain in
06:49 - like very simple terms uh devops is
06:53 - um the basically making the work of
06:56 - developers and operations
06:58 - um automated more efficient seamless
07:01 - right and since we have like a separate
07:04 - role as a devops engineer basically what
07:06 - you what the main responsibility is to
07:09 - take what developers have created and
07:12 - seamlessly in the most automated
07:14 - efficient fast secure whatever way
07:17 - um basically release it to their end
07:19 - users right so the whole process of
07:21 - taking that coded application putting it
07:24 - on the end environment and making it
07:26 - accessible to the end users in a secure
07:28 - way in a you know a highly a performance
07:32 - available way that's the the main
07:35 - responsibility of devops and then I once
07:38 - I found out about that I already knew
07:41 - okay all these technologies that are
07:42 - part of devops are already familiar for
07:44 - me and I just decided to go full time in
07:48 - that field and learn all the other rest
07:51 - of the Technologies basically
07:53 - um in that field if you want to get into
07:55 - devops you can use the software
07:57 - development entry as like a
08:00 - first point and then even as a junior
08:03 - software developer you can start
08:06 - transitioning into devops because you
08:09 - would have enough Foundation knowledge
08:10 - as a prerequisite to start learning the
08:13 - things that you need in devops devops is
08:16 - still relatively like compared to to
08:19 - other it Fields I would say relatively
08:22 - young and there is a lot of things going
08:24 - on there like a lot of Dynamics and I
08:26 - you could see like a lot of different
08:28 - technologies that are being developed
08:31 - and invented for different use cases or
08:33 - like problems that you have in the
08:36 - devops projects and you also have like a
08:39 - lot of
08:40 - um similar like very very similar
08:42 - Technologies developed in in the same
08:44 - area which is actually a sign
08:46 - um for the fact that there is no like
08:48 - one standardized solution for that so I
08:51 - believe that the trend the market Trend
08:55 - and the way that in the direction where
08:57 - devops is going to be developing into
09:00 - will be to standardize the processes
09:02 - more to have like a few set of tools
09:05 - that most of the projects like 90 or
09:08 - maybe even more
09:09 - projects will use
09:12 - um and all the rest of the technologies
09:14 - will just disappear because like there
09:16 - has to be one winner in each category so
09:19 - I think that's going to be the trend
09:20 - versus now where you have like 10
09:23 - different tools to choose from which are
09:25 - Super similar for the same task and then
09:27 - you have this thing because none of them
09:29 - is super standardized and the one that's
09:31 - mostly you so you kind of have to choose
09:33 - between them and evaluate them all the
09:35 - time but I think it's going to
09:37 - standardize a lot more and generally the
09:40 - devops because it's becoming mainstream
09:43 - already and we see that the devops
09:45 - itself is going to be become more
09:47 - clearly defined and there will be like
09:50 - more clarity from the companies what
09:52 - they expect from a devops engineer
09:53 - where's the line between uh developer
09:56 - and devops engineer where's the line
09:58 - between operations and devops I think
10:01 - that's going to be in like maybe four or
10:04 - five years we're gonna see that kind of
10:06 - standardization

Cleaned transcript:

I recently worked with Honeypot to tell my personal Journey if you don't know Honeypot it's a tech job platform in the dark region the Netherlands and Barcelona but you may know Honeypot from the kubernetes and Prometheus documentaries they put out on their YouTube channel in this video I talk about my personal journey into software engineering and then devops I also talk about University education versus being selftaught as well as give some advice to people who are just starting out in the software development and many more interesting topics I hope you guys enjoyed and find it useful foreign devops engineer and currently actually what I do is fulltime create content for other devops Engineers or people who are interested in becoming devops Engineers to learn about lots of
