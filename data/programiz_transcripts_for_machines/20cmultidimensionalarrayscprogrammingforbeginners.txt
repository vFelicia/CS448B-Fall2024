hey guys this is me padma from programmers and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we'll be learning about the multidimensional array and we will also learn to write the matrix multiplication program in c programming so without further delay let's get started in the last video we learned that an array stores multiple elements together similarly a multidimensional array also stores multiple elements the only difference is that the each element of multidimensional array is also an array this is why a multidimensional array is also known as an array of arrays let's start with the syntax of multidimensional array here the array is of in type which means it can only store integer data and arr is the name of the array and 2 and 3 represents the size of the adding here 2 means there will be 2 arrows inside this array and 3 means each array will have 3 elements now all together our array can store 2 into 3 six elements now let's see how we can initialize a twodimensional array i'll use this same array now i'll first assign values to this array so this array is equals to curly bracket inside this curly bracket another curly bracket with element 1 comma 3 comma 5 and enclosing this bracket and another comma here and curly bracket here here is 2 comma 4 comma 6. these are the elements of first array and these are the elements of secondary you might think that this assignment looks different than the assigning value to a single dimensional array it's because here we are assigning arrays not individual elements we have assigned two arrays and these two arrays has three elements each here this is the example of two dimensional array and we can think of this as a table with two rows and three columns where rows represents arrays and column represents element inside the array by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description now that you know how to store elements to a multidimensional array let's learn to access them remember array indexes well the concept of array indexes is also present in multidimensional array however here each element is associated with two indexes let me explain this i'll go back to my code editor here we have our earlier code now to access the first element we use the add a name and indexes 0 and 0. so add a name with indexes 0 and 0. here this first 0 indicates the first element of add array which is this array and the second zero indicates the first element of the first inner array which is one similarly to access the third element of second array we write a r r with index 1 and another index 2. here this 1 represents the second array and this 2 represents the third element of the second array now let's complete this program so i'll start from the basic structure of c program i will now cut this part and i'll paste it here and i'll print this both arrays so i'll use printf statement comma i'll cut this and i paste it here and i'll do the same for this add as well i will now run this code as you can see we get one using this arr zero zero and we get six using this arr one two to get the idea of indexes in multidimensional arrays you can refer to this image we can also change the elements of a multidimensional array by using array indexes let's see an example here we have the code from our earlier program i'll remove these two printf statements from here now suppose i want to change this value of 5 to 7 and the value of 4 to 8 here the value 5 is a third element of first array so we can use the index 0 and 2 so we'll write a r r with index 0 and 2 and i'll assign value 7 to this similarly 4 is a second element of second array so we can use index 1 and 1 and i'll assign value a to this i will now add print statement here and print these both arrays so percent d comma a r r with square bracket 0 and 2 and print f percent d comma a r r second array and second element i'll run this code as you can see the value at this position is changed from 5 to 7 and the value of this position is changed from four to eight okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses similar to an array we can also access each element of a multidimensional array using a for loop let me show you here in our earlier example i'll remove these lines of code from here now i'll write 2 for loop for bracket and i is equals to 0 and i is less than 2 plus plus i this is the increment expression and inside this for loop there is another for loop int j is equals to 0 and j is less than 2 sorry j is less than 3 and we have increment expression here the for loop iterates to time from i is equals to 0 to i is equals to 1 to access the two inner arrays of twodimensional array and the inner for loop iterates three times from j is equals to 0 to j is equals to 2 to access the three elements of both the inner array now inside the inner for loop i'll now print the element at index inj so printf bracket inside quotation percent d comma a r r inside the square bracket i and j i will now run this code as you can see the elements of multidimensional array are printed here the outer for loop runs two times from i is equals to 0 to i is equals to 1 and in each iteration of outer loop the inner loop runs 3 times from j is equals to 0 to j is equals to 2. initially the value of i and j is equals to 0 so arr i j prints the first element that is 1. now in the second iteration of the inner loop the value of j is increased to 1 and the array i j becomes 0 01 and it prints the second element 3 on the screen in this way the inner loop runs three times to access all three elements of first array after that the condition of inner loop becomes false so the inner loop dominates now the program control moves back to the outer for loop and the value of i becomes 1 and again the inner loop restarts from j is equals to 0 to j is equals to 2. this time ar ij becomes arr100 arr11 and arr 1 2 which gives the first second and third element of secondary to help you visualize the output more clearly let me print a new line after the inner loop so print f i'll break the line here i'll run this program and you can see the output is printed in proper format now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze which value will we get when we print arr 1 4 from the following array comment your answer below also if you want to revise this concept you can find all these programs in our github repository and the link is in the video description below so see you in the next video till then happy programming
