print a multiplication table of a number entered by the user from one to ten when i run it it asks me to enter a number and i'll say something like 9 and when i press enter as you can see the multiplication table is printed in this nice format here count is increased from 1 to 10 and we have calculated the product by multiplying number and count so in the first iteration product will be 9 times 1 which is 9 in the second iteration product will be 9 times 2 and so on
