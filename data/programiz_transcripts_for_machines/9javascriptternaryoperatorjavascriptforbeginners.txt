what's up guys i'm punish from programmers and welcome back to the series on javascript in this video we will learn about the ternary operator which can be used to replace if else statements in certain situations to make our code look cleaner so let's get started let's start with the syntax of the ternary operator the ternary expression starts with the test condition like x less than zero or name equals to punit or anything that evaluates to true or false if this test condition is true the expression before the column is executed and if the test condition results in false this expression or the one after the column is executed as you can see from the syntax the ternary operator takes three operands hence the name ternary operator now let's see an example of the ternary operator on my code editor i'll create an age variable and assign a value 15 to it i will now create a ternary condition age greater than equals 18 let me put that inside parenthesis and then i'll put a question mark if the condition is true i want to put or print can vote similarly if the test condition is false i want to print cannot vote let me run this program as you can see cannot vote is printed this is because here the age is 15 which is not greater than equals to 18 that means this boolean expression is false and that is why the part after the column or console log cannot vote is executed and that's why we got cannot vote as an output if you're enjoying this video please also check out programs pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount we saw how to use the ternary operator as per our need we can also return a value from the ternary operator and assign it to a variable then we can use the variable after that let's modify this code i'll create a result variable and i'll assign the value or the return value of the ternary operator to the result variable since i'm assigning the value to a variable let me remove this console log so what will happen is first let me remove this other one now what will happen is if h is greater than equals 18 if this is true then the result variable will be assigned the can vote string otherwise it will be assigned the cannot vote string let me console lock the result and run this code and you can see that i got cannot vote this is because 15 greater than 18 was false so the result value variable the result variable had the value cannot vote and that's what i got printed when i said console.log result you can use either one of these approaches that we used for the ternary operator however if you need the value from the ternary operator to be used for other purposes later in the program you should always store the value in a variable in some cases we can also use the ternary operator to replace the efile statements to make our code a bit cleaner so let's see the comparison between if else and the ternary operator as you can see both the if else and the ternary operator are checking if the value of score is greater than 50 and the code of the ternary operator obviously looks much cleaner and easier to read so simple if else that has a single line of code can be replaced by eternal opera in most cases however if the efile statement has multiple lines of code you should always you go for the ifl statement okay guys we need your support to keep these kinds of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses now to practice what you have learned here's a programming task for you can you create a program to check whether a number is positive or negative to create this program create a variable name number and assign a value to it then using a ternary operator check if the number is positive or negative if the number is positive print the number is positive if the number is negative print the number is negative you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository and if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github i'll put the link in the video description now that we've reached the end of this video it's time for the programming squares what is the correct ternary equivalent of the following if else statement commit answer below happy programming you
