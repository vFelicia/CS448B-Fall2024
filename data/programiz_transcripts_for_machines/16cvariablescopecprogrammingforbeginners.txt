hey guys this is me padma from programmers and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we'll learn about variable scope more specifically we'll learn about local and global variable scope in c programming so let's get started in programming a scope is a particular reason in a program and a variable scope determines which variable can be accessed from which region of a program in c programming there are two basic types of variable scopes they are local variable scope and global variable scope let's start with the local scope first to understand the local scope let's see an example of a c function in my code editor you can see function add numbers this function takes two parameters and it stores the sum in the result variable and it prints the result inside the function instead of printing the result inside the add number function let's print it after the function call so i'll paste it here so i have moved this line from the add number function to this main function i will run this code you can see we get an error saying result on declared this is saying the result is appeared for the first time in the line 11. you might be wondering how is that possible even though we have declared the result variable here inside the function well this is where the concept of local variables comes in any variable that is declared inside the function is a local to it meaning the result variable is local to the add number function this reason is called localscope and the result variable has no existence outside this group when the function ends the local variable are destroyed this is why we get an error when we try to use the result variable outside the local scope now if you remember we can solve this problem by returning result from the add number function so i'll add return result and i'll change this void to end since the function now returns a value i will now assign this function to a variable sum and then i'll print the sum so i'll run this code you can see the result is equals to 11 which is 5 plus 6. with the return statement we are not using the local variables directly rather we are returning its value to the function call and assigning it to another variable inside the main function this concept of local variable is a good thing because anyone using this add number function does not need to know what's inside it they just need to know what argument to pass and what value it returns and they can use this function without a problem this makes our code reusable to not only us but also to our fellow programmers by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description another way we can solve our earlier program is using global variables global variables are variables that are declared outside of the function let me show you so i'll use this code from earlier as you already know this code will generate an error so now what i will do is i'll declare an invariable result outside the add number function and then i'll remove this in from here now i'll run this code as you can see this code runs without any error so what happened here is the result variable is declared in global scope this is why we are able to access it from both the function this add number function and the main function that's it for this video if you want to revise this concept you can find all this program in our github repository the link is in the video description below now that we are at the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze in the volume code which variable is a global variable comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming you
