hey guys this is me padma from programmies and welcome back to this series and c programming in our past videos we learn about function now we will learn to create a different type of function that call itself these are called recursive function it's going to be an interesting video so let's get started in computer programming recursion is a process that allows us to create a function that call itself let me show you what does that mean on your screen you can see we have created a function named recurse and you can also see we are calling the recurse function from inside its body here the function is calling itself this is called a recursive function let me tell you how this works initially the recurse function is called from the main function now the control of the program goes inside the body of the recurse function inside the function body we have included the function call to call the same recurse function now again the programs control move back to the recurse in this way the function is called again and again this might result in infinite function execution to prevent this infinite recursive call we need to provide an if else statement let me show you you can see we have put the recursive call inside if else statement now the function call itself only under certain condition this way we can prevent the infinite recursive call by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured free programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description now that we know how recursion works let's see an example i'll create a program that computes the sum of n natural numbers instead of typing the program line by line i'll just copy the program so that i can focus more on the actual working in our previous video function we have already discussed about this function prototype so if you want to know more on this you can find the link in the video description as well here we have some function that takes in parameter n here n represents the number up to which we have to find the sum for example if n is 4 we have to find the sum of four numbers 1 2 3 and 4. inside the sum function we have an if else statement that checks if n is equals to zero if false the function makes a recursive call to itself however for each recursive call we are decreasing the value of n and finally when the value of n becomes 0 the else condition returns n and the recursive call is stopped let's run this code and i'll enter 4. you can see we get the sum is equals to 10. let's see how it works so initially we provide 4 as input value which is stored inside the number variable this value is passed to the sum function during the function call from the main function inside the sum function the value of n is now 4 so the condition is not equal to 0. so this condition becomes true and if statement is executed here the return statement inside if returns n which is 4 plus a recursive call to sum which with a new value 3 which is 4 minus 1. now again the value of n is 3 which is not equals to 0 so this condition is true again so the if statement is executed now if statement returns 3 and a function call with a new value 2. this process continues until the value of n becomes 0 when n becomes 0 the else statement is executed which returns 0. finally we have returned value 4 plus 3 plus 2 plus 1 plus 0 hence we get 10 as output also this image will help you visualize the working more clearly okay guys we need a support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the videos so leave a comment below press that like button hit subscribe if you haven't already let's keep the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses now to revise what we have learned in this video here is the programming tags for you create a program that computes the factorial of a number here take a input number from the user create a function that takes the number as a parameter inside the function check if the number is greater than zero if true return number multiplied by a recursive call to the function with parameter one less than number else return one you can find the answer to this question in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all the program in this video are present in there the link is in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze which of the following statement is false comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming you
