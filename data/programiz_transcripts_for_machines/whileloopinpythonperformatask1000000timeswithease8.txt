what's up guys i'm puneet from programmers and welcome back to this series on python in the last video we learned about the if statement to create programs that can make decisions in this video we will learn about the while loop a loop is a fundamental concept in all programming languages not just python they are used to repeat a block of code multiple times as per our requirement this allows us to create some interesting programs as you'll see in this video so let's get started before we write the actual code of the while loop let's take a look at its syntax a while loop starts with the keyword while followed by a test condition followed by a colon then we write the body of the loop in the next lines notice the spaces before the body of the loop this indentation is important as it indicates the body of the loop here's how this pseudo code works python checks this condition which is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false if it's true the body of the while loop is executed at this point it's similar to the if statement however unlike an if statement that checks the test condition only once after executing the body of the loop it checks the test condition again this process goes on and on until the test condition evaluates to false if the test condition is never false the loop runs forever until the system's memory runs out let me give you an example so i'll remove this old code and i'll say count equals 0 then i'll say while count less than 5 print i am inside a loop let me add one more statement and say print looping is interesting let me run this program and as you can see these two print statements are executed again and again and again let's analyze what this program is doing here count equals 0 in this line count less than 5 or 0 less than 5 is true that is why these two statements are executed now since this is the while loop it will again check the test condition again count or which is 0 less than 5 is true and again these statements are executed this happens again and again and this condition count less than 5 is never false so the loop runs forever this is known as an infinite loop however most of the time rather than running a loop forever and ever we want loops to end at some point let's say we want this loop to run only five times we can do that by adding one statement inside this loop so that this test condition count less than five is false after running five times at the end of the loop i'll add one statement count equals count plus one here we have increased the count variable by one in each iteration of the loop now let's see from the start how the program works initially the count variable is zero that's why count less than five or zero less than five is true and the body of the while loop is executed if you've noticed this new line that we have added is incrementing the value of count by one since its initial value was zero its new value is one now the while loop checks the condition again this time count less than 5 or 1 less than 5 is again true and again the body of the loop is executed but this time since the value of count was 1 its new value is 2. basically this line count equals count plus 1 is increasing the value of count in each iteration of the loop from count equals 0 to count equals 4 which is five times after the five runs the count variable is increased from four to five only then the test condition count less than five or five less than five is false let me press the run button and show you so when i press the run button this time i am inside a loop and looping is interesting is printed only five times let me change this program a bit i will remove these two print statements and instead i'll print the count variable inside the for loop so that we can better understand what's happening now when i press the run button as you can see the value of count was 0 and it went up to 1 2 3 4 and 5 and when count was 5 it was this condition was false and the loop exited now let me modify this program again i will change count to 5 and i'll change this test condition to count less than equal to 10. can you guess the output of this program without running it i'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video you can find the answer to this program in our github repository the link will be in the video description before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below now let's try one more example of the while loop we will print the multiplication table of a number that is entered by the user from 1 to 10. to write this program we need to create a loop that runs 10 times from 1 to 10. let's do that first so i'll remove this old code and i'll say number equals int and then i'll take an input enter a number then i'll say count equals 1 while count less than equals 10 count equals count plus one let me run this code and it says enter a number when i enter six nothing really gets printed this is because i have not printed anything inside the while loop however this program is still doing something useful it is taking the variable count and increasing it from 1 to 10 in each iteration of the while loop because of the statement count equals count plus 1. now in each iteration of the loop we need to print the row of the multiplication table i will do that by adding a few lines so here i'll say product equals number times count and then i'll say print product we have computed the product by multiplying number by count and in line 6 we have printed the product by using the print statement let me run this program when i run it then it says enter a number and when i enter something like 6 we can see that the output shows the result when 6 is multiplied by numbers from 1 to 10 let's make that a bit more readable here instead of print product i'll say print number times count equals product let me press the run button and it says enter a number i'll enter something like 6 and when i press enter then it shows the multiplication table in nicely formatted manner this is because as we have seen in the previous video the print function takes whatever is in between the commas and prints them with spaces in between as you can see from this example you can write pretty awesome programs using loops the syntax of the while loop is pretty easy however the important part is the logic and how you use it and how do you get good at logic one word practice so here's a task for you to practice can you modify our multiplication table program so that you get a multiplication table from 10 to 1 instead of 1 to 10. you have to modify the same program that i've written here and you can see the expected output on the screen find the answer to this question in our github repository also visit our website programmers.com for more information on why loop with examples i posted the links in the description below by the way if we know that our loop iterates for a certain number of times like 5 times or 10 times in our examples it's easier and better to use the for loop which we will learn about in the next video before we wrap up this video let's recap some of the concepts we have learned loops are used in programming to repeat a block of code the while loop runs continuously until the test condition is false if the test condition of the loop is never false the loop runs infinitely until the memory is full this is known as an infinite loop that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i posted the links in the description below feel free to copy the programs and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below in the next video we will learn about the python for loop which is used to iterate through a sequence join me in this video series and let's explore the exciting wall of programming together if you like this video hit the like button now and also don't forget to subscribe to our channel and
