hey guys welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we will learn to work with files in c programming more specifically we will learn to perform file operations like read content from the file write content to the file this is going to be an interesting video so let's get started in c programming there are usually three steps involved while working with files open a file perform file operation close the file let's first learn to open a file we use the file pointer to work with the file don't worry you don't have to understand all about this pointer just remember this syntax for now now once we create a file pointer we then use the f open function to open the file let me show you an example here i have this test.txt file now let's open this file what i'll do is i'll first create the file pointer file pointer so file astrix fptr now i'll use f open function fptr is equals to f open parenthesis inside quotation test dot txt and another attribute that is r that means read basically opening a file is nothing but connecting our c program to the external file in this case we are connecting our main dot c file to this test.txt file now you can see this r this r here indicates that we are opening the file in read mode so we can only perform the read operation on the file one thing you need to remember is that while opening the file in read mode you need to make sure the file is already present in the specified location otherwise the f open function will return null let me show you now let me first complete this program so i'll add here include stdio.h and int main inside curly braces return zero and i'll cut this two lines of code and i'll paste it there so let's make it more clearer okay so now i'll add an if else statement to check if file open is successful or not so here i'll add if fbti is not equals to null then we'll print file open successful file oh then successful else will print file open unsuccessful and success now let's run this code as you can see file open is successful because test.txt file is present here now let me change the file to something else let's say test2.txt and i'll save this and i'll run this again as you can see this time we get file open unsuccessful because the file does not exist and f open returns null by the way do you want to take your programming journey to the next level watching tutorials is fine but it has one limitation it's hard to learn and practice together at the same time lucky for you we have recently launched programming's pro that provides tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscriber we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount now that we know how to open a file in read mode let's read its content in c we use the afkit function to read the content from the file let me show you an example here you can see the code from our earlier program now i'll change this test to to test.txt now i'll remove this file open successful print statement from if condition now let's use afkit's function to read the content of this file so first we need to create an array to store the file content so i'll add here care content square bracket 1000 now let's read the content from this file to this array so i'll write here f gets bracket content comma 1000 comma fbtr and i'll close this then i'll print it using printf statement so percent f comma content i'll save this here f kids read the content of the file and stores it in the content area and this thousand is the size of the file that is to be read since our array is thousand i have kept a thousand and fbtr is the pointer used to read the file now let's run this code you can see we get the output this is the text file here you can see in this file this is the text file is the first sentence we are only able to get the first sentence from the file because here we have used f kits and f gates can only read the first sentence at a time if we need to read all the lines we can use a loop let me show you so first i'll use this line as the condition of while loop so i'll write here while and put this line inside parenthesis here as get's function reads the content of the file if the file read is successful it returns true otherwise it returns false hence our loop runs until there is some content to be read from the file now inside the loop i'll print the file content so i'll cut this and put it here now i'll save this now let's run this code as you can see we are able to read all the content of the file once a read operation is completed it is a good practice to close the file we use the fclose function to close the file here i'll add fclose function at the end fptr now let's learn to write content to a file but first we need to open our file in write mode this means we need to use w as the second parameter instead of r with the f open function let me show you here this test.txt file already exist but if the file did not exist a new file is created let me show you i'll change this name to new file new file dot txt now this new file will be created i'll save this and i'll run this you can see new file.txt file is now created here now let's add content to this file we use f put function to write content to a file let me show you i'll write here f puts parenthesis inside quotation i'll write i love c programming comma fbtr let me add one more message here i'll add f puts inside parenthesis i'll write c programming series by programmies is the best so here comma fbtr and don't forget to close the file so f close fptr now let's run this code now when you open this file you can see the file now includes the message however the message looks a bit odd so in this file i'll add here backslash n and i'll save this and let's run this again now you can see the file looks clean now here remember that initially the file did not exist when we run the program for the first time a new file is created we then added the content to the file using f puts and when we run the program for the second time adding backslash n the initial content of the file is erased and new content is added so whenever we open a file in write mode if the file already exists all content will be erased let me show you that again now i'll change this message from i love c programming to to new misses new message 1 and i'll change this to new message 2 and i'll save this and i'll run this now you can see the old content is now replaced by new content now to revise what you have learned in this program here is a programming task for you create a new file in write mode and add content c is a font programming language and i love using c language close the file again open the file in read mode and read the content of the file you will find the answers to this question in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all these programs will be there as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming you
