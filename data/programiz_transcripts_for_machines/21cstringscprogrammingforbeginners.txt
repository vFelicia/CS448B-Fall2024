what's up guys welcome back to this series in c programming in this video we will be learning about strings in c more specifically we will be learning to use textual data in our code so let's get started before we learn more about strings let's first see the example of the hello world program here hello world is an example of a string we have used double quotation to represent strings in programming strings are a collection of characters that are used to represent textual data for example hello world is a string containing a sequence of characters h e l l o w o r l d world now that you know what strings are let's see how we can create them in c here we have created a string type variable str with the value program is if you look carefully you can see the syntax of string looks somehow similar to an array this is because the string in c are an array of characters so this code is similar to this so let's complete this program has include stdio.h int main inside the curly braces return zero i'll cut this and i'll put it here then i'll print this using printf statement so percent s comma str here you can see we have used percent as format specified to print the string now let me run this code you can see we have successfully printed the string by the way every string in c is terminated by a null character represented by slash 0. this null character helps the compiler to identify the end of the string even in our string programming the compiler adds slash 0 at the end due to this the actual size of the string will be 1 greater than the total number of character in the string by the way if you're watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description we can use the same scanner function to take string input from the user let me show you here i have this code from earlier program i'll remove this part now if you remember this is the syntax of declaring an array i'm declaring an array of characters so i have to provide the size of this array as well i'll add here 20. now i'll add scanf statement to take the input from the user you can see i have used str instead of ampersand str this is because sdr is an array and it already points to the address of the first element of stm hence we can omit ampersand and we will discuss this in our later videos now before the scanf let me print the statement and ask the user for their name so printf i'll enter your name here now i'll run this and i'll enter my name you can see input value is stored on str string now let me run this code again this time i'll enter my full name padma manandar and i'll enter however i'm only getting pogma instead of my full name padma manandar this is because the scanf method only takes the input until it encounters white space here there is a space after pogma so the scanf method only takes padma and ignores manandar if you want to take the entire line of string as input we can use f gates function let me modify the program i'll remove this scanf function and i'll add here f gets bracket str comma size size of str comma std i n here f gates function only takes three parameters the first parameter represents the name of the string in our case str is the name of the string and the second parameter is size of the string and this third parameter is stdin which means standard input which denotes that we are taking input from the keyword now let me run this program i'll again type my full name and i'll enter this time you can see my full name is printed okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses we know that a string is a area of characters in c so just like an array we can access each character of a string using indexes let's see an example i'll start with the basic structure of c program so hash include s t d i o dot int mean and inside this curly braces return zero and here i'll create string with value programming so so care str square bracket is equals to programming now to access the characters we can use string name and the index inside the square bracket so let's access the first character and print it using print statement so i'll use print statement print f percent c comma str and index is zero and i'll run this code you can see p is printed on the screen similarly we can access other elements easily using array indices for that i'll copy this so i'll copy this and paste it here and i'll just change the value of index number here from 0 to 1 2 and 3 so now second third and fourth elements can be accessed using array indices one two and three so now let's run this code as you can see we get the desired characters we can also change the character of a string for this we can simply assign a new character to a particular index let's see an example i'll use the same code from earlier program here i'll remove these print statements now suppose i want to change this third character to capital o i can simply assign value to index 2 so str square bracket will point to the index number 2 and will assign its value capital o now let's change this fifth character to capital r so i'll do the same process here again so str with the index number four that means the fifth element is equals to capital r i'll now print the string using printf statements so print f bracket percent s comma str and i'll run this program as you can see the third character it changed to capital o from small o and the fifth character it changed from small r to capital r to revise what we have learned so far here is a programming tags for you create a program that takes your full name as input and prints your name then change the first letter of your name to x now if your name is joan williams it will be x on williams if your name is julie bing it will be julie being with x as your first character you can find the answer to this problem in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all the programs in this video will be present in there the link is in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming
