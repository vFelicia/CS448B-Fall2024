first and foremost thank you for showering all the love on our ass programming's part one as i mentioned before during the part one video there were so many questions that we had to break up the video into two parts and this is part two of ask programmers also i'd like to thank all of you for taking us 10 000 subscribers it's a massive number for us and it really motivates us to create more content so if you have not hit that subscribe button hit it and also hit that bell icon so that you get notifications for the next video the first question is from youtube comments so it says i love your python tutorials waiting for other languages to what is your favorite programming language bro the question is from asmitastraster so you must be wondering it must be python but it's not i actually love javascript because uh not because you know there's a preference then i believe that javascript is better than python but because it is the programming language i learned first when i went into professional software development and it's a language that i've always talked with in fact we we are planning some tutorials on javascript or you know we have a series on javascript on the programming website and you could see apps or videos on javascript coming soon so definitely javascript is uh what my favorite programming language and it's a language that i will never give up on uh one is by karthik udainiya udainiya so he says ask program is when will you start making videos on application based or project based coding like for programming games i i understand that you want to start building projects and you know just learning and this is something that i've been saying myself that watching tutorial after tutorial is not going to help unless you get your hands dirty with programming so definitely that is in the pipeline and you know first we want to wrap up the basics of python so that when we build those projectbased things if you get stuck then you have high quality resources you can get back to if you go to project based videos directly then you know if you don't have good resources on the basics we don't want you to get stuck and that's why we want to finish all these basics videos first definitely as you mentioned we want to teach you how to build projects and how things work in real life some of them are very different from the tutorials or you know it's not as rosy as the tutorials seem to be but yes that is definitely in the pipeline the next question is by a user called civo hd so they say will you teach machine learning on python now this is a question that we get a lot and you know this is something that we ponder a lot that should we go into more advanced courses like machine learning and data science and web development and all that but what we've decided is program is is always going to be for beginners and at least that is the focus right now so we are not going into teaching machine learning or you know more advanced parts of programming this helps us really focus our attention on beginners who are struggling with basic concepts and this is a conscious decision that we have taken as a brand so maybe in the future yes but for now we are focused on helping beginners uh take their first steps into coding moving on to the next question so it's from youtube riya stressed asks which text editor do you guys use ask program is my favorite is vs code and everyone in our team uses vs code because not only is it very simple it's also open source and it's got this whole ecosystem of extensions and community behind it so whether if you're doing if you're coding in python you can install the extensive for python if you're doing web development there are lots of extensions for web development if you're doing data science then there are lots of extension for data science and so it is so customizable and still so simple i don't know how you know how it's it's kind of i used to always believe that uh microsoft visual studio was one of the best pieces of software ever built and i'm so glad that they've open sourced it and made it made it lighter and made it open for the whole world to use so yes vs code is definitely our first choice of text editor and not just us it's you know all over the world vs code has taken the world by strong and the community that that keeps on adding to it is amazing so i suggest if you're a beginner or even if you're someone intermediate or advanced uh try vs code it's amazing the next question says i am working in an mnc so multinational company they do provide education and courses i joined the programming world and started from there in one of those courses i found your course on python beginner and started and followed your program his website i learned the basics sir and due to being i learned the basic sir and due to being a fulltime employee unable to manage the time i am expecting a few exercises in python for beginners now it's a great thing that you want exercises and you know something beyond the tutorials and the little assignments that we give at at the end of some of the tutorials and if you're a beginner then our website has a dedicated section for examples in fact there's a dedicated header menu that says examples and you can look at the examples in different programming languages however i understand that you know many of these examples can be uh like build a fibonacci series or something that does not relate to a real problem but more of a simulation of a mathematical puzzle so that is something that we are definitely looking to change and we are going into more live projects so sir my question is about data structures and algorithms i heard this concept and don't know what this is and what do we learn in this concept and where to start this is a great question by kushal shah so thank you for asking it first yes for beginners you know there's there's so many buzz words that appear on the internet and on even in our content that can be confusing especially data structures and algorithms for someone learning if else and for loops and struggling with these concepts suddenly someone comes you and says learn data structures and algorithms you know go for competitive programming and it can be overwhelming so data structures and algorithms are more of an intermediate or advanced concept in programming basically if if it is about optimizing your code so that it runs faster and does not consume a lot of resources so data structures and algorithms basically trains your mind to pick the right structure for your data or you know how you can structure your data and algorithms basically focuses on finding more efficient solutions for instance if you wanted to find the sum of the first 10 numbers then you could say you know you could run a for loop from 1 to 10 and then you can add all those numbers up but if someone told you to add the first billion numbers to the first trillion numbers then this algorithm of running a for loop from 1 to a billion or a trillion probably will give you trouble instead there's a mathematical formula n times n plus 1 by 2 that will directly give you the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n so this is an algorithm that will you know that is more efficient and algorithms basically is about building these kinds of efficiencies into your program i hope this made it clear but again data structures and algorithms takes time to learn the next question comes from shreem mishra he says hello respected teachers can you please help us in writing python codes to print patterns it's a bit confusing and also do introduce us with your team and tell us more about your python passion and your work is just i don't see a lot of you guys have been asking us this question that you want to see pattern programs now i understand you know this uh the fun of pattern programming i did it myself when i was in college and uh it can really help you get your head around the basics of code because there's a challenge and you need to solve it so definitely we're coming up with those kinds of videos and also challenges in our app stay tuned now another thing that you asked is uh introduced to our team definitely uh there's you know it's not just me there are people who help me write the script there are people behind this camera who helped me create these videos there are people who design our website there are people who write content so there's this huge team of people that make programs possible obviously and i'm the person that that is in front and that because i am in the videos everybody knows me but uh definitely i would love to introduce some of the team members and maybe we will plan something around that so thank you for asking this question shout out to everyone in the programs team i love you guys and you do such wonderful work i am so proud of this team now about my passion for python um i don't really have a passion for python or javascript i you know and i feel that you as a beginner you should not build or even as someone advanced you should not really build an attachment for one programming language instead have a passion for for problem solving or for one domain of programming so you could say i have a passion for machine learning or i have a passion for web development i have a passion for building enterprise software or mobile apps that is a better way because you know see let's talk about mobile apps when i was uh starting my career people were building mobile apps in java and you know objective c then swift came along and changed the way we built iphone apps now there's uh then react native came so javascript was the way to go now people are building apps in flutter so the programming language will always change and you know if you get stuck if if i was stuck with objective c till now i would probably be out of job so don't really get attached to one programming language something better than python or javascript might come coming tomorrow and you know take the world by storm it doesn't take too long so yeah don't be passionate about programming languages instead try to find the niche that really attracts you and and then do research on which programming languages are popular in that field that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed it i enjoyed it a lot because it's always great to see that people have questions and people expect so much out of us it's also a bit of pressure but that's okay i enjoyed this whole process of making videos and creating content i and the programmers team are thankful for all these questions and all the motivation to build new products definitely all your suggestions are being uh taken and we are building lots of products for you stay tuned and i'll see you in the next one you
