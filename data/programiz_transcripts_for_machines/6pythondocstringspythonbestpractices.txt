python docs strings provide a convenient way of associating documentation with python modules functions classes and methods in this video we will learn to create docs strings and understand how and why they are used so let's get started dog strings are basically multiline comments inside functions methods modules classes and so on so before we dig deeper into doctrines let's revise multiline comments first as we know we can either use triple single quotes or triple double quotes to create multiline comments let me give you an example so in my code editor i'll say quotation mark quotation mark quotation marks takes two parameters returns sum now let me end the comment by saying triple quotation mark again and then i can say def add numbers a b this will return the sum of a and b now i can say print add underscore numbers 5 comma 10 now i'll save this go to my terminal and say python main dot pi you can see that the expected output was returned here these lines are comments as they are inside triple quotation marks these lines are ignored by the python interpreter now we are ready to learn about docstrings i have this code from our last example on my screen let me modify this program a bit and put this comment inside the function definition now this comment code inside the function is a dog string for a multiline comment to be a dog string it must be the first line of a function class module and so on now if i hover over the function call i can see the documentation on how to use this function this can be really helpful if you are working in a team and have to use other people's code if we want we can also print the docs string from our program using the doc attribute let me show you how so below this code i'll say print add underscore numbers dot underscore underscore doc underscore underscore now let me close this bracket save this program open up my terminal and i'll say python main dot pi something is wrong it does not have okay add underscore numbers dot there's an extra underscore here let me save let me run this program again and you can see that whatever i had typed inside this is printed here here this underscore underscore dock underscore underscore or dunder dock is a special attribute that prints the dock string if the docsing is not available it prints none you can use the dock attribute to also print the docs string on inbuilt functions modules and so on let me give you an example so let me first clear this terminal i'll remove this old code and then here let me hide the terminal and here i'll say import math and then i can say print math dot underscore underscore doc i'll just go underscore similarly i can say print math dot sqrt dot underscore underscore doc underscore underscore and let me save this open up my terminal and say python main dot pi and you can see that this model is always available it provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the c standard which means this is the dock for math module and similarly sqrtx returns the square root of x which is the documentation for the square root function of the math module if your code editor supports it you can see doc strings by hovering over modules so let me hover over math and hovering over functions and methods like this by the way if you find this video useful a sub to the channel would be much appreciated before moving to the next section of the video the programmers team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easier to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description writing docstring is pretty easy however there are a few things we should keep in mind while creating doc strings first a dog string must be the first statement in a module function or class otherwise it's not considered a doc string second we cannot use regular comments that start with the hash to create a doc string even though this comment is a first line inside the function it's not a dog string because it's not a multiline comment and the last thing you need to remember is that dog string must not be descriptive rather they must follow do this return that structure for example just by looking at the source code we know that the add numbers function takes two arguments and returns their sum also it's a good habit of ending the dot string with a full stop that's it for this video if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository i'll also put this link in the video description and if you like this video hit that like button and subscribe to the channel so that you get notified when we release the next video happy programming
