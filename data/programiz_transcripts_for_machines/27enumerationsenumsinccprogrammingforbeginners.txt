hey guys this is me pablo from programmies and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we'll learn about enums in c programming we'll also learn to create variables of enum types and use them in our program so let's get started in c programming an enum is a type that has a fixed set of values let's see an example here we have used the enum keyword to create the enum named size this enum contains four fixed values small medium large and extra large these are called enum constant now let's create enum variables from the above enum so i'll create enum size suit size your suit size is an enum type variable this variable can now store one of the four values present in the enum size so basically the value of suicides can be of either small so i'll assign this here suicides can be small or this can be medium so medium or this can be large or it can be extra large now let's complete this example and run the code but before that let's first quickly learn about integral constant in c all enum constant are internally represented as fixed integer values known as integral constant if we consider our earlier enum the constant small is internally represented as 0 and similarly medium lars and extra layers are represented as 1 2 and 3 respectively let's verify this i'll go back to my code editor here you can see the code from our earlier program now i'll complete this program so i'll add here has include stdio.h and here i'll add int min and inside the curly braces return zero and i'll cut this and i'll put it here so yeah i'll now print this using printf statement and here person d comma su size as we know enum constant are integer values internally so i have used this for person d format specifier now i'll run this as you can see we get three as an output because internally the value of extra large is three now i'll change the value of suicides from extra large to small and and i'll run this again this time we get the output zero by the way do you want to take your programming journey to the next level watching tutorials is fine but it has one limitation it's hard to learn and practice together at the same time lucky for you we recently launched programmies pro that provides tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an experience of how programming works in the real world sign up now visit the link which is also available in the video description below as we saw in our earlier example the default integral values of enum constant starts from 0 so we get value 0 1 2 and 3 for enum constant small medium large and extra large however sometimes it might be necessary to print other values for example the value 0 1 2 and 3 for sizes small medium large and extra large does not make sense instead we might want to print 27 for small 31 for medium 35 for lars and 40 for extra extra lars in such situation we can change the value of integral constant let me show you how i'll go back to my code editor here you can see the code from our earlier example now i'll assign new value to this enum constant so small is equals to 27 and medium is equals to 31 lars is equals to 35 and extra large is equals to 40. now let's create some more variables as well first i'll cut this line of code and now i'll modify this and write here suicides 1 is equals to small and similarly i'll write enum size so size 2 is equals to medium and for large and extra layers i'll copy this too and i'll paste it here and i'll change this to size 3 and i'll write here large end so size 4 is extra large so extra large then i'll print this for that i'll use the same code from our earlier program and i'll copy this and i'll paste it three more times i'll change this from suicides to size 3 and this is so size 4. now let me run this code as you can see we get 27 31 35 and 40 for the enum constant small medium large and extra large now we are to at the end of this video but before ending the video let me give you a small tip we have been using this format to create enum variable however we can also create enum variables while defining the enum let me show you here suicides is an enum variable and like before it can only store four values now let me run this code now this time we get the expected output okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the videos so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses now to revise what you have learned in this program here is a programming task for you create an enum with enum constant sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday inside the main function create two enum variables named weekend one and weekend two assign values sunday saturday to the variables respectively print the values of the week in one and weekend two you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all this program will be there as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze what is the name of the variable in the following enum comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming you
