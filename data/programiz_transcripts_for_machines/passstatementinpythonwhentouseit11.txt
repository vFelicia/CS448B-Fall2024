what's up guys i'm puneet from programmers and welcome back to this series on python in this video we will learn about the pass statement it's going to be one of the shortest video in this series so without any delay let's get started suppose you need to create a loop or a decision making statement however we are not sure yet what its body will be in such scenarios we can use the pass statement let me give you an example so i'll say number equals 5.5 and then i'll say if number greater than 0.0 and then i'll add pass statement here when i run this program my code will run without any errors now i can write code after the if statement and run it and implement the statement when it's necessary before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below what would happen if we used comments instead of the pass statement in the above program let's find out so i'll see so i'll remove this pass and i'll say to do will figure out later now this time if i press run then python gives me an error it says unexpected uf while parsing this error is basically saying you cannot end the program file like this something is wrong we are getting this error because the body of the if statement is empty and comments don't count because python completely ignores comments so whenever you need to create loops if else statement functions and classes with an empty body you can temporarily use the pass statement before i end this video let me recap the concept that we learned in python pass is a null statement that does nothing the path statement can be used to create loops effects statement functions and classes with an empty body you will learn about classes and functions in the next few videos that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i have provided the link in the description below feel free to copy the programs and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below join me in this video series and let's explore the exciting world of programming together in the next video we will learn about functions in python which is a core concept in all programming languages not just python if you like this video hit the like button now and also don't forget to subscribe to our channel and ring that bell icon so that you don't miss the next video thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one happy programming
