what's up guys i'm punished from programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about arrays which allows us to store a list of values in javascript so let's get started in javascript we use an array to store multiple values together let's imagine a scenario where we want to store the names of hundred people if you start storing each name in a single variable we would have to create hundred different variables in such cases we can use an array to store 100 values at once here names is an array that is storing all the names of 100 people all these names enclosed inside the square bracket are called elements of the array to be an array the elements should be enclosed inside the square braces parenthesis will not do now that we know the benefits of using an array let's see an example i will go back to my code editor and create an array called routine so i can say const routine equals as i mentioned we use square brackets for arrays so let me store two strings each and the elements are separated by a comma and sleep here eat and sleep are called the elements of the array routine now let me print the array so i'll say console.log routine and press run you can see that i get eat and sleep i get the array back as i had created it now let's see one more example this time i'll create an array of numbers just to show you that array also works with numbers so i'll say const numbers equals 2 3 5 and 7 all prime numbers and console log numbers let me press run and you can see that i got an array of numbers here's where it gets interesting we can also create an array with elements of different types in javascript let me show you i'll create an array and store values of different types so i'll remove this old code and say const arr equals let me start with eat and another string sleep and now i can put in a number another number and maybe another string and when i console log this arr variable and press run i get the output properly if you're enjoying this video please also check out program is pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount so far we've been printing complete array elements at once now let's see how we can access each element of the array to access an array element we need something called an array index an array index is a unique number associated with each array element suppose we have an array like this so i'll remove this old code and let me create an array called my array equals h e l l and o oops not the variable o the string o all right now an array index starts from zero that's why the index of the first element h is zero the second element is one and so on now we can use this index number to access the corresponding character let's access each character one by one so i'll go back to my code editor and i'll write to access the first character console.log my array and inside square brackets 0. here i have used the array name followed by square brackets and inside this the index of the element which i want to access so let me press run and you can see that i get h which is the first element in this array now to get the third character i can write instead of 0 2 and when i press run you can see that i got l which is the third element in this array in this way you can access other elements using the corresponding index number we can also find the length of an array using the length property the length of an array is the number of elements present inside the array let me give you an example i'll take my array which i already have and console log my array dot length now when i press run you can see that i got 5 which is the number of elements in the array containing the characters hello once an array is defined we can also add other elements to the array to add an element to an array we use the push method let me show you how let me go back to my old array of routine so routine is eat and sleep which is not healthy at all now i want to add the element exercise i can use the push method as routine dot push and exercise after this if i do console.log routine and now when i press run you can see that the routine variable or the routine array now also has exercise at the end of it okay guys we need your support to keep these kinds of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses we can also change the elements of an array for this use the index number of the element and use the equals to operator let me show you how so i will go back to my routine array with just eat and sleep and now suppose i want to change the value of sleep to exercise then i can use the array index as routine now inside the square bracket since this is the second element and array indexing starts from zero so zero and one so routine one equals exercise and if i now console log routine you must have guessed the output by now when i press run i get eat and exercise that means sleep has been replaced by exercise we can also remove any element from the array to remove an element from an array we use the pop method let me give you an example on my code editor let me create an array with four elements so work eat sleep and obviously our favorite exercise now let me use the pop method on the array so i say routine dot pop and now when i console log routine again and press run you can see that exercise is no longer there pop remove the last element from the routine array by the way there's also another way to create an array and that is by using javascript's new keyword it is created like this so i can create something like const routine equals new array and just like a function it starts with parenthesis and inside i can put the elements that i want to be in this array so i can say eat comma sleep and now let me console log routine and when i press run it shows that i've got an array with eat and sleep as its elements so i showed you this so that you don't get confused if you see this kind of syntax somewhere else now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you create an array named greet with values hello and high now find the length of this array add a new element welcome to this array and find the length of the new array you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can always find these programs in our guitar repository as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we've reached the end of this video it's time for the programming quiz what is the output of this program comment answer below and i'll see you in the next video happy programming you
