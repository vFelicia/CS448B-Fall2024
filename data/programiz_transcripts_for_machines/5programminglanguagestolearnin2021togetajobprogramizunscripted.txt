so in this video we are going to talk about the top five programming languages to learn to get a job in 2021. now i've talked about this before and i usually suggest that don't go after programming languages but then there's also this decision of you know why would you start learning a deadend language or which is not gaining popularity when there's a choice to learn another so it's a difficult question but i can only give you the information that you need to make that decision and here i am with that so the number five programming language to learn in 2021 is csharp csharp was developed by microsoft and it is used for enterprise software development cloud services and game development as well it is very versatile and used but pretty much everywhere where software is built now one metric that helps us choose which programming language is better or popular is the number of job postings on job websites so if you look at indeed then there were 26 000 job openings for csharp developers in january 2020 and in the same month there were 19 000 openings for csharp developers on simply hired that's a staggering 9.3 of all software job openings on indeed that's a huge number if you look at the curve of the percentage of job postings that are taken by csharp developers in different job websites then you will see that the curve has remained stable and it is going to remain stable for the next few years as well the reason why csharp is so popular is because it's stable it's built by microsoft the decisions related to you know the big things about where the programming language is going are done by a single company of course there are other contributors as well but this makes c very stable there are not five frameworks to do the same thing or there are no seven libraries that pretty much do the same thing so there's this coherence of effort and that is why a lot of uh you know there's very much clarity for example if you want to build games in c there's unity if you want to build enterprise softwares there's dotnet so there's a lot of clarity around what needs to be used to build something using c sharp and that's probably one of the reasons why it is considered one of the most stable programming languages out there and it is very popular the next language in the list is c plus c plus plus is an extension of the c programming language with support for objectoriented programming and also support for a lot of control over hardware it is very easy to learn and it is still very popular in fact if you look at the openings on january 2020 on indeed there were more than 35 000 job openings for c plus plus developers on simply had this number was above 23 000. according to class store the average salary of a c plus developer is 60 thousand dollars and according to indeed this number is closer to ninety one thousand dollars ten point seven percentage of all job postings on indeed related to software development where for c plus developers in 2019 and just like c sharp this curve has remained stable for the last five years so c plus plus still is out there now one of the biggest reasons for c plus plus popularity is because you know you can interact with a lot of hardware using it it is very popular with games it is very popular in a lot of uh you know applications that require low level control over memory for instance browsers most of the browsers that you use are made in c plus plus a lot of code that needs to be really performant needs to be written in c plus in fact even so many enterprise applications are written in c plus plus the next language on the list is javascript javascript was initially used for web development on the browser but now it is also used for server side apps and also for mobile app development so it is growing in its use if you look at the number of job postings on glassdoor in january 2020 there were 46 000 openings for javascript developers there similarly this number was 51 000 plus for indeed and almost 38 000 for simply hired according to glassdoor a javascript developer makes almost eighty thousand dollars a year and according to indeed that number is closer to hundred thousand dollars so if you look at the numbers 14.5 of all software jobs on indeed way for javascript developers now javascript is popular because of its versatility it was already being used in web development before now with node.js it can also be used to write serverside apps with electron you can also build desktop apps and with technologies like ionic phonegap and react native you can also start building mobile apps using javascript now if you look at the percentage of job postings for javascript in the last five years then you will see that this also has remains stable there is a lot of demand for javascript now this is where i will go a bit away from the curve because uh these curves can be you know these are for uh openings in the us now if you um from my personal experience uh in the developing world javascript is gaining a lot of popularity and i feel that it is one of the programming languages that is growing the fastest today the next language on the list is java java is an objectoriented programming language that has been around for decades it is used for everything from enterprise software development to building largescale web applications let's look at the number of active job openings for java developers in january 2020. on glassdoor this number was close to 60 000. on indeed this number was 61 000 and on simplified this number was over 40 000. now glassdoor says a typical java developer makes almost 80 000 a year in the us similarly this number is more than 107 000 if you ask indeed almost 21 of all job openings on indeed in 2019 for java developers and this curve of the percentage popularity of java in terms of the number of developers that are required has remained stable for the last five years now the reason why java is so popular is because it is platform independent you any application you write in java can be deployed on linux server on windows server or any other server and this is one of the reasons why big companies especially they like to invest on java they have always done this and they are going to continue to invest in this programming language another reason why java is popular is because of its maturity it's been around for such a long time that the popular frameworks libraries and the ecosystem around java has gotten a lot of in feedback and improvements over time so it is a time tested programming language that has a good ecosystem and that is considered to be reliable by the world's biggest companies now moving on to the last programming language or the number one programming language to learn in 2021 you must have guessed it by now it's python python is an interpreted and easy to learn and use programming language that finds use in in almost every field of web development machine learning data science you name it it is also one of the most popular programming language for teaching programming in colleges in the us it is also catching up everywhere else in the world as the first programming language that someone learns if you look at the number of active job openings for python developers on different hiring platforms this number was more than 71 000 on indeed and glassdoor similarly simply had had more than 51 000 job openings for python developers in january of 2020. according to glassdoor the average salary of a python developer in the us is more than 76 000 and this number is approximately 98 000 if you ask india 18 of all job openings on indeed in 2019 were for python developers uh now from 2019 to 2021 i am sure that this number must have increased a lot now why python is so popular uh i'm getting tired of answering this question python is so easy to learn well written python code looks a lot like human readable language and it is very versatile so something that's easy and also versatile and finds its use in so many different fields like machine learning data science web development you name it obviously a lot of programmers are going to be attracted to it and that is the reason why python has become so popular now uh i hope this video did not confuse you because you know all these five programming languages they have i showed you the curves for the demand in terms of job openings in the last five years and they are all very stable it goes on to show that all these five programming languages are very safe in terms of choosing them for your career because they have a lot of demand and consistent demand and there are a lot of open job openings for these programming languages so if you want to be on the safe side then yes it is always better to choose these popular programming languages however also keep an eye on you know domain specific programming languages like rust and go that are really rising they might be in the list pretty much soon all the programming languages i talked about today have a lot of community support great documentation amazing tutorials on the internet and also a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks they are very stable and the job openings for these programming languages have remained stable or grown in the last five years and that is why we have included them in this list so if you're choosing any one of these programming languages you can rest assured that there is a job waiting for you but you still need to focus on the basics you need to make your effort to make sure that if you need to learn a new programming language you should not feel that you are starting from scratch focus on the basics focus on the concepts and i'll see you in the next one you
