hey guys this is me padma from programmies and welcome back to this series nc programming in this video we'll learn about the switch statement and how to use it to make decision making programs in c programming here we will also create a calculator using switch statement so let's get started before we learn about switch statement let's consider a scenario we are given a number between 1 to 7 and based on the number we have to print the day of a week for example if the number is 1 then the day is sunday and if the number is 2 then the day is monday and so on now we can use the ifall statement for this however for every number there should be a separate condition this will make our program look messy and difficult to understand for such type of problems where we have to choose from multiple options a better approach will be switch statement let's start with the syntax of the switch statement first the switch statement starts with the switch keyword followed by the variable or expression inside the parenthesis inside the switch statement we can create multiple cases and each cases will have its own value now the value of variable or expression is compared with the value of individual cases if the result of the variable or expression is equals to value 1 then the body of case 1 is executed similarly if the result is value 2 then the body of case 2 is executed and so on however if the result does not match any case then the body of default is executed now let's get back to our original problem of finding the days of the week on the screen you can see the basic c program now i'll create a variable number int number then i'll ask the user to enter number between one to seven so i'll use printf statement and i'll print the message like enter the number between 1 to 7 and store the value to the number variable so scanf site quotation percent d comma ampersand name of the variable that is number then i'll create the switch statement that will print the day of the week as we have already discussed we'll use switch keyword and then inside parentheses we'll put variable or expression in this case we have variable number so i'll put number here then a curly braces inside this curly braces will add cases so when the case is won i'll print sunday and i'll use break statement after that i'll talk about this break statement later on the video so let's continue when the case is 2 i'll print monday so monday and break statement so what i will do is i'll copy this and paste this five more times and at the end i'll put default and i'll print invalid number invalid number so invalid number now the case 1 and case 2 is already done so i'll edit from case 3 and case 3 is tuesday similarly case 4 is wednesday and case 5 is thursday so we'll write thursday here then case 6 is friday and finally case 7 is saturday so let's make this as capital so here i have included cases from case 1 to k7 and if the user input 1 then this part of code is executed and sunday will be printed on the screen and if the user input 2 then this part of code will be executed and monday will be printed on the screen however if the user input any number except 1 to 7 then the code inside default will be executed and invalid number is printed on the screen now let me run this program i'll enter five now the input value five matched this case case number five and thursday is printed on the screen now let me run this code again this time i'll enter six as expected we get friday as output now once again i'll run this code and this time i'll enter the number that does not lies between one to seven so i'll enter 9 and as you can see i got the output invalid number which is present inside the default here the default case is optional we can remove this if we are sure that the input value matches one of the cases go ahead and remove the default value and try the code here if you have noticed i have used break statement inside individual cases here this break statement exit the switch statement once the matching case is executed if we don't use the break statement all the cases after the matching case will be executed now let me show you i'll remove this break statement from the program so let's remove this now i have removed the break statement from each cases now i'll run this code and i'll enter 5 and it matches the case number 5 and thursday is printed at first then all the cases after that is also executed so we get the output thursday friday saturday invalid number this is why it is important to use break after every cases by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description we learned that using break after every case is important however sometime there might be situations where we want to execute multiple cases together in such situation we can omit break statement let's see an example as you can see i have pasted some new code on the compiler here we want to check if the day is weekday or a weekend so all the cases from 2 to 6 will print weekday and the case 1 and k7 will print weekend and then the default will be a invalid number now let me run this code i'll enter fourier as expected we get weekday and i'll run this again this time i'll enter one and you can see weekend is printed on the screen as you can see we can omit the break statement as per our need next we will use the switch case statement to create a simple calculator okay guys we need your support to keep this type of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses now that we know the working of the switch statement let's create a simple calculator using it here i have copy pasted the code from our github repository so that you don't have to see me typing the whole thing now let's see what's happening in this code here we have created a character variable we then ask the user to choose an operator and store the input in the operator variable then we ask the user to provide two input values and store them in num1 and nom to variable then the result variable will store the value after calculation you can see we have used operator variable inside the switch statement and each case statement uses an operator as its value and based on this operator the corresponding operation is performed inside the case now let me run this code here i'll enter plus and i'll enter first number 8 and then second number 12 you can see i get 20 as output what happens here is i provide plus as operator and this plus operator matches with this case hence the addition operation inside the case is executed and the final result is 8 plus 12 that is 20. the break statement then terminates the switch statement now let me run this code again this time i'll enter asterisk and the first number nine and the second number five since i entered asterix the operator match with this case so the multiplication is performed between number nine and five so we get 45 as our output in this way we can also perform subtraction and division you can try it yourself now to revise what we have learned here is the programming tax for you use the switch statement to create a program that will find the month based on the number input here take the input from 1 to 12 and print the corresponding month based on the input value if the number is 1 print january if number is do print february and number is 3 then print marge and so on you can find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise today's learning all the programs will be present inside the repository the link is in the video description now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze which of the cases is executed in the following code comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming
