hey guys i'm padma from programmies and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we will learn about the boolean expression in c programming more specifically we will learn about the boolean type logical and comparator operator that are used to create decision making programs so let's get started just like integer and double boolean is a data type that can store only two values either true or false we use the bull keyword to create boolean type variables however to create a boolean type variable we must import the std bool header file first let's see an example here i have a basic c program now i'll first include include stdol.h just like stdio.h now let's create two boolean variables bull value 1 equals true and another bull value bowl value 2 equals false now we'll print these variables we know that we use format specifiers to print variables in c however there is no format specifier for bold type variable so how do you print a boolean variable well we use the percent d just like printing integer values this is because in c programming boolean values are represented by integer data false is represented by 0 and true is represented by 1 or all the values except 0. now let's print these variables now i'll print this using printf statement using percent d format specifier value 1 and i'll put some space here then i'll print another value 2 using printf statement so here we'll use percent d format specifier and value 2 and we'll we'll put some space here and i'll run this you can see 1 is printed for true and 0 is printed for false one thing you should remember is that c is a case sensitive language and we cannot use true and false with capital t and capital f let me show you i'll replace this small t with capital t and i'll replace this small f with capital f and i'll run this as you can see i get an error this is because true with small t is different from true with capital t by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description now that we know about the booleans let's learn about comparison and logical operators these operators are used to create boolean expressions that return boolean values let's start with comparison operator i'll first copy a list of all comparison operators in our text editor so that it's easier for us to use them now let's go through them one by one i'll start with greater than operator the greater than operator checks if the value is greater than another value let's see an example here i am using greater than operator to check if 12 is greater than 9 and assign the result to the value variable since 12 is greater than 9 the output will be true so let's run this code as you can see i get 1 as output which represents true now let's change the value of 12 to 5. now i'll run this code again this time we get output 0 which represents false it's because 5 is not greater than 9 so the greater than operator results false similarly the less than operator checks if the value is less than another value here i'll simply change the greater than sign to less than sign the value 5 is less than 9 so the output will be true let's run this code as expected we get the output 1 which is true now let me change the value 5 to 9 and i'll run this code again here i'll get 0 as output because 9 is not less than 9. the equal to operator compares two values and return true if the value are equal i'll use the same code and change the less than sign to equal to sign here 9 is equal to 9 so we should get true as output let's run this code as expected we get one as output now let me change this nine to six by just looking at this you can tell the output is going to be false let me run this code as expected we get 0 which means false in c programming similarly there is not equal to operator it does exactly the opposite of what equal to operator does it checks if two values are not equal here i'll change this equal to operator to not equal to here we are using not equal to operator between nine and six now let's run this code i get one as output because nine is not equal to six so result is true in c programming there are also some compound comparator operators like greater than equal to this operator gives true if a value is either greater than or equal to another value i'll use the same code and i'll change this value to 9 is greater than and equals to 6. now what do you think the output of this code will be i'll run this and yes you guessed it right the output is 1 because 9 is greater than 6 so the result is true similarly there is less than or equal to operator that does the exact opposite of greater than or equal to let's change the operator here now let's change the operator here i will run this code you can see i get 0 because 9 is neither less than or equal to 6. we can also use this comparator operator with floating point number so i'll change the value 9 to point three four and change this six to six point eight seven now we are checking if nine point three four is less than or equal to six point eight seven i'll run this code as you can see i get the output 0 that means the condition is false till now we have used comparison operators to compare two values however we can also use them to compare variables let's see an example i'll create two variables int num 1 equals 9 and another variable int num 2 equals six now let's compare these two variables to compare that we'll create bull value bool value equals num1 is greater than num2 here i'm checking num1 is greater than norm2 now let's print this using print statement print f bracket inside quotation percent d comma value now i'll run this code we get output 1 because the value of num1 equals to 9 is greater than value of num2 that is equals to 6. we can also use comparison operators with variables and value i'll remove this num2 and i'll remove this num2 here as well and put here value 6 and i'll run this again as you can see code runs perfectly fine and we get the output as before these are the comparison operators that are used in c programming they all return a boolean value and the expression where they are used is called boolean expressions in our previous example the code num1 greater than 6 is a boolean expression boolean expression check particular condition and results either true or false and based on the result we can perform different actions okay guys we need your support to

engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses now let's move to logical operators logical operators are used with boolean expression to perform logical operations c programming has three logical operators and they are and or and not let's copy them in our code editor and learn them one by one we use the two ampersand sign for the and operator let me show you an example i'll create two variables a's and height with value 18 and 6.3 so let's do that int is equals 18 and double height equals 6.3 now i'll create another variable bull result where i'll assign two boolean expression first to check if a is greater than or equal to 18 so equals to is is greater than or equals to 18 and second to check if height is greater than 6 so height is greater than six and now i'll use and operator to join them so let me complete this program here i'll add print statement print printf bracket inside quotation percent d comma result here i have used n between two boolean expressions the operator returns true if both expression are true let me run this code here i get 1 as output because a is equals to 18 so this boolean expression returns true and height is also greater than 6 so this boolean expression returns true as well hence we get the final result that is also true now let me change the value of 18 to 16 so this expression is greater than equals to 18 becomes false now let me run this code as you can see we get output 0. this is because the and operator returns true only if both the expression are true however the value of a's is 16 so this expression is false hence we get the final result zero that is false in c programming now let's learn about logical r operator we use double pipe symbol as the r operator the r operator returns true if one of the boolean expression is true let me show you here i'll replace this and with r here this expression is false however this expression is true so the result will be true let me run this code as expected we get one as output unlike and and or the not operator is used with only one boolean expression we use the exclamation mark as the not operator the not operator simply reverse the result of boolean expression if the expression is true it returns false and if the expression is false it returns true let's see an example i'll use the same code as before here i'll remove this double variable and this expression height is greater than 6 and i'll use not operator before this expression here this expression is false so the not operator reverses the value hence the final results become true let me run this code as expected we get one as output now let's change the greater than operator to less than or equal to operator here the boolean expression is true so the result will be false because of this not operator now let me run this code as you can see we get 0 as output boolean expression are very useful in decision making and loops they are used to check particular condition and based on the condition we can make some decision suppose you want to check if a person is eligible to vote then we can use boolean expression to check if the a's of the person is greater than 18 and depending upon the result of the boolean expression we can decide if the person can vote or not this is how we can create decision making programs using boolean expression in the next video we'll learn to create decision making programs so don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss that now that we are at the end of this video it's time for programming
