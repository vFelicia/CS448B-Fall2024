congratulations on getting this far i hope you had a great experience learning python with me to celebrate your milestone i have a little surprise for you but you'll have to wait till the end of this video to find out what it is now that you're at the end of the python series let's talk a little bit about a programming fact the theory of programming looks easy but the practical bit is very very super super hard you must have noticed this while following my youtube tutorials as well you thought you had grasped the concept but when you tried to do it on your own you struggled and you got frustrated this is why i specifically wanted to make this video so that i could guide you to the next step in your programming journey at programmers we realized that the videos we have on youtube and the tutorials we have on the website are great for learning concepts but from the feedback and suggestions we were getting on youtube and on the website itself we realized that it was still hard to learn things practically we realized that there's a need or a gap for a platform where you can make mistakes you can learn you can try quizzes you can give challenges and you can learn more interactively in real time while getting feedback and that's exactly why we've created programming's pro a platform that combines knowledge with practice and with practice you also get and the ability to track your progress in real time so that you can know where you are and how much you need to learn to apply for your first job once you register to program is pro you'll have access to all the courses that i personally spent hours and hours creating these courses contain not just lessons but also programming challenges and quizzes so that you can constantly test your knowledge these challenges will force you to go through the process of finding and fixing errors so that you get the real life experience of a developer this is where our learning paths come in they start with the very basics of the programming languages that are used in this field and then they slowly guide you through quizzes and challenges and top of the class content so that you can land your first internship or job with confidence our learning paths are designed to be very focused so that they only cover the essentials of any field without overwhelming you since we're talking about internships and jobs let me share a little nugget whenever i'm interviewing people i always make sure to ask if they're done in projects or not those projects could be simple but imagine me having to choose between someone who has never done any real life projects versus someone who has it becomes really a nobrainer for me to select the person who has done some project so we understand that if you want to apply for an internship or a job the interview will most likely ask for a project and our learning paths also contain project based learning where you'll be asked or guided through the process of creating a real world project that you can use as your portfolio you'll be uploading these projects to your personal github so that you can demonstrate that you can also collaborate with other people on code this will give you a nice github portfolio so that when you apply you stand out from other candidates thanks for sticking with me till the end as promised i have a little surprise for you i'm giving away 50 discount on programs pro subscriptions for my youtube subscribers so go to programmings.pro i put the link in the description below and use the coupon code program is 50 to get a 50 off on our annual subscriptions i hope to see you at programmers pro till then happy programming you
