hey guys welcome back to this series on c programming in the last few videos we have been learning about pointers in c we'll continue that in this video as well today we will learn to use pointers and function together this is going to be an interesting video so let's get started firstly let's revise the working of the function with the help of an example here i have created a function that calculates the square of a number the function takes single parameter and it then computes the square of the number and then returns the square here we are passing a regular variable to the function in c we can also pass a pointer variable as an argument to a function let's see an example in which i'll create a function that accepts a pointer as an argument and change the value pointed by the pointer so i'll create a function void find value here this function takes pointer as an argument and inside the function asterisk num is equals to 39. here the nonparameter is a pointer variable and we have changed the value pointed by this pointer now let's create a number variable inside the main so i'll create here int number and i'll assign value 21 to this and i'll call the function by passing the address of the number so i'll call the function find value bracket ampersand number since our function accepts a pointer variable which stores the memory address we are passing the address of the number variable now let me print the value of the number so i'll use print statement printf inside quotation number percent d comma number let's run this code as you can see the value of the number is changed to 39. this happens because when we pass the address of a number variable the pointer variable inside the function is assigned with the address of the number so when we change the value at the memory address the value of the number is also changed now let's see another example in this example we'll find the square of a number like before but this time we'll use a pointer variable instead of a regular variable here i have the code from our earlier program let's remove this function now i'll create a find square function void find square and this function accepts a pointer variable as its parameter so int asterix number inside the function i'll find the square of the number so int square is equals to asterisk number multiplied with number this syntax might look confusing for you here asterix number is the value pointed by the number pointer and we are multiplying the value with itself now the square variable stores the square of the number now let me assign this to the value pointed by the number pointer so asterix number is equals to square now inside the main function i'll change this find value to find square so find square i'll also modify this print statement i'll write here square is now i'll run this code as you can see we have computed the square of the number by the way do you want to take your programming journey to the next level watching tutorials is fine but it has one limitation it's hard to learn and practice together at the same time lucky for you we recently launched programmies pro that provides tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an experience of how programming works in the real world sign up now visit this link which is also available in the video description below just like regular variable we can also return a pointer variable from a function let me show you an example here we have our code from our earlier program now suppose i want to return pointer from the function not just compute the square so first i'll change the return type of the function from void to integer pointer that is int asterisk now inside the function i'll add a return statement that returns a pointer so return number this statement returns the address pointed by number now to store the return value i'll assign this function call to a variable so int asterisk result is equals to this function call since the return value is an address we have created a pointer to store the result now let's use this result variable to print the square value i'll modify this print statement here i'll remove this square is and i'll write here result is percent d and i'll remove this number and i'll write here asterix result now let's run this program as you can see the return address stores the square of the number okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's keep the engagement score higher so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses let's see one more example to make it more clear for you so i'll create a function that adds to number and returns the sum let me go back to my code editor i'll remove these all code from here and i'll remove these statements from here so first i'll create a function that accepts three pointer so i'll create a function here that is int asterisk add number int asterisk num1 comma int asterisk num2 comma int asterix sum inside the function we will compute the sum of the number pointed by num1 and num2 and store the result to the address pointed by the sum so we'll do asterix sum is equals to asterisk num1 plus asterisk num tube then i'll return the sum so return sum now inside the main function i'll create two variables int number 1 and i'll assign value 32 and another variable in number 2 and i'll assign value 18 to this and a sum variable to store the sum let me call the function by passing the addresses of three variables so i'll call the function add numbers parenthesis ampersand number 1 comma ampersand number 2 comma ampersand sum since the function returns the address i'll assign this function call to a pointer so int asterisk result is equals to this function finally i'll print this using printf statement so print f bracket inside quotation sum is percent d comma asterisk result now let me run this program as you can see we have computed the sum of two numbers using the function and pointers now to revise what you have learned in this program here is a programming task for you create a program to find the multiplication of two numbers using a function and a pointer here is how your programs would work create a function that assets three pointers inside the function multiply values represented by two pointers and assign the result to the address of the third pointer inside the main function create three variables two variables with the value 13 and nine and third variable to store their product call the function with addresses of the three variables as argument store the return value inside a pointer and print the value pointed by the returned address you will find the answer to this question in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all these programs will be there as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze what type of value does the following function return comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming
