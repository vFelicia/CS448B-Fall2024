what's up guys i'm punit from programmers and welcome back to the series on javascript in the last video we learned about javascript arrays and to make working with rs easier javascript has numerous array methods readily available for us to use in this video we will learn about various array methods that are used to perform different operations on arrays so let's get started the push and unshift methods are used to add elements to an array let's see an example suppose i have an array on my screen so i'll say const fruits equals let me give apple orange and mango now if i want to add another element to the array i can use the push method like this so i can just say fruits dot push and let me add pineapple and now let me verify that the array element has been added by console logging fruits when i press run you can see that pineapple was added to the end of the fruits array but what if you wanted to add the element at the beginning of the array i can use the unshift method for this let me show you how so let me remove this code and instead i'll say fruits dot on shift and instead of pineapple let me add kiwi which is one of my favorite fruits and to verify i'll console log fruits and press run and you can see that instead of in the end this time kiwi was added at the beginning of the array similarly if we want to remove an element from the array we can use the pop and shift methods let's see an example i have the array from our previous example now this time i'll say fruits dot pop and let me see what happened to the fruits array after running pop oops i'll press run and you can see that mango has disappeared from the fruits array the last element is gone because i have popped it if instead you wanted to remove the first element we can use the shift method instead of pop so i'll just remove pop and say fruits dot shift now when i press run instead of mango being removed this time it was the apple that was cut from the fruits area and we only have orange and mango remaining by the way it's fantastic that you're learning javascript if you ever want to broaden your knowledge and explore other programming languages be sure to check out our ever growing list of mobile apps for java python and c they provide well structured courses and certifications which will definitely improve your resume and skills all these courses are free so download now i'll put the link in the video description below we use the concat method to join two or more arrays let's see an example i'll remove the sold core and i'll say const array 1 equals hello world and let me put another array array 2 equals javascript and programming now i can use the concat method to join these two arrays so i'll say const result equals array1 dot concat array2 and let me console log the result to see what happened when i press run you can see that the result variable now contains an array containing all the elements of array1 followed by all the elements of array2 that means the two arrays were concatenated into one array by the concat method the sort method is used to sort elements of an area alphabetically in ascending order let's see an example suppose i have an array of fruits like this so i'll remove the sole code and say fruits equals apple mango papaya and my favorite kiwi now i can use the sort method to sort elements of the array so just say fruits dot sort and as usual we want to see what fruits has when i press run you can see that papaya is now at the end because it starts from p kiwi has moved from the last place to the second place basically this array or the elements in this array are now in alphabetical order the slice method allows us to create a new array from an existing array let me give you an example i'll start with an array so i can say const ir equals hello world javascript and programming four elements now let me create a new array containing the first three items of this array for that i just need to say const new air equals r dot slice now i want to start from the first element so i will write 0 which is the index of the first element i want so i want to start from hello which is the 0th element since array indexing in javascript starts from zero and then comma and then the end index but not inclusive so i want elements up to the third index the fourth element the third index because i want the first three elements so i say three however this second value is not included so programming which is the third element third index element is not included i should get the first three elements with this this is confusing at first but you'll get used to it eventually so i'll say console.log new arr and when i press run i got the first three elements again let me revise i start with the first index and go up to the third index but not including the third index that's why i start from hello and go up to the third index but i don't include it so i start from hello and go till javascript and that's why i got the three elements instead if i wanted just javascript and programming then first of all get the first parameter right so i want to start from javascript which is the second index so two and i want to go till programming or the element after that so 0 1 2 3 4 i want 4 here and when i press run this time i got javascript and programming it might confuse you because the fourth index element doesn't even exist but we have to remember that the slice does not take the last element of this second parameter now there's a little trick to the slice method we can also use a single index instead of the start and end index if you use the single index the slicing starts from the index and goes till the end of the array that means since in this case when i wanted javascript and programming i actually wanted to go to the end of the array i don't need to provide the second parameter if i press run then the slicing will start from javascript and go until the end which includes only programming in this case okay guys we need your support to keep this kind of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagements go high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses we can use the splice method to change the elements of an array let me give you an example so let me remove this code i have an array with four elements hello world javascript and programming now i want to remove the first two elements and add another element instead of it so i want to remove hello and word and let me say arr dot splice so how splice works is first of all i want to start removing hello so that means the zeroth index so i put zero here that means the splicing or the removing of the elements will start from zero now i want to remove hello and world which is two elements so the second parameter will be two and instead of these two elements i want to put language let me say so i want to put the string language so that is what i'll do splice in fact comes from botany so you must have heard of splicing of plants and that's how it works we remove something and put something in its place so i'll say console.log arr and now when i press run you can see that hello and world have been removed because i am starting from the zeroth index removing two elements and language has been added in its place because i have put the third parameter of splice as language which is what do i want to put instead of this we can use the includes method to check if an array contains a specified element let me give you an example suppose i have the array just like before and now let's use the includes method to check if this array contains javascript so i'll say const result equals arr.includes and the string javascript now if i console log the result you must have guessed the output by now but i'll still show you let me press run and you can see as expected i got true because indeed javascript is present in this array now let me change the value to something else let's say python which is obviously not in this array and obviously i'll get false this time we can use the find method to get the array element that satisfies the provided condition let's see an example i'll start with the numbers array so const numbers equals 2 4 7 9 and 12. now i want to get the element that is greater than 5 from this array for that i can use the find method like this so i can say const result equals numbers dot find now here's the tricky part we will need to provide a function with the parameter as the element so i'll say element element greater than 5 this is an array method which we have learnt in the previous video if you don't understand what this is then let me rename this as function element return element greater than 5 this is essentially the same thing so basically put in a function that contains a representation of each element of this array and inside i will put in a true or false value or a true or false boolean expression if you're confused with this don't worry we'll explore this further in the further videos now let me console log the result and press run and you can see that i got 7 which is the first element in this array which satisfies this condition now apart from the ones mentioned in this video the javascript array provides many more methods to perform different operations on arrays if you want to learn about all of them you can visit our website www.programmies.com i'll put the link in the video description below now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you create an array with values i love javascript add the new value programming at the end of this array check if the array contains the text javascript using an if condition and if it does print the text you're doing great keep learning you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise this concept you can find all these programs there i'll put the link to that in the video description below as well now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for the programmers quiz what is output of this program you can see the options on your screen comment the answer below happy programming i'll see you in the next one
