what's up guys i'm punished from programmers and welcome back to this series on python till now we learned about three different sequences lists tuples and strings these are compound data types that allow us to work with multiple items at once in this video we will learn about dictionaries which is also a compound data type however the items in a dictionary and how we access them is a bit different than other sequences like lists and tuples let's see what dictionaries are all about and how we can use them in python a dictionary is a collection of key value pairs it is similar to associative arrays in other programming languages to create a dictionary in python we need to put these key value pairs inside curly braces separated by commas like this this dictionary has two items separated by commas and each item is a key value pair separated by a column for the first item its key is name and its value is linus similarly for the second item its key is age and its value is 21. let me print this dictionary and run it so here i'll say print person 1 and when i press run then the same dictionary is printed there are a couple of things we need to remember when we create dictionaries first keys of a dictionary can be any immutable object like numbers strings and tuples however they cannot be objects that can be modified like lists second the keys must be unique for identification let me change the name key to 10 and this age key to a tuple and run it so here i'll say instead of name i'll say 10 and i'll turn this age into a tuple and now when i press run then as expected this is a valid dictionary this works because both these keys 10 and this tuple age are immutable objects dictionaries are optimized to get values when the key is known if you remember we use numbered indices like 0 1 and 2 to get elements from sequences like lists and tuples in the case of dictionaries these keys are used as indices i have this program from our last example suppose we want to get linus from this dictionary to get this i'll type square brackets after our dictionary name and inside i'll type the name of the key which is name and now when i press run i get linus similarly to get 21 we need to use age as a key so here instead of name if i type age and press run then this time i get 21 now let's see what happens if you try to access a key that's not in the dictionary i'll change this age to hobbies and when i press run then python tells me that there's a key error because hobbies is not present in this dictionary person one sometimes instead of getting this error we may just want to know if the key exists or not and decide what to do based on it in that case we can use the dictionaries get method like this so here i can say person 1 dot get and inside parenthesis i can say hobbies let me run this code this time instead of an error we get none this nonobject means empty or no value this can be useful because i can use this in an if statement and run different codes based on it we can also pass a second argument to the get method if the key doesn't exist this default value is returned instead of none i'll provide a list as a default value so here i can say person1.gethobbies and inside let me pass a list saying dancing and fishing now when i press run now instead of none we get this list back before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below i have this person one dictionary we have been working on in my screen now let's change the name to dennis to do so we need to assign a new value to the key like this so here i'll say person 1 name equals tennis i'll run it and we can see the value of the name key is now dennis if you try to assign a value to a key that doesn't exist yet it will add a new item to the dictionary let me show you so here i'll say person one hobbies equals dancing and fishing i'll press on and as you can see a new key hobbies has been added and its equivalent value dancing and phishing has also been added to this dictionary to remove an item from the dictionary we can use the dictionaries pop method let's see how we can remove this item from the dictionary to remove the item we need to pass the key of the item in the pop method like this so here i'll say person 1 dot pop name now when i press run then you can see that name linus has been removed from the dictionary this pop method also returns the value of the removed item so if i wrap this code inside a print function and press run then i get linus which was the removed item there are many of these dictionary methods readily available for us to use this makes working with dictionaries much easier you can find all the dictionary methods and how they work along with examples in our websiteprogrammers.com i'll include the link in the video description similar to sequences we can easily iterate through items of a dictionary by using a for loop and in each iteration of the loop we get a key of the dictionary let's see that in action i have the same dictionary we've been working with so here i'll say for key in person 1 and here i'll say print key now when i press run then as you can see name and age which are the keys of the dictionary are printed when we know these keys we can easily get the corresponding values as well let me add a line to print values of the dictionary in each iteration of the loop so in the next line i'll say print person 1 key now when i press run then as you can see name linus age 21 is printed which are the keys and the corresponding values in this dictionary starting from python 3.7 the order of items in a dictionary is preserved so when we iterate through a dictionary we get the keys in the order in which they are in the dictionary at this point we have pretty much covered the basics of python dictionaries before we end this video here's a task for you can you guess the output of this program i'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video as always you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository i'll also include this link in the description below here's a recap of what we learnt in this video a dictionary is a compound data type that allows us to work with key value pairs we can easily access a value from a dictionary if its key is known to add or change items from a dictionary we can assign values to the keys we can remove items from a dictionary by using the pop method and finally we learn to iterate through keys of a dictionary using a for loop that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i provided the link in the description below feel free to copy the programs and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below in the next video we will learn about another collection data type sets which is similar to sets in mathematics join me in this video series and let's explore the exciting world of programming together if you like this video hit the like button
