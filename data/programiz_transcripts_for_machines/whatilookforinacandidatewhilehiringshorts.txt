the answer you know to what i look for in a fresher engineer while hiring would be i look for a good attitude i look for good projects beginner projects that are exciting you know if uh so one of the questions that i ask anyone who's interviewing for me is what projects have you done and then tell me the most challenging project you've done so what that gives me is um the answer i i'm looking for is how do they handle challenges how do they handle a situation where you know they're put in a corner and they have to get out of it and usually that's the part where people break or most people break because if you have not done anything challenging if you've just gone through the tutorials if you've just gone through the videos and you know have uh certifications but you did not really put your effort into the end project or your minor project at college or you know all these activities that add depth to your work or depth to the answers when i ask these questions so yeah ask yourself you know what's the most challenging project i've done and and how did i overcome the challenges and if you have good answer to that then you're hired
