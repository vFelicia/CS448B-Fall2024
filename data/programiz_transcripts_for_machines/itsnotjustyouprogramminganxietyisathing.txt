many of you might have come across youtube videos that teach you how to build an instagram clone or a twitter bot in just a matter of minutes or hours now while these youtube tutorials are impressive for a beginner i know that you must be feeling you know when you watch these videos you might feel overwhelmed and you might feel that i have such a long journey to go and you know will i make it so first of all uh always remember that these feelings are completely natural and expected it's completely natural to feel overwhelmed by these because you know a lot can be happening in these videos it's important not to give in to the fear and confusion don't let these feelings creep in because they will stop you from getting your goals so always remember that your goal of becoming a professional software programmer is always within your grasp these youtube rock stars you know they were beginners and rookies just like you someday they were strangers to the world of computer programming until they decided to dive right in and spend time learning the craft now learning anything and mastering any skill requires lots of effort and dedication and you know these people who you see and look up to have spent years and years improving their programming skills and building projects and to basically to get to where they are right now so uh it's important not to get lost and you know focus on too many things what i suggest is you pick up one programming language it can be python or it can be javascript then you know use that programming language to master the very basics of programming learn the very basics and you can then start to tinker with the more advanced concepts fortunately there's a lot of free content available out there for programming uh even on programmings.com you can find lots of programming tutorials on different programming languages we also have a youtube channel where we teach python and we're coming up with more tutorial videos as well but you know you have to decide what's the learning style for you so some people prefer text some people like to read books some people like blogs and some people like me prefer watching videos but still like to have a book on the side for a quick reference so find your learning style and stick to it so that you don't spend too much time going from one you know video to another blog to another website so try to in the beginning at least in the beginning days try to find a learning style and stick to it now once you master the basics i suggest that you start building little projects and apps by yourself what this will do is this will teach you the art of debugging that is finding you know issues and bugs with your code and it will also you will start writing codes that are bit longer than what you would learn right in a typical university course or you know through a regular python tutorial so it will give you that hint of confidence that yes i can you know write code that is longer and that is more complicated than what i have been learning it's also important that you upload all these projects to github and ask your peers for feedback because when people give you feedback you find more bugs that you probably did not find before and also you know someone might tell you a better way to do something a better algorithm to do something that you have done in your code this is also could be the beginning of your portfolio that will prepare you for a professional career so when you apply for jobs then if you have a github profile with where you have built small projects then you have a better chance of getting you know a better job now once your portfolio of a few projects and you know few apps then you have reached a level of proficiency where you can look at an app like twitter or linkedin and you know start to visualize how those apps might have been made now at this point it's time to learn about how to build software collaboratively it's time to learn about the software development process so coding and software development process aren't the same thing coding is basically you write code and software development processes how do you build software using you know large number of people and working in a team so that's a different process and you you should start reading books and learning about that process now let me circle back to the original question of uh you know are these instagram clone videos any useful and my answer is absolutely yes because these videos give you an insight into the thought process and the you know overall wiring that goes inside making a complete app which you might not learn from just tutorial videos we are planning to come up with such videos as well we are still in the brainstorming phase for that but stay tuned we'll come up with those videos now what is already in the pipeline is a qna session so a lot of you have been asking us on youtube in the comments that you want us to answer your questions so now you can do that go to twitter facebook linkedin or youtube and ask a question with the ask program is hashtag and i will surely answer your questions stay curious and i'll see you in the next one
