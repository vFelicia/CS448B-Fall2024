what's up guys i'm punishment programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about the ways to loop over a list of items and also how to loop over an object we will talk about the for off loop and the for in loop so let's get started the for off loop was introduced in the es6 version of javascript it allows us to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays strings sets etc let's first look at the syntax of the far off loop the for off loop starts with a four and a parenthesis inside the parenthesis iterable is the iterable or array or string or whatever you want to iterate through an element is a variable that will store the current item that we are dealing with in those iterable for example suppose we have an array of numbers so i'll create an array say const numbers equals 1 3 five and seven now in a for off loop the iterable will be numbers and element i can keep it as element but i'll need to add a const here because element has not been declared before now in each iteration of the faroff loop element will contain the current item so it will start from 1 and 3 and 5 and so on let's see this in action so i'll remove this and let me print the current value of element to verify that at it indeed contains the item 1 3 5 and 7. so let me press run and you can see that element did contain one in the first iteration three in the second iteration and so on let's see one more example to drive home this point suppose we have an array that contains the names of family members and we want to access those names however while accessing those names we also want to add the surnames to each of those names in this case we can use the for off loop to access each of the names and inside the loop we can join the surname and print the final name let's see a working example let me remove this old code first and let's create an array of names so i can say const members equals john sarah and jack now i'll create a for off loop to iterate over those names so i'll say for const name of members and you can see that this almost reads like english now so inside the loop i'll add the surname smith to each of those names and print the full name i'll also need to add a space between the first name and the last name so i'll say let full name equals name which will contain john sarah and jack respectively and plus and a space and this last name which is smith and let me console log full name to just make sure that this works as intended now when i press run you can see that i was able to add smith to each of these names respectively we can also use the for off loop with strings with strings the for off loop will iterate over each character of the string so let's see an example i'll create a string first let me get rid of this old code let me create a string called name equals program is and now let's see what happens when i use the for off loop on it so let i of name and let's see when i console log i what happens you can see that the value of i was p in the first iteration r in the second iteration o in the third iteration and so on that means the for off loop when used with a string gives me each character one by one if you're enjoying this video please also check out programs pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning

up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount the foreign loop is used to iterate through the element of an object before we learn about far in let's first revise the concept of an object in javascript we use objects to store multiple data together for example if you want to store information about a student you can use an object like this so i'll go back to my code editor and say const student equals and you can see i've used curly braces and inside here i can say name colon monica grade 7 and age 12. data is stored in an object in key value pairs here name grade and age are the keys and monica 7 and 12 are the corresponding values let me quickly print this object and show you the output so i'll say console.log student and press run and you can see that i got the object as output now that we know about objects again let's start with the syntax of the for in loop the for in loop starts with the four keyword followed by parenthesis inside the parenthesis object represents the javascript object that we want to iterate through or we want to get the keys off and key represents each key of the object one by one let's see an example here we have an object from our earlier code now i'll use the for in loop to iterate over the elements of this object so instead of object i will have student and let me do const because key has not been declared before now in each iteration of the loop the variable key will specify the key of the student object so the first iteration the key will be named for the second it will be grade and for the third it will be age let's verify that i'll say console log key and when i press run you can see that i got name grade and age which were the three keys here now that we've successfully accessed all the keys of the object we can also get the individual values let me modify this code i'll first access each value using the key and then print key and value using the template string so let me remove this and say const value equals student key and i can say console.log for template string i'll use backtick and then dollar key because i want to print the key variable and let me print a fancy sign like this and let me say dollar value inside curly braces now when i press run you must have guessed the output by now i get the keys and the values respectively now the student key is the magic here because key contains name so student name becomes monica in the first iteration similarly in the second iteration key contains grade so student grade becomes 7 and in the last iteration because key is age so student and inside the square brackets we have age so student age gives me 12. okay guys we need your support to keep these kinds of content free for all users youtube really likes

courses we can also change the values of an object using the for in loop let me give you a quick example suppose we have an object of employees that contains the name of employees as keys and their corresponding salaries as values now let's assume that the employees are doing a great job and the employer wants to provide a bonus of 5000 to each of these employees in this case we can use the for in loop to access the salary of each employee add the bonus to it and print it let's do exactly that so i'll start a for in loop like before like this employee and now let me get the salary first so let salary equals employee i the same pattern we had used last time and let me add 5000 to it now let me test my code so i'll say console.log let me again use template literals like before so dollar i will contain the name similarly the salary will be stored in the salary variable the new one and this should do it here i will represent each of the names which will be jack paul and monica which are the keys of this object and employee i will give me the values which are twenty four thousand thirty four thousand and fifty five thousand in each iteration i will i am adding five thousand to the salary and then printing the new salary let me run this code and see what happens you can see that 24 000 become 29 000 and so on now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you create an array named names with values jack rosie and mira now use a for off loop to print each name of the array however while printing the name change the first character to uppercase to change the first character to uppercase let me give you a little hint so you can use the carat method with zero as a parameter to get the first character and you can convert it to uppercase using two uppercase method now you can use the slice method of the array to get the rest of the characters except the first character so you can use something like slice one and then you can join the rest of the characters to the first character to get the new name and then obviously you can print it using console.log you'll find the correct answer to this question in a github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs there as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for the programming quiz what is the output of the program you can see the options on the screen comment answer below and if you want to revise this lesson you can find all the programs in our github repository as well i'll put the link in the video description below happy programming and i'll see you in the next one you
