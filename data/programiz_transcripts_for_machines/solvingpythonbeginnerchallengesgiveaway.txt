you know what they say practice makes perfect you can't learn to code just by knowing what it is you need to practice practice practice to get the bigger picture of how programming really works the more you practice the more mistakes you make so you dissect and tear through your code to understand what's going on and then modify it accordingly to correct your mistakes that is how you learn to program quickly and effectively for beginners solving challenges help to build programming logic and programming is all about how you apply logic to solve a problem so today we are going to do some challenges i'll go through easy medium and hard challenges and explain how to solve them fortunately for us program is just added challenges to its python app the app is free for learning the basic scores however challenges are part of our pro model luckily for you we are giving away five programming pro subscriptions every day so stay till the end of the video to find out how now let's get back to our challenges so i'll open my program is pro i already have a subscription and let me choose the first easy challenge so here i will say odd even check so check if an integer is even given an integer input in variable my variable check if it is an even integer if it is an even integer print the boolean value true otherwise print false looks pretty easy so let me go to the compiler all right so to check if it is divisible by 2 let's see so i can just do if my underscore variable oops variable modulus where's the modulus percentage sign here modulus 2 equals equals 0 then it is divisible by 2 so i print true otherwise i print false so pretty easy let me run this and looks like my test cases have passed so i don't want to submit this for now because i'm just testing it out let me go back and now let me do a medium challenge um so let's see let me try catching an exception this sounds interesting so try to divide a number by zero and catch the exception thrown get an integer input and store it in n using try x a block print the quotient when n is divided by zero cast the exception in the accept block and print division not possible all right so division not possible here let me print first n by 0 so n divided by 0 and i want to go into the exception so oops i forgot what the challenge was let's see okay i can scroll so i can go back and here and say division not possible okay so n divided by 0 and it says division not possible let me do this and run and let's see what happens looks like all my test cases have passed because the expected output is the same as my output all right now let's go to the harder one so i'll escape and i'll go to the harder challenges so let me try let me try nested list so append one list to another create two list list one list tool list three and assign one two three four and five six append list two at the end of list one using append and print list one all right so i'll go to the compiler and this is pretty easy for me comparatively so list one dot append and i can say list two and let me see if this works so when i press run then all my test cases have passed and i have also done a hard problem now let's get to the part where i tell you how you can get a one year subscription for programming pro for free to win participate in our program is python challenge it's a five days challenge every day we will post one challenge on all our social media channels facebook instagram twitter and youtube the next day we will announce five winners alongside the new challenge for the day so basically a 24 hour deadline for each challenge to be eligible you'll have to do three things like this video subscribe to our channel if you haven't already and follow us on our social media channels the links are in the description finally you need to post the solution on the challenge post itself on any of our platforms with the hashtag programming's challenge don't forget the hashtag there's no limit to how many submissions you can make to improve your chances you can post the solution on multiple social media accounts that's it that's all you guys need to know and the challenge starts right now here's the first problem description for you you can find this challenge on our youtube community and on our social media you can see the instructions in the description below that's it for this video i'll see you in the next one
