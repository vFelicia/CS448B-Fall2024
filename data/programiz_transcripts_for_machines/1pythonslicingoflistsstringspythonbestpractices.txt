starting today we are creating a new series of python videos where you will learn about python's best practices and write clean readable pythonic code in this video we will learn about slicing of lists which allows you to build new list from an existing list so let's get started before we learn about slicing of a list let's revise list indexing first as we know a list is a sequence of items in an order so let me create a list first here on my text editor i'll say numbers equals let me create a list 5 10 15 20 and 25 to access an individual item from a list we use index and it starts from zero let's access a few items from this list so here i'll say print numbers let me get the first element and let me also get print numbers let me get the fourth element by using the third index let me run this code and we get the expected result python also supports negative indexing for lists using a negative index gives us items from the last so minus 1 gives us the last item minus 2 gives us the second last item and so on so here let me add one more line i'll say print numbers minus 1 let me try one more so i will say print numbers minus 3 and when i press run then 25 and 15 appear because 25 is the last element in the list and 15 is the third element of the list from the last and by coincidence it is also from the first but in this case we are using from the last slicing allows us to create a new list from an existing list let me give you an example suppose we have a list like this so numbers oops equals 5 10 15 20 and 25 let me create a new list containing the first three items of this list to create this list so i can say new underscore numbers to create this list i'll say numbers square bracket now i want to start from the first element so i say 0 colon now i want to go up to the third element that means i'll use 3 this is because the number 0 index 0 is inclusive and the index 3 which is the fourth element is exclusive that's why i only get elements of index 0 1 and 2 which are the first three elements of this list so let me print new underscore numbers and i'll press run and you can see that the first three elements of the list were printed now let's create a list with the third and the fourth item so here i'll start with two or index two which is the third element then because i want to go up to the third index which is the fourth element so here i'll do four and when i press run then i get the third element and the fourth element we can also use negative indexes in slicing notation let me give you an example quickly so here i'll say new underscore numbers equals numbers minus 4 colon minus 1 this should give us items at index 4 which is the fourth element from the last so 1 2 3 4 so including 10 and up to the last element which is 25 but not including it because the end index is exclusive so i should get 10 15 and 20 let's see i'll press run and as expected i get 10 15 and 20. now let me clean up this code and go back to where i was with numbers 0 3 three now let's see what happens if i remove this zero i'll press run and i got the same result as before or as when i put zero and press run similarly if i remove the last index so if i say 0 and if i remove this and press run then i get all the elements if i do 1 then i get elements from the first index to the end when writing python code you will find yourself doing this a lot that is skipping either the first index or the last index because usually you'll want to start from the beginning or go till the end by the way if you're finding this video useful a sub to the channel would be much appreciated before moving to the next section of the video the programmers team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easier to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description up to this point we have only used the start and end index in our slicing the complete slicing notation looks like this it has the start index the end index and step step determines the interval in which we want to get a new list if you skip it we get a list at an interval of 1 like in our previous examples for instance these two codes are equivalent let's try a few more examples of slicing with the step interval so in my code editor let me remove this old code and here i'll say numbers equals 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma 8. so i have 8 and a list with 8 items and here i can say print numbers 1 colon 6 column 2. here this code means create a new list starting from the second item go up to the fifth sixth item or item of index six which is the seventh item but don't include that obviously and with a step size of two let me run this code as expected this code prints a list with second fourth and sixth item let me change the step to three and run this code again so here i'll say 3 and press run now we get a list with the first element 2 and the next element is the third element after 2 so 2 and i skip 2 elements and the third element because the step is three after that the slicing stops because the end index is reached there's a cool way to reverse the list using the slicing notation let me show you how let me remove all this old code since we want to reverse a list i will go through the list from start to end by using empty start and end index so i'll say print numbers and bracket and if i leave both the start and end index empty i can run this code and check so i go through the entire list but now i'll add the third parameter so basically start is empty end is empty and the step becomes 1 now when i press run then i get the list in reverse order because the reverse or the step is minus one we can also use the slicing notation to change multiple items of a list at once to demonstrate this i'll go to my code editor i'll remove this whole code and here i'll say numbers so start with 0 which is default so first three elements are minus 1 minus 2 and minus 3 and let me print numbers again to see what is the change value of the list when i press run then you can see that the first three elements which i got through slicing have been changed by the way the slicing also works for other compound data types that use indexes such as strings and tuples i highly suggest you to try slicing of strings and tuples on your own and let me know if it worked in the comment section that's it for this video if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository i'll also put this link in the video description and if you like this video hit that like button and subscribe to the channel and i'll see you in the next one happy programming
