you probably heard python is an object oriented programming language numerous times at this point this means python supports user defined classes and objects one thing that is particularly interesting about python is that you can not only create custom objects but every preexisting thing available in python is already an object whether it's strings numbers functions or even classes in this video we will learn to check the type of objects find the attributes and methods and have a solid understanding of python objects which will help you become a better python programmer so let's get started as i mentioned already everything in python is an object and we can check this using the type function let's try it out i'll go to my code editor and i'll say numbers equals 1 comma 4 comma 9 comma 16 and let me say print type numbers let me run this code in the output we see class list this means the numbers list is an object that is instantiated from the list class let's try a few more examples so let me create a number i'll say n1 equals 5 and let's print the type i'll also try a few other data types so i'll say flag equals true print type flag let me also try a function so i'll say def my underscore function and i'll create an empty function now let me say print type my underscore function now when i press run we can see that all these entities are instantiated from a class which means they are all objects we can list out all the attributes and methods of a given object by using the dir function let's try it out let me remove this code first and i'll say numbers underscore list equals 1 comma 2. in the next line i'll say print dir numbers underscore list now when i press run this means that our list can access all these attributes and methods let's use the underscore underscore add underscore underscore method that's the first element of this list it is used to append all the items of another list to the end of the current list so i can say let me first comment this out then i'll say result equals numbers underscore list dot underscore underscore add underscore underscore and then let me add another list three comma four now let me print the result and see what we get when i press run then i get a list that has one and two and elements of the other list appended at the end by the way we can also accomplish this task by using the plus operator like this i'll first comment out this code and then i'll say result equals numbers underscore list plus three comma four when i press run then i get the same output as before in fact the plus operator internally calls this same underscore underscore add underscore underscore method when working with lists that's why we can use the operator like this as you can see even though we are working with operators we are actually using attributes and methods of the object internally let me uncomment this code and run it again if you look at the attribute of lists we can see append clear copy count and many other methods that we've been using from before so if you're unsure about what attributes and methods an object can use the dir method can be useful and if you're finding this video useful a sub to the channel will be magnificent the id function in python every object has an id for identity the id of an object is always unique and constant for this object during its lifetime you can check the id of an object by using the id function let's try it out so in my code editor i'll remove this old code and i'll say number 1 equals 5 print id of number 1 and let me create another number so i'll say number 2 equals 10 print id of number 2. now when i press run then you can see two numbers nine seven eight four nine nine two and nine seven eight five one five two are printed this is the id of the number one object and this is the id of the number two object let me modify this program and i'll assign number one to number two so here i'll say number two equals number one and when i press run now you can see that both of these ids are the same this is because we are working with the same object python does this for memory optimization before moving to the next section of the video the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easier to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description how variables actually work suppose we have a code like this in our previous videos we have been saying that 5 is stored in a but this is technically wrong here a is more like a name tag and it can refer to any value currently it is referring to object 5. now if you create another variable b and assign a to it then both a and b will refer to the same object let me give you another example of this suppose we have a list like this so i'll say a equals 1 comma 2 comma 3 let me assign this variable to another variable so here i'll say b equals a now i'll modify a by adding one more element to it so i'll say a dot append and the element 4 next let me print the values of a and b so here i'll say print a equals a and print b equals b i'll run this code and you can see a and b both have the same value even though i have made no changes to b this is because a and b are referring to the same object as you can see i've done b equals a and if we check the id of the variables a and b they will be the same that's why we use the list copy method to copy one list to another if you do not want this kind of behavior so here i'll say a dot copy and now when i press run then you can see a and b don't have the same value because i have only modified a and b which was a copy of a is not modified at all that's it for this video you can find the source code of all these programs in our github repository the link will be in the description below and if you like this
