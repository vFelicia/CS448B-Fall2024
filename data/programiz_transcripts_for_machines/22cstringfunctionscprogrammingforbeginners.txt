what's up guys welcome back to this series on c programming in the last video we learned about string string is one of the frequently used concept in programming to make working with string easier c provides various string functions that are readily available for us to use in this video we will learn about four most important string function that are used to perform different operation on string so let's get started before we learn about string functions let's revise the working of string first so i'll go back to my code editor here i have the basic outline of a c program now i'll create a string care language is equals to c programming let me print this string using printf statement printf bracket percent s comma language as discussed in our last video we use percent s to print the string now i'll run this code as you can see we have successfully printed the string this is the basic understanding of how string works in c if you have some doubts about this i highly recommend you to watch our previous video you can see the link on the screen now let's start with the string function the styling function or string length function is used to find the length of a string let's see an example here is the code from our earlier program suppose i want to find the length of this string for that i can use strlin function but before that we have to import string.header file so i'll include here include string dot etch header file this is important because strlin function is a standard library function that is defined inside the string dot h header file now let's use the stanlean function i'll use printf statement here and backspace n length percent jet u comma strlin function and inside the function language here percent jet u is the format specifier that we use to print the return value of strlin function now let me run this code here you can see 13 as output the strlin function counts the total number of characters in the string by the way if you're watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description the strcpi function or string copy function is used to copy one string to another let's see an example suppose i have a string name food and i'll assign value pizza to this i want to copy this string to another string named best food so let me first declare the best best food string so best food string and inside the bracket i'll put still in and bracket food here i have used strlin function so that the length of the best foot string is same as the food string now let me use str's cpy function and i'll copy the string from food to best food so best food common food the sdrcpi function takes two value source string from where we want to copy and the destination string and i'll print the best food now so using printf statement percent as comma best food now i'll run this code here you can see the string is copied from the food to best food the str cat function or string concatenation function is used to join two string together let's see an example suppose we have two string cat text one is equals to hey and care text 2 is equals to it has value how are you now let's use sti cat function to join this string so strcat bracket text 1 comma text 2 i'll print this using printf statement so percent s comma text one now i'll run this code here you can see two strings are joined together however the output does not look nice so let me add here comma and a space and i'll run this again now you can see a clear output that are concatenated together okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the videos so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses the strcmp function or string comparison function is used to compare two string the function returns 0 if both the string are equal however if the string are not equal it returns a random nonzero value let's see an example suppose we have two string caret text one and i'll assign value a b c d and another string that is text 2 and i'll assign here value ef gh now let's compare these two string using strcmp function so i'll use strcmp function bracket here text 1 comma text 2 and since this function returns an integer i'll assign the return value to an integer so int result is equals to strcmp function now i'll print this using printf statement percent d because this time percent d because this time it gives us integer value and here we'll put result the name of the variable now i'll run this code here we get 4 as output which is a nonzero value because these two strings are not equal now let me change the value of this text to from efg to abcd and i'll run this again this time we get 0 as output because here the both string are equal apart from these four there are dozens of string function that can help us to work with string however remembering them is not possible instead what you can do is google and find the function that you need remember googling things is one of the most important skill in programming now to revise what you have learned in this program here is a programming task for you create a program to compare two string and print the larger string here is how the programs would work get two string input from the user using f gates compare the length of both the string using sdrlin and print the larger string you will find the answer to this question in our github repository and also if you want to revise this concept all this program will be there now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze which of the following function is used to join tostring comment your answer below see you in the next video happy programming you
