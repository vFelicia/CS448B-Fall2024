hey guys this is me padma from programmies and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we will learn to write comments in c programming we'll also see why comments are important so let's get started comments are hints that we add to our program to make our code easier to understand let's see an example i have this program that brings a variable to make this code a bit more readable i can add comment here like this create a variable and i'll add another comment here print the value of data variable here these lines that start with two forward slashes are comments we add them to make our program easier to understand for everyone let's see what happens when we run this program as you can see the program runs normally without any issue this is because c programming completely ignores the line that start with double forward slashes we can also put the comment and our code in the same line for that i'll cut this and put this in the same line with the code i'll do this for this comment as well now i'll run this code and see what happens you can see that the code before two forward slashes are executed and all comments are ignored we can add any number of comments anywhere in our program however if our code is selfexplanatory there is no need to use comments this only makes our code very messy so i'll remove these comments from the program okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses we can also use comments to debug our code it is a common practice to comment out code so that it is ignored rather than removing them completely let me give you an example in this example i have created a program to take a's and hide from the user suppose in this program i was not required to take the height input from the user so instead of removing the code related to height what i can do is i can simply add a double forward slash at the beginning of this line so that they become comments so to make them comments i'll just add forward slash here so i'm adding forward slash to every code that is related to height now the codes will be there if we need them in future but they are completely ignored by the c compiler now let me run this code as you can see it says enter the is i'll enter 29 and press enter here the output says is equals to 29 but these lines are completely ignored now later on if we need height again all we need to do is to remove these forward slashes and they will now become statement not comment now let me run this code again i'll enter the a is 29 and i'll add your height equals to 11 and you can see the output on the screen a little pro tip for you remember the keyword shortcut to apply comments in most text editors it's ctrl forward slash if you are on windows and command forward slash if you are on mac this will be very helpful in debugging our code by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skill in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description in c programming there is another type of comment that allow us to comment on multiple lines at once let me give you an example suppose we want to comment these three lines we can do that by typing forward slash and asterisk at the beginning and asterisk and forward slash at the end so let's do that forward slash and asterisk at the beginning and asterisk and forward slash at the end now let's run this code i'll enter 29 as you can see the code runs without any errors and these comments are ignored i can also use keyboard shortcut to use multiline comments let me show you first i'll remove this forward slash and asterisk at the beginning and i'll also remove this asterisk and forward slash at the end and i will select these three lines and press ctrl shift forward slash as you can see these lines are now commented if you are on mac you can press command shift forward slash here instead of ctrl shift forward slash if i press ctrl forward slash only these three lines will be commented at once but they will be commented with single line comments the multiline comments are useful if we need to explain the code a bit more and add more text to understand the code now let's take a moment to discuss why comments are important imagine that you are working on a huge project for a client since you were on a tight schedule you decide to ignore comments you successfully delivered it to the client and clients are happy about it fast forward in a couple of months the client want to update some features of project since you were the one who developed the project the client wants you to make the change without comments you will forget the reason why you wrote a particular piece of code a certain way and you will end up spending a lot of time looking at your own code and trying to understand it now if you had commented the code it would have been easier for you comments are even more important if you are working in a group it makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your code that being said comments are not and should not be used as a substitute to explain poorly written code you should always try to write clean understandable code and then use comment as an addition now that we are at the end of this video it's time for programming's quiz what is the correct way to comment in c programming comment your answer below if you want to revise this concept you can find all these programs in our github repository the link is in the video description see you in the next video happy programming
