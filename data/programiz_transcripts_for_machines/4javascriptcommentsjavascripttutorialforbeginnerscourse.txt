what's up guys i'm puli from programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn to write javascript comments and see why they are important comments are hints that we add to our program to make our code easier to understand let's see an example i have this program to print the name of a user so the program looks something like this so i create a variable called name and let me hard code punit into it and then i'll say console.log name i'll use the string concatenation or plus operator and say the name is the variable name or the value of the variable name to make this program a bit more readable i can add a comment like this so on the top i'll say program to print the user's name this line that starts with two forward slashes is a comment we added this line to make our program easier to understand for anyone reading our code let's see what happens when we run this program when i press run it says name punit as you can see the program runs normally without any issues this is because javascript completely ignores the line that starts with two forward slashes we can also place comments after the code statement like this so here after the console log i can say print the name variable now i can run this code and you can see that i get the same output the comments are completely ignored though we can add comments anywhere in our program we should not add unnecessary comments this only makes our code very cluttered and messy since the code in our program is also selfexplanatory let me remove these two comments so i'll remove this one and i'll remove this one as well we can also use comments to debug our code suppose we are experimenting with our code and sometimes we might not need some piece of code during the test in such situations it is a good practice to comment out quotes so that it is ignored by the compiler rather than removing the code completely let me give you an example i'll write a program to take a name and age input from the user so let me remove this old code and i'll say let me write the comment first program to take users name and age let me create the name variable so i can say name equals prompt enter name similarly age equals prompt enter age now let me console log the name oops let me make this capital letters and use the string concatenation operator the plus operator similarly i can say age and plus age suppose in this program it was no longer required for us to take the age input from the user so instead of removing these two lines which accept the edge and print it i can just convert this into a comment by adding two slashes in the beginning now there are comments and they're ignored by the javascript compiler let me run this program and it's enter name let me enter punit and it says name punit this line and this line were completely ignored and that's why they were not run now later on if we need to use the h variable again all we need to do is remove these two forward slashes and this code will run it will ask me for the name and age and now my program works as expected this is because these two lines now are statements instead of comments since i've removed the two forward slashes in front of them a little pro tip for you remember the keyboard shortcut to apply comments in most text editors and in our online compiler as well it's command in mac or control in windows plus forward slash so i can do this in one go right from the keyboard this will be very useful in debugging our code if you're enjoying this video please also check out programs pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount in javascript there's also another type of comment that allows us to comment multiple lines together let me give you an example so i'll remove this old code and let me write a long comment so as this program is used to take the name of the user similarly in the next line as you can get the name from the user and display the result now i'll write the code prompt enter your name similarly i can say console.log name and then the string concatenation num and name now i want these three lines to be comments we can do that by typing the forward slash and asterisk at the beginning similarly at the end i will need to type the asterisk and the forward slash and now these lines are a multiline comment there's also an alternative way to do this let me remove the multiline comment operator first and what i can also do is i can select these three lines and i can use the keyboard shortcut that i told you about before so command slash since i am on a mac but for windows it will be control slash or linux as well so i'll press command slash and you can see that this was immediately converted to comments let me run this code and let me put sarah as the name and you can see that my program works as expected multiline comments are useful if you need to explain the code a bit more or need to add more text to understand the code in this case you must have noticed that when i use the keyboard shortcut it actually made single line comments out of two lines but some editors might do this and make this a multiline comment as well so this differs from text editor to text editor whatever the case if you use the shortcut it these lines will always become comments okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so

moment to discuss why comments are important imagine you're working on a huge web development project for a client since you were on a tight schedule you decided to ignore comments you successfully delivered it to the clients and they're happy about it fast forward a couple of months the client wants to update some features of the project since you were the one who developed the project the client wants you to make that change now without comments you will forget the reasons why you wrote a particular piece of code a certain way and you'll end up spending a lot of time looking at your own code and trying to understand it comments are even more important if you're working in a group it makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your code that being said comments are not and should not be used as a substitute to explain poorly written code you should always try to write clean understandable code and then use comments as an addition now that we have reached the end of the video it's time for the programming squares which of the following operators is used as a comment in javascript comment your answer below and if you want to revise this concept you can find all the programs in our github repository i'll put the link in the video description below happy programming you
