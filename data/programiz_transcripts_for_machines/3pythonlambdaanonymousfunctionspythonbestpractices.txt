lambda functions are single line functions defined without a name in this video we will learn to create and use lambda functions in python with the help of examples so let's get started before we learn about lambda functions let me create a simple normal function that takes an argument and doubles it so on my code compiler i'll say def double n let me return n times 2 now i'll test drive this i'll say print double 10 and when i press run you must have expected i get 20. this function has only one statement in its body would it be neat if you could write this one line of function in a more condensed way well python lambda functions allow us to do exactly that let me show you what i mean i'll go back to my code compiler and here let me first comment this line now i'll create a variable called double so i'll say double equals and i'll assign a lambda function to this variable so to assign a lambda function i'll say l a m b d a lambda then the function parameter which is n followed by a column and then the return value which is n times 2. let me run this code again so when i press run i get the same value as before here n that is before the column is the parameter that is needed by the function if we need we can pass multiple parameters as well by separating them with commas just like with normal functions and the part after the column is the return value of the function also notice that the lambda function doesn't have any name that's why lambda functions are also called anonymous functions the one thing you need to remember about lambda function is that it can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression now let's try to create a lambda function with multiple arguments i will create a lambda function that returns the larger among two numbers so here i can say larger equals lambda and i'll call the arguments a and b so i can say a and b are the two numbers and i'll return a if a is greater than b otherwise i'll return b now let me call this lambda function so here i'll say print larger of 10 and 47. when i run this code you can see that 47 which is the larger number is returned and printed by the way if you're finding this video useful a sub to the channel would be much appreciated before moving to the next section of the video the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easier to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description at this point you must be wondering when to use lambda functions let me show you one more example where i will use the lambda function as a key to sort a list in a custom way suppose we have a list like this to sort this list alphabetically we use the list sort method let me demonstrate this so here i'll say names.sort and now if i print the names and press run you can see that the names were sorted in alphabetical order instead of this suppose we want to sort the items of this list based on the length of the name we can do this by passing an optional key argument to the sort method let me show you what i mean so here i'll say names.sort and here i'll say key equals now the key will be a lambda and it will take an argument now i'll return the length of the string now when i press run you can see that the names were sorted in the basis of the length instead of alphabetically this is because the sort method uses the length of each string as the key while sorting as you can see we didn't have to define a separate function for this small task we directly defined the lambda function inside the function call itself which made our code much more concise lambda functions are used more frequently with python builtin functions like map filter and reduce we will cover these topics in the next video so stay tuned that's it for this video if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository i'll also put this link in the video description below and if you like this video hit that like button and subscribe to the channel and see you in the next one happy programming you
