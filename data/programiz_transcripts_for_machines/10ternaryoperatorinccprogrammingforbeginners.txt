hey guys this is padma from programmies and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we'll learn about the ternary operator which can be used to replace if else statement in certain situation to make our code look cleaner so let's get started let's start with syntax of turning operator on the screen you can see the basic structure of ternary operator the ternary operator starts with the test condition like x is less than 0 or name equals to podma or any other boolean expression that evaluates to true or false if this test condition results in true this first expression before the column is executed and if the test condition is false then the second expression after the colon is executed here you can see there are three operands hence the name ternary operator now you know the syntax of ternary operator let's see an example here you can see the basic c program now i'll create an in variable is and assign value 15 to this then i'll create a ternary operator with the condition is is greater than or equals to 18 and if this condition is true i'll print you can vote so printf inside quotation i'll put you can vote and if that condition is false i'll print you cannot vote so i'll end this statement with the semicolon now let me run this code as you can see you cannot vote is printed here is is equals to 15 so this condition becomes 15 is greater than or equal to 18 which is false so this print statement after the column is printed on the screen now let me change this value from 15 to 24 now this condition becomes 24 is greater than or equals to 18 which is true so this print statement before the column should be executed now let's run this code as expected we get you can vote as output here we have used print statement as expression inside the ternary operator however we can also store value from ternary operator to a variable and use the variable later let's see an example i'll remove this line and create a care variable called operator and i'll i'll assign plus to this then i'll create an integer variable num1 and i'll assign a value a to this and i'll create another invariable end num2 and i'll assign value 7 to this now i'll cut this turnit operator and start with a new condition and i'll check if operator is equals to plus and if this condition is true i'll add num1 with num2 and i'll add colon here and if this condition is false i'll subtract num2 from num1 so num1 minus num2 this expression are returning some value so i'll assign this ternary operator to a variable so say int result and i'll print this variable using printf statement printf inside quotation i'll use percent d format specifier and the name of the variable that is result i'll run this code and you can see we get 15 as output which is the sum of 8 and 7. here the operator is equals to plus so this condition is true and addition is performed between num1 and num2 depending upon your requirement you can either print values directly or assign value to a variable from a ternary operator however if you plan to use values later in the program it's a good idea to store value in a variable by the way if you are watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description in some of the cases we can replace the if else statement with a ternary operator this will make our code cleaner and shorter let me show you an example on your screen you can see a program that checks if you can vote or not using the fl statement on the right and turn it operator on the left both the program are doing the same tags and checking if a person can vote or not and you can see the use of ternary operator has made our code cleaner and shorter in such programs where we need to do a single task inside the if else statement we can use the ternary operator in a place of if else however if there are multiple lines of code inside the if else statement we should never replace that with the ternary operator this will make our code more confusing and messy okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free

people can discover and enjoy these courses now to revise what we have learned here is one programming task for you to solve can you create a program to check whether a number is odd or even to create this program create a variable name number and assign a value to it then using a ternary operator check if the number variable is odd or even if the number is odd print the number is odd and if the number is even print the number is even you will find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise the concept you can find all this program there the link is in the video description now that we are at the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze what is the correct ternary equivalent of the following ifelse statement comment your answer below see you on the next video happy programming you
