what's up guys i'm punishment programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about the for loop and use it to repeat a block of code multiple times we will also learn about two different versions of the for loop for in and for off loop so let's get started in the last video we learned about the while loop similar to the while loop we can also use a for loop to repeat a block of code for a required number of times however the syntax of a for loop is different from the while loop so let's first look at the syntax of the for loop the for loop starts with the keyword for followed by initialization condition and object expression wrapped up in parenthesis the initialization expression declares and initializes a variable that we'll need inside the for loop for example it can be something like let i equals 1. here the variable i is initialized with value 1 the initialization expression is executed only once in a for loop next is the condition expression it's a boolean expression like i less than 5 it evaluates to either true or false if the condition is true the code inside the for loop is executed then the update expression is executed as well the update expression updates the value of the variable for example it can be something like i plus plus or i could have also written i equals i plus 1. here the update expression increases the value of i by 1 in each iteration so the value of i becomes 2 in the second iteration now this condition is evaluated again and if it's true the code inside the for loop is executed again and the update expression again is executed at the end so the value of i now becomes three this process continues until the condition is false if the condition is false the for loop is terminated let's see an example to drive home the point further suppose i want to print a message five times then i can use a for loop to run it five times so let me create a for loop and inside the initialization i can say let i equals one since i want to print the message five times i'll write a condition i less than equals five and i'll update the value of i by 1 in each iteration so i'll say i plus plus inside the for loop let me print the message so i'll put two messages learning for loop and similarly javascript is fun let me also print the value of i so that we know what's happening inside the loop let me run this code as you can see the messages i've written are printed five times now let's see what's happening here during the for loop initialization the variable i is assigned the value one now the condition i less than or equal to five is tested since this is true the body of the loop is executed and that's what gives us the output learning for loop javascript is fun and the value of i which is one then the update expression i plus plus is executed which increases the value of i by 1 to 2. now this test condition is evaluated again 2 less than or equal to 5 is true and this body is again executed and that's why we get learning forward loop javascript is fun and the value of i which is 2 this process continues for the value of i from 1 to 5 when the value of i becomes 6 this test condition 6 less than or equal to 5 is false and the loop terminates in this way the messages are printed five times from i equal one to five if you're enjoying this video please also check out

to claim your discount now that we know the working of a for loop let's create a more practical example i'll use the for loop to create a multiplication table up to 10. so i'll start by asking the user to provide a numeric value and i'll store it in the variable let me remove this or code and i can say const number equals pars in to convert from string to number and prompt to get the input from the user so i'll say enter a number the multiplication starts from 1 so let me create an initialization expression as count equals 1. so for let count equals 1. since i'm printing the multiplication table up to 10 i'll use the for loop to run for 10 times here i'll use the condition count less than or equal to 10 so count less than equals 10 and my update expression will increase the value of count by one so i'll say count plus plus inside the for loop i'll multiply the number passed by the user with the count variable and store it obviously in a variable so let me create const product equals number which is the number given by the user times count so i'll use template strings to print the result i can say console.log and then the tilde dollar number x or times dollar count equals dollar product as you can see i've used template strings to print the output in a nice format this will make our output look something like 8 multiplied by 1 equals 8 8 multiplied by 2 equals 16 and so on let me run this code and i'll enter something like 9 and press enter and as you can see i got the multiplication table of 9. here we're multiplying the number by the value of count inside the for loop we know that the value of count is increased by one in each iteration so the value of count starts with one and number was 9 so product was 9 times 1 in the second iteration the value of count was 2 so the product becomes 9 times 2 and so on that's how we get the multiplication table of 9 from 1 to 10. in javascript there's another version of for loop called the for in loop which is used to loop over all keys of an object before we go forward let's learn a bit about objects first we use an object to store collections of data for example if you want to store information about a student like name age and grade we can create an object like this so i'll go to my code editor and let me create an object called student and student is a student object can be created by using the curly braces and inside this i can say name colon string like monica similarly i can store a number like grade and another number like age here student is an object that store information in key value pairs name is a key and the string monica is the value similarly grade is a key and 7 is the value now while working with objects we can use the for in loop to iterate over the keys of an object let me write a foreign loop to iterate over the keys of this object student so i can say for let data in student and curly braces as usual here data represents the key of the student object and in each iteration i want to print the key and the value so i can say console.log and then again the string template strings so i can say dollar data and let me put an arrow and let me see student data in the first iteration data is assigned the name key in the second iteration data is assigned the grade key and in the third iteration of the loop data is assigned as age and the student data you see here gives me the actual value of the key so in the first iteration this becomes student name which is monica and in the second iteration i get 7 and in this third iteration i get 12. so here i've tried to print both the key and the value together let me press run and you can see that i got the output i was looking for the key and the value together if you do not know about objects and are finding this a bit difficult to understand don't worry just understand the working of for in loop for now we will go deeper into objects in the later videos okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the videos leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses besides for and for in loops javascript also has a for off loop this was introduced in the newer version of javascript known as javascript es6 or ecmascript 2015. the for off loop allows us to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays before we learn more let's learn a bit about arrays first an array contains a list of items of either the same or different data types suppose we want to store names of students this is where we can use an array so i'll go back to my code editor and i'll say const students equals john sarah and c jack here the students array contains three elements john sarah and jack now we can use the for off loop to iterate over the array elements i'll write for and inside the parenthesis let me say let data of students you must have guessed by now if i say console.log data data will first contain john then sarah and then jack in this way we can access all the elements of the array one by one i'll run this code and as you can see john sarah and jack are printed we'll dive deeper into arrays and how the for loop works with ios in later videos so don't worry if you're feeling confused we can also use the for off loop to access other iterable objects like sets maps and strings let's see one example of using for off to iterate over a string so let me remove this old code and i'll start by creating a variable name language so i'll say const language equals javascript now i want to use the for off loop to iterate through each character of the string so i can say for correct let character of language and i'll say console.log character you must have guest output by now when i press run you can see that i got all the characters of the string javascript that's because a string is essentially a collection of characters and that's why we get each character when using the for off loop with a string now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you can you use the for loop to print all the even numbers from 1 to 100 the output would be something like this you'll find the answer to this question now github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs there as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we've reached the end of this video it's time for the programming squeeze which of the following loops is used to iterate over keys of an object comment answer below and happy programming
