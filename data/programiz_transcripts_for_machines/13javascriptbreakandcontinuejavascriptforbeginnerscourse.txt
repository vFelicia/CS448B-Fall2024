what's up guys i'm punish from programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about the break and continue statements and use them with loops to change the normal flow of a loop so let's get started in programming the break statement immediately terminates the loop when it is encountered before we move forward let's see the working of a for loop first here i'll use the for loop code to loop over and display the value of i in each iteration for 5 iterations so i can say 4 let i equals 1 i less than equals 5 and i plus plus and inside i'll just say console log i let me run this program and as you can see i got the numbers from 1 to 5. now let me add a break statement inside the loop i'll add it after the print statement so i can say break and now let me run this program again this time i only get one as output let's see what happened here during the first iteration the value of i is one which is printed by this console log then the break statement is executed and it immediately terminates the loop to see this clearly let me add another print statement after the break so here i'll say console.log after break now when i press run i get the same output as before because the break statement terminates the loop immediately anything after it is never executed generally the break statement is used with conditional statements that way we can break the loop only under certain conditions let's see an example i'll use the same code here i'll remove the break statement and the second print statement so i'll remove these two and before the console log let me say something like if i equals 3 break let me run this code and you can see that 1 and 2 are printed for the first iteration the value of i is 1. since 1 less than equals to 5 is true i get inside the body of the for loop now since 1 is not equal to true we skip this if and 1 is printed by the console log that we can see here in the next iteration i is increased to 2 and since 2 less than or equals to 5 is true i go inside the body of the for loop now since 2 is not 3 this break is not executed and the console log prints 2. now in the next iteration when i is 3 3 is 3 is true or 3 equals 3 is true and break is executed that means no statements after this will be executed and we get outside the loop and that's why 3 was never printed here let us see an example of a break statement with the while loop i'll create a program that will ask input values from the user if the user enters a positive number i'll print the number and ask for another number this process will continue until the user enters a negative number when the user enters a negative number i will just terminate the while loop since i want to terminate the loop with the break statement let me start with a while loop that is always true so let me remove this old code and i'll say while true here the condition of the loop is true which means unless a break statement is encountered the loop will keep running now inside this loop i'll accept a number from the user so let number equals parse float and then prompt i think i screwed up the spelling of float yup prompt enter a number and then i'll use an if statement to check if the number is less than 0 and inside the statement i'll execute the break statement so here i can say if number less than 0 then break this means that the loop is terminated if the input value is negative i'll then add a print statement to print the input value so outside the if i can say console dot log number let me run this code and i'll enter something like 5 when i press enter 5 is successfully printed let me try something like 9 and you can see that 9 is also printed now let me enter a negative number like 4 and you can see that the program ended because the loop is now terminated let's go into detail to see what's happening with the code here i've created a while loop that is always true now in the first iteration i entered 5 so number has the value 5 since 5 less than 0 is false this break is not executed and the number is printed in the next iteration i entered 9 so number is 9 and 9 less than 0 is again false so the break statement is never executed and console log number prints 9. in the third iteration however i entered minus 4 and since 4 less than 0 is true we encountered the break statement and the loop ended there and then

current iteration of the loop and starts the loop from the next iteration let's see an example on my screen you can see a previous code i used to demonstrate the break statement if the value of i is 3 then we break out of the loop let me replace the break with a continue statement so i'll say continue and then run the code you can see that instead of breaking out of the code only three is skipped from this loop let's try to understand what happened here and why 3 was not printed during the first iteration the value of the variable i was 1 now i 1 less than 5 is ok and we go inside the body of the loop and since 1 is not equals 3 we don't go to the continue statement so console.log i printed one similarly in the second iteration i is now two this is skipped and console log i prints two now things get interesting when i is three so when i is 3 equals 3 is true and we encounter the continue statement the continue statement does not allow anything else to execute inside the for loop and takes me directly to the update expression with which increases the value of i to 4 so 4 and 5 get printed and when i become 6 we exit out of the loop okay guys we need your support to keep these

high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses we now know the working of break and continue let's use them together in a single loop i will create a program that asks an input value from the user however i want users to input only positive values so when a user inputs a negative value or 0 i'll end the loop also to make the program more interesting i will only print the number if it's even so if the user inputs an odd number i will use the continue statement so that odd values are not printed let's get started so i hope you remember this quote from our earlier program here the break statement is already executed and it breaks the loop or ends the loop if the input value is negative since i only want to print even numbers i'll need to use the continue statement if the number is odd so let me add an if statement here i'll say if number modulo 2 not equals 0 continue here the modulo operator returns the remainder when number is divided by 2. if this remainder is equal 0 then it's an even number so since i want to find odd numbers i'll say not equals to 0. this condition then tells me if the number is odd or not if the number is odd then i just want to continue i don't want to print the number at all let's run this code i'll enter something like 4 and when i press enter you can see that 4 got printed now let me enter an odd number like 9 and you can see that nothing got printed that means my continue is working now let me again enter an even number like 28 and it's getting printed fine now let's break out of the loop by doing a negative number like minus 34 and when i press enter you can see that i broke out of the loop here you can see when the input value is odd the condition number modulo 2 not to 0 make sure that this console log is not executed but i still keep on going with the loop because the continue statement does not break me out of the loop but just helps me go to the next iteration while skipping the rest of the loop similarly when the input value is negative the condition number less than 0 breaks out of the loop however when the input is a positive even number both of these conditions number less than 0 and number modulo 2 not equals to 0 are false the flow of the program goes to console log number and that's why 4 and 28 were printed on the screen now to practice what we've learnt here's a programming task for you can you create a program that takes the input from the user if the user enters a single digit number print the number if the user enters a negative or double digit number ask the user for another number and if the user enters a number greater than 100 terminate the loop you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for the programmers quiz which of the following keywords is used to terminate a loop terminate break continue loop commit answer below happy programming you
