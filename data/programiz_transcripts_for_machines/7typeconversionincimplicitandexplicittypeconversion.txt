hey guys i'm padma from programmies and welcome back to this series on c programming in this video we will learn to convert one data type to another in c we will also learn about different types of type conversion in c programming so let's get started before we talk about type conversion let's quickly see an example here we have two end variable a and b with value 5 and 9 respectively and we have used plus operator to add these two numbers now let's run this code you can see we get 14 as an output which is 5 plus 9. now let me change one of the data to cat type so here i'll change the data type of a to care care a equals to 5 and i'll put here single quotation around 5. now we are performing addition between integer and character variable now let me run this program as you can see that the code runs without any error and we get 62 as an output let's see what's happening here we are adding character value 5 and an integer value 9 in this case the compiler automatically converts this character value into ascii value so the character 5 is converted into its ascii value which is 53 so the final output is 53 plus 9 equals to 62. now let's try another example this time i'll change this character data to double and make this 5 into a floating point number and i'll add here 0.67 now in this case we are adding double and in type variable now i'll run this code here we get 14 as an output it looks like the double value is converted into in value 5 and then added to 9 which gives us 14 but that's not the case here actually the end value 9 is converted into double value 9.00 then it is added to the double value 5.67 making it 14.67 however the sum is stored in the result variable which is of in type so the double type sum 14.67 is now converted to an ntype value 14 hence we get the output 14. we can verify this by changing the data type of result variable let me show you i'll change this result variable to double so double result equals to a plus b similarly i'll use percent lf instead of percent d and now i'll run this this time you will see 14.67 with multiple zeros after that you might be wondering why the int value is converted into double why not the double converted to int well the type conversion occur according to the data type hierarchy here the data type that is lower in this hierarchy is always converted to the data type that comes higher for example between care and int cad data type is converted to int and between int and double the in data type is converted to double we can say that the lower data type is promoted to higher data type however if you have noticed we have assigned double value to an end variable the double value is converted to the end value this is because during the assignment the data type on the right of the assignment operator is always converted to the data type on the left in this case sometimes the higher data type can also be demoted to lower data type let's see an example i'll create an end variable and a equals to 5.67 and print this using printf function percent d comma a now when i run this you can see that we gave the integer value 5 as an output during the conversion from the higher data type like double to lower data type like ind there might be loss of some data in our program the data 5.67 is converted to 5 there is a loss of data 0.67 during this conversion so we should be careful during this type of conversion here all the type conversion are happening automatically this is called implicit type conversion we can also forcefully convert one data type to another this type of conversion is called explicit type conversion by the way if you're watching this there is a good chance you want to improve your skills in c programming lucky for you we have a mobile app that provides a wellstructured c programming course with certification at the end and you can use the app alongside the video to practice on the builtin compiler our course is free so download now by scanning this qr code or click the link in the video description before we learn about explicit type conversion let's get back to our earlier code here we are adding double type variable a with an entire variable b normally we know that the entire variable b will be converted to a double type and then the addition is performed what if we want the double value to be converted to end and then add the end value this is where we use explicit type conversion let me show you i'll add in inside this parenthesis in front of a so here the end inside the bracket before a tells the compiler to convert the variable a to in type now let me run this code as you can see we get 14.00 as an output here this end inside the bracket changes the double value 5.67 to int and then adds this value 9 to it and then the sum is 14 which is assigned to result variable since the result is double variable 14 is converted to double and gives us output 14.000 and multiple other zeros after that since the result is also in i can now change the data type of result into ind and don't forget to change the format specifier from percent lf to percent d and then i'll run this again this time we'll get 14 as an output okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the video so leave a comment below press that like button and hit subscribe if you haven't already let's get the engagement score high up so that more people can discover and enjoy these courses similarly we can also convert an in data type to double by using double keyword inside the bracket before the variable name let me show you here i'll remove this code now i'll create two end variable int a and assign value 9 and create another in variable int b equals to 2 now i'll perform the division between a and b and store the result in a double variable so double result equals a divided by b then this print f bracket inside quotation percent lf comma result now let me run this code here we get 4 as an output not 4.5 this is because we perform division between two individual value the result will be quotient so we get 4 as an output which is the quotient value however we want the actual result 4.5 after the division then we can use the explicit type conversion to convert one of the variable to double and perform division so here i'll add double before the variable a now let's run this now we get 4.5 as output here we have only converted the variable a to double type but still we get the output this is because now the variable a is of double type and if we perform operation between double and int the int data type is implicitly converted to the double type hence b here is also converted to double type now the division between 9.0 and 2.0 is equals to 4.5 now that we are at the end of this video it's time for programming squeeze what is the value of result in the following statement and comment your answer below see you in the next video happy
