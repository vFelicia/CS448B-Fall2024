what motivates me to work so hard in this is the mission of program is because uh when i started you know when i was in college there was so much difficulty in finding the right resources when you're student you're poor you don't have enough money to buy premium courses so you're completely dependent on free resources like youtube and websites quality content is a basic need with which i struggled with myself i still remember there was this one exam of data structures and algorithms and there was this heap sort algorithm that i was struggling with and then i saw this one youtube video where you know it was explained so beautifully um i i watched that video and i excelled in that exam and and even now you know i'm teaching data structures and algorithms on programming through text content that we write lack of content is something that you know is it's something that troubles me and i i because i've personally gone through the journey was a good quality content that someone else created helped me pass not just pass my exam but you know help me understand the concept better i'm passionate about that and that's what drives
