what's up guys i'm puneet from programmers and welcome back to the series on python in the previous videos we learned about textual data and numbers now we will learn to perform operations on this data using something called operators more specifically we will focus on arithmetic operations like addition subtraction etc in this video in programming an operator is a symbol that is used to perform operations on values and variables we've already used the equals operator in our previous videos so we've been saying stuff like name equals punit here the equals operator takes the value on the right and stores it in the variable on the left we'll get back to more assignment operators in a second let's start with arithmetic operators first we use arithmetic operators to perform arithmetic operations such as addition subtraction multiplication etc i'll copy a list of arithmetic operators here in my text editor so that it's a bit easy for us to use them let's try these operators one by one i'll start with the plus operator so i'll say something like x equals 5 and then i can say result equals x plus 10 and then i can print the result here i'll run this code and as you can see 15 is printed what's happening here is 10 and the value of x which is 5 are being added by the addition operator and the equals to operator is storing the result of these in the result variable on line 12 when i print the result because its value is 5 plus 10 or 15 that's what was printed instead of storing the result of adding 10 and x to the result variable we can also directly print the result like this so i can copy this and i can paste it here i'll remove the result variable for now and when i press run i get the same result because the addition operator still takes the value of x and 10 and adds them up and that's what's get printed by the print function but personally i think using a variable to store the result looks a bit cleaner than this so i'll revert back to the old code before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below we have learned to perform the addition operator at this point now let's try all these operators one by one let me change plus to minus and run this as you can see minus 5 is printed because 5 minus 10 is minus 5. in python we use the asterisk symbol for multiplication so i'll replace this minus by asterisk and when i press run then 5 times 10 50 is printed similarly the forward slash is used for division so i'll replace this asterisk by slash and when i press run then 5 divided by 10 or 0.5 is stored in the result variable and that's what got printed here the symbols of these four operators addition subtraction multiplication and division are similar to symbols in mathematics let's try three more arithmetic operators the single asterisk is used for multiplication but if we use two asterisks without any space in between it's an exponent operator so i'll replace this slash with 2 asterisk and when i press run i'll remove this 10 and i'll make it 2 and when i press run then as you can see 25 is stored in the result because 5 raised to the power 2 or 5 times 5 is 25 the last two arithmetic operators are percent and two forward slashes using two forward slashes computes the quotient when one number is divided by another similarly the percent symbol computes the remainder when one number is divided by another let me give you an example so here i'll replace this result and i'll say quotient equals x double slash 2 and then i can say remainder equals x modulus 2 so the modulus this sign when used to calculate the remainder is called modulus and then i can say quotient is quotient and remainder is remainder when i press run then it says quotient is 2 and remainder is 1 that is because when 5 is divided by 2 the quotient is 2 obviously because 2 times 2 is 4 and the remainder 1 is stored in the remainder variable at this point we have covered everything we need to know about arithmetic operators when they are used with numbers before ending this section i have a pro tip for you we use a lot of operators in a single statement like this it's harder to understand which operation is performed first in this statement to avoid this we can use parenthesis so i can wrap these by parentheses like this and now it's so much easier to understand in the last section we use the plus operator to add two numbers the plus operator also serves another purpose in python it is used to join two strings let me give you an example so i'll remove this whole code and i say str1 equals hey and i'll say str2 equals jude and then i can print the concatenation of hey and jude like this when i press run then hey jude is printed it's working but let me add a space between hey and jude for that i can add a space at the end of hey and when i press run then as you can see there's a space now we have already used the most common assignment operator equals which is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left in python you can also do something like this so i can say x comma y equals 5 comma 6 here 5 is assigned to the x variable and 6 is assigned to the y variable in one statement so this code is equivalent to x equals five y equals six personally i i feel this later syntax of x equals five and y equals to six is better because it makes the code easier to read there are also some compound assignment operators in python these compound assignment operators combine arithmetic and assignment operators in one single place i'll show you an example so i'll remove this old code and i can say x equals 5 and i'll say x plus equals 10 and i'll also say x minus equals 10. this x plus equals 10 is equivalent to x equals to x plus 10 this plus equals to operator is called the addition assignment operator because it first performs the addition then performs the assignment similarly the x minus equal 10 is equivalent to x equals x minus 10. these compound assignment operators are available with all arithmetic operators there are also other numerous operators in python which we will learn about as we progress further in the video series if you are curious you can visit our website programmers.com for more information on python operators along with numerous examples the link will be in the description below let's put the things we have learned in this video in action suppose you're a university student and you need to pay 4535 dollars tuition fee for the next semester the college is giving you a discount of 10 percent on early payment of your tuition fee since it's a very good offer you decided to make an early payment now can you find out how much money you have to pay i'll store the fee in a variable called fee so i'll say fee equals 4535 now my discount percentage will also go in a variable called discount percent and from here i can calculate the discount amount as discount percent by 100 i'll add parenthesis to form clarity times the fee this should be discount amount and then i can say discounted underscore fee equals fee minus discount amount now let me print the discount amount so i can say print fee after discount is discounted underscore fee and when i press run then ik i get the correct value of the fee after discount now it's time for you to solve a problem can you create a program to convert distance in kilometers to miles suppose you have a distance in kilometers stored in a variable like this so i can say distance underscore km equals 564.5 you need to convert this distance to miles using the formula one kilometer equals 0.621371 miles you will find the answer to this question in our github repository i'll also put this link in the description below before we end this video here's a recap of what we learned today the most common assignment operator is the equals operator it is used to assign the value in the right to the variable on the left we use arithmetic operators to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition subtraction etc if you use the plus operator with numbers it adds two numbers however if you use the plus operator with strings it joins two strings if you use multiple operators in an expression we can use parenthesis to make our code readable that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i posted the link in the description below feel free to copy the programs and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below join me in this video series and let's explore the exciting world of programming together
