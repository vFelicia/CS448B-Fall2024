what's up guys i'm funny from programmers and welcome back to the series on javascript in the last video we learned about javascript strings in javascript strings are probably the most frequently used data type to make working with strings easier javascript has numerous string methods readily available for us to use in this video we will learn about various string methods that are used to perform different operations on strings so let's get started as the name suggests the two uppercase method converts any string to uppercase suppose i have a string like this so on my code editor i'll say const text equals i like javascript let's say we want to convert all the characters to uppercase now to do this we can use the two uppercase method so i can say const result equals text dot 2 upper case and parenthesis remember that u and c are capital letters here now let me see what i get in the result when i press run you can see that this string that had a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters is now all in uppercase similarly if you want to convert all the characters to lowercase we can use the two lowercase method so i'll start with something like i like javascript and let me change this to two lowercase oops lowercase and when i press run you can see that all the uppercase letters like i j and s were converted to lowercase the concat method joins two or more strings suppose i have these two strings const s text one equals javascript and const text two equals programming now let's use the concat method to join these two strings together i can say const result equals text1.concat text2 and let me print the result as always when i press run you must have guessed the output by now i get javascript combined with programming if you're enjoying this video

give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount the replace method is used to replace a string with another string suppose i have a string value that says hello my name is punit so i'll say const text equals hello my name is puneet now if i want to replace the text hello with hi i can simply use the replace method let me show you how so i'll say const result equals text dot replace and for the first argument it will be hello and the second argument will be high here the method replace replaces the first argument or the value in the first argument with the second argument that means text has hello which is here and it will be replaced by hi let me console log the result and press run and you can see that instead of hello my name is punit i now get hi my name is punit the split method is used to split a string into an array of individual elements suppose we have a sentence like this on my screen you can see a variable called text containing a sentence now i want to use the split method to split the string into individual words i can do that by saying const result equals text dot split and a string having just a space this will split the string into individual words or in fact any character i put inside this can be used so console.log result and you must have guessed the output by now i will get an array of strings each string will be a word in the sentence now the split method is interesting because we can also use it to derive the characters from a word so instead of a sentence i can say something like text equals to javascript and now i can say cons result equals text dot split now since i don't want to split it by anything or i want to split it by the empty string i can just put an empty string here and now when i do console.log text or a result and press run you can see that i got an array of each letter in the word javascript the slice method extracts the required string from the given string suppose we have a string like this so again i'll go back to my old code that contains the string javascript now if i want to extract java from the string i can use the slice method as const result equals text dot slice and 0 comma 4 the slice method takes two arguments in this case it's 0 and 4 the first argument 0 is the start index of the string that we want to extract in this case it's j which is at the zero index the second argument is the end index in this case it is s and not a so i want to extract java but this the way the slice works is i want to give the end index that is exclusive or that is not included so i want to go one step further than i need to now if i do console.log result and press run you can see that i get java okay guys we need your support to keep these types of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on the

method removes the extra white space from the strings suppose we have a string in fact let me not get a new string i'll add spaces before and after this javascript string let me remove this dot and now i want to remove these extra spaces from the beginning and the end all i need to do is const result equals text dot trim and now if i do console.log result i get a beautiful string with no spaces at the front and at the end in javascript we can use the search method to search for a substring in a given string suppose i have a string like this so const text equals javascript is fun now i want to search for the substring fun in this string here i can use the search method like this so i can say const result equals text dot search and fun let me console log the result and press run and you can see that i get a weird number uh 14 but when i let's do a small exercise so i'll start from j with zero and we'll go ahead so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 that means 14 is the index of the first appearance of the word fun within the text string in case the method could not find a substring inside the string it returns 1 let me modify this code so here i will say funny and press run and you can see that this time i got 1 apart from the string methods i mentioned in this video the javascript string provides many more methods to perform different operations on string if you want to learn about all of them you can visit our website www.programmings.com i will put the link in the video description below now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you create a string i love java convert the string to lowercase and check if the string consists of the substring java if yes replace the substring java with javascript you'll find the answer to this question in a github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we have reached the end of this video it's time for the programming quiz what is the output of this program comment answer below and i'll see you in the next video happy programming
