what's up guys i'm punit from programmers and welcome back to the series on python in the last video we learned about the while loop to repeat a block of code until our test condition is false in this video we will look at the for loop which is used to loop over a sequence so let's get started before we look at the working of the for loop we need to understand about sequences a sequence is a collection of items in an order we have already used strings numerous times in our programs a string is basically a sequence of characters as you can see in the image the string python is a sequence of seven characters p y t h o and n let's look at another type of sequence this sequence has three items separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets this sequence is called a list we will learn about these sequences in detail in the upcoming videos for now just remember that a sequence in python is a collection of items in an order now that we know what sequences are let's get back to our main topic for loop the for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence and in each iteration we can access individual items of that sequence for example in my code editor i'll show you suppose we have a string like this using a for loop we can access individual items of the string python one by one now i'll create a for loop here i'll say for character in text then i'll print the character using our handy print function when i press run we can see that each character of the string python is printed one by one let's see how this program works during the first iteration of this for loop the variable character will have the value p which is the first letter in the text python and that will be printed to the screen in the next iteration the value of y will be stored in the variable character and when we print character y is printed to the screen this goes on until we reach n after which the for loop exits by the way we are seeing each character in a new line because the print function adds a new line at the end of each line by default before we move on i'll add the syntax of the for loop here so that it's easier for me to explain it to you for each item in sequence execute the body of the loop before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below now let's talk about looping through a list suppose we have a list of languages like this let's use the for loop to iterate through each item of this list one by one just like we did in the strings example i'll say for language in languages print language now when i press run as you can see all three languages are printed one by one let me read out this code in plain english for each language in the languages list store that language in the language variable and print it now let's move on to python range function if you watch the last video of the while loop we used it to repeat a block of code a certain number of times like 5 times and 10 times let me give you an example i'll create a while loop that iterates five times from count equal to one to count equal to five i'll remove the old code and i'll say count equals one and then i'll say while count less than equals 5 print count and then i'll increase the value of count like count equals count plus 1 i'll press run and as expected the numbers from 1 to 5 are printed there's an easier way to write the same program using the for loop for that we'll use the range function let me give you an example i'll comment out this old code and then i'll say for count in range 1 to 6 print count this range function creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 it doesn't include the last value 6 let me run this code and as expected it prints 1 to 5. range is a very useful function we will learn more about the range function in detail in a future video so be sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon so that you don't miss that video let's try one more example of the for loop we will print a multiplication table of a number entered by the user from 1 to 10. let's first take input from the user so i'll say number equals integer input enter and integer since we want to print the multiplication table from 1 to 10 i will create a loop that iterates 10 times from count equal 1 to 10 so here i'll say for count in range 1 comma 11. as we have discussed before 11 will be excluded and this will give me a sequence from 1 to 10. now we need to find the product by multiplying number by count inside the body of the loop so here i'll say product equals number times count now let me use the print function with commas to format the output nicely so i'll say print number comma x or times count equals product when i run it it asks me to enter a number and i'll say something like 9 and when i press enter as you can see the multiplication table is printed in this nice format here count is increased from 1 to 10 and we have calculated the product by multiplying number and count so in the first iteration product will be 9 times 1 which is 9 in the second iteration product will be 9 times 2 and so on before we end this video here's a programming task for you can you create a program to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 basically the result should be equal to result equals 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus blah blah blah plus 100 if you're a programming beginner you might find this program a touch harder give it a try you can always find the answer to this program in our github repository if you get stuck i will provide the link in the description below before we end this video let me recap the concept that we have learnt loops are used in programming to repeat a block of code a for loop is used to iterate through items of a sequence if you know that a loop needs to run for a certain number of times like 5 times or 10 times it is better to use the for loop instead of the while loop range is a useful function that creates a sequence of numbers it's common to use range in a for loop to iterate the loop a certain number of times that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i provided the link in the description below feel free to copy the programs and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use
