what's up guys i'm puneet from programmers and welcome back to this series on python in this video we will learn about the range function which creates a sequence of numbers it is commonly used in for loops to run the loop a certain number of times let's get started suppose we want a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 to get the sequence we can use the range function like this so i can say result equals range 1 comma 11 here the start of the sequence is inclusive but the end is exclusive that's why it gives us a sequence from 1 up to 10 and not 1 up to 11 let me print the result so i'll say print result and when i press run instead of getting the result the sequence 1 to 10 i get range 1 11 which is basically the same thing i have typed here so what's happening well the range function returns a range object which is a sequence of characters we can see what's inside this object by converting it to a some other type like a list so here i'll convert the result to a list like this by using the list function and now when i press run then i get the sequence i was asking for that is 1 to 10. one thing to notice here is that by default the step between the numbers one two three four five and up to ten is one we can change this step as you will see later in this video before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below since range generates a sequence of numbers it is commonly used in for loops to iterate the loop a certain number of times let me give you an example so here i'll remove this old code and i'll say for value in range 1 comma 6 and then i'll say print value iteration here this range gives us a sequence from 1 which is included to 5 because 6 is not included now when i press run then it says 1 iteration 2 iteration it goes up to 5 as we can see the loop iterates 5 times from value equal to 1 to value equals 5. in our examples up to now we have passed two parameters to the range function start which is the start of the sequence and stop at which the sequence stops it's also possible to use range without passing the start parameter if the start parameter is not passed 0 is used as the default value let me give you an example so here i'll say result equals range 11 and then i'll say print list result now when i press run then it gives me a value from 0 to 10 because it's the same as saying give me a range from 0 to 11 and when i press run it essentially gives me the same result this makes it even easier to use range function in a for loop suppose i want to iterate a loop five times i can simply pass five to the range function like this so i'll remove this whole code and i'll say for value in range five and print value this loop iterates five times from the value zero to the value equals four when i press run then you can see it says zero to four if you have noticed in our examples the gap between two consecutive numbers is one let me show you again so i'll remove this old code and i'll say result equals list range 1 11 and when i print this as expected it says 1 to 10 as we can see the difference between the numbers is one this is because by default step of one is used this code is equivalent to adding one as the third parameter which is the step that we want to use this range function basically means start from this number go up to this number not including it and use 1 as the stepping number let me change the step to 3 and see what happens so here i'll replace this one with 3 and when i press run then this time the difference between two consecutive items of this sequence is 3 we can also use negative numbers in the range function like this so i'll remove this old code and i'll say result equals list range 5 to minus 6 and the step will be 1 now when i print the result and press run then you can see that it started from the number 5 it went up to minus 6 but not including 6 and the difference between two consecutive list items is 1 by the way range only works for integers we cannot use floating point numbers inside the range function at this point we have covered all the basics of python's range function before we end this video here's a task for you can you create a list like this using the range function i'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video here as always you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository i'll also include this link in the description below now here's a recap of what we learned in this video the range type is used to create a sequence of numbers range is commonly used in for loops to iterate the loop a certain number of times we cannot use floating point numbers inside range that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i've provided the link in the description below feel free to copy the program and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below in the next video we will learn about object oriented programming in python join me in this video series and let's
