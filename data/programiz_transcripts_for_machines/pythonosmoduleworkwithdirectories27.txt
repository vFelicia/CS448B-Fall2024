a folder or directory is a location on a computer to store and organize multiple files and sub directories python has a module named os that makes it really easy to work with directories and file management tasks in this video we will learn to use the os module to perform various directory operations like creating renaming and removing directories with the help of examples so let's get started before we learn to work with directories let's see how we can get the path to the current directory first for that we use the get cwd function of the os module it returns the current working directory as a string i'll go to my text editor first i need to import the os module so i'll say import os then i can say current underscore dir or current directory equals os dot get cwd and now let me print this variable print current underscore dir i'll save this file run the code say python main.pi and when i press enter then you can see that it printed the location of the main.pi file or the current directory in python we can change the current working directory by using the chdir method of the os module as we saw in our previous section the present working directory is the directory containing our python file by default let's change the current working directory i'll start with the old code and i'll say os dot ch dir and inside these quotation marks let me put this location and then instead of os i'll say exceptions which is the location of the file from the previous video so here i'm trying to change the default location and then let me print os dot get cwd again to confirm that the current working directory has been changed so let me run python main dot pi as you can see os dot get cwd first gave me the os folder where main dot pi was located when i change the default directory by using os.csdir then when i call os.getcwd again this time i get the new directory which i had set as the default directory here now if i create a file inside the current directory our file will be created inside this exceptions folder and not this os folder let me show this in action so here i'll write to a new file i'll say with open test dot txt i'll do that in write mode and i'll call the file point f then i'll say f dot write this is a test file now when i press run python main.pi a new file has been created and this file if i check here then you can't see that file in the os directory instead if i go to the exceptions directory you can see that test.txt file has been created and inside it you can see that this is a test file is there that means python is considering the exceptions directory to be the current directory for opening file test.txt in write mode in python all files and subdirectories inside a directory can be retrieved using the list dir function of the os module and i'll say print os dot list dir and let me run this so i say python main dot pi and you can see a list of all the files and folders inside this python videos directory can be seen here i can also pass an optional path argument to hdir to return files and subdirectories from a specific path so here i can say exceptions and if i run this program again then you can see the files that are inside the exceptions directory by the way if you're finding this video useful a sub to the channel would be awesome before moving to the next section of the video the programming team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easier to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description we can create a new directory using the mkdir function of the os module in my code editor i'll say os dot mkdir test and i can run this code so i'll say python main dot pi and if i go into the folder i can see that there's a new folder called test if i wanted this text directory to be created in a specific path i can use the full path location like this so here i'll say mkdir exceptions slash test and now let me run this so python main dot pi and if i go inside the exceptions folder then you can see that there's a test folder inside the exceptions folder we can rename any directory or file using the rename function of the os module let me show you how os dot rename and inside this let me pick any file so or folder i'll call idler name test so here i'll say test and i can say test new and now if i run this if i run this code so i'll say python mean dot pi then if i go back to my folder structure you can see that test has been renamed to test new as you just saw the rename method takes two arguments the current name of the folder or file and the new name of the folder or file the rename function can also be used to rename a file with the same exact syntax i encourage you to change the name of a file on your own and let me know if it worked in the comments section we can remove a file using the remove function of the os module so i'll go to my folder list and i can see that there's an exceptions4k.mov file here i'll remove it using python so on my code editor i'll say print first let me start by listing all the files and directories in this folder and here i'll say python main dot pi as you can see there is a file called python module let's remove this one so i want to remove python modules.mov next i'll say os dot remove python modules dot mov and then let me again print os dot list dir just to make sure that python modules has indeed been removed so now i'll say python main dot pi and as you can see python modules is not here python modules dot mov is not here anymore to remove a directory we use the rmdir function one thing we need to remember when removing a directory is that the directory must be empty otherwise an exception will be raised now we currently already have an empty directory called test new in our current directory which we have created before to remove this directory i will change my previous code and here i'll say os dot rmdir and here i'll say test new now let me run this first let me clear the screen here i'll say python main dot pi and now you can see that test new is here before but it's not in the new list or i can also verify this visually so you can see that test new folder is no longer there that means it has been removed that's it for this video if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository i'll also put this link in the video description and if you like this
