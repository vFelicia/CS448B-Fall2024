a full stack developer is not some gift from god or something that you know is is like very advanced it's just someone who can dabble a little bit in everything meaning they can write back encode in a language like python or node or you know node that means javascript or csharp whatever but they can also do a bit of frontend but don't try to you know be too hard on yourself if you struggle a little bit with the backend or frontend or or our prefer one because we do need specialized skill in some skills but now what's changed in from the last two years or last five years i should say is um you need to dabble in everything you can't be just a php developer without knowing javascript at all or you can't be a frontend developer with no understanding of how backend apis work you know so there's a lot of integration going on and you need to have a little knowledge of everything and if you do then you're a full stack developer
