what's up guys i'm punit from programmers and welcome back to this series on python in the last two videos we learned how to repeat a block of code using loops the while loop repeats a block of code until the specified test condition is false and the for loop repeats a block of code until the last item in a sequence is reached sometimes we may need to end the loop without checking the test condition or skip execution of code inside the loop in such cases break and continue statements are used let's start with the break statement first i'll create a loop to print numbers from 1 to 5 to get started so i'll say 4 item in range 1 to 6 and i'll print item and as you can see when i press run then 1 to 5 is printed now let me add a break statement here this time when i press run then only one is printed let's try to figure out what's happening here in the first iteration the item value is one one is printed and then the break statement is encountered as soon as we encounter the break statement we exit the loop now let me try something interesting i'll move this break statement before the print statement and this time when i press run absolutely nothing gets printed because the loop never reaches this print item statement the break statements are almost always used inside decision making statements like if and else because most of the time we may want to end the loop only when a certain condition is met let me show you this with a practical example i'll remove this code and i'll say if item equals equals 3 then break otherwise print item and i also want to see find out when the loop is execute exited so i'll print outside the loop the end here we have a condition to break this loop when item is equal to 3 now when the item becomes 3 the if condition is true and the break statement terminates the loop that's why 3 4 and 5 will not be printed this time let me run this code to show you this so when i run this code then 1 and 2 are printed and the end is printed let's create one more example of the break statement we will use a while loop to take a number input from the user if the user enters a positive number or zero we will print the number and again take another numeric input however if the user enters a negative number we will use the break statement and end the loop to approach this program first we will create a while loop with a test condition that's always true inside the loop we will take input from the user so i'll remove this old code and i'll say while true and i'll say number equals float input enter a number now this is an infinite while loop the only way to end this loop is by using the break statement now let's write our condition to print the number if it is positive and break the loop if it's negative so here i'll say if number less than 0 then break otherwise print u entered and here i'll print the number when i run this program then it says enter a number let me enter a positive number like 4 and it says you entered 4.0 and let me enter another positive number 67 it says you entered 67 now let me try entering a number that's negative so i'll say minus 9 and when i press enter then it exited me from the loop and the program as well before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below let's talk about the continue statement in python now the continue statement in python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for that iteration the loop will not terminate but continues on with the next iteration let me explain this with the help of an example so i'll remove this old code and i'll say 4i in range 5 and then i'll say number equals float input enter a number then i'll print the number this program asked me for five numbers so i'll say 1 2 54 34 minus 76 and something like 67 then it exited after five iterations what if you only want to print the positive numbers entered by the user and skip the printing of the negative numbers in such cases we can use the continue statement to skip code inside the loop if the user enters a negative number so here i'll add the continue statement like this i'll add the condition to check if the number is negative and continue the program without printing here so i'll say if number less than 0 continue this time when i run the program then it asks me for an input i'll say 34 it asks me for another input i'll say 56.5 or 7 and it prints the number and now if i enter a number like negative number like minus 87 then it does not print the number it asks me for another number immediately this is because when this condition is true the continue statement takes me to the next iteration of the loop let me continue adding positive numbers so i'll say 23 and then i'll add another negative number like minus 54 and as you can see this whole loop still executed for five times but depending on whether i input a negative number or the positive number i was able to use the continue statement to either print the number or go directly to the next iteration before we end this video here's a little programming task for you suppose we have a list like this can you create a program so that all items of the languages list are printed except swift and cplus plus you can find the answer to this question in our github repository also visit our website programmings.com for more tutorials and examples i've posted the link to both the github repository and our website in the description below let's recap the concepts we learnt in this video the break statement terminates the loop immediately when it is encountered the continue statement skips the code after it when it is encountered most of the time we want to change the way loops work only when a certain condition is met that's why we usually use break and continue inside the decision making statements like if and else that's it for this video i hope you learned something if you're just watching the video without writing any code i highly encourage you to try the programs in this video on your own the only way you can be a good programmer is by trying by the way you can find all the programs from this video on github i provided the link in the description below feel free to copy the program and edit them as you please and if you have any questions and feedback use the comment section below in the next video we will learn about the past statement join me in this video series and let's explore the exciting world of
