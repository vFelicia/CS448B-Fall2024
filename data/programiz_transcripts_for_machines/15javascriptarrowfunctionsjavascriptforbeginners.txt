what's up guys i'm punishment programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about arrow functions and how we can use them in javascript so let's get started in 2015 a new version of javascript called es6 was launched it introduced a new way of creating a function called arrow functions now arrow functions allow us to create functions in a much cleaner way compared to the regular functions we learned in the last video before we learned about arrow function let's write a regular javascript function first so i'll create a function called greet and the greet function will not do much it will just say good morning now let me call the function greet and when i press run as expected it prints out good morning to the console now let's see how we can perform the same task using an arrow function i'll start by commenting out these three lines so i'm getting lazy and not using any shortcuts and now let me write my arrow function so arrow function starts with parentheses followed by an arrow the arrow is equals to followed by greater than sign and i can write the body of the state function so console.log good morning and now this is my arrow function you must have noticed that the function keyword is not used to create an arrow function instead the parenthesis and the arrow together signify that this is an arrow function now we didn't give any name to our arrow function that's why we need to assign it to a variable so i'll create a variable name greet and assign this arrow function to the variable greet now greet is a function so i can call it like a regular function and when i press run you can see that i got the same output as before now let's compare the arrow function with the regular function you can see in the diagram that the arrow function makes our code shorter and cleaner also like a regular function an arrow function might have multiple statements inside it in such cases we can use curly braces let me show you so on the same code i will put curly braces and let me put another line console.log how are you let me also put a full stop here and because we have used multiple lines i have enclosed everything in curly braces now i'll press run and you can see that both of these lines were printed if you're enjoying this video please also check out program is pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount we can also create an arrow function with parameters let me show you i'll create an arrow function that takes two parameters a and b and adds them so i'll remove this old code and just let me say const add numbers equals inside the parenthesis a comma b and my muscle memory is acting up so it says arrow and ins i don't i just need one line so i'll just say console log i don't need the curly braces so a plus b i'm being really lazy here now we can call this function by passing two argument values so i will pass add numbers and then for a i'll pass five and for b i'll pass something like 9 let me press run and you can see that 14 which is the sum of 5 and 9 was printed to the screen now there's a strange thing about arrow functions that if it has only one parameter we can omit the parentheses altogether let me show you so i'll remove this old code and i'll create a function called square that will square any number so const square equals to a and then i can say console.log a raised to the power of 2. if you didn't know double star in javascript means raised to the power of so let me call square on a number called 5 my favorite number and when i press it on you can see that my program works it gives me the square of 5 which is 25 and you can see that i have not added any parenthesis here okay guys we need your support to keep these kinds of content free for all users youtube really likes engagement on

courses in our early example of adding numbers we have used the arrow function to add two numbers and print the result now similar to our normal function we can also return values from an arrow function and use it somewhere else in our program let's see an example i'll use this previous code to add numbers now instead of printing the result i will return the result so let me add let me remove this console.log result and say return result here return result is a return statement that is used to return the value that's stored in the result variable from the function since the function is returning some value this return value needs to be stored somewhere so during the function call i will assign the return value to a variable say output so i can say const output equals add numbers 5 comma 9 now let me print the sum so i'll say console.log the sum is and my variable output and now when i press run you can see i get the sum is 14. that means i was able to successfully return a result from the function stored it store it in a variable and print it in a userfriendly way since an error function is just another way to create a function the return statement immediately terminates it as well let's verify this by adding a print statement after the return statement so here i'll say console.log hey i'm here and when i press run you can see that there's no trace of this hey i'm here because as soon as we saw return the function exits immediately now to practice what we've learned here's a programming task for you can you create a program using an arrow function to check if the number entered by the user is a prime number or not this function should compute the result and return it to the function call and the result should be printed from outside the function take the input from the user create a function called is prime that accepts this number as input inside the function create a for loop that goes from 2 to number 1 that means if the user enters 10 then the loop should go from 2 to 9. now if the number that the user entered is divisible by any of these numbers from 2 to 9 then the function should return false otherwise it should return true now display a message that tells the user whether the number they entered is prime or not outside of the function you'll find the answer to this question in our github repository also if you want to revise these concepts you can find all these programs in our github repository as well i'll put the link in the video description below now that we've reached the end of this video it's time for programming squares what's the correct way to call this arrow function that you see on your screen you can also see the options on the screen and i hope you'll be able to answer the question in the comments happy programming you
