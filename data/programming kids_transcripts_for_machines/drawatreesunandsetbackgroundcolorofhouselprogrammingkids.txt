hello everyone welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video we will be completing the look of our house from our last video so in today's video we will be creating our house to look a little bit cooler just maybe change the background color and add a little sun and also draw a little tree so i'm really excited for this and i hope you guys are so unfortunately we will not be showing the code from for the house you're going to have to click that link in the description box to go through our last video well let's start i'm going to be opening idle okay and oh let me close this first because if you don't close the file that you have that are open already it will never open all right and as you can see my house program found last week is here you should definitely go check out that video and now we're going to be creating a new file by pressing file you file just like that and i'm going to be pasting the code for the house okay so i'm just gonna paste it okay on my new file here so here's everything that i need for the house so that i can complete the new uh the complete look for that okay so we will be starting off with this korean background color and in order to do that all we have to do is um use the screen is equal to turtle dot screen parenthesis command so first i'm just going to name this for y'all just so you won't get confused all right so screen is equal to journal dot screen and don't forget to include the parentheses just so you won't get an error let me put here some space all right and now we're going to be choosing our color so it's korean dot bg color and parenthesis code creation marks and the color so you can use blue if you want but to me i feel like blue is way too dark so i like to use sky blue and thankfully python understand what does sky blue mean and they will hopefully respond all right now we will be um creating the tree base for our tree so i'm just gonna name this again and let's turn it i'm going to make my turtle get her pen ready get ready for drawing and put her pen up so usually the pen app goes to and pan down they don't draw anything it's just for us to tell python that here i don't want to draw anything i just want to move to specific place okay so first we will type pen up retelling python that i don't want you to draw anything over here i want you to go to a specific place okay so to go to so i want them to go to the 250 it's somewhere around the screen so if you went to a specific place you might have to try it several times to find the place that you like and it's probably based on the accesses and the yaxis but you don't have to worry about them just find the place where you think the turtle or the sun would look i mean the tree or the sun will look good all right and i'm gonna tell python to put her pen or my turtle temperature pan down and you can start actually drawing from now on okay so we will choose a color that so that the tree base can be in and i was thinking of brown is probably most the most realistic color so fill color and brown and here we go include your creations your brackets and let's press enter and now i'm going to tell my turtle to begin filling whatever i draw from now on so t dot begin underscore fill and my brackets now i'm going to be moving backwards and putting in some angles so these can probably change depending on what length you want and what size or what angle but i'm going to be importing mine and finishing up i'm going to be ending with a tdot and fall telling python or turtle that over here i'm done filling whatever i had to fill and now i want you to stop it and yeah we are done with the tree base so let's now start the tree top and the tree top will be like two triangles so we're gonna have to create that again i'm gonna name this as hashtag treetop all right space okay so we we i'm going to be telling python to put or my turtle to put your pen up and stop um stop drawing for now just move where i want you to be exactly like we did over here in the top so t dot pen up and put in my parentheses and then t dot go to 250 and minus 30. all right press enter and t dot pan down all right so now we're going to be choosing our color that we think would be the most realistic so you can go ahead and to choose any color that you love but i think for me i would want to go to a light green color i think that would look pretty fresh and nice so let's type it up fill color open up the brackets include the quotation marks and type light green and close okay we will be pressing enter and telling python to begin filling whatever we want so from now on python will be filling everything we draw all right so now i want to choose an angle perhaps 90 degrees would be good and move backwards and more angles i'm just going to go ahead and type them again you can be free to change them to something that you like or you prefer like the length and how big you want it to be in the directions in the angle size but this is what i'm doing all right finishing up i'm going to be and the fill meaning that i don't want nature to fill any more shapes here we go and enter so and now we will be filling in a white color and going over the tri that this triangle and the reason is if you don't do the following you will be getting a mix between the the color and it won't be colored properly so make sure to do this it's really important that you do or else you won't get a beautiful tree it will be the colors won't be clear and there would be like space where it's white or blue or whatever the background is so let's do this so dot fill color so you just have to use white all right we will also type in begin fill to just tell python that i want them to fill up now and i'm going to be moving forward 55 steps sorry i'm going to be for moving forward 90 steps and the angle should be 55. go left and 55 all right press enter and i'm going to end fill right now no more filling for me so now we have one triangle done and maybe if we make another one it should be looking better better than one triangle only so that's exactly what we will be doing i'm going to choose the color again and i'm going to be making it light green exactly like the first one right and i'm going to be beginning fill include the parentheses and press enter and just going to move backwards and forwards different steps and angles and lastly and underscore fill all right that was pretty easy now we're going to be drawing the sun and it's actually pretty simple we're just going to have to draw a circle with a specific radius and whatever color that we want so i'm just going to put the pen up again so that we can move freely without drawing anything so see that pen up and put in the brackets parentheses and i'm going to be typing t dot go to 150 250 again this is based on the axes and you can personally put it anywhere that you want anyway that you think looks good in and now we're going to be choosing the color so i think i would go with i want to go with orange because our my house is brown brown shade so i think orange will give a good pop and a good look okay so t dot felt color and orange parentheses ink um quotation marks okay here we go press enter and pan down telling python that from now on you can draw whatever you want whatever the code sell you okay let's begin phil first of all if you want to learn more about chips and python and intros animations make sure to check out our three intros to animations there are really easy steps and tutorials just for you guys i will be linking them in the description box down below all right now we will be typing to that circle and we will be giving our circle a radius so that python draws whatever we want so i'm going with 24. and i'm going to be ending file over here and on your score fill and include the brackets wow this looks pretty good to me let's uh save this so i'm going to save it next to the first one on my desktop and i'll save it as my house who knows maybe this can be my house in the future okay now that it's saved over here we're going to be running this so let's run all right so let's run press run and run module one two three the house is perfect the color is amazing and the tree is perfectly standing and the sun is shining isn't that cool guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video and had fun creating this as much as i did make sure to um check the description box to view all of our videos and check out our channel and check all the awesome videos that we do so keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids
