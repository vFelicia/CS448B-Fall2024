hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is Lin and in today's video I'll be teaching you everything you have to know about variables in Python make sure to grab a notebook to take notes or a cup of tea and let's get started okay so first of all let's just clear out what does very well mean variable is a memory location that is used to store data values and the unique thing about Python is that it doesn't have a command for declaring variable it just creates a variable the second you enter a value in we'll talk more about this later on the video so now let's talk about types of variables variables might also be known as data types so okay here we go first of all data types are used to present a value that's although what a poetry can be performed in some kind of dare and types are numbers drinks lists tuples and dictionary so let's start we're gonna explain each one but before let's just go through the rules for naming the variables unfortunately you cannot name the variable whatever you want there is some rule that you have to follow first of all your variables cannot start with an with a number you can do an underscore a letter if you want though and notice that the Python is case sensitive so bully with a cap with an uppercase B at the beginning is different from boy with a lowercase B so if you try and turn the variable on them pressing enter and you regret with your roach and you want to delete it you'll often find Python not responding to you that's where dull funk should come in if you want to delete any variable that you should be using good cell function and if you want to add a variable you should use that append function so how are variables formed well variables are formed when you when some when you assign a value to them for instance if you have a test and you had a math test and you wanted to record all of your tests on Python so you make like a program on your phone to check all of your exams and say there's a friend's or something like that you will have to put a value for each test so if you got 57 on your first exam then you should then the value of the first variable which is test one is 57 while the value for test 3 is 96 and you can see how you have improved so what are numbers numbers are used to store numeric values in Python and we have a lot of types of numbers when we have int known as integer then we have long integer floats and complex numbers okay so what are int int as we sent our integers there are usually positive or negative and they have no decimal point but if they should also be a whole number what our long integers so long integers are very long and they are usually unlimited they are infinite and usually you would use the L the letter L to tell Python a long number and now we're going to be talking about floats floats are real numbers represented with a decimal point dividing the integer and the fractional part and sometimes you would have to write fluids using the scientific notation so for example if you want to write six point seven times ten to the power of five in Python what you have to do is replace the 10 with an e and this is how Python will get it that you are trying to tell Python that you are entering the fluid using the scientific notation now let's talk about complex numbers complex the builtin function that returns a complex number with real and imaginary values it is usually used to convert a string or a number into a complex one so here are a few examples of each that we just learned right now so here we have integers you can see positive 10 positive 100 if you don't see a plus sign that means it's positive well if you see a negative sign then it's negative so we have minus 786 positive 0 8 0 or positive 80 negative 0 4 9 0 and so on you can even add a letter like x over here then for long variables we have blang very long numbers letter L notice even here so here we have an upper tier L and here we have a lower key L it's your choice you can put whichever you need and then we have to the floats we have decimal points and negative positive here we have a notation and next to have complex more letters you can see they're kind of complicated letters in between negative sign decimals and let's move on now we will be talking about strings strings are Aries easily like let's explain that string is a word or sentence they are usually enclosed by double or single Cartesians if you want to know more about double and single quotations and placeholder then make sure to check out our last video where we showed you how to use the double and single could scopes I'll link that in the description box but sometimes you would often find to find people using triple codes and the reason is that when a string has many single codes or double codes the string extends over a multiple line as difficult so you'll have to use them okay so lists are variables that can hold a number of string in an organized set and fortunately there's also rules for lessons but they are really easy usually lists are written using square brackets and they contain a list of values obviously you can always change the size of the value which is a good thing and individual items are fruits too using the index number now let's talk a little bit about tuples tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable written using round brackets called the parentheses and a tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas unlike lists so there are also rules for tuples you always enclose the tuples in parentheses if you don't know what parentheses are they're around kind of brackets they're also mentioned here and tuples usually contain a fixed list of values and they cannot be changed so size and values cannot be changed and Seema's lisps individual items are referred to using that index number so the difference between tuples and lists the main difference is that lists are enclosed in square brackets and their element and size can be changed while tuples are enclosed in parentheses and they have circled type of or curved type of brackets and they cannot be updated cannot be changed okay so let's talk a little bit more about dictionaries a dictionary is a collection which is unordered changeable and indexed so the difference between lists and dictionaries is that a list is an ordered sequence of objects where dictionaries are unordered and they're all over the place alright guys I hope this video was easier for you I think by the end of this by the end of this video you have understand what is all of these variables and I hope you guys enjoyed it and learn something you make sure to LIKE this video if you did and subscribe to our channel to become one of the members of our family and to
