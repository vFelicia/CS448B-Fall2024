hello everyone i'm sarah and welcome to programming kids in today's video i'll be teaching you how to do how to draw a triangle hexagon and start so what are you waiting for grab your notebook or a cup of tea and let's get started so first you have to search for idle python and to say right now we will be opening new file by pressing file new file like so so first i'm going to show you how to draw a hexagon so first you have to type import detail so it's our program so program is to draw graphics enter and then we're going to name we're going to name our tutor i'm giving it as t equal to g2 here you can name your twitter any name you want enter and right now we're gonna type t dot fell color so it means which color you want your hexagon to be red pink green i want my hexagon to be green color so i'm gonna type green and enter and right now you're going to type t dot begin underscore fell underscore fail that means for the twitter to start coloring right now enter and right now we're going to type 4 x and range and sex so it means the size of the tree tell empty and right now we're gonna type t dot forward forward oh sorry for words with 78 so it means for the tutor to move forward 78 steps enter and then we're gonna type t dot right illustrate minus 60 settings for the tutor to write minus 60 steps okay so right now we're going to type here we're gonna we're gonna instance we're gonna type t dot and underscore fell right now we're gonna save it as so file save as so i'm gonna save it as hexagon entry okay and right now we're gonna run module wow that's so amazing but so clever right now we're gonna exit and i'm gonna show you how to draw a star so accept so right now let's just search again for i so for bython and right now we will be opening new file by pressing file new file like so so right now i'm going to show you how to draw a star so first you have to type import title as we said it's a it's a program used to draw graphics and two and right now we can name our article i'm going to name it as c equal to you can name it any name you want enter and right now i'm going to type 4x and range for x in range five entry and also i forgot you to add these and three and right now we're gonna type t dot forwards 150 so it means for the tutor to move forward 150 steps enter and right now we're going to have t we're going to type t dot right zero try minus 16 oh i mean 144 okay and right now we're gonna save it as so i'm gonna save that star okay and right now we're gonna run module wow that's so amazing this is a star it's so nice okay now we're gonna exit another time and right now i'm going to show you how to draw a triangle and check right now we will be opening new file by pressing file new file like so so first you have to type import treat it as we said it's a programming usage of graphics and here and right now we can name our twitter t equal to and right now we're gonna type the dot fill color that fill color so i want that i want the rectangle to be i mean i want the triangle to be blue color so i'm gonna type blue color you can type pink if you want any color you want enter and right now we're going to type t dot begin underscore fell that means for your reason start coloring right now and two and right now we're gonna type four x and range and three and so this is the size of the turtle entry and right now we're gonna type t.4 with oh sorry for wait i forgot to add the a t dot forward ft sex that means for the tutor to move forward 56 steps and right now we're gonna type t dot try minus 120 so three the detail to move right to move right minus steps and two right now we're gonna type here we're gonna type t dot and underscore pell so we're done right now we're gonna save it as file save as so i'm gonna save it as triangle entry and right now we're gonna run module are you ready guys run module wow that is so amazing look at the triangle it's so nice i hope you learned guys something in you make sure to like subscribe and hit the notification bell and to get notified every time we upload a new video and i hope you learned something new and thank you for watching see you next time bye for now i
