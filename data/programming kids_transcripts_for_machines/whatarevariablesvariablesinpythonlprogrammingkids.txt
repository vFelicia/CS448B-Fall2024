hello programmers welcome or welcome back to programming kids my name is lynn and today we are going to learn about variables variables are used to store information in but in order to name something you have to follow some rules one it's gonna start with number two it should have no spaces you can use an under score instead three it should not include any symbols such as these four it should contain lowercase letters five it cannot be a data type example string tuple or whatever because for example if you use tuple is equal to subscribe it will give you an error because data types cannot be used as variables python uses dynamic typing meaning you can reassign variables to this to different data types this makes python very flexible in assigning data types and it differs from other languages that are statically typed now there are pros and cons of dynamic typing the pros is that it's very easy to work with and it's it's a faster development time it will be less time consuming for you the cons of dynamic typing is that it may result in unexpected bugs and you need to be aware of the type now in order to assign variables you need to use a single equal sign which is an assignment operator further on the video we're going to use the type function which will give you the ability to see what data type this variable is so what are we waiting for let's explore these concepts on our jupiter notebook so here i am on my jupiter notebook and we are going to start using our variable concepts that we learned so for example let me assign a as a number what do you guys think a should be how about 10 so 10 so yeah i have a this is my variable and it's storing inside a 10. so let's run this and let's check what is a 10 how about wait i changed my mind i want to do a as 15 now let's try running 8 15. so basically i am reassigning and this is dynamic typing it's really flexible and it's really okay next we are going to try to do a plus oh sorry a plus a 30 you might be wondering what just happened well i said last time that a is 15 so what python did what added 15 plus 15 which is 30. let's try a times a 225 that was really quick and it's really smart how about a division sign what what will happen if i divide a by a let's see a divided by eight 1.0 that's correct hmm how about we try our oh let's try our percentage time which is our month we're gonna try that so let's see if there's any remainder than this zero remainders that is absolutely correct python is very smart now let's try to type a is equal to 0.5 and the strength is now let's check again perfect now i want to know what type is a like what's what's the type so let's do this and inside it i'll put the a and run it's a float in our last video we learned about all data types so this is right because it includes a decimal point now let's say i want to reassign it again and this time this is my value let's run it one two three okay but what's the type again check a it's integer correct let's try a is equal to subscribe with and brackets all right let's run a subscribe let's try check the type string that's right now that we have practiced naming our variables let me give you an exercise so i want to calculate my taxes like my total taxes per month so let's say my income is a hundred and my tax my tax is 0.1 basically ten percent so yeah and i want to find my total so how can i find my total if i have these two you're going to have to multiply my income by my tax so now let's see what's my total and it's 10.0 because what python did is multiply 100 by 0.1 you can also do this 100 multiplied by 0.1 is 10. meaning that python is correct so guys that's it for this video i hope you guys understood variables and their usage if you have any questions make sure to comment that down below and i'll be happy to answer you make sure to like and subscribe to join our family turn the notification bell to get notified every time we upload a new video keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
