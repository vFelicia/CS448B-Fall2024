hello everyone welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video we will be applying the math rules that we learned in our past video so in our last video we learned all the rules that you shouldn't apply and that you should apply on python so that you can easily make python do your math homework well python can be as fast as a calculator and they can give you the answer no matter how complex the question might be so let's open up idle all right so usually in our videos we open a new file but because you probably want the answer to come fast and you don't want to waste your time by opening a new file and running it you can just do it on the python shell over here okay so we are going to be going through plus minus multiplication division and the order of operation so let's start with the plus or addition so let's type as question and it can be really long it doesn't matter no matter how long it is python will still give you the answer so let me type one over here and then i i usually like to skip space between it just so that it looks neat you can do that too if you want all right so here we go i typed a long number and another long number here that i want python to add so usually in english we type equal or a question mark but unfortunately if you do that on python it will give you an error and let's try it just so that you guys can understand what do i mean by error whoops they gave me syntax error invalid syntax so even though in our english language we usually put an equal sign to make the question full and just understandable python their language is different and they don't understand what's an equal sign because we usually store variables using them nor a question mark let me just type another one and use a question mark and let's see if it will work and here whoops another syntax error and you can notice that python highlighted the question mark they don't understand what does that mean okay now let's try typing a question without including that equal sign or the question mark and let's press let's press enter okay i got my answer so you should always obey python just so that they can obey you with whatever you need let's move on to um subtraction or minusing so it's exactly the same nothing is different so let me type in a question and press minus okay so here's my question i am going to be pressing enter and got it okay so now what do you think happen if i make the small number minus the big number do you think i'll get a positive sign or a negative sign let's try it out all right here i have a question and we are going to be pressing enter right now i have 98 minus 5 6170 that's not possible right so they have to give us a negative sign let's see if python is smart python is indeed smart they give us minus five five eight zero so if we type this normally like five six seven eight minus 98 they give us a positive 5 5 8 year well now that we have gone through negative and positive or um plus and minus or addition and subtraction it's time for us to move to multiplication and division so let's start with multiplication for multiplication we use an asterisk as the multiplication sign which is this you have to hold on shift and eight and you'll get it okay so let me type in in question and use my a fix multiply by and press enter and here it is you get your answer let's try it again and press enter and here it is moving on to the division we have to use a backslash as our division sign so let's type in another question for python to solve and press enter and here it is so you can see that it's 5 51 point something that's because all of these numbers are remainders and if you try to do it on a calculator they probably give you the same thing now let's do something that might be divisible by another thing so how about 6 divided by 3 the answer is supposed to be 2. let's see if python will give us the answer python gave us 2.0 so they they just want to clear out that there are no remainders and this is why they add zero okay now let's move on to the order of operation so let me type in a question and let's see how can we solve it there might be a way to solving it in two ways so let me just type it in first okay here's my question five minus three plus seven so if you do it normally starting from the side and do five minus three you get two and plus seven is nine but if you want to start this by using um solving these two first it would be different so let's try by using three plus seven which is ten and then using 5 minus 10. that gives that a negative number so i am going to go ahead and just press enter right now and the answer is 9. what python did is the 53 first which is two and add is seven which is nine now what do you think will happen if i did this it might look the same and the only difference that i added a bracket but the answer would be completely different it's minus five because i told i added brackets python automatically notes notices that they should start by adding this and then using the extra information okay so whatever you see in brackets is the thing that happens first in python all right let's move on to using multiplication and addition or subtraction or division in a question let me type this okay so here's my question psi seven times nine plus five okay so seven times nine is 63 plus five is let's see what it is it's 68 okay so this is my answer now what do you think happens if i do five plus seven times eight or times nine sorry do you think the answer might change let's change it doesn't change because in the order of operation multiplication and division happens before subtraction and addition well i hope you get the hang of it you're going to have to understand it before actually putting it on python now let's move on to exponent and exponent it actually means to the power off so for exponent we use double asterisks which is the multiplication sign okay so this is when you use double asterisks or double multiplication sign it actually means exponent which is the power of oh sorry so if i type 4 and add 2 asterisks 4 to the power of 2 the answer is supposed to be 16. yup python is smart what i mean by 4 to the power of 2 is 4 times 4 which is 16. let me try a different big number so i'm probably not going to be able to do this in my brain but luckily python can help and i'm going to be doing it to the power of this now oh i don't know what happened they're giving me nothing it's probably because there's no more space to do it over here i'm not sure okay um plus the greater than signs are gone when i press enter they're not coming so let's open python again or let's just type three plus five here and let's see if this will work when there is no greater than signs nothing happens looks like there's an error in python well let me close this and open python again when you want to type a question do it greater than sign you'd always be aware okay now let's continue typing our question we were typing a massive number to the power off so double a streets and here whoa oh my gosh that is a massive number and i get why it wasn't breaking in the first place well let's try another number so i have 456 to the power off whoa this is going to be a lot looks like there's no more space again for this one question takes so much place let's open python again and let's type in a different question all right press enter oh my gosh it's squeezing text 456 lines that means that the questions is too big to be filled on the python child way too big oh my gosh well guys i hope you enjoyed this video because it's really fun to get your answer by just typing it don't you think here i got this because it's pretty small but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and have fun getting your math homework done well keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
