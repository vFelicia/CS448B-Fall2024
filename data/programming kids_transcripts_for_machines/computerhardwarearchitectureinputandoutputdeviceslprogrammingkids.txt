hello programmers welcome back to programming kids in today's video you'll be learning about hardware architecture the aim of this video is to give you a brief idea about parts for computer and their functions so what are we waiting for let's get started here's a fun fact mobile phones tablets laptops smart watches and televisions are all computers all right let's start with input and output devices an input simply is data that a computer receives an output is data that a computer sends examples for input devices camera keyboard controller mouse microphone and remote control examples for output devices speaker monitor headphones and here's printer interesting one alexa it's similar to zero on iphone devices we call their name and they respond alexa is both an input and output device because it has microphone and speaker a microphone is used to record what are we saying and a speaker to answer us now i will be showing you the computer's main components as a diagram this is how the arrangement of our computer is input devices processor and internal memory devices output devices and secondary storage devices alright so you might be wondering what is main memory and how does it differ from a secondary memory so let me explain main memory a main memory is a small temporary storage lost on reboot also known as ram secondary memory it is slow large permanent storage latched until deleted example disk drive or memory stick here's a fun fact the computer has a hardware called cpu central processing unit which runs programs they are always waiting for instructions and asking what's next anyways y'all that's it for today's video i really hope to learn something new make sure to like subscribe and turn the notification bell on to get notified every time we upload a new video keep programming and we'll see you all next time on programming kids bye for now
