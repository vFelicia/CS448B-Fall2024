hello programmers my name is lin and in today's video i will be teaching you about tuples and python by the end of this video you will understand the meaning of immutability you will understand the rules of tuples you will understand the difference between tuples and lists and the common things between them you will understand the whole point of tuples compared to lists and you will apply all of these concepts into the jupiter notebook as well as taking a mini quiz at the end to test your knowledge so what are tuples tuples are said to be immutable meaning they cannot be changed and they are always constant and you can use tuples to represent constant information for example the number of days in a week or the number of months in a year or etc the difference between tuples and lists now tuples and lisps are extremely similar however tuples are constant immutable and they cannot be changed and they use parentheses while lisps are there they can be changed in many ways such as by reassigning and they use square brackets if you don't know much about lisps make sure to check the video in the eye in the corner and i will be linking it in the description box in case next is the common things between lisps and tuples i'm just going to refresh your mind about them now they both use commas in order to separate objects and you can use variety of data types on both of them they both use the liane function which is used to count the number of items in the list or tuple and they both support indexing and slicing again if you don't know about indexing and slicing i will be linking a video in the i in the corner and in the description box now what's the whole point of tuples when you have lists and lists actually have even more methods way more methods compared to tuples well tuples aren't often used in programming but it's extremely important to use them when you need something to be immutable and it's constant that will never change so guys let's hop into our jupiter notebook and explore these concepts see you there all right guys here we are in our jupiter notebook now i'm going to be creating a tuple i'm going to call it t and i'm going to use parentheses and i'm going to make a tuple of integers but of course you can use any type of data type and you can even mix them together okay perfect now let's try it out all right perfect now um as i said before lists have way more special fun creative methods that you can use but here is one example that is used in tuples the first one or the one that we have is index and it's used to find the index of a number so what you have to do is the d dot index and parenthesis inside the parentheses you should put the value that you need so for example one the index of that is zero if you put two the index oh index of that is one and three two and so on okay now i'm going to be explaining about immutability furthermore so let's say the same list i have t if i want to add zero let's run it let's see what it gives us oh yeah this is the index again but if we say t.0 and we say equal to change because i'm adding change round it gives me error what about using the append function so in our last videos we learned that append is a function that is used to add an item to a list or to tuple or a dictionary or whatever so let's try it t dot append let's see if it works with tuples and i want to add one it gives me er and this is proof that two pools are immutable okay guys so that's all for the basics of tuples let's go back to our slides and we're going to test your knowledge by taking a mini quiz see you there okay programmers let's test your knowledge i will be giving you three questions and you should answer them the first question is compared to lisps tuples have way more methods associated with them is that true or false pause this video think about it and unpause it when you're ready and the correct answer is false as we said before tuples have less methods associated with them compared to lists okay question number two lists can change and you can reassign them while two poles are immutable and therefore can't be changed is that true or is that false pause this video think about it and unpause it when you're ready and the correct answer is true because as i said before two pulls are immutable and they are constant and last question which of the following is the tube you have some options so pause this video think about it and unpause it when you have the answer and the correct answer is this because we you should have parentheses from the beginning to the end so the first one is wrong the second one is wrong and the third and the third one is wrong because both square and parentheses are used so we're gonna go with the fourth one all right guys that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed it make sure to like subscribe and turn the notification ball on to get notified when we upload a new video keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
