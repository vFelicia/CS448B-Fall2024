hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video i'll be giving you guys an introduction to circles in python in our last videos we learned a lot about general information about programming language python variables facts and um we also learned how to draw plenty of graphics control link in the description box and now it's time for you guys to get ready for animations animation will probably have to be the best part about python creating your like a model or just drawing a girl or a panda or whatever you want can be the best part and the most fun part in order to do these you have to learn basic shapes like square circles triangles and more so in today's video as you guys might know we will be drawing circles and we will be going through three subheadings first a regular simple circle you will fill it with two of your favorite colors you will outline it with one and fill it with one then we will create a tangent circle and three we will create a spiral circle so what are you waiting for go grab a notebook or a cup of tea and let's get started first i will be opening idle by searching it on my pawley search i my role and press enter and it will automatically open then i'll be creating a new file by pressing file new file and here it is this is where i'll be doing my file program but first i have to name it just before i can identify easier so i'll name it as simple circle dot py because this is what our first program or code will be so we will be importing journal now importing turtle is just the main mini program in python for drawing right what is actually what actually happens is that when you import turtle python or idle opens the python launcher which is which just shows you the your code into real life so let's import it as you might tell nothing is happening and that's because we didn't run it if you do is on the python shell it might happen faster but on the uh the python file will help will just give you the flexibility to copy paste and do whatever you want on it okay now we will be naming our turtle if you want you can go ahead and name your your turtle anything but i will just stick with the t so t is equal to turtle dot and brackets oops okay and press enter if you try to run it right now you're going to have to save it and um i'll just save it on my desktop and i want to save it as circle and save and it saves over here so now that we pressed run it automatically runs it and this is turtle and if you guys want to this turtle to be an actual graphical turtle then make sure to comment that in the in the comment section and if you guys want to see it then i'll be happy to make it all you have to type is all you have to comment is make that video and i'll be happy to do that okay now we will uh get started with the coloring and the circle drawing and everything so first i just want to pick a color for my um circle so first i'll type t dot color and we will open the bracket to quotation marks and type your colors so i want python to um start like um i'm gonna choose two colors one is pink and the next one i want it to be like sky blue i think that would be really cool so i'll just type sky blue and let's see how smart is python do you think they'll get what is skype what does it mean or do you think they'll give us an error let's see anyways let's press enter and then we will have to just um choose a width for our circle so i was thinking of five you can try to make it as big as you want but i think five for me would be good so i'll just type 5 and press enter then we i want my channel now to begin coloring my circle so i'll do that i'll type t dot begin underscore fill and open the brackets then the reason that we put an underscore over here because beginfill is actually a variable and python does not understand i won't understand what what is it if you don't put an underscore if you want to know more about variables make sure to check our video which will be linked in the description box and now i want to type my radius so i was thinking maybe i could do a hundred maybe that would be good not too big not too small and we will end the fill over here because there is nothing more and underscore fill again is a variable and here we go now we're going to have to save it so file save and now we can run it here we go wow i love that color whoa isn't that really cool guys i really love how the blue color is actually sky blue this is how smart python is you can tell them the name of any color that you want and they'll make it for you how about we experiment a little bit more what if i want the width to be 50 this time and the circle um radius maybe like a 150 let's save and run save and run whoa that is so cool don't you think so this is really thick that reminds me of a donut if you make it maybe thicker it might look like a donut let's try so maybe make the width more like 150 no maybe 100 actually and save it and run let's see oh i love that pink color don't you think so wow isn't that cool okay now let's move on to our next heading which will be at tangent circle i'm really excited for this so i'm just gonna exit this and as you guys can see we can always come back to this because we saved it on our desktop you can open it and here it is and run it whenever you want time for us to move the next program our next program will be a change in circle so let's open idle again press enter and it will open and i will be creating a new file and i'll name it so i think i'll name it um justine dot py okay so hashtag tangent dot p y and then i'll import the turtle and press enter again and name my turtle so i'll just name it as t because i'm just used to that and type turtle dot turtle and just open up the brackets and press enter then i'll start my loop so i'll just type it in for x in range i want the range to be 10 and x is unknown okay and add the colon just so we inform python that this is over here this is a loop okay and i will be typing t dot circle this is how much how many times i want python to repeat this so 10 10 times x okay and let's close the brackets and here we go let's run it first we will save it and i'll just save it on my desktop just beside the first one add tangent save it as team and save and here it is okay let's run and let's see if this works whoa that is really cool there are multiple of circles forming each with a different radius python is really smart whoa this is pretty cool to me okay this was such an easy code for um the tangent community is probably one of my favorites it's short and it's easy and it's fun let's move on to the next and final program now it's time for us to do the final program which is pirate circle let's just search idle again and press enter will open and i'll have to create a new file and name it so i'll just name it spyro hashtag spyro and press dot py okay and we'll press enter and i'll import my journal and name it so i'll name it again to see it is equal to turtle dot turtle whoops oh what's wrong with me okay finally turn them properly right now and don't forget to put your bracket and press enter okay now we will have to create a loop again and this time 4x in range 100 so let's open a bracket and oh all right 100 and close put your um colons to tell python this is a loop and we will type t dot circle open the bracket i want to type how many times i want python to repeat so i wanted to repeat it 10 times so 10 plus this time so the plus sign plus x they will put a comma because now i have to choose my angle and i just want us to go for 45 i think 45 oh maybe maybe 65 that would be more interesting and let's press enter and nothing to fear off let's run this module but before we do that let's save it first now let's save it again on my desktop and just as spiral and save and let's run it the most interesting part it's drawing a circle a circle a circle that is really cool whoa i really love circles they make me dizzy but they're really fun wow isn't don't you think that's cool oh i'm getting dizzy whoa well guys circles are really fun and i'm pretty sure there will be more graphics coming up so if you want to see that make sure to subscribe and if you want to be one of the first people to see my videos then turn that notification bell on and like this video if you love circles and you love coding and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids keep programming bye
