hey there have you ever came across gigabyte and megabyte or even kilobyte and got confused well my name is lynn and in today's video we will be learning about units of measuring digital information like bit byte and megabyte and if you want to learn about data rates like megabytes per second then stay tuned for our next video anyways what are we waiting for let's get right into today's lesson digital information which is stored in storages like hard drives and usb memories are measured with units starting from bits bytes kilobyte and so on you might observe these measurement units on your computer while saving your homework as a word document a bit is a binary digit the smallest increment of data on a computer it is usually zero or one one byte consists of eight bits a character like letter or numeric such as a b or eight is stored as one byte for example letter a is stored on your pc as one byte that contains the bits zero one one four zero one so everything stored in our computer storages like pictures videos or music are encoded as bits remember one bit a01 and one byte is eight bits now let me give you an interesting example len my name starting it in a text file will occupy 3 bytes like so each letter contains 8 bits l i n really interesting right data can be measured using different measuring units examples are one kilo bit which is 1024 bit one megabit which is 1024 kilobits one gigabit which is 1024 megabits one terabit which is 1024 gigabit one zetabit which is 1024 terabit and yeah remember one byte is eight bits now you can convert from bet to byte in a really simple step which is by dividing one over eight so let me give you a few examples one kilobit divided by one over eight kilobyte will give you will give you 0.125 kilobytes all you have to do is divide by one over eight now one megabit can also be converted by dividing one over eight which will give us 0.125 megabytes really simple it's actually really fun to solve too but why do we have all of these measuring units suppose we have a folder which is 0.5 gigabytes this number might seem simple but if it was in bits or bytes the number would have been way more complex and more confusing so let me explain some more 0.5 gigabytes can be made bigger as in a bigger digit number by dividing by multiplying by 1024 megabytes which will give us 512 and again this number might can also be converted into an even bigger digit by multiplying by 1024 kilobyte which will give us 524 000 kilobytes which can also again be converted into an even bigger digit by multiplying by 1024 which will give us the answer in bytes so 536 million bytes also be converted again to bits lastly two bits so you get the answer 536 million bytes multiplied by eight will give us four trillion bits oh my god that's really big i'm really thankful that we have all of these other measurements which keep things simple anyways now we have a folder which is 10 trillion bits big this number is really complex and confusing let's see how can we make it smaller using the other measurements 10 trillion bits should be divided by 8 first so that you can get it the answer in bytes which is 1 trillion now we have to convert this to kilowatt in order to do that you have to divide 1 trillion bytes by 1024 which will give us 1 billion kilobyte let's convert this into megabyte and then gigabyte so 1 million kilobyte divided again by 1024 will give us 119 000 megabytes and lastly let's divide that one more time by 1024 which will finally give us 1.16 gigabyte really cool now abbreviations capital mb is abbreviation for megabyte small mb is abbreviation for megabit capital kb is abbreviation for kilobyte small kb is abbreviation 4 kilobit and so on so whenever you see capital b that means it's white and whenever you see small b that means it's bit all right guys i hope you enjoyed this video and was able to understand the lesson make sure to stay tuned for our part two of this video where we'll be talking about data rates which are used to measure speed of traffic like networks using megabytes per second and more if you guys have any questions make sure to comment it in the comment section and i will be happy to answer you and make sure to subscribe to join our family and give this video a big thumbs up to if you understood the lesson and keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
