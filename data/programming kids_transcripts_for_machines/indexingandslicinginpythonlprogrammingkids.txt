hello programmers welcome back to programming kids my name is sari and today we're gonna learn about string indexing and sizing so what are you waiting for let's get started so the first thing you have to do while is indexing and sizing indexing is when you grab a single character and sizing when you grab a subsection from that string so what are you waiting for just pop into our picture notebook and see some examples about strength indexing and slicing so i will search for the jupiter notebook enter that's the command line now to start coding we will press new button 3. here you can see the input function so let us start first by creating a string let us name it as my string is equal to let's say programming fibs run string now from the sentence programming kids if i want to grab a single character you will use indexing because indexing is when you grab a single character so let us say if i want to grab a we'll use indexing and what can you start counting with zero one two three etc so we have to count b to a starting with zero so zero one two three four five do you say my string brackets five you'll get a now if you want to grab another letter k so 0 1 two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven or so let's please count twelve so we will say my string brackets you will get k now there is two ways to get that same letter so let us just grab another letter let's say r so 0 1 2 3 okay my string brackets four we will get r to get that same letter we'll start counting with zero starting counting by negative number so you're saying negative one negative two and negative three negative four also the space count negative five negative six negative seven negative eight negative nine negative ten negative eleven and negative twelve the rest of negative 12 i will get the same letter r so that's it for indexing now let us see some examples about slicing so first let me create a string i'll name it as my string my string and i'll just add some random letters so these these are just some random letters okay so now if i run that that's it my string i will get these random letters so from these random letters if i want to grab sentences if i want to grab h q a we will use slicing so we will count from h to g so now here people will be confused we said that we want h q a why are we counting till g because invite means go up but don't include that number if you are going up by button won't include that number so we will save my strength brackets colon we will count from h to g so zero one two three so you will say three and you will get hq a the hqa now let us see if i want to grab l ok so we will say my string brackets calling l okay so zero one two three four five six from h to l six i'll write you six and then six seven eight nine means go up but don't take it with that number nine now if i run that i'll get l okay l okay now let us say if i want to grab c till h will say my string brackets so situate so you will say will count zero one two three four five six seven eight nine so you say here nine oops you say nine add the brackets yes now you will get c throw h so this is it for sizing so now let's just talk about the step size so let us say my string will get these random letters now what if i want to go as tip size by two what if i want to go from h to a to e to say my string and say calling colon if i want to do a slip size by two let's say coin colon two and it will go from h a e l c n we got a step size by two and you can say a step size by any number you like we can say three you will get a step size by three and also if you want the random lectures we'll say colin colon get all these random letters now what if i want to reverse what if i went to numbers from heat from h to h so i want the number starting from h e and x all the way to back to the c my string brackets call calling calling negative one randa i'll get this number back so that's it for today's video i hope you learned something new if you did please subscribe to join our family like and hit that notification bell on to get notified every time we upload a new video keep programming and i'll see you guys all next time on programming kids bye for now you
