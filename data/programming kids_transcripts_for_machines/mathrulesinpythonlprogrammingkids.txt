hey guys i'm sarah and welcome to programming kids and today's video i'll be teaching you matthews in python so what are you waiting for grab your notebook or a cup of tea and let's get into it so first you will be talking about the simple operator so in math is important in python operator we use the same addition sign or plus sign and also in subtraction we use the same minus sign or subtraction sign but in multiplication and math simple we use the multiplication samples and bison operator we use the star sign which is called the asterix and division and math simple we use the addition sign button bison operator to use the pack slash sign and for exponent and base symbol we use since the power of two and then by celebrate we use star star for parentheses we use the same parentheses an example for addition four plus two is equal to six an example for subtract subtraction four minus 2 is equal to 2 and example 4 multiplication 4 multiply by 2 is equal to 8 and an example for division 4 divided by 2 is equal to 2.0 example for 4 to the power of 2 is equal to 16 and an example for parentheses parenthesis four plus two parentheses multiplied by three is equal to eighteen order of operation multiplication and division comes before addition and subtraction so i'm going to give you an example what if we said to multiply by five plus five we said that multiplication and division comes before addition and subtraction so first we have to multiply and then we add so what does 2 multiply by 5 is equal to 10 and then 10 plus 5 is equal to 15 so the answer is 15. order of operation continued so multiplication and division have the same precedence subtraction and addition have the same precedence so it means that multiplication and division comes before subtraction and addition python calculates from the left one by one to the right so it means that python calculates from the left one way one to the right parentheses we can use parenthesis to control the order of operation we can put parentheses around the part of the calculation we would like performed first a syntax error so here if you if you write five multiply by two equal you will get a syntax error and if you write 52 divided by 43 will give you the answer so and by then if you if you write like an example if you write like um 43 divided by let's say 43 divided by 55 and biting and you didn't add the equal signs will give you the answer but if you wrote in python five multiple i by tu equal will give you a syntax error so i hope you learned some i hope you learned something in new make sure to like subscribe and hit the notification bell to get notified every time we upload a new video and bye for now
