my name is lean and in today's video i'll be giving you an introduction to a programming language so i'm going to be differentiating between programming language and computer program as well as giving you applications of programming language so before we start make sure to grab your notebook or some tea or snack and let's get started so let's just describe programming in few simple words so remember programming is a formal language which is used to communicate with computers based on instructions and commands while computer program is set of instructions that we give to a computer to tell them what to do let me repeat that programming is a formal language while computer program is set of instructions here are some examples of programming applications first we have fortran and fortran is used for mainly projects like designing bridges or airplane structures even analyzes scientific data fortune isn't really used by kids like you mainly for professional usage so you don't have to worry about that but next we have cobol kobul is also known as c plus and is it you can use this for developing games desk fabs and even operating systems c plus plus can allow you to divide complex problems into smallers using objects and then next we have python python is one of the programming languages with the highest levels it allows you to create applications and websites and few steps python can allow you to create literally anything you want you can make an app an application or a website even you can use python to um get to like develop your hacking skills python is really interesting and it's really easy for usage so let's talk a little bit more about python so why should you learn python python is not only one of the highest levels of programming but also gives the user flexibility to create complex tasks in a few simple steps if you look to python work for creating an app it might look like a disaster it might look really hard for you but if you actually understand what each of these um simple keyword that you put into the ideal shell what what do they mean it's going to be really easy so here are some advantages of python python is quick and efficient user friendly and even gives you that flexibility to create graphics and animations in very few simple steps python can also give import at torture modules for kids learning and beginners if you guys are excited to create your own python um animation then make sure to stay tuned for the future videos where i'm going to be teaching you guys how to install python and importing one of your first commands into the python shell so um i hope you guys enjoyed this video and learned a lot please make sure to like this and and subscribe to the channel to join the family even turn the notification bell on to um get notified every time you upload a new video make sure to comment all of your questions in the description in the comments section below and i'll be happy to answer them you can also find our powerpoint in the um in the description box and some more information so yeah keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
