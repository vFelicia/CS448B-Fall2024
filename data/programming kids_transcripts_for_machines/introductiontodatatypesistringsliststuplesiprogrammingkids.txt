hello programmers welcome or welcome back to programming kids my name is lynn today i'll give you guys a brief introduction about data types whether it's an app a software or website you need to know about data types in order to create that by the end of this video you will have a brief idea about data types you'll be able to define each you will know there's the short format for each you'll be able to give examples and understand the meaning of immutability so in python we have two types of numbers one is integers and the other is floating point these will make up our data type along with many others such as strings lists dictionaries tuples sets and booleans integers are whole numbers with no decimal point the short format is int examples are 1 billion 1034 670 literally any number that does not include a decimal point the other hand floating point are completely the opposite these are numbers with decimal points short format is floats and examples are 1 billion point 0 100.0 3.4 5678.9 strings are ordered sequence of characters the short format is str examples are hello lynn sarah 200.34 10 etc lists are pretty similar except that maybe this can include diff uh they include curly braces while strings include parentheses but we're going to talk more about the differentiating in another separate video the short format for lists is lists examples are 10 hello and 200.3 dictionaries on are unordered unordered key with a value pair and they include columns the short format is dict so this is an example we have curly braces and then we have my key the my key is name and the value is length geofools are ordered immutable sequence objects the short format is cube and examples are 10 hello 200.4 now if you didn't get what i mean by immutable i mean that once you create this tuple you cannot replace any element or you cannot reassign any element because it's immutable for example if you have the word hello and you'd like to change the o to e by reassigning or replacing unfortunately that doesn't happen in tuples along with many other data types sets are unordered collection of unique objects the short format is set and examples include a b c d e f g h i j k etc any alphabet booleans are logical value indicating true or false so for example you can ask python is 5 greater than 3 and they'll answer you true or false the short format is bool this is a summary for today's lesson there are some extra examples with the description with the with the short format and the definition and everything you need to know i hope you guys enjoyed this video we're going to go through each one of these data types in detail in our next video so make sure to subscribe and turn that notification bell on so that you can get notified when we upload that video give this video a big thumbs up and if you have any questions ask them in the comments section so that we can reply and we can clear it out thanks for watching keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
