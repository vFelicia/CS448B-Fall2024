hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lin and in today's video i'll be teaching you how to write your first program on python so today's objectives will be how to oh how to print like any sentence that you want i'll teach you how to print it how to open a new file and how to enter your first real program into python before we start make sure to grab a snack or a cup of tea and here we go so i'll be searching idle on my spotlight search all right i don't and here it is this is idle if you guys don't have python on your on your laptop then make sure to check the video in the description box where we showed you how to install python on macbook and windows in that video we also discussed what is idle what does it stand for what does it do and what is its function all right let's open idle now okay um so we have three dash signs over here and this is where you you're supposed to start writing your print function so let's just type print and then we have to put some brackets notice that you should only use the round brackets you cannot use like these or these you cannot use them and you should always start with a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark and end with the exact same one that you started with if you start with another one like if you start with double and you end up single it won't work it'll give you an error but now let's just put a single one and i'm going to write something and let's see your python princess and here we go so i'm gonna press enter and let's see if it's gonna get printed yay python said subscribe to programming kids did you hear that go do that right now okay let's try now with double quotation marks all right and enter like this video right now look over here we have i wrote now with capital letters and that's exactly what python made did it just obey you i don't want it to be python is like a game if you obey the rules they'll obey you okay but what if i try double and single at the same time do you guys think this will work well let's try right now i'm going to print and here we go i'll be starting with double quotation and here we go and end with single and close and enter oh it gave us an error so that means that you can never ever use double at the beginning and single at the end or the other way out okay now let's try printing the same um sentence but with double double quotations here we go here we go and boom coding is fun now that you guys might have understood the um rules for printing and you guys did a pretty good job with identifying them let's just move on to the next objective now we're going to be opening a new file on python so let's start all you have to do is look at the top bar of your laptop over here and press file new file and here it is this is our folder now we're going to be entering our first program into python so first we have to name it so we're gonna name it by using the hashtag sign and write name py oh yeah i forgot to tell you our program is going to be about python asking us what's our name and how if we answer it but they'll reply to us so here we go i named it name.py and python ignores this completely it's just for us to know what the folder is about okay now let's um put a variable so i'm gonna input a variable and i'll press an equal sign and input this is what i want um python to say i'm gonna put a bracket and publication works what your name so you can write what's your name honey what's your name um uncle what's your name grandfather what's your name um sir or what's your name mom or whatever you want but i'll write what's your name kid how about that and let's close it with exactly the same quotation mark and enter notice that nothing comes at the back that's because we didn't run it and in a second i'll teach you how to run now let's um print what we want python to answer so we'll print and brackets quotation marks hi comma quotation marks so here we have double quotation mark because we want python to replace this quotation mark with your name and we'll write name you might be thinking right now did she forget to put name at the end of the before the closing the bracket i mean to um did she forget to put quotation marks because before closing the bracket no i didn't but because name is a variable there is no need for putting um double quotation or a single quotation at the end okay now let's save it because you cannot run a module before saving it so let's file save and here we go i'll save it as name and i'll want to save it on my desktop and save as you guys can see python automatically saves it on my desktop over here and before we run this have you noticed that python color codes everything that's because python wants to make everything really easy for us if you guys can see print is like a function so it's in purple green this thing is green because i entered it blue is python printing what i wanted and red is forever same thing for here so now let's run this and i'm really excited do you think python will respond let's see what's your name kid my name is lynn hi lynn that is so cool python is really smart but what if i want python to say my name five times like what if i want python to say hi lim lin linlin lin wouldn't that be funny let's try it out so i'm just gonna press enter and type print um open some bracket and quotation marks i'll use double you can use single if you want and i'll write hi um comma quotation mark this is where as we said this is where python will replace the question mark with our name and comma again and i'll write name name name which we set in the variable and i'll type that five times name name and last one is name now let's close it with a bracket and as we said we don't put a quotation mark because it's a variable right let's print uh enter and save this because if you don't save it it won't work all right and press run run mode what's your name kid my name is lynn hi lynn hi lin lin linden lin isn't that funny i
