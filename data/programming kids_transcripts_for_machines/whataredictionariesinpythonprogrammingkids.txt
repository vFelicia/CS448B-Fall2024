hello programmers my name is sarah and today we're going to learn about dictionaries so let's get started by the end of this video you will understand the meaning of mapping understand what are dictionaries and their rules understand the differences between lists and dictionaries apply this concept into the jupiter notebook you will test your knowledge by taking a mini quiz what are mappings mappings are a collection of objects that are stored by a key what are dictionaries dictionaries are an order mapping for storing objects dictionaries is a key value and also in dictionaries use curly braces and columns to signify the key and their associated values what are the differences between the list and the dictionaries dictionaries objects utilized by key name and they are unordered while list object retrieved by location and order sequence can be indexed or sized let's hop into our entrepreneur notebook and explore more about dictionaries as jupiter notebook is very recalled on if you want to know more about them click click the link in the i the corner or click the link in the description box so that's the jupiter notebook so first we're going to start by creating a dictionary so i'm going to name it as animal dictionary animal dictionary which is equal to we can add curly braces and i'm gonna say a rat so there is one rat then i'm going to say a dog so irat is the string here as you can see let us say that there is three dogs i'm gonna run that so now if i want to see how many rats are there say animal animal dishonesty how many rats are there so use brackets and say rats run that and that will get one now i'm going to give you another example let us see that i went to an animal shop and there was a cat a bird and a dog a cat cost 70 and a bread cost 90 and the dog cost 120 so say prices which is equal to curly braces say a cat 70 a braid bridge is 90 and uh dog that is 120. so now i'm going to run that and if i want to know how what's the price of a cat as we did we're just going to say prices brackets cut will be 70. if i want to know what's the price of a dog i'm just going to say prices brackets dog i'm going to run that i will get 120. so now also in a dictionary we can add list strings and integers so let me show you an example i'm going to create a dictionary i'll name it as my dictionary which is equal to curly braces let us say a good a girl there's one good we're gonna say come on and we're gonna say boy now let us say that there is three boys so these three numbers we're gonna put them in a list so and let's say mom mom got a drink colin drink so now we're gonna run that so now now if i want to know how many boys are there i'm just gonna say my dick boy we're gonna run that we'll get one two three now if i want to know what did the mother got so i'm just gonna say my my dick mom i'll get garter chain but what if i want the input to be mom got and the output i want it to be drink so i'm just gonna here put the brackets and write your guts so the answer will be drink so and then if i want to make a letter and uppercase so let me just create a dictionary so i'm going to name it as d is equal to abc i'm going to add quotation marks and add quotation marks and say colin a a b and c as you can see guys so what if i want to make the c an uppercase so we're going to run that and now to make a be an uppercase we're going to create a list and we'll name it as my list which is equal to d the abc i'm gonna run that now we're gonna say letter that which is equal to my list my list and i want an indexing indexing of two so indexing of two i will run that and now we'll say letter.upper letter dot upper so now let me run that we'll get c now to make it more easy than doing all these steps we're just gonna say d stand for dictionary and then say abc and i wanted an indexing of two and then dot upper you're gonna put parentheses and run that we'll get c so now i want also to discuss with you guys how to add a value to a dictionary so i'm just going to create a dictionary i will say d is equal to let's see a pen a pin that's caused for like two dollars you can say chroma and also a box that cost five as you guys can see i'm gonna run that and now if we said we'll get it now if i want to change we said a pen is two but it's in numbers what if i want to change it to values to letters so we're going to say d d box we'll say which is equal to 2. so now i'm going to run it meet pen we're going to run that now if we said d we'll get pen as 2. lectures not numbers now guys the last thing i want to discuss with you guys is how to grab all the numbers how to grab all the let keys and values so i'm just gonna copy this again so just write it again b d is equal to pen this which is equal to two point zero zero to one zero and then we set up a box that cost for five so let's say five now we will run that now to get all the keys we're just going to say t dot keys and to get all the values we're just going to say d dot values to the value value we're gonna run that and then we're gonna do the item so t dot items run that and we get t dot items so okay guys stick to your knowledge on dictionaries question one dictionaries retain order and are a sequence is that true or false pause this video think about the answer and then when you are ready and post it again correct the answer is false because dictionaries are an ordered sequence question two what do i type to get the number of values either values these are items or detailed keys post this video think about the answers and then when you are ready and post it again correct the answer is jesus values question three in a dictionary can we add lists strings and integers is that true or false pause this view think about the answer and then when you are ready and pause it again correct the answer is true okay guys thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed the video if you did please like subscribe hit that
