hey guys welcome or welcome back to programming kids my name is sarah and today we're gonna learn about strings so what are you waiting for let's get right into it so let us talk about strings strings are used in python to record the text information such as names string and button are actually sequence which basically means python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence some strings we're going to learn about how to print and which are the basics of strings and fun stuff about strings so now let us pop into our jupiter network see some examples about streams i'm going to search about i'm going to start distributing notebook that's the command line now it's loading now to start coding we're gonna press new python 3 to start coding with you guys and if you're excited to learn about strings hit that like button so here you can see the input functions so first we're going to start with creating a strings and when you create a string you have to have either single or double quotation marks so be aware of it so so when you create a list you can put either double or single quotation marks so i'm gonna we i'm gonna add double quotation marks i'm gonna say hello world right it says hello world what if you said go sorry go subscribe to programming kids can run it go subscribe to programming kids which means now you have to go to programming kids and hit that subscribe button so now let us try to print and python so let us try to say brand print um my name is sarah my name is sarah rennett it says my name is sarah this is trying to add more sentence like let's start to say print we're going to say pockets any words you want it's fine it's not it's not print we're gonna say youtube and the last word i'm gonna say it's print and recording i'm going to run it it will say buckets youtube coding button is very smart so now let's just create a variable so we're going to say let's j is a variable literally is equal to f you can put any literally you want like it does not matching so let me run it so now if you want 100 s so we have to say leche multiply by hundreds we're gonna run it we will get 100 issues what if you want to change the letter to my name sierra you're gonna run it it will give you 100 sarahs and also try it with 1 000 liters let you multiply by one thousand that's crazy this will give you one thousand say rise so now let us let us create a string so we're gonna say you you is equal to my name my name is sarah so my name is sarah is stored and you so now let us run it oh i have to have to add here single quotation marks my name is sarah run click here run gonna say you will give us my name ser what if you want to add another sentence to my name sarah so you will get the variable u and say plus and write the sentence you want to add so i'm going to say hello world let us try to run it give us my name sarah hello world so now that's the sentence what if you want the sentence to be uppercase so you will use the udoc upper function upper function so that used up is a function so we're gonna run it give us my name sarah because we said we want you us name name sarah wants it to be uppercase so my name is sarah what if we wanted to be splat so we'll use the u function use plet us splat run it we'll get my name sir you can see it these are lists so now this is for today's video and also don't forget and things we use either double quotation marks or single quotation mark be aware of it so this is for today's video i hope you learned something new if you did please like and subscribe to join our family and hit that notification bell to get notified every time we upload a new video video and if you have any doubts you can reference in the comment section down below we'll be really happy to answer you guys keep going and i will see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
