welcome to programming tips my name is lynn and in today's video we will be creating a really cool turtle instead of that um arrow that you guys when you import it having this kind of turtle is really really cool and more interesting than the sign that you guys really import turtle and i know that you guys might be like this is hard but trust me all you have to do is learn one or two codes anyways make sure to grab a notebook or cup of tea and let's get started okay let's start by opening either and um opening a new file so press file new file and name your program so i'll name it as third as my turn dot py okay so this is just for me python skips this completely all right now we'll have to import created which is the mini program in python to show your graphics and what actually happens that python opens python launcher to view all of our graphic and then we'll have to name it so i'll name it as t is equal to thirty dot journal and put in your brackets and press enter then we will start choosing a color for our program or our character so t dot color and i'll use blue make sure to put in your quotations and we'll try saving it right now and running and i'll show you if i don't put the last code what happens all right i'll save it on my desktop just so i can view it later and i'll save it as dirt as my turtle as you guys can see python automatically saves it over here all right let's try running it here it is so nothing really happens at this really boring um arrow comes in let's try putting in the last thing which is the shape so i'll type see dot shape and open up my brackets and put in my question what shape do you think this turtle is well let me answer you the shape is that's it guys you'll have to run this right now and so you can always change the color and put it yours and you can even create different shapes with it so for example let's try drawing a square so i'll type in my code for i in range and i'll put in the range all right put in my column because this is a loop and then i want her to move um forward 150 steps and the angle is 90 degrees because it's a square a right angle all right now let's try running whoa my turtle is amazing at drawing that's it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed that little turtle and i'll make sure that you guys subscribe to join our family turn the notification bell on to be the first to view my videos as well as liking this video if you like this program programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye
