hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video i'll be teaching you guys um squares and rectangles in python this is more like an introduction to animation which is just the best part but python being able to draw a girl for your app or draw a girl for something or a company or a logo this probably has to be the best part of a python you have the flexibility to create amazing things but in order to do that you have to learn the basic shapes like a circle squares triangle rectangles and um in our last video we did we did a whole video about circles so make sure to check it out i'll be linking it in the description box okay now let's um tell you the three main things that we'll be talking about first we will create a square and we will fill it with your favorite color then we will create a rectangle and we will also fill that with your favorite color and last but not least the most the best part we're going to be creating a matrix so if you don't know what's a matrix and keep on watching all right make sure to grab a notebook or a cup of tea and let's get into it first i'll be opening idle which is the main thing for coding on python then i i'll have to create a new file so file new file and then i'll have to name my file so i'll name it as hashtag square dot py then i have to import turtle turtle is just the main thing for making your graphics real so whatever code you do python actually opens the python launcher and there are the view the the graphic okay now we will have to name our material i'll just name it with ask t you can name it as bob and press equal but for me i'll just name it as t so t is equal to turtle dots just like that and i'll have to put brackets and press enter then we will have to choose a color so that our turtle will use so i'll type the dot full color and open the bracket and type orange i want my turtle to use arm okay so let's just type that properly and press enter okay next we want to oops what happened okay next i want to start i want my turtle to start feeling like whatever shape i draw from now on i want materials to fill it with that color okay so we have to type d dot begin underscore fill okay and press enter then we will have to start a loop so i'll just type four i in range four okay and because this is a loop you'll have to put on you will have to put columns and press enter okay because we put column it starts underneath the eye and what does this what does this loop actually mean it means that we want turtle to draw this four times you can type whatever you have to four times but this is quicker and the code looks smaller okay and okay now let's type how many steps we want our children to move so i think i'll go okay uh i think i'll go ahead and make it 200. you can experiment with it maybe you can try making it 500 or maybe one or whatever you want okay and then i have to choose an angle because this is a square the angle is always 90 degrees right press enter and now we have to end the fold this is not part of the loop so i just started from the beginning and yeah okay and here it is i type d dot and underscore fill okay guys now let's save this and then run it i'll just save it on my desktop ask where and now let's run it whoa isn't that cool as perfect square with my favorite color how about we change it up a little bit how about i tie i make this thousand 6000 six thousand how about that let's see what happens whoa it's gigantic it doesn't even feel there oh look it doesn't work probably because our screen is too small and we're gonna have to maximize it oh my gosh it looks really long let's try making it smaller maybe type maybe type i should i think i should type one this time let me do 50 let's try 50 first then we can go smaller all right oh isn't that really small okay let's see what happens if i want to make my angle 60 degrees do you think this will look a square let's see whoops it is not a square and this is why you should always keep your um angle as 90 degrees if you're drawing a square rectangle all right let's try 10 and let's run this press enter and here it is oh my god that is so tiny okay guys that's it for this square program now let's move on to the next one i'm just gonna exit this and open it again and plus i always have my folder on my desktop in case i want to run this again and show it to my friends okay so we'll open idle again and start a new file oh okay then we'll have to name it and hashtag rectangle dot py and then oh i typed rectangle wrong all right then i have to import turtle okay let me just make this big okay then we will have to name our churches so i'll just name it as t turtle dot okay then i'll press enter and i'll pick the color i want my turtle to use so i think i'll put pink okay then i want her to begin fill right after i choose the color so begin underscore fill because it's a variable okay then i have to start my loop so for eyes i want her to repeat this whenever i'm writing right now two times and because this is a loop i will always put in columns and press enter okay and now i have to choose how many steps i wanted to move forward okay forward i want her to move 150 let's make it 300 250 so make it more interesting okay then left 90 degrees because it has a right angle okay and forward again this time 200 this time 300. forward all right and last but not least left one more time 90 degrees okay and we're going to be ending the fill so t dot end underscore and here we go now let's run it but before we do that let's make sure to save it i'll save it as rectangle okay and on my desktop just beside the first one okay and here it is rectangle.py all right let's run this whoa isn't that nice this is really cool i really love the pink color it might look like a square but um this side is different from this side so they don't have equal side so this is just proof that it's not a square okay let's try changing it up a little bit so how about we make it we make this 150 let's run this that looks more like a rectangle to me but how about i make this big how about i make this 400 let's see what happens oh okay yeah that's a perfect rectangle to me well i really love the color of this rectangle and python has a really good job of choosing the colors like the orange one too from the square was really cool now let's exit and we can always go back to it from my desktop and show it to my friends and let's move on to the to the last program the matrix matrix so let's go ahead and open idle and get ready for this so we're going to be opening a new file and naming it so i'll just name it as hashtag um matrix and press enter okay now i'll have to um import turtle import and press enter then i'll have to name my character so i'll name it i'll name her as tv so turtle dots okay and this might be a little bit confusing but it's we're all just defining in the first part in the whole first part we're just defining every single thing because python won't understand if you don't define okay so we will start defining so dia means define so i'll enter my variable over here so it's joe underscore bill underscore rectangle so basically the matrix is small rectangles and they will be filled okay but i'm going to be defining what is going to be inside this over here okay one there will be my turtle there will be the x axis and the yaxis then i'll have my width i'll have a height i'll have a size a color and fill okay and then here put my columns and press enter okay so make sure that you included each of these okay so i had a t i have an x i have a y with height size color info so in total you're supposed to have one two three four five six seven and eight okay let's move on now i'll be typing in the full command and um i'll have to put the main thing from that command like i'll i'll type it in and hopefully you guys will understand so tdot fill color and t dot pen color and then um t dot pen size okay and then t dot set heading okay okay so now from the fill color the most important thing that i have that python should get me from here is the fill here it's the color okay color then here is the size and for the set heading just type zero you don't really have to worry about this decide 0 okay and then we will continue um so t dot g dot again underscore film so i'm telling my churchill to begin their fell right now okay and then i want you to go up okay so t up then i want you to go on to x axis and the y axis so t does go to x comma y okay then i want you to go down so t dot down now we will be just um learning the first part about our rectangle so so t dot forward we're just going to specify what does that mean okay see the forward oh okay um the width this is the width i'm just telling python okay then um the right you'll be drawing the right now so t dot rise that should be at 90 degrees because this is a um rectangle okay and now over here we're drawing the right side okay so the right side of the rectangle so the angle is 90 degrees and the forward that so forward this is the height specifying that for python and for you guys also okay next we will be drawing the bottom part so t dot right and that is a 90 degrees then um that t dot t.4 rate is that's the width for the bottom part okay then i have the left side okay so t dot right 90 degrees okay then the um the forwards when it moves forward this will be the height height okay and then um i'm going to be ending my field right over here that's it turtle you don't have to color anything anymore okay and here we go yeah okay now i'm gonna be checking that my program over here is correct okay so okay let's move on now we will be just um creating another loop this is the end of the first loop this all was a loop probably why it was really um confusing now we're going to start a new one and this is for just the range for x and y and just defining the full the full rectangle just how many steps i wanted to move and then we're done okay so first let's type the range for axle for x for x and y i'll make the move range should be both the same so um for x in range one and eight okay i'm gonna put a column then four y in range that should be the same so one and eight okay and we'll put my column again because this is a loop then last but not least i'm just gonna um type in with a throw underscore fold underscore rectangle how many times i want that to be how wide the x and the y how much i want them to be so don't underscore underscore rectangle and i'll open up my brackets and type t minus 200 plus x times so this here is here this is for x times 20. this is how many steps i want my um accent b okay then for my y i wanted to move y times 20. that's it i'll just type some extra information so 20 another 20 in a two and now i'll choose my colors so my colors i want them to be black and white because i believe that that would be the coolest you can go ahead and try red in like green or red and black or whatever you want okay so i'll type white white comma black all right and i'll have to close the brackets all right guys so we're probably done so i'll go ahead and type turtle dot done her job is finished she is done okay here it is so again let's check this but probably because it's complicated you'll always have feeling that there's something wrong with this so i'm just gonna check all right seems like everything is good let's try saving it and i'll just save it next to my three um to my other two so i'll save it as matrix on my desktop and we'll save it and here it is i have all my three things that i created today storage over here so i can show my friends all right guys now we're going to have to run this so here we go moment through okay this is starting up on flow but wait for the result let's wait whoa guys isn't this really cool i don't know why but i find it real really cool let's try to change up the colors how about red and black let's run this let's see how it looks whoa that's also really cool but i feel like white is probably my favorite at white and black because the screen the background is white so i just feel like it looks really cool but you can also make the background red if you want well guys that's it for today's video i hope you guys learned a lot about rectangles and triangle i mean rectangles and squares and i hope this wasn't as hard for you i just thought it would be a fun thing to include in today's video because it has something to do with rectangles so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
