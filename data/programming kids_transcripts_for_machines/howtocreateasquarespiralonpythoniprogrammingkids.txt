hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lin and in today's video i'll be teaching you how to draw a simple um square spiral on python this is for beginners so i'll be doing for you a little tutorial and i'll give you easy steps so what are you waiting for go grab a notebook or a cup of c and let's get into it so first i have to search my idol which is the main thing for coding on my spotlight search and we're just going to search your idol and enter it automatically opens idol and it's right over here let me make it a little bit bigger and now i have to open a new file because in order to create my graphic i should be on a new file so i'll press file new file and here we are okay so you should always name your file not for python but just for you to identify python actually skips this completely just for you so we're just gonna hashtag and i'll just name it squarespiral because that's what i'm going to be drawing and obviously dot py oh there should be no space too so dot p y and enter now we're going to use the turtle program which is just a little mini program in python for drawing graphics and being creative and i have to import that so let's just type import turtle and enter again and then now i want my churchill to immediately hold her pen and get ready for draw in order to do that you should first name your turtle and for me i'll just name her t so i'll write t is equal to turtle the pen make sure to write the p in capital letters or else on python will give you an error and enter now i want um my turtle to i'm going to write the size of my turtle so i'm just going to type 4x in range 98 okay 298 and um this is how big i want my turtle to be you can also write 100 and usually um you should go from zero to 100 and you can't go beyond that okay and we have to put a column and press enter and as you guys can see this is a um loop it doesn't go at the back it goes directly underneath the axe okay and um now i'm going to just write how much i want my turtle to be as in width so brackets and two all right let's do four four times x axis just um unknown so yeah enter again and this is my um angle i want it to be obviously a 90 degrees as we're drawing a square but if you want to go ahead and make it like a curved thing then you can change the number and we're going to open my brackets the right 90 in there and here we go that's probably it this graphic is really easy but we can add some stuff but for now let's just run it so first you have to save it or else python will give us an error and i'll save it on my desktop and save it as how about square just paragraph and python automatically saves it oh i i also spelled the graphic wrong but that's not a problem anyways let's run run module and here we go let's see whoa isn't that cool it's like a maze but don't you think my turtle is too slow how about i make it fast okay let's go to my um file and i'm going to be entering a command right underneath the turtle.pen and i just want it to be zero speed zero basically as fast as possible so i'm right t speed and here we go zero let's save it and run whoa our youtube can draw really fast and pretty much that's it for this um program and i hope you guys enjoyed making this as much as i did make sure to make your own maybe contain the colors um try the with different and just play with it this is the only way you can learn python and other than that see you guys in my next video make sure to subscribe to join our family and to be a mini programmer and just like this video if you enjoyed it and keep programming kids and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
