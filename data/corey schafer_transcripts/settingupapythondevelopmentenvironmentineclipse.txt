00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:01 - video we will learn how to set up a
00:04 - Python development environment using the
00:06 - Eclipse IDE and the pydev plugin so if
00:11 - you've watched my videos before then
00:12 - you've probably noticed that I do a lot
00:14 - of my Python programming within a text
00:16 - editor called sublime text now the
00:19 - reason that I use that for my tutorials
00:21 - is because it's nice and clean and
00:24 - there's not a lot of other bells and
00:25 - whistles that are getting in the way and
00:27 - it really allows us just to focus on the
00:30 - code but an IDE which is an integrated
00:33 - development environment it does have
00:35 - some advantages over a text editor so
00:37 - for example if you want to debug your
00:40 - code then eclipse will allow us to set
00:43 - breakpoints and and step through line by
00:47 - line in our code and print out variables
00:49 - and step in the functions and a lot of
00:51 - different things that we just can't do
00:53 - in a text editor so in this video we
00:57 - will get Eclipse installed and also get
01:01 - a Python environment set up to where we
01:03 - can begin writing Python code so right
01:06 - now I'm over here on the Eclipse website
01:08 - and so the first thing that we're going
01:11 - to do is install this Eclipse installer
01:14 - so let's go ahead I'm on a Mac so I'm
01:16 - going to download this Eclipse installer
01:18 - it's going to take us to another
01:20 - download page here and I'm just going to
01:22 - click this download link here and it
01:25 - will take you to a donation page eclipse
01:28 - is open-source software so if you have
01:31 - the money to make a donation then I'm
01:33 - sure they'd appreciate it
01:34 - but if if not then we can just wait for
01:37 - our download to finish ok so that a
01:39 - download has finished so I'm going to go
01:41 - ahead and open up this Eclipse installer
01:45 - okay now first thing when you open up
01:48 - the Eclipse installer right off the bat
01:50 - you might see this over here that says
01:52 - that it needs an update
01:54 - so let's go ahead and run that update
01:56 - and it'll restart the installer for us
02:00 - okay so now we've restarted that
02:02 - installer now this is the point where
02:04 - some people get confused because there's
02:06 - not a specific version of Eclipse just
02:10 - for python right out of the box so you
02:13 - can see here that
02:13 - we have an eclipse ide for java
02:15 - developers for c and c++ PHP and all
02:19 - these different things now a lot of
02:21 - people will just download the java
02:23 - developers version and then add in all
02:25 - the python stuff after that on their own
02:27 - and it does come with some it already
02:31 - does come with a git client and the
02:33 - marketplace and things like that but
02:36 - really I don't like that extra overhead
02:39 - so kind of what I like to start with
02:41 - whenever I'm doing Python development is
02:43 - just to start with the Eclipse platform
02:45 - and you can see here that it says that
02:46 - this package contains the absolute
02:48 - minimal IDE suitable only as a base for
02:52 - installing other tools and that's what
02:54 - we want to do are going to install a
02:55 - Python environment on top of this so I'm
02:58 - going to go ahead and choose that
03:00 - platform and you can choose the Java
03:02 - version if you'd like and everything
03:03 - will still work just fine but now that
03:07 - we're in here I'm just going to accept
03:08 - these defaults it's going to install the
03:10 - Java JVM and then the installation
03:12 - folder you can choose where it installs
03:14 - Eclipse so I'm just going to choose
03:15 - install here and let this finish now
03:18 - once this finishes here I'm just going
03:19 - to go ahead and launch this and when it
03:22 - first pops up it may ask us a couple of
03:25 - things so for example it's going to
03:26 - asked us ask us to select a workspace
03:28 - and this is where it will put all of our
03:32 - projects and files so I'm just going to
03:34 - accept this default location here and so
03:38 - now we have a new version of Eclipse
03:40 - here so I'm just going to maximize this
03:43 - and then I'm going to click on go to
03:45 - workbench here ok so now that we're
03:48 - within here now we want to install PI
03:51 - dev pipe f is a plugin which will allow
03:54 - us to do python development so for
03:56 - example right now right out of the box
03:58 - if we go up here and go file new project
04:02 - you can see here that all we have is
04:04 - this general project here there's
04:06 - nothing that is python specific so to
04:08 - fix this let's go to help and we want to
04:12 - install new software now the new
04:15 - software that I'm going to install is
04:17 - one called marketplace now this is
04:21 - something that allows us to install
04:23 - things in the future a little bit more
04:26 - easy
04:26 - now Market Place comes installed already
04:29 - if you were to choose the Java version
04:31 - but from where we started from just the
04:34 - bare minimum Eclipse platform we need to
04:37 - install the marketplace so I'm just
04:39 - going to choose all available sites here
04:42 - for what to work with and then I'm just
04:45 - going to search for market and it should
04:47 - find that for us so it's here under
04:49 - general purpose tools marketplace client
04:52 - so I'm going to go ahead and choose that
04:53 - and then walk through this installation
04:56 - process and go ahead and accept these
04:58 - terms and choose all the defaults so now
05:00 - it is installed and it says that we need
05:02 - to restart eclipse that's probably going
05:04 - to happen a few times while we're doing
05:05 - this so let's go ahead and do that so
05:07 - now that we have restarted Eclipse we
05:10 - should have the marketplace installed so
05:13 - now if we click on help instead of going
05:16 - to install new software let's go ahead
05:18 - and click on this Eclipse marketplace
05:20 - now the marketplace is just a more
05:23 - visually appealing
05:25 - area to download new software rather
05:28 - than the where we were before where we
05:31 - had to manually look through all those
05:33 - different sites for the marketplace and
05:36 - things like that so what we want to
05:38 - install here in the marketplace is pydev
05:40 - now we can either search for it but it's
05:42 - also very popular so we just if we just
05:44 - click on this popular time then it
05:46 - should just be the third or fourth one
05:48 - down from the bottom and you can see you
05:50 - can also install whatever else you want
05:52 - here you can see that there are some
05:54 - color themes some ways to integrate
05:56 - Eclipse with subversion so if we scroll
06:00 - down here you can see that pydev I think
06:03 - it was like the fifth one down so we can
06:06 - just click install here and it's going
06:09 - to tell us all the things that we need
06:11 - to install with this so let's go ahead
06:13 - and click confirm and let this run the
06:15 - room now I'm going to go ahead and
06:17 - accept these terms and click finish and
06:20 - now this may take a while to install
06:24 - here I'm going to go ahead and trust
06:27 - these certificates and click OK
06:29 - now once that is finished installing
06:31 - them we'll have to restart eclipse again
06:33 - so let's go ahead and do that okay so
06:35 - now we have pydev installed so we should
06:37 - be able to go to file new
06:40 - project like we did before but now
06:42 - instead of just general here we have
06:45 - this pydev option and if we go down and
06:49 - into here we can see that we can make a
06:52 - Django project we can make a Google
06:54 - Google App Engine project or just a PI
06:57 - dev project and this is just for your
06:59 - regular Python projects so I'm going to
07:01 - choose PI dev project and click Next and
07:03 - then I'm just going to call this project
07:06 - name demo underscore project and then we
07:11 - can to use all of the defaults here you
07:14 - can see that's going to put it into our
07:15 - workspace here we can choose our Python
07:18 - version that we want to use I'm just
07:20 - going to leave it at 2.7 now it may
07:22 - choose an interpreter for you but it may
07:24 - say that you don't have an interpreter
07:27 - selected so what I'm just going to do
07:30 - here is click on please configure an
07:32 - interpreter and just let it auto
07:34 - configure its just going to choose my
07:35 - default Python interpreter so that may
07:39 - have already selected the default
07:40 - interpreter for you but if it didn't
07:42 - then you can just click on that link
07:44 - that I clicked on and click on the quick
07:47 - auto configuration and it should set the
07:50 - default interpreter for you so for
07:53 - everything else I'm just going to leave
07:54 - the defaults and click finish and now
07:57 - this is going to pop up and say that
07:59 - this kind of project is an associated
08:01 - with the pydev perspective you want to
08:03 - open this perspective now I'm just going
08:06 - to click on remember my decision and hit
08:08 - yes and I usually recommend that you
08:10 - open up the PI deaf perspective because
08:12 - it lays out all your windows here and
08:15 - the way that they believe is best for
08:18 - python development and if you don't
08:20 - entirely like the layout then you can
08:22 - always customize it yourself later on so
08:25 - now we have this demo project here and
08:27 - I'm just going to right click on this
08:30 - demo project and go to new and now you
08:33 - can see that we have a file but instead
08:36 - of file I'm going to choose PI dev
08:38 - module so now this is another case where
08:41 - an IDE kind of comes in handy over a
08:44 - text editor because this can set up a
08:46 - lot of stuff for us so for example if I
08:48 - want to put my module directly inside of
08:50 - a package so I can just do a test
08:52 - underscore
08:53 - as the name of the package I don't want
08:55 - to put it in and you can see here it's
08:57 - going to say note package not found
08:59 - which mean it doesn't exist yet and that
09:01 - they will create it for us so now the
09:03 - name of my module I'm just going to call
09:05 - this test module and I don't think you
09:09 - need to put the dot pie yeah so it says
09:11 - that the name may not contain any dots
09:13 - so it'll put the dot pie extension on
09:16 - for you so just call it a test module or
09:18 - whatever you want to call it and click
09:20 - finish and then it's going to cop pop up
09:22 - with some preferences here and I'm just
09:24 - going to leave these defaults and click
09:25 - OK and now it's going to ask us if we
09:28 - want to use a template so if we use the
09:32 - empty template then it's just going to
09:34 - put the timestamp at the top of the file
09:37 - but if you're going to write a class or
09:39 - something like that then you can choose
09:40 - the class template and it'll fill in a
09:42 - lot of boilerplate code for you like
09:44 - it'll put the dunder init function in
09:48 - for you and and things like that but I'm
09:50 - just going to choose the empty template
09:52 - and you can make your own templates also
09:54 - if you have a specific way that you like
09:56 - to make new files but for now I'm just
09:58 - going to hit empty and you may see this
10:01 - pop up to read documentation for pi dev
10:04 - I'm just going to click on show later ok
10:07 - so now I have my newly created test
10:10 - module and you can see that it did add
10:12 - in the date and the author here and you
10:16 - can also see over here on the right
10:18 - within our project that when we put this
10:20 - within a package it went ahead and made
10:22 - the init file for us over here and
10:25 - everything like that so it's nice that
10:27 - it went ahead and made all the files
10:28 - that we need in order to make this a
10:30 - package so now we should be ready to
10:33 - write some code here so if I just do a
10:36 - print HelloWorld now I am in Python 2:7
10:40 - still so the print function is going to
10:43 - look like this and now I can just go
10:45 - ahead and run this code and when I run
10:47 - it it's going to ask me if I want to run
10:49 - it as a Python or as a unit test so I'm
10:52 - just going to choose Python click OK and
10:54 - now you can see that it ran our code
10:57 - here and that's showing the output
10:58 - within the console
10:59 - so really if you wanted just a basic
11:02 - Python setup and Eclipse then
11:06 - should be done you can go ahead and do
11:07 - whatever it is that you need to do but
11:10 - I'm also going to show you some of my
11:12 - more favorite preferences here so for
11:15 - example the first thing I'm going to do
11:17 - is change the font and make it a little
11:19 - bit bigger and I also like dark themes
11:22 - just because whenever I'm looking at a
11:25 - computer sometimes these really bright
11:27 - themes kind of hurt my eyes after some
11:30 - time so for here for the theme instead
11:33 - of Mac I'm just going to choose dark and
11:36 - for the color and font theme I'm also
11:38 - going to choose well I'll just leave
11:41 - that default and click apply and see how
11:43 - this looks okay so that looks good there
11:45 - with the dark theme and now I'm also
11:47 - going to expand the appearance here and
11:50 - go on colors and fonts and for the basic
11:53 - font which will control this font in
11:55 - here I'm going to scroll down and the
11:58 - text font is what you want to change to
12:00 - change the font within your source code
12:03 - editor here so I'm going to edit this
12:06 - and I'm going to use source code Pro and
12:10 - I'm going to set this just so you guys
12:12 - can see better I'm going to choose size
12:13 - 18 for now and apply that and click OK
12:18 - and actually I'm going to open up these
12:20 - preferences one more time and show you
12:22 - guys it looks like this font got set to
12:26 - something else here maybe I don't have
12:28 - source code Pro installed on this
12:31 - machine or my clicks are just kind of
12:35 - moving around here funny okay so yeah
12:38 - that's what I wanted there now there are
12:40 - also some pydev specific preferences
12:43 - that we can run so if we look over here
12:45 - and the right we have this pydev option
12:47 - so if I expand this then within editor
12:52 - I'm going to open this up now within
12:54 - here you can specifically choose how you
12:56 - want certain things to look as far as
12:59 - your decorators and numbers and things
13:00 - like that but really the one thing that
13:03 - I like to select whenever I first
13:07 - install Clips is to go in here to code
13:09 - style and then code formatter and I like
13:12 - to automatically set my code to be Auto
13:16 - pepp 8 compliant so I'm going to click
13:18 - this
13:19 - use auto Pep eight for code formatting
13:22 - now if there are any I don't know you
13:24 - don't if you don't know what auto Pepe
13:26 - it is it's not a big deal but it's just
13:28 - a way to kind of check your code for
13:30 - certain income to make your code more
13:33 - consistent and also if there's anything
13:36 - that you want to ignore with Auto Pepe
13:38 - you can look to all these up online then
13:41 - you can put in your ignores here so if
13:43 - there are certain errors that you want
13:44 - to skip over then you can do this - -
13:46 - ignore within here and set it up that
13:49 - way I'm also going to click here on save
13:52 - actions and it says that the apply save
13:55 - actions I'm going to do an auto format
13:59 - editor contents before saving now what
14:02 - this means is that I don't have to what
14:05 - it's just going to auto format all of
14:08 - the code right before I save the code so
14:12 - now I'm going to go down here to apply
14:13 - and click OK and then click OK here so
14:17 - now for example if I go to write a
14:20 - function and do a test function here and
14:24 - then just pass this and then do a test
14:28 - to function and then go to save it now
14:32 - let me put in the pass code here as well
14:35 - and now you can see whenever I save that
14:37 - it automatically put in the spacing
14:41 - between these two different functions so
14:42 - I like that Auto pepe selection if you
14:46 - don't like it then you can turn it off
14:47 - but it's nice whenever you're working on
14:49 - large projects for everybody to have all
14:52 - their spacing and everything like that
14:53 - consistent so that about does it for the
14:56 - basic Python setup within Eclipse that I
14:59 - wanted to show you guys now if you do
15:01 - want to install more software then I
15:03 - would give the marketplace a look
15:06 - you know eclipse has a lot of different
15:09 - plugins so they have plugins for git if
15:12 - you want to use some git functionality
15:14 - within Eclipse they have other color
15:17 - themes that you can choose from this
15:19 - default color theme here it isn't the
15:22 - one that I usually use I usually install
15:25 - some other ones that look a little bit
15:27 - better so if you want to look at any of
15:29 - those then you can just do a search here
15:32 - if I just type in
15:33 - color then some stuff will come back and
15:36 - also I would give the popular tab a look
15:40 - because if you click on the popular tab
15:42 - then these are some of the more popular
15:45 - color themes and also like I said some
15:48 - of the plugins that people frequently
15:51 - use like this so this one is for
15:53 - subversion and they also have this
15:56 - moonrise dark theme that is likely a
15:59 - little bit different than this dark
16:00 - theme here so I would definitely give
16:02 - all those a look all those over and try
16:05 - to set this up to the way that you like
16:07 - it but that about does it for this video
16:09 - if you have any questions about this
16:12 - stuff just ask in the comment section
16:13 - below be sure to subscribe for future
16:16 - videos I know maybe I'll make some
16:18 - videos on how to debug projects within
16:21 - Eclipse and things like that so
16:23 - hopefully you all found this video
16:25 - useful and thank you for watching
