00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in this
00:02 - video we'll be going over some simple
00:03 - terminal commands to get you more
00:05 - comfortable within the command line in a
00:07 - previous video we learned how to
00:09 - navigate the file system without
00:10 - altering the file system in any way but
00:13 - in this walk there will actually be
00:15 - creating files and directories will be
00:17 - deleting files and directories and we'll
00:20 - also learn how to copy rename and move
00:23 - files and directories so I'll have my
00:26 - finder window opened on this side of the
00:29 - screen so we can visually get an idea of
00:31 - what's going on so let's go ahead and
00:33 - get started so first of all over here in
00:35 - the terminal if I run PWD which stands
00:38 - for working directory we can see that
00:41 - I'm currently within my user folder
00:43 - projects demos terminal and basics now
00:47 - this is also the folder that I'm in over
00:49 - here within finder so that we can see
00:51 - what's going on now let's go ahead and
00:53 - create a directory within this folder
00:55 - called testdir and the way that we're
00:57 - going to do that is MK dir make there
01:01 - and we'll call this tests birth now you
01:04 - can see when I ran that that this folder
01:05 - popped up over here within finder but
01:08 - within the terminal we can run LS and we
01:10 - run LS we can see that the directory is
01:12 - also showing up within terminal so now
01:15 - let's go ahead and navigate to that
01:16 - directory and to do that we do CD test
01:19 - dirt and navigate into there and within
01:22 - finder we'll just click into it so now
01:24 - let's create a file within this
01:26 - directory called test file so I'm going
01:29 - to do a touch to create this file and
01:31 - that'll be test underscore file dot txt
01:34 - and if I run that command you can see
01:37 - over here in the Finder window that that
01:38 - test file was created now I'm going to
01:41 - go ahead and open this file and add some
01:42 - text so that we have some unique file
01:44 - contents to work with and we can do this
01:47 - within the terminal with open test file
01:50 - dot txt and that will use the default
01:51 - program on your machine to open up this
01:54 - file and the contents that I'm going to
01:56 - add here are just I'm just going to call
01:58 - it test file txt the same name as the
02:02 - file slightly different so now let's go
02:05 - ahead and close that down so now let's
02:07 - learn how we can make a copy of this
02:09 - file within terminal to do this we use
02:11 - the CP command
02:13 - I'm going to do CP and then to
02:16 - autocomplete like that I'm just hitting
02:17 - tab after I type a little bit so I'm
02:20 - going to do CP test underscore file.txt
02:23 - and this new file I'm just going to call
02:26 - copy file dot txt so now if I hit enter
02:29 - there you can see within our Finder
02:31 - window that it created this copy file
02:32 - dat txt and if I open this up you can
02:35 - see that it does have the same file
02:37 - contents that we put in the first file
02:39 - so it is a copy so now let's look at how
02:41 - we can rename a file now renaming a file
02:44 - might seem a little weird because moving
02:47 - a file and renaming a file is actually
02:49 - the same process so if you want to
02:51 - rename a file then you use the MV
02:55 - command which is the move command and
02:56 - since we're just going to leave it in
02:58 - the same place we're going to move the
03:00 - file to the same directory but give it a
03:03 - different name so I'm going to rename
03:05 - test underscore file.txt to original
03:10 - file dot txt so I'm going to do move
03:12 - test file dot txt and I'm going to call
03:16 - this a ridge underscore file dot txt and
03:19 - you can see when I ran that command we
03:21 - no longer have test file that txt we
03:24 - have this a ridge file that txt now what
03:26 - if we want to move a file without
03:28 - renaming the file we can do that by
03:30 - specifying a new location and no file
03:34 - name so to show an example of that I'm
03:36 - actually going to create a new directory
03:38 - here in this current folder called
03:40 - subtor 1 so if we remember its make
03:42 - their sub door 1 and you can see that
03:46 - here within finder now I'm going to move
03:49 - this original file dot txt to sub door 1
03:52 - but I'm not going to rename the file so
03:54 - I can do that just by doing a move a
03:57 - ridge file dot txt and now I'm going to
04:00 - type in the new location and I want to
04:02 - put this within subdora
04:03 - so if I run that you can see that the
04:05 - file vanished over here within finder
04:07 - and within terminal I'm going to CD and
04:09 - the sub door 1 into an LS and you can
04:11 - see that the file is there if I navigate
04:14 - there in finder you can see that is
04:16 - there also so now I'm going to move it
04:19 - and rename it at the same time so to do
04:21 - this I can just do a move a ridge file
04:24 - dot txt and I'm going
04:26 - move this up one directory into our
04:29 - tester folder which is visible over here
04:31 - in finder and now that I've specified
04:33 - the location I'm going to go ahead and
04:35 - give it its name back to file dot txt so
04:39 - if I run that command now we can see
04:41 - that this sub door one is empty and that
04:44 - the original file got moved back to our
04:47 - tester and renamed at the same time and
04:50 - if I open this up you can see that the
04:52 - contents are still the same okay now
04:53 - let's look at how we can delete some
04:55 - files to delete a file we can use the RM
04:58 - command so let's remove this copied file
05:01 - here with RM copy oh and actually I'm in
05:05 - subtor one so let me CD backup a
05:07 - directory so now I'm going to do RM copy
05:10 - file dot txt and you can see over here
05:13 - within testdir that the copy file that
05:16 - txt was deleted now be careful when
05:19 - you're running remove files from within
05:21 - the terminal because deleting a file
05:23 - within the terminal isn't the same as
05:25 - deleting a file on your filesystem
05:27 - it doesn't ask you are you sure and they
05:30 - don't get sent to your trashcan for easy
05:32 - recovery so when they're gone they're
05:34 - gone so be careful when using the remove
05:37 - files within the terminal now we've been
05:39 - looking at how we can copy and rename
05:41 - and delete files now let's look at how
05:43 - we can do some of these same things to
05:45 - directories working with directories can
05:47 - be slightly different than working with
05:49 - files so let's go ahead and move up a
05:52 - directory here so that we can see our
05:53 - entire testdir directory so if I do an
05:56 - LS you can see that we have our tester
05:59 - here and I'm going to go ahead and do
06:00 - that over here within finder also so now
06:02 - let's try to copy our testdir to a
06:06 - directory called copy der in the same
06:08 - way that we did a file so I'm going to
06:10 - do a CP testdir and then I want to name
06:14 - the copy copy Durr so let's run that so
06:17 - the first problem that we run into here
06:19 - is that it says that copy dirt doesn't
06:21 - exist so let's go ahead and make a
06:23 - directory called copy dirt and run that
06:26 - now you can see that this directory
06:28 - exists but it's empty so now let's try
06:30 - that command again copy the tester into
06:33 - copy dirt now you can see that we're
06:35 - getting this message that tester is a
06:37 - directory not copied so in order to get
06:40 - around
06:40 - this we need to use the - our option now
06:44 - remember if you never need to find out
06:46 - more about the options that are
06:47 - available to you then you can do that by
06:50 - viewing the man page by typing man and
06:53 - then the command that you want to look
06:54 - at so we did man CP and then you can
06:56 - look at all the options that you have
06:58 - available to you there and you can just
07:00 - hit Q to get out of that so we're going
07:02 - to be using the - R option so really
07:04 - quick let's just take a look at what
07:06 - that means exactly so you can see here
07:09 - this - R it says if the source file
07:11 - designates a directory CP copies the
07:15 - directory and the entire subtree
07:16 - connected at that point so that's what
07:18 - we want so let's go ahead and do that so
07:21 - if I go back to my CP command I'm going
07:23 - to come back here to the beginning and
07:25 - do a - R so now if I run this and make
07:30 - this half the size of the screen so now
07:32 - we didn't get any errors that time so if
07:34 - we do open this up you can see that it
07:37 - has all of the same contents that test
07:39 - our head so now we successfully copied
07:41 - our entire directory so now let's try to
07:45 - rename the directory remember when we
07:48 - rename the files we use the MV command
07:50 - so let's try to do that to our tester so
07:53 - I'm going to do a move tester and let's
07:57 - rename this to a ridge Durr so if I run
08:00 - that then you can see that we didn't get
08:03 - any errors and that over here within
08:04 - finder it did rename this to a register
08:07 - so the MV command renamed the directory
08:10 - without needing any additional options
08:12 - and also like files I can move the
08:16 - directory without renaming the directory
08:20 - so if I wanted to do an MV of a ridge
08:23 - there I'm going to move this entire
08:25 - directory within the copy directory so
08:29 - if I run that then we can see that it
08:32 - took it out of this folder here and if I
08:35 - navigate to copy durr it still has the
08:37 - other contents that tester used to have
08:39 - but we also have the original directory
08:42 - here and it contains all these contents
08:44 - as well so now lastly just like we did
08:47 - with files let's go ahead and move the
08:49 - directory back up to the parent
08:51 - directory and rename it at the same time
08:53 - and we'll rename it back to tester so in
08:56 - order to do this I'm going to CD into
08:59 - the copied er here and that's where we
09:01 - are within finder over here and I'm
09:04 - going to do a move and I'm going to move
09:07 - the original directory up one directory
09:10 - to the parent and then at the same time
09:12 - I'm going to rename it to tester so if I
09:15 - run that you can see that the original
09:17 - directory is no longer within the copy
09:19 - directory and if I navigate back to the
09:21 - parent folder then it was renamed to
09:24 - tester and you can see that all the
09:26 - subfolders and files are still there so
09:29 - one more thing just like with the files
09:31 - let's go ahead and try to delete the
09:33 - word directory so if we remember when we
09:35 - deleted the file we use the RM command
09:38 - so let's do an RM and let's try to
09:41 - delete this copy directory so and
09:43 - actually I need to navigate up to my
09:46 - parent folder where these two
09:48 - directories are and now let's do an RM
09:51 - and let's remove the copy directory now
09:54 - you can see here that I got this error
09:56 - and just like copying a file it says
09:59 - that copied ur is a directory so also
10:02 - just like copying we can add the - R
10:04 - option and it will remove the directory
10:06 - so I'm going to do an RM - r on copy
10:10 - dirt so now if I run that within finder
10:13 - over here you can see that the copy
10:15 - directory was deleted
10:16 - so one last quick note here sometimes
10:19 - you might run into some files that give
10:21 - you issues when you try to delete them
10:23 - if you want you can force a deletion of
10:26 - the directory by using the - F option
10:29 - now again you do want to be careful with
10:31 - this now to do this you do RM and then -
10:35 - are because we are deleting a directory
10:38 - and we're going to do this - F to force
10:40 - the deletion and then I'm just going to
10:42 - delete the tester that we have here and
10:45 - if I run that you can see that it
10:47 - deleted the directory so once again be
10:49 - careful with that command because it's
10:51 - very powerful and it will permanently
10:53 - delete your files the only way to
10:55 - recover them would be from some kind of
10:58 - backup and that's not something that
10:59 - anyone likely wants to do you're also
11:02 - just a reminder there's a ton of other
11:04 - options that you can use with these
11:05 - commands should be sure to check
11:07 - man pages if you ever get stuck and just
11:10 - kind of play around with all the cool
11:12 - things that you can do but hopefully you
11:14 - guys found this overview of these
11:16 - commands useful keep practicing with
11:18 - these commands it's really one of those
11:20 - things that you wonder how you lived
11:22 - without it once you begin using these on
11:24 - a regular basis
11:25 - but if you all do have any questions
