00:01 - hey what's going on guys today I wanted
00:04 - to show you how to use custom web fonts
00:07 - on your website using the font scroll
00:09 - calm web font generator here I have a
00:13 - test website set up on my local server
00:15 - if we look at the folder for this
00:18 - website just has an index.html file and
00:21 - a CSS folder here inside the CSS folder
00:24 - we have a style about CSS file if we
00:28 - look at this file it just has a body
00:30 - element with a font family set to for
00:33 - Donna so the top one over to fonts
00:36 - broadcom and as you can see they have a
00:41 - lot of different fonts to choose from
00:44 - let's just choose the top one here the
00:47 - source and spring and when you find a
00:50 - font that you like be sure that you
00:52 - check the license to make sure that
00:54 - you're allowed to use this font on your
00:56 - website here we see that this font has
00:59 - the open font license so it's okay for
01:02 - us to use let's go ahead and download
01:05 - this ODF file
01:14 - and once that OTF file downloads let's
01:19 - go ahead and extract it
01:26 - okay so when we downloaded the source
01:29 - sans Pro it gave us all these different
01:32 - fonts it gave us the bold the italic the
01:34 - ligh for this tool tutorial we're just
01:37 - going to use the source sans program
01:39 - Euler ATF file so let's hop one back
01:43 - over to font squirrel and let's go to
01:46 - the web font generator
01:51 - now what this web font generator does is
01:54 - it takes that one OTF file and it
01:58 - generates everything that we're going to
02:00 - need in order to use that font on our
02:02 - website so let's go ahead and go to add
02:06 - fonts and we're gonna choose source sans
02:09 - Pro regular OTF and before we can
02:18 - download our kit we have to agree that
02:21 - we've read over the licensing and that
02:22 - we know that we're allowed to use this
02:25 - font on our website so go ahead and
02:26 - agree to that and once you do that then
02:29 - you have the option to download your kit
02:35 - now once your font kit is downloaded go
02:39 - to your downloads folder and let's
02:43 - extract that zip file okay now we can
02:52 - see all the files that that font
02:53 - generator created you can see we have an
02:55 - e OT file here svgt TF what these are
02:59 - are their different font files that are
03:02 - going to be used in different browsers
03:04 - for compatibility what we're going to
03:08 - want to do is copy all the files that
03:10 - that font Jenner created and we are
03:15 - going to paste these into our own
03:17 - website specifically in the CSS
03:21 - directory where our own CSS file lives
03:28 - okay now if you look at the style sheets
03:31 - CSS that the font generator created if
03:36 - we open that up
03:37 - we can see that it created the font face
03:40 - rule that we want to use in our own CSS
03:42 - file and this font face rule already has
03:45 - everything we need it has all the URLs
03:48 - to those font files so let's go ahead
03:51 - and copy this code and then let's open
03:58 - up our own CSS file and let's paste that
04:03 - at the top okay now if you look at this
04:09 - top line here this font family line this
04:12 - is the name that we're assigning to this
04:14 - font so if I copy this I can use this
04:19 - font now anywhere in my CSS file to
04:23 - assign that font to any of these
04:25 - elements so if I use that here at the
04:28 - body element now the body will use the
04:32 - source sans profile that we downloaded
04:34 - so let's go ahead and save that CSS file
04:38 - go back to our browser and see if
04:41 - everything worked so now let's go ahead
04:44 - and reload that okay so the new font
04:48 - worked the custom font work that we
04:50 - thought we wanted so that's one way to
04:54 - do custom fonts for your website there's
04:57 - a lot of different places to find these
04:59 - fonts font squirrel's one of them you
05:02 - can also go over here to google fonts
05:04 - and you can download the fonts from
05:09 - there and then run them through the web
05:11 - font generator as well and go through
05:13 - the exact same process hopefully this
