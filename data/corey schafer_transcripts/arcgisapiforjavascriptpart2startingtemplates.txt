00:01 - hey everybody how's it going uh this is
00:03 - going to be the next part in working
00:05 - with the rgis API for JavaScript uh when
00:08 - we finished with the first part we had a
00:11 - basic map over here that just has a very
00:14 - simple gray background and it doesn't
00:17 - have any functionality if we uh look
00:19 - over here at the script that we used we
00:21 - just have a gray bass map with a zoom
00:23 - set to five and we put in a sample
00:27 - location here just a an easy walkthrough
00:29 - that we took through from uh from their
00:31 - examples um but now when a lot of people
00:34 - get to this point they don't really know
00:35 - where to go from here uh they want to
00:37 - add some functionality to the map um but
00:40 - they you know don't really know how to
00:42 - do that you maybe want to have a
00:45 - navigation bar up here uh you want to
00:47 - have some different buttons uh that do
00:49 - different things maybe you want to have
00:52 - some buttons in here that switch between
00:54 - base Maps uh within your map so that you
00:57 - don't have to do it within the code um
00:59 - so you know you could go in and start
01:02 - adding in you know some buttons and some
01:03 - functionality but it might look bad and
01:06 - it might not work the way that you
01:07 - expect it to work um so what I would
01:10 - recommend is uh starting with a with a
01:14 - template with a starting template um the
01:17 - most popular starting template that
01:19 - people use is a framework called
01:21 - bootstrap and getting the bootstrap
01:24 - framework to work with the maps is a
01:28 - little difficult but luckily uh ezri has
01:32 - already done that for us if we go over
01:33 - here to
01:35 - Google and type in rgis
01:39 - bootstrap then the top link
01:43 - here is a link to one of their GitHub
01:47 - repository called bootstrap map JS um
01:50 - really quick I'm just going to go over
01:52 - here to
01:53 - EZ's uh page on GitHub and you can see
01:56 - that they have a a lot of code that they
01:59 - put out here
02:00 - um so if you work with rgis a lot I
02:03 - highly recommend that you bookmark this
02:05 - page it's uh you know something useful
02:06 - to check out from time to time and it's
02:08 - not only JavaScript you can see here
02:10 - they have um some Java some action
02:12 - script some C and some python um bunch
02:17 - of different things so uh it's extremely
02:19 - useful but if we go back over here to
02:21 - this bootstrap map
02:23 - JS they have a sample here that we can
02:26 - take a look at and you can see they have
02:28 - two samples one is dojo plus jQuery and
02:31 - another one is pure Dojo uh I prefer to
02:36 - have jQuery I think it's easy to work
02:38 - with um and you know it's fairly popular
02:41 - with uh with JavaScript so if we click
02:43 - on here then we can see we have our top
02:46 - navigation bar and we have a basic map
02:50 - um so this top navigation bar is already
02:54 - responsive um right out of the box and
02:56 - what I mean by responsive is that it
02:58 - looks good on um mostly all screen sizes
03:02 - so uh say that someone was browsing your
03:05 - map on their mobile phone um then
03:08 - there's a lot of text up here on this
03:10 - navigation bar and you see if we get
03:12 - down to a small screen size that when
03:15 - this text text can't fit anymore it pops
03:18 - into a hamburger menu that just slides
03:22 - down and you know it's really smooth and
03:24 - all that's built in to where we don't
03:26 - have to uh code all this stuff ourselves
03:28 - from scratch um so that's really nice um
03:32 - let's see they also have a grid layout
03:34 - here where if you wanted to have a
03:36 - sidebar on the right with your map on
03:39 - the left um that's already set up you
03:41 - can do a center map with a sidebar on
03:44 - the left and a sidebar on the right and
03:47 - last one you can do a sidebar on the
03:48 - left uh with a map on the right um this
03:53 - is pretty neat this uh web map example
03:55 - that they have here loads in a uh map
03:58 - from RGS on line and um it already has
04:01 - functionality buildin where you can
04:03 - click on the map and you know look
04:05 - through different features here they
04:07 - also have a legend that can be maximized
04:09 - and minimized over here um yeah so uh a
04:14 - lot of good examples right out of the
04:15 - box um if you look at the main page here
04:18 - they also have uh this quickart map JS
04:23 - and this is another set of templates and
04:26 - I'm going to show you the difference
04:27 - between um between between the two
04:30 - downloads so let me go ahead and close
04:32 - this page and let's go ahead and uh just
04:36 - jump into it and download both of these
04:39 - repositories and put them onto our local
04:41 - server so that we can start playing
04:42 - around with them if you are familiar
04:46 - with Git and GitHub then you can go
04:48 - ahead and clone these repositories onto
04:50 - your desktop uh but if you're not
04:52 - familiar or if you just want to download
04:53 - a zip file then you can go ahead and
04:55 - download zip download the zip file here
04:57 - too and it's uh you know it's uh the
04:59 - same thing
05:00 - um so let's go ahead and download both
05:02 - of
05:06 - these and I will extract both of these
05:11 - files and I'm going to go ahead and drag
05:14 - these over to my local web server um if
05:17 - you watched part one then uh you should
05:21 - already know how to have your web server
05:23 - set up um uh so that we can view our uh
05:27 - view our websites locally um um let me
05:30 - I'm going to go ahead and call this
05:31 - quick start map I'm going to call it um
05:35 - I already have a part one so I'm going
05:36 - to call this part uh
05:39 - 2A and I'm going to call this bootstrap
05:43 - map
05:45 - part to B and now I'm going to go ahead
05:48 - and drag these over to my local web
05:53 - server okay and let's see what these
05:55 - look like okay so this is part one you
05:59 - can see up here in the address bar I
06:00 - have Local Host 888 and it's in a folder
06:03 - called arjs JavaScript and in a folder
06:06 - called part one so I'm going to navigate
06:08 - over to part
06:12 - 2A
06:14 - and this is
06:16 - the uh quick start map JS repository and
06:20 - if I go to to B then we should
06:26 - see okay now we can see the directory
06:29 - listing for the second repository that
06:31 - we downloaded and now if you click here
06:33 - on demo then you can see it takes us
06:36 - back to the demo that we saw before
06:38 - online at um through this link here in
06:42 - their reposit in EZ's repository but now
06:45 - it's running on our local web server so
06:47 - you can see up here it's running on
06:49 - Local Host um so let's go back over here
06:53 - to let's go to the part 2A folder and
06:57 - this was the Quick Start map repository
07:01 - through through ezri um now what this is
07:04 - is this is just uh a lot of samples to
07:08 - that you can keep referring back to if
07:10 - you need to look at specific code or if
07:12 - you want to start with one of these
07:14 - samples then you can do that too it's um
07:16 - it's a way to get you um you know just
07:19 - uh to dive right into it uh and have
07:21 - some specific functionality right out of
07:23 - the box so for example say that you want
07:25 - to switch through base Maps um so let's
07:28 - just click on the first B Bas Max Bas
07:30 - Maps example here and you can see this
07:33 - looks a lot like the map that we
07:34 - finished with in part one with the gray
07:37 - base map um but now we have some
07:40 - functionality up here uh in this base
07:42 - Maps menu that lets us toggle through
07:45 - different base Maps um if we go back we
07:49 - can do they have a base Maps widget
07:52 - where they replace the text Bas maps
07:54 - with these images so that you can get a
07:56 - preview of what it'll look like um they
07:58 - have I'm not going to go through every
08:00 - single one of these you can download it
08:02 - and look through them all yourselves but
08:04 - uh they have a lot of cool example here
08:06 - examples here they have the geoc coding
08:09 - um they have it to where you can load a
08:11 - geojson file using their uh terraformer
08:15 - uh repository another repository that
08:17 - they have up on GitHub um so a lot of
08:21 - nice functionality that you can use
08:23 - right off the bat um down here they have
08:25 - an HTML 5 geolocation sample uh so if
08:29 - you're browser has geolocation turned on
08:32 - then we can click up here on the
08:35 - geolocation button and it should yep
08:38 - Zoom to our location um so these are a
08:41 - lot of nice uh templates to get you
08:44 - started uh using any specific
08:46 - functionality and you can um you can uh
08:51 - dive in here if we look at uh Sublime
08:55 - Text you can go in and look at all this
08:58 - code you can look at all the examples
09:00 - that they have and see um exactly how
09:03 - they do so for example um you know the
09:06 - Geo search they have all the code here
09:08 - that you can look through um the
09:11 - starting templates that I like to start
09:14 - out with is if we go
09:18 - to part 2B this is the one that we
09:21 - downloaded that has the demo that was uh
09:24 - the same online but instead of going to
09:27 - this demo folder um go down here to this
09:31 - templates folder and within the
09:33 - templates folder uh you have uh four
09:36 - different templates here to get you
09:37 - started if we click on full map
09:41 - template uh then we can see we have a
09:43 - navigation bar up here at the top uh we
09:46 - have a way to switch through base maps
09:49 - and we have uh two links here that um
09:52 - are just dead links right now but uh
09:55 - just uh to get you started um let's go
09:59 - back
10:00 - and look at some of the others we have a
10:02 - Geo search template here which is almost
10:04 - exactly the same as the full map
10:07 - template it's instead but instead of
10:09 - having a base Maps drop down it has a
10:11 - Geo search button here that um yeah you
10:14 - can search for uh certain things in the
10:17 - area and it also has some default uh
10:19 - click functionality here to look at some
10:22 - extra
10:22 - metadata um and we have two more uh the
10:27 - starter template the start starter
10:29 - templates uh very similar to uh the full
10:32 - map template also uh except yeah you'll
10:35 - notice that the map doesn't take up the
10:37 - entire bottom of the screen here it has
10:40 - a map title and a description that you
10:42 - can add in here um which is nice if
10:44 - you're making an online map and you want
10:46 - to you know put in some text to uh
10:49 - describe what your application's about
10:52 - then um this will be how you do it and
10:54 - any of these samples um let me pull this
10:56 - up in Sublime Text if we go down to part
10:58 - 2
10:59 - and templates and starter template any
11:02 - of these samples you can just open up
11:04 - the code and um and just start going
11:07 - through it and making modifications so
11:10 - uh say instead of project name I wanted
11:12 - this to be um you know awesome map and
11:17 - then
11:18 - um for instead of bootstrap starter
11:21 - template we could do my
11:24 - awesome map
11:26 - template and if we save that and
11:29 - reloaded over here on our local server
11:31 - you can see that the title up here
11:34 - changed awesome map and also our
11:36 - headlines changed here so um these can
11:39 - uh templates uh you can just jump right
11:42 - into and start making some changes
11:44 - quickly there's one last template that
11:46 - they give you here if I go out into the
11:49 - directory and go into this web map
11:52 - template this is just the um example
11:58 - that they have where you you can load in
11:59 - a map from art GS Online um so uh there
12:05 - and like the other examples there's a
12:08 - code that you can dig into here in
12:10 - Sublime Text and um and you can see
12:14 - exactly how they're doing that uh the
12:17 - template that I usually start off with
12:20 - is
12:22 - the full map template so let me go ahead
12:25 - and open this up again and let me go
12:28 - ahead and open over here in Sublime
12:34 - Text and I'll close down this other one
12:37 - okay now if we wanted to use one of
12:39 - these starting templates then we
12:41 - probably want to make a new separate
12:44 - project and then only bring in the code
12:47 - that we're going to use because there's
12:48 - a lot of extra code and we don't want
12:51 - all the templates in our own starting
12:54 - project uh so let's go ahead and walk
12:57 - through that really quickly um if I go
12:59 - over here to finder um within my local
13:02 - web server let's go ahead and make a new
13:04 - folder called um we'll just call this
13:08 - starter
13:09 - map and I'm going to open this up in a
13:11 - new
13:15 - tab okay so if I wanted to use one of
13:18 - these starter templates let me go ahead
13:19 - and open them up over here um we're
13:21 - going to need this Source folder so
13:25 - let's copy and paste this over um what
13:27 - that Source folder is is it has the
13:29 - bootstrap CSS and the bootstrap
13:32 - JavaScript um and let's go down here
13:36 - into the templates folder and so say for
13:40 - example I wanted to use the full map
13:42 - template let's open up the full map
13:43 - template and we can copy over the CSS
13:48 - and the
13:50 - HTML
13:52 - okay and
13:55 - now me close these down and um pulled up
13:59 - in Sublime here but now you'll notice if
14:03 - I
14:05 - um open up a new tab here with this new
14:09 - starter
14:13 - map it does not work and it doesn't work
14:17 - because uh from where we move stuff
14:19 - around we uh change the relative paths
14:23 - for a few of the things so let's go down
14:25 - to our starter map and let's open up the
14:27 - index.html file
14:29 - and now there's a few paths that are now
14:33 - different like for example um it's not
14:36 - in the uh our index file isn't in the
14:38 - templates folder anymore so we don't
14:40 - need to go up a few directories here um
14:44 - uh for this CSS stylesheet we can just
14:46 - um that's just going to be in source and
14:51 - CSS okay and let's see if there's
14:55 - another one
14:56 - here okay so here's another relative pth
14:59 - path that is no longer up a few
15:01 - directories anymore um so if we save
15:04 - that and then reload our map over here
15:06 - let's see if that works okay so now we
15:08 - have the map pulling up let's test the
15:10 - functionality and make sure that we can
15:11 - change these base Maps Okay so that's
15:14 - working well um now the only thing left
15:17 - to do if I was to start um with this
15:21 - template then like we did in our first
15:24 - tutorial um we want to separate out our
15:28 - main CS s and our main JavaScript into
15:33 - external files but um this tutorial is
15:36 - going on kind of long so I'm not going
15:37 - to walk through that I uh showed you how
15:40 - to do that in part one so if you want to
15:42 - know how to uh move your uh move this
15:46 - Javascript file and this starting CSS
15:50 - file here into an external CSS and
15:53 - JavaScript um uh files then uh you can
15:56 - just watch part one and check that out
15:59 - um so hopefully all this was clear if
16:02 - you guys have any questions uh don't
16:03 - hesitate to ask and um hopefully this
16:06 - was useful for you guys and thanks for
16:08 - watching
