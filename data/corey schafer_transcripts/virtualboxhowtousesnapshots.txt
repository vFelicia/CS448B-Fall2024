00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody so in
00:02 - the near future I'm going to be putting
00:03 - together some system administration
00:04 - videos and in those videos I'll be using
00:07 - some virtual machines within VirtualBox
00:09 - and in this video we'll be looking at
00:11 - how we can create and restore snapshots
00:13 - within VirtualBox
00:14 - so snapshots in VirtualBox allow us to
00:17 - save the state of our machines so that
00:19 - we can always restore the machine to the
00:20 - exact state in the future so it's
00:23 - extremely powerful because it allows us
00:24 - to quickly roll back changes without
00:26 - needing to do a complete reinstall and
00:28 - configuration from scratch so I've got
00:31 - my VirtualBox pulled up here and I
00:32 - currently have three virtual machines so
00:34 - one is a boom to desktop and the other
00:37 - is Kali Linux and the last one here is
00:39 - another oven to desktop machine and that
00:42 - is a completely fresh install that we'll
00:45 - use to create some snapshots and I do
00:47 - have separate videos on installing the
00:49 - operating systems within VirtualBox if
00:51 - you'd like to see how that was done now
00:54 - when we have one of these top virtual
00:56 - machines here selected we can see that
00:58 - we have this snapshots tab over here to
01:00 - the right so if we click on this you can
01:03 - see that I have a few snapshots here
01:05 - already so I took an initial snapshot
01:07 - right after the initial installation and
01:09 - another snapshot after I installed guest
01:13 - additions and the last snapshot I took
01:15 - here was after I changed some network
01:18 - settings now snapshots are going to
01:20 - allow me to go back and forth between
01:21 - these safe states so if I was to screw
01:23 - something up while changing those
01:25 - Network settings then I could just
01:27 - revert back to the snapshot of the state
01:29 - of the Machine right after I installed
01:31 - guest additions and it would be like
01:33 - those Network setting changes never
01:35 - happened so I've got a fresh install of
01:37 - a boon to desktop here that doesn't have
01:39 - any snapshots of the Machine yet so all
01:42 - I've done on this machine so far is
01:44 - install the operating system and then
01:46 - powered down the machine so I always
01:48 - like to create a snapshot of my virtual
01:50 - machines at this initial state because
01:52 - if I screw something up and want to go
01:53 - back to the initial and install state
01:55 - then I don't want to have to reinstall
01:57 - the entire operating system from scratch
01:59 - so it's a lot easier just restore the
02:01 - snapshot of that initial installation
02:03 - state so to take the snapshot it's
02:06 - really as simple as selecting the
02:08 - virtual machine opening up that
02:09 - snapshots tab and then clicking this
02:12 - camera on
02:13 - Khanh up here that says take a snapshot
02:15 - so when we click that it will ask us to
02:18 - give our snapshot a name and some
02:20 - details as to what the snapshot contains
02:22 - so it's nice to be as detailed as
02:24 - possible but I'm just going to fill this
02:26 - in here by saying initial install and
02:29 - I'll do that both for the snapshot name
02:33 - and the details and then I'll click OK
02:35 - now once we've taken that snapshot then
02:38 - we can revert this machine back to that
02:40 - initial State at any point by clicking
02:43 - on the snapshot and then up here we can
02:45 - choose this is restore the snapshot this
02:48 - is delete and this opens up details and
02:51 - you can also right-click on these as
02:52 - well and you can see that we have
02:54 - restore delete and show details so you
02:56 - can see here that our snapshot has this
02:58 - little red square here at the bottom
03:00 - right of this icon and that just means
03:03 - that the snapshot was taking while the
03:04 - machine was offline so if you take a
03:06 - snapshot of a running machine then that
03:09 - icon will be different and we'll take a
03:11 - look at that here in just a minute but
03:13 - for now let's go ahead and make a few
03:15 - changes to the fresh install of this
03:17 - virtual machine and take a few more
03:19 - snapshots so I'm going to go ahead and
03:21 - fire this machine up so now that we have
03:26 - this virtual machine running I'm going
03:28 - to go ahead and maximize this and you
03:31 - can see that we don't have guest
03:32 - additions installed because if we had
03:34 - guest additions installed then we'd be
03:36 - able to view this in full screen so
03:38 - let's go ahead and install these really
03:40 - quick so I'm going to go ahead and put
03:41 - my password here now I showed these
03:44 - steps in a separate video where we walk
03:45 - through this installation but basically
03:47 - we're just going to click on devices up
03:50 - here at the top and install guest
03:52 - additions CD and now we just need to
03:54 - walk through these steps I'm going to
03:56 - click run and then it's probably going
03:58 - to ask us for a password here and now
04:00 - we'll just let this install so once
04:04 - that's finished installing I'll go ahead
04:05 - and hit enter there and now I'll shut
04:08 - this computer down or this machine down
04:11 - for those changes to take effect so I'll
04:13 - shut this down now while I'm powered
04:16 - down here we can see that it says that
04:17 - our current state has changed now I'm
04:19 - going to go ahead and create a new
04:21 - snapshot at this point since we've
04:22 - installed guest additions so I'll create
04:25 - a new snapshot
04:26 - for the name and the description I'll
04:29 - just say installed guest additions and
04:33 - and copy this and paste this in here so
04:38 - now we have two snapshots so notice that
04:40 - it makes a little tree here so basically
04:43 - this is saying that all the changes we
04:45 - made up to this point can be traced back
04:47 - down this tree but we can also have
04:50 - separate branches of these trees so for
04:52 - example I'm going to power up this
04:54 - machine again and this time I'll install
04:57 - an Apache web server so when the machine
05:01 - powers up here we can see that it is in
05:02 - full-screen so we do have those guest
05:05 - additions installed so now I'm going to
05:08 - pull up my terminal once this desktop
05:10 - runs so we'll go up here and search for
05:14 - the terminal and we can tell if a patchy
05:18 - is installed by typing in service Apache
05:21 - to status and if we hit enter then we
05:25 - can see that that wasn't found so I'm
05:27 - going to install it by saying sudo
05:29 - apt-get install apache2 and type in the
05:35 - sudo password
05:38 - so now after that installation finished
05:41 - we can rerun that status command again
05:45 - and if we run that then we can see that
05:47 - now Apache is installed so now I'm going
05:49 - to power down the machine here real
05:51 - quick now that Apache is installed so
05:57 - with that machine powered down I'm going
05:58 - to create another snapshot here and now
06:01 - for the name and for the description I'm
06:04 - going to put installed Apache for both
06:06 - of these okay so now here's where we can
06:10 - do something a little interesting so I'm
06:12 - going to revert back to before I
06:13 - installed Apache so I'm going to restore
06:16 - this snapshot right after we installed
06:19 - it guest additions so to do that I can
06:21 - just click on the snapshot and we can
06:23 - either restore by clicking this button
06:25 - here or we can right click and click
06:28 - restore so then it asks you if you're
06:30 - sure so I'll say yes that I want to
06:32 - restore to that point and now we can see
06:34 - that our current state is down here
06:36 - beside the Apache snapshot but it's not
06:38 - derived from that snapshot so if we spin
06:42 - up our machine now so I'll just log back
06:47 - in here really fast and then again we'll
06:50 - go ahead and open up that terminal so
06:56 - now just like before let's check and see
06:58 - if Apache is installed so we'll say
07:00 - service Apache - and then we'll do a
07:04 - status on that so we can see that that
07:06 - isn't found because we restored the
07:08 - snapshot before we installed that so now
07:11 - let's install nginx so we can install
07:14 - nginx by saying sudo apt-get install and
07:18 - engine X and put on our password
07:23 - and now we can check to make sure that
07:25 - was installed by typing service and this
07:27 - time we'll search for Engine X and then
07:29 - status and we can see that that was
07:31 - installed successfully so now I'm going
07:33 - to power down the machine here one more
07:35 - time so now with that machine powered
07:40 - down I'm going to create a snapshot of
07:42 - this engine X installation also but
07:44 - there's one quick thing that I want to
07:46 - show you here first so you see how it
07:48 - says that our current state is changed
07:50 - well if we try to restore a previous
07:52 - snapshot while our current state has
07:54 - changed then I'll ask us if we want to
07:56 - first take a snapshot of that change
07:58 - State so to show you this I'll go ahead
08:01 - and try to restore this earlier snapshot
08:03 - while we're in this change State so I
08:06 - will click on restore snapshot for this
08:08 - install guest additions and you can see
08:10 - that since we are in that change state
08:12 - it pops up a warning here that says that
08:14 - you can create a snapshot of the current
08:16 - state first and if we don't then our
08:18 - changes will be lost forever and it
08:21 - defaults to having this selected so that
08:23 - we will create that snapshot now a lot
08:26 - of the time when I'm reverting back to a
08:28 - previous snapshot it's usually because I
08:31 - want to get rid of the current state of
08:32 - my machine because I've messed something
08:34 - up so usually I uncheck this so that I
08:38 - don't create a new snapshot but in this
08:40 - case I want to take that snapshot of the
08:42 - engine X installation so I'll go ahead
08:44 - and leave that checked and I'll click
08:47 - restore and so now it pops up the
08:50 - details of that snapshot that we want to
08:52 - create so for this one I'll just say
08:55 - installed engine X and for the
08:59 - description there's a typo there but
09:00 - that's not a big deal and for the
09:02 - description I will say the same thing so
09:06 - now we have two snapshots branching off
09:08 - of our guest additions snapshot now one
09:11 - has Apache installed and the other one
09:13 - has nginx installed so we can see how
09:16 - useful this is so instead of having
09:18 - multiple virtual machines all with
09:20 - different setups we instead have one
09:22 - virtual machine that we can use to test
09:24 - multiple different setups and switching
09:27 - back and forth between these is just as
09:28 - easy as clicking on a snapshot and
09:31 - clicking restore so now that we've
09:35 - restored that snapshot if
09:36 - we fire up our machine then we'll have a
09:38 - machine that has nginx installed and not
09:42 - Apache ok so what are these snapshots
09:45 - actually saving about our machine state
09:48 - so I have the VirtualBox documentation
09:51 - about snapshots pulled up here so I'm
09:52 - going to go ahead and maximize this and
09:55 - I'm going to scroll down here to
09:57 - snapshot contents now we can see here
10:00 - that there are basically three different
10:01 - bullet points as to what the snapshot
10:04 - contents contain so in short the
10:07 - snapshots saved for the first bullet
10:09 - point here they save a complete copy of
10:12 - the VM settings including the hardware
10:15 - configuration and the second bullet
10:17 - point here and you can read these on
10:20 - your own I'm just kind of paraphrasing
10:21 - the second bullet point basically says
10:23 - that it also saves the complete state of
10:26 - all virtual disk and this basically
10:28 - means that all the changes that had been
10:30 - made to the disk will be reverted back
10:33 - to the exact state of that snapshot so
10:36 - any files that were created since the
10:38 - snapshot will disappear files that were
10:40 - deleted will be restored and files that
10:42 - were modified will be reverted to what
10:44 - they were and this last point point here
10:47 - says that if you take a snapshot while
10:49 - the machine is running the memory state
10:52 - of the machine is also saved so when you
10:54 - restored the snapshot the execution will
10:57 - resume at exactly the point when the
10:59 - snapshot was taken so the memory state
11:01 - file can be as large as the memory size
11:03 - of the virtual machine itself and it
11:06 - says here that that can occupy a lot of
11:09 - this space so if you imagine you have a
11:12 - few gigs loaded into memory and save
11:14 - that machine state then it's going to
11:16 - dump all of that into a file and that
11:19 - can be pretty large so that last bullet
11:21 - point is why I generally try to avoid
11:23 - taking snapshots of machines while
11:25 - they're running so my main use case for
11:27 - snapshots is to be able to go back and
11:30 - forth between changes and settings or
11:32 - back and forth between software installs
11:34 - and things like that but the snapshot of
11:37 - a running machine could be useful if you
11:39 - really need it so let's go ahead and see
11:41 - what that would look like
11:42 - so I'll just log in to our machine here
11:46 - so let's say that you're working within
11:48 - your virtual machine
11:50 - and you have a lot of work pulled up and
11:52 - for some reason you have to restart your
11:54 - host machine or something like that so
11:56 - within this document here I'm just going
12:00 - to type in important document or we
12:02 - could even be in terminal and be half
12:05 - way through a bunch of commands and we
12:07 - have to shut down our virtual machine so
12:09 - let's say that I want to save the exact
12:11 - state of this machine so to do this we
12:14 - can come up here to machine and if we
12:16 - click on a machine then we can go to
12:18 - take snapshot and now for the name and
12:22 - the description here I'll just say
12:24 - working and working and then we'll click
12:27 - ok so now that saved the state of our
12:31 - running machine so now I'm going to
12:33 - power down this virtual machine here and
12:35 - just shut this down without saving
12:37 - anything now if I minimize this and open
12:41 - back up Virtual Box here so we can see
12:44 - that under our nginx snapshot we have a
12:47 - working snapshot and the icon is a green
12:50 - play button which means that this
12:52 - machine was running when we took the
12:54 - snapshot so if we restore this snapshot
12:57 - and I'm just going to uncheck to create
13:00 - a new snapshot from the current state so
13:03 - now we've restored that working snapshot
13:05 - now I'm going to fire this machine back
13:07 - up and you can see it comes back up with
13:12 - everything that we had open and our
13:13 - unsaved changes are still in our
13:15 - document so that's pretty cool but
13:17 - remember that the snapshots of these
13:19 - running machines do take up a lot more
13:22 - space so I hardly ever use them so I
13:24 - usually have time to power down before I
13:27 - take any snapshots that I need but the
13:29 - feature is there if you need it ok so
13:31 - now we can just power this down for the
13:34 - last time ok so I think that is going to
13:37 - do it for this video so I hope that you
13:39 - learned a lot about how you can use
13:40 - snapshots within your virtual machines
13:42 - so when I first started using VirtualBox
13:45 - I didn't really know how to properly use
13:47 - these snapshots so I would always be
13:49 - scrapping entire machines when I made
13:52 - mistakes and reinstalling the entire
13:53 - operating system from scratch but
13:56 - learning how to use these snapshots has
13:57 - really saved me a lot of time and hassle
13:59 - and hopefully it'll do the same for you
14:01 - but if you do have any questions about
14:03 - what we covered in this video
14:04 - then feel free to ask in the comment
14:06 - section below and I'll do my best to
14:07 - answer those and if you enjoy these
14:09 - tutorials and would like to support them
