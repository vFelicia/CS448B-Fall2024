00:00 - hey how's it going guys i want to show
00:02 - you a
00:03 - quick tip and how you can quickly
00:05 - generate your icons for your favicon uh
00:10 - your apple device your android device
00:12 - and
00:13 - you know all these different devices all
00:14 - in one place i have a test website
00:17 - running on my local server here this is
00:20 - just a
00:21 - yeoman website right out of the box and
00:24 - the website that i'm gonna be using to
00:26 - generate all my icons is this website
00:29 - real favicon generator.net
00:33 - i really like this website i'm glad that
00:35 - i found it i used to create all my icons
00:38 - from scratch and then
00:41 - then i would have to resize all of them
00:43 - for all the different devices and then
00:45 - hand write all the code and put that
00:47 - into the header of my website but since
00:49 - i've found this website it makes all
00:51 - that really easily so let's go ahead and
00:53 - get started with this
00:55 - now you do already have to have your
00:57 - picture that you want to use for your
00:59 - website
01:00 - this website isn't for that it's not for
01:03 - creating the picture it's for
01:05 - resizing the picture and giving you the
01:07 - code to use that
01:09 - once it generates those for you
01:11 - so you need to have a picture first over
01:13 - here on my desktop
01:15 - i have one here called icon.png
01:18 - and you can see down here before you
01:19 - select your picture
01:21 - it says that you want to submit a square
01:22 - picture at least 70 by 70 and it should
01:25 - be at least 260 by 260 for optimal
01:28 - results
01:29 - this picture i have here for my website
01:31 - is i believe 800 by 800 so it is plenty
01:34 - big
01:36 - so i'm going to click click on select
01:39 - your fav icon picture
01:42 - and then i'm going to navigate over here
01:44 - to my desktop then i'm going to select
01:46 - this icon.png
01:48 - and open that
01:50 - and once that's finished generating
01:52 - it'll give you a bunch of different
01:53 - options here i usually just leave these
01:55 - as is but you can play with these if you
01:57 - want
01:58 - you can mess around with some of the
02:00 - colors uh some of the margin sizes here
02:02 - if you look up here at the picture
02:05 - you can change the margin between your
02:06 - pictures but like i said i usually just
02:08 - leave these as the defaults
02:11 - one that i usually change is for this
02:13 - windows 8 tile i usually try to pick a
02:15 - picture or an image
02:18 - a background color that looks a little
02:20 - bit better with my icon here and then
02:22 - you can even
02:23 - choose your own but uh i'm not gonna
02:25 - fuss too much with this right now i'll
02:28 - just uh
02:29 - pick black there and or this dark blue
02:32 - and then kind of move on but you can
02:33 - match that closer to your icon if you
02:35 - want
02:36 - but yeah there's a lot of different
02:38 - options here i usually just leave these
02:40 - as default and then once you have all
02:43 - that set then you can go down here and
02:45 - finalize and generate your favicons and
02:48 - your html code
02:50 - and once that finishes it does a couple
02:52 - of things here so
02:54 - it has your downloadable package of your
02:57 - favicons and your other icons it also
02:59 - has all this html code here and down
03:02 - here you can kind of see what the icons
03:04 - look like that it generated for you
03:06 - so first i'm going to go ahead and
03:08 - download this package
03:10 - and let's go ahead and unzip that
03:17 - and now you can see why this tool would
03:18 - be so useful because uh all of these
03:21 - images here um are four different
03:23 - devices you have your apple touch
03:24 - devices and all the different sizes that
03:26 - you're supposed to have for that you
03:27 - have your androids uh your favicons and
03:31 - things like that so to make all those
03:33 - from scratch
03:34 - from yourself and resizing all those
03:36 - would kind of be a hassle but with this
03:38 - just does it all in the one nice sip
03:40 - folder and you're good to go
03:42 - so i'm going to go ahead and copy all of
03:44 - these
03:46 - and copy 28 items and then i'm going to
03:48 - open up
03:49 - my
03:51 - test website here and you can see up
03:52 - here in the top
03:54 - left that i don't have a favicon yet so
03:58 - let's go ahead and paste
04:01 - all those into
04:03 - the root of the website
04:05 - and then if we go back to where it
04:07 - generated our html we can copy this to
04:10 - the clipboard now it says it's copied
04:12 - and if i open up my test website here
04:15 - then i can go and paste this
04:18 - into my top of my index.html file
04:23 - and that's all the code that it
04:24 - generated for me and i will tab that
04:26 - over
04:27 - and save that
04:30 - and if you're running a basic website
04:32 - that should be all that you have to do
04:34 - you should be able to save that file and
04:36 - then those favicons will show up
04:38 - i'm running a yeoman website here so
04:41 - i'm just going to do a
04:43 - grunt build to build that website and
04:47 - it'll quickly run through those
04:50 - and now that that build all my files i
04:52 - should be able to go over here to my
04:54 - test website and reload this
04:57 - uh so actually since i'm running this
05:00 - from my local web server
05:01 - this relative path to these images is
05:04 - going to be
05:05 - a little bit different usually you will
05:06 - have these at the root of your website
05:08 - most likely when you put them in your
05:10 - live website they'll be at the root
05:12 - but just for the sake of demonstration
05:13 - here i'm going to
05:16 - change these to where
05:20 - to where it can find this in the same
05:22 - folder
05:23 - that my website lives and now let me
05:26 - rerun this grump build
05:28 - and now let's see if it can find those
05:31 - icons
05:32 - okay so now you can see here that the
05:35 - favicon is showing up in my web browser
05:38 - if you know if this was a live website
05:42 - and you dropped that code in there in
05:43 - those images then
05:45 - you would also you know if you saved
05:47 - that website to your iphone then that
05:49 - icon would pop up it would save on your
05:52 - android and all those devices that's
05:54 - what that website does for you it
05:55 - creates
05:56 - all those icons for your site's brand
06:00 - and
06:01 - creates those to where they're
06:03 - accessible on all those devices
06:06 - and one last quick thing about this
06:08 - website if i go back to the main page
06:09 - here
06:10 - once you've dropped in all your icons
06:12 - and updated all your code uh to point to
06:15 - those icons then you want to go down
06:17 - here to your uh to this check your
06:20 - favicon here and it'll give you
06:23 - a little box here to type in your
06:25 - website and you can also say if your
06:27 - favicon isn't in the root directory of
06:29 - your website and just tell it that uh
06:32 - you know where to look um but in my case
06:35 - uh if i go to my personal website here
06:38 - coreyms.com
06:40 - and my favicons and all my icons are in
06:43 - the root of my website so then if i
06:45 - click this check button here it's going
06:48 - to go out and check your website and
06:50 - it's going to make sure that it can find
06:51 - all those icons and that except that
06:54 - those are accessible from all the
06:55 - different devices
06:57 - so you can see all these are in the
06:59 - green here so
07:00 - it's and it shows you a preview too of
07:02 - what each one of them looks like so on
07:03 - the desktop uh here's what it looks like
07:05 - in your browser this is the android ios
07:08 - windows 8 and then it also gives you
07:11 - all kinds of information here saying
07:13 - that you you know you have the right
07:14 - sizes that you have
07:16 - the right
07:18 - file formats the png's
07:20 - and things like that so you know it's
07:22 - really useful
07:24 - i used to do all this on my own it took
07:26 - a lot of time for
07:28 - not that big of a payoff but you know
07:30 - for this you can make a quick icon drop
07:33 - it into this website get all your icons
07:35 - generated get all the code for it drop
07:38 - those in and you're good to go for just
07:40 - about any device that you can think of
07:42 - so i hope this tip was useful for you
07:44 - guys you should definitely go and check
07:46 - out this website
07:48 - you know if you have any questions just
