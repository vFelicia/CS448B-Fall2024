00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to install Kali Linux on VirtualBox
00:05 - Kali Linux is a distribution designed
00:07 - for penetration testing hacking
00:10 - forensics and things like that so
00:12 - getting this distribution installed
00:13 - within VirtualBox will be a good
00:15 - starting point for us to dig further
00:17 - into some of these features in future
00:19 - videos so first we'll need to download
00:21 - and install VirtualBox now this is
00:23 - pretty straightforward so I'm not gonna
00:24 - go into too much detail here if you just
00:27 - do a quick search on Google for
00:29 - VirtualBox then it should take you to
00:30 - the downloads page and that's here at
00:32 - virtualbox.org so from here you can
00:36 - choose your operating system and walk
00:37 - through that installation so for example
00:39 - I'm on a Mac so I would choose this OS X
00:42 - download here so I already have
00:44 - VirtualBox installed so I'm not gonna
00:45 - walk through that but it's just a simple
00:47 - step-by-step process that you click
00:49 - through just like installing any other
00:51 - software so after you get that installed
00:53 - when you pull it up it should look
00:55 - something like this
00:57 - so now that we have VirtualBox installed
00:59 - we're gonna need to download the Kali
01:01 - Linux ISO file and we can find this on
01:04 - the kali linux downloads page and also a
01:08 - quick google search of that should take
01:10 - you to this downloads page so once we're
01:13 - on this page we can go ahead and
01:14 - download the ISO file so I'm going to
01:16 - grab this Kali Linux 64-bit ISO file so
01:20 - when I click on this is sure to go ahead
01:22 - and begin the installation and you can
01:24 - see that this is a large file this is
01:26 - 2.7 gigabytes that it's going to
01:30 - download here so I'm going to go ahead
01:31 - and fast forward until this download is
01:33 - complete okay so once that is downloaded
01:37 - let's go ahead and minimize our browser
01:39 - here and pull up VirtualBox so now we're
01:42 - ready to create our virtual machine so
01:44 - let's go ahead and choose new here and
01:47 - let's call this machine kali linux and
01:50 - we can leave the type at linux and for
01:53 - the version let's choose Debian 64-bit
01:56 - and now we're not going to go into too
01:59 - much detail here with some of these
02:00 - setup options basically we're just
02:02 - saying how much memory and disk space we
02:04 - want allocated to our machine and this
02:07 - depends on your computer but you're
02:08 - usually safe staying within these green
02:10 - sections here so for the
02:13 - I'm gonna do 4096 megabytes which is
02:17 - four gigs and I'm gonna leave the
02:19 - default there and the default for the
02:22 - VirtualBox disk image they're
02:25 - dynamically allocated is fun and for
02:28 - this section here I'm actually going to
02:31 - bump the size of this hard disk up to 20
02:34 - gigabytes Callie recommends on there
02:37 - download page that you have a minimum of
02:39 - 10 and you can get by with allocating
02:41 - that but I'm gonna go ahead and do 20
02:44 - here okay so now the virtual machine is
02:48 - created but there's one more setting I'm
02:50 - going to change before we install Kali
02:52 - so if we go to the settings here then we
02:56 - can change some of the values that we
02:58 - just set but there's also a lot of other
03:01 - customizations that we can make so one
03:03 - change that I'm going to make here is
03:05 - within the display tab for the video
03:08 - memory I want to go ahead and bump this
03:10 - up all the way and this will just
03:13 - improve our performance when we start
03:15 - the virtual machine so now let's go
03:17 - ahead and save that okay so now we're
03:20 - ready to actually install Kali Linux so
03:22 - we install this using the ISO file that
03:25 - we downloaded a little bit ago so to do
03:27 - this we can select our ISO by going down
03:30 - here to storage and clicking this empty
03:33 - optical drive and then we can go to
03:35 - choose image and now we navigate to
03:38 - where we downloaded that ISO file so I'm
03:41 - already here in my downloads folder so
03:43 - I'm just gonna choose Kali Linux and
03:45 - open that so now I'm just going to go
03:47 - ahead and start this machine and it
03:49 - should take us to where we can install
03:51 - the operating system for the
03:52 - installation method here I'm just gonna
03:54 - choose graphical install okay now we can
03:57 - just walk through this setup and a lot
03:59 - of these are going to stay at the
04:01 - defaults okay I'm just going to leave
04:05 - that for the hostname I'm going to leave
04:07 - the domain name blank for now okay now
04:10 - we can type in a root password and you
04:12 - have to remember this for when you log
04:15 - in and here I'm going to go ahead and
04:18 - choose Mountain time so since this is a
04:22 - new install we're going to go ahead and
04:23 - do the entire disk
04:28 - okay and at this point we can go ahead
04:30 - and choose yes to write these changes to
04:32 - the disk now this may take a second here
04:35 - so I'm going to go ahead and fast
04:36 - forward until this is finished
04:37 - installing okay well you can just leave
04:42 - the default there and I'm gonna leave
04:45 - that blank okay I'm going to leave the
04:49 - default there and I'm gonna go ahead and
04:51 - select that and continue and now you can
04:55 - see here that it is finishing the
04:56 - installation okay so now it says that
04:59 - our installation is complete so let's go
05:00 - ahead and continue okay so once that is
05:08 - finished installing that it should come
05:09 - here to this login screen so we can just
05:12 - login with the root user and we can use
05:16 - the password that we created whenever we
05:20 - ran through the installation okay so now
05:23 - we have a fresh install of a Kali
05:28 - desktop but we're not quite done so one
05:31 - thing that you're going to want to do is
05:33 - to install guest additions software so
05:36 - guest additions software will fix the
05:39 - display settings so that you can use
05:41 - Linux in full screen and it'll allow you
05:43 - to share directories between your host
05:45 - computer and the VM and it'll also allow
05:48 - you to share your clipboard which means
05:50 - you'll be able to copy and paste back
05:51 - and forth between your host computer and
05:53 - the virtual machine so for example right
05:55 - now if I make this full screen then you
05:59 - can see that it doesn't take up as much
06:00 - of the screen as we would like and it
06:03 - has all this wasted space that it could
06:05 - be using and guest additions will fix
06:08 - this now if you watch my video on
06:10 - installing Ubuntu and VirtualBox then
06:13 - you would know that you could just come
06:15 - up here to devices and do insert guest
06:18 - additions CD image and it's super simple
06:21 - but with Kali that doesn't exactly work
06:23 - and if you search for installing guest
06:27 - additions for Kali and their own
06:30 - documentation they have the preferred
06:33 - method for how they would like you to do
06:34 - it so you can see here that it says to
06:36 - start your Kali Linux virtual
06:38 - Jeane open a terminal window and use
06:41 - these following commands so what we're
06:44 - gonna do is go ahead and open up
06:45 - terminal and we're not gonna be able to
06:47 - copy and paste back and forth between
06:50 - our host and our virtual machine yet so
06:52 - I'm just gonna go ahead and type these
06:54 - out so I'm gonna do an act get update
06:56 - and once that's finished I'm going to do
06:58 - and apt-get install and we want to
07:02 - install with a dash Y option and we will
07:06 - do VirtualBox - guest - X 11 okay so
07:13 - once that's finished installing then we
07:15 - can go ahead and type in reboot us to
07:18 - allow those changes to take place okay
07:22 - so now I'm going to go ahead and
07:23 - minimize my browser here and maximize
07:26 - that and we can go ahead and log back in
07:29 - with root okay so once that's done now
07:34 - you can see that when we're in
07:35 - full-screen mode that the VM uses all of
07:38 - the space that it didn't use up before
07:40 - and if we go to view here then you can
07:43 - see that it is set to auto-resize guest
07:45 - display' so we do have those guest
07:48 - additions installed and working ok so
07:51 - now you should be good to go so you have
07:53 - a working fresh installation of Cali up
07:55 - and running and if you ever want to
07:57 - follow along with any of my command line
07:59 - tutorials then you could just come in
08:01 - here and open up the terminal and you
08:03 - could just start typing in commands and
08:07 - trying things out okay so I think that's
08:09 - gonna do it for this video if you have
08:11 - any questions and feel free to ask in
08:13 - the comment section below and I'll do my
08:14 - best to answer those if you enjoy these
08:16 - tutorials and would like to support them
