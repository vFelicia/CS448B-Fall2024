00:00 - hey what's going on guys I want to make
00:02 - a quick video here and show you how to
00:04 - add folder Stacks to your dock um so if
00:08 - you have a lot of applications here that
00:10 - are cluttering up your dock it's nice to
00:13 - organize them all into one place using
00:16 - these folder Stacks um now the way that
00:19 - you do this is that you group all of
00:20 - your applications into a single folder
00:23 - and then you just draag it drag it down
00:25 - to the dock uh but there's one little
00:28 - caveat here is that there's been some
00:31 - people online who have said that
00:33 - whenever they uh move any applications
00:36 - out of their applications folder or
00:39 - group them into a folder um then
00:42 - sometimes it messes with the updates of
00:44 - the application or um some websites
00:47 - won't recognize that the application's
00:49 - already installed so you really don't
00:51 - want to move applications out of your
00:54 - applications folder if that's the
00:55 - default place where it expects it to be
00:58 - um instead what I like to do is within
01:01 - my home directory uh I
01:05 - have this folder here called doc
01:08 - stacks and so for example if I made a
01:11 - new folder here and just called
01:14 - this text
01:17 - editors then if
01:19 - I go back to my
01:23 - applications instead of moving the
01:25 - actual application itself so say for
01:28 - example within this folder I wanted um
01:31 - atom brackets and uh let's do the new
01:35 - Sublime text instead of moving these out
01:38 - of the applications folder uh let's
01:40 - create an alias and the way that you can
01:42 - do an alias you can either uh right
01:45 - click and create an alias that way or
01:47 - you can hit uh command option and then
01:50 - drag and it will automatically create
01:53 - the Alias um so you can see here these
01:55 - little arrows at the bottom left uh we
01:57 - know that they are an alias of the file
01:59 - and not the file itself and we can see
02:01 - over here in the applications that our
02:04 - files are still there so if we go back
02:08 - then we can now drag this text editors
02:10 - folder down into our Doc and we'll just
02:13 - put it right there and now you can see
02:16 - that we have this folder stack here on
02:18 - our dock um so if I close these
02:22 - down um now I'm able to take these
02:25 - applications and uh just remove them
02:30 - from my Dock and now it saves a lot of
02:32 - space because now I have them here in
02:34 - one place instead of uh cluttering up my
02:37 - dock so I hope this quick tip was useful
02:40 - for you guys if you have any questions
02:42 - feel free to ask in the comments uh be
02:44 - sure to subscribe for future tips and
02:46 - tutorials and thanks for watching
