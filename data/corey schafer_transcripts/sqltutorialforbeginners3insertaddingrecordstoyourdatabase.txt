00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video we will start populating our table
00:04 - with some records so if you remember in
00:06 - the last video we created our table
00:08 - called people and we populated this
00:12 - table with two fields ID which is an
00:15 - integer and name which is a variable
00:18 - character string of a max of 255
00:22 - characters so now let's actually start
00:24 - adding records to this table now there
00:28 - are a few different ways in which we can
00:30 - write our insert statement to achieve
00:32 - this so first let's just do an insert
00:35 - into and then the name of our table
00:38 - which is people so insert into people
00:41 - and let's just do values of 1 and Cori
00:49 - so 1 will be our ID Cori will be the
00:52 - name let's go ahead and run that query
00:54 - and if we look at the data table and
00:57 - refresh this then you can see that we
01:00 - have an ID of 1 and a name of Cori that
01:03 - was added to our table now this is a row
01:05 - in our table this is a record so now
01:08 - let's go ahead and add a another record
01:11 - to our database so let's do an ID of 2
01:13 - and a name of Travis so let's go ahead
01:17 - and run that query and look at our data
01:19 - and refresh it and you can see that now
01:21 - we have an ID of 2 and the name of
01:23 - Travis now we can also specify the exact
01:26 - fields that we want to populate within
01:28 - our table so for example here right now
01:31 - I'm running insert into people values -
01:34 - and then the name the ID and then the
01:36 - name but we can specify the exact fields
01:39 - right here after the table name so if I
01:42 - type in ID and name then these are going
01:45 - to match up with the values that I pass
01:47 - in so 2 is going to get passed in as the
01:49 - ID Travis will get passed in as the name
01:52 - so right here if I was to change this to
01:54 - 3 and then Dave and then ran this query
01:58 - if we look back at our data and refresh
02:01 - that then now we have another record in
02:03 - our database with the information that
02:04 - we inserted but you can also switch
02:08 - these around to specify whatever order
02:11 - that you want so that's one advantage to
02:13 - doing it this
02:13 - way so instead of ID and name I could do
02:16 - name and ID and then in my values I have
02:20 - to change these accordingly so I can do
02:22 - a name of Bronx and I can give that an
02:25 - ID of 4 so if I run that then we go back
02:30 - to our data even though these were out
02:33 - of order since we specified the order
02:35 - here if we refresh that we can see that
02:37 - we have an idea for and the name of
02:40 - Bronx now the values that we insert into
02:43 - our table they have to match the values
02:45 - that we specified for our fields so for
02:48 - example if I was accidentally to mix
02:50 - these up and I was to do a name of
02:52 - quarry and an ID of 5 but then the order
02:56 - was ID and then name so what's going to
03:01 - happen here is it's going to try to
03:02 - insert quarry as the ID and 5 as the
03:06 - name now if I run this you can see that
03:09 - I get a syntax error so you can see that
03:12 - this error says invalid input syntax for
03:14 - integer and we were passing quarry as an
03:18 - integer and it didn't like that and it
03:20 - even gives us the statement here and if
03:22 - it was a longer statement it would be
03:23 - useful to know which line that was on so
03:25 - now it's not like that populated our
03:28 - database with bad data because since it
03:31 - was an error it never even got added you
03:33 - can see that there's no ID of 5 here or
03:35 - name of 5 nothing got added in
03:37 - incorrectly so if I switch these back
03:41 - around and I do the ID of 5 and then the
03:46 - name as quarry that's what we did before
03:48 - so I can run that query you can see this
03:50 - time we got no air and if i refresh our
03:53 - table data then you can see that we
03:56 - added in the correct record so there we
03:59 - go I know that this was a shorter video
04:01 - but we've added data to our table and
04:04 - now we have several records to work with
04:06 - and our next video will begin looking at
04:08 - how we can retrieve values from our
04:10 - table using the Select command and also
04:13 - we'll use the where command which allows
04:16 - us to specify exactly which records we
04:19 - want to retrieve so that about does it
04:21 - for this video if you have any questions
04:23 - just ask in the comment section below
04:25 - be sure to subscribe so that you're
04:27 - notified
04:27 - when these future SQL videos are
04:30 - released
04:30 - and thank you all for watching
