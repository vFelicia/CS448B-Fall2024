00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video I wanted to show you how you can
00:04 - open up files and directories using
00:07 - Sublime Text from within your terminal
00:10 - uh so if you use your Terminal A Lot
00:12 - you've probably run into a situation
00:14 - where uh you're within a project and uh
00:18 - you find the file that you want to open
00:21 - or if you want to open up the entire
00:22 - project uh what you do is you go into
00:24 - finder you find that project or you find
00:26 - that file and you open it up that way
00:29 - but uh that's kind of timec consuming
00:31 - it'd be really nice if we had a command
00:33 - uh maybe called
00:34 - subl um and then the name of the file
00:37 - that we wanted and we could just open up
00:39 - the file that way uh well Sublime Text
00:42 - actually has in a built-in command line
00:45 - tool that we can use that does this um
00:48 - but it doesn't add it to our path
00:50 - automatically to where we can use that
00:51 - command so the location of this command
00:54 - is in applications Sublime Text contents
00:59 - share support and it's within this bin
01:02 - folder and it's called
01:04 - subl so if I type out this whole command
01:08 - and then type in X
01:10 - index.html whenever I hit enter you can
01:12 - see that it opens up that file from
01:14 - within Sublime Text so that's exactly
01:16 - what we want but this file or this line
01:20 - here is extremely long it would be nice
01:22 - if we could just type in this subl
01:24 - command and do it that way now there are
01:28 - two ways that we can go about this um
01:30 - first let me Echo out my path here and
01:34 - so what this shows is the these are the
01:38 - locations where your computer looks for
01:41 - these commands um so I've got a couple
01:44 - extra ones here but uh you can kind of
01:46 - see a theme here there's user local bin
01:48 - user bin bin uh user s bin um so what we
01:54 - our two options are we could add this
01:57 - whole line here up to this bin folder we
02:00 - could add that to our path or we could
02:03 - add this command into one of these
02:05 - existing folders and just link it to
02:09 - this command here and that's the
02:11 - approach that I'm going to take I just
02:13 - think that it's easier it's one line you
02:15 - don't have to go in and edit your uh
02:17 - bash RC files and things like that um so
02:19 - the one line to do that we can do an LNS
02:23 - which will create a link and then we can
02:27 - just copy this from before the entire
02:29 - thing
02:30 - and paste that in so that is what we are
02:33 - linking to and then to create our link
02:36 - we'll just type in user and I'm going to
02:38 - go ahead and go with this uh user local
02:41 - bin and so user local bin and the name
02:44 - of the command and I'm just going to
02:46 - stick with subl so let's go ahead and
02:48 - hit enter and now if I do an
02:52 - lsla within this user local bin
02:57 - directory and I'm going to take away
02:59 - that command and then I'm also going to
03:02 - do a GP for the name of the command so
03:05 - let's hit enter and you can see here
03:07 - that it found uh one entry and this L
03:11 - right at the front means that it's a
03:12 - link and you can see that it has the
03:15 - name of the command here and that it
03:17 - links to Applications uh Sublime Text
03:19 - app contents shared support bin and the
03:22 - command that we want so now that that's
03:25 - set up for us we should just be able to
03:27 - type in the short command and then the
03:30 - name of the file that we want hit enter
03:32 - and it opens it up in Sublime Text and
03:35 - this isn't only for opening up files we
03:37 - can open up um we can use this just like
03:40 - we use any other terminal tool now so it
03:43 - accepts relative pass so we can type in
03:45 - subl and do a DOT for the current
03:47 - directory and then if I open up my
03:50 - sidebar
03:51 - here then you can see that it opened up
03:54 - uh the entire test project um I can do
03:57 - that command with a dot dot
04:00 - Dash to open up the directory above and
04:03 - you can see that now I have three
04:05 - projects in this Parent Directory so you
04:08 - can use this just about any way that you
04:11 - want to use it and uh it's a lot faster
04:14 - than um tracking down these files from
04:17 - within your finder if you're already
04:19 - looking at them from within your
04:20 - terminal anyway so that about does it
04:23 - for this video uh now you should be able
04:25 - to open up any files or directories from
04:28 - directly within your ter teral um so if
04:30 - you guys have any questions about this
04:32 - you know feel free to ask in the comment
04:34 - section below I hope that this video was
04:36 - useful for you guys and thank you for
04:38 - watching
