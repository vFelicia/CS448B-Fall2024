00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we'll be going over my
00:02 - favorite features and shortcuts and
00:04 - sublime text so sublime text as the
00:06 - editor that I use in most of my videos
00:08 - and I get tons of questions about how
00:10 - I'm doing certain things or what
00:11 - features I'm using so we'll cover my
00:13 - favorites here so learning how to use
00:15 - the features and shortcuts of the editor
00:17 - that you're using can definitely help
00:19 - you be more productive and get things
00:21 - done more quickly now this video will be
00:23 - for sublime text on the Mac OS X
00:25 - operating system so if you're on Windows
00:27 - then I have a video for that as well so
00:29 - I'll put a link to that in the
00:30 - description section below now what's
00:32 - going to do this as one single video but
00:35 - the shortcuts are so different between
00:36 - the operating systems that it was best
00:38 - just to split these into separate videos
00:40 - okay so the features that we're going to
00:42 - go over in this video will be features
00:44 - that will be available on the default
00:46 - installation of sublime text so you
00:48 - won't need any of the additional
00:49 - packages or anything else that I've
00:51 - installed with mine
00:52 - but if you're curious what packages and
00:54 - setup I'm using then I do have a
00:56 - separate video on that as well
00:57 - so I also put a link to that in the
00:59 - description section below also so with
01:02 - that said let's go ahead and get started
01:03 - so first of all the feature that I use
01:05 - most often and the one that I get asked
01:07 - about the most is the multi cursor
01:09 - functionality so I use this a lot in my
01:11 - videos to speed up certain things but I
01:13 - also use it all the time in my daily
01:15 - coding as well so this is also what will
01:18 - spend the most time one because there
01:20 - are a lot of different things that we
01:21 - can do with this now so for people who
01:23 - don't know what this is it's basically a
01:25 - way to have multiple cursors at once
01:28 - now at first that might not sound useful
01:30 - but let's see some examples and see why
01:32 - this is so awesome so I have a blank
01:34 - HTML file open here and let's say that
01:36 - we wanted to write some sample HTML code
01:38 - to put into a project so for example
01:41 - we'll create an unordered list with 10
01:43 - different items so I'll create an
01:45 - unordered list by hitting ul and tab to
01:48 - complete that and now we want ten list
01:50 - items and let's say that within those
01:52 - list items we want each one to be an h1
01:54 - tag so we could create one list item and
01:57 - then copy and paste that ten times or we
02:00 - can use multiple cursors to just type
02:01 - them all out at once so to do this I'm
02:04 - going to hit enter and make 10 blank
02:06 - lines so we already have one so two
02:08 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
02:10 - so now we have ten blank lines I'm just
02:13 - going to bring
02:13 - the cursor there to the beginning and
02:16 - now I'm going to create a new cursor on
02:18 - each line by clicking on the first line
02:21 - like I've done here and then holding
02:23 - down the command key and clicking on
02:26 - each spot where I want a new cursor so
02:28 - I'm going to hold down command and just
02:30 - click where I want these multiple
02:31 - cursors so you can see that it's
02:32 - creating a new cursor on each of these
02:34 - lines and once we have those cursors in
02:36 - place then we can just start typing and
02:39 - it will type that content in all of the
02:41 - cursor locations so if I want a list
02:43 - item then I can just type Li and hit tab
02:45 - and if I want an h1 tag now then I can
02:48 - hit type in h1 and hit tab and now let's
02:51 - put some text within that h1 tab so I'll
02:54 - save that so we can see how that typed
02:56 - out multiple lines for us all at once so
02:59 - using that command click is one way to
03:01 - get multiple cursors now another use
03:03 - case for this would be if we wanted to
03:05 - edit something in multiple places so for
03:08 - example let's say that we wanted to
03:09 - change all of the h1 tags in this list
03:11 - to be h2 tags now you might be thinking
03:14 - that you can just do a standard find and
03:16 - replace all and in this example you
03:18 - could but a shortcut for that is to just
03:21 - click up here in the first h1 and then
03:23 - press control/command G and we can see
03:27 - that that highlights all of our h1 tags
03:29 - for editing so then we could just edit
03:33 - all of those to be an h2 and save that
03:35 - so that changed all of the instances of
03:38 - the h1 tags but in a larger document you
03:41 - might have some h1 tags outside of this
03:43 - list that you don't want to change
03:44 - so simply highlighting and changing all
03:47 - of them might not be what we want so I'm
03:49 - gonna undo this and go back to h1 tags
03:52 - and save that and to get back to one
03:54 - cursor you can just do a regular click
03:57 - anywhere in the document so now let's
03:59 - say that we only want to change certain
04:00 - h1 tags so let's say that we want to
04:03 - change the last 5 h1 tags here to be h2s
04:06 - now one way you could do this is by
04:09 - clicking here where we want to start and
04:11 - then holding down command and just
04:13 - double clicking all of these instances
04:16 - that we want to change and that's
04:18 - creating multiple cursors at those
04:19 - locations but that takes a while
04:21 - there's actually a shortcut that we can
04:23 - use that will highlight the next match
04:25 - for us and create a new
04:26 - cursor so if I just select the first h1
04:30 - that we want to change here and then
04:32 - press command D and then keep pressing
04:35 - command D until we highlight all of the
04:39 - h1 tags that we want to change so I hit
04:42 - command D until I hit the bottom of the
04:44 - document now if I kept hitting command D
04:46 - then it would loop around here to the
04:47 - top but that's not what we want right
04:49 - now so now we can change all of these
04:52 - bottom h1 tags by just highlighting all
04:56 - those using that command D and then
04:58 - changing those to h2s
05:00 - so we can see that we were able to use
05:01 - those multiple cursors to only change
05:03 - those where we want it okay now another
05:05 - awesome thing that we can do with
05:06 - multiple cursors is to copy and paste
05:08 - multiple things at once so what do I
05:11 - mean by that well for example I have a
05:13 - snippets file open here as well with
05:16 - some text on some different lines so we
05:18 - can see that we have 10 items here on 10
05:20 - different lines so let's say that we
05:22 - want these items to be the text that is
05:25 - inside of our HTML list items so how
05:28 - could we do this well some people might
05:30 - just you know copy and paste these one
05:32 - at a time but that would take a really
05:34 - long time especially if our list was
05:36 - even larger than this so instead let's
05:39 - just highlight all of these at once and
05:41 - then copy and paste those so I'm going
05:43 - to hold in command and click at the end
05:47 - of each line like we saw before to
05:49 - create a cursor at the end of each of
05:52 - these lines and now I'm going to
05:54 - highlight the text by holding in command
05:56 - shift and then using the left arrow and
05:59 - it should go all the way to the
06:01 - beginning of that text and now I'm going
06:04 - to copy that by pressing command C so
06:07 - now our 10 cursors here all copied those
06:09 - 10 different lines so now let's go back
06:12 - to our HTML list and now let's highlight
06:15 - the 10 locations that we want to change
06:17 - so to do that we can click in our text
06:20 - up here at the top that says test and
06:22 - then we can hold in command and press D
06:24 - all the way until we get all the way
06:26 - down here to the bottom and remember
06:28 - that command D creates a new cursor each
06:31 - time so now we have 10 cursors here all
06:33 - at the end of our sample text there so
06:36 - now that we have all 10 of those
06:38 - highlighted then we can simply paste in
06:40 - what we
06:40 - copied by pressing command V and we can
06:43 - see that it pastes in our 10 copied
06:45 - items into our ten different locations
06:47 - now when you copy and paste multiple
06:49 - items like this you have to have the
06:51 - same number of cursors that you use to
06:53 - copy in order to paste if you don't then
06:56 - it will paste all of the items and that
06:58 - can be pretty ugly so for example let me
07:00 - just show you what that would look like
07:01 - so I'm going to go down here to the
07:03 - bottom of the document and create a few
07:05 - blank lines here and I'm just going to
07:07 - create two cursors so I'm going to hold
07:11 - in command and create another cursor
07:12 - there so remember we have 10 items
07:15 - copied but now we only have two cursors
07:18 - so if I paste in with just two cursors
07:21 - then we can see that it pastes in all
07:23 - ten of our items in both of those spots
07:25 - so be on the lookout for that it might
07:28 - be what you wanted to do but it might
07:29 - not be so if you have 10 cursors like we
07:32 - did with our list then it will just
07:34 - paste one item per cursor like it did
07:37 - here in our HTML list so this multi
07:40 - cursor a copy and paste trick has saved
07:42 - me a ton of time more times than I can
07:44 - count
07:44 - it's really awesome once you get the
07:46 - hang of it now another thing that I use
07:48 - this multi cursor functionality for is
07:50 - to split things out and make them more
07:52 - readable so for example if I go over
07:55 - here to my snippets file and look down
07:58 - here at the bottom so this snippet down
07:59 - here at the bottom is a real example of
08:02 - my path environment variable now if you
08:03 - don't know what that is then don't worry
08:05 - about it it's just basically a list of
08:06 - directories on your machine where your
08:08 - terminal looks for commands now all of
08:11 - these directories are currently
08:12 - separated by colons so that's not really
08:14 - readable right now especially if this
08:17 - was to contain a lot more directories
08:19 - than it currently does so let's say that
08:20 - I wanted to split these up on two
08:22 - different lines so that I could read
08:24 - this a little better so to do this I can
08:26 - simply highlight the first colon here
08:28 - and now I'm just going to hold in
08:30 - command and press D until I highlight
08:33 - the last colon so now we have multiple
08:36 - cursors here so to replace those colons
08:38 - with a new line I can just simply hit
08:40 - enter and we can see that now they're
08:42 - split up on two different lines and
08:44 - those being split up like that makes it
08:46 - a lot more readable okay so now that we
08:49 - saw a few examples of using this an HTML
08:51 - let's look at a quick example of how you
08:53 - might use this
08:54 - and Python so we'll just do a quick
08:56 - overview of the few things that we just
08:58 - now learned so I have a sample Python
09:00 - script opened up here so let me switch
09:02 - over to that so this is from my object
09:05 - Ornan video where we started learning
09:06 - about classes and manually setting
09:08 - attributes now this is an actual mistake
09:10 - that I made in that video so if you look
09:13 - here I created an employee one and an
09:16 - employee two and then I'm setting some
09:18 - attributes for both of those so I set
09:20 - some employee 1 attributes here and this
09:23 - is supposed to be where I'm setting
09:24 - employee two attributes but you can see
09:26 - that I accidentally set these on
09:28 - employee 1 again so all of these should
09:30 - actually be employee two so we could go
09:33 - through and manually fix these or we can
09:35 - simply use multi cursors to just click
09:38 - on this employee one here and then press
09:41 - command D until we highlight all of the
09:44 - ones that we want to change now remember
09:46 - this isn't a global change we don't want
09:47 - to change all the employee ones just the
09:49 - Ford that we made a mistake with here so
09:51 - now that we have those multiple cursors
09:53 - then I can just come in here and do a
09:56 - backspace on the one and make that a two
09:58 - and now let's say that our boss tells us
10:00 - that this EMP variable name isn't
10:03 - descriptive enough and that we need to
10:05 - change it to something more descriptive
10:07 - so we want these EMP 1 and EMP 2 to
10:11 - actually be employee 1 an employee 2
10:13 - spelled out so in this case since we
10:16 - want to change all of these then we can
10:18 - just highlight this EMP underscore here
10:21 - and then to just highlight all of these
10:23 - in the document then we can press ctrl
10:25 - command G and then change these to
10:29 - whatever we want so now that we have all
10:31 - of those highlighted then we can come in
10:32 - here and just type out employee ok so
10:36 - that's a look at the multi cursor
10:37 - functionality now that's by far my
10:39 - favorite feature and sublime text and
10:41 - this is also becoming more popular and
10:43 - other editors as well so even if you're
10:45 - not using sublime text then check if the
10:48 - editor that you are using has multi
10:50 - cursor functionality and start using it
10:52 - if it does because it'll save you a ton
10:54 - of time doing stuff like this ok so now
10:56 - let's look at some more features and
10:58 - shortcuts that I use a lot in sublime so
11:00 - one feature that I use all the time is
11:02 - switching between tabs and creating
11:04 - multiple panes so first of all we can
11:07 - see that we already have
11:08 - pull tabs open here with multiple files
11:10 - open so to switch through these tabs
11:12 - with a keyboard shortcut we can simply
11:15 - hold down command and option and then
11:18 - use the left and right arrows to switch
11:20 - through these tabs so that's how I'm
11:22 - switching through these tabs right now
11:24 - now if we want to close a tab then we
11:26 - can press command + W and that will
11:29 - close down the tab now to reopen a
11:31 - closed tab if you open if you close that
11:33 - on accident then you can hit command
11:36 - shift + T and it'll reopen that closed
11:39 - tab so command W to close the tab and
11:42 - command shift T to reopen a close tab
11:44 - now if you're a chrome user then that
11:47 - should be familiar to you because it's
11:49 - the same keyboard shortcuts for Google
11:51 - Chrome and I'm glad that sublime text
11:53 - used those familiar shortcuts ok so now
11:56 - that we've looked at tabs now let's look
11:58 - at how to set multiple panels now this
12:01 - is something that I use a lot especially
12:03 - when I'm doing something like web
12:04 - development where I want to be able to
12:06 - see the HTML and the CSS at the same
12:08 - time or maybe look at a Django or flask
12:11 - view and a template at the same time or
12:13 - anything like that so there are a lot of
12:16 - different panel layouts that we can use
12:17 - if we press command option + 2 then we
12:22 - can see that it will open two panels
12:24 - side by side in a column layout and we
12:27 - can drag any tabs over here that we
12:30 - would like so that we can see these at
12:33 - the same time so now I have my snippets
12:35 - viewable over here as well as the Python
12:38 - code here now if we hold in command
12:40 - option + 3 then it'll open up three
12:44 - columns side by side and we can drag the
12:47 - files here so that we can view three
12:50 - files at once so this is extremely
12:52 - useful if you're working on front-end
12:54 - code and you want to see your HTML
12:56 - Javascript and CSS all at once now if we
13:00 - press command option 4 then it'll open
13:04 - up four columns now I feel like this
13:06 - starts to get a little crowded and less
13:08 - practical but I guess if you had a very
13:10 - large monitor then maybe some would find
13:12 - it useful now if you press command
13:15 - option + 5 then it still opens only 4
13:18 - panels but it'll split your 4 panels
13:20 - into a grid
13:21 - and I think this would be more practical
13:23 - on a larger monitor but I still don't
13:25 - use this often I mainly stick to the two
13:28 - panels or the three panels now if you
13:30 - prefer to stack them on top of each
13:32 - other rather than the side-by-side then
13:35 - you can hold in command option shift two
13:38 - and that will open up two rows instead
13:41 - of two columns so we can see here I have
13:42 - the Python on top and the HTML here on
13:45 - the bottom and the snippets tech tab is
13:48 - still down here at the bottom as well
13:50 - and if you ever just want to get back to
13:51 - a single window then you can do that by
13:53 - pressing command option + 1 and that'll
13:57 - take you back to the single window okay
13:59 - so another nice quick shortcut that I
14:01 - like is being able to move lines around
14:03 - using control command and then the up
14:06 - and down arrows so for example let me
14:08 - bring up the HTML here and let's say
14:11 - that we wanted to move a few of these
14:12 - items around so instead of copying and
14:14 - paste them in different places we can
14:16 - simply click on the line that we want to
14:18 - move so I'm going to move this bottom
14:20 - row here and I'm going to move it up to
14:22 - the top so we can do this
14:24 - just by clicking on this line and then
14:27 - holding down control command and then
14:29 - using the up and down arrows to move
14:31 - this wherever we want it to go so if I
14:33 - move this all the way up to the top then
14:36 - we can see that that was a lot easier
14:38 - than just copying and pasting it up
14:39 - there so let's say that we wanted to
14:41 - reverse this entire list so we could
14:43 - just put our cursor on these lines and
14:46 - then again that's control command and
14:49 - the up and down arrows so I can move the
14:51 - the top item to the bottom and then
14:54 - these bottom items to the top and if we
14:56 - do this enough times then we can quickly
15:00 - switch that list around so that's a lot
15:03 - faster than just simply cutting and
15:05 - pasting all of those items just one at a
15:07 - time ok so the rest of these features
15:10 - are going to be really quick keyboard
15:12 - shortcuts so first of all in my videos
15:15 - I'll often run Python code using sublime
15:17 - text so sublime has a built in build
15:20 - system where it'll try to run the code
15:22 - of whatever language you are using so
15:24 - let me open up our Python code here and
15:28 - we can see that at the bottom we have
15:29 - this print statement where it prints out
15:31 - this employee ones email and the
15:33 - keyboard shortcut for running code
15:35 - is command and be and we can see that
15:38 - when we hit command B it prints out the
15:40 - email down here at the bottom now by
15:43 - default sublime will try to guess how
15:44 - you want to try to run certain code but
15:47 - if you're using different versions of
15:48 - Python or anything like that then I have
15:50 - a separate video on sublime build
15:52 - systems showing how you can set those up
15:54 - exactly how you want and if you ever
15:56 - want to get rid of this output down here
15:58 - then you can just press escape and it
16:00 - hides that window okay so another thing
16:02 - that I like to use a lot is whenever
16:05 - I've opened a directory is to get more
16:07 - screen space and collapse the sidebar
16:09 - here so to collapse the sidebar we can
16:13 - hold down command and then press K and
16:16 - then B and we can see that that
16:18 - collapsed that sidebar down now you want
16:20 - to be holding in command the whole time
16:21 - so if we want to open that back up again
16:23 - then we can hold down command and while
16:25 - holding that down we press K and then B
16:27 - and it opens that back up okay so
16:29 - something else I use a lot is the
16:31 - keyboard shortcut for commenting out
16:33 - code and to do that we can use the
16:35 - command ford slash shortcut and this
16:38 - works for multiple languages as well so
16:41 - over here in my HTML if I want to
16:44 - comment out these last five list items
16:46 - then I can just highlight those and
16:47 - press ctrl or command ford slash sorry
16:50 - then we can see a comments out those
16:52 - last five items if I come over here to
16:55 - the Python code then we can do this as
16:57 - well so if I just click on this line
17:00 - here and I wanted to comment that out
17:02 - then that is command Ford slash and that
17:05 - comments out that one line or we can
17:07 - highlight multiple lines and press
17:09 - command Ford slash and it comments out
17:11 - all of those lines that we had
17:12 - highlighted so we can see that the HTML
17:14 - and the Python both have different
17:17 - syntax and different ways of commenting
17:20 - their code and sublime adds those in
17:22 - correctly automatically for each
17:23 - language so that's extremely useful okay
17:26 - so lastly another one of my favorite
17:27 - features with sublime is the command
17:29 - palette now you can open the command

17:34 - with the command palette open you can do
17:37 - a few different things like setting
17:39 - different syntaxes and things like that
17:40 - but the best thing that you can do is
17:42 - install new packages and packages allow
17:46 - you to add functionality that currently
17:48 - is
17:48 - in sublime so for example you may have
17:50 - noticed that my HTML has been Auto
17:53 - formatting throughout the video and

17:58 - your code for you and you can also
18:00 - install different packages that change
18:02 - the color schemes and the themes of
