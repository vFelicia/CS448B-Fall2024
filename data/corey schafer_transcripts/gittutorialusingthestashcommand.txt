00:00 - hey what's up everybody in this video I
00:02 - thought we could take a look at the git
00:04 - stash command uh the git stash command
00:07 - is great whenever you have uh some
00:09 - changes that you're not quite ready to
00:10 - commit and maybe you need to uh switch
00:13 - branches or uh even uh just you want to
00:17 - revert back temporarily to where it was
00:19 - that you started um and you don't know
00:22 - what to do with your changes uh well you
00:23 - can do a stash on those changes and it
00:26 - will save them in a temporary place to
00:29 - where you can go and do what it is that
00:31 - you need to do and then come back to
00:32 - those changes later on uh so the best
00:35 - way is just to show you an example here
00:37 - um so I've got a very simple Pi file
00:41 - over here it's just an add subtract
00:43 - multiply and divide uh functions and
00:47 - right now uh they don't have any return
00:49 - values so let's say that we wanted to
00:51 - start working on this uh python file so
00:54 - we could just do a um get Branch ad
00:59 - because we want to work on the ad
01:00 - function first and then we can check
01:03 - that out get checkout ad and now let's
01:05 - go in here and start working on our ad
01:07 - function so we can do return a plus b
01:11 - and save that now if I go over here and
01:14 - do a get diff you can see that we have
01:17 - uh changed these lines here now let's
01:20 - say for whatever reason we need to uh
01:23 - switch back to our Master branch and
01:24 - check something out or we need to
01:27 - see uh what our um Pi file looked like
01:33 - before we started messing with it um so
01:35 - what we can do here is we can just stash
01:37 - our changes and to go back to where we
01:39 - were so to do that we can do a get stash
01:43 - save and now we need to type in a
01:45 - message for ourselves to remind us of
01:47 - what this um stash was doing so I can
01:51 - just say worked on ADD function so hit
01:55 - enter there and you can see that it is
01:58 - uh now saved and now if I clear this out
02:01 - and do a get diff nothing shows up and
02:05 - if I do a get status you can see that
02:07 - there's nothing to commit and if I go
02:09 - back over here to my file you can see
02:12 - that all the changes that we made are
02:14 - now gone they've been wiped out but
02:16 - they're not gone for good if I do now we
02:19 - just stashed it so if I do a get stash
02:21 - list then you can see here it's a stash
02:25 - and all the stashes have these um IDs
02:28 - here this one is zero and you can see
02:30 - the message that we put in uh that we
02:32 - gave ourselves to remind us of what what
02:35 - these changes were so I said that we
02:37 - worked on our ad function so now you can
02:40 - go and do whatever it is that you needed
02:41 - to do you can switch branches uh you
02:44 - know work on other things but whenever
02:46 - you're ready to come back uh to these
02:48 - changes that you made um so we want to
02:51 - bring these changes back there's two
02:52 - ways we can do this we can do get stash
02:56 - apply and then let's copy that and just
03:00 - paste that in there if we do a get stash
03:02 - apply I'm going to go ahead and hit
03:04 - enter now you can see that it has made
03:06 - these changes again if I go back to my
03:08 - file you can see that our changes are
03:10 - now back but now if I do a get stash
03:14 - list again uh you can see that our stash
03:17 - is still there it didn't get rid of it
03:20 - that's because when we do get stash
03:21 - apply uh we're uh taking all the changes
03:25 - that were in that stash but we're not
03:26 - getting rid of the stash so it's still
03:28 - there um so let me do a get checkout and
03:33 - I'm just going to that just resets us
03:35 - back to where we were so now if I go
03:38 - back to the file this is where we
03:40 - started from and so now instead of doing
03:44 - let me do a get stash list instead of
03:46 - doing a get stash apply to fetch those
03:48 - changes I'm going to do a get stash pop
03:52 - and what pop will do is it will grab the
03:55 - very first stash in the list of stashes
03:58 - and we only have one here so it's going
03:59 - to be the top one and then it's going
04:02 - to apply those changes and then it's
04:05 - going to drop the stash so now if I do a
04:07 - get stash list you can see that we don't
04:10 - have any stashes available but even
04:12 - though it deleted that stash uh if I
04:14 - click over here on the file it did give
04:17 - us our changes back so if I do a get
04:19 - diff uh you can see where we made our
04:22 - changes here now let's say that I just
04:25 - decided to go ahead and go and uh fill
04:28 - in the uh rest of these functions here
04:30 - so I can do a minus B
04:35 - turn a Time B and return a / B save that
04:42 - so if I do a get diff you can see we
04:44 - have all of our changes Here and Now
04:47 - what if somebody told us that they
04:48 - wanted that uh they wanted us to add in
04:51 - a square function um well let's go ahead
04:54 - and stash the changes that we've made so
04:56 - far so get stash change and we can just
04:59 - do
05:00 - um we'll call these Cal functions and
05:04 - now just to make sure that that worked
05:05 - if I do a get stash list you can see
05:08 - that we have our stashed value here and
05:11 - if I click back over here onto the file
05:13 - you can see that it set everything back
05:15 - uh to what we started with so now if I
05:20 - want to add in this squared function
05:22 - then I can just do a square there and
05:26 - save that and now if I do a get diff
05:29 - then you can see uh that we have those
05:33 - changes of adding in uh that squared
05:35 - function but now let's say that you know
05:38 - maybe we need to change branches again
05:40 - or something like that so we're going to
05:41 - go ahead and stash these changes so
05:44 - let's do get stash save and I'll say
05:48 - added Square function that's okay that I
05:51 - misspelled that so now I do a get stash
05:55 - list and you can see that it pushed our
05:58 - Cal functions down down to the stash one
06:02 - and now our most recent change is up
06:05 - here at stash zero so if if at this
06:09 - point I get did a get stash pop then
06:13 - it's going to uh pop off
06:16 - the uh squared function because it was
06:19 - in that top position um so now let me go
06:22 - ahead and if I did a get stash list you
06:26 - can see that it popped that one up PO
06:28 - that one off this one's back to the zero
06:30 - position now I'm going to stash this
06:32 - again with the same message that we had
06:35 - before and if I could do a get stash
06:38 - list you can see that now it put that
06:41 - square function right back on top to
06:42 - where it was now what if somebody uh
06:45 - came and told us that um you know all of
06:47 - a sudden we don't need the square
06:49 - function anymore um so all these changes
06:52 - we we can just go ahead and get rid of
06:53 - these um so to do that we can do a get
06:57 - stash drop and and it's just like get
07:00 - stash apply we got we're going to take
07:02 - the name of the one that we want to drop
07:04 - here so I'm going to get the one that is
07:06 - on the ad Square function I'm just going
07:08 - to paste that in so we do our get stash
07:11 - drop with the stash that we want which
07:14 - is our top one hit enter and then if I
07:17 - go back over here to my file uh you can
07:20 - see that it is where we started and if I
07:23 - go back over here to my terminal and do
07:25 - a get stash
07:28 - list then you you can see that the only
07:30 - stash that we have is our changes to the
07:33 - calc functions and so one more time just
07:36 - here for uh an example let me go ahead
07:39 - and make a couple more changes over here
07:41 - I'm going to make one more stash I'm
07:42 - just going to put the square function
07:44 - back in here again and let me just go
07:47 - ahead and do a get stash save add Square
07:50 - function again get stash list and you
07:53 - can see now we have our two stashes
07:56 - again and now we say that we wanted to
07:59 - get rid of all of our stashes and not
08:01 - just one stash um so this is going to
08:04 - get rid of all the changes that we have
08:05 - in there now be careful when you run
08:07 - this because um it's going to get rid of
08:11 - all the stashes that you have but say
08:13 - that all those changes that you made
08:15 - were just junk and you no longer want
08:16 - them anymore you can just run get stash
08:19 - clear and what that's going to do is
08:21 - it's going to you can see that our file
08:23 - here is exactly the way it was whenever
08:26 - uh we first started and if I do a get
08:29 - stash list we don't have any of those
08:32 - stashes with any of the changes that we
08:34 - made so that is a brief overview of uh
08:38 - the ways that you're most likely uh
08:41 - going to use get stash most of the time
08:44 - um one way that this really comes in
08:46 - handy is if I check out my master Branch
08:49 - here um say that I went in and made uh
08:53 - my changes to add right now so I did um
08:57 - return a plus b and save that and then I
09:01 - did a get status and I saw that I
09:04 - modified the file and a get diff and I
09:06 - can see the lines that I changed here
09:08 - but then I realize that I'm on my master
09:10 - branch and whenever I try to change to
09:13 - my uh ad Branch it's saying hey you have
09:16 - uncommitted files here uh we can't do
09:18 - that um and you don't want to commit
09:21 - those changes to your master branch and
09:23 - you meant to do that on your ad Branch
09:25 - well the best way to do that is just to
09:27 - do a get stash because stash is over
09:29 - from Branch to Branch so right here I
09:32 - can do a get stash save and just call
09:36 - this add function there and then so now
09:40 - if I do get status you can see that
09:42 - there's nothing to commit and I'll do
09:44 - get
09:45 - checkout add and then get stash pop
09:50 - which Pops at top change off and get
09:52 - diff and then from there um those
09:55 - changes that you meant to commit to add
09:58 - now you can do that just um add all your
10:01 - changes and you know put in a commit
10:05 - message
10:08 - there so that's a brief overview of get
10:11 - stash and a couple of examples of how
10:13 - you would use that um you know hopefully
10:15 - this uh uh quick video was useful for
10:18 - you guys if you have any questions about
10:20 - it you know just ask in the comment
10:21 - section below um be sure to subscribe
