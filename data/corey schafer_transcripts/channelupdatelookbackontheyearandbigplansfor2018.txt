00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video I just want to give a quick
00:02 - update on the channel I quick look back
00:04 - on 2017 and also what to look forward to
00:07 - in 2018 so first of all I've been out of
00:10 - town a lot lately so I've been a bit
00:11 - behind on putting out videos but I just
00:13 - wanted to let you know that I will be
00:14 - releasing a video this week and have a
00:16 - few others that I'm currently working on
00:17 - so I've just been busy traveling home
00:19 - for the holidays and also I went out of
00:21 - town for the Amazon Web Services
00:23 - conference a couple of weeks ago and the
00:25 - conference was a great experience and
00:27 - there are a lot of videos that I'd like
00:28 - to make in the future on Amazon Web
00:30 - Services and how to get started using
00:32 - those but I was also so busy that I
00:34 - wasn't able to put as much time as usual
00:36 - into getting videos released but I will
00:38 - be putting out a video this week on
00:40 - Python contacts managers so be on the
00:42 - lookout for that okay so I also wanted
00:44 - to give a quick update on the channel
00:46 - and what to expect moving forward so
00:49 - 2017 was a big year for this channel the
00:52 - most popular videos released this year
00:54 - was probably the nine part introduction
00:56 - of Python series where we covered you
00:59 - know Python data structures and
01:00 - functions and working with the standard
01:02 - library but there was also a lot of
01:04 - other popular videos released you know
01:06 - covering regular expressions and unit
01:08 - testing essential skills for programmers
01:10 - web scraping and several other topics
01:12 - and I just really want to thank everyone
01:14 - who has subscribed to the channel and
01:16 - also those who support the channel so at
01:19 - the beginning of 2017 I think I had less
01:21 - than 20 thousand subscribers and it
01:23 - looks like we're going to go into 2018
01:25 - with probably around eighty thousand but
01:27 - just recently we hit 75,000 subscribers
01:30 - just the other day so I really want to
01:32 - thank you all for that and also on
01:35 - patreon I think I started the year
01:37 - having around 20 patreon supporters at
01:39 - the beginning of 2017 and will probably
01:42 - end that with around 75 supporters going
01:46 - into 2018 so right now we have 74 and I
01:50 - just really want to thank all of you all
01:52 - currently there are 55 who wanted to be
01:54 - you know who were ok with the public
01:57 - contributors page on my website but I
02:00 - just really appreciate all the support
02:02 - that you guys give the channel and you
02:04 - really make it possible because I really
02:06 - wouldn't be able to put as much time
02:07 - into these tutorials without you all and
02:09 - it really helps with creating these
02:10 - videos moving forward
02:12 - so speaking of moving forward I also
02:14 - wanted to mention a little of what to
02:16 - expect in 2018 so I really want to put
02:21 - out a lot more content in 2018 than any
02:24 - year before so there have been a lot of
02:26 - larger tutorials that many of you have
02:27 - been wanting for a long time and I
02:29 - really want to be sure to cover as many
02:30 - of those topics as possible so I'm
02:32 - finally going to get around to getting
02:34 - out of series on creating a
02:35 - full-featured web application I spelled
02:37 - that wrong don't worry about that so
02:39 - I'll do one of those in flask and Django
02:41 - and possibly some other frameworks as
02:43 - well and I'd also like to do a series on
02:46 - data science where I cover you know
02:48 - things like numpy and pandas and Syfy
02:50 - and also I'd like to cover some DevOps
02:53 - and assist admin videos covering you
02:55 - know getting started with Amazon Web
02:57 - Services and how to use docker and
02:59 - ansible and all kinds of different
03:02 - technologies and there are some other
03:03 - big announcements that I have in mind
03:04 - for early 2018 but I'm not quite to the
03:07 - point where I'm ready to talk about
03:08 - those just yet but early next year I'll
03:10 - make a couple of videos covering some
03:12 - more future plans that I have in mind so
03:14 - that is going to do it for this video
03:15 - again I apologize that the holidays and
03:18 - some traveling have slowed down my
03:19 - releases a little bit but watch out for
03:21 - a new video coming out this week on
03:23 - contacts managers and I should be back
03:25 - on schedule with regular releases soon
03:27 - and as usual if you have any questions
03:29 - and feel free to ask in the comment
03:30 - section below and I'll do my best to
03:32 - answer those and also like I mentioned
03:33 - before if you enjoy these tutorials and
03:36 - would like to support them then there

03:38 - easiest ways to simply like the video

03:42 - huge help to share all these videos with
