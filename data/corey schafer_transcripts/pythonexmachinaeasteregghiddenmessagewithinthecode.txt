00:00 - hey everybody how's it going this is
00:02 - just gonna be a short little video just
00:04 - for fun we're not gonna go over tutorial
00:06 - or anything like that I just wanted to
00:08 - show you guys something that one of my
00:10 - friends pointed out to me that I thought
00:11 - was pretty neat so there's this movie I
00:13 - liked a lot called ex machina and it's
00:16 - about this genius programmer who owns
00:19 - this multi-billion dollar company and he
00:22 - goes out into the middle of nowhere to
00:23 - work on this artificial intelligence
00:25 - system and after he builds this AI
00:28 - system he has one of his best employees
00:31 - come out to the resort to give it the
00:33 - Turing test and to test whether it's
00:35 - actually displays real intelligence or
00:38 - not and I thought the movie was great
00:40 - it's super intense but there's one point
00:44 - in the movie where on one of his
00:45 - monitors this Python code pops up and
00:48 - it's only for a split second but if you
00:50 - pause it then and write down that Python
00:53 - code then this is all the Python code
00:55 - right here
00:56 - at the top it has this comment blue book
00:59 - code decryption and then the rest of it
01:02 - just kind of looks like gibberish it
01:04 - doesn't seem like it would actually do
01:05 - anything but if we run this code then
01:09 - the output is this ISBN number and an
01:13 - ISBN number is a code for books so if we
01:17 - copy this and then go over to Amazon and
01:21 - search for this ISBN number then it's
01:25 - this top result here the embodiment and
01:29 - the inner life cognition and
01:31 - consciousness in the space of possible
01:33 - minds so I thought that was a pretty
01:34 - cool Easter Egg that they threw there
01:36 - into that movie like I said I thought
01:38 - the movie was really good if you guys
01:40 - give it a watch then be on the lookout
01:43 - for that Python code it just pops up
01:45 - really fast but but yeah check it out
01:47 - and you can type in the Python code for
01:50 - yourself and and run it and see what you
01:52 - get but yeah that's it for this video
01:54 - thank you guys for watching
01:58 - you
