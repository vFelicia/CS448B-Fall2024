00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video I'm gonna write a quick and
00:03 - easy script that monitors my personal
00:05 - website and sends me an email if it's
00:07 - down for any reason
00:08 - now if the site is down then I'm also
00:09 - going to have it have the script
00:11 - automatically restart my server to see
00:13 - if that fixes the problem now a lot of
00:15 - people have wanted me to make videos on
00:16 - real-world problems that I can solve
00:18 - with programming and this is a strip
00:20 - that I've been needing to write for a
00:21 - while now so my personal website runs on
00:24 - a server that is pretty old at this
00:25 - point
00:26 - and it really just needs to be
00:27 - completely wiped and updated so that
00:29 - it's more stable but it's one of those
00:31 - things that I just haven't had the time
00:32 - to do but with the server in its current
00:35 - state
00:35 - sometimes web processes occasionally
00:37 - quit unexpectedly and cause my website
00:39 - not to load now for those of you who
00:41 - have followed along with either my flask
00:43 - or Django series then don't worry the
00:45 - servers that we set up in that series
00:46 - are completely fine and stable this is
00:49 - just a server that I set up years and
00:51 - years ago that I used to test a lot of
00:53 - different software and development and
00:55 - then I just plot my personal website on
00:57 - there so after all those years of having
00:59 - different configurations and
01:00 - installations it's just not very stable
01:03 - anymore so until I can get around to
01:05 - updating that I'm just gonna write a
01:06 - quick script that occasionally checks my
01:08 - website and if it's not returning a 200
01:11 - response which means that it was a
01:12 - successful response then I'll just have
01:14 - it send me an email so that I know I
01:16 - need to go fix it now this website is
01:18 - hosted on low note so I also use the
01:21 - node API to automatically restart the
01:23 - server so that it possibly fixes itself
01:26 - before I even get the email so this is
01:28 - going to be a pretty quick and easy
01:30 - script but I thought some of you might
01:32 - find it useful to see me write this up
01:34 - now I'm not gonna go into as much
01:35 - step-by-step detail as to exactly what
01:38 - I'm doing like I do in my other
01:39 - tutorials I'm just going to step through
01:41 - this quickly and give you an idea of how
01:43 - a quick script can help you solve a
01:45 - real-world problem like this so let's go
01:48 - ahead and get started so first of all
01:50 - I'm going to create a directory of
01:51 - everything for this little project so
01:54 - I'm in my home folder within my terminal
01:56 - and I'm going to create a directory
01:58 - called site monitor so I'm gonna say
02:00 - m'kay der site underscore monitor now
02:05 - I'm on a Mac which mostly uses the Linux
02:07 - Linux commands if you're on Windows then
02:09 - you'll have to either do this through
02:11 - your file explorer or use the windows
02:13 - for your command prompt okay so I'm
02:16 - going to CD into that directory that I
02:18 - just created and I'm going to create a
02:21 - virtual environment for this little
02:22 - project now I've been using the V env
02:25 - module in the Python standard library
02:26 - lately instead of virtual Envy and it's
02:29 - pretty simple to use and you don't have
02:31 - to install anything so I can just say
02:33 - Python 3 - M de and V and then I'll call
02:39 - this virtual environment Monitor
02:41 - underscore env so I will run that so now
02:46 - I have a new virtual environment called
02:48 - monitor underscore env so now I can
02:51 - activate that so I'll say source monitor
02:54 - E and V /bin board slash activate so
02:59 - that is now activated we can see from
03:02 - the prompt here that it's active and
03:03 - again this source command is for Mac and
03:06 - Linux
03:06 - if you're on Windows then you would do
03:08 - something like this you'd say monitor
03:11 - env back slash scripts back slash
03:15 - activate dot bat or something like that
03:17 - I think that's right but this is on Mac
03:21 - and Linux okay so now I have a fresh
03:23 - environment and I'm going to be using a
03:25 - couple of packages for this script so
03:27 - I'm going to use the request library to
03:29 - check the response from my website and I
03:31 - do have a more in-depth video on the
03:33 - request library if you'd like to see how
03:35 - to use this in more detail so I'll leave
03:37 - a link to that video in the description
03:38 - section below and I'm also going to be
03:40 - using the lonoa thon library to interact
03:43 - with my server so I have this open here
03:46 - in the browser and let me go to that
03:49 - documentation here so this is the low
03:51 - note Python library that allows you to
03:53 - interact with your low notes through
03:55 - Python and we'll see more about this
03:57 - later in the tutorial so now we want to
04:01 - install both of those packages and we
04:03 - can do that through pip so once we've
04:05 - got the environment activated let's pip
04:07 - install these packages so first I'll
04:09 - install the request library so I'll say
04:11 - pip install requests and this one is
04:14 - usually pretty quick okay that's done
04:16 - and also I want to install the Lund ode
04:19 - Python library that I can use to talk to
04:22 - my low note servers through Python so to
04:24 - do that I can say pip install and
04:27 - that is the node underscore API for now
04:31 - if you want to know how I got that it's
04:32 - here in their documentation pip install
04:34 - the node API for so let me run that now
04:39 - with this lonoa thawne library we're
04:42 - gonna need a personal access token in
04:44 - order to interact with our lenôtre count
04:46 - and that's good because it's a layer of
04:48 - security that makes us prove who we are
04:50 - before doing anything with our servers
04:52 - so but let's go ahead and continue on
04:54 - with the email script for now and I'll
04:56 - grab that personal access token once
04:59 - we're ready to interact with the low
05:00 - note server okay so now that we have
05:02 - those packages installed let's actually
05:04 - write the scrip to monitor the website
05:06 - so I'm still here within my directory
05:08 - for this project so I'm going to open
05:10 - this up in sublime so I'm just going to
05:13 - do that with su BL and then dot for the
05:17 - current directory now I have my
05:19 - command-line shortcut set up to open
05:22 - sublime with that su BL command if you
05:25 - don't have that then you can just open
05:26 - this directory and your text editor like
05:29 - you normally would
05:30 - okay so now I'm going to create a new
05:32 - script in this directory so new file and
05:34 - I'm going to call this monitor dot py so
05:37 - now we have an empty Python script here
05:39 - okay so first I'm going to import the
05:43 - request library okay so now we're going
05:47 - to use request to make a request to my
05:49 - home page so we can do that by saying R
05:52 - is equal to request dot get and this
05:57 - needs to be in a string here so this is
05:59 - HTTP forge slashes query MS dot-com and
06:05 - I'm going to set a timeout there equal
06:07 - to let's say five seconds now you want
06:10 - to set a timeout when doing something
06:12 - like this because if your site isn't
06:14 - responding and it gets hung up then by
06:16 - default the request library will just
06:18 - wait indefinitely so with a timeout set
06:20 - it will only wait that number of seconds
06:22 - that you specified before giving up and
06:24 - throwing an exception so if my site
06:26 - doesn't respond in five seconds then
06:27 - I'll just assume that something's up
06:29 - okay so now I'm going to check to make
06:31 - sure that the response of that request
06:34 - has a status code of 200 so 200 response
06:37 - is a successful response and if the
06:40 - response is an
06:40 - 200 response then I'll want to send
06:43 - myself an email and restart my server so
06:45 - I'm gonna say if our dot
06:48 - status whoops let me spell that right
06:50 - status underscore code is not equal to
06:55 - 200 now the response object also has an
06:58 - attribute called okay which is set to
07:00 - true if the response is less than 400 so
07:04 - I could have also written that like this
07:07 - if not our dot okay but that okay value
07:12 - would be true for any response that
07:14 - isn't you know a 400 or 500 error and I
07:17 - know for sure that I'm expecting a 200
07:19 - response so that's what I'm checking for
07:22 - specifically so I'm not using that
07:25 - okay value that you may have seen in
07:27 - other tutorials okay so if the response
07:29 - isn't a 200 response then first I want
07:32 - to send myself an email letting me know
07:34 - that something is up so to do this we're
07:36 - going to need to use a mail server so
07:38 - I'm going to use my gmail account but
07:40 - you can use whatever you'd like so
07:42 - whatever you use you'll have to look up
07:44 - the instructions online for how to
07:46 - connect to that server so it's pretty
07:48 - simple for Gmail you do need to let
07:50 - Gmail know that you're going to be
07:52 - connecting to your account through a
07:54 - program and I have the instructions
07:56 - pulled up here in the browser as well so
07:59 - if you don't have to factor
08:01 - authentication then you can just go to
08:03 - your Google settings and allow
08:05 - connection through less secure apps so
08:08 - this is at my account Google comm ford
08:11 - slash less secure apps and I'll put
08:13 - links to these in the description
08:14 - sections below but I do have two factor
08:17 - authentication on my machine so in order
08:21 - to connect to your account while you
08:24 - have two-factor authentication then
08:26 - you're going to need to create a
08:27 - password specifically for our app and
08:30 - you can do that through this account
08:32 - here my account Google comm forward
08:35 - slash app passwords and I will put a
08:38 - link to this URL in the description
08:41 - section below as well and you can see
08:43 - here that in my app passwords I created
08:45 - one called Python tests that I use for
08:48 - connecting through Python applications
08:50 - now like I said I'll put a link in the
08:52 - description section below to both of
08:53 - these Google pages
08:54 - if you want to know how to set this up
08:55 - for yourself so once you have your
08:58 - Google security settings in order then
09:00 - we connect to the Google Mail server
09:02 - with the built-in SMTP Lib module in
09:06 - Python so first I'm going to import that
09:08 - at the top of our script so I'll pull
09:11 - this back up and right above request I'm
09:15 - going to say import SMTP Lib and save
09:18 - that and now to set this up to send an
09:21 - email within my conditional here I'm
09:24 - going to say with SMTP Lib dot SMTP and
09:29 - the mail server here is going to be
09:32 - smtp.gmail.com and for the second
09:36 - argument we pass in the port so this is
09:38 - going to be 587 and this is on their
09:41 - documentation online so I don't actually
09:43 - memorize this stuff I have references to
09:47 - this how this works okay so now we have
09:50 - this SMTP connection to their mail
09:53 - server so now we're gonna say SMTP now
09:58 - the e hlo method just identifies
10:01 - ourselves with the mail server that
10:02 - we're using and now we want to encrypt
10:05 - our traffic so to do that I can say SMTP
10:09 - what not SMTP Lib SMTP dot start TLS and
10:15 - that's going to be a method and then we
10:18 - need to rerun that eh ello method again
10:21 - to re identify ourselves as an encrypted
10:23 - connection so I would just copy that and
10:26 - paste it in there okay and now that
10:30 - we're encrypted we can login to our mail
10:32 - server so I'm going to come down here
10:34 - and say SMTP dot
10:36 - in and now at this point we can put in
10:38 - our email address and password now you
10:41 - can put this directly in the script if
10:43 - you'd like but I think it's a good habit
10:45 - never to put sensitive information like
10:47 - this into a script directly I think that
10:49 - you should always put sensitive
10:51 - information like this either in a
10:53 - configuration file somewhere that isn't
10:55 - committed to source code or in
10:58 - environment variables so for this video
11:00 - I've put my credentials inside
11:02 - environment variables so that I don't
11:04 - have to write them out here on video for
11:05 - everyone to see now if you've never used
11:07 - environment
11:08 - variables to hide information like this
11:10 - then I do have a separate video to show
11:12 - how to do that for Mac Linux and Windows
11:14 - so I'll leave a link to those videos in
11:16 - the description section below if anyone
11:18 - would like to see how that's done
11:20 - but I've already put those environment
11:22 - variables created with that information
11:24 - so I can load those in by importing the
11:27 - OS module so up here at the top I'm
11:29 - going to say import OS and at the top of
11:33 - my file here I'm going to create some
11:36 - variables using those environment
11:37 - variables so I'm going to create one
11:40 - called
11:41 - email address and I'm going to set that
11:43 - equal to Oh s dot environment that's how
11:47 - you get environment variables and I
11:50 - created these environment variables and
11:52 - I called them email underscore user and
11:55 - now
11:56 - let me create another variable here
11:58 - called email underscore password and the
12:03 - environment variable for that was email
12:06 - underscore Pass so again you're going to
12:08 - have to create your own environment
12:09 - variables called you know for your email
12:12 - address and for your email password or
12:14 - you can put those in a configuration
12:15 - variable file somewhere any way that you
12:18 - want to do that okay so now I'm going to
12:20 - login to the gmail server using those
12:23 - credentials so that's what we pass in
12:25 - here to SMTP in so first I'm going to
12:28 - pass in the email address then I'm gonna
12:30 - pass in the email password okay so now
12:34 - let's create a simple message for our
12:35 - email so I'm just going to create a
12:38 - simple plain text email in this video
12:40 - and I'll be doing a more advanced email
12:42 - video in the near future where we cover
12:44 - attachments and HTML messages and things
12:46 - like that but for this video we just
12:49 - want text so first I'm going to create a
12:51 - subject line since this will be an email
12:54 - about my website being down I'm gonna
12:56 - make it something that will catch my eye
12:58 - so I will just say subject is equal to
13:02 - and I'll just do all caps your site is
13:05 - down with an exclamation point there and
13:08 - for the body of the website I'm just
13:10 - going to put something here like you
13:13 - know make sure the server restarted and
13:17 - it is back up okay and now I'm going to
13:21 - combine at this
13:22 - and body into a single message so when
13:25 - you're constructing a plaintext email
13:26 - from scratch you need to add the subject
13:29 - as a header and then have a couple of
13:31 - blank lines and then put the body of the
13:33 - message so I'm going to do this using an
13:35 - EPS tring so I will just say msg is
13:38 - equal to and to do an F string you do F
13:41 - and then your string so I'll say subject
13:44 - and then pass in that subject and then
13:49 - I'll do a couple of blank lines here and
13:51 - now I will pass in the body and again
13:54 - I'm not going into as much step-by-step
13:56 - detail in this video but if you've never
13:58 - used F strings before I think that
14:00 - they're really nice to work with and I
14:02 - have any more in-depth video on that
14:03 - topic and I'll leave a link to that in
14:06 - the description section below if you'd
14:07 - like to learn more about those okay so
14:09 - now I just have to send this email now
14:12 - that we've created this message so I can
14:15 - do that here by using this format I can
14:19 - say sm t p dot send mail and then we're
14:24 - going to want to send this to the sender
14:26 - and the receiver and then the message so
14:30 - we want to put the sender here and the
14:32 - receiver here so for the sender we're
14:35 - going to want this to be the email
14:37 - address that we logged in as now you can
14:40 - put a different value there but I
14:42 - wouldn't recommend it you don't want to
14:45 - you know spoof what email this is coming
14:47 - from because it's against the rules
14:49 - first of all for imitating someone and
14:52 - second of all it's probably just gonna
14:54 - wind up in spam I mean they they have
14:56 - things in place that catch this kind of
14:58 - stuff okay so we're putting the sender
15:00 - as the email address that we logged in
15:02 - as and the receiver I'm just putting as
15:05 - myself also so I could put the email
15:08 - address here as well but just to be more
15:11 - clear let me act like I'm actually
15:13 - sending this to someone different but so
15:16 - I'm gonna put in Cory M Schaefer at
15:18 - gmail.com which is my email address but
15:20 - that is actually the same as what this
15:22 - email address is as well okay so that
15:24 - should send our email if our site is
15:26 - down now we can test this by commenting
15:28 - out the if statement and onion denting
15:31 - our email section so if I do that let me
15:34 - just comment out the
15:36 - if statement for now and unand dint the
15:39 - email section here so there's no
15:41 - conditional that won't send this email
15:43 - so if I go ahead and run this code then
15:47 - we don't have any output here but if I
15:50 - wait a second then I should get an email
15:53 - that comes through so I have my gmail
15:56 - pulled up here on my phone and I can see
16:00 - that I did just get an email that came
16:02 - through with the message that we
16:05 - specified so that works well okay so now
16:08 - let's set this back up to how it was
16:10 - within the with statement so I will
16:13 - indent that back and uncomment out the
16:16 - conditional there now also I should
16:18 - mention that in sublime whenever you run
16:22 - code you have to have a build system and
16:25 - I have my build system set to my virtual
16:29 - environment that I created at the
16:31 - beginning of this video so that is why
16:32 - that worked if you don't have your your
16:36 - build system set up to your virtual
16:37 - environment then you'll have to set that
16:38 - in sublime but if that's too much of a
16:41 - hassle for you then you can always come
16:43 - back here to your terminal and just run
16:45 - that manually so you could say Python
16:47 - monitor dot and whoops monitor dot py
16:51 - and run the script that way okay so let
16:54 - me go back to the script here okay so
16:56 - now we've sent ourselves an email when
16:58 - the site is not responding with a 200
17:01 - status code but now I'm going to use the
17:03 - Llano di thon library to reboot my low
17:06 - note server so in order to interact with
17:08 - milah note account programmatically I'm
17:10 - going to need to create an API token
17:12 - through my account so I have my lenôtre
17:16 - open here let me exit out of that okay
17:19 - so I've got my note account open here so
17:22 - in order to create an API token we need
17:25 - to first go to our profile so to get to
17:28 - the profile I'm going to click on my
17:29 - profile picture up here at the top right
17:31 - and then I can go to my profile so
17:35 - within here we can click on the tab that
17:38 - says API tokens so I'm going to click on
17:42 - that and we can see here that we have a
17:44 - section for personal access tokens now I
17:47 - don't have any here right now but we can
17:49 - create
17:50 - by clicking add a personal access token
17:53 - so I will create one and for the label
17:57 - of this token I'll just call this
17:58 - lenôtre
17:59 - - Python - token and now I'm going to
18:04 - set the expiration date to never if you
18:06 - want this to be you know more secure and
18:08 - have expiration dates then you can set
18:10 - those up however you want and I'm going
18:12 - to give this readwrite access to
18:14 - everything on my account so now if I
18:17 - scroll down here I can submit that token
18:20 - and now it's going to pop up with the
18:23 - API access token so I'm going to copy
18:26 - this now this token actually won't be
18:30 - visible anymore after I close this so
18:32 - you want to be sure that you copy this
18:34 - down or write it down somewhere so I'm
18:38 - going to click OK here and now we have
18:40 - our a node python token here within our
18:43 - personal access tokens now don't worry
18:45 - I'm going to delete this token after the
18:48 - video and create a new one so that no
18:50 - one can access my account using this
18:53 - token that we saw in this video but I'll
18:55 - use this one for now okay so at this
18:58 - point I'm going to create another
18:59 - environment variable for this API token
19:02 - so I'm not going to show that here on
19:04 - video since my email credentials are in
19:07 - there also but like I said if anyone
19:09 - doesn't know how to set environment
19:10 - variables then there's a link to those
19:13 - videos in the description section below
19:15 - on how to do that okay so I'm going to
19:18 - pull up my terminal here and I'm going
19:21 - to pause the video while I add that
19:24 - token to my environment variables and
19:25 - I'll pick it up after I've added that
19:27 - token okay so I went in and I set an
19:30 - environment variable called lenôtre
19:32 - token to that token that I got from the
19:35 - node so now I can use that to interact
19:38 - with my lono to count through python so
19:41 - now let's go back to my script and I'll
19:42 - show you how this works so let me open
19:44 - the script here so first let's import
19:47 - that 'la note client so to do that up
19:50 - here at the top where we're doing our
19:52 - imports I can say from the node
19:55 - underscore API for import 'la note
20:00 - client and now I'm just going to grab
20:03 - that
20:03 - varmint variable that I just set and
20:06 - I'll just put this under the email
20:08 - address and password so I'll say 'la
20:11 - node underscore token is equal to and
20:15 - we'll just do another OS dot environment
20:19 - but this environment variable
20:22 - I set as 'la node underscore token now
20:25 - one important thing is that you usually
20:26 - need to restart everything after you set
20:29 - an environment variable so that those
20:31 - changes can take effect some people
20:33 - don't do that and then they wonder why
20:35 - they can't see their variable that they
20:36 - just set so if you haven't restarted
20:39 - then it's probably not going to pick up
20:41 - those changes so for example let me
20:43 - comment out everything below here and
20:46 - try to print out my environment variable
20:51 - that I just set so I'm going to print
20:53 - out that whoops that 'la note token and
20:57 - let me try to save that and run it and
21:01 - actually I do get a response there which
21:03 - I shouldn't have I should have restarted
21:06 - this before I started recording this
21:07 - video but this actually isn't the Llano
21:11 - token that we just created this is one
21:13 - that I created earlier whenever I was
21:15 - testing all the stuff for the video so
21:18 - most likely if you haven't restarted
21:20 - then you'll get a nun response there so
21:23 - once I restart this we're going to get
21:25 - the new token so you can see this one is
21:27 - 6 to be 9 5 e so when I restart this so
21:32 - let me restart sublime and open this
21:35 - back up so sublime in the current
21:38 - directory open that back up open my
21:40 - monitor script now let me run this again
21:44 - and we can see that now this is a
21:46 - different token it picked up those
21:47 - changes this one is 8 to b61 blah blah
21:50 - blah blah blah and you're gonna want to
21:51 - do that in your terminal as well I'm not
21:54 - sure let's see if I run this script now
21:57 - with python monitor dot py yeah so I'm
22:00 - still getting that old token with this
22:03 - terminal as well so I would have to open
22:07 - a new terminal and CD into that site
22:12 - monitor and then I would have to
22:13 - activate my virtual environment again so
22:15 - activate monitor underscore
22:17 - env Binh activate and now if I did
22:22 - Python monitor dot py ran that then we
22:26 - get the new token so now let me resize
22:30 - this here and delete this other terminal
22:35 - that we had open okay so now we are
22:38 - getting our correct token value so now
22:41 - I'm going to leave everything commented
22:43 - out below this while I show you how we
22:45 - can restart a low note server through
22:47 - Python and after we get that working
22:49 - then I'll put that logic in the correct
22:51 - place so first let's connect to the node
22:55 - through our client so we can do that I'm
22:58 - going to remove this print statement so
23:00 - I'm going to say client is equal to the
23:02 - node client that we imported right here
23:05 - and we need to create or pass in sorry
23:11 - we need to pass in this lenôtre
23:14 - token so we're connecting to this Linode
23:18 - client passing in Batlin owed token and
23:21 - now I'm going to print out some
23:23 - information about milah node servers I
23:25 - only have one active server at the
23:27 - moment so we should just see that one
23:29 - here but to do this I'm going to say for
23:31 - the node in client dot 'la note dot
23:37 - instances and within that for loop I'm
23:42 - going to print out the node label and
23:44 - the ID of each instance which I said
23:47 - will just be the one instance for now so
23:50 - I'll say print and I'll use an F string
23:53 - here again whoops an F string and I will
23:56 - print out first the Lynott label then I
24:00 - will do a colon and a space and then I
24:03 - will print out the Leonard
24:05 - I do so let's save that and run it and
24:09 - we can see usually it takes longer than
24:12 - that but we can see that it basically
24:14 - immediately came back with my query MS
24:16 - server and then this is the ID of that
24:18 - server now I'm gonna want to copy that
24:21 - ID so that I can just connect to that
24:23 - single instance in order to reboot it so
24:26 - to do that first I have to import
24:30 - instance up
24:31 - here so we are importing the note client
24:34 - we also want to import instance and now
24:38 - I'm going to copy that ID from the
24:40 - output so let's copy that and now I can
24:44 - connect to the low note with that ID
24:46 - just by saying and I'm going to get rid
24:50 - of my for loop here so we can just say
24:53 - my server is equal to client dot load
24:59 - and we want to load an instance so we're
25:04 - using instance that we imported there
25:06 - and now I'm going to pass in the ID of
25:09 - the instance that we want to connect to
25:11 - so now that I've loaded that particular
25:14 - load I should be able to reboot that
25:16 - machine simply by saying my server dot
25:22 - reboot so let me make this output a
25:25 - little bit smaller here so that we can
25:27 - see a little bit more so now I'm going
25:30 - to run this and I'm going to open up
25:32 - Milan ode account and check that that
25:34 - machine is actually rebooting so I will
25:37 - save that and run it so it should be
25:40 - rebooting that server with that ID so
25:44 - let me open up Milan ode account here go
25:47 - to my dashboard now it doesn't look like
25:49 - it is rebooting yet but let me click on
25:53 - there and this will give me details and
25:55 - we can see that the details here it
25:57 - actually does say that it's rebooting
25:59 - now so that did work in that script so
26:02 - sometimes that can take a bit before
26:04 - that reboot actually gets triggered but
26:07 - if we wait for a bit then we should see
26:09 - it get started okay so now that server
26:13 - is going to reboot and that was
26:15 - triggered through our Python program so
26:18 - that's great the script is working well
26:20 - so far so let me go back to the script
26:23 - here so now let's take all that logic
26:26 - that we use to reboot our machine and
26:28 - move that into our conditional for if
26:31 - our website isn't returning a response
26:34 - code of 200 so I'm going to take just
26:37 - these three lines here and cut those out
26:41 - and now I'm going to uncomment out what
26:44 - we had
26:45 - before where we sent our email and
26:47 - actually I'm not sure at what point this
26:49 - got uninvented here
26:51 - it was probably whenever I checked it to
26:54 - send the email but this should actually
26:55 - be indented here within this context
26:58 - manager so we want to push that here
27:00 - within the width statement okay but
27:02 - after that email is sent let's go down
27:06 - here and we want to backspace to where
27:09 - we are not within that context manager
27:12 - now I'm going to paste in those lines
27:14 - get this indentation correctly here let
27:17 - me just put all of these together since
27:19 - they are logically the same so we're
27:22 - connecting to that low note client
27:24 - loading up the instance and rebooting
27:27 - that server and that is all within the
27:29 - conditional of if our status code is not
27:32 - equal to 200 now if you're wondering how
27:35 - I knew how to use the low note Python
27:37 - library really you just have to take the
27:39 - time to read through the documentation
27:41 - on stuff like that there's a lot more
27:43 - that you can do with that API if you're
27:45 - interested
27:46 - honestly this is basically all that I've
27:48 - used that library for so I'm interested
27:50 - in learning more about it myself
27:52 - okay so now we have a script that should
27:55 - send us an email and restart our server
27:57 - if our site doesn't respond with a 200
28:00 - code so now let's test this out so in
28:03 - order to test this let me change the URL
28:05 - that I'm requesting to a page that won't
28:07 - respond with a 200 response so for
28:10 - example just let me go to a route that
28:13 - doesn't exist and that's going to return
28:15 - a 404 response and since that isn't a
28:18 - 200 response then it should send me an
28:20 - email and then restart my server so I'm
28:23 - just going to go up here and change the
28:25 - route that we're trying to connect to
28:27 - and I'm just going to do a forward slash
28:28 - DNA 4 does not exist so if I run this
28:32 - then we don't get any output here but if
28:36 - I check my email I'm looking at my email
28:39 - here on my phone and that email did come
28:43 - through that said your site is down make
28:45 - sure that the server restarted and is
28:47 - back up so if I go back to Milan ode
28:51 - page here then we can see that this
28:52 - reboot has already started on that
28:54 - machine so it's rebooting again so it
28:57 - does look like our site
28:58 - worked in that sense and we also get 'la
29:00 - note notifications here that tell us
29:03 - when these servers are rebooting so we
29:06 - can see one was five minutes ago and one
29:08 - was a few seconds ago and then four days
29:10 - ago from when I was testing the script
29:13 - okay so now let me go back to our script
29:16 - here now one thing that I could probably
29:20 - add to the script is some feedback or
29:23 - logging so that we can see when events
29:25 - like this are triggered but for now I
29:28 - can just expect an email and can also
29:30 - look at Milan ode to see if it's
29:32 - rebooting okay so now that I know that
29:34 - that works I'm going to set this page
29:36 - back here to a to my home page rather
29:41 - than a page that doesn't exist
29:43 - okay so there's actually one more thing
29:44 - that we need to do with this script here
29:46 - so right now we are sending in the email
29:49 - and restarting the server if we don't
29:53 - get a status code of 200 but sometimes
29:57 - we won't even get a status code at all
30:00 - it's possible that requests not get is
30:02 - going to throw an exception so for
30:05 - example if it times out it's going to
30:07 - throw an exception or if the server is
30:08 - down completely then it's going to throw
30:10 - an exception and we are not handling
30:13 - that right now so what we're gonna do
30:16 - let's put in a try except block to where
30:18 - if there's any exceptions then we go
30:20 - ahead and send this email and restart
30:22 - the server and also if we do get a
30:25 - response code then we'll check if that
30:26 - is a 200 response or not so I think the
30:30 - best thing to do here is to move all of
30:33 - this functionality into a function so
30:36 - that we can run this in multiple
30:38 - scenarios so here at the top of my
30:40 - script underneath my environment
30:42 - variables I'm going to create two
30:44 - different functions here so I'll call
30:46 - one of these let's see notify user
30:50 - something like that and I don't think we
30:53 - need any arguments into this function
30:56 - I'm just going to take all of our email
30:59 - stuff here and I will cut that out and
31:01 - I'm going to put all of that here within
31:04 - this notify user function so now and we
31:09 - could add arguments to this function if
31:11 - we wanted to
31:12 - so for example you know we could put a
31:15 - custom a custom sender and receiver here
31:18 - for the email something like that all of
31:21 - this is just hard coded into this script
31:23 - for my personal example so I'm just
31:25 - gonna leave it as is but if you wanted
31:27 - to customize it and make this you know
31:29 - more customizable then you could add
31:32 - those in here okay so I'm going to call
31:34 - that notify user and then I will create
31:37 - another function here and I will call
31:40 - this reboot server and again I'm just
31:44 - going to take the code from there and
31:48 - put it into this function here so now I
31:53 - can just say when our status code is not
31:57 - equal to 200 we want to notify the user
31:59 - and we want to reboot the server and now
32:03 - that we have those in functions now we
32:06 - can also check if we get an exception
32:08 - and do the same thing if we hit an
32:10 - exception here so I'm going to create a
32:13 - try and accept block here so I'll just
32:15 - do a basic try except now I'm going to
32:18 - copy where we are doing this request and
32:21 - I will paste that into our try block so
32:25 - what we're doing is we are trying this
32:27 - code here and if we hit an exception and
32:30 - I'm just going to leave this as any
32:32 - exception there are different exceptions
32:34 - and you can you know get more in depth
32:37 - with this and more specific if you want
32:39 - but I'm just going to say if we hit any
32:41 - exception then that means that our
32:44 - request wasn't successful so I'm going
32:47 - to want to notify myself and I'm going
32:49 - to go ahead and try to reboot my server
32:51 - anyways so again what we're saying here
32:53 - is we are trying to make this request if
32:55 - we get an exception I want to send that
32:57 - email and reboot the server if that
33:00 - success or if we did get a response then
33:03 - we're checking ok this is the response
33:05 - that we got a 200 response if not then I
33:08 - want you to also send that email and and
33:10 - reboot the server so to test this let me
33:14 - actually log into Milan ode and I will
33:16 - go ahead and just stop apache completely
33:19 - and that should cause us not to get a
33:22 - response at all and then we'll see and
33:24 - that will
33:26 - make an exception and then we'll see if
33:28 - it also sends the email and reboots our
33:30 - server in that case so let me try this
33:32 - out I'm actually SSH into Milan ode
33:35 - machine right here and this is my server
33:38 - and currently I have Apache running here
33:41 - so let me try to just stop Apache so I
33:45 - need to put in my password there now it
33:48 - says stopping web server so I just took
33:51 - down my personal website and now I
33:54 - shouldn't get any response at all so now
33:56 - let's try to run this code again and we
34:01 - don't get any output here oh actually we
34:04 - did get an error here yeah so I know
34:07 - what this is this was a dumb mistake
34:08 - some of you probably caught it before I
34:10 - even did it but if we get an error here
34:14 - then this but our variable here is never
34:18 - even going to be set to begin with so
34:20 - I'm gonna put this up here within my try
34:23 - block as well so now if we get an
34:28 - exception thrown on here then it's going
34:30 - to hop down here and send the email and
34:33 - reboot the server if we didn't get an
34:35 - exception that'll continue on and check
34:37 - the status code and send the email and
34:40 - reboot the server the reason that it
34:43 - threw an error when that was located
34:44 - outside of the try accept block is
34:46 - because if this is an error right here
34:48 - then that never gets set that our
34:51 - variable never gets set so when we were
34:53 - trying to access it down here it didn't
34:55 - know what it was okay so now let me try
34:58 - to save and run that script again now it
35:01 - probably did send that email and it
35:03 - probably did reboot my server because it
35:06 - still hit that exception before it ran
35:07 - into that error so let me check my email
35:12 - here well it really quick yet I can see
35:14 - that my site actually is down and if I
35:17 - go back to Milan ode it may have already
35:20 - restarted actually yes it did it was
35:24 - started two minutes ago so let's run
35:26 - this again and see if this works so I'll
35:30 - run that now we shouldn't get any output
35:33 - and if I check my email now this might
35:38 - actually
35:39 - not be down because when it restarted it
35:42 - probably restarted Apache as well so let
35:46 - me try to log back in to Milan Oh
35:49 - shut that down and try it one more time
35:52 - okay so I paused the video and I signed
35:57 - back in to Milan ode server here and now
36:00 - let me do the same thing again
36:02 - so when it restarted if I run Apache
36:04 - status once I restarted the server it
36:07 - started Apache again so let me stop that
36:10 - okay it stopped and now let's run the
36:14 - script again it's going to hit this
36:16 - exception and send the email okay so run
36:20 - this we don't get any output which is
36:22 - what we expect I'm looking at my phone
36:24 - here and I just got an email that says
36:26 - that my site is down and that the server
36:28 - is restarting so if we open this back up
36:31 - we just got a notification that a few
36:33 - seconds ago that we scheduled a reboot
36:36 - and we can see that the machine is
36:38 - rebooting here and down here I am
36:41 - getting this notification that I just
36:43 - got kicked out of my SSH session and
36:45 - that is because the server is now down
36:48 - but once that reboots then our website
36:53 - will be working so we can see here that
36:55 - my website is down because Apache was
36:58 - stopped and once this finishes rebooting
37:00 - then my site should be up so I'm gonna
37:03 - pause the video and wait for this to
37:05 - finish and then I'll go and try my
37:07 - website again okay so I paused the video
37:09 - there for a second and let the reboot
37:12 - finish and now I'm logged back into
37:15 - Milan ode server here and now if I check
37:18 - the Apache status now it is running so
37:22 - if I go back to my website here and try
37:24 - to reload this then now this loads up
37:28 - just the way it should everything is
37:29 - working nicely so we can see that's a
37:31 - nice feature there that if our Apache
37:36 - even shuts down for any reason
37:38 - whatsoever then it's just going to
37:41 - automatically try to restart so I think
37:44 - that is a pretty nice feature that we
37:46 - added in there okay so now I have a
37:48 - working script that I can run anytime
37:51 - that I want to check the status of my
37:52 - website
37:53 - and we'll perform those actions if there
37:55 - are any issues but what if I want to run
37:58 - this script every ten minutes or so so
38:00 - that this process of checking the
38:01 - website is automated so I don't want to
38:04 - have to actually run this script
38:05 - manually every time I want to check my
38:07 - website the point is that something is
38:10 - monitoring our website for us so in
38:12 - order to do this we're going to need to
38:14 - use some sort of task scheduler now
38:17 - again I am on Mac oops this is I want to
38:22 - go ahead and exit that session there so
38:24 - like I was saying I am on a Mac so the
38:27 - task scheduler used on Mac and Linux is
38:29 - called cron now if you're on Windows
38:31 - then I believe it's actually called task
38:33 - scheduler so you can use the scheduler
38:37 - for your operating system but since I'm
38:40 - on a Mac I'm going to use cron so let's
38:42 - say that we want to run our website
38:44 - check every 10 minutes
38:46 - so first what command do we actually
38:48 - want to run so remember we created a
38:52 - virtual environment for our little
38:54 - project here now when we installed all
38:56 - those packages we installed them in our
38:59 - virtual environment so that is the
39:00 - version of Python that we need to run
39:02 - our script with so that it has access to
39:05 - those specific packages now we have our
39:07 - environment activated now but if we
39:09 - don't have our environment activated
39:11 - then we can simply run our script with
39:13 - the Python executable from that
39:16 - environment so to do this we just need
39:18 - to specify the path to that Python
39:21 - version so on my machine that would look
39:26 - like this so with the environment
39:28 - activated I can say which Python and we
39:30 - can see that it gives us the full path
39:33 - to the Python from that environment that
39:36 - is activated now this is just my home
39:39 - folder here so a short version of this I
39:41 - could just use a tilde and then copy the
39:44 - rest after this and if I run that then
39:47 - we can see that it just runs that
39:49 - version of Python so I can you know
39:51 - import requests and that should work
39:53 - because we have pip installed that
39:57 - inside that environment so that is the
40:00 - Python command that we're going to run
40:02 - and we're also going to want to specify
40:04 - the full path to the script as well
40:07 - since we don't want to rely on it being
40:09 - from a relative direct directory so on
40:12 - my machine the path to that script would
40:14 - be the home folder in site monitor and
40:19 - that is monitor whoops monitor dot py so
40:23 - the entire command if I paste in what I
40:27 - had before whoops let me put the home
40:29 - folder there so this is going to be the
40:31 - entire command that we're going to run
40:33 - every ten minutes so we have the full
40:36 - path to the Python executable for that
40:39 - virtual environment and the full path to
40:42 - the script that we want to run so if I
40:45 - run that then it just ran that script
40:48 - with that version of Python and we can
40:50 - see that that ran very quickly and the
40:52 - reason that it ran very quickly is
40:54 - because it went out to my site and got a
40:55 - 200 response since the site is working
40:58 - and it didn't do any of the emails or
41:01 - restarts or anything like that so
41:03 - hopefully that's what it's going to do
41:05 - most often when it runs is just run very
41:08 - quickly like this okay so I'm going to
41:10 - copy this entire command and that's what
41:13 - I'm going to schedule to run every 10
41:16 - minutes so on my machine I can access
41:20 - cron from the command line by saying
41:22 - crontab - e that's - II for edit and you
41:27 - can see that I don't currently have
41:28 - anything in my crontab right now now by
41:31 - default cron opens up in the vim editor
41:33 - now if you aren't comfortable in them
41:35 - then you can change the editor to Nano
41:38 - or something like that now I felt like
41:41 - I've said this a lot during this video
41:42 - but I'm not going into the details of
41:45 - cron here but I do have a detailed video
41:47 - tutorial on using cron and I'll leave a
41:50 - link to that video in the description
41:51 - section below also if you'd like to
41:53 - learn more about cron in depth but for
41:56 - now let me just write out this cron
41:58 - schedule and then I'll explain exactly
42:00 - what it's doing so in vim if you want to
42:03 - insert something then you have to hit I
42:05 - first and we can see down here that it
42:07 - says insert so now I'm going to type out
42:10 - this schedule so for this schedule I'm
42:12 - going to do an asterisk ford slash tin
42:15 - space asterisks space asterisk space
42:18 - estrus space asterisks
42:20 - so basically the schedule that we have
42:22 - here will run our command every 10
42:25 - minutes on every day of the year so the
42:27 - first value here is what minute we want
42:30 - to execute our command
42:31 - the asterisk forged slash means that we
42:34 - want to run this command every 10
42:36 - minutes now the next value here the
42:38 - second asterisk is the value for the
42:42 - hour
42:43 - so our asterisk is saying that we want
42:46 - to run at every hour the next value is
42:48 - for the day of the month so this is
42:51 - every day of the month the next value is
42:53 - for the month so we set it to every
42:55 - month and the last value here is the day
42:57 - of the week
42:58 - so this is set to run on any day of the
43:00 - week so that's our schedule and this
43:04 - will run a command every 10 minutes
43:07 - so now let's tell it what command we
43:09 - want to run every 10 minutes so I copied
43:11 - that long command from my terminal from
43:13 - before and I'm just going to paste this
43:15 - in here ok and that is our entire cron
43:18 - schedule so now I just want to save this
43:20 - so in vim to save I can just press
43:23 - escape and that takes us out of insert
43:25 - mode and now I can press : WQ 4 whoops
43:30 - WQ 4 right and quit so I will run that
43:33 - it's going to tell me that this wants to
43:36 - do some administration I'll just click
43:38 - OK now it says installing new crontab
43:41 - and if you ever want to list out your
43:42 - crontab schedule then you can say
43:44 - crontab - l and that'll show us all of
43:47 - the commands that we are running and on
43:49 - what schedule okay so now that script
43:52 - should run every 10 minutes so that
43:55 - should be it now it would be nice to
43:57 - have some sort of feedback where we
43:59 - could go and check from time to time to
44:01 - make sure that our script is running so
44:03 - that's another reason why it would be a
44:05 - good idea to add some logging into that
44:07 - script so that we could occasionally
44:09 - check the logs and make sure that
44:11 - everything is running properly you know
44:12 - make sure that it goes out and makes the
44:14 - request and any time it runs into errors
44:17 - or anything like that and there's
44:19 - probably a lot more that we could add to
44:20 - that script as well but I think I'm
44:22 - happy with what I have here for now and
44:24 - if I need to add to it in the future
44:26 - then we can build from there now I will
44:28 - put this script up on github if anyone
44:32 - wanted to follow along but
44:34 - didn't necessarily want to write
44:36 - everything out here so I will have a
44:38 - link to this in github as well and again
44:40 - like I was saying before if you want to
44:42 - write a script like this that monitors
44:43 - one of your websites then you're gonna
44:45 - have to change some of the environment
44:47 - variables here so you're gonna have to
44:49 - have your email username and password to
44:51 - send the email and a token for whatever
44:54 - service you're using I'm using the node
44:56 - but I'm sure you know probably
44:58 - digitalocean and other services have
45:00 - something like this as well okay so I
45:02 - think that is going to do it for this
45:03 - video like I said this video is a bit
45:05 - different than the tutorial set I
45:07 - usually cover we didn't go into as much
45:09 - step-by-step detail here but I get a lot
45:12 - of requests from people who want me to
45:13 - record little scripts like this that are
45:15 - you know quick dirty solutions to some
45:17 - daily problems that I run into so that's
45:20 - really what I was shooting for here but
45:22 - if anyone has any questions about what
45:24 - we covered in this video then feel free
