00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video i'm going to show you how to
00:04 - quickly resize a lot of images using
00:07 - your terminal on your mac
00:10 - now i understand a lot of people don't
00:12 - like to use a terminal i used to not
00:13 - like to use a lot
00:15 - so if you're looking for another way to
00:17 - resize a lot of images
00:19 - like in an application or something i do
00:21 - have another video where i show how to
00:24 - do that in an application called picasa
00:26 - so if you're interested in that i will
00:28 - post the link to that video in the
00:30 - description
00:32 - but with that said i've never seen an
00:34 - easier way to resize a lot of images
00:38 - than this method that i'm going to show
00:39 - you in the terminal
00:40 - so with that let's go ahead and get
00:42 - started
00:43 - you can see here on my desktop i have
00:45 - three folders large medium and small if
00:47 - i open up this large folder
00:49 - all of these images that i have in here
00:51 - if i open these up in a preview
00:53 - then you can see that they're all high
00:55 - resolution high resolution large photos
01:00 - so
01:01 - what if we want to maybe for your
01:03 - website you want a large version of a
01:05 - photo a medium version and a small
01:08 - version that happens a lot especially
01:09 - whenever you're doing galleries and you
01:11 - need thumbnails or something like that
01:13 - so let's go ahead and i'm going to show
01:16 - you two different ways and how to do
01:17 - this if we open up this medium folder
01:20 - the first way i'm going to show you is
01:21 - by altering the original photo so i'm
01:24 - going to copy these
01:26 - and then i'm going to paste them into
01:28 - this medium folder
01:30 - and now these are still the same large
01:32 - photos in the medium folder so now let's
01:35 - close this down
01:37 - and now in my terminal here i'm going to
01:40 - right now i'm on my desktop if i do an
01:42 - ls command you can see this medium
01:44 - folder here i'm going to change
01:46 - directory directory into the medium
01:48 - folder
01:49 - now if i do another ls command
01:52 - now you can see all of my jpeg images
01:55 - now the ma the command that i'm going to
01:57 - use to change the size of all these
01:59 - photos is super easy it's just sips sips
02:04 - and then this capital z option and what
02:07 - the capital z option does is it
02:09 - maintains the aspect ratio because we
02:11 - don't want
02:12 - our pictures um
02:13 - you know getting elongated or anything
02:16 - like that with weird widths and heights
02:18 - so we wanted to maintain that aspect
02:19 - ratio
02:20 - so since this is a medium picture let's
02:23 - set this to 640 pixels
02:26 - um
02:26 - and the what we want to change is
02:29 - everything in this folder that's what
02:31 - the star is the wild card so everything
02:33 - in this folder with a dot jpeg and
02:35 - that's it let's just go ahead and hit
02:37 - enter
02:38 - and you see it'll go ahead and start
02:40 - that list and go through all those
02:42 - images
02:43 - now if i come over here to my folder
02:46 - and
02:47 - i select all these files and preview
02:50 - them now you can see that they're all
02:52 - resized to 640 pixels
02:55 - so now
02:57 - let me show you how to do this
03:00 - without altering the original
03:03 - so first let me change directory back to
03:06 - my
03:08 - large folder with all the large original
03:10 - images
03:11 - and if you remember last time whenever
03:14 - we did the medium photos first we copied
03:16 - all the larges and put them into the
03:18 - medium folder
03:19 - but now i'm going to show you we're in
03:21 - the large folder and i'm going to show
03:23 - you how to
03:26 - resize these images and put them
03:28 - directly into the small folder
03:31 - without doing any copying first
03:33 - so i'm just going to hit the up arrow a
03:35 - couple of times in my terminal to get
03:37 - back to that sips command and now since
03:40 - we're going to do the small photos i'm
03:41 - going to take these down to about 300
03:43 - pixels
03:45 - and now it's the exact same command but
03:47 - right now we're in the large folder if
03:49 - we hit enter right now it would over
03:51 - write all of our large images with the
03:53 - 300 pixel images
03:55 - but instead you can put this
03:58 - out option on to the end and that's
04:00 - going to be an output directory of where
04:03 - all these images go so i can just put
04:05 - this onto my desktop and within the
04:08 - desktop i'm going to put that in this
04:10 - directory called small so i'll go ahead
04:13 - and hit enter
04:14 - and you can see
04:15 - it goes through all those images and now
04:17 - if i go over here and open up my small
04:19 - folder
04:20 - then we can see all the pictures are
04:22 - here and if i open them up in preview
04:24 - you can see that they are
04:26 - small 300 pixel images
04:30 - and so now basically at this point if
04:32 - all you're trying to do is resize your
04:34 - images then you're done you have your
04:38 - folder here with your large and then
04:39 - your medium and your small and you can
04:41 - resize those to any pixel mounts that
04:43 - you want
04:44 - one thing i want to add on here though
04:46 - is usually when people do this and they
04:48 - do
04:49 - large medium and small versions of their
04:51 - files
04:52 - usually they also want to
04:55 - rename the files because they don't if
04:57 - they're putting them up on their web
04:58 - server they want their large medium and
05:00 - smalls to all be named something
05:02 - different
05:04 - so that's a little outside of the scope
05:05 - of this video so i'm going to show you
05:07 - how to do it but i'm not going to really
05:09 - explain it very
05:10 - very much i have this command here that
05:13 - i've just copied and pasted in here and
05:16 - let me go into
05:18 - first let me go
05:20 - change directory into
05:23 - my
05:24 - small folder
05:26 - and i'm going to
05:28 - rename all these
05:29 - so let me open this up
05:33 - and right now if i was to do an ls on
05:36 - this directory
05:37 - you can see that these are all named
05:40 - exactly the same thing that my large
05:43 - images are named now if we wanted to
05:45 - distinguish these and say
05:48 - okay let me clear this out
05:50 - okay
05:51 - now um pretty much what this does is it
05:53 - finds all the files in this current
05:56 - directory that i'm in you have to make
05:58 - sure that you're within your small
05:59 - directory if you run this command
06:01 - because you don't want it to
06:03 - change files that you don't plan it to
06:04 - change but within the directory
06:07 - that i want to change the file names
06:09 - i execute this statement here that
06:13 - pretty much it will
06:15 - disregard the extension
06:17 - right here and then it's going to tack
06:19 - on a 300 and then it's going to also add
06:23 - back the extension here at the end so if
06:26 - i hit enter there and now i rerun that
06:29 - ls command again
06:31 - now you can see that all the file names
06:33 - here have a 300 tacked onto the end of
06:36 - it um so yeah uh maybe i'll make a video
06:39 - that kind of explains uh the bulk
06:42 - renaming um in more in advance but i
06:45 - thought it was something i should also
06:46 - add to the bulk image resizing since
06:50 - it's most likely something that people
06:52 - are going to want to do with all the
06:54 - resized images is also
06:56 - rename those with the new
06:58 - image sizes
06:59 - so that about does it i hope that this
07:02 - tutorial was useful for you guys if you
07:04 - guys have any questions about this stuff
