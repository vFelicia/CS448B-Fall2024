00:00 - hey everybody how's it going uh I have a
00:03 - quick tip for Sublime Text that I find
00:05 - extremely useful um right now I am over
00:08 - here in Eclipse uh if anybody's everever
00:11 - programmed an eclipse before um you know
00:14 - that they have uh this really nice
00:16 - functionality where you can hold in
00:18 - command and click on a function or
00:20 - method and will and it will take you
00:23 - directly to that definition um it would
00:25 - be nice if Sublime Tex had something
00:28 - like this um they do have some keyboard
00:31 - shortcuts but I really like that uh
00:33 - click functionality uh it's um helps me
00:36 - out with my workflow just to be able to
00:38 - get there a lot quicker um so if I open
00:40 - up Sublime Text here uh you can see that
00:43 - they don't have anything like this if I
00:44 - do control click uh it just does a right
00:47 - click um if I do a command click command
00:50 - click just creates multiple multiple
00:52 - cursors um so in order to set this
00:55 - functionality up we're going to have to
00:57 - uh create a special file and and so if I
01:01 - open up terminal here the directory
01:03 - where we need to create this file is in
01:07 - our home
01:09 - library and then application
01:13 - support Sublime Text
01:15 - 3 and that is in packages and then user
01:20 - so let's go ahead and navigate there and
01:23 - now I already have the name of this file
01:26 - copied to my clipboard and the name of
01:28 - this file is
01:30 - default space and then these parentheses
01:34 - OSX do Sublime Das mous mat so I'm going
01:39 - to create that file oh and it looks like
01:42 - I need to put this in quotes
01:47 - here okay so create that file and now
01:51 - you can open up this up in any text
01:53 - editor of your choice uh I have a
01:55 - Sublime shortcut here in my terminal so
01:58 - I'm going to go ahead and open this up
02:01 - in Sublime Text oh and I forgot that
02:03 - that command is uh just that okay so now
02:09 - I have this file opened up and this is
02:12 - going to be very similar to uh any other
02:14 - of the uh configuration files within
02:16 - Sublime um so we're going to uh open
02:20 - this up here okay and then the first
02:23 - option here is going to be called button
02:27 - and then we want to set this equal to
02:31 - to button
02:33 - one and actually let me make these
02:37 - double
02:42 - quotes our second value here is going to
02:45 - be count and that's going to be
02:49 - one the next one is going to be called
02:52 - modifiers and this is going to
02:55 - be set this equal
02:58 - to control
03:01 - and the reason we're setting this equal
03:03 - to control is because like I said before
03:06 - um in Eclipse it's command click to get
03:08 - to the function definition uh but uh
03:10 - command click already has some
03:12 - functionality within sublim it's to make
03:14 - these uh multiple cursers uh so instead
03:17 - we're going to use control so now we
03:19 - only have two more to go uh this one is
03:23 - called press
03:25 - command and set that equal to drag under
03:29 - _
03:32 - select and then the last one here we
03:35 - actually set the command and the command
03:38 - that we want is go
03:42 - toore
03:44 - definition and let's save that and now
03:47 - I'm going to restart
03:49 - Sublime and go down here and open it
03:51 - back
03:53 - up and now let's see if those changes
03:56 - took
03:57 - effect um okay so that is not working uh
04:02 - let's see if we can find where we made a
04:06 - mistake let's make sure that we put this
04:09 - file in the right directory okay that's
04:12 - where the file needs to go and let's
04:15 - make sure that the files
04:16 - there okay so it looks like whenever I
04:20 - uh left the quotes off the first time it
04:23 - uh put in some spaces here so um uh this
04:27 - there shouldn't be any spaces here
04:28 - between these parentheses
04:30 - um so let's try to move that file and I
04:34 - think I still have this saved on my
04:35 - clipboard so now we'll put this in
04:38 - quotes actually need to take these
04:41 - quotes out here back that okay so that
04:44 - should be good and let's check that okay
04:48 - that should be good let me clear the
04:50 - screen
04:53 - and don't save that okay now I'm going
04:56 - to restart Sublime Text
04:58 - again and pull it back up and now let's
05:02 - see if those changes took effect okay so
05:05 - that works now if we hold in control and
05:07 - click on any of these uh functions or
05:10 - methods uh you can see that it takes us
05:13 - directly to the definition um so that's
05:16 - extremely nice especially in uh whenever
05:19 - you have bigger projects with uh tons of
05:21 - files uh instead of digging through to
05:24 - find those definitions it's really nice
05:26 - just to be able to uh uh click on those
05:28 - from your imported modules and it have
05:31 - it take you directly to the code um so
05:34 - yeah hopefully this tip was useful for
05:36 - you guys uh you know if you have any
05:37 - questions feel free to ask in the
05:39 - comment section and be sure sure to
