00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in this
00:02 - video we're gonna take a look at some
00:03 - keyboard shortcuts from within the
00:05 - terminal that are extremely helpful once
00:08 - you get them memorized so let me pull up
00:10 - a longer command here so that we have
00:11 - something to work with so within the
00:14 - terminal if you just use your arrow keys
00:15 - to move around then you can only go one
00:17 - character at a time so the first
00:19 - shortcut is ctrl a if you hit control a
00:23 - you can see that the cursor jumped here
00:26 - to the beginning of the line so you can
00:28 - think of a as the beginning of the
00:30 - alphabet and so it goes to the beginning
00:33 - of the line the next shortcut is ctrl E
00:36 - and you can think of that as the end for
00:39 - end and that goes to the end of the OP
00:41 - end the line so ctrl a goes to the
00:44 - beginning ctrl ego's to the end now if
00:47 - we want to go in between that we can
00:49 - hold in the option key on the Mac and
00:52 - then use the arrows to go one word at
00:54 - the time so you can see I'm jumping by
00:56 - words here and then the right arrow goes
00:58 - one word to the right also if you're
01:01 - holding in the option key then you can
01:04 - then you see that the mouse here turns
01:06 - into this little bullseye here and
01:09 - anywhere that you click you go directly
01:11 - to that point so that's holding in the
01:14 - option key and then clicking anywhere
01:16 - within your command to go to that point
01:17 - so those are a few shortcuts for
01:20 - navigation now let's look at a few
01:22 - shortcuts for actually altering the
01:24 - commands so if you hit ctrl you then
01:28 - it's going to delete everything and the
01:32 - command before your cursor so for
01:34 - example if I hit ctrl you right here and
01:36 - it's going to delete everything before
01:38 - this type word right here so I'll hit
01:41 - control U and you can see that it took
01:43 - out everything before the cursor and now
01:46 - if I bring that back now this time I'm
01:51 - going to delete everything after the
01:52 - cursor so if I'm here at the same
01:54 - location this time if I hit ctrl K then
01:59 - it deletes everything after the cursor
02:01 - so I hit ctrl K it's going to delete
02:03 - everything after this type word here so
02:07 - ctrl K and you can see that deleted
02:09 - everything after the cursor and that
02:12 - command
02:13 - another nice command to know is the tab
02:16 - key and a lot of people already know
02:18 - this one but if you don't then you use
02:20 - it all the time it will autocomplete so
02:23 - say for example if I'm typing in CD and
02:25 - I know that I want to go to my projects
02:27 - folder all I have to do is type in the
02:30 - start of the word and if there's nothing
02:32 - else that matches that other than
02:33 - projects that can hit tab and you can
02:36 - see that it automatically completes that
02:38 - so if I want to go to demos I can hit D
02:40 - hit tab and then if I want to go to
02:43 - terminal so you can see it went all the
02:46 - way to terminal but then it kind of made
02:48 - a noise and it means that it can't
02:50 - autocomplete it all the way that's
02:51 - because with in here I have terminal
02:54 - demo and I also have underscore
02:57 - shortcuts so after you kind of give it a
03:02 - direction to go so say I want to go to
03:03 - shortcuts I'll type in the underscore
03:05 - then I'll hit tap again and it'll know
03:07 - how to complete the rest of that command
03:08 - so that's Auto completion using the tab
03:11 - key but you can also do Auto completion
03:16 - by dragging and dropping folders so for
03:19 - example let me move over my terminal
03:22 - window here so that you we can see my
03:24 - desktop say I want to change directory
03:28 - into this videos folder here well
03:31 - instead of typing in CD users kori
03:35 - desktop videos and things like you know
03:39 - all of that I can just type in CD back
03:41 - and grab this folder drag it to my
03:44 - terminal and drop it in and it'll fill
03:46 - in that path for me and if I hit enter
03:48 - then you can see now I'm in the videos
03:51 - directory so some other useful shortcuts
03:55 - here that you'll use all the time are
03:57 - the up arrows and the down arrows if you
03:58 - hit up it'll scroll through your
04:01 - previous commands and if you hit down it
04:04 - will go back through those commands all
04:06 - the way until you get to your new blank
04:09 - command now if you want to rerun a
04:12 - command that you've previously run and
04:14 - it's not immediately showing up whenever
04:16 - you try to scroll back through using
04:19 - your up arrow then you can type in the
04:22 - exclamation point and then some
04:25 - characters here so if I wanted to read
04:27 - the last fine command that I ran into
04:29 - terminal that I can type exclamation
04:31 - point find it doesn't even have to be
04:33 - find it can be
04:34 - fi and what that's going to do is the
04:37 - terminal is going to go back through
04:39 - your history and rerun the very first
04:41 - command that it sees that starts with Fi
04:44 - so if I run that then you can see that
04:47 - it ran this command here now if I hit
04:49 - the up arrow then you can see that the
04:52 - last command that it ran was this fine
04:55 - command that I ran a long time ago now
04:58 - you can also do this if you type in
04:59 - history then it's going to show you the
05:02 - history of all your commands and you can
05:05 - do the same thing with this history now
05:07 - you can either copy and paste these but
05:10 - say I wanted to rerun this find command
05:13 - again and I found this here at I want to
05:16 - run the one at 5:27 so instead of
05:20 - copying pasting or retyping the whole
05:23 - thing out I can just type in exclamation
05:25 - point
05:26 - 5:27 and I'll rerun the command in your
05:29 - history that is line 527 which was that
05:33 - fine command and you can see that it ran
05:35 - that there now if you want to
05:37 - interactively search for a previous
05:39 - command then you can hit ctrl R and you
05:41 - can see that's going to bring up this
05:43 - prompt here reverse search and so then
05:46 - you could just start typing and you can
05:48 - see if I highlight this here this is
05:50 - what I've typed in so far and it will go
05:52 - back and search your commands and will
05:56 - tell you which one it's going to run
05:58 - based off of the search that you've
06:00 - typed in so far so say that's the one I
06:02 - want I could just hit enter and they'll
06:04 - run that command for me and the last two
06:06 - shortcuts that I want to show you are
06:08 - two that you've been seeing me do
06:10 - throughout the whole video and that has
06:12 - to do with clearing the screen so say
06:15 - that I want to clear the screen right
06:17 - now I can hit control L and that'll
06:21 - clear the screen but what that doesn't
06:23 - do is clear the scroll back and what I
06:25 - mean by that is if I scroll up you can
06:28 - see that I can still scroll back aways
06:30 - here and if you don't like that then on
06:33 - the Mac you can hit the command key
06:36 - command K and it'll clear the scroll
06:38 - back so I just did that and now
06:40 - trying to scroll up and I can't because
06:42 - there's nothing there now if I hit ctrl
06:45 - L a few times which clears the screen
06:47 - but it doesn't clear the scroll back
06:49 - then you can see that all those control
06:51 - ELLs did was add a bunch of blank lines
06:54 - in to clear the screen out so those are
06:57 - a few keyboard shortcuts that I use
07:00 - within the terminal on a daily basis
07:01 - hopefully you guys found those useful if
