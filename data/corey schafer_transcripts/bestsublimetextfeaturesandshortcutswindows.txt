00:00 - hey there how's it goin everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be going over
00:02 - my favorite features and shortcuts in
00:04 - sublime text so sublime text is the
00:06 - editor that I use in most of my videos
00:08 - and I get tons of questions about how
00:10 - I'm doing certain things or what
00:11 - features I'm using so we'll cover my
00:13 - favorites here now learning how to use
00:15 - the features and shortcuts of the editor
00:17 - that you're using can definitely help
00:19 - you be more productive and get things
00:21 - done more quickly now this video will be
00:23 - for sublime text on the Windows
00:25 - operating system now if you're on a Mac
00:27 - then I do have a video for that as well
00:29 - so I'll put a link to that in the
00:30 - description section below I was gonna
00:32 - try to do this as one single video but
00:34 - the shortcuts are so different for each
00:36 - operating system that it was best just
00:37 - to split those into separate videos okay
00:40 - so the features that we're going to go
00:41 - over in this video will be features that
00:43 - will be available on the default
00:44 - installation of sublime text so you
00:46 - won't need any of the packages that I
00:48 - have installed with my installation but
00:51 - if you are curious about what packages
00:52 - and setup I'm using then I do have a
00:54 - separate video on that as well so I'll
00:56 - also put a link to that in the
00:58 - description section below also so with
01:00 - that said let's go ahead and get started
01:01 - so first of all the feature that I use
01:04 - the most and the one that I get asked
01:05 - about the most is the multi cursor
01:07 - functionality so I use this in a lot of
01:10 - my videos to speed up certain things but
01:12 - I use it all the time and my daily
01:13 - coding as well so this is also what will
01:16 - spend the most time one because there
01:18 - are a lot of different ways to use this
01:20 - so for people who don't know what this
01:22 - is it's a way to have multiple cursors
01:24 - at once now at first that might not
01:26 - sound useful but let's look at some
01:28 - examples and see why this is so awesome
01:30 - so I have a blank HTML file open here so
01:33 - let's say that we wanted to write some
01:34 - sample HTML code to put into a project
01:36 - so for example we're just going to
01:38 - create an unordered list with ten
01:40 - different items so I'm gonna create an
01:42 - unread list by hitting ul and then
01:44 - hitting tab and now we want ten list
01:46 - items and let's say that within those
01:48 - list items we wanted each one to be an
01:50 - h1 tag so we could just create one list
01:53 - item and then copy and paste that 10
01:55 - times or we can use multiple cursors to
01:58 - just type them all at once so to do this
02:01 - I'm gonna hit enter and make 10 blank
02:03 - lines here so we already have one line
02:05 - so I'll make nine more 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 ok
02:09 - so now we have 10 blank lines and now
02:11 - I'll create a new cursor on each
02:13 - by clicking on the first line here and
02:16 - I'm just going to make sure that that's
02:18 - untapped and now I'm going to hold down
02:20 - control and just click on each spot that
02:23 - I want another cursor so I'm holding
02:25 - down control and just clicking on these
02:28 - other lines and you can see that it's
02:29 - creating multiple cursors here and once
02:31 - we have those cursors in place that we
02:33 - could just start typing and it will type
02:35 - that content in all of those cursor
02:37 - locations so if I type out a list item
02:39 - so li and then hit tab creates the list
02:42 - item and now I can create an h1 tag by
02:45 - hitting h1 and pressing tab and that
02:47 - completes that and now I can just fill
02:49 - this in with some dummy text so I'll
02:50 - just put tests there okay so now you can
02:52 - see that we have ten list items fully
02:54 - complete so we can see that it just
02:56 - typed out multiple lines for us at once
02:59 - so using that ctrl-click is one way to
03:02 - get multiple cursors now another use
03:04 - case for this would be if we wanted to
03:06 - edit something in multiple places so for
03:08 - example let's say that we wanted to
03:10 - change all of the h1 tags in this list
03:12 - to be h2 tags now you might be thinking
03:15 - that you can just do a standard fine and
03:17 - replace all and in this example you
03:19 - could but a shortcut for this if I just
03:21 - select the first h1 here if I have my
03:25 - cursor here within the first h1 and then
03:27 - hand hit alt f3 then you can see that
03:31 - that highlights all of our h1 tags for
03:33 - editing so now we can just simply change
03:35 - those to h2 and save that so that
03:38 - changes all of the instances of the h1
03:41 - tags but in a larger document you might
03:43 - have some other h1 tags outside of this
03:45 - list that you don't want to change
03:47 - so simply highlighting and changing all
03:49 - of them might not be exactly what you
03:51 - want so let's change these back to h1 so
03:55 - I'm just going to undo that change so
03:57 - now let's look at an example we're going
03:58 - to want to be a little more selective so
04:01 - let's say that we just want to change
04:02 - certain h1 tags so let's change the last
04:05 - 5 h1 tags to be h2 tags now one way that
04:09 - we could do this would be by clicking
04:11 - where we want to start so that would be
04:13 - right here and then just holding down
04:15 - ctrl and double clicking all of these
04:18 - instances that we want to change but
04:20 - going through and clicking like that
04:21 - might take a while and there's actually
04:23 - a shortcut that we can use that will
04:24 - highlight the next match
04:26 - for us so if I just click the first one
04:28 - here now our cursor is within that h1
04:31 - tag and now let's just hit control D and
04:34 - then keep hitting ctrl D and it'll
04:37 - highlight the next h1 so whatever you
04:40 - have highlighted hitting control D will
04:42 - highlight that next match for you so
04:44 - that you can make multiple changes at
04:45 - once
04:46 - so now we went all the way to the bottom
04:48 - here if I was to hit control D again
04:50 - then it would cycle back up to the top
04:52 - but we don't want to do that so now I'm
04:54 - just going to change those last five to
04:57 - h2 tags so we can see that we can use
04:59 - those multiple cursors to only change
05:01 - those where we want okay now another
05:03 - awesome thing that we can do with
05:05 - multiple cursors is to copy and paste
05:07 - multiple things at once so what do I
05:09 - mean by that well for example I have a
05:11 - snippets file open here and let me open
05:14 - this up it's got a few different lines
05:15 - and we can see that we have ten items
05:17 - here on different lists so let's say
05:19 - that we want these items to be the text
05:21 - that is inside of our HTML list items so
05:24 - how could we do this well some people
05:26 - might just copy and paste one item at a
05:29 - time back and forth but that would take
05:31 - a really long time especially if our
05:32 - list was a lot larger so instead let's
05:35 - just highlight all of these at once and
05:38 - then copy those and paste them so I'm
05:40 - going to do a ctrl click at the end of
05:43 - each of these lines which we saw before
05:44 - will create a cursor at the end of each
05:47 - of these lines so I'm just going through
05:48 - and control clicking down on each of
05:51 - these items and now I'm going to
05:52 - highlight all of this by holding in
05:54 - control shift and then hitting my left
05:57 - arrow and I'm just going to do that
05:59 - multiple times until I get back to the
06:01 - beginning of the line and now once we
06:04 - have everything highlighted let's copy
06:06 - this by hitting ctrl C and now going
06:09 - back to our HTML and now back in our
06:11 - list let's highlight the 10 locations
06:13 - that we want to change and I'll do that
06:15 - just by clicking on the first test here
06:18 - and then pressing ctrl D like we did
06:21 - before and just highlight all of these
06:23 - so I will just highlight down all the
06:25 - way to the bottom and now that we have
06:26 - all 10 of these highlighted then we can
06:29 - simply paste in what we copied by
06:30 - pressing control V so you can see that
06:33 - it pastes in all of that information
06:35 - into those 10 locations so that pays our
06:38 - 10 copied items into
06:40 - ten different locations now when you
06:42 - copy and paste multiple multiple items
06:44 - like this you have to have the same
06:46 - number of cursors that you used to copy
06:48 - in order to paste so if you don't then
06:52 - it will paste in all of those items and
06:54 - that can be pretty ugly so what I mean
06:56 - by that let me just show you what I mean
06:58 - so I'll come down here to the bottom and
07:00 - create a few blank lines here now I'm
07:02 - going to just create two cursors now
07:04 - remember we have 10 items copied but
07:07 - only two cursors here so now if I paste
07:10 - this in then it's just going to paste
07:12 - all 10 of those items on those two
07:15 - cursors so be on the lookout for that
07:18 - maybe that's what you want but maybe
07:20 - it's not so if you have 10 cursors then
07:23 - it's just gonna paste all 10 of those
07:25 - items one time just like it did up here
07:27 - in our list so now I will remove that
07:30 - and go back to our list here so this
07:32 - multi cursor copy and paste trick has
07:35 - saved me a ton of time more times than I
07:36 - can count so it's pretty awesome now
07:39 - another thing that I use this for is to
07:41 - split things out and make them more
07:43 - readable so for example let me go back
07:45 - to my snippets file here if I scroll
07:47 - down here to the bottom so this is a
07:49 - real example of what my path environment
07:51 - variable looks like on my Mac and Linux
07:53 - machines now if you don't know what this
07:55 - is then don't worry about it it's just
07:57 - basically a list of directories on your
07:59 - machine where your terminal looks for
08:01 - commands now all of these directories
08:03 - are separated by colons so that's not
08:06 - really readable right now especially if
08:08 - you have a lot more directories how to
08:10 - do it than this so let's say that I
08:11 - wanted to split these up onto different
08:13 - lines so that I could read this a little
08:15 - better so to do this I can just simply
08:17 - highlight the first colon here and now
08:20 - I'm just going to press control D until
08:22 - I highlight all the way up until the
08:24 - last colon and now I'm just going to
08:26 - simply hit enter and we can see that it
08:28 - replaced all of those colons with a new
08:30 - line and split all of these directories
08:32 - up onto their own lines then and that
08:34 - makes it a lot more readable ok so now
08:37 - that we saw a few examples of using this
08:39 - in HTML let's look at a quick example of
08:42 - how you might use this and Python so
08:44 - we'll just do a quick overview of a few
08:46 - tricks that we just learned so I have a
08:48 - Python script opened up here so let me
08:50 - switch to that so this script here is
08:53 - from my abs
08:54 - Oriented video where we started learning
08:55 - about classes and manually setting
08:58 - attributes now this is actually a
09:00 - mistake that I made in that video so if
09:02 - you look here then I created my employee
09:05 - one object and an employee two object
09:07 - and then I'm manually setting attributes
09:10 - on both of those here now for the second
09:13 - group of attributes here I accidentally
09:15 - set them on employee one again so all of
09:17 - these actually should be employee two
09:20 - here so we could go through and manually
09:22 - fix those or we can simply use multi
09:24 - cursors to just click on employee one
09:27 - here at the top then press control D
09:30 - until we highlight the four that we want
09:32 - to change now remember we don't want to
09:33 - change all of the employee ones just the
09:35 - ones in the second group so that's why
09:37 - control D is so useful once we have all
09:39 - those highlighted then we can just go to
09:41 - the end here delete that one make that a
09:44 - to save it and we're done okay and now
09:46 - let's say that our boss comes in and
09:48 - tells us that this EMP one variable name
09:51 - isn't descriptive enough so we need to
09:53 - change that to something more
09:55 - descriptive so we want to change EMP one
09:58 - and EMP to to be employee one and
10:01 - employee two and in this case since we
10:03 - want to change them all then we can
10:05 - simply highlight one of these here so
10:08 - I'll just highlight the top one and then
10:10 - I will press alt and then f3 to
10:14 - highlight all of those EMP variable
10:17 - names and to change all of them all at
10:19 - once I will just go to where we want to
10:21 - make the addition and type that in and
10:24 - you can see it's typing at all of those
10:25 - cursor locations and changing them all
10:27 - and then we can save that so now we can
10:29 - see that all of those were changed okay
10:31 - so that is a look at the multi cursor
10:33 - functionality in sublime text
10:35 - now that is by far my favorite feature
10:37 - in sublime now this is also becoming
10:39 - more popular and other editors as well
10:41 - so if you're not using sublime text then
10:43 - check if the editor that you are using
10:45 - has multi cursor functionality and start
10:48 - using it if you can because it'll save
10:49 - you a ton of time okay so now let's look
10:52 - at some more features and shortcuts that
10:54 - I use a lot within sublime so one
10:56 - feature that I use all the time is
10:58 - switching between tabs and creating
11:00 - multiple panes so first of all we can
11:03 - see that we already have multiple tabs
11:04 - open here with multiple files open so
11:07 - to switch through these with a keyboard
11:09 - shortcut we can use ctrl tab and ctrl
11:12 - tab will move to the next tab and ctrl
11:15 - shift tab will move to the previous tab
11:18 - now if we want to close a tab then we
11:22 - can hit ctrl W and we can see that that
11:25 - club that that tab that we're on closed
11:27 - down now if we accidentally closed the
11:29 - tab and we want to reopen a closed tab
11:31 - then we can hit control shift T and it
11:36 - will reopen the tab that we closed now
11:38 - if any of you are Google Chrome users
11:39 - then that should be familiar to you
11:41 - because it's the same keyboard shortcuts
11:43 - for Chrome tabs also and I'm glad that
11:45 - sublime uses those familiar shortcuts ok
11:48 - so now that we've looked at tabs now
11:50 - let's look at how to set up multiple
11:52 - panels now this is something that I also
11:54 - use a lot especially when I'm doing
11:56 - something like web development where I
11:58 - want to be able to see the HTML and CSS
12:00 - at the same time or maybe you know maybe
12:03 - look at a Django or flask view and a
12:06 - template at the same time or anything
12:08 - like that so there are a lot of
12:10 - different panel layouts that we can use
12:11 - so if we hit alt shift and 2 then we can
12:15 - see that it creates and opens two panels
12:18 - side by side and a column layout and we
12:20 - can drag any tab that we want into this
12:23 - panel so that we can see both of these
12:25 - at once so now I can see the HTML file
12:29 - here along with the snippets file here
12:31 - now if we hit alt shift and 3 then it'll
12:35 - open up 3 panels in a column layout and
12:38 - then we can look at three files at once
12:40 - now with the word wrap here and the text
12:42 - so large it's getting all scrunched
12:44 - together but usually I have two text a
12:46 - lot smaller than this so this three
12:48 - column layout is extremely useful if
12:49 - you're working on something like
12:50 - front-end code and you want to see your
12:52 - HTML Javascript and CSS all at the same
12:56 - time ok now we can also hit alt shift
12:59 - and 4 and that will open up four columns
13:02 - now I feel like this starts to get a
13:04 - little crowded and a little less
13:05 - practical unless you have a really big
13:07 - monitor but some people find it useful
13:09 - now we can also hit alt shift and five
13:12 - and it will split our four panels into a
13:16 - grid so instead of that four column
13:18 - layout now we have two columns and two
13:21 - rose now I feel like this would be a
13:23 - little more practical on a large monitor
13:26 - but still I don't really use the four
13:27 - panels very often I use the two panels a
13:30 - lot and the three panels a little bit
13:32 - also now we can also hit alt shift eight
13:36 - and that'll just open up two rows if you
13:38 - prefer them stacked one on top of
13:41 - another rather than side by side and to
13:43 - get back to our single window then we
13:45 - can simply just hit alt shift and one
13:47 - and it'll take us back to that single
13:48 - window okay so another nice quick
13:51 - shortcut that I like in sublime text is
13:53 - being able to move lines around using
13:55 - ctrl shift and then the up and down
13:58 - arrows so let me show you this by going
14:00 - back to our sample HTML here so let's
14:03 - say that we wanted to move a few of
14:04 - these items around so instead of copying
14:07 - and pasting them all around we can
14:09 - simply click on the line that we want to
14:11 - move and then hold in ctrl shift and
14:14 - then use the up and down arrows to move
14:17 - this around where we want so we can see
14:19 - I'm moving it up to the top of the list
14:21 - now and if I hit the down there it moves
14:23 - it to the bottom so if we wanted to
14:25 - reverse this whole list then I could
14:27 - simply click on the first item and hold
14:29 - ctrl shift use the arrows to move it
14:32 - down and then just do this for every
14:34 - item in the list and pretty soon we will
14:38 - have the whole thing reversed and then
14:43 - switch the five and six and that
14:44 - reversed our list so that would have
14:46 - taken a lot longer if we were to copy
14:48 - and paste everything okay so the rest of
14:50 - these features that we're going to look
14:51 - at are just going to be real quick
14:53 - keyboard shortcuts so first of all in my
14:56 - videos I'll often run a Python code
14:58 - using sublime text so sublime has some
15:01 - built in build systems where it will try
15:03 - to run the code of whatever language
15:05 - you're using so let me open up my
15:07 - sandbox Python file here and I will
15:11 - close that and we can see that we have a
15:14 - print statement here at the bottom of
15:15 - the file so the keyboard shortcut for
15:17 - running code in sublime text is control
15:20 - B so if I press control B then we can
15:23 - see that it runs that code and prints
15:24 - out that first employees email now by
15:26 - default sublime will try to guess how
15:28 - you want to run certain code but if
15:30 - you're using different versions of
15:32 - Python or anything like that then I have
15:34 - a separate video
15:34 - on sublime build systems showing how you
15:37 - can set those up exactly how you want
15:39 - okay so another thing that I do a lot
15:41 - when I've opened a directory is to get
15:44 - some more screen space and collapse the
15:47 - sidebar so first of all let me close
15:49 - this bottom panel here where we ran our
15:51 - code and to do that we just press escape
15:53 - and now I want to collapse this sidebar
15:56 - to get more screen space so to collapse
15:58 - that I can just hold down ctrl and then
16:01 - press K and then B and you want to hold
16:04 - down control the whole time when you're
16:06 - pressing both of those buttons so again
16:07 - I'm gonna hold down control and open
16:09 - this sidebar again and then press K and
16:13 - then B while holding down control and it
16:15 - opens that back up so that's a nice
16:17 - quick keyboard shortcut to collapse that
16:20 - and pull it back up when you want it
16:21 - okay so something else that I use a lot
16:23 - is the keyboard shortcut for commenting
16:25 - code and to do that you can use control
16:27 - forward slash and this works for
16:29 - multiple languages as well so over here
16:32 - in my HTML if I want to comment out
16:35 - these last five items here then I can
16:37 - just highlight those then press control
16:39 - Ford slash and we can see that it
16:41 - comments out those last five items there
16:44 - and if I want to do this in Python then
16:47 - I can come in and click on a line and
16:49 - press control Ford slash and it will
16:51 - comment out one line or I can highlight
16:53 - multiple lines press control Ford slash
16:56 - and it comments out all of those lines
16:58 - at once so we can see that the syntax
17:00 - for comments and HTML and Python both
17:03 - have different ways of commenting their
17:05 - code and sublime adds those in correctly
17:08 - automatically for each language so
17:10 - that's really useful okay so lastly
17:12 - another one of my favorite features with
17:14 - sublime is the command palette now you
17:17 - can open the command palette by pressing
17:19 - ctrl shift P and that will open up the
17:23 - command palette now the command palette
17:25 - allows you to do a few different things
17:27 - like setting different syntaxes and
17:30 - things like that but the best thing that
17:32 - you can do is install new packages and
17:34 - packages allow you to add functionality
17:36 - that currently isn't in sublime so for
17:39 - example you may have noticed that my
17:40 - HTML has been Auto formatting throughout
17:44 - the video and that is an HTML package
17:47 - that
17:48 - or match your code for you and you can
17:49 - also install packages that make visual
17:51 - changes as well
17:52 - so it gives you different color schemes
17:54 - and different themes and things like
17:56 - that also now I've already done a video
17:58 - on the packages and other preferences
18:00 - that I have set in my sublime text so I
18:02 - won't go into details in this video but
18:05 - I will put a link to that video in the
18:06 - description section below if anyone is
18:08 - interested okay so I think that is gonna
18:10 - do it for this video
18:11 - hopefully you found this helpful and
18:13 - learn some new things about sublime text
18:14 - I get a lot of comments asking about
18:17 - these features so hopefully this cleared
18:19 - up any questions that anyone would have
18:21 - now if you have any favorite features or
18:23 - shortcuts that I didn't mention in this
18:24 - video then feel free to leave a comment
18:27 - and let me know about it so if you enjoy
