00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody so I
00:02 - went to record some videos for you all
00:03 - the other day and unfortunately when I
00:06 - went to turn on my recording machine it
00:08 - wouldn't start up which isn't super
00:09 - surprising because I've had that machine
00:11 - for over 10 years now and it finally
00:13 - stopped working on me so I did have to
00:15 - go out and buy a new one and that is the
00:17 - one that I'm recording on now and this
00:20 - machine is pretty much in the exact same
00:22 - state that it was when I took it out of
00:24 - the box so I haven't changed any
00:26 - settings or set up any of my development
00:28 - tools and I haven't installed any
00:31 - applications on this machine other than
00:33 - Camtasia and that's what I'm using for
00:35 - my screen recordings so this is
00:38 - completely brand new right now without
00:39 - any customizations so in this video what
00:42 - I wanted to do was show you how I go
00:44 - about setting up a new development
00:46 - machine for myself uh completely from
00:48 - scratch and I also get a lot of comments
00:51 - and emails asking you know what software
00:53 - I'm using and how I have all of my
00:55 - settings configured so hopefully after
00:57 - this video uh you'll be able to find out
00:59 - exactly where I have all these things
01:01 - saved and how I go about getting
01:03 - everything installed so that you can
01:05 - customize those to how you want to use
01:08 - them and when it comes to setting all
01:09 - this stuff up I actually don't like
01:11 - needing to remember everything off the
01:13 - top of my head so I have all of these
01:16 - things saved in automated scripts that I
01:18 - pull down from GitHub to set up my
01:20 - machine exactly how I like it and that
01:23 - way it's nice and predictable every time
01:26 - I set up a new machine uh and it does
01:28 - the same thing every single time now
01:30 - some of you may have clicked on this
01:31 - video thinking that I was going to show
01:33 - how to migrate one machine over to
01:35 - another uh using a backup or time
01:38 - machine for the Mac or something like
01:40 - that but whenever I do this I like to
01:42 - have fresh insulations of everything
01:44 - that's just a personal preference of
01:45 - mine uh when I get a new development
01:47 - machine I don't like migrating all my
01:50 - old backups over from one machine to
01:52 - another uh because over time our
01:54 - machines just get so cluttered and they
01:56 - have a lot of leftover software and
01:58 - things that are never deleted so I
02:00 - personally like to start freshh from
02:02 - scratch and that's pretty easy for me
02:04 - because my files and photos are saved in
02:07 - sync uh on a lot of cloud services so I
02:10 - don't really keep a lot of my stuff on a
02:12 - local machine that needs to be
02:13 - transferred over but for things that I
02:15 - do want to keep uh I just save those
02:18 - directly to a thumb drive and transfer
02:20 - them over that way and then that way all
02:22 - the applications and everything else are
02:24 - installed from scratch but with that
02:26 - said let's go ahead and get started and
02:27 - I'll show you exactly how I do this so
02:30 - first I'm going to need to actually grab
02:32 - those dot files that I use that have all
02:33 - those automated scripts and I have those
02:36 - set up on GitHub now I don't have Google
02:38 - Chrome installed because I haven't
02:40 - installed anything on here yet so I'm
02:42 - just going to use uh Safari and I'll
02:45 - just type in uh Cory shaer dot files it
02:48 - should take me there and then we'll kind
02:51 - of go over these so first let me go
02:53 - ahead and make the text a little bit
02:55 - larger so that everybody can see I'll
02:58 - maximize the window here here a little
03:00 - bit and now let's scroll down and go
03:04 - over these dot files now I have done a
03:06 - video of these dot files before uh but
03:09 - that was a long time ago I think that
03:10 - was about five or six years ago now and
03:13 - a lot of these have changed actually I
03:14 - think this is basically a complete
03:16 - rewrite uh of what I had in that last
03:19 - video and I also uh rewrote my DOT files
03:23 - to have a readme file here um that walks
03:26 - through the steps that I'm going to take
03:27 - in this video to set up a new machine
03:30 - and actually you can see here in the
03:31 - documentation that after I release this
03:33 - video I'm actually going to put it
03:35 - within the readme file here uh as a
03:37 - reference um now one of the most
03:39 - important things I put right here at the
03:41 - top uh for important note before
03:44 - installation so the thing about these
03:46 - dot files is that these are uh highly
03:49 - personalized to my own preferences and
03:51 - the way that I do things and it will
03:53 - actually modify your system so whenever
03:56 - I run these scripts uh it moves files
03:58 - around it changes settings on the
04:00 - machine um it changes you know my
04:02 - desktop icon to the way that I like it
04:05 - for these videos and things like that um
04:07 - a lot of these changes are irreversible
04:10 - um if you don't know exactly what the
04:12 - script is doing so if you want a
04:15 - development environment like mine what I
04:17 - suggest is just forking a repository
04:20 - like this and that's exactly how I got
04:21 - started too I forked a repository of
04:24 - somebody's settings that I liked made my
04:26 - own changes and then over time it kind
04:28 - of became my own thing so just be aware
04:30 - of that that it's important to know what
04:33 - this script actually does before you run
04:34 - it on your own machine uh because it is
04:36 - going to make some changes um so with
04:39 - that said why don't we go ahead and take
04:41 - a look at some of these scripts here to
04:43 - see exactly what this is going to do now
04:45 - I'm not going to go over every single
04:47 - detail as to what these installation
04:49 - scripts do uh but let's just get a broad
04:52 - overview of what's going on here um so
04:54 - the main entry point uh to these
04:57 - installations is in this install. sh
05:00 - script so if we look at this then we can
05:03 - see that one of the first things that it
05:05 - does is it finds our home directory uh
05:08 - with this do files directory which is
05:10 - where we're going to clone the
05:12 - repository and here is where it copies
05:15 - over all of the dot files that we
05:16 - currently have which are uh these files
05:19 - over here bash profile bash prompt uh my
05:22 - zshell prompts and files and
05:24 - configurations things like that now what
05:27 - those dot files do is they set up my
05:30 - terminal in a specific way uh for
05:32 - example if I look at this um zshell file
05:35 - uh what this does is it loads other dot
05:38 - files here so it loads up my prompt it
05:41 - loads up my aliases so if I look at my
05:43 - prompt this is just a custom prompt here
05:46 - um because if I open up my terminal now
05:49 - uh for those of you who are used to
05:51 - seeing my videos before uh you probably
05:53 - know that I have this customized to
05:55 - where um you know I has the my own
05:58 - colors setup and also um whenever I'm in
06:02 - a get repository it'll tell me the
06:03 - branch that I'm in uh within this prompt
06:05 - and everything here um so that's what
06:08 - this prompt here does so I actually have
06:10 - these setup both for bash and for Zell
06:14 - um so for example if I go to my bash
06:17 - prompts we can see that's basically the
06:18 - same thing uh both my bash and my zshell
06:22 - prompts are both uh using this shared
06:25 - prompt here uh which is code that works
06:27 - on both of them so promp git that's what
06:30 - shows the git branch that I'm on um I
06:33 - have this prompt V andv here which shows
06:36 - us if we are within a python virtual
06:38 - environment and then it just sets up the
06:40 - colors that I use and things like that
06:42 - so if I go back here to the installation
06:45 - script then the next thing that it does
06:48 - is it runs my uh Mac OS specific scripts
06:51 - now this is all kind of uh Mac specific
06:54 - since I work mainly on Macs a lot of
06:57 - this will work on Linux as well um but
06:59 - within Mac here you can see that we're
07:02 - just installing some command line tools
07:04 - I set up a couple of different things
07:06 - for the mouse uh the scroll Direction
07:08 - and things like that and then I'm
07:10 - putting my uh desktop icon to be uh the
07:13 - one that you know have probably seen in
07:15 - these videos before so just a very short
07:18 - Mac script here um one of the main
07:21 - things is within this brew. sh script
07:26 - and that's where it runs all of my home
07:28 - brew commands so if we look at that then
07:31 - this is where a lot of my applications
07:33 - get installed here so first I'm
07:36 - installing Homebrew and if uh you don't
07:38 - know what Homebrew is I actually have a
07:40 - separate video on that it's basically
07:42 - just a package manager for Max uh and
07:45 - also for Linux um and after that's
07:48 - installed then I come down here and I
07:50 - update it upgrade it just make sure that
07:52 - we're using all of the latest packages
07:55 - and then for the command line I'm
07:57 - installing python Bash
08:00 - zsh G tree pilent things like that um
08:04 - and then and I tried to comment this as
08:07 - much as I could so that uh you all could
08:10 - modify these if you want to modify these
08:12 - scripts um but right here we can see
08:14 - that I am modifying my system to change
08:17 - my shell to use the Homebrew version of
08:20 - zsh instead of uh the one that comes
08:24 - installed on the Mac and then I set up
08:26 - my git configurations here with my git
08:29 - uh username my git email and then what
08:33 - we do like I said I'm not going to go
08:34 - over every little bit here this is just
08:36 - setting up a virtual environment that I
08:38 - use for a lot of my tutorials now these
08:41 - applications here these are applications
08:44 - that I'm going to install with Homebrew
08:46 - cask and Cask is an actual application
08:49 - for my machine pro usually a guey
08:52 - application so here we can see that uh
08:54 - this installs Google Chrome Firefox uh
08:57 - Sublime Text Visual Studio uh Spotify
09:00 - Discord my Google Drive and things like
09:02 - that um then after that it installs some
09:06 - fonts that I like um and then I think
09:10 - that's basically it for that file so
09:12 - after that's done if we go back to the
09:14 - installation script we can see that it
09:16 - runs uh my VSS code settings and within
09:20 - here what it does is it installs some
09:23 - different extensions that I use for vs
09:25 - code um and anytime that I enjoy a
09:29 - another extension or something like that
09:30 - if I really like it and want to transfer
09:32 - that to my normal workflow then I'll
09:34 - just add it here to these scripts um so
09:37 - after it installs those extensions then
09:40 - it moves a couple of things around on my
09:42 - machine uh we can see here that it moves
09:44 - over my custom settings my custom key
09:46 - bindings and things like that now I did
09:49 - put a couple of safeguards in place for
09:51 - certain things uh so what this is doing
09:53 - here is it's uh backing up my old
09:55 - setting file and my old key bindings
09:57 - into a backup file here here just in
10:00 - case something goes wrong uh then I'll
10:02 - have those backups uh but these backups
10:05 - it only keeps one iteration of these so
10:07 - I probably could have made this to where
10:09 - it is keeping timestamp versions of
10:11 - these backups or something like that but
10:13 - like I said this is just my personal
10:15 - preferences and it's been working for me
10:17 - so this is how I have things set up and
10:20 - lastly if we look at our installation
10:23 - script again we can see that it comes
10:24 - down here uh to Sublime Text and Sublime
10:28 - Text this is I have everything set up
10:30 - here um so the supply text one's a
10:33 - little bit different than vs code
10:35 - because it actually has to be opened up
10:38 - until some different folders and
10:41 - directories are created uh so that's why
10:44 - I'm kind of opening up Sublime here and
10:46 - then uh closing it a few times uh just
10:48 - to make sure that everything gets
10:50 - installed correctly and the way that
10:52 - Sublime Text installs its packages is
10:54 - you set this package control settings
10:56 - file um so what I'm doing is copying my
10:59 - own over into uh the one that gets
11:02 - installed through Homebrew and then I
11:04 - open up Sublime text automatically to
11:06 - install those packages um now in this
11:09 - settings directory this is actually part
11:11 - of my files repository here uh this is
11:15 - just a couple of different things that I
11:17 - use for settings so uh we can see here
11:20 - that uh for example these are my vs code
11:23 - settings here that get copied over um
11:25 - these are some of my Sublime Tech
11:28 - settings for
11:29 - my linter um my main Sublime Tech
11:32 - settings here um so all of these are
11:35 - things that just get um automatically
11:37 - moved to the correct locations whenever
11:39 - I run these scripts so now that we've
11:41 - seen uh a broad overview and again if
11:44 - you actually want to look at these uh I
11:46 - would highly recommend looking through
11:48 - uh the readme file here and diving in
11:51 - and taking a look at it yourself but now
11:53 - that we've looked at this got a briad
11:55 - overview of what's going on and know all
11:57 - the cavey Huts about running this code
11:59 - um let's go ahead and run it on this
12:00 - machine and see how it works so what I'm
12:02 - going to do here is I'm going to uh grab
12:05 - the URL to this repository and now I can
12:08 - actually close down my browser after I
12:11 - have that and now I'm going to open up
12:12 - terminal here we can see that we already
12:14 - have it open and normally when you open
12:16 - up terminal it should put you directly
12:19 - into your home folder so I'm in my uh
12:21 - corms home folder here if you're not
12:24 - then you can just hit CD and enter and
12:26 - that should take you to your home
12:27 - directory or you can use uh CD with the
12:30 - Tilda and that should take you to your
12:32 - home directory as well um so now that
12:34 - I'm in my home directory here if I do an
12:37 - LS we just have the normal things uh my
12:39 - desktop my documents things like that um
12:42 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
12:44 - get clone and then I'm going to paste in
12:47 - that files repository from GitHub so
12:50 - let's go ahead and run that now whenever
12:52 - I first run git on this machine uh we
12:55 - can see that it didn't actually run this
12:58 - so it says that no developer tools were
12:59 - found uh it's requesting to install now
13:03 - sometimes I've had this pop up for me
13:04 - before um it didn't pop up this time but
13:07 - we can see down here in the bottom right
13:10 - that if I click that then we do have a
13:12 - little uh popup here that says that we
13:14 - need to install git so I'm just going to
13:16 - go ahead and allow it to do that agree
13:18 - to the terms of service now most of
13:20 - these installations usually go fairly
13:22 - quickly um this one says 4 minutes right
13:25 - now it's probably not going to take four
13:27 - minutes it's probably just saying that
13:29 - and we'll update here in just a second
13:31 - but if any of these installations do
13:32 - take a little bit of time uh then what
13:34 - I'm going to do is just skip forward in
13:36 - the video a little bit until these
13:38 - installations are done um just so that
13:40 - you don't have to sit here and watch
13:42 - these installations uh install on my
13:44 - machine okay so now we can see that that
13:47 - software was installed um so now let's
13:50 - go back here to the terminal where we
13:52 - tried to run that get command before and
13:55 - now I'm going to run get clone on that
13:56 - do files repo again and this time we can
13:59 - see that it pulled those down uh
14:01 - correctly so now I'm going to CD into
14:05 - that do files directory and this is just
14:08 - what we've looked at before if I do an
14:10 - lsla we can see that here I have all my
14:13 - DOT files and we've already taken a
14:15 - broad overview of some of these files so
14:17 - we have um my install script here Mac OS
14:21 - and my settings module and things like
14:23 - that now it does look like I have my
14:26 - Sublime liner settings out here uh
14:28 - messed around a little bit with this
14:30 - before making this video um I also have
14:33 - those in there so that's probably just a
14:35 - mistake it probably won't be there by
14:37 - the time I release this video um I
14:39 - probably just accidentally committed
14:40 - that and didn't see it um but let's look
14:44 - at these files again and like I said
14:46 - this installation script here uh
14:49 - install.sh that's the main entry point
14:51 - into these installations so now I'll
14:53 - just go ahead and run that uh we can see
14:56 - that it is executable over here so if I
14:59 - just do an install.sh let's go ahead and
15:02 - run that and it'll go through the
15:03 - process of setting up my entire
15:05 - machine okay so we run that and it goes
15:08 - through and creates Sim links to all
15:09 - those dot files um now it's saying that
15:12 - the command line tools are already
15:13 - installed uh or else it would have tried
15:15 - to install those now a couple of these
15:18 - things it's going to ask for permissions
15:20 - like it wanted permission to uh set my
15:22 - desktop background there so I allowed
15:24 - that um now what it's trying to do is uh
15:27 - install Homebrew so uh some of these
15:30 - require pseudo access so I'll go ahead
15:32 - and put in my password here and this is
15:35 - just Homebrew telling us what it's going
15:36 - to install so I'll hit enter to accept
15:38 - that and now Homebrew is going to go
15:40 - through the installation of all the
15:42 - command line tools that I use and all of
15:44 - the applications like Google Chrome and
15:47 - things like that that I use okay so one
15:49 - of the first breaks that it comes to in
15:51 - this installation script is uh telling
15:53 - me that it's trying to change my default
15:55 - shell uh to The Homebrew zshell so I'll
15:58 - go ahead and put in my password uh to
16:00 - accept that
16:02 - and put in my password again and that
16:06 - was successful now it's asking me to set
16:09 - up my git configuration so I'll go ahead
16:11 - and put in my information for
16:15 - git and like I said before these are all
16:18 - things that you can uh forget I don't
16:20 - like remember or I don't like needing to
16:23 - remember all of this off the top of my
16:24 - head so having it ask all of this
16:27 - information right off the bat
16:29 - uh for a onetime install I just like
16:31 - getting it all out of the way okay so
16:33 - now it looks like it's done installing
16:35 - most of those applications and the fonts
16:37 - and things like that um now there are a
16:40 - couple of manual things to go through uh
16:42 - in this installation process uh for
16:44 - example and whenever there is a manual
16:47 - step I just have it uh Echo out to the
16:49 - terminal here to tell me exactly what to
16:50 - do so here I'm telling myself to import
16:54 - my terminal settings now these are
16:56 - different from my Comm command line
16:58 - prompt settings and my DOT files this is
17:00 - actually going to customize um my actual
17:04 - terminal application uh with a different
17:06 - background and transparency and things
17:08 - like that so I'm just telling myself
17:10 - here to go to terminal settings profiles
17:13 - import and to uh import that from here
17:17 - so let me go to terminal settings and
17:22 - profiles and this is based off of this
17:26 - uh Pro profile here now to import we you
17:29 - click down here in the bottom left go to
17:33 - import and let's see this is in my home
17:38 - folder do files settings and I just
17:43 - named this CMS terminal here so let me
17:47 - choose CMS and then click to have this
17:51 - be my default profile for my terminal so
17:55 - now I'll just close that down and it's
17:57 - actually not going to apply those
17:58 - changes to the terminal until uh we
18:01 - restart but we don't want to do that now
18:02 - because we're still in the middle of our
18:04 - installation script so I'll go ahead and
18:06 - press enter to continue now at this
18:08 - point of the script I have it tell me to
18:11 - sign into a few different applications
18:13 - here uh because again the whole point of
18:15 - this script is to be completely done
18:18 - with everything after the script is
18:19 - finished running so I don't want to have
18:22 - to go through and think oh I forgot to
18:24 - sign in Spotify I forgot to sign into
18:26 - Chrome so I just remind myself to it
18:28 - here manually um but I'm not going to do
18:30 - that here in this video because I don't
18:32 - want you all to have to uh watch me go
18:34 - through all that so where it says sign
18:36 - in to Chrome I sign in Chrome first
18:38 - because I use their password manager so
18:40 - that gives me access to all my other
18:41 - passwords um but I'm just going to press
18:44 - enter there skip signing in the Spotify
18:46 - skip signing in the Discord um now it's
18:49 - saying to open rectangle and give it the
18:51 - necessary permissions now that is the
18:53 - Windows manager that I use on a Mac so
18:56 - in order for that to um actually manage
18:59 - my windows I have to open it up for the
19:01 - first time here and give it access and
19:05 - then what we need to do here is open my
19:07 - system settings and actually give it
19:11 - access uh to be able to manage my
19:13 - windows so I'll go ahead and put in my
19:15 - password there and just use the uh
19:18 - recommended outof the-box behavior and
19:21 - now we have our settings here and this
19:24 - is actually another thing that I tell
19:25 - myself to do uh manually So within the
19:27 - script here after I have it uh give the
19:30 - necessary permissions I've already done
19:32 - that so I'll hit enter and now it says
19:34 - import your rectangle settings uh
19:37 - located in the settings rectangle
19:39 - config.js file so I'll just do that
19:42 - really quick import and again that was
19:46 - in my home folder files settings
19:50 - rectangle config.js
19:53 - and that should be set up how I like it
19:56 - now so now I'll go ahead and hit enter
19:58 - to continue and now it should continue
20:01 - on to uh the vs code stuff so this is
20:04 - installing my vs code
20:07 - applications okay so after it makes all
20:09 - of the changes that it needs to make to
20:11 - VSS code and gets that set up uh it's
20:13 - actually going to open my do files
20:15 - directory with nvs code and the reason I
20:18 - do this is because we can see here that
20:21 - I'm asking myself to log into certain
20:23 - extensions like co-pilot and things like
20:26 - that so again I'm not going to do that
20:29 - uh for this video it's also asking me to
20:31 - select some color themes um so one thing
20:34 - here let's open up these settings and
20:37 - whenever I open up the settings let me
20:39 - make the text a little bit larger so
20:41 - everybody can see um now you've probably
20:45 - seen uh this color scheme that I use in
20:48 - vs code in other videos uh but we can
20:51 - see that it installed all of those uh
20:53 - correctly and this is how I've had my vs
20:55 - code set up in other videos uh and and
20:58 - that installation script did all of that
21:00 - for me so again like I said this is
21:02 - normally where I would go in and go to
21:05 - GitHub co-pilot and log in uh to my
21:08 - extensions that I have access to and
21:10 - things like that but I'm going to skip
21:12 - that for this video and do that later
21:15 - even though that kind of defies the
21:17 - purpose of why I have these scripts to
21:19 - begin with now one thing I noticed
21:21 - whenever I was testing this script on
21:23 - another machine for this video um
21:25 - whenever I run the VSS code part of this
21:28 - script I saw some warnings that popped
21:30 - up when it gets this vs code setup part
21:32 - of the script and I looked these up so
21:35 - one of these uh we can see here and then
21:38 - it says to um you know check electron
21:41 - and things like that now I look that up
21:43 - and as far as I can tell uh it looks
21:45 - like it has something to do with a
21:47 - release that they had in February um I
21:49 - don't think it has anything to do with
21:50 - my script uh and that'll likely be fixed
21:53 - when they make their next update I would
21:56 - assume but if not and those warnings
21:58 - Linger on for too long uh then I will
22:01 - give my script a look and see exactly
22:02 - what it could be but I can't imagine
22:04 - that it's anything that I'm doing
22:05 - because I'm just uh running some very
22:08 - simple code that installs some very
22:10 - popular uh extensions but even with
22:12 - these warnings for uh that code command
22:15 - um it hasn't affected anything on my end
22:17 - it still sets all of the uh settings and
22:19 - everything uh the way that it should so
22:21 - I'm going to go ahead and continue the
22:23 - script here now once this gets to the
22:25 - Sublime Text part of the script it's
22:27 - going to maybe look a little bit weird
22:29 - because of how Sublime Text Works uh
22:31 - you're going to see Sublime Text open
22:33 - and close a couple of times on its own
22:35 - and like I said earlier that's because
22:38 - unlike VSS code some of the settings and
22:40 - folders don't get created until Sublime
22:42 - Text is open for the first time and
22:44 - those need to be created before I move
22:46 - over my custom settings so that's what
22:48 - it's doing there in the background and
22:50 - now what it's doing here is we can see
22:53 - that it says that it's opening Sublime
22:54 - to automatically install packages and to
22:57 - press enter after after all the packages
22:59 - are installed so whenever I moved over
23:02 - my package control settings and it had
23:04 - all of the applications within that file
23:07 - that I wanted to have installed we can
23:09 - see that it went through and it looks
23:11 - like it installed all of these correctly
23:14 - um now if you want to check within
23:16 - Sublime let me go ahead and make the
23:18 - text a little bit larger here um one
23:20 - thing that I would recommend is look
23:23 - down here in the bottom left and it'll
23:25 - show you if something is going on if a
23:27 - packag is installing uh there's nothing
23:29 - down there right now so these are
23:31 - probably all done but just to make uh
23:34 - double sure we can press uh control back
23:37 - tick and control back tick will open up
23:40 - our uh terminal down here at the bottom
23:43 - within Sublime Text and we can see
23:45 - everything that it did and check here
23:47 - for any errors but from what I can tell
23:50 - it looks like everything installed
23:53 - correctly so that looks good so I'm
23:55 - going to go ahead and close down
23:58 - Sublime Text go back to our script and
24:00 - press
24:01 - enter okay so after we closed down
24:04 - Sublime Text for the first time and
24:06 - continued with the installation it went
24:08 - over and moved all of my custom settings
24:10 - here um so now it looks a little bit
24:13 - more um if you've seen my videos uh how
24:16 - you would expect these scripts to look
24:19 - and we can see that it has the uh color
24:20 - themes and everything like that set up
24:22 - uh the way that I do in other videos so
24:25 - at this point the uh reason that I have
24:27 - this open back up again I say that um to
24:30 - go ahead and insert my Sublime teex
24:33 - license and things like that this is
24:35 - also where I like to check for errors so
24:39 - just to make sure that all of my custom
24:41 - settings are working properly I'll open
24:43 - up that terminal again um look for any
24:45 - errors that all looks good um so now I
24:48 - can just close this back down normally I
24:50 - would go ahead and put in my license key
24:52 - uh so that I'm not asked to enter it
24:54 - every time I'm working within Sublime um
24:57 - but since there's no no errors and I'm
24:58 - not putting in my license key now uh I'm
25:01 - just going to go ahead and press enter
25:02 - there and we can see that now it says
25:04 - that the installation is complete okay
25:07 - so now that that installation script is
25:09 - complete I'm going to go ahead and quit
25:10 - out of terminal and if I open that back
25:14 - up hopefully it has my terminal profile
25:17 - set up the way that I like it as well um
25:20 - so we can see that it's changed my uh
25:23 - prompt around here and if I navigate to
25:27 - that dot files directory which is a git
25:29 - repo then we can see here that uh my
25:32 - prompt is working to where it can tell
25:33 - that it's on a git repository and tells
25:35 - us that we are on the master Branch okay
25:38 - so this is all looking pretty good um
25:40 - you know you can test things as much as
25:42 - you want um if I wanted to see which
25:46 - zshell that I'm using I could do that
25:48 - and we can see that it appropriately set
25:50 - it up to where I'm using the homeb
25:51 - zshell I can do a brew list to see
25:56 - whoops and that's actually not uh-- list
25:59 - that's just a command for list so let me
26:03 - rerun that again and we can see that
26:05 - these are all the uh formula and cast
26:07 - that Brew installed okay so that's all
26:09 - looking good I'll go ahead and close
26:11 - down my terminal here and we can see
26:13 - that we have our desktop set as well but
26:15 - with that said that's basically it
26:17 - that's basically the entire process that
26:19 - I do on a new machine now that may have
26:22 - seemed like a long process since I was
26:25 - explaining everything along the way
26:27 - since I showed you the ins of an outs of
26:30 - you know a broad overview of what those
26:31 - dot files do but when I'm not recording
26:34 - and I'm only running these installation
26:36 - scripts uh that entire process actually
26:38 - goes by extremely quickly and gets my
26:41 - machines set up exactly how I like them
26:43 - in no time so if you are a developer who
26:46 - has a lot of you know customizations and
26:49 - different tools that you like to use I
26:51 - would highly recommend having a system
26:53 - like this uh set up in place for
26:55 - yourself before I used automated scripts
26:58 - like this you know I was constantly
27:00 - found myself forgetting how I set things
27:03 - up in a specific way needed to go back
27:05 - to my old machine to make sure
27:06 - everything was uh carried over correctly
27:09 - months later I would remember that I
27:11 - forgot to install a certain app that I
27:13 - used on a somewhat regular basis or that
27:16 - I forgot to log into something anything
27:18 - like that it just takes all the
27:20 - guesswork involved in stuff like that
27:22 - out um and doesn't keep me wondering if
27:25 - I've forgot something and then any time
27:27 - that I do use a new tool or um
27:31 - application uh what I'll do is I just
27:34 - keep these dot files here uh within my
27:37 - home folder and if I have a new tool
27:39 - that I want to add I just um come in
27:42 - here to myfile script and let's say that
27:46 - it's something I can install with Brew
27:48 - I'll just come down here and add it
27:50 - either to my packages for the command
27:52 - line or to my Cask list if it is you
27:55 - know like a browser or um something like
27:58 - that but with that said uh that's
28:00 - basically it uh now that I have this new
28:03 - machine set up I can actually record
28:05 - videos on here um so I'll be getting
28:08 - some new videos to you all very shortly
28:11 - that I have basically ready to go
28:13 - there's several uh that I already um
28:15 - have written and just need to be
28:17 - recorded So hopefully this video gave
28:19 - you all some ideas for how you can use
28:21 - some automated scripts in your own daily
28:23 - test uh and for anybody who's ever
28:25 - wondered or sent me messages as
28:27 - you know what software I'm using or how
28:29 - I have things configured um I hope that
28:31 - now you have a good idea of exactly
28:33 - where you can go uh to see exactly how I
28:36 - have have things set up they're all in
28:37 - those dot files there now like I said I
28:40 - would highly recommend if you want a
28:43 - setup like mine um to Fork my repository
28:47 - and to make your own custom changes
28:49 - because like I said it's just going to
28:51 - make all of those changes on your system
28:54 - and if you had it set up in a certain
28:56 - way and it's going to overwrite all
28:58 - those settings that you had so make sure
29:00 - you know what the scripts are doing uh
29:02 - before you run them uh I don't want to
29:05 - get a lot of messages uh after people
29:07 - watch this video after I've given that
29:09 - disclaimer you know a hundred times now
29:12 - uh that my script messed up you know
29:14 - messed up your system so be careful is
29:17 - all I'm saying make sure you know what
29:18 - the scripts are doing um make your own
29:20 - customizations and test around with it
29:22 - uh before running my specific scripts
29:25 - that I use for myself but with that said
