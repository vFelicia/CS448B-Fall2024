00:00 - hey how's it going everybody uh this
00:02 - video is going to be a little different
00:03 - from the tutorial videos that I usually
00:05 - do um in this video I want to talk about
00:08 - volunteering and ways for software
00:11 - Engineers uh computer programmers web
00:14 - developers and web designers to give
00:16 - back to their Community there's a great
00:18 - line from the book Tuesdays with Mory
00:21 - when the main character was talking
00:22 - about giving back to your community and
00:24 - he talks about not just giving back with
00:26 - money but giving back with your skill
00:28 - set and uh here's the line from that
00:30 - book he says I don't mean money I mean
00:33 - your time it's not so hard there's a
00:35 - senior center that opened near here
00:37 - dozens of elderly people come there
00:39 - every day if you're a young man or a
00:41 - young woman and you have a skill you're
00:43 - asked to come and teach it say you know
00:45 - computers you come there and you teach
00:46 - computers you're very welcome there and
00:48 - they are very grateful this is how you
00:50 - start to get respect by offering
00:52 - something that you have now I couldn't
00:54 - agree with this more um you know it's a
00:56 - win-win situation too because when you
00:58 - share a skill that you have not not only
01:00 - are you helping other people but it also
01:02 - helps you hone your own skills so this
01:05 - got me thinking um what are some
01:07 - different ways in which software
01:09 - engineers and programmers and developers
01:11 - and designers um what are some ways that
01:13 - they can volunteer their skills and give
01:15 - back to the community and you know
01:17 - overall have a positive impact on the
01:19 - world well first of all you could uh
01:21 - take the advice directly from the book
01:24 - you could volunteer at a senior center
01:25 - or you could volunteer at an assisted
01:27 - living home uh I took this approach a
01:29 - few years ago I volunteered at an
01:31 - Assisting Living assisted living home
01:33 - for one night a week uh for two or three
01:36 - hours depending on the number of people
01:37 - who needed help um now I'm not
01:40 - mentioning this for a pat on the back or
01:41 - anything like that I'm only telling you
01:43 - this because there's this misconception
01:46 - out there that uh elderly people aren't
01:48 - interested in technology and uh from
01:50 - doing this I know firsthand that uh
01:53 - that's just not true um they want to be
01:55 - connected just as much as anybody else
01:57 - does and uh but sometimes they simply
02:00 - have the means or have the knowledge uh
02:02 - to get things up and running themselves
02:04 - and not only that but um perhaps maybe
02:08 - the staff or other volunteers there
02:10 - might not have that ability to help them
02:11 - out either um so you know on a typical
02:14 - night of this type of volunteering uh
02:17 - you might help someone do something as
02:19 - simple as uh setting up a free Google
02:22 - email account so that they can start
02:24 - emailing their family uh receiving
02:26 - pictures of their grandchildren and when
02:28 - they do start receiving the those family
02:30 - pictures and staying in closer contact
02:32 - with the family it really does make
02:33 - their day now the great thing about this
02:35 - type of volunteer work is that you don't
02:38 - have to be a software engineer or an
02:40 - expert programmer to help with these
02:42 - kind of issues um the things that you
02:44 - would do uh in a situation like that are
02:46 - very simple tasks so um you know there's
02:48 - young kids out there who can get in
02:50 - there and set up email accounts and do
02:52 - basic computer troubleshooting like uh
02:55 - you know uh connecting computers to the
02:57 - internet and things like that now if
03:00 - you're looking for uh something that
03:02 - involves a more in-depth skill set then
03:05 - maybe you want to look into making a
03:06 - website for a local business free of
03:08 - charge um so perhaps there's a local
03:11 - farmers market or a pet shelter um you
03:14 - know it's easy to get the impression
03:16 - that every business in in your city has
03:19 - a website already but there's a lot of
03:21 - businesses out there that don't
03:22 - especially the local businesses um also
03:25 - I see a lot of developers and designers
03:27 - online uh that are always asking for
03:29 - advice and trying to come up with
03:31 - different projects that they can use to
03:34 - build up their portfolio so if you're
03:36 - wanting to learn how to build a website
03:37 - or get into something like WordPress
03:39 - development uh maybe you can build up
03:41 - your portfolio and help someone out at
03:42 - the same time so if you have a favorite
03:45 - local business in town that doesn't have
03:47 - a website or has a bad website then this
03:50 - could be a great project to take on one
03:52 - thing that might be consider it though
03:54 - is that if you do decide to do this and
03:56 - it's one of your first websites that
03:58 - you've that one of your first websites
04:00 - that you've ever made uh you might want
04:02 - to be sure to let the people know that
04:03 - it that your website might not be top
04:05 - quality uh but most likely if these
04:08 - people don't have a website already or
04:09 - if they have a really bad website uh
04:11 - then they're going to enjoy whatever
04:12 - additional exposure that you can provide
04:14 - them anyways um even if that's just a
04:17 - quick and easy website that displays you
04:19 - know their business address business
04:21 - hours contact information um if it's a
04:24 - restaurant maybe their menu and things
04:26 - like that now something else that you
04:28 - might want to look into
04:30 - is becoming a tutor um there's always
04:34 - opportunities to tutor people at just
04:36 - about any age that you're comfortable
04:38 - with and you know as engineers and
04:40 - programmers most of you have a lot of
04:43 - training in math and problem solving and
04:46 - coding and among other things um so to
04:49 - check out what tutoring opportunities
04:51 - are available in your area I would just
04:54 - recommend getting online and doing a
04:55 - quick Google search um and if that
04:57 - doesn't turn anything up uh you can
05:00 - usually ask people at your local public
05:02 - library if they have anything like that
05:04 - available uh I don't know if that's the
05:06 - norm or not but personally every town
05:09 - that I've ever lived in has had tutoring
05:11 - opportunities through their public
05:13 - libraries uh so if that's something that
05:15 - interest you then I would definitely
05:16 - check that out and speaking of tutoring
05:19 - I would definitely check uh with the
05:22 - maybe the schools in your area and see
05:25 - if there's a youth first robotics
05:27 - program uh first stands for for
05:30 - inspiration and recognition of Science
05:33 - and Technology it's a terrific program
05:35 - it gets uh kids of all different ages
05:37 - involved in science and technology um if
05:40 - you check the first robotics volunteer
05:42 - website uh that I'm at now this is USF
05:45 - first.org
05:47 - community/ volunteers uh you can find
05:50 - pretty much any information that you
05:51 - would need um how to get involved what
05:54 - to expect uh as a volunteer volunteer
05:58 - training and how to become a a mentor
06:00 - and a coach also if you look down here
06:02 - at the bottom it says that they have
06:04 - close to 27,000 teams worldwide so most
06:08 - likely you're going to be able to find a
06:10 - program like this in your
06:12 - area now if you are a female then one
06:16 - organization that you might want to look
06:17 - into getting involved with is called
06:20 - girls who code um so software and
06:23 - programming and coding is an industry
06:26 - that unfortunately has been pretty
06:27 - male-dominated throughout the years and
06:30 - girl who code from what I hear is uh is
06:33 - a great organization that's getting more
06:35 - females interested in the field of
06:37 - computer science um if you go to their
06:39 - website here they have this tab that is
06:42 - get involved um so if you click on that
06:45 - then you can see that they have a
06:47 - volunteering section
06:49 - here and if you look down through um the
06:52 - volunteering opportunities here U
06:54 - they've got a few listed as well as
06:57 - becoming an instructor at a girls who
06:59 - club or a girls who code Club so that
07:03 - would be a great one to check out now
07:05 - everything that I've mentioned so far
07:07 - has involved personal interaction in
07:10 - order to volunteer uh but if tutoring or
07:13 - helping uh in person isn't something
07:15 - that you're comfortable with then
07:17 - perhaps you could you know you could
07:19 - always try answering people's questions
07:21 - online at websites like stack Overflow
07:24 - or Reddit or some other online forums
07:27 - now I'm sure this wouldn't be considered
07:28 - official public service and any court of
07:30 - law or anything like that uh but I
07:32 - personally consider it a form of
07:34 - volunteering for sure um you and this is
07:37 - also something that I've been wanting to
07:38 - do more of myself um and for any of
07:42 - those people who answer questions on
07:44 - these sites who might be watching this
07:45 - video I would just like to give a big
07:47 - thank you because you know at this point
07:50 - I definitely receive a much larger
07:52 - benefit from these uh sites than the
07:55 - amount that I contribute to them um you
07:58 - know some people put in a a ton of time
08:01 - uh answering questions on these sites um
08:03 - some of these detailed answers could be
08:06 - entire articles themselves and the
08:08 - people who answer those questions uh
08:09 - they don't get anything from the time
08:11 - that they put in other than a thank you
08:13 - and maybe some reputation points or
08:15 - something like that there is an added
08:17 - bonus uh to being active in these
08:19 - communities um you know it's something
08:22 - that you can uh point a potential future
08:25 - employer to uh you can point them to the
08:27 - answers that you've given on these
08:29 - websites and prove how well that you
08:31 - know your stuff and you know there's not
08:33 - absolutely nothing wrong with putting
08:34 - your volunteer efforts on a resume or
08:37 - anything like that now somewhat similar
08:39 - to answering questions online you can
08:42 - also start your own blog or your own
08:44 - YouTube channel and start writing and
08:46 - making videos about problems that you've
08:48 - run into and how you solve them uh you
08:51 - can share your knowledge that way now
08:53 - this is kind of cheating because if
08:55 - there was one thing on the list of
08:57 - things that I'm going to show you in
08:58 - this video that I don't don't
08:59 - necessarily consider volunteer work uh
09:02 - it would be your own blog or your own
09:04 - YouTube channel because you can always
09:06 - put ads on your blog articles and on
09:08 - your videos and if those become popular
09:10 - enough then uh you'll get a little bit
09:11 - of money kicked back your way for that
09:13 - but I would still recommend uh that
09:16 - people do this if they can and if they
09:18 - have the time to do it because not only
09:20 - will it help you learn more about the
09:22 - topics that you write about uh but you
09:24 - never know how many people will run into
09:26 - those exact same problems that you have
09:28 - and then Find Your solution online now
09:31 - another thing you that you can do is
09:33 - contribute to open- Source projects
09:36 - there's a lot of Open Source projects
09:38 - out there uh that help people in need um
09:41 - I would recommend checking out github's
09:43 - showcases uh page here and see if
09:46 - there's something there that interests
09:47 - you you can see here that they have this
09:50 - made in Africa section um if you click
09:52 - on here uh you'll most likely be able to
09:55 - find some great projects to work on and
09:57 - you're going to see a common theme some
09:59 - of these projects you have uh
10:00 - interactive messaging messaging engine
10:04 - SMS gateway um pretty much keeping
10:07 - people uh ways of connecting people it's
10:09 - extremely important to get people
10:10 - connected um so that's one option uh if
10:14 - we go back here to the showcases page if
10:16 - you scroll down you also see this uh
10:19 - government app section and within this
10:21 - government app section you're going to
10:23 - see projects for NASA um code for
10:26 - America which is a great organization
10:29 - um you also see National Park Service
10:32 - making making mapping libraries for the
10:34 - National Park Service um so uh lot of
10:38 - projects that you could contribute to
10:40 - here now something else that you might
10:42 - want to check out is the Milla volunteer
10:45 - page now I've personally never
10:47 - volunteered through this site so I have
10:49 - no firsthand experience with it um I
10:51 - just saw that it was recommended online
10:54 - as a way for um tech people to volunteer
10:58 - uh but if you look down here it's pretty
11:00 - much exactly what we've been talking
11:01 - about you can see here it says it's
11:04 - about learning collaborating and sharing
11:06 - your skills with a global Community um
11:09 - coders organizers activists and things
11:12 - like that and you can see that if you
11:14 - click here that they say that you can
11:16 - volunteer as much as you like or as
11:19 - little as you like it's totally up to
11:20 - you and if you click on get involved it
11:24 - takes you to a page where you can be
11:26 - matched up with your skill set and with
11:28 - your interest that are most suitable for
11:31 - you so I think that this looks pretty
11:33 - neat and maybe it's something that I'm
11:35 - going to give a try in the future and if
11:37 - it's something that looks interesting to
11:38 - you then you should definitely give it a
11:40 - shot now one of the last things I want
11:42 - to talk to you about is that if you want
11:44 - to be involved but you just don't have
11:47 - the time to do it then there are ways
11:50 - that pretty much require uh very little
11:53 - to zero effort um you know as software
11:56 - engineers and programmers uh a lot of us
11:59 - are are very fortunate to work for great
12:01 - companies that pay well and that
12:03 - sometimes allows us to earn more money
12:05 - uh than we need for our personal needs
12:07 - so if that includes you then I would try
12:09 - to find a charity that is involved with
12:11 - causes that are close to your heart and
12:14 - commit the donating portions of your
12:15 - salary to those Charities um on top of
12:18 - your donations a lot of tech companies
12:20 - like Google and apple and Microsoft will
12:23 - match donations made by their employees
12:26 - so if you're somebody who's uh currently
12:29 - already donating to Charities uh
12:31 - definitely check with your employer and
12:33 - see if they offer a match because uh you
12:36 - could potentially be doubling those
12:37 - donations and you should definitely take
12:40 - advantage of that if they offer that and
12:42 - there's one last thing that I wanted to
12:44 - talk about uh before wrapping this up
12:47 - and this goes for anyone not just people
12:50 - in the tech industry so it's great to
12:53 - get excited about volunteering and doing
12:55 - good things in the world but try not to
12:57 - overdo yourself um you're going to have
12:59 - the greatest impact when this becomes
13:01 - part of your routine and part of your
13:03 - daily life uh you don't want this just
13:05 - to be a one-time thing so if you
13:07 - overexert yourself or if you uh put in
13:10 - more time than what you have available
13:12 - or if what you're doing becomes more of
13:14 - a chore than something that fulfills you
13:16 - then you're less likely to keep it up
13:18 - and you're less likely to try it again
13:19 - in the future so I would just recommend
13:22 - starting slow finding your comfort zone
13:25 - and uh I can promise you that it's
13:27 - something that you'll enjoy once you get
13:28 - started
13:29 - so that about does it for this video um
13:31 - you know there's tons of ways to get
13:33 - involved out there if I missed anything
13:35 - which I'm sure that I did um then you
13:37 - know just put your suggestions for
13:39 - getting involved in the comment section
13:40 - below so I hope this video was useful
13:43 - for everybody and thank you all for
13:45 - watching
