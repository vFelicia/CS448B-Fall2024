00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody now I
00:02 - know it's been a long time since I've
00:03 - released a video and maybe at some point
00:05 - in the future I'll go more into why it
00:07 - took me so long to get back into making
00:09 - tutorials uh but I'm not going to go
00:11 - into that here instead I figured we'd
00:14 - just jump right in and do something fun
00:16 - to get back into the swing of things so
00:18 - I was thinking we could do a simulation
00:20 - of some type and a couple of months ago
00:23 - the Powerball jackpot broke the record
00:25 - for the largest Lottery jackpot ever I
00:28 - believe it was even over two billion
00:31 - dollars if not close to that and
00:33 - ultimately I believe someone from
00:34 - California ended up winning that jackpot
00:36 - but it got me thinking that it might be
00:38 - fun to write a script to simulate
00:40 - playing the Powerball so I've seen a few
00:42 - scripts online that simulate your
00:44 - chances of hitting the jackpot but I
00:47 - thought that we could write one that
00:48 - takes all of the Lesser prizes into
00:50 - account as well that way you get a rough
00:52 - estimate of what you could expect to pay
00:55 - versus how much you could expect to win
00:57 - after playing the lottery a certain
00:58 - amount of times so so before we write
01:01 - this let me show you the output from our
01:04 - finished script and what that will look
01:06 - like so right now I have the finished
01:08 - script that we'll be writing in this
01:09 - video and right now I have it set to buy
01:13 - two Powerball tickets for each drawing
01:15 - and by a drawing I just mean when they
01:17 - draw the winning numbers and they
01:19 - actually draw Powerball tickets uh three
01:21 - times a week so if there's 52 weeks in a
01:25 - year times three then that's about 156
01:28 - drawings per year so in this simulation
01:31 - here we'd be buying two tickets for
01:34 - every drawing of the year and one more
01:36 - quick thing for people who don't really
01:37 - know about the Powerball let me also
01:40 - switch over to the odds here to explain
01:43 - exactly how Powerball works so you can
01:46 - kind of understand what the output from
01:49 - this script is going to be giving us so
01:51 - basically in Powerball you have five
01:54 - white balls and they are numbered
01:57 - between 1 and 69 and they also have red
02:02 - balls that are numbered between 1 and 26
02:05 - which is the Powerball so if you hit all
02:09 - five of the white numbers it doesn't
02:12 - matter what order as long as you get
02:13 - those numbers right and the Powerball
02:15 - then you win the grand prize but you can
02:18 - see that the odds of doing that are very
02:20 - low that's like one in 300 million but
02:23 - then we also have some lesser prizes
02:24 - here so if you hit all five without the
02:27 - Powerball then you win 1 million if you
02:30 - hit four plus the Powerball fifty
02:31 - thousand uh four only four white balls
02:34 - only is a hundred three plus the
02:36 - Powerball is a hundred and so on and you
02:39 - can see once we get down here if you
02:42 - just hit two by themselves then you
02:44 - don't win anything if you just hit one
02:46 - by itself you don't win anything you
02:47 - have to hit the Powerball with those to
02:49 - get anything and it's only seven dollars
02:51 - and four dollars so now let's go back to
02:54 - the script here and let me go ahead and
02:56 - run this and I'll explain the output of
02:59 - what we're going to have for this little
03:00 - simulation here so we played for an
03:03 - entire year and we spent uh 624 dollars
03:07 - it's two dollars per Powerball ticket I
03:09 - should say that so we spent 624 dollars
03:12 - our earnings were 67 and I also uh
03:16 - wanted to keep track of how many times
03:18 - uh we hit each of the prizes so 5 plus P
03:22 - would be the jackpot that's five white
03:24 - balls plus the Powerball uh this one's
03:27 - just five white balls four plus p p
03:30 - um and so on so the zero here is just
03:33 - that we didn't get any of the prizes so
03:36 - you can see that the majority of the
03:37 - time 296 times we didn't get any of the
03:40 - prizes 11 times we hit the Powerball
03:43 - only
03:44 - um four times we got one plus the
03:46 - Powerball and you can see here one of
03:48 - the times we got three white balls but
03:51 - no Powerball okay so now that we've got
03:53 - an idea of what we're actually going to
03:54 - be writing uh let's go ahead and go over
03:58 - to an empty script here and let's go
04:01 - ahead and get started on writing this
04:02 - now I will say right off the bat that
04:05 - this script is probably going to have a
04:07 - lot more code than it actually needs
04:09 - because I want to simulate this in the
04:11 - way that the lottery is actually played
04:13 - so for example I'm going to be grabbing
04:16 - random numbers for each drawing and each
04:19 - ticket that we buy but I think
04:21 - statistically we get the same results if
04:23 - I only generated the winning numbers
04:25 - once and compared everything to that but
04:28 - I just want it to be as close to the
04:29 - actual Lottery as possible even if it
04:32 - does slow down the execution of our code
04:34 - a good bit okay so with that said in
04:37 - order to get started on writing a
04:40 - simulation like this let's first put in
04:42 - some constants so first let's define our
04:45 - options for the white balls and also the
04:47 - options for the Powerball and like I
04:50 - said the white balls range from 1 to 69.
04:53 - nice so we'll just make this a list of
04:56 - numbers by saying white underscore score
05:00 - possibilities is
05:03 - equal to and we'll just do a list of
05:07 - range from 1 to 70 because this last
05:12 - number here is not inclusive and then we
05:16 - will also do
05:17 - the white possibles in the same way and
05:21 - the power balls range from 1 to 26 so
05:24 - I'll put a 27 there and
05:27 - let's just rename that to red possibles
05:31 - and now that we have that let's define
05:33 - how many tickets that we want to buy
05:35 - each time there's a drawing and also how
05:38 - many drawings that we want to simulate
05:40 - so I'll just say tickets per drawing is
05:44 - equal to one for now and then number of
05:47 - drawings is equal to one and lastly here
05:51 - to keep track of how much money we've
05:54 - spent and how much money we've earned
05:56 - let's go ahead and do a couple of
05:58 - constants there so I'll say total spent
06:00 - is equal to zero and earnings is equal
06:04 - to
06:05 - zero okay and some of the code I'm going
06:09 - to pull from a Snippets file just
06:11 - because I'm a slow typer and I know that
06:12 - you all don't want to watch me type out
06:14 - some of these uh longer consonants here
06:17 - but I also want to keep track of how
06:19 - many times we hit different prizes and
06:21 - I'll keep track of this with a
06:22 - dictionary of all the possible outcomes
06:25 - so if I go to the Snippets file here
06:27 - then let me grab this dictionary
06:31 - and paste this in and all this is is
06:34 - what we saw before times one is going to
06:38 - be for all the different prizes so five
06:40 - plus Powerball five four plus Powerball
06:42 - and so on and for anybody following
06:45 - along as usual I'll have uh the Snippets
06:47 - and the code in the description section
06:50 - below okay so with that set up in place
06:53 - we're ready to actually simulate some
06:56 - Powerball drawings so first of all uh we
06:59 - need to Loop through the number of
07:01 - drawings that we want to simulate and
07:04 - draw the winning numbers for each of
07:06 - those so we'll just say 4
07:09 - drawing in
07:11 - range
07:13 - of our number of drawings
07:16 - and now we're at that we're at this
07:18 - point what we want to do is to draw our
07:22 - winning numbers now I'm going to
07:24 - separate them out into the white balls
07:26 - and the Powerball so for the white balls
07:29 - let's take a random sample of five balls
07:32 - from the list of possibilities that we
07:34 - made earlier first to do this we're
07:36 - going to need to import the random
07:38 - module and this is a built-in module so
07:40 - you don't need to pip install anything
07:42 - so here at the top of our file I'll just
07:46 - say import random and then back down
07:50 - here in our Loop to get a random sample
07:52 - of five unique balls we can just say
07:55 - that our white drawing is going to be
07:58 - equal to
08:00 - random dot sample
08:03 - and we want to take a sample from those
08:07 - white possibles and we're going to set k
08:10 - equal to 5 to say that we want a sample
08:13 - of five of those now if you've never
08:15 - used the random module and want to learn
08:17 - more about how to use this in detail
08:20 - then I do have an entire video on the
08:22 - random module and I'll be sure to put a
08:24 - link to that in the description section
08:25 - below so random.sample here is going to
08:28 - return a list which is fine there's ways
08:31 - that we can make that work but since
08:33 - this is a unique set of numbers let's
08:36 - just go ahead and cast this to be a set
08:40 - um
08:40 - so and this will also make it easier to
08:44 - help us when comparing our numbers to
08:46 - the ticket numbers in a bit so to cast
08:49 - this to a set we can just wrap that
08:52 - in a set now for the Powerball this is
08:55 - just going to be a single number so we
08:57 - can just use random.choice to get one
09:01 - value from those possibilities so we can
09:04 - just say red drawing is equal to
09:08 - random.choice and we want a choice from
09:12 - those red possibles okay so now we have
09:14 - the white balls the random white balls
09:18 - from the drawing and we have the
09:19 - Powerball and there's probably a lot of
09:22 - different ways that we could combine
09:23 - these into you know one winning drawing
09:25 - and honestly we wouldn't even need to
09:28 - combine them at all but I feel like this
09:30 - will be easier to read if we combine
09:32 - both of those into uh you know one value
09:35 - now I'm going to do this with a
09:37 - dictionary so that it's easier to read
09:38 - but you could also use a list or
09:41 - probably you know a few other ways so
09:44 - I'm just going to say that the winning
09:46 - numbers are equal to and I'm going to
09:50 - make this a dictionary
09:51 - and
09:53 - I'm going to have a key of whites here
09:56 - and I will pass in our set of white
10:00 - numbers
10:01 - and then
10:03 - I will have a key of red here and just
10:06 - pass in our red drawing okay so now we
10:09 - have the winning numbers here from a
10:12 - single drawing now remember we also gave
10:14 - ourselves the option to buy multiple
10:16 - tickets per drawing so let's Loop
10:19 - through the number of tickets that we
10:20 - plan to buy for each drawing so first
10:24 - let's just go ahead and loop through
10:26 - these by saying four ticket in
10:31 - our range of tickets per drawing now
10:35 - since We're looping through our tickets
10:36 - here if you remember I have this total
10:40 - spent up here and
10:43 - these are two dollars per ticket so
10:47 - let's just increment that by two each
10:50 - time we go through this Loop and now
10:52 - this is going to be similar to what we
10:53 - just did up here because we're just
10:56 - going to grab some random numbers for
10:58 - our tickets now if you have some you
11:01 - know favorite lucky numbers or something
11:03 - then you can just hard code those in you
11:06 - can just set this to you know buy one
11:08 - ticket and then hard code in your lucky
11:09 - numbers or something like that but if
11:12 - you buy multiple tickets at a store then
11:14 - usually they just print you off random
11:16 - numbers if you don't ask for specific
11:18 - ones so this is going to be basically
11:20 - the same here but let's just change this
11:23 - to be let's see my whites for the white
11:26 - balls and then
11:28 - say my red for the red ball and just
11:32 - like before let's go ahead and put this
11:35 - into a dictionary and instead of winning
11:39 - numbers I will call these my numbers
11:43 - and we will set the whites key equal to
11:47 - the white balls for us my white and then
11:50 - for the red we will do my red now like I
11:54 - said before this code is going to look a
11:56 - little long most of you might be
11:58 - thinking that we can you know condense
12:00 - this down with a good bit of you know
12:02 - some clever list comprehensions and
12:04 - things like that and you'd be absolutely
12:06 - right and definitely feel free to do
12:08 - that if you're following along but I
12:10 - just think that it's easier to read this
12:12 - way for people learning to simulate
12:14 - something like this for the first time
12:16 - okay so now we have our numbers for a
12:19 - specific ticket now we want to compare
12:22 - our numbers with the winning numbers and
12:24 - calculate how much we've actually won
12:26 - from that ticket now before we think
12:29 - about how we're going to do this one
12:32 - thing that I like to do if I get stuck
12:33 - writing code is to kind of just move
12:36 - forward one step at a time so let's say
12:39 - for the sake of argument that we get
12:40 - stuck here and we don't really know the
12:43 - exact law logic of how to calculate how
12:45 - much money we win off of a single ticket
12:47 - well if we haven't figured that out yet
12:50 - then let's just simply write a function
12:52 - with the name that we're trying to do
12:55 - even just doing this alone can help our
12:58 - thought process start working on a
13:00 - problem so let's write a function and we
13:04 - want to calculate the win amount so I'll
13:08 - call this function
13:09 - calculate when amount abbreviated now
13:13 - this function doesn't actually exist yet
13:15 - so I want to comment this out for now
13:18 - and let's go ahead and create this
13:19 - function here at the top of the file
13:22 - actually I'll put it underneath our
13:24 - constants here so let's create this
13:26 - function of calculate one amount and in
13:29 - order to calculate how much we've
13:31 - actually won we need to know the numbers
13:34 - that I have on my ticket compared to the
13:39 - winning numbers
13:40 - in the winning drawing
13:42 - and
13:44 - we'll just set a win amount here to zero
13:47 - for now
13:49 - and then whoops that went to 50 000 for
13:52 - some reason and now let's return that
13:55 - win amount so like I was saying if we
13:58 - get stuck then I think that it helps
14:01 - just by defining a function with
14:04 - parameters and return values like this
14:06 - just because you know it still might not
14:08 - be clear of the exact logic that we want
14:11 - but at least we're putting the
14:12 - parameters in place so that we know what
14:15 - we're working with and at least makes it
14:17 - clear where we'll solve this problem uh
14:20 - once we are working on a solution so
14:22 - just a small tip there that helps me
14:24 - from time to time whenever I get stuck
14:26 - but now let's go ahead and finish
14:28 - writing this function and see how we can
14:30 - compare our ticket to the winning
14:32 - numbers and calculate our actual
14:34 - winnings now if you remember uh from our
14:38 - graphic over here all we're going to
14:40 - need to do is we're going to need to see
14:42 - how many of our white numbers match up
14:46 - with their white numbers and if we hit
14:49 - the Powerball or not so we're going to
14:52 - need to need a way to see how many of
14:55 - our numbers are the same as the winning
14:58 - numbers now if you remember we used
15:01 - dictionaries as these values if I go
15:03 - back down here
15:05 - these here are what we're going to be
15:08 - passing into our calculate when amount
15:11 - function so these are dictionaries with
15:14 - the keys of whites and red so if I
15:17 - wanted to grab the white numbers for my
15:21 - ticket then
15:23 - I could just say
15:25 - my numbers and access
15:27 - that White's key and if I wanted to get
15:31 - the white numbers from the
15:35 - winning drawing then I can just say
15:37 - winning numbers and access that White's
15:40 - key there and also we have to remember
15:42 - that the values of these keys are these
15:48 - sets of numbers so we're working with
15:50 - two sets of numbers here now since this
15:53 - is a set and not a list we actually have
15:55 - a very easy built-in method for doing
15:58 - this called intersection and I have a
16:01 - previous video where I go over sets and
16:03 - talk about the different methods that we
16:05 - can use with sets so again if you'd like
16:07 - to see more of what we can do with that
16:09 - then I'll leave a link to that video in
16:11 - the description section below but for
16:13 - now if we want to get the matching
16:16 - numbers between these two sets then we
16:19 - can simply use a set method called
16:23 - intersection
16:26 - so right here I'm saying hey for my uh
16:29 - White numbers the set of my white
16:31 - numbers I want to run this intersection
16:33 - and I want to intersect that with the
16:37 - winning numbers uh whites and what that
16:40 - is going to return is it's going to
16:42 - return another set of the same values
16:45 - that are in both of those sets now we're
16:48 - not interested in the exact values we're
16:51 - more interested in how many numbers we
16:54 - matched you know so we can see okay I
16:56 - have one of the white balls is the same
16:59 - or two of the white balls is the same
17:00 - and so on so
17:02 - to get the number we can just wrap this
17:05 - entire thing
17:07 - into a length and get the length of that
17:11 - intersection so this entire thing here
17:13 - should give us how many white numbers we
17:17 - matched from our ticket to the winning
17:18 - numbers so I will just put this into a
17:23 - variable called White matches now in
17:26 - terms of determining whether the
17:28 - Powerball is a match or not is going to
17:30 - be a lot easier because all we're going
17:32 - to have to do is we'll have a
17:34 - conditional seeing if that specific
17:36 - number matches so we can just say power
17:40 - match is equal to and we just want to
17:45 - say
17:45 - my numbers and grab that red value and
17:49 - we just want to see is that equal to the
17:53 - winning numbers
17:55 - red value
17:57 - and let's go ahead and put these
18:00 - in some parentheses here
18:02 - well never mind my code formatter
18:04 - doesn't like those so
18:07 - we'll just keep going now all this is
18:09 - doing here is uh this conditional here
18:12 - is going to return a true or a false
18:14 - value so if they do match then power
18:17 - match will be true and if they don't
18:19 - match then power match will be false
18:21 - okay so now that we know how many white
18:23 - matches we have and whether we have a
18:26 - Powerball match all we need to do now is
18:28 - write conditionals that are the same as
18:31 - the powerball's rules and then assign
18:33 - the amount that we win for each of those
18:36 - conditionals now again I'm going to grab
18:39 - some of this code for my code snippet
18:41 - because these are just going to be a lot
18:44 - of different conditionals but these are
18:46 - mostly going to all look the same aside
18:48 - from the number of matches and the
18:50 - winning amount but first let's go ahead
18:52 - and write the first one here and then
18:55 - I'll paste in the others so first let's
18:57 - check if we won the actual jackpot so
19:02 - if our white matches is equal to 5 then
19:07 - that means that we matched all five of
19:10 - those white balls and now we want to
19:13 - check if we match the Powerball so if I
19:16 - say if power match within this
19:19 - conditional so if we hit 5 and we hit
19:23 - the Powerball then that's the jackpot
19:25 - and the jackpot varies but so we can put
19:29 - in you know whatever we want here this
19:31 - goes up and down depending on uh if
19:35 - anybody's hit the jackpot recently or
19:37 - not but since I decided to write this
19:39 - based on that two billion dollar ticket
19:42 - let's go ahead and make this big and
19:44 - make it a two billion dollar ticket just
19:46 - like we're playing for that one a couple
19:48 - of months ago now if you remember we're
19:51 - also keeping track of how many times we
19:54 - hit each of these prizes so let's go
19:57 - ahead and also increment this as well so
20:01 - I can say times 1 and we want to access
20:04 - that key and that key was 5 plus p
20:09 - and we'll just increment that by 1. now
20:13 - I'll also put in an else statement here
20:15 - now we're still Within
20:18 - this outer conditional here we're still
20:21 - saying that we hit five of the whites
20:24 - but this else here is just saying okay
20:26 - if we hit 5 but we didn't get the
20:28 - Powerball then we actually still win
20:31 - something here but the win amount is set
20:34 - to let me check over here real quick
20:36 - yeah that is one million so we can just
20:41 - set that equal to
20:44 - 1 million and here instead of the times
20:48 - 1 being 5 plus the Powerball which would
20:51 - be the jackpot this is just going to be
20:54 - 5 without the Powerball so this right
20:58 - here is basically what each of these
21:00 - conditionals is going to look like with
21:02 - just a few changes to uh you know the
21:05 - numbers here and the win amounts so
21:07 - instead of boring you guys to death
21:09 - while I write all of these out I'm just
21:11 - going to grab these from a code snippet
21:13 - and paste it in so I have this down here
21:17 - so let me grab this and then we'll go
21:20 - over and kind of look once we're done
21:23 - here now the only difference here once I
21:25 - paste this in
21:26 - is that the second conditional here is
21:30 - an L If instead of an if because we you
21:33 - know if we hit five then we don't want
21:35 - to check if we hit four after that so
21:36 - this is going to be an L If instead of
21:38 - an if so let's just go through these
21:40 - really quick so uh after this
21:43 - conditional here if we didn't hit 5 then
21:46 - we're saying okay well did we match four
21:48 - if we did match four did we hit the
21:50 - Powerball if so that one amount is going
21:52 - to be fifty thousand we're in comparing
21:54 - the times one if we hit four without a
21:57 - Powerball we only get a hundred if we
21:59 - match three with a Powerball we get a
22:02 - hundred uh if we don't get the Powerball
22:04 - we only get seven and so on and down
22:07 - here if you remember we don't get
22:09 - anything for just matching two we
22:12 - actually have to match two and the
22:13 - Powerball to get any win so that's why
22:16 - we're just saying if white matches is
22:18 - equal to two and the Powerball and
22:21 - that's also the same thing for one if we
22:23 - get one match and a Powerball then we
22:25 - get four dollars back and also we get
22:29 - money if we hit just the Powerball as
22:31 - well which is also four dollars and then
22:33 - at the very end we're just saying else
22:35 - uh if we didn't hit any of these then
22:38 - I'm just saying that we didn't win and
22:41 - that we're going to increment
22:42 - um that we hit zero and uh go with that
22:45 - as well okay so with that we already
22:48 - have all of our win amounts assigned for
22:51 - each possible outcome and we're already
22:53 - returning the win amount down here at
22:55 - the end of our function so that's going
22:58 - to be all that we need for this function
23:00 - so now we're basically done with our
23:03 - simulation script here all the hard work
23:05 - is done and out of the way now we just
23:07 - have to wrap up a couple of things at
23:08 - the bottom of the script and then print
23:11 - this out okay so first since we actually
23:14 - created this function now and this
23:17 - function is returning the correct win
23:19 - amount for each ticket all we need to do
23:21 - is set this to a value so I'm going to
23:24 - say that our win amount is equal to
23:27 - calculate when amount function and we
23:31 - want to pass in
23:32 - my numbers
23:34 - and compare those to
23:37 - the winning numbers and since this is
23:39 - the win amount for a single ticket we
23:42 - are also keeping track of our total
23:44 - earnings for all of our tickets so let's
23:47 - increment that value as well now if I go
23:50 - up here to my constants that was
23:52 - earnings I forgot what I called that so
23:55 - we can say that earnings plus equals
23:58 - that when amount and that's basically
24:02 - everything now all we need to do is just
24:04 - print out our results and then run some
24:07 - simulations so
24:09 - outside of all of our Loops here all we
24:12 - want to do is print and we'll just do an
24:16 - F string here and we'll say that we
24:19 - spent and then
24:21 - put in a dollar sign there and that was
24:25 - total spent
24:26 - and then let's put in how much we earned
24:30 - so we'll say earnings and that was
24:35 - called earnings and let's also print out
24:38 - our dictionary where it shows how many
24:40 - times we hit each prize with all of our
24:42 - tickets now if we just print it out
24:44 - directly then it's going to be a little
24:46 - difficult to read so a good way to print
24:48 - out dictionaries where they're easy to
24:50 - read is just to use the built-in Json
24:52 - library and this is super easy all we
24:56 - need to do is come up here and import
24:57 - Json
24:59 - import Json and then down here at the
25:03 - bottom we can just dump this dictionary
25:06 - to a string by saying Json dot dump s
25:10 - and
25:12 - that dictionary was called times one
25:17 - so times one and to make this look
25:22 - pretty we can set an indent equal to 2
25:25 - to where it indents those values out and
25:28 - again as usual if you want to know more
25:30 - about the Json library and how to work
25:33 - with that then I do have a specific
25:35 - video on that as well so I will also
25:37 - leave a link to that video in the
25:39 - description section below okay so that
25:41 - should be everything that we need but
25:43 - let's go ahead and run a few simulations
25:45 - here and make sure that we're getting
25:47 - the results that we expect now the main
25:50 - thing that we're going to have to change
25:51 - here for different runs of this script
25:53 - is going to be the number of tickets
25:57 - that we want to buy per drawing and the
25:59 - number of drawings that we want to
26:01 - simulate so right now we have this set
26:03 - to one ticket for one drawing so let's
26:06 - say there's that big two billion dollar
26:09 - prize and we just go out and we buy our
26:12 - one ticket for that one drawing and
26:14 - we're going to see if we hit it big so
26:17 - let's go ahead red and run that and
26:20 - unfortunately it doesn't look like we
26:23 - won we spent two dollars we earned zero
26:25 - and we can see down here
26:27 - um that that zero was incremented by one
26:30 - there so we didn't win on that drawing
26:32 - okay so let's say that we really want to
26:35 - win that jackpot so instead of just
26:37 - buying one ticket
26:39 - let's buy a hundred tickets so we're
26:41 - going to spend 200 trying to win this
26:44 - two billion dollar cash prize so we're
26:47 - buying a hundred tickets just for this
26:48 - one drawing let's go ahead and run that
26:51 - and we can see that we spent two hundred
26:53 - dollars we only earned 12 and 97 of our
26:58 - tickets were losses on one of them we
27:00 - hit just the Powerball one was one plus
27:02 - a Powerball or actually two or one plus
27:04 - a Powerball so that's how you would just
27:06 - simulate one drawing
27:09 - um but let's say you know maybe you're
27:12 - thinking okay well I'm not just gonna
27:14 - buy you know a lot of tickets for just
27:18 - one drawing I'm going to spread it out
27:19 - over the year so I'm just going to buy
27:21 - five tickets and
27:24 - let's see if I think there was yeah we
27:27 - said there was 156 drawings per year so
27:30 - we'll just buy five tickets for every
27:32 - drawing uh for an entire year let's run
27:35 - that and see how that looks so we can
27:37 - see in that entire year that we spent uh
27:40 - fifteen hundred and sixty dollars we
27:43 - only earned 215. we did get one here
27:46 - that where we matched um three white
27:49 - balls plus the Powerball so now let's
27:51 - take this and do some bigger numbers
27:54 - here so let's say that
27:58 - somebody has plenty of money and they
28:01 - really want to win a jackpot at some
28:03 - point in their life so let's
28:06 - uh buy 100 tickets for your entire
28:11 - lifetime so if 156 is one year let's say
28:15 - that you live a very long life so that
28:17 - would be 10 years if I had another zero
28:19 - on here that would be a hundred years so
28:21 - for every single drawing uh you're
28:24 - buying 100 tickets which would be 200
28:27 - and you're going to do that for your
28:29 - entire lifetime for every drawing so
28:31 - this is 100 tickets for a hundred years
28:34 - let's go ahead and run this and see what
28:37 - we get this is going to take a little
28:39 - bit longer okay so we got our results
28:42 - here and we can see that we
28:46 - over our lifetime we spent three million
28:50 - dollars and one hundred and twenty
28:52 - thousand uh on tickets uh but we only
28:55 - made three hundred thousand dollars in
28:58 - return so let's see what's the best we
29:00 - did here so we can see that most of
29:02 - these uh we lost completely
29:05 - um we hit a lot of uh powerballs 40 000
29:09 - of those and these numbers kind of go
29:10 - down as we go up and the best that we
29:13 - did was hitting four whites plus a
29:15 - single Powerball and we only did that
29:17 - one time in our life now that's the
29:21 - funny thing about the lottery because a
29:23 - lot of people don't really comprehend
29:24 - the statistics stacked against them when
29:27 - they play uh because you know like I
29:30 - said there was somebody who did win that
29:33 - two billion dollar jackpot in real life
29:35 - uh so people think well you know that
29:38 - could be me and it could be but
29:40 - statistically speaking it's almost
29:42 - impossible because we bought a hundred
29:45 - tickets for every drawing for 100
29:46 - hundred years and never even came close
29:48 - to hitting the jackpot we didn't even
29:50 - get the one million dollar prize and
29:52 - that makes sense if you think about it
29:54 - because since we spent uh 3 million and
29:58 - 120 000 dollars uh at two dollars a
30:02 - ticket that means that we bought you
30:04 - know roughly 1.5 million tickets but the
30:07 - odds of hitting the jackpot are almost
30:10 - one in 300 million so we just get this
30:14 - warped perception of it being more
30:15 - possible than it is uh just because
30:17 - there's millions and millions of these
30:20 - tickets being sold each week and out of
30:23 - those crazy possibilities sometimes
30:25 - somebody does hit it big now it's
30:27 - actually easy to change around our
30:29 - simulation a bit here too if we want so
30:32 - for example
30:34 - um if you have some you know like I said
30:37 - if you have some personal lucky numbers
30:38 - then you could just code those in
30:40 - directly instead of randomly generating
30:42 - tickets like we're doing here also
30:45 - another way that we can change this
30:47 - script is to actually simulate how long
30:49 - it would take to hit the jackpot if we
30:52 - did buy a hundred tickets for each
30:54 - drawing so let's just assume that we
30:57 - could live forever and we want to know
30:59 - how long it would take for us to bring
31:01 - in that 2 billion dollars well if we
31:04 - wanted to see that then we could easily
31:06 - change this script around a bit here so
31:09 - if I go down to our Loop where We're
31:11 - looping over our drawings right here
31:13 - where We're looping over our drawings
31:15 - let's just change this to a conditional
31:18 - of while true so basically we're saying
31:21 - hey I don't care you know how many
31:24 - drawings I say I want I just want to
31:27 - keep going until I win and I'm going to
31:31 - code in a couple of other things here
31:33 - too first of all we just want to go
31:36 - until we actually hit the jackpot so I'm
31:38 - going to say hit jackpot is equal to
31:41 - false and I'm also going to keep track
31:44 - of how many drawings we go through and
31:47 - so I'll say drawings is equal to zero
31:50 - and years is equal to zero so we'll keep
31:55 - track of the number of years that it
31:56 - takes us to hit the jackpot as well so
31:59 - right inside of our conditional here
32:01 - um remember this is going to be
32:05 - one drawing each time it goes through
32:07 - this Loop here
32:09 - and then
32:11 - in our inner loop here where we are
32:14 - checking our tickets all I'm going to do
32:17 - here is I'm going to check this win
32:19 - amount so
32:21 - I want to say if
32:23 - that win amount is equal to that 2
32:28 - billion that we are
32:30 - looking to hit oops and this needs to be
32:34 - double equals there for a conditional
32:36 - then we are going to set that variable
32:39 - of hit jackpot equal to true and since
32:43 - we finally hit that jackpot then I'm
32:45 - going to break out of this inner loop
32:49 - now we also want to break out of this
32:52 - outer loop but we can't do that from
32:54 - this inner loop here so what we can do
32:58 - is we can go to our outer loop here at
33:02 - the bottom and I can just say okay
33:05 - if
33:07 - after that run
33:08 - we hit the jackpot then break and break
33:12 - out of this outer loop as well now I
33:16 - also said I wanted to keep track of how
33:18 - many years it would take until we
33:21 - actually hit the jackpot so I can keep
33:25 - track of that by saying if drawings
33:27 - which is the number of drawings that
33:30 - we've gone through we can do a mod 156
33:34 - on this equals equals zero and basically
33:37 - what this is here is we're just dividing
33:39 - this by 156 and if the remainder is zero
33:43 - then it means that's been an entire year
33:45 - because there's 156 drawings for each
33:48 - year so that's one easy way for us to
33:51 - tell so then I can say years is plus
33:55 - equals 1 and increment that and just to
34:00 - keep our sanity because this might take
34:02 - a while
34:03 - let's go ahead and print how many years
34:06 - have passed also this will just let us
34:10 - know that our script's actually running
34:11 - because sometimes it can take a long
34:13 - time until you hit the jackpot okay so
34:16 - that should do it so now if I run this
34:20 - code then it's going to start looping
34:22 - through and trying to hit the jackpot
34:24 - and it'll break out once we do now this
34:28 - could and likely will take a pretty long
34:30 - time so I'm just going to go ahead and
34:33 - fast forward until we actually hit the
34:36 - jackpot and check back in once we've
34:39 - done that
34:40 - okay so we finally hit a jackpot here we
34:44 - can see that we have one jackpot let's
34:47 - see it took us 7
34:51 - 385 years and remember that's buying a
34:55 - hundred tickets each drawing uh which
34:58 - even that is very unlikely uh that any
35:01 - of us would ever do that because that's
35:03 - six hundred dollars every week and
35:05 - that's a lot of money but even under
35:07 - that scenario it still took us over
35:09 - seven thousand years to hit that jackpot
35:12 - so if there's one take away from this
35:15 - video only play the jackpot if you have
35:17 - the money and are looking to have some
35:20 - fun on a universally small chance of
35:22 - winning uh but if you're someone who
35:25 - can't afford it then don't go into it
35:27 - with an expectation of being that one
35:29 - person to hit it big because like we saw
35:31 - here that is going to be almost
35:34 - impossible now we ended up spending uh
35:38 - let's see here 200 and 30 million
35:42 - dollars but remember we had that two
35:44 - billion dollar jackpot so
35:46 - um once we hit the jackpot our earnings
35:48 - did outweigh what we spent but again
35:51 - that's also using the biggest jackpot
35:54 - ever in history so uh yeah I I wouldn't
36:00 - expect to ever have your earnings go
36:02 - above your spendings here
36:04 - um now if I divide this by two let's see
36:08 - that would be what 115 million so we
36:12 - actually did pretty good we only bought
36:14 - 115 or 100 yeah 115 million tickets if
36:19 - we go back here to uh the odds then
36:22 - remember the odds are actually one in
36:25 - almost 300 million uh so we actually
36:29 - surpassed the odds there a little bit so
36:32 - normally with the situation that we've
36:34 - set up here you know you could even get
36:37 - into a scenario where you could play for
36:40 - 14 18 000 years or 21 000 years and
36:43 - still not hit the jackpot so it takes a
36:46 - long time but with that said I think
36:49 - that's going to do it for this video now
36:51 - like I said earlier this is not a very
36:53 - efficient script statistically I don't
36:56 - believe that it matters if we're
36:58 - generating random numbers for each
37:00 - drawing and that is going to slow down
37:03 - this simulation by a lot we could
37:06 - probably get to thousands and thousands
37:08 - of years much faster than we did here
37:11 - but I just like doing it this way
37:14 - because it's more true to how the actual
37:16 - Lottery is done and also doing it this
37:19 - way might give us some more ideas for
37:21 - how to simulate you know other examples
37:23 - like this in the future where those
37:25 - types of things actually would matter so
37:28 - I kind of like breaking the problem down
37:30 - to do it the way that it's actually done
37:32 - in real life so as for it being a slow
37:35 - script uh trust me I know that because I
37:38 - just sat there and watched that count up
37:41 - to
37:42 - 7 000 years until we hit the jackpot so
37:45 - yeah it could be a lot faster than it
37:47 - actually is uh also like I said I know
37:50 - that this has been my first video in a
37:52 - very very long time but I hope that you
37:55 - all had fun with this one and possibly
37:57 - learned a little of something along the
37:58 - way but as far as new content I promise
38:01 - you all that I'm feeling a lot more
38:02 - motivated to get back into recording
38:04 - these and I hope that this year is going
38:06 - to have uh video releases much more
38:09 - often than there has been previously and
38:12 - I promise to keep you all updated on
38:13 - those tutorials that I plan to release
38:15 - but with that said if anybody has any
38:17 - questions about what we covered in this
