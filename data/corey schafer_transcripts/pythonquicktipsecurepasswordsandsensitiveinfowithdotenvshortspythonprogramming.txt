00:00 - when writing python code that requires
00:02 - passwords or other sensitive information
00:04 - you never want to have this hard-coded
00:05 - into your Project's codebase for obvious
00:07 - security reasons it's best to keep
00:08 - sensitive information within environment
00:10 - variables that are local to our machines
00:12 - in Python this is made especially easy
00:14 - using the EnV package first you'll
00:17 - install this package using uh pip by
00:19 - saying pip install Python d.v and then
00:22 - within your project you're going to
00:24 - create a EnV file that holds this
00:27 - sensitive information you can now place
00:28 - it there the most important part is to
00:30 - then add this file to our get ignore
00:33 - file so that it's not pushed with the
00:35 - rest of our code otherwise we're
00:37 - defeating the entire purpose of what
00:38 - we're hoping to accomplish with all of
00:40 - this in place we can now access that
00:43 - information from within our python
00:45 - script using thatv module if you'd like
00:49 - more in-depth programming tutorials be
