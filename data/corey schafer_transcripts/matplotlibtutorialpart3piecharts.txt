00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to create pie charts and pie charts
00:04 - are pretty simple to use they're similar
00:06 - to bar charts that we looked at in the
00:08 - last video but instead of plotting
00:10 - certain values for each category
00:11 - it's instead going to show us the
00:13 - proportion that each category
00:14 - contributes to a whole so basically just
00:17 - like the name implies you can think of
00:18 - our chart as a pie and each category
00:21 - will be a slice of that pie and the
00:23 - larger the slice means that category has
00:25 - more of whatever values were measuring
00:28 - so let's go ahead and jump into this and
00:30 - see some examples but real quick I'd
00:33 - also like to mention that we do have a
00:34 - sponsor for this series of videos and
00:36 - that is brilliant org so I'd really like
00:38 - to thank brilliant for sponsoring this
00:40 - series and it would be great if you all
00:41 - can check them out using the link in the
00:43 - description section below and support
00:44 - the sponsors and I'll talk more about
00:46 - their services in just a bit so with
00:48 - that said let's go ahead and get started
00:50 - so first I'm going to go over a very
00:52 - basic example to see how this works and
00:54 - then we'll look at some more real world
00:56 - data where we plot popular programming
00:58 - languages using a pie chart so I have a
01:01 - little bit of starting code here that
01:02 - you might recognize if you're continuing
01:04 - from the previous videos but if you're
01:06 - not then let me quickly go over the
01:08 - starting code that we have here so I'm
01:10 - simply importing pipe lot from
01:12 - matplotlib we are setting the style to
01:15 - be 538 just so that this looks a little
01:17 - nicer and currently all we have is a
01:19 - title of my awesome pie chart and we are
01:23 - making the tight layout which will get
01:25 - some default padding in there that looks
01:27 - nice and then we are doing plot dot show
01:29 - which will actually show our plot for us
01:32 - and I've also got some colors commented
01:33 - out down here but we don't have to worry
01:36 - about that right now now this code will
01:38 - be available for download I have a link
01:40 - in the description section below that
01:41 - takes you to my github so if you want to
01:43 - follow along then you can download this
01:45 - code and follow along okay so like I
01:47 - said pie charts are pretty simple and
01:49 - straightforward so first of all we need
01:51 - the values that we want to represent in
01:53 - our pie chart and again we can think of
01:56 - these as slices of the pie so for
01:58 - example let's start off easy and say I
02:00 - wanted to just represent two numbers in
02:02 - a pie chart so I'm gonna say slices is
02:05 - equal to and this will be a list so I'll
02:07 - do a list of 60 and 40 and that's
02:10 - actually all we need to create a very
02:12 - basic pie chart
02:13 - so to plot that I can just say PLT dot
02:17 - pie not plot sorry PLT
02:19 - dot pie and we want to make a pie chart
02:22 - of those slices so if I run that then we
02:25 - can see that it plots out our values of
02:27 - 60 and 40 and the 60 value takes up 60%
02:31 - of our plot and the 40 value takes up
02:34 - 40% of the plot but this isn't very
02:37 - useful right now since we don't have any
02:38 - labels or any indication of what we're
02:41 - plotting so let's add some of that so
02:43 - I'm going to go back to the code here
02:44 - okay so we have our slices but let's
02:47 - also add labels for our slices so that
02:49 - we know what's what when we look at our
02:51 - chart so to do this we can just add
02:53 - labels as a list and these will
02:55 - correspond to the slices that we want
02:57 - them to be a label for so underneath the
03:00 - slices here if I was to say labels is
03:03 - equal to and I'll just pass in a list
03:06 - here so the first one I want to label as
03:08 - 60 the second one I want to label as 40
03:11 - and then we can add those labels to our
03:14 - pie chart simply by saying labels is
03:18 - equal to that labels variable that we
03:21 - just created and also just a quick side
03:23 - note our values actually don't need to
03:25 - add up to a hundred percent they can be
03:27 - anything and the pie chart will
03:29 - calculate their proportions accordingly
03:30 - so if I were to double these values then
03:33 - we'd still get a chart that looks the
03:35 - same so if I was to double this to 120
03:38 - and double this to 80 then those are
03:41 - still going to take up the same
03:42 - proportions of the pie chart so if I run
03:44 - that then we can see that our 120 here
03:47 - takes up 60% and that's labeled 60 and
03:49 - our 80 here still takes up 40% and
03:52 - that's labeled 40 now I don't know about
03:54 - you but I like to have some separators
03:56 - on the edges here of these colors
03:58 - instead of these colors just bumping up
04:00 - against each other so to do this we can
04:02 - pass in some wedge properties so back in
04:05 - our code after labels this is going to
04:08 - be in the pie method we can say wedge
04:11 - props for wedge properties and this is
04:14 - going to be a dictionary of values and
04:15 - we just want to change the edge color so
04:18 - I'm going to type in edge color and
04:19 - let's just set that to black so if I run
04:22 - that then now we can see that we have a
04:25 - black edge when
04:26 - for these were just a solid color here
04:29 - now if you're wondering how I knew to
04:31 - change the edge color property there for
04:34 - that wedge property that's something
04:36 - that I looked up in the documentation
04:38 - and if you google matplotlib wedge then
04:41 - it'll take you to their documentation
04:42 - page with all of the customizations that
04:44 - you can make okay so lastly let's look
04:47 - at how we can specify our own colors for
04:49 - these slices and after we do that then
04:51 - we'll take a look at a more real-world
04:53 - example where we create a plot for
04:55 - popular programming languages so to
04:57 - change the colors of these slices we can
04:59 - do the same thing that we did with the
05:01 - labels and just create a new list
05:03 - corresponding with the colors that we
05:05 - want for each slice so I'll just add a
05:08 - few extra colors here and also let me
05:11 - add a few extra slices so I'm going to
05:14 - pass in 30 and 20 here and then I will
05:18 - also pass in labels for these so just
05:20 - extra one and extra two now these aren't
05:24 - going to take up sixty-forty anymore but
05:26 - that's okay we're just doing a
05:27 - demonstration here and now we want to
05:29 - pass in a list of corresponding colors
05:31 - so I'll pass in let's see blue red it's
05:35 - also do yellow and we'll do green as the
05:39 - last color there and now we can pass
05:42 - those colors into our chart by passing
05:45 - those in to the pie method here so right
05:47 - after the labels I'll pass sanic colors
05:49 - is equal to and we called that list
05:51 - colors so I'll save that and now if we
05:55 - run that then we can see that we have
05:57 - more slices here all of these are
05:59 - labeled and we have some custom colors
06:01 - now I almost never use just the color
06:03 - names like we did here because I think
06:06 - that looks kind of like something you'd
06:08 - see in an elementary school textbook or
06:10 - something like that I just think it's
06:11 - kind of bright so you also have options
06:14 - of using hex color values to select your
06:16 - colors as well and I almost always use
06:18 - hex values to get the exact color that I
06:21 - want or I'll let matplotlib styles
06:23 - choose default colors for me but that's
06:25 - why I have these colors commented out
06:27 - down here in my code because I'd like to
06:30 - use those for this example instead so
06:32 - instead if I were to copy all of these
06:36 - here let me grab all of these and I'm
06:38 - just going to paste these in
06:39 - as my colors so now we have that blue
06:44 - color this is a blue hex color this is a
06:46 - hex red color a hex yellow and a hex
06:49 - green and I just found these on a color
06:51 - palette online that I thought looked
06:53 - good so if I run this then we can see
06:56 - that now those colors are a bit more
06:58 - muted and I think that looks a lot more
06:59 - professional than using those built-in
07:01 - named colors okay so now that we've gone
07:03 - over the basics of pie charts now let's
07:06 - look at a real world example and plot
07:07 - popular programming languages now I hope
07:10 - they have these available here in a
07:12 - snippets file that I have open they are
07:14 - let me delete those color comments right
07:16 - now so that we can see everything so in
07:19 - my snippets here and I'm gonna have this
07:20 - available in the description section
07:23 - below as well if you want to go along
07:24 - with these snippets but I'm gonna copy
07:26 - and paste all of these and then I'll
07:28 - explain what this data is and I'm just
07:31 - gonna paste this over top of our custom
07:33 - colors here and also our slices and
07:35 - labels so if I save that now that we
07:38 - don't have those custom colors I'm also
07:39 - going to have to remove colors from the
07:42 - pie method here since we're no longer
07:44 - using that and now let me explain this
07:47 - data here so I grab this data from the
07:49 - 20-19 stackoverflow developer survey and
07:51 - these slices here represent how many
07:54 - respondents said that they use a
07:56 - particular language and the labels here
07:59 - are the language that they said that
08:01 - they knew so the first value of 59,000
08:04 - here is how many people said they knew
08:06 - JavaScript and 55,000 is how many people
08:09 - said they knew HTML and CSS and so on
08:12 - now we've got a lot of languages here
08:14 - these are the top 15 there were around
08:16 - 30 languages here before before we
08:19 - narrowed this down a bit so this is one
08:21 - mistake that I see sometimes when people
08:23 - are creating pie charts pie charts don't
08:26 - really look good when you have this much
08:28 - data they're really best for comparing
08:30 - you know five things or something like
08:32 - that so let's see what this looks like
08:34 - if we run this with all 15 of these
08:37 - values so we can see here that this just
08:40 - gets extremely crowded and it might take
08:42 - us some time to find out exactly what we
08:45 - are looking for and it's also hard to
08:47 - get a good comparison from language to
08:48 - language like if we were to try to
08:50 - compare SQL to JavaScript here
08:53 - then it looks like JavaScript has a
08:55 - larger chunk here but it's really hard
08:57 - to tell by how much because there's so
08:59 - much data so if you wanted to plot this
09:02 - many items then I would definitely
09:03 - recommend using a bar chart like we used
09:06 - in the last video instead of a pie chart
09:08 - I wouldn't use a pie chart unless you
09:10 - have you know I wouldn't use a pie chart
09:13 - if you have more than five items but if
09:15 - you have less than five items then I
09:16 - think a part by chart would work fine
09:19 - so with that said let's strip down our
09:21 - data to only include the top five
09:23 - programming languages so I'm gonna go
09:25 - back to our code here and now I'm just
09:27 - going to delete all of these up until
09:30 - the fifth item so one two three four
09:31 - five so Java is the fifth and then I
09:35 - will delete all the way up until the
09:37 - fifth item here so 1 2 3 4 5 ok ok so
09:41 - now if we run this then we can see that
09:44 - that looks a lot better than all of that
09:46 - clutter that we had before ok so now
09:49 - let's see a few more things that we can
09:51 - do with this pie chart so a lot of the
09:53 - times you'll see some pie charts that
09:55 - have an emphasis on one piece of the
09:56 - chart so for example let's say that I
10:00 - that we were preparing a talk for a
10:02 - Python conference and we wanted to
10:03 - emphasize the Python slice on this chart
10:06 - so to do this we can pass in an explode
10:09 - argument and this will be a list of
10:11 - values that will offset the slice so to
10:14 - do this I'm going to create a an explode
10:18 - list here underneath our labels we'll
10:21 - set that to an empty list ok and these
10:23 - values will represent will be a list of
10:27 - floats which represent how much we want
10:30 - to emphasize that slice so a zero will
10:33 - keep that slice how it is and any number
10:36 - besides zero will represent the fraction
10:38 - of the radius that we'd like to explode
10:41 - the value now that might not make sense
10:43 - right now but let's go ahead and take a
10:46 - look at an example here and I think
10:47 - it'll make more sense so if we want to
10:49 - explode Python that is the fourth item
10:52 - of this list so I'm just going to say 0
10:55 - 0 0 and now on Python I'll just say zero
10:59 - point one and that will put 0 for Java
11:02 - as well and now we can add explode here
11:06 - to our
11:07 - arguments so I'm going to say explode is
11:09 - equal to that explode list okay so now
11:12 - if I run this then we can see here that
11:15 - Python is now exploded out here a little
11:18 - bit and we have some emphasis on a
11:20 - Python here now that point one that we
11:23 - passed in to that explode whenever I
11:25 - said that represents how far it is from
11:27 - the radius that point one just means
11:30 - that it is ten percent of the radius
11:33 - exploded out here if we were to do like
11:35 - a point five then that would be really
11:37 - big and that would be half of the radius
11:39 - that it is exploded out so I'll do a
11:42 - point five and run that and we can see
11:44 - that now it's exploded out by half of
11:46 - the radius the point here is that half
11:48 - but I think that's way too large so
11:50 - let's go back to point one I think point
11:53 - one looks pretty good so let me close
11:56 - both of those down okay so there are a
11:58 - few more arguments that we can pass into
12:00 - our PI method that you might find useful
12:02 - so let's take a look at some of these
12:04 - now one of these is just for aesthetics
12:06 - but we can add a shadow to our chart by
12:09 - passing in an argument of shadow equals
12:11 - true so right after explode here I'll
12:13 - just say shadow equals true and if we
12:18 - run that then we can see that now this
12:20 - looks a little 3d here we have a little
12:23 - shadow along the edges along our slice
12:27 - that's exploded out here just kind of
12:29 - makes it pop out a little bit now
12:31 - another argument that we can pass in is
12:32 - the starting angle and if you want to
12:34 - change exactly how the chart is rotated
12:36 - then you can play around with this so
12:38 - for example if I was to say start angle
12:42 - is equal to let's say 90 degrees so I
12:45 - will save that and run it and now we can
12:49 - see that this chart was rotated a little
12:51 - bit I think it picks an arbitrary angle
12:53 - to plot at first but when we set this
12:56 - equal to 90 we can see that now our
12:59 - first value of JavaScript here starts at
13:02 - a 90-degree angle here and then this
13:04 - goes all the way around to the last item
13:06 - in our list here which is Java so if we
13:09 - really wanted to emphasize Python then
13:11 - we could play around with that angle and
13:12 - get it to show up exactly how we like so
13:15 - that's what start angle does okay and
13:17 - lastly if we want to actually display
13:19 - the percentage that
13:20 - slice is taking up in our pie chart then
13:23 - we can add in an argument for that as
13:25 - well now this syntax is going to look a
13:27 - little strange I always need to look
13:29 - this up in the documentation when I do
13:31 - this but to do this we can say let me
13:34 - actually go on a new line here so to do
13:38 - this we can say Auto PCT so Auto push
13:42 - percent is equal to and now we're
13:45 - passing in a format string here so this
13:47 - is going to be a % one point one f
13:50 - percent whoops percent % and again I
13:54 - know that syntax looks a little bit
13:55 - strange there but that is the format
13:58 - string for how we specify a percentage
14:00 - so if I save that and run it whoops and
14:03 - I forgot my comma there so we had a
14:05 - syntax error if I save that and run it
14:07 - then now we can see that we have the
14:11 - percentages here within our pie chart
14:12 - telling us how big of a piece of the pie
14:16 - each of these values takes up so that's
14:18 - pretty much the basics of a pie chart
14:20 - they're really nice for just getting a
14:22 - quick overview of the data like this and
14:24 - what values take up what percentage of
14:26 - the whole but like I said if you have
14:28 - more values than 5 then I would
14:30 - recommend using a horizontal bar chart
14:33 - or any or a vertical bar chart depending
14:35 - on your data but the pie chart is
14:37 - definitely an option that you have okay
14:40 - so we're just about finished up here but
14:42 - before we end I'd like to also mention
14:43 - the sponsor of this video and that is
14:45 - brilliant org so in this series we've
14:48 - been learning about matplotlib and how
14:50 - to plot data in python and brilliant
14:52 - would be an excellent way to supplement
14:54 - what you learn here with their hands-on
14:55 - courses they have some excellent courses
14:57 - covering the fundamentals of statistics
14:59 - and these lessons do a deep dive on how
15:02 - to think about and analyze data
15:03 - correctly they even use Python in their
15:05 - statistics courses and will quiz you on
15:08 - how to correctly analyze the data within
15:09 - the language they're guided lessons will
15:11 - challenge you but you also have the
15:13 - ability to get hints or even solutions
15:15 - if you need them it's really tailored
15:17 - towards understanding the material
15:19 - they've also recently released a
15:20 - programming with Python course and they
15:22 - even have a coding environment built
15:24 - into their website so that you can run
15:26 - code directly in the browser and that is
15:28 - a great way to complement watching my
15:30 - tutorials because you can apply what
15:32 - you've learned in there
15:33 - of problem-solving environment and that
15:35 - helps to solidify that knowledge so to
15:37 - support my channel and learn more about
15:39 - brilliant you can go to brilliant org
15:41 - Forge / CMS to sign up for free and also
15:44 - the first 200 people that go to that

15:51 - in the description section below
15:52 - again that's brilliant dot org forge
15:55 - slash C m/s okay so I think that pretty
15:59 - much covers it for pie charts I hope you
16:01 - feel like you got a good understanding
16:01 - of when you might use these and also how
16:04 - to customize these a bit to visualize
16:06 - your data exactly how you'd like and in
16:08 - the next video we're going to be
16:10 - covering stacked plots and some people
16:12 - call these area charts it's very similar
16:14 - to a pie chart but instead of looking at
16:17 - how things are proportioned at a single
16:18 - time stack plots will allow us to see
16:21 - these different proportions over time so
16:24 - definitely be sure to check that out but
16:26 - if anyone has any questions about what
16:27 - we covered in this video then feel free
16:29 - to ask in the comments section below and
16:30 - I'll do my best to answer those and if
16:32 - you enjoy these tutorials and would like
16:33 - to support them then there are several
