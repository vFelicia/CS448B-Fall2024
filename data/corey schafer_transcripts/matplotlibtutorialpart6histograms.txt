00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - how to plot histograms so histograms are
00:05 - great for visualizing the distribution
00:07 - of data where the data falls within
00:09 - certain boundaries it's a lot like a bar
00:11 - graph but a histogram groups the data up
00:13 - into bins instead of plotting each
00:16 - individual value so the best way to see
00:18 - what this looks like is to just take a
00:19 - look at some examples now I would like
00:22 - to mention that we do have a sponsor for
00:23 - the series of videos and that is
00:25 - brilliant dot work so I really want to
00:27 - thank brilliant we're sponsoring this
00:28 - series and it would be great if you all
00:30 - could check them out using the link in
00:31 - the description section below and
00:33 - support the sponsors and I'll talk more
00:34 - about their services and just a bit so
00:37 - with that said let's go ahead and get
00:38 - started so I have a little starting code
00:40 - here that you might recognize if you're
00:42 - continuing from previous videos but if
00:44 - you're not then let me give a quick
00:46 - overview of the code here and what's
00:48 - what's going on ok so up here at the top
00:50 - of the code I am importing pandas I'm
00:52 - also importing pipe lot from matplotlib
00:55 - I'm using the 538 style
00:58 - 4 just to make our plots look a little
01:01 - nicer and here is the data that I'm
01:04 - going to be using for this video right
01:06 - now I just have a list of ages here
01:07 - between 18 and 55 I here's some data
01:10 - that I have commented out in a CSV file
01:12 - and we'll look at this once we get
01:14 - further along in the video and see how
01:16 - to plot out more data than just this
01:18 - small list ok so down here at the bottom
01:21 - we are also creating a title for our
01:23 - plot we have X and y axis labels we have
01:27 - a tight layout which just gives our plot
01:31 - some padding and also we are doing plot
01:34 - dot show which will actually show our
01:35 - plot now as usual if you'd like to
01:37 - follow along then I will have this code
01:39 - available on my github and there's a
01:41 - link to that and it's description
01:42 - section below if you want to go there
01:44 - and copy and paste this into your editor
01:46 - so that you can follow along with this
01:47 - exact data and I'm also going to have
01:49 - the data CSV file that I'm using in this
01:52 - video as well ok so like I was saying
01:54 - we're first gonna look at how to do this
01:55 - using this list of data directly here in
01:59 - the Python script and then we'll look at
02:01 - a real word example with data that I'll
02:03 - load in from a CSV file so first let's
02:06 - look at this small list of sample data
02:08 - so let's pretend that we took a survey
02:10 - and we track the ages of all the people
02:13 - who respond
02:13 - now it might be useful to plot those
02:15 - ages to get an idea of which age groups
02:18 - are in our sample size so how should we
02:21 - actually plot these well off the top of
02:23 - your head you might think that a bar
02:24 - chart would be a good idea for this but
02:27 - if you think about it we possibly have
02:29 - up to a hundred different possible ages
02:32 - maybe even more so if you plot it out
02:35 - how many responses we got from each age
02:37 - then that would mean you'd have almost a
02:39 - hundred different columns which
02:41 - definitely isn't useful
02:42 - so this is where histograms come in
02:44 - histograms allow us to create bins for
02:47 - our data and plot how many values fall
02:50 - into those bins so to see this let's
02:53 - create a histogram of this list of ages
02:55 - that we have here so to do this I can
02:58 - simply say BLT dot hist and we will plot
03:03 - out those ages now if I ran this now
03:07 - then it would give us a plot but really
03:10 - we wouldn't know what bins it's actually
03:12 - using so I always like to pass those in
03:14 - manually and explicitly so that people
03:17 - know what those bins are so when we
03:19 - specify bins we can either pass in an
03:22 - integer or a list of values if we pass
03:25 - in an integer then it will just may make
03:28 - that number of bins and divide our data
03:30 - into those accordingly so for example if
03:33 - I was to say bins is equal to 5 then
03:36 - this will divide all of these ages up
03:39 - into 5 different bins and then tell us
03:41 - how many people fell into those age
03:43 - ranges so if we run this then we can see
03:47 - that we get a pretty simple histogram
03:49 - here and what this is is a distribution
03:52 - here now I personally find it a bit
03:54 - difficult to read these sometimes if we
03:56 - don't have edge colors for each bin
03:58 - because they all just kind of run
04:00 - together here so I don't know exactly
04:02 - how many bins there are here and here
04:05 - I'm a guessing since we have five bins
04:06 - it's two bins here and three bins here
04:08 - but let's add in some edge color so
04:10 - that's more clear so we can add those in
04:13 - by going back to our plot here and I'm
04:15 - just going to pass that as an argument
04:17 - so edge color is equal to I'll just say
04:20 - black so now let's run this and now we
04:23 - can see those bins a bit more clearly so
04:26 - let me
04:27 - make this a little larger and also to
04:29 - where you can see the ages up here at
04:31 - the top and let me explain what this is
04:33 - actually doing so we said that we wanted
04:35 - our data plotted on a histogram and we
04:38 - wanted that broken up into five
04:39 - different bins so it calculated those
04:42 - ages for us so this looks like it's
04:44 - between let's see 18 and like 26 maybe
04:48 - and then 26 to 33 and so on but what
04:53 - this is telling us here is that there
04:55 - are four people in our ages here that
04:58 - fall between 18 to 26 and there are four
05:02 - people that fall between 26 to 33 and so
05:05 - on and then we just have one person in
05:08 - these higher age ranges for each of
05:10 - those bins so if you pass in an integer
05:12 - for our bins then that's what we get but
05:15 - we can also pass in our own list of
05:17 - values and those values will be the bins
05:20 - and I like passing in a list of bins for
05:22 - this kind of data because you have more
05:24 - control over the exact values so for
05:26 - example let's say that I wanted to plot
05:28 - the ages broken up into groups of ten
05:31 - year differences so I could say right
05:34 - here above my plot I'm gonna say bins is
05:37 - equal to and I'm just going to say that
05:40 - we want to bend for 10 20 30 40 50 and
05:44 - 60 and now instead of passing in that we
05:48 - want 5 bins I want to say that I want to
05:51 - use this list as my bins so now if I run
05:54 - this then we can see that we still get
05:57 - five different bins here but that's only
06:01 - because we have six values here in our
06:04 - list so it starts at 10 and then 10 to
06:07 - 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 and 50 to
06:11 - 60 so that is five bins total so if I
06:14 - open this back up now the reason I like
06:17 - using my own bins for this kind of data
06:19 - is because now it doesn't have to try to
06:22 - guess where I want these broken up so we
06:25 - can see that now we have from 10 to 20
06:28 - it's a lot easier to read we don't have
06:29 - to guess it's like 26 or something like
06:31 - that so we're saying from 10 to 22
06:34 - people and our ages list fell into that
06:36 - bin there were 4 people from 20 to 30
06:40 - three from 30 to 40 one from 40 to 50
06:43 - and one from 50 to 60 so that's how you
06:45 - plot and read a histogram and we can
06:48 - even exclude some data if we don't want
06:51 - to add those ranges to our bins so for
06:54 - example let's say that we didn't want to
06:57 - include the ages between 10 to 20 in my
07:00 - results well to do that we can just
07:02 - simply remove 10 from the bin and now 20
07:06 - will be that leftmost value so now if we
07:09 - run this then now we can see that it's
07:12 - not even plotting out the ages from 10
07:15 - to 20 there so this 19 and 20 don't even
07:17 - show up in our results here so this is
07:20 - now just giving us our results for the
07:22 - people who fell into these age ranges
07:24 - between 20 and 60 okay so now that we've
07:27 - looked at this small example now let's
07:29 - look at a real world example looking at
07:32 - some real data so let me uncomment what
07:35 - I've got here let me remove ages here so
07:40 - I'm just going to remove that data that
07:43 - is directly in our Python script now I'm
07:46 - going to uncomment out the data that I
07:47 - had down here let me cut that out and
07:50 - paste it here above our bins and our
07:55 - plot okay so I'm loading in this data is
07:58 - V file and I'm using this Panda stop
08:01 - read CSV method to do this now we've
08:03 - done this a few times so far in the
08:05 - series but if this is your first video
08:07 - that you are watching in the series then
08:08 - let me explain this really quick so we
08:11 - are loading in this data CSV so what
08:14 - this does is it goes to this see data
08:16 - CSV file here so let me explain what
08:19 - this survey data is so we have these
08:22 - responder IDs and this is just an ID for
08:24 - each person who responded to the survey
08:26 - so this is one person here this is
08:29 - another person here another person here
08:30 - and then our age column here is just the
08:33 - age for the people who responded to this
08:35 - survey so this person was 14 this person
08:37 - was nineteen twenty eight twenty two and
08:39 - so on so back here we have our IDs
08:43 - variable and we're setting that equal to
08:45 - data and then we are passing in this
08:48 - responder ID key so what that does is it
08:51 - sets those IDs equal to all of
08:53 - these IDs here that are in this
08:55 - responder ID column and here we're
08:58 - saying ages is equal to data age and
09:00 - that is setting that ages variable
09:03 - they're equal to this entire column here
09:05 - for our ages and the data that I'm using
09:08 - here are the responses from the 2019
09:11 - stackoverflow developer survey so this
09:14 - is actually real data for people who
09:16 - answered that survey so we have let's
09:18 - see over 79,000 responses here in this
09:23 - data csv file okay so let's plot a
09:26 - histogram of the ages for this data set
09:28 - and see what age ranges most people fall
09:31 - into who answered this survey so I'm
09:33 - going to expand the bins here a bit and
09:36 - I'm gonna say 10 20 30 40 50 60 we'll
09:40 - also cover 70 80 whoops 80 90 and let's
09:45 - also put in a hundred there now since we
09:47 - called this ages variable here the same
09:49 - thing that we had before we don't even
09:51 - need to change our histogram plot
09:53 - because that is still just ages there so
09:56 - now I should be able to run this and get
09:58 - some real data here from this or some
10:01 - results here from that data so we can
10:04 - see here that based on this plot that
10:06 - almost 40,000 of the respondents were
10:09 - between the ages of 20 and 30 and almost
10:13 - 25 thousand were between the ages of 30
10:16 - and 40 now it might not look like we
10:19 - have data for 70 to 80 and 80 to 90 but
10:23 - it's likely because there just weren't
10:25 - many responses with those ages and
10:27 - compared to 40,000 responses for the 20
10:30 - to 30 group it's just too small to show
10:32 - up but I bet if I was to zoom in on
10:35 - these values here then we will start to
10:37 - see something okay so here's 70 to 80 if
10:40 - i zoom in here then we can see 80 to 83
10:43 - so there are some responses there but
10:46 - they're just being dwarfed by these
10:48 - numbers over here now when you have
10:50 - certain values that are a lot more than
10:51 - your other values then you can plot this
10:54 - on a logarithmic scale to montón to not
10:57 - make this look so extreme so to do this
10:59 - we can add an argument of log equals
11:03 - true to our plot so within our hist
11:06 - method
11:07 - I'm just gonna say log is equal to true
11:10 - and now if I run this then this is
11:13 - plotting this on a logarithmic scale and
11:15 - we can see that now we do have that data
11:18 - visible for 70 to 80 80 to 90 and 90 to
11:21 - 100 so we actually had more people who
11:24 - responded to the survey that they were
11:26 - between the ages of 90 to 100 than the
11:29 - people who were between 80 and 90 so I
11:31 - think that's kind of interesting there
11:33 - now sometimes you might find it useful
11:36 - to add some additional information
11:38 - within these plots as well so for
11:41 - example let's just leave the histogram
11:43 - how we have it for now but let's say
11:46 - that we want to plot a vertical line
11:47 - where the median age of all the
11:50 - respondents is and I've got this
11:52 - commented out down here at the bottom
11:55 - here so let me uncomment out this median
11:58 - age and also I'm going to uncomment this
12:00 - color and this legend as well so I went
12:03 - through and I calculated the median age
12:05 - of all of the respondents and it was 29
12:08 - years old so now let's plot a vertical
12:11 - line on our existing plot with that age
12:14 - so to do that just above our legend here
12:18 - I'm going to say PLT dot ax V line so
12:23 - I'm pretty sure that is stands for axis
12:25 - vertical line and we want that line to
12:28 - be plotted at the median age and now
12:32 - let's also I want to add in a color here
12:35 - and the custom color I'm going to add as
12:38 - this I think this is just a red color
12:40 - that I grabbed and also let's put in a
12:42 - label so that we know what this line
12:44 - represents and I'm just going to say age
12:46 - median so now let's run this and now we
12:50 - can see that within our histogram we now
12:52 - have this vertical line here which is
12:55 - the age median so this plot tells us a
12:58 - lot of things it tells us how many
13:00 - people are falling within which age
13:02 - groups who answered the survey and also
13:05 - where the median is for those survey
13:07 - results and if you think that this line
13:09 - is a little bit thick and kind of
13:10 - obstructing the data anyway then you can
13:12 - play around with how this looks so for
13:15 - example if you wanted to change the
13:16 - thickness there instead we could say
13:18 - line width is
13:19 - equal to two if I run that then that's a
13:23 - little thinner there so that's basically
13:26 - what these histogram plots are used for
13:29 - we can use these for dropping our data
13:32 - into these different bins and see how
13:35 - many values fall into these certain bins
13:37 - so that's what you would use a histogram
13:38 - for okay so we are just about finished
13:40 - up here but before we end I'd like to
13:43 - mention the sponsor of this video and
13:44 - that is brilliant org brilliant is a
13:47 - problem-solving website that helps you
13:49 - understand underlying concepts by
13:51 - actively working through guided lessons
13:53 - they have computer science courses
13:54 - ranging from algorithms and data
13:56 - structures to machine learning and
13:58 - neural networks they even have a coding
13:59 - environment built into their website so
14:01 - that you can run code directly in the
14:03 - browser and that's a great way to
14:04 - complement watching my tutorials because
14:06 - you can apply what you've learned and
14:08 - their active problem-solving environment
14:09 - and that helps to solidify that
14:11 - knowledge there are guided lessons will
14:13 - challenge you but you also have the
14:14 - ability to get hints or even solutions
14:16 - if you need them it's really tailored
14:18 - towards understanding that material so
14:19 - they're computer science material is
14:21 - fantastic and I really like what they're
14:23 - doing they also have plenty of courses
14:25 - depending on what you're most interested
14:26 - in so they have courses in different
14:28 - fields of mathematics or astronomy solar
14:31 - energy computational biology and all
14:34 - kinds of other great content so to

14:50 - description section below
14:51 - and again that's brilliant org /c m/s
14:55 - okay so I think that is going to do it
14:57 - for this video I hope you feel like you
14:59 - got a good understanding of how to use
15:01 - histograms and also when it might be
15:02 - appropriate for different kinds of
15:04 - datasets
15:05 - these are definitely nice when we have
15:07 - data like we did in this video where we
15:09 - want to divide those ages up into
15:12 - different bins and get an idea of those
15:14 - age distributions because like I was
15:16 - saying before you might be tempted to
15:18 - use a bar plot but when you have a
15:20 - hundred ages like this that means that
15:22 - we're going to have a hundred little
15:24 - bars and sometimes that just doesn't
15:25 - tell you the information that you're
15:27 - looking for and these histograms are
15:30 - better suited for that now in the next
15:32 - video we're going to be learning about
15:33 - Scott
15:33 - plots so scatter plots are great when we
15:35 - want to show the relationship between
15:37 - two sets of values and see how they're
15:39 - correlated so for example let's say that
15:41 - we wanted to see how salaries were
15:43 - correlated with age or something like
15:45 - that well we would probably assume that
15:48 - on average we'd see higher salaries with
15:51 - higher ages but to be sure we can plot
15:54 - that with a scatterplot and see what
15:56 - that data looks like so definitely be
15:58 - sure to check out that video but if
15:59 - anyone has any questions about what we
