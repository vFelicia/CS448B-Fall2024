00:00 - hey how's it going guys i wanted to make
00:02 - a quick video here
00:03 - and show you a neat trick that you can
00:04 - add to your css files
00:06 - when making your print style sheets if
00:09 - you don't know what a print style sheet
00:10 - is
00:11 - pretty much it is a media query but
00:14 - instead of being a media query
00:16 - for screen sizes it's a media query for
00:19 - what your page looks like when someone
00:21 - prints it out
00:23 - the reason that you would want something
00:25 - like this is
00:27 - if i have a test website running on my
00:30 - local server over here
00:31 - um if someone printed out this page
00:33 - there's a lot of information here that
00:35 - they
00:36 - wouldn't care to see uh when printed out
00:38 - like this navigation menu here
00:40 - uh this sidebar with featured posts and
00:43 - things like that
00:44 - and also anything that you might have in
00:46 - a footer area with
00:48 - you know things like this it's all would
00:50 - just be junk when printed out
00:51 - you really just want to focus uh solely
00:54 - on the content
00:56 - so whenever i print this test page here
01:00 - you can see that my print style sheet
01:02 - has removed the navigation menu here
01:04 - it has centered the site logo taken out
01:08 - this sidebar
01:09 - and also removed all the footer
01:12 - information here that was getting in the
01:13 - way
01:15 - so what i wanted to show you guys was a
01:18 - lot of people suggest
01:20 - that it's a best practice to add in
01:24 - the urls of links into your
01:27 - print style sheet and the reason that
01:29 - they suggest doing this
01:31 - is if i zoom in here if you look at this
01:34 - resources section that i added here to
01:36 - the bottom of this article
01:38 - then if someone printed this out and
01:41 - it's just on paper
01:42 - they may be curious as to where these
01:45 - links actually go
01:46 - and if you add the url onto the page
01:50 - then they'll be able to uh you know type
01:53 - those urls in themselves
01:55 - and don't have to go back to your
01:56 - website and refine that article again
01:59 - so i'm going to show you a few different
02:01 - ways to do this and
02:02 - ultimately how i ended up doing it on
02:05 - my website now the easiest way we can do
02:08 - this
02:09 - is to just target every anchor tag on
02:12 - the page
02:13 - that has an href attribute and the way
02:15 - we do that
02:16 - is we would just search for our anchors
02:18 - with
02:19 - and whenever i open up this brackets now
02:21 - it means that we're now searching for
02:22 - attributes
02:23 - and type in href so any anchor tag that
02:27 - has an attribute
02:28 - with an href and then we'll put in
02:32 - this after tag and we want
02:35 - this content after
02:39 - the anchors with hrefs to be
02:42 - and i'm just going to put hard code in a
02:44 - parenthesis here and then
02:46 - after i close off this quote
02:50 - then i'm going to put in attribute
02:53 - href and then i'm going to hard code in
02:58 - the closing parentheses and then end
03:00 - that with a semicolon
03:01 - and let's save that and let's take a
03:04 - look at what this looks like
03:06 - in our print style sheet so let me
03:07 - reload this
03:10 - and then open up the print preview you
03:12 - can see this
03:13 - isn't exactly what we're looking for if
03:16 - we zoom in here
03:17 - you can see that it prints out every
03:20 - link on the page with an
03:21 - href and that's is what we targeted but
03:24 - you can see that those links include
03:26 - the links and the header here it also
03:29 - includes
03:30 - author information a lot of things that
03:33 - the reader most likely doesn't care
03:35 - about they probably just want to see
03:36 - external links to your website so these
03:40 - are really the only ones that we would
03:41 - want
03:42 - printed out in our print style sheet so
03:45 - let's see if we can do this
03:47 - a little bit better now what some people
03:50 - suggest to do here
03:52 - is to target uh any
03:55 - anchor tags with an href that
03:58 - starts with and this carrot sign equals
04:01 - means that
04:02 - hrefs that start with and then they will
04:05 - type in here
04:06 - http colon
04:09 - and that will target any href that
04:13 - starts with
04:14 - http now this would work great if
04:17 - every internal link on our website was
04:21 - relative but if you hard code in the
04:24 - links
04:25 - with the full web address or if you're
04:27 - using
04:29 - a framework like wordpress or something
04:32 - like that
04:33 - then sometimes those will put in the
04:35 - full web address for you
04:37 - so let me show you what i mean by this
04:39 - if i inspect one of my links over here
04:43 - then you can see within the anchor tag
04:45 - the href
04:46 - even though it's internal to my website
04:49 - it still has the http
04:52 - and this links to localhost because i'm
04:54 - running this on my local web server
04:57 - so this approach really isn't going to
05:00 - work for us this
05:01 - only works if every internal link
05:04 - for your website is relative
05:07 - so what other options do we have here
05:10 - well if i pull up this tab here there is
05:13 - a css selector called
05:15 - not and what not does is it takes
05:19 - a css selector and then it applies
05:21 - styles to everything
05:24 - that is not that selector so
05:27 - it'd be easiest just for me to show you
05:29 - with an example here
05:31 - so in our example with our links
05:34 - right after the anchor tag here if i
05:38 - put in colon not then open up a
05:40 - parenthesis
05:41 - and we want the print parentheses to go
05:43 - around
05:44 - our href here so let's close that there
05:49 - and what this currently says is that we
05:51 - want all links
05:53 - that do not have an href that starts
05:56 - with
05:56 - http and what we want this to be
06:00 - is we don't want any links that start
06:03 - with
06:04 - our internal website here so in this
06:07 - case
06:07 - i'm running this website on a local web
06:10 - server right now
06:11 - so this will be http localhost
06:17 - now if i was on my live website
06:21 - then i would change this domain to
06:24 - whatever my
06:25 - live website url would be so if we save
06:28 - that
06:30 - and then we reload this page over here
06:34 - now if i pull up the print style sheet
06:38 - then you can see that it no longer adds
06:41 - urls
06:43 - into the header or any of these internal
06:45 - links like
06:46 - like this author url leave a comment
06:49 - none of that stuff
06:50 - but if we scroll down here to the bottom
06:52 - then you can see that it does
06:54 - add in the urls uh to these links that i
06:57 - have
06:58 - to these external links here that i have
07:00 - listed in
07:01 - the resources and that's exactly what we
07:04 - wanted so let me
07:05 - go ahead and zoom in there so you guys
07:07 - can read so yeah that's exactly what we
07:10 - were hoping for
07:12 - so this is the best way that i've found
07:14 - that i can remove internal links
07:16 - from my css print style sheets
07:20 - so i hope this was useful for you guys
07:23 - if you guys have any
07:24 - questions or if you know any alternate
07:26 - ways of doing this
07:28 - then go ahead and leave those in the
07:30 - comments below

07:35 - tutorials
