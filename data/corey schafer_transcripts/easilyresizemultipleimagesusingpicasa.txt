00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to
00:04 - resize multiple images all at once
00:07 - really quickly and easily using Google
00:10 - Picasa if you've never used Picasa
00:14 - before and you want to download it you
00:16 - can easily find it over here on the
00:18 - internet it is at
00:21 - picasa.google.com
00:23 - also if
00:25 - using the terminal is more your style I
00:29 - also have a video on how to quickly
00:32 - resize lots of images just using the
00:35 - terminal but in this video we're going
00:37 - to be focusing on using Picasa so this
00:41 - is what Picasa looks like whenever you
00:43 - first open it up what you might see at
00:46 - first is it may ask you what folders you
00:49 - want to connect to Picasa if it doesn't
00:52 - ask you then you can get to that by
00:54 - going up here to tools and then folder
00:57 - manager okay so this might be what you
00:59 - see whenever you first open up Picasa so
01:02 - the folder that we want to connect I
01:04 - have a folder on my desktop and it is
01:07 - this large folder and I will just do
01:09 - scan once and click ok
01:12 - now really quickly on my desktop let me
01:15 - open up this large folder and I'll show
01:16 - you what's in here if I highlight all
01:19 - these pictures and open these up in
01:20 - preview you can see that all these
01:22 - pictures are really large high
01:24 - definition pictures you know if we
01:27 - wanted to put this on a website maybe we
01:29 - would want the large high definition
01:31 - pictures for the detailed View and then
01:34 - maybe we would want some medium to small
01:37 - pictures for maybe like a thumbnail view
01:40 - or something like that so that's one of
01:43 - the reasons that you might want to
01:44 - resize lots of images at once okay so
01:47 - now we have all of these images loaded
01:50 - into Picasa and we can see our folder
01:52 - over here to the left and we have all of
01:54 - our images here so resizing these is
01:57 - super easy all we got to do is highlight
02:00 - all of our images
02:01 - and then come up here to file and then
02:05 - we want to come down here to export
02:08 - picture to folder click on that and now
02:11 - to this export location we're already on
02:14 - our desktop let's go to browse let's go
02:16 - to desktop let's choose the desktop and
02:19 - instead of large let's call this
02:22 - medium
02:23 - and then image size we want to resize to
02:27 - let's go ahead and stick with 640
02:29 - picture pixels that's a good
02:30 - medium-sized picture image quality we'll
02:33 - just keep that automatic and we won't
02:35 - add an add a watermark right now but you
02:37 - can do that if you want to so let's go
02:39 - ahead and click export and you can see
02:41 - down here that it's exporting all the
02:43 - pictures to the desktop
02:45 - and then it'll open up the desktop and
02:47 - finder whenever that finishes up but I'm
02:49 - just going to close this down and then
02:51 - show you that the folder did pop up here
02:54 - on the desktop so if I double click on
02:56 - that then we can see all the images are
02:59 - here I can highlight all these open them
03:02 - up in preview and you can see that they
03:04 - all are
03:06 - 640 pixels so now you know if you wanted
03:10 - we could do this again if you wanted
03:13 - a really small 300 Pixel picture we
03:16 - could do the same thing export instead
03:18 - of large we'll call this small instead
03:21 - of 640
03:22 - call this 300 export that and it's as
03:26 - easy as that it's super fast to resize
03:29 - the pictures this way so close that down
03:32 - and open up our small directory and you
03:36 - know we can
03:37 - open these up and look through those and
03:39 - they are all sized to 300 pixels
03:42 - so if resizing your pictures was all
03:46 - that you wanted and needed to do then at
03:48 - this point you would be done you have
03:50 - your three folders all of your large
03:52 - medium and small pictures
03:54 - one thing additional that you might want
03:57 - to do is rename the photos and there's
04:00 - not so much an easy way to do that but I
04:03 - figured it's kind of outside the scope
04:05 - of this video but I will show you a way
04:07 - to do that anyway I'm just in case you
04:10 - need to do it it's something that a lot
04:12 - of people need to do because once they
04:15 - have their different size photos
04:17 - they want to rename those to the
04:19 - specific size of their image so that
04:23 - they can distinguish between the
04:26 - different sizes maybe on their web
04:27 - server for the website or something like
04:29 - that so over here in my terminal I'm
04:31 - going to a CD into my small directory
04:35 - that is this directory here on my
04:38 - desktop
04:40 - and then I'm just going to go up to this
04:43 - command that I ran earlier
04:46 - so you don't want to run this command
04:49 - unless you know for sure that you're in
04:51 - the correct directory because this will
04:54 - overwrite the names of files so only do
04:57 - this if you're sure 100 that you're in
05:00 - the correct directory and we are here
05:02 - we're in the small directory on the
05:04 - desktop
05:05 - and what this is doing is it's finding
05:09 - within the current directory all the
05:11 - files which in this case it's all JPEG
05:15 - files and then we're going to execute
05:16 - this bash command where we're going to
05:19 - move but pretty much move is the same
05:22 - thing as rename so we're going to rename
05:24 - this file we're going to disregard the
05:27 - extension here Pack 1 size 300 and then
05:31 - also add on the dot JPEG to the end
05:35 - again since we disregarded it earlier so
05:38 - if I hit enter there and then I run an
05:40 - LS command which just lists all the
05:42 - files into directory now you can see
05:45 - that all of our small images now have
05:47 - this 300 packed onto the end of the
05:50 - image name before these were just the
05:54 - same names as the large and medium size
05:57 - images and now they have this Dash 300
05:59 - on the end to distinguish that they are
06:02 - 300 pixels wide well that about does it
06:05 - for this video like I said if you'd like
06:08 - to see another video on how to do this
06:10 - image resizing within the terminal I do
06:12 - have a video on that and I will put the
06:14 - link in the description below but other
06:17 - than that I hope that this video was
06:19 - useful for you guys if you have any
