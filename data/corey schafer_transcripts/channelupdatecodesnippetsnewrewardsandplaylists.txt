00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video I just wanted to check in and
00:03 - give everyone some updates about the
00:05 - channel I'm always getting suggestions
00:07 - from a lot of you about some
00:08 - improvements that you'd like to see a
00:10 - lot of the suggestions that I get have
00:11 - to do with providing the code Snippets
00:13 - and source code from my videos and also
00:16 - some ideas for how I organize my videos
00:18 - so I've been working on getting some of
00:20 - those improvements in place and we'll
00:22 - discuss all of that here in just a bit
00:24 - um also in this video I have a couple of
00:26 - questions for you all and would love any
00:28 - feedback that you can provide in the
00:30 - comments or messages so first of all I
00:32 - just wanted to give a big thank you to
00:33 - all of you we recently hit 30,000
00:35 - subscribers on the channel and I'm
00:37 - getting more and more messages and
00:38 - feedback every day I can't always
00:40 - respond to every message and question
00:42 - that I receive but I just want you all
00:44 - to know that I do read every one of them
00:46 - and really appreciate all the feedback
00:47 - that you send my way and I especially
00:49 - want to thank all the people who are
00:51 - supporting through patreon um now I know
00:54 - that not everyone has the means to
00:55 - support financially and that's totally
00:57 - understandable but for those of you who
00:58 - do I just want you to know that I really
01:00 - appreciate it um at some point I would
01:02 - love to make these tutorials full-time
01:04 - so that I could put out a ton more
01:06 - in-depth videos at a faster pace and
01:08 - every bit of support makes that more and
01:10 - more of a possibility and speaking of
01:12 - patreon I recently updated the rewards
01:14 - that I offer so if you're not familiar
01:16 - with patreon it's basically a way for
01:19 - people to financially support creators
01:21 - for as little as a dollar a month and
01:23 - they also have a feature where you can
01:24 - set certain levels so that anyone who
01:27 - donates a certain amount unlocks some
01:29 - kind of of perk or reward so the reward
01:32 - that I already had in place is that
01:34 - anyone who supports the channel gets a
01:35 - shout out on my personal website and
01:37 - that's over here on my contributions
01:39 - page now that is unless they opted out
01:42 - of that I do have several supporters who
01:43 - chose to opt out of getting that uh now
01:45 - I'm going to continue adding supporters
01:47 - to my contributors page here but I've
01:49 - also wanted to uh do more than just
01:52 - giving a shout out for people who
01:54 - support the channel so I was trying to
01:55 - think of some better rewards that I
01:57 - could offer and you can see that I've
01:59 - updated this over here on the side um so
02:02 - one thing that I was thinking uh was
02:05 - that we could do book giveaways
02:07 - specifically for people who support the
02:08 - channel so I've updated my patreon so
02:10 - that anytime I do a giveaway each
02:12 - supporter will get one entry for every
02:15 - dollar that they contribute and then I
02:17 - will randomly select a winner from those
02:19 - entries so for example someone
02:21 - contributing $10 will receive 10 entries
02:23 - and so on um so I'm probably going to do
02:25 - my first giveaway like this uh at the
02:28 - beginning of next month or so um and
02:30 - another fun thing I was thinking was
02:32 - that I could write my own script to
02:34 - randomly select this winner and I could
02:37 - make a video showing the process for how
02:39 - I go about writing a script like that so
02:41 - that's one question that I had for all
02:42 - of you is uh what do you think of these
02:44 - rewards for patreon supporters because I
02:46 - really do appreciate all of you who
02:48 - support the channel and I want to
02:50 - provide something in return uh so if you
02:52 - have any ideas or feedback then I'm
02:54 - definitely open for suggestions now the
02:56 - only caveat here is that I can't do any
02:58 - reward that's too timec consuming
03:00 - uh because I still do have a full-time
03:02 - job and I'm also answering a lot of
03:03 - viewer questions in my free time so any
03:06 - rewards that I provide will have to be
03:08 - something that doesn't take up too much
03:09 - time uh because any time that I put
03:11 - towards that will take away from the
03:13 - time that I'm able to put into answering
03:15 - questions and making future videos and I
03:18 - know that for the most part uh you all
03:20 - would like to uh see me get out more
03:22 - videos than anything else okay so with
03:24 - that out of the way let's move on to
03:26 - some of the updates here now one of the
03:28 - most common suggestions that I get is
03:30 - that I should be putting up the source
03:32 - code from each of my videos so I've gone
03:34 - back through all of my videos and tried
03:36 - to put all of the code onto my GitHub
03:38 - page um now I've also gone through each
03:40 - video and added links to the source code
03:43 - in the description of each video so this
03:46 - is just one example here if you're
03:47 - looking for the source code then you can
03:49 - look in the comments and there will
03:50 - usually be a link like this the code
03:52 - from this video can be found at and
03:54 - it'll have a link and when you click on
03:56 - that it'll take you over to my GitHub
03:58 - page where I link the source code for
04:00 - those videos so in the future I'm going
04:02 - to make it a habit of pushing the code
04:04 - to my GitHub page before I publish a
04:06 - video and I'll be sure to add those
04:08 - links to the source code in the
04:10 - description of each video so be on the
04:11 - lookout for that okay and another
04:13 - suggestion that I get a lot is that I
04:15 - should create a playlist that orders all
04:18 - of my python videos in such a way where
04:20 - there's some kind of progression and
04:23 - this would be so that uh someone who's
04:24 - learning python can just start at the
04:27 - beginning of the playlist and the videos
04:29 - that I suggest for a beginner will be
04:31 - towards the beginning intermed
04:32 - intermediate videos will be in the
04:34 - middle and more advanced videos will be
04:36 - towards the end so I've created one
04:38 - large python playlist and ordered my
04:40 - videos in such a way that I think it's
04:43 - the uh best for beginners uh or what I
04:46 - think is best for beginners will be
04:48 - towards the beginning and they progress
04:50 - through to the more advanced tutorials
04:53 - now I do want to point out that this
04:54 - doesn't exactly flow like a python class
04:57 - where uh you should watch every single
04:59 - video back to back there are some videos
05:01 - that people will most likely want to
05:03 - skip so for example at the beginning of
05:05 - the playlist I've placed all of the
05:08 - development environment setup videos now
05:10 - I made development environment setup
05:12 - videos for Sublime Text and atom and
05:14 - eclipse and I made setup videos for each
05:17 - of these because different people have
05:18 - different preferences and I wanted to
05:20 - give my preferred setup for each of
05:22 - those but for someone who's getting
05:23 - started with python they might only want
05:25 - to watch one of these videos to get
05:27 - their environment set up and then move
05:29 - on to the next relevant topic they
05:31 - probably don't want to watch all three
05:32 - of these setup videos but with that said
05:35 - I did order these in a way that I think
05:37 - makes sense for someone learning python
05:39 - uh so at the beginning we have our
05:41 - development environment setups and then
05:43 - we move on to you know package
05:45 - management with Pip and creating virtual
05:47 - environments uh learning about scope and
05:50 - so on now this is one large python
05:52 - playlist with every single one of my
05:54 - python videos now for something that
05:56 - does flow more like a class then I have
05:59 - created other uh playlists that flow uh
06:03 - from you know uh from beginning to end
06:05 - just like you'd expect so if someone is
06:08 - only interested in learning how to
06:09 - create classes and objectoriented
06:11 - programming in Python then they can just
06:13 - go straight to this playlist instead and
06:16 - I have created several other playlists
06:18 - that focus on specific topics rather
06:20 - than the large python playlist with
06:22 - everything included um so just give
06:25 - those playlists a look and um and
06:27 - hopefully they're ordered appropriately
06:30 - okay so I think that's going to do it
06:31 - for this video now those are by far the
06:33 - suggestions that I get the most and
06:35 - hopefully now that those are addressed
06:36 - then the videos will be more accessible
06:38 - and easier to follow along than before
06:40 - um now as usual if you have any
06:42 - questions then feel free to ask in the
06:43 - comment section below um feel free to
06:46 - give me suggestions or feedback about
06:48 - anything that we talked about in this
06:49 - update video and again thank you all for
06:52 - everything and thanks for
06:58 - watching
