00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we'll be learning how to
00:02 - install and use the Linux bash shell on
00:04 - Windows 10 so for those of you who have
00:06 - followed along with my videos for some
00:08 - time now you know that I mainly used the
00:10 - Mac OS X operating system and
00:11 - occasionally I'll also do Linux
00:13 - tutorials using either a boon to or Kali
00:15 - Linux and I'm going to continue using
00:17 - those operating systems into the future
00:19 - but I also have a lot of people using
00:20 - Windows machines who contact me and say
00:22 - that they wish they could fall along
00:23 - with my terminal commands while on
00:25 - Windows so for those of you who are on
00:27 - Windows Windows 10 actually now comes
00:30 - with the option to use a Linux bash
00:31 - shell within windows which is really
00:34 - nice and this is a real bash shell this
00:36 - isn't a virtual machine or cygwin or
00:39 - anything like that
00:40 - that I may have suggested in the past so
00:42 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:44 - to use this feature so that you can use
00:46 - the Linux command line within Windows so
00:48 - let's go ahead and get started so first
00:50 - we need to turn this feature on so in
00:52 - the lower left corner of your screen
00:54 - let's click on the windows icon and
00:56 - within here let's just type features to
00:59 - search for that and the top result here
01:02 - should be turn Windows Features on or
01:04 - off and you can also find that in the
01:06 - control panel if you dig down within
01:08 - there as well so once we open that up
01:10 - let's scroll down here towards the
01:12 - bottom until you see it's on my machine
01:15 - it's for up from the bottom that says
01:17 - windows subsystem for Linux so let's
01:20 - check that to turn that feature on and
01:21 - click OK and that's going to run through
01:24 - a couple of things here first to apply
01:25 - those changes and once that finishes it
01:28 - says that we need to restart our
01:30 - computer for those changes to take
01:32 - effect so I'm going to restart now and I
01:35 - will pick up the video after my machine
01:37 - is rebooted ok so now my machine has
01:39 - been restarted and I have logged back in
01:41 - now at this point there are a couple of
01:43 - different ways that we can get to the
01:44 - next step so the first way is if we open
01:47 - up our command prompt on Windows and
01:49 - then we type in bash and press Enter
01:52 - then we can see that it says that the
01:54 - windows subsystem for linux has no
01:56 - installed distributions and that we can
01:57 - install those by visiting the Windows
01:59 - Store and it provides a link here so we
02:02 - could paste that into a browser and it
02:04 - would take us to a list of those
02:05 - distributions in the Windows Store now
02:07 - another way that we can get to this step
02:10 - is just to simply open up the Windows
02:12 - Store so whichever way is easy
02:14 - for you so I'm gonna open up the Windows
02:15 - Store here so I could have either
02:17 - followed that link or you can come in
02:19 - here and type in Linux or a boon to so I
02:22 - will type in Ubuntu and press enter and
02:25 - when we search for that we can see that
02:28 - the first option here says Linux on
02:31 - Windows and then we can click to go get
02:33 - the apps and also listed down here and
02:35 - the apps we can see a boon to listed
02:37 - here so I'm gonna click on get the apps
02:39 - just to see all the different listings
02:41 - here so we can see within here we have a
02:43 - boon - and two others listed so for this
02:45 - video I'm going to install in boon too
02:47 - so I'm going to click on this and
02:49 - install it now this might take a second
02:54 - so I'm just going to fast-forward to the
02:55 - point where this installation is
02:56 - complete okay so once that installation
02:58 - is complete then you should get a
03:00 - notification here where you can launch
03:02 - this but if you accidentally closed that
03:05 - down or don't see that then we can
03:06 - actually launch this from the Start menu
03:08 - as well so if we open up the Start menu
03:09 - here then we should be able to see a
03:11 - boon - in here so now I'm going to open
03:13 - this up and now this is going to say
03:16 - that it's going to install some
03:17 - additional things and this could take a
03:19 - few minutes and also notice that when we
03:21 - open this we open this using the Ubuntu
03:24 - app we did not open the Windows command
03:26 - prompt so we'll look at running bash
03:29 - through our Windows command prompt soon
03:30 - but for now just be sure that you opened
03:33 - up the aboon - app so all of these long
03:35 - installations are just one-time things
03:37 - so don't worry you're not going to have
03:38 - to go through this more than once so I'm
03:40 - gonna fast forward this video here until
03:42 - this installation is complete okay so
03:45 - once that installation is complete then
03:47 - you should see a screen like this where
03:48 - it's asking for a unix username so for
03:50 - this i'm just going to type in core ems
03:53 - and hit enter and then it's going to ask
03:54 - for a password so i'm just going to put
03:57 - in a password really quick here and
04:00 - they'll ask to confirm that so i'll put
04:02 - in the same one okay so once you put in
04:05 - that information then you should see
04:06 - this screen here
04:07 - so this is our linux environment so let
04:09 - me make this text a little bit bigger
04:12 - here really quick so that everyone can
04:13 - see so let's say I'll bump this up to 36
04:18 - font and also actually I think that's
04:22 - fine right there so I'm just going to
04:23 - cancel out of that so now let me
04:24 - maximize this here and clear the screen
04:27 - so now we can use Linux commands like
04:28 - you may have seen in some of my other
04:29 - videos so if we print the current
04:31 - working directory and just do a PWD then
04:34 - you can see that we are in this home
04:36 - core ems folder and i'll it if i list
04:38 - all the files in this folder with an LS
04:40 - - la then we can see that we have a few
04:43 - dot files here now it's not entirely
04:45 - clear where we are on our system here
04:47 - like if we wanted to actually see some
04:49 - files on our Windows machine then where
04:51 - is our desktop and things like that well
04:53 - in the windows subsystem for linux our
04:55 - machine is accessible through a mount
04:57 - and in a minute i'll show you how to
05:00 - make a shortcut to this location but for
05:02 - now let's just navigate to that location
05:04 - and see what's there so to do this let's
05:06 - do and and I'm going to clear my screen
05:09 - let's do an LS on this mount folder here
05:13 - from the root directory and within Mount
05:15 - I can see this C directory and that is
05:17 - the C Drive on my machine
05:19 - so let's CD into that so I'm going to do
05:21 - a CD in to mount and into that C
05:25 - directory and now let's list what we
05:27 - have in here so I'm going to list
05:29 - everything so I'm going to do an LS - la
05:32 - so now within here we can see that we
05:33 - have our Program Files and users and
05:36 - things like that so now let's try to CD
05:39 - into my personal desktop so that is
05:42 - going to be within users so I will CD to
05:45 - users and then do an LS and we can see
05:47 - that we have this Quarry directory here
05:49 - so that's what it is on my machine it's
05:51 - going to be different on yours so now
05:53 - I'm going to clear my screen and CD into
05:55 - my home folder for my Windows machine so
05:58 - now if I do LS and there then we can see
06:01 - we have a lot of stuff here but one of
06:03 - these is the desktop and documents and
06:05 - downloads and things that you're used to
06:07 - seeing on your home user folder so let
06:10 - me CD to that desktop and hit enter and
06:14 - clear my screen and then do an LS la
06:17 - here okay so now let me clear out this
06:20 - screen here and now let's see if we can
06:22 - actually work with some files on Windows
06:23 - using bash so first let's try to create
06:27 - a file so let me say touch test dot txt
06:31 - and hit enter and actually this text
06:33 - might be just a little bit too big here
06:35 - so let me take this down a little bit
06:37 - here I'll do a size 32 font and I think
06:40 - that
06:40 - should still be readable but also can
06:43 - fit on one line there okay so now if I
06:45 - look at my Windows desktop here then we
06:48 - can see that it actually did create this
06:50 - test txt file on the desktop so that did
06:53 - work so what about editing this file
06:55 - within Linux so let's try to edit this
06:57 - file using Nano which is an easy text
07:00 - editor to use in bash so I will do a
07:02 - nano test txt and hit enter and this
07:05 - opens up the Nano editor so within here
07:08 - let's just say testing file and then I
07:12 - will close out of this and and when
07:14 - within Nano this is control X and hit Y
07:18 - to save and then hit enter to keep that
07:20 - file name and now if we cat the contents
07:22 - of that file to see what's in there so
07:24 - cat test text est then we can see that
07:28 - it did write that to the file ok awesome
07:31 - so this is working well so at this point
07:33 - if you're familiar with the linux and
07:35 - the command line then that is pretty
07:37 - much all you need to do in order to
07:38 - begin using it on windows so at this
07:40 - point you could stop watching the video
07:42 - and you'd be able to follow along with
07:44 - my command line videos in the future but
07:46 - for those of you who are interested I
07:47 - figured I'd also go over a few extra
07:49 - steps and show a few more things that we
07:50 - can do with this so first of all you can
07:52 - also install additional programs using
07:55 - the apt-get install so for example let's
07:58 - say that we wanted to use the tree
08:00 - command which is basically a nice way to
08:02 - see our file and directory structure so
08:04 - if we try to use this now and just type
08:06 - in tree then we can see that it says the
08:09 - program tree is currently not installed
08:11 - you can install it by typing sudo
08:13 - apt-get install tree now you could go
08:16 - ahead and run that but before that let's
08:18 - update and upgrade our packages so that
08:20 - we have the newest versions of
08:21 - everything and this can take a long time
08:23 - so just be aware of that and to do this
08:25 - we can do sudo apt-get and update to
08:30 - update to the latest versions and we
08:32 - need to type in our password here ok so
08:36 - now that's done with the update and also
08:38 - that password that I used for the sudo
08:40 - command that was the password that we
08:42 - specified for the unix user so be aware
08:45 - of that ok so now I'm going to clear
08:47 - this out and now I'm actually going to
08:49 - do an upgrade so instead of update we
08:52 - will do sudo apt-get
08:53 - upgrade and run that and we'll have to
08:56 - hit yes to continue here and now it will
08:59 - run through those upgrades and that can
09:01 - take a while so I'm going to skip
09:03 - forward until this is complete okay so
09:06 - once that is complete let's go ahead and
09:08 - install tree so to do this we can do
09:11 - sudo apt-get install tree and then need
09:17 - the sudo password again so then that
09:20 - should run through the installation and
09:22 - this one should be fairly quick okay so
09:25 - once that's complete we should be able
09:26 - to use the tree command so if we run
09:30 - that then we can see that we get this
09:31 - nice file and directory structure using
09:33 - the tree program that we just installed
09:35 - okay so now one last thing that I'd like
09:37 - to do is specify an alias so that we can
09:40 - quickly switch to our Windows home
09:42 - folder instead of needing to remember
09:44 - that it's under this mount seed
09:46 - directory so for now I'm going to change
09:49 - back to the Linux home directory and we
09:52 - can do that just by typing CD and now to
09:55 - create an alias we can edit the dot bash
09:58 - RC file in our home directory and we can
10:01 - do that so I'll just open that up in
10:02 - Nano so I will do the ampersand which is
10:06 - the same as our home directory that dot
10:08 - bash RC so open that up and within here
10:11 - we can see that it came with some stuff
10:12 - in this file already so let's just go
10:14 - down here below the part where it checks
10:16 - if this is running interactively or not
10:19 - and then we will put our alias in here
10:23 - so we can do this I'm just going to do
10:25 - an alias and I'll call this win home and
10:28 - equal to and no spaces between any of
10:31 - this and we want that to be equal to CD
10:34 - and then we'll just go to the home
10:38 - directory that I was just in so on my
10:40 - machine that is within users and quarry
10:43 - so now anytime I type win home it's
10:47 - actually going to do a change directory
10:49 - into this location and that is my
10:52 - windows home folder so now I'm going to
10:54 - exit out of this by hitting ctrl X since
10:56 - I'm in Nano Y to save and then enter to
11:00 - just keep the same filename now after
11:02 - we've saved that we need to source that
11:03 - file for those changes to take effect so
11:06 - we can just do that with ace
11:07 - and then the same file the dot bash RC
11:10 - file and our home directory and once we
11:12 - do that then we should be able to
11:13 - navigate to our windows home directory
11:14 - just by saying when home and hitting
11:17 - enter and you can see that we did CD to
11:20 - that directory okay so one more quick
11:22 - tip when working with bash on Windows so
11:24 - let me close this out here and open up
11:26 - the Windows command prompt and let me
11:29 - enlarge this so if you are ever using
11:32 - the Windows command prompt and want to
11:33 - switch over to using bash then you can
11:35 - easily do that just by typing bash and
11:37 - it will open up a bash terminal in the
11:39 - directory that you're currently in so
11:42 - when I first opened this it puts me in
11:44 - my home directory so let me navigate to
11:47 - my desktop and the command for that is
11:51 - the same on Windows as it is in bash we
11:53 - can just do CD desktop and hit enter and
11:55 - now that I'm on my desktop let's say
11:57 - that I wanted to use the grep command to
11:59 - search for some text within a names txt
12:01 - file that's in a demo folder here on my
12:04 - desktop now if I try to do this here in
12:06 - Windows command prompt so let me do a
12:08 - grep with some options of in I don't
12:12 - worry if you don't know
12:13 - grep it's not a big deal for this video
12:16 - I just wanted something to give an
12:19 - example here so the file that I want to
12:21 - grep and search for this name is within
12:24 - this demo folder and names.txt so if I
12:27 - run this within Windows it's not going
12:28 - to know what you're talking about it's
12:30 - gonna say that grep is not a recognized
12:32 - command so we really want to use bash
12:34 - here so if I type bash then it's going
12:37 - to open up our Linux terminal here and
12:40 - you can see that we're all it already
12:42 - put us in the location where we
12:44 - currently were in the Windows command
12:45 - prompt so that was on my desktop and now
12:47 - if I type out that command again and do
12:50 - the same search so let me type this out
12:53 - here and that was within demo and
12:56 - names.txt so now if I run that then you
12:59 - can see that that work just fine within
13:01 - a bash and we got the results that we
13:03 - were hoping to find and then to exit
13:05 - back out to our Windows prompt we can
13:07 - just type exit and it takes us back to
13:09 - our desktop where we currently were
13:11 - before we even went in okay so I think
13:14 - that is going to do it for this video
13:16 - now there are many more customizations
13:18 - that you can make to your bash terminal
13:19 - and I have some videos on that subject
13:21 - that I'll link to in the comment section
13:22 - below if anyone is interested in those
13:24 - so now after this video hopefully anyone
13:27 - using Windows should be able to follow
13:29 - along with any of my command line
13:30 - tutorials if those have ever been of any
13:32 - interest to you so for example I'll be
13:34 - releasing a video soon on how to use the
13:36 - grep command in depth and we saw that
13:38 - for a second in this video but grep is
13:40 - an extremely useful text searching tool
13:42 - in the command line especially once you
13:44 - learn the ins and outs to search for
13:46 - exactly what you want and I'll be using
13:48 - my Mac in that tutorial video but with
13:50 - bash now available on Windows 10 more of
13:52 - you should now be able to follow along
13:54 - with that video as well so if anyone has
13:56 - any questions about will be covered then
13:57 - feel free to ask in the comment section
13:59 - below and I'll do my best to answer
14:00 - those and if you enjoy these tutorials
14:02 - and would like to support them then
14:03 - there are several ways you can do that
