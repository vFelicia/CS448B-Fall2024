00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're just going to go over a
00:03 - quick to showing how you can hide secret
00:04 - information and environment variables
00:06 - and then access that information from
00:08 - your Python code now a common problem
00:10 - that I see from people who are just
00:11 - getting started out is that they'll put
00:13 - information directly in their code that
00:15 - actually shouldn't be there so for
00:16 - example if you're working with databases
00:18 - or are accessing an API and have a
00:21 - secret key then they'll have their
00:23 - passwords or secret keys directly in the
00:25 - Python script now the problem with that
00:26 - is that if you're working with a team of
00:28 - people or pushing your code to a
00:30 - repository of some kind then anyone who
00:32 - can see the code will also have access
00:34 - to that secret information but if you
00:36 - have that information saved and
00:37 - environment variables then you'll still
00:39 - be able to share your code but with your
00:41 - secret information saved on your local
00:43 - machine so let's see how we can do this
00:45 - so I have a script open here with some
00:46 - fake credentials and we can see that we
00:48 - have a database username and password
00:51 - hard-coded into our script and this
00:53 - could also be in a secret API key or any
00:56 - information that you don't want to share
00:57 - with everyone else who has access to the
00:59 - code so let's move these two environment
01:02 - variables now setting environment
01:04 - variables is done differently on Linux
01:06 - and Windows machines and in this
01:07 - tutorial we'll be covering how to do
01:09 - this on Mac and Linux but if you're on a
01:11 - Windows machine then I'll have a
01:12 - separate video on how to do this on
01:14 - Windows as well and I'll leave a link to
01:16 - that video in the description section
01:17 - below if anyone needs that but if you're
01:19 - on Mac or Linux then we can set these
01:21 - environment variables by modifying a
01:23 - file called dot Bash underscore profile
01:26 - so first let's open up our terminal and
01:29 - then we need to navigate to our home
01:31 - directory
01:31 - now I'm already in my home directory but
01:33 - if you need to navigate there then you
01:35 - can do that just by typing CD and
01:37 - pressing enter and now we need to open
01:39 - our dot file where we can set
01:41 - environment variables and I'll just open
01:43 - mine and Nano since that's an easy
01:44 - editor for everyone but you can also do
01:47 - this in whatever editor you'd like so
01:49 - I'll say Nano and that file was dot bash
01:51 - underscore profile now I might have some
01:54 - more information in here than you see in
01:55 - your file but don't worry about that so
01:59 - at the top of this file we can go ahead
02:00 - and add our environment variable now to
02:02 - do this we can just say export and then
02:05 - the name of our variable so we'll do an
02:07 - all uppercase DB user and then an equal
02:11 - sign with some quotes and we don't
02:13 - any spaces between the equal sign and
02:15 - the value and now let's go back to our
02:19 - script and grab this value so I can copy
02:22 - and paste it in and now let's do the
02:25 - same thing with the password so we'll
02:27 - say DB pass is equal to go back here and
02:31 - grab this from our file grab the whole
02:34 - thing copy that and paste that in and
02:38 - once we have those variables set then we
02:40 - can save this in Nano by pressing
02:42 - control X and then a yes to save and
02:45 - then enter to keep the same filename and
02:47 - now we can quit out of our terminal and
02:50 - now to actually see those changes we're
02:52 - also going to need to restart sublime
02:54 - text so I will shut that down and then
02:56 - open that back up to the same file and
02:59 - now let's access those variables that we
03:00 - just set now to do that we need to
03:02 - import the OS module and then with the
03:05 - OS module we can say OS dot and vine and
03:09 - this is a dictionary so we can access
03:11 - the key that we want by doing a dot git
03:14 - and then passing in what we want so we
03:17 - wanted the DB user environment variable
03:20 - and now let's also paste this in for the
03:23 - password so that was DB underscore pass
03:26 - so now let's save this and run it and
03:29 - now we can see that we get the values
03:31 - that we'd set in our environment
03:32 - variables without them actually being
03:34 - hard-coded into our script so that's
03:36 - going to be a lot better for us since we
03:38 - no longer have to worry about our
03:39 - passwords or secret information being
03:41 - added to our source code okay so I think
03:44 - that's going to do it for this video
03:45 - like I said this was just a quick short
03:47 - tip video about a common problem that I
03:49 - see amongst people who are just getting
03:50 - started out and if you've run into this
03:52 - before then hopefully you found this
03:53 - useful but if you do have any questions
