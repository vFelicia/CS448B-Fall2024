00:00 - hey how's it going guys i want to show
00:02 - you a quick tip on how to bring in some
00:04 - sample data into a fresh installation of
00:06 - wordpress
00:08 - this is great whenever you're developing
00:10 - a site locally and you need to see what
00:12 - your theme is going to look like
00:14 - whenever it encounters
00:16 - certain types of elements in a post you
00:18 - know you could have
00:20 - you could have images you could have
00:21 - image galleries you could have quotes or
00:24 - tables a lot of different things that
00:26 - you might not think
00:27 - to test whenever you're developing your
00:29 - site that could show up on your main
00:32 - blog down the road
00:34 - and it might not look the way that you
00:35 - planned on it looking
00:38 - so i'm going to show you
00:40 - a quick tip on how to bring in
00:42 - some data to solve that problem
00:45 - so right now i have a fresh installation
00:47 - of wordpress this is the default 2014
00:50 - theme it comes with the single hello
00:53 - world post
00:54 - this post has one comment
00:57 - um now i have a theme here for my
01:00 - website
01:01 - that i want to
01:02 - start developing with locally
01:05 - and if i activate that theme
01:07 - then you can see if i come back out here
01:09 - to the website
01:11 - then from where i only have the one post
01:13 - and the one
01:15 - widget in the sidebar it's kind of hard
01:18 - to tell
01:19 - what this theme is going to look like
01:21 - when it goes live
01:23 - whenever i first started doing this if i
01:26 - encountered this situation sometimes i
01:28 - would come in here to post
01:30 - and just click on add new and start
01:32 - adding in sample data and find some
01:35 - sample images and then i would try to
01:37 - make as many posts as i could that i
01:39 - might encounter on my live site um but
01:42 - that's
01:44 - very time consuming and
01:46 - um and not to mention that after all
01:48 - that time you still might
01:50 - miss a few things that you didn't think
01:52 - to check
01:53 - um
01:54 - so the best thing for this is something
01:56 - called wordpress theme unit tests
01:59 - and if we go over here to google
02:01 - if you just google wordp wordpress theme
02:04 - unit
02:04 - then the very top link here will be to
02:08 - the wordpress codecs so if you just
02:09 - click on that
02:11 - then right here
02:13 - it'll give you the test data that you
02:15 - can download so if we just
02:18 - save this xml file
02:21 - and i'm just going to save this into my
02:22 - downloads folder
02:26 - and if we go back to our website
02:29 - if we go down here to tools and import
02:34 - then from here we can
02:37 - click on this wordpress import and
02:39 - install this
02:42 - and then activate
02:44 - plug in and run the importer
02:47 - and then from here let's choose that
02:49 - theme unit test that we just downloaded
02:55 - and then click on upload file and import
03:00 - and then here
03:01 - if you have different authors on your
03:05 - on your website then you can assign
03:08 - those authors to
03:10 - different parts of the test data but i
03:13 - only have
03:14 - one
03:15 - demo user here so i'm just going to
03:16 - assign that demo user to every one of
03:19 - the authors and you want to be sure to
03:21 - click this here download and import file
03:23 - attachments because you want to
03:26 - import all the images that come with the
03:29 - with the theme unit
03:30 - test so once this is finished
03:33 - downloading
03:35 - it may take a second
03:37 - okay now that now that that's finished
03:39 - we can go back to our website
03:41 - and you can see here that it has added
03:43 - in a bunch of different posts and it has
03:47 - pretty much any markup and any
03:50 - elements that you're going to encounter
03:52 - in a live site so here you have all your
03:54 - headings
03:55 - you have tables lists
03:59 - you have some code there's sample images
04:02 - here um it'll tell you the what the
04:05 - dimensions of the image should be
04:06 - whether they're floated to the left or
04:08 - the right or align left or right
04:12 - it also has um
04:16 - some you can see there's four pages of
04:18 - uh of information here they have
04:21 - uh somewhere around here image gallery
04:22 - so yeah here they have image galleries
04:24 - that you can see how to look on your web
04:25 - page um so i highly suggest
04:30 - using this to
04:32 - test how your website is going to look
04:34 - because it pretty much covers anything
04:37 - that you're going to find
04:39 - whenever you go live
04:40 - but another thing here that i wanted to
04:43 - show you if you look over here you can
04:45 - see that
04:46 - i still only have the one widget it
04:49 - doesn't it only adds in posts it doesn't
04:51 - add in widgets so
04:53 - if i wanted to see what different
04:56 - widgets would look like on my page
04:59 - there is
05:00 - a plugin that we can install for that if
05:02 - we
05:03 - go back to our
05:05 - dashboard
05:07 - and go to add new on plugins
05:12 - there's a plugin if we just search for
05:14 - developer
05:18 - and these are the same guys who make
05:20 - jetpack that's automatic um if we
05:24 - install
05:26 - this developer plug-in
05:30 - and activate it
05:33 - and then it's going to ask you if this
05:34 - is a plug-in for self-hosted wordpress a
05:36 - theme or a theme for a wordpress.com vip
05:39 - site this is a theme for a self-hosted
05:42 - wordpress installation so choose that
05:45 - and there's a lot of different
05:48 - things that come with
05:50 - this developer plug-in and i'm not going
05:52 - to go over all of them but uh i you know
05:55 - i highly suggest going in here and
05:57 - checking out some of these um some of
05:59 - these are really useful uh this
06:01 - regenerate thumbnails will
06:04 - if you ever uh change the size of your
06:07 - images as you're testing out a theme
06:10 - then you can just run regenerate
06:11 - thumbnails and it'll take care of all
06:13 - those you can
06:14 - test your themes with these theme
06:16 - testers and theme checked
06:18 - but anyways the one that i wanted to
06:19 - show was this monster widget so let's
06:22 - click on install
06:25 - and now that that's finished installing
06:31 - let's go over here to
06:33 - appearance
06:34 - and widgets
06:36 - and now we'll see that we have
06:39 - this monster widget available
06:42 - and
06:43 - we can add this to
06:45 - any of our sidebars so
06:47 - the sidebars that i want to test out are
06:49 - my primary sidebar so i'll add it to
06:52 - that
06:53 - i want to test out my secondary sidebar
06:55 - i'll add it to that
06:57 - and all three of my footers so i'm going
06:59 - to add three of those
07:06 - okay
07:07 - and now that you've done that you can go
07:09 - back
07:10 - and check out what your site looks like
07:13 - and you can see here what this monster
07:14 - widget does is it adds in
07:17 - a lot of the different things that you
07:19 - can see on a live site so right here
07:21 - added in an archive list it's got your
07:23 - archive drop downs that you can choose
07:25 - from
07:26 - calendar category list category drop
07:28 - downs has a an rss feed some images down
07:33 - here
07:35 - if we go down to the very bottom
07:37 - we can see it does the same thing for
07:38 - the footer so we can see
07:40 - what our footers are going to look like
07:42 - now yeah obviously this isn't what it's
07:44 - going to look like on a live site
07:46 - because the monster widget has so much
07:48 - information in it you'd never have a
07:50 - footer this large
07:51 - but it gives you an idea of what these
07:54 - certain segments would look like
07:56 - on a live site so
07:59 - well that's about all i wanted to show
08:00 - you guys um
08:02 - a lot of people already know about this
08:03 - but if
08:04 - uh if you didn't hopefully it was useful
08:07 - i know whenever i found out about it it
08:08 - helped me out a lot i was kind of trying
08:12 - to
08:12 - um you know make these posts on my own
08:15 - and uh it took up a lot of time and i
08:18 - ended up missing a lot of things too so
08:20 - it's a lot easier just to pull in this
08:21 - theme unit test and be done with it um
08:23 - you know you can also try to pull down
08:25 - the live data from your database but
08:28 - if you don't have a plug-in like migrate
08:30 - db pro sometimes that can be harder than
08:32 - it has to be so i find this extremely
08:35 - useful especially whenever you don't
08:37 - care so much about the content and
08:38 - you're just trying to get an idea of how
08:40 - your theme looks visually it uh it
08:43 - really
08:44 - does well when it comes to that so
08:47 - yeah i hope this use i hope this uh tip
08:50 - was useful for you guys if you have any
08:52 - questions you know feel free to ask in
08:53 - the comments
