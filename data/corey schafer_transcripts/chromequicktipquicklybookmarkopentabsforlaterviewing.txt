00:00 - hey guys how's it going this is gonna be
00:02 - a quick little video here I just want to
00:04 - show you a situation that I run into
00:06 - from time to time and how I solve it so
00:10 - the situation I'm talking about is if I
00:12 - have a lot of tabs open but then I need
00:15 - to shut down my computer or shut down
00:17 - Chrome or something like that but I
00:20 - don't want to lose those tabs I want to
00:21 - come back to them at a later time so how
00:24 - do you do this quickly and easily
00:25 - without going in bookmarking each
00:28 - individual one or without copying and
00:31 - pasting all of the URLs into a text file
00:33 - or something like that well the way that
00:35 - I do this is fairly simple so if you
00:40 - have a bunch of tabs open then you can
00:43 - right click on the tab and then there's
00:45 - an option here that says bookmark all
00:47 - tabs so if you click that it's going to
00:50 - open up a bookmark all tabs option here
00:54 - and then usually within my bookmarks
00:57 - bookmarks bar I'll create a new folder
01:00 - and the folder I usually call it
01:03 - something like saved or something like
01:05 - that and then within the saved folder
01:07 - now this is just personal preference but
01:09 - I don't do this very often so I usually
01:12 - just date it so for this example I'll do
01:15 - Oh 7:30 15 now that's just a personal
01:18 - preference you know if you're reading
01:20 - about something specific then you can
01:22 - name it whatever you want to name it so
01:25 - let's click OK there and now if we open
01:28 - up a new tab then you can see that we
01:31 - have this saved folder here in our
01:34 - bookmarks bar so if we click on this
01:36 - saved folder and then you can see that
01:39 - it saved all of our bookmarks or all of
01:41 - our tabs that we currently had open so
01:44 - now let's say for example that I closed
01:46 - down Chrome and now I have a new Chrome
01:50 - window here so in order to open up all
01:53 - those tabs it's just as easy as looking
01:57 - at our dated folder here or whatever you
01:59 - named all of your tabs right-click it
02:02 - and there is an option here that says
02:04 - open all bookmarks so if we click on
02:06 - open all bookmarks then if you have
02:08 - enough tabs if it's only a few it's not
02:10 - going to ask you this but if you've had
02:12 - a lot of tabs open
02:13 - I'll say are you sure that you want to
02:15 - open up all these because it might take
02:16 - some time to load so just click yes and
02:18 - there you can see that all of the tabs
02:21 - that we had open are now loading up and
02:24 - we can close down our new tab there and
02:26 - then you can see that we have all of our
02:29 - tabs available that we saved so now once
02:32 - you're done reading through those tabs
02:34 - or whatever if you don't want to clutter
02:36 - up your saved folder here that you
02:38 - created then it's just as easy as
02:40 - right-clicking on that folder that has
02:44 - all the tabs that you saved then you can
02:46 - just click delete and it gets rid of it
02:48 - so that's the quickest and easiest
02:50 - solution that I've found to whenever I'm
02:53 - in this situation and I want to save a
02:55 - lot of times you know I used to go
02:57 - through and bookmark tabs individually
03:00 - but this is a lot faster and it's a lot
03:02 - easier and also you can get rid of them
03:04 - just as easy so I hope you guys found
03:07 - that video useful be sure to subscribe
03:09 - for future videos and thank you guys for
