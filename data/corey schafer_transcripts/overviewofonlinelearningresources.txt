00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in this
00:01 - video I wanted to do a broad overview of
00:04 - one line learning and the different
00:06 - resources that are available so there's
00:08 - such a vast amount of websites and
00:10 - places you can go online to learn about
00:12 - programming web development design
00:15 - software engineering basically anything
00:18 - that you'd want to learn about so these
00:20 - days I think it's entirely possible to
00:22 - be self-taught in your profession using
00:25 - these resources
00:27 - now when I say self-taught I'm not
00:28 - advocating against any type of higher
00:31 - education like I think there's a huge
00:33 - benefit to college and in-person classes
00:35 - but even if you are enrolled in
00:37 - something like that these online courses
00:40 - are still fantastic ways to complement
00:42 - that education and to reinforce what
00:45 - you've learned so with that said let's
00:47 - go ahead and get started
00:48 - so this first web site here is my
00:50 - personal favorite it's called Udacity
00:53 - and the courses you can see here are put
00:56 - together by Google Facebook and several
00:59 - other large companies you can see here
01:02 - that they have a variety of topics they
01:04 - have front-end web developer data
01:06 - analysis intro to programming full stack
01:09 - development things like that if we take
01:13 - a look at the full list of courses you
01:16 - can see that there are just tons of
01:18 - different topics and courses to choose
01:20 - from now one thing I really like about
01:23 - the courses that they offer here is that
01:26 - they also offer like fundamental courses
01:29 - so down here you can see like software
01:31 - debugging design of computer programs
01:33 - intro to algorithms software testing
01:36 - those are the kind of courses that are
01:39 - going to apply to just about any job
01:41 - within computer science no matter what
01:43 - language you decide to program in those
01:46 - fundamentals are going to be really
01:48 - important to learn but even after after
01:51 - you learn those fundamentals they still
01:52 - do offer things that are specific so for
01:56 - example here like object-oriented
01:58 - JavaScript data analysis with our so
02:02 - Udacity I think they offer a great
02:05 - variety of topics and the content is
02:07 - really well put together also one thing
02:11 - that I do with wish you'd asset II would
02:13 - change
02:13 - is like for example if I click on the
02:16 - intro to computer science class here I
02:17 - don't know about you all but my eyes are
02:20 - kind of immediately drawn to this big
02:23 - orange button here that says start free
02:25 - trial and this is only on some courses
02:28 - but then you see this big price tag here
02:30 - of a dollar or a $1.99 a month one
02:33 - hundred ninety-nine a month and I've
02:35 - told several people about this website
02:36 - and they see this and immediately click
02:39 - off of it and say that they didn't that
02:41 - they thought it was free well actually
02:42 - it is free this price tag here is just
02:46 - for like personal one-on-one coaching
02:48 - and to get a certificate after you
02:50 - complete the class each of these courses
02:52 - have this blue button here which mine
02:55 - says something different because I'm
02:56 - logged in I think yours may say like
02:58 - free course materials or something like
03:00 - that but you still get all the videos
03:02 - and you still got all the exercises you
03:04 - just don't get that one-on-one help from
03:06 - these coaches so if I was to click on
03:08 - this blue button here then it takes you
03:11 - to all of the videos and all of the
03:13 - lessons and these are all still free I
03:16 - really like the format of the courses
03:18 - that they've done here so they have
03:19 - videos and each lesson is kind of laid
03:23 - out here and they explain everything in
03:25 - the videos and then at certain points
03:28 - they will quiz you on the material so if
03:30 - I click on quiz here sometimes these are
03:32 - like multiple choice but a lot of the
03:34 - times it's an actual place online where
03:38 - you can code live code and see the
03:41 - results and I think that's great
03:44 - you know to do the videos and then to
03:46 - code I really think that you learn this
03:49 - stuff better whenever you write it out
03:50 - yourself rather than just watching it so
03:52 - I think the format that they have set up
03:54 - here is great so that's a quick look at
03:56 - Udacity it's my personal favorite but
03:59 - there's tons of other resources as well
04:00 - so here I just opened up MIT
04:02 - OpenCourseWare now this is something
04:04 - that a lot of colleges and universities
04:07 - are doing now where they will videotape
04:08 - their lectures and save their lecture
04:11 - notes and exams and quizzes and things
04:15 - like that and they'll put them all
04:16 - online for free so for example you can
04:18 - see here that in their electrical
04:20 - engineering and computer science courses
04:22 - they have all of these classes where
04:25 - they've added some type
04:28 - of material from that class that you can
04:30 - look at so all of these courses that
04:33 - they have listed here may not have
04:35 - videos but a lot of them do have lecture
04:37 - videos and they also have quizzes and
04:40 - exams and solutions and things like that
04:42 - so for example if I look over here this
04:45 - is introduction to algorithms and if we
04:48 - look down at the course features you can
04:50 - see that we have video lectures
04:51 - assignments and solutions exams and
04:54 - solutions and even transcripts of the
04:57 - courses now things like this are great
04:59 - this is what I meant by complementing
05:01 - your education because after I graduated
05:03 - from college algorithms is one of those
05:05 - things that I didn't really retain much
05:08 - of the information so being able to go
05:10 - back and take an intro to algorithms
05:13 - course from an MIT class was super
05:16 - helpful now a lot of these universities
05:18 - when they videotape these lectures they
05:20 - will put them up on YouTube and
05:21 - personally I like YouTube's interface a
05:24 - little bit better than these other
05:26 - websites so a lot of the time what I'll
05:28 - do is I'll just go to youtube and search
05:30 - for that University and then click on
05:33 - their YouTube channel then I'll go to
05:35 - their playlists and within their
05:37 - playlist I'll find the course that I'm
05:39 - looking for so for example here you can
05:41 - see that we have the same intro
05:43 - introduction algorithms course and you
05:45 - can scroll down through here and see the
05:46 - length of every video and also all the
05:49 - videos that they have available through
05:51 - that course now like I said MIT isn't
05:53 - the only University doing this so search
05:55 - for your favorite University and if they
05:57 - have a YouTube channel then most likely
05:59 - they'll have playlists associated if
06:02 - courses that they offer so for example
06:04 - if you search for Stanford and look at
06:06 - their playlists then they have a course
06:08 - up here called promote programming
06:10 - methodology where it's kind of an
06:12 - introduction to computer science and
06:14 - software engineering principles so I
06:17 - think it's great that a lot of these
06:18 - universities are starting to offer a lot
06:20 - of this material for free now since
06:22 - we're already on the topic of YouTube I
06:24 - wanted to mention that it's also a great
06:26 - resource itself pretty much any problem
06:29 - that you run into or anything that you
06:30 - want to learn about you can just search
06:32 - it and most likely there's going to be a
06:34 - video or several videos made on that
06:36 - topic so real quick let me go over a few
06:39 - of the channel so that I'm subscribed to
06:41 - I'm not gonna go into each individual
06:43 - one very into too much detail but if you
06:47 - were looking for a couple of channels to
06:48 - check out and maybe to subscribe to then
06:51 - these are a few the ones that I check
06:53 - regularly so Google developers they put
06:56 - up some good tips and tricks and also a
06:58 - few videos from some conferences the new
07:01 - Boston he has tons of subscribers and he
07:03 - does a wide variety of topics on just
07:06 - about any language you can think of he's
07:08 - probably done a series on that now this
07:12 - guy Dara ba√±os I hope I said that right
07:14 - he has a lot of great content that
07:17 - covers a lot of different topics I
07:19 - especially like the videos that he does
07:21 - on software design patterns and the
07:24 - fundamental topics that I was talking
07:26 - about earlier okay computer file now
07:30 - this isn't like your typical type of
07:32 - tutorials but I think it's a neat
07:34 - channel they do a lot of like history of
07:36 - computing and they also go in depth of
07:38 - into some topics like down here you can
07:41 - see that they have SQL injection and and
07:43 - they really show in depth how these
07:45 - things work do I have the computer guy
07:48 - is another good channel this guy does a
07:50 - lot of tutorials mainly on things like
07:53 - system administration and networking and
07:56 - things like that learn code Academy I
07:59 - think this is a newer channel I've just
08:00 - recently subscribed to it but it's
08:02 - really great it's more centered around
08:04 - web development and this guy does a
08:06 - great job of making short videos but
08:10 - fitting a lot of information into short
08:12 - videos and really getting the point
08:13 - across
08:14 - level up that's kind of the same thing
08:17 - centered around web development and also
08:19 - does a good job of fitting a lot of
08:21 - information into short videos dev tips
08:24 - this guy has a lot of good content and
08:27 - most of it is centered around web design
08:30 - so a lot of CSS and things like that
08:32 - okay speaking of CSS the channel Reese
08:36 - real CSS tricks is run by the guy who
08:38 - does CSS tricks comm Chris queer he
08:42 - doesn't put up videos a lot but when he
08:44 - does put up a video it's usually of a
08:46 - real-world problem that he ran into and
08:48 - how he solved that so I think those
08:50 - videos are extremely useful so just a
08:54 - few more here PHP academy'
08:55 - does some great PHP videos this guy
08:59 - syntax does some good Python programming
09:02 - videos so these next to new circle
09:05 - training and next a video both of them
09:08 - put up good videos and a lot of them are
09:11 - taking taken from talks from conferences
09:14 - and things like that
09:15 - now speaking of conferences if you have
09:17 - a favorite conference then search for
09:19 - that conference on YouTube and they
09:20 - might have a channel so for example I'm
09:23 - on the Python channel here for 2015 now
09:26 - some of these conferences you may not be
09:28 - able to afford to go and travel there in
09:31 - person but a lot of them put their
09:33 - videos online for free and they're super
09:36 - useful and have a lot of great content
09:38 - so that's a few of my personal
09:40 - suggestions for YouTube
09:41 - let's go ahead and take a look at some
09:43 - other websites so Khan Academy is more
09:46 - famous like for their math tutorials and
09:48 - science and economics and things like
09:49 - that but they do have a computing
09:51 - section so they have this computer
09:53 - science section where they go over like
09:55 - algorithms and the fundamentals I
09:57 - mentioned are there and then they have a
09:58 - computer programming section where I
10:00 - believe that the majority of their
10:03 - material is web development based so
10:06 - like JavaScript and HTML and CSS and
10:09 - things like that
10:09 - now they don't have a ton of computing
10:11 - material on Khan Academy right now but
10:14 - the stuff that they do have is really
10:16 - good but the most benefit that I get
10:18 - from Khan Academy is their math section
10:21 - so if you're in computer science and
10:23 - you're looking to level up on your math
10:25 - skills
10:26 - I think Khan Academy is one of the best
10:27 - resources out there and they have a ton
10:30 - of great classes they have pre calculus
10:32 - differential calculus linear algebra
10:35 - things that are going to come in handy
10:38 - big time for your career down the road
10:40 - now another website I wanted to take a
10:42 - look at is one called one called note
10:45 - school I oh now I really like the
10:48 - approach that note school takes to their
10:50 - tutorials so it's not like other
10:53 - websites most of their tutorials are
10:56 - based in the terminal so for example if
10:59 - I pull up my terminal here and if for
11:02 - example I wanted to take the node
11:05 - tutorial on their website then I could
11:07 - copy in this NPM and
11:09 - all command now you have to have no js'
11:11 - installed but that's outside the scope
11:14 - of this video I just want to kind of
11:16 - show you how the website works but you
11:18 - install this package onto your computer
11:21 - through via the terminal and then when
11:24 - that package finishes installing in your
11:27 - terminal then you can just run that
11:29 - package within your terminal and then
11:31 - the entire tutorial runs within your
11:33 - terminal which is really neat now the
11:36 - thing I really like about this format of
11:38 - tutorial is that not only are you
11:40 - learning the topic that they're trying
11:42 - to teach you but you're also learning a
11:44 - lot of terminal commands which is more
11:46 - important than a lot of beginners think
11:48 - you know some people think that it's
11:50 - this esoteric skill that you don't
11:52 - really need to know but if you learn it
11:56 - really well early on then you'll realize
11:59 - kind of how crucial it really is and so
12:02 - these walkthroughs do a great job of
12:04 - teaching the topic and making you
12:07 - somewhat proficient with the terminal so
12:11 - that was note school IO and I think they
12:13 - have a pretty unique approach to how
12:15 - they do their tutorials now moving onto
12:19 - the next website this one is called code
12:21 - Academy calm and on here you can see
12:24 - that they mainly focus on web
12:27 - development skills and it's very
12:29 - interactive also so whenever you go and
12:31 - take a tutorial most of the time you
12:34 - will be typing your code directly into
12:37 - the browser and then it will check
12:39 - against that code to make sure that it's
12:41 - right I think that's the best way to
12:42 - learn is by doing and they also provide
12:45 - these API tutorials now I think these
12:49 - API tutorials are super useful because I
12:51 - don't think enough emphasis is shown in
12:54 - the other websites I've shown on api's
12:56 - if you don't know what an API is
12:59 - basically it is a way to use information
13:02 - that other people provide so for example
13:05 - if we were to take this tour tutorial on
13:09 - the Twitter API maybe you want to make
13:12 - an application that maps out tweets onto
13:16 - a map of a certain topic and when those
13:19 - tweets were tweeted out and things like
13:21 - that that's something that you can do
13:22 - with an API be
13:23 - Twitter provides that information
13:26 - through their API publicly and like I
13:29 - said in the other resources I showed I
13:30 - don't think they that they have enough
13:33 - emphasis on programming with API so I
13:35 - think it's really neat that code Academy
13:37 - here does these different tutorials and
13:39 - how that you can work and how you can
13:40 - work with these different API is that a
13:43 - lot of companies provide now the what
13:45 - next website I'd like to show you is one
13:47 - called
13:47 - EDX now I've never personally used EDX
13:51 - but it's something that I here brought
13:53 - up a lot in podcast and and online
13:56 - forums if you look at their courses for
14:00 - computer science I have these filtered
14:01 - out here it looks like they have a lot
14:04 - of great material here they have intro
14:06 - to computer science through Harvard some
14:09 - introduction to Linux now most of these
14:11 - courses are free but you'll see here
14:14 - some of these that are tagged with this
14:15 - professional education here those are
14:18 - not free so for example if I clicked on
14:22 - this class here you can see that it does
14:26 - have a price tag of nearly five hundred
14:28 - dollars now that's a good segue into
14:31 - what I wanted to talk about next every
14:34 - resource that I've shown you so far has
14:37 - been a free resource but if the
14:40 - information that you're looking for is
14:41 - only offered for through a paid class or
14:46 - something online and you shouldn't
14:48 - always shy away from paying for your
14:51 - education so for example this class here
14:54 - at $500 it seems like a lot of money and
14:56 - it is a lot of money but if you compare
14:58 - that cost to taking a class you know
15:01 - through University or through an
15:04 - in-person workshop then it's really not
15:06 - that bad and if the topic that you're
15:08 - paying for in this example Linux system
15:11 - administration if it's something that is
15:13 - your professional job then really that
15:16 - money that you spend on the class is
15:18 - just a drop in the bucket compared to
15:20 - the return that you're going to get on
15:22 - that education throughout your career so
15:25 - with that said there's a couple more
15:26 - websites here that I want to show you
15:28 - that aren't entirely free but the
15:30 - content that they put together I think
15:32 - is it would be worth it for some people
15:36 - so
15:36 - this website here is called code school
15:38 - and you can see that their topics mainly
15:41 - revolve around web development you have
15:43 - JavaScript Ruby on Rails SQL and some
15:48 - angular classes now some of these they
15:50 - do offer for free you can see that this
15:52 - try SQL course here is listed as a free
15:56 - course Google Maps Google Drive things
16:00 - like that are some free courses that
16:02 - they offer this first JavaScript class
16:04 - is free but say for example you want to
16:06 - take a class on angularjs and you can't
16:09 - find any great tutorials elsewhere then
16:11 - paying for that class may be an option
16:14 - that you want to consider and if you
16:15 - look at the pricing for websites like
16:17 - this it's really not that bad when you
16:20 - can pair it to paying for classes in
16:23 - person so for example on code school you
16:25 - can get classes for twenty nine dollars
16:28 - a month or two hundred and ninety
16:30 - dollars per year so the next website I
16:33 - want to show you here which is also
16:35 - mainly revolving around web development
16:40 - and web design is tree house so tree
16:43 - house I think is a great website you can
16:45 - see here that they offer HTML Javascript
16:48 - Python Java classes and things like that
16:51 - I think one criticism that treehouse
16:53 - used to get when they first started is
16:55 - that the content was mainly focused for
16:59 - people who were beginners I have an
17:01 - account through them and lately I've
17:03 - seen some more advanced classes coming
17:05 - out and there's some good content there
17:07 - and so if we go over and look at their
17:09 - pricing then it's kind of a similar
17:10 - situation it's really not that bad in
17:12 - the grand scheme of things so their
17:14 - basic plan is $25 a month and the pro
17:16 - plan is 50 bucks a month so the next
17:19 - website I want to show you is another
17:20 - paid tutorial website but there's a
17:23 - loophole to paying for this website that
17:24 - I'm not sure that a lot of people are
17:26 - aware of the website I'm talking about
17:28 - is lynda.com now Linda is a very popular
17:31 - website you can see down here that they
17:34 - have all kinds of topics of foundations
17:36 - of programming fundamentals JavaScript
17:38 - essential training PHP Java get and
17:42 - github raspberry pi C++ so their topics
17:46 - pretty much span the entire spectrum
17:48 - now that loophole that I was talking
17:50 - about in the
17:50 - is that Linda does a great job of
17:54 - partnering with universities and with
17:56 - businesses so I've had login IDs for
17:58 - three different universities one of
18:00 - those universities was where I got my
18:02 - undergraduate one is where I worked
18:04 - after my undergraduate and one another
18:07 - one was for my graduate degree and all
18:09 - three of these universities had
18:11 - partnerships with lynda.com which meant
18:13 - that they paid for a premium membership
18:15 - and allowed you to log in through their
18:17 - portal into Lynda and view any tutorial
18:20 - that you wanted to view now another
18:22 - thing that I personally noticed was that
18:24 - not one of those three universities did
18:27 - a good job of advertising that
18:29 - partnership that they had so I had to go
18:31 - out and seek out that information on my
18:33 - own so if you're in school or you work
18:35 - for a company that pays for tutorials
18:37 - then be sure to check with them to see
18:40 - if they are partnering with somebody
18:41 - like this because you could potentially
18:43 - be missing out on a premium membership
18:46 - to a lot of great content
18:48 - now the next website I want to show you
18:50 - isn't a website that you would normally
18:52 - associate with learning programming but
18:54 - if used correctly then you'd be
18:56 - surprised how much you can actually
18:57 - learn from following other people on
19:00 - Twitter so Twitter is a great place to
19:03 - follow professionals in your field so
19:06 - for example I've been doing a lot of
19:08 - Python programming lately so I can
19:10 - follow the person who created Python on
19:13 - Twitter and these people will post a lot
19:16 - of great articles and tutorials and
19:18 - things that are interesting to them
19:19 - which in turn will help me so for
19:23 - example I can also follow Raymond
19:24 - Hettinger who is a Python core developer
19:27 - and a the Beasley who authors a lot of
19:29 - Python books and also gives excellent
19:32 - tutorials on Python so try to follow
19:34 - people who are specific to your
19:36 - interests so for example if you're a web
19:39 - developer then maybe you want to follow
19:41 - addy Osmani and Paul Irish and people
19:44 - like that
19:45 - now another website that I think is
19:47 - definitely worth checking out now
19:49 - there's a few websites that have been
19:50 - popping up like this lately but my
19:53 - favorite is code pen so what code pen is
19:56 - is it's a way for people from within the
20:00 - community to come in and create
20:02 - demos and within those demos you can
20:05 - come in and see the final product down
20:09 - here at the bottom but then you can come
20:11 - in and look at the HTML and CSS and
20:14 - JavaScript that it took to make this
20:17 - final product so you can learn a lot by
20:19 - coming in and seeing what other people
20:21 - are doing and how they did it now the
20:24 - next place that you can go for some
20:26 - great information is on reddit now kind
20:30 - of similar to Twitter reddit isn't
20:32 - actually the resource itself but has
20:34 - links to a lot of great resources so
20:37 - this is where community members can come
20:38 - and post articles and people will vote
20:42 - them up based on their relevance and
20:43 - also give a lot of good insight in the
20:45 - comments to what ever articles or videos
20:48 - that they post so for example I'm in the
20:51 - programming subreddit here and you can
20:53 - see that there's over 600,000 readers of
20:57 - the subreddit so there's a lot of good
20:59 - information being posted and voted on
21:01 - and commented on here so it's great to
21:03 - check out and learn from other people so
21:05 - some of the ones I go to frequently are
21:08 - this one is the programming subreddit
21:11 - and we also have a web dev subreddit
21:13 - there's also a web design subreddit that
21:17 - you might want to check out and also you
21:19 - can get more specifically to if you'd
21:21 - like so for example like I set up and
21:24 - doing a lot of Python programming so
21:25 - maybe I'll subscribe to the Python
21:28 - subreddit and if you are more of a
21:30 - JavaScript programmer then you can go
21:33 - and look at that reddit page now the
21:35 - next website which is very similar to
21:37 - Reddit is hacker news now I don't
21:39 - personally use hacker news but I've
21:41 - heard a lot about it and felt like I
21:43 - should definitely include it in the list
21:45 - it's similar in the sense that people
21:47 - can post resources that they find
21:50 - interesting and videos and blog articles
21:52 - and things like that and the good ones
21:54 - will get voted up to the top and people
21:57 - can make comments as on that resource
22:00 - saying what their opinion is about it so
22:03 - we're just about finished up here but
22:04 - there's one more resource that I wanted
22:07 - to show you so most everything I've
22:09 - shown you so far has been more for
22:11 - visual learners like so you'll watch
22:14 - videos and then you'll do coding
22:15 - exercises
22:16 - afterwards and things like that but for
22:18 - people who prefer books there are a lot
22:21 - of free books out there with a lot of
22:23 - great content and many of those books
22:25 - are posted online so if you google free
22:29 - programming books this is one of the
22:31 - first links on Google that you'll get
22:33 - and this is on github and it's a
22:35 - repository by VHF and you can see here
22:39 - that it's a very popular repository has
22:41 - over 40,000 stars on github so whatever
22:45 - your topic you're looking for just
22:47 - scroll down through the index here and
22:49 - say that you're looking for JavaScript
22:51 - so within the JavaScript section they
22:54 - have a ton of books here listed that are
22:56 - available for free online so this one
23:00 - here learning JavaScript design patterns
23:01 - by addy osmani that I mentioned earlier
23:03 - if you click on that you can see that it
23:06 - goes to the book online here and you can
23:10 - read the entire thing online for free so
23:17 - if you're someone who prefers books over
23:18 - videos and coding exercises and things
23:20 - like that then definitely check out this
23:22 - github repository and you'll almost
23:25 - certainly find something that interests
23:27 - you so that about does it for this video
23:29 - you know there's such a large number of
23:32 - resources online to learn this stuff so
23:36 - I'm sorry if I left any out or forgot
23:38 - any important ones but if you do have
23:41 - any favorites then just post those in
23:42 - the comment section below so that other
23:44 - people can check those out so I really
