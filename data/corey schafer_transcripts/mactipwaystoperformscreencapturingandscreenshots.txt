00:00 - hey what's going on guys I wanted to
00:02 - make a quick little video to show you
00:04 - how to do screenshots on the Mac a lot
00:06 - of you guys may already know how to do
00:08 - this but for those of you who don't I
00:11 - wanted to walk through a few of the
00:12 - different ways that you can do this so
00:14 - the first way is plain and simple if you
00:17 - just hit command shift 3 on your
00:19 - keyboard then you will see that it takes
00:23 - a screenshot of the entire desktop and
00:25 - just places it ear on your desktop so if
00:27 - I open this up then you can see it took
00:30 - a an image of my entire screen so that's
00:35 - the easiest way just to do screenshot of
00:37 - the entire screen and save it to your
00:39 - desktop if you want more control instead
00:42 - of command shift 3 if you hit command
00:44 - shift 4 then you will see these
00:46 - crosshairs pop up and what you can do
00:49 - with these crosshairs is just drag them
00:51 - over top of the part of the image that
00:53 - you want and it will also save to your
00:56 - desktop size so here you can see that
00:58 - this image saved to the desktop here
01:02 - there's a few different keys that you
01:08 - can use with the crosshairs if you hold
01:11 - in shift while you're dragging then you
01:13 - can restrict it to drag only down so if
01:17 - I move out here to the right then it's
01:19 - restricted and then if I release shift
01:21 - it'll be I can go in any direction I
01:24 - want and then if I hold in shift again
01:26 - and move it right then I can move to the
01:28 - right without moving down so it kind of
01:30 - restricts your movement if you need to
01:33 - if you need to be precise there you can
01:36 - also hold in option and what option does
01:39 - is instead of dragging from the top left
01:43 - corner it drags from the center so this
01:46 - is really useful if you say for example
01:49 - I wanted this folder here to be in the
01:53 - center of my image I could hit command
01:55 - shift 4 and hold down the option key and
01:58 - click and drag and no matter where I
02:00 - drag this that folder is going to be
02:02 - directly in the middle of my image
02:07 - another thing that you can do with
02:10 - command shift 4 and your cursor is you
02:13 - hold in space and when you hold in space
02:16 - say you start to draw and you realize
02:19 - that you're in the wrong spot if you
02:20 - hold in space then you can just move
02:22 - your window so if I wanted to start this
02:25 - drawing at the top of top corner of that
02:27 - window then I can just hold in space and
02:29 - drag down until I'm there and at any
02:34 - time if you're doing a screen shot and
02:36 - you're not happy with where you are then
02:37 - you can hit escape and it'll just cancel
02:40 - out so another way that you can do
02:44 - screen shots is if you hit command shift
02:46 - 4 again and see your crosshairs pop up
02:49 - and now with the crosshairs on the
02:51 - screen if you hit space then you'll see
02:53 - a little camera here and what the camera
02:55 - is is it takes a screenshot of entire
02:57 - windows so so if I just click on this
03:01 - window then I don't have to line those
03:05 - crosshairs up it just takes an image of
03:09 - the window and you can see that the it
03:11 - also captures those curves and
03:13 - everything that you would have been able
03:14 - to do with the crosshair so if you want
03:16 - to take an image of a complete window
03:18 - then that's the way you should do it
03:20 - so for basic screenshots that should be
03:22 - just about all you need to know but
03:24 - there are some more advanced things we
03:26 - can do for example whenever I do
03:28 - tutorials sometimes I'll need to drop a
03:31 - menu down and show exactly where my
03:33 - cursor is and an image and we can't
03:37 - really do that with the methods I just
03:39 - showed you but there are some ways that
03:42 - we can do this so if I open up the
03:45 - terminal then we can actually run this
03:50 - screen capture from the terminal with
03:53 - some options that we set so I'll go
03:56 - ahead and do this and walk you through
03:59 - as I go so if we type in screen capture
04:01 - and then I type in a C uppercase C that
04:06 - will tell the screen capture to capture
04:11 - my cursor also and then if I do a T
04:13 - uppercase T that means that this
04:16 - screenshot capture will be on a timer
04:18 - and then we set the timer in seconds I'm
04:21 - going to set this to 5 seconds and this
04:24 - doesn't default to the desktop so I'm
04:26 - actually going to have to
04:27 - like this in manually desktop and i'll
04:30 - call this image SS P&G and as soon as i
04:34 - hit enter it's going to start that timer
04:36 - and then i can go and do whatever I
04:39 - needed to be captured in an image and
04:41 - then it'll save that to the location I
04:45 - typed in so I'll go ahead and hit enter
04:47 - and then go over here to my menu and you
04:51 - know do whatever it is that I needed an
04:54 - image taken care of and so after that
04:56 - five seconds it took the image and if I
04:58 - look here at the desktop then you can
05:01 - see that it captured everything here has
05:03 - the has the mouse and the interaction
05:06 - that I was performing when it took the
05:08 - screenshot we can also change some of
05:12 - the default settings for the screen
05:14 - capture within the terminal so for
05:18 - example if I go in here into the
05:19 - terminal and I type in defaults right
05:23 - comm dot Apple screen capture then a few
05:30 - of the options that I can change I can
05:32 - change the image type to do that I would
05:34 - just type in type jpg or type PNG it's
05:39 - PNG by default you can also change the
05:44 - the location for where it saves images
05:47 - by default so let me go ahead and show
05:51 - you this so for example if you look over
05:52 - here at the desktop it'll get a little
05:54 - cluttered if you take a whole lot of
05:56 - screenshots so I could make a folder
05:59 - here and just call this folder or
06:04 - screenshots and I'll go ahead and copy
06:09 - that and then if I go back here to the
06:12 - terminal and have my defaults right calm
06:15 - down Apple screen capture and then I can
06:18 - type in location and then I'm just gonna
06:21 - set this to the location that I just
06:24 - created screenshots okay and let's go
06:29 - ahead and
06:31 - take a screenshot and make sure that
06:34 - that worked okay now that didn't work
06:38 - because there was one step that I forgot
06:40 - to do here anytime I change any of these
06:43 - defaults in the terminal then I also
06:45 - have to restart something called the
06:48 - system UI server so to do that after I
06:51 - made the change then I can type in kill
06:55 - all the system UI server and that will
07:01 - restart that screen capture software and
07:04 - and those changes will take place so now
07:09 - if I take a screenshot then it should
07:16 - save it to the location that we
07:19 - specified and there it is so now we can
07:22 - move all these images that we just took
07:23 - over into our screenshots folder and
07:27 - that'll clean up the desktop for us and
07:31 - lastly I'm just going to show you one
07:33 - more option for taking screenshots if
07:35 - for some reason you don't like using
07:37 - keyboard shortcuts there is a way that
07:39 - you can do this with the mouse if you
07:41 - open up this application called preview
07:47 - then if you select File here then at the
07:52 - bottom you can see that you can go to
07:55 - take a screenshot and when you go to
07:57 - take a screenshot you can do all the
07:59 - options that we've already gone over you
08:01 - can do by selection you can do it by
08:03 - window or you can do by the entire
08:05 - screen one nice thing about doing it
08:07 - through the preview is that if you come
08:09 - in here and take your screenshot then
08:12 - it'll pull up this window here and show
08:15 - you what it looks like and instead of
08:17 - saving it by default you can close it to
08:20 - get rid of it or you can come in here
08:24 - and go to save and you can call it
08:28 - whatever you want you can change the
08:29 - file type and you can change the
08:31 - location that way you don't have to you
08:34 - know go in and mess with the terminal to
08:36 - do those advanced things you can do that
08:38 - through the preview application so
08:42 - well hopefully you guys got something
08:44 - useful out of this be sure to subscribe
