00:00 - hey everybody wanted to do a quick
00:02 - walkthrough here on how to use the font
00:04 - awesome icon font and your desktop
00:06 - applications first of all just go over
00:08 - to the phone awesome website and you can
00:11 - download the zip file from here and once
00:14 - that is downloaded go ahead and unzip
00:19 - that and navigate in here to this fonts
00:23 - folder and inside here you'll find this
00:25 - on awesome OTF file and now if we open
00:28 - up our Applications folder then we will
00:34 - find an application here called font
00:38 - book so go ahead and open that up
00:40 - and if we drag this font awesome not OTF
00:44 - file over here in the font book and it's
00:46 - going to install that onto our Mac so
00:48 - that we can use this in any of our
00:49 - desktop applications so if you go into
00:52 - the user file here you can see that font
00:54 - awesome has been added so we can go
00:56 - ahead and close these windows down and
01:00 - now back over here on the font on some
01:03 - website if we go up here to icon and
01:06 - then they have a link here called cheat
01:08 - sheet this is what we're going to use to
01:10 - use these fonts in our desktop
01:11 - applications so say we wanted to use
01:15 - this Apple logo here we can just
01:18 - highlight that and copy it and now let's
01:21 - open up an application I'll open up
01:23 - Photoshop here and create a new document
01:27 - and this already has fallen awesome
01:31 - selected for me but it's something else
01:33 - for you then go ahead and select that
01:34 - from the drop-down menu and then you can
01:36 - just go ahead and paste that in there
01:37 - and so as you can see the icons work and
01:41 - we can get rid of this text and you can
01:44 - use this icon just like any other font
01:47 - so you can you know take the size up
01:51 - without losing any clarity you can
01:55 - change its color yeah and you can use
