00:00 - hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01 - this video we're going to be going over
00:02 - scatter plots so scatter plots are great
00:05 - when you want to show the relationship
00:06 - between two sets of values and see if
00:09 - they are correlated so first we're going
00:11 - to look at a basic example of a scatter
00:13 - plot using some data within our Python
00:16 - script here and then we'll look at some
00:17 - real world data that I have within a CSV
00:20 - file and the data within the CSV file
00:22 - are the views and likes of YouTube
00:25 - videos on the trending page the day that
00:27 - I made this video so that might be
00:29 - interesting to plot out now I would like
00:31 - to mention that we have a sponsor for
00:33 - this series of videos and that is
00:34 - brilliant org so I really want to thank
00:36 - brilliant for sponsoring this series and
00:38 - it would be great if you all could go
00:39 - check them out using the link in the
00:41 - description section below to support the
00:43 - sponsors and I'll talk more about their
00:44 - services in just a bit so with that said
00:46 - let's go ahead and get started ok so
00:48 - I've got some sample code pulled up here
00:50 - in my script
00:51 - now first we'll see how to use these
00:53 - scatter plots using this list of data
00:55 - directly within my script and then we'll
00:58 - look at a real world example with data
00:59 - that I'll load in from a CSV file now if
01:02 - you've been following along with the
01:03 - series then you'll likely recognize the
01:05 - other matplotlib code that I've got here
01:07 - at the moment but if not then let me go
01:10 - go ahead and go over this real quick so
01:12 - here at the top of the file I'm
01:13 - importing pandas I'm also importing PI
01:16 - plot from the matplotlib library we are
01:19 - using a plot style here of Seabourn
01:23 - we've been using 538 a lot throughout
01:25 - the series but I want to show what some
01:27 - of these different styles look like now
01:29 - we just have some x and y data here of
01:32 - some random points between 1 and 10 I've
01:35 - got some other code commented out here
01:38 - for now don't worry about that we'll
01:40 - talk more about that when we get to it
01:42 - we also have a title here for our plot x
01:46 - and y label those are common and out at
01:49 - the moment we also have a tight layout
01:51 - here with just which just add some
01:53 - automatic padding to our plots and also
01:55 - we're doing
01:56 - PLT show which will actually show our
01:59 - plot ok so now let's look at how to
02:01 - create a basic scatter plot ok so I've
02:04 - got a random list of values here for an
02:06 - x-axis and a random list of values here
02:08 - for a why axis and some of these values
02:11 - are repeated so
02:13 - to create a scatterplot out of these
02:15 - values it's as simple as saying
02:18 - PLT dot scatter and we want to do our X
02:23 - and our Y values so if I run this and
02:27 - let me make this a little larger here
02:30 - then we can see that we have a scatter
02:31 - plot of these random values now scatter
02:34 - plots are really nice for seeing
02:35 - different trends or outliers or things
02:38 - like that now since these are random
02:40 - then we don't really have any trends
02:42 - here but sometimes that's important to
02:44 - know also that there's not a trend
02:46 - so our scatter plot since it looks
02:48 - random like this then this likely tells
02:50 - us that there's no correlation between
02:52 - our two lists of random values and we'll
02:55 - see data data set here in a bit that is
02:57 - more correlated with the values but for
03:00 - now let's look at some basic
03:01 - customizations that we can make to our
03:03 - scatter plot so first of all I feel like
03:06 - the sizes of the dots here are a bit
03:08 - small on this plot and you can change
03:10 - that by setting the size and that is an
03:14 - S argument so we'll set s equal to these
03:18 - sizes are always a bit weird I have to
03:20 - always look up in the documentation how
03:22 - these aren't related but if we run this
03:26 - then now we can see that these dots are
03:29 - a little bit larger here on our scatter
03:31 - plot now if you bump that up to like 500
03:34 - or something then it would really be
03:36 - noticeable so we can also change the
03:38 - color and the marker styles of these
03:40 - plots as well so to change the color we
03:43 - can simply pass in a c' argument so
03:47 - we'll say C is equal to Green and there
03:50 - are all kinds of different marker styles
03:53 - that we can use as well I'm going to
03:54 - leave a link to the page where you can
03:56 - go find the different styles I'll leave
03:58 - a link to that in the description
03:59 - section below if you'd like to see the
04:01 - different styles but for example if I
04:04 - wanted to have like an X symbol then as
04:07 - our marker then I could simply say
04:09 - marker is equal to X so if we save that
04:13 - and we run it then we can see that now
04:15 - we have green markers and these green
04:18 - markers are shaped like X's so let me
04:21 - close that out now I almost never use
04:23 - anything other than to default markers
04:25 - but the option is a
04:27 - there if you want it but I'm gonna
04:29 - remove that for now and just go back to
04:31 - those default Circle markers now another
04:34 - thing about scatter plots is that I
04:36 - think they look a lot nicer if we add
04:38 - edges to the circles and also give them
04:40 - some alpha so that we can see through
04:42 - them a bit so to show you what this
04:43 - looks like let me add an edge and a
04:46 - color so I'll say edge color is equal to
04:50 - we'll just set that equal to black
04:51 - that's going to be the edges of the
04:53 - circles and for the line width let's
04:57 - also set the line width of that edge
05:00 - equal to one and to give an alpha to our
05:03 - color so that it softens it up it a
05:05 - little bit it's as easy as just saying
05:07 - alpha is equal to let's do 0.75 so if I
05:13 - run this then we can see that now this
05:16 - looks a bit nicer here I think that
05:18 - these dots with these black edges looks
05:20 - a lot better now if your colors a bit
05:22 - too soft then you can always play around
05:24 - with that alpha okay so another thing
05:27 - that I want to show you is how the
05:28 - colors and sizes can actually be on a
05:31 - per mark basis rather than applying them
05:34 - to all of the marks so what would why
05:37 - would you want multiple colors or sizes
05:40 - well having the ability to have multiple
05:42 - colors and sizes actually allows us to
05:45 - add additional datasets into our plot so
05:48 - for example let's say that we have our
05:50 - current plot that we just looked at but
05:53 - we wanted to add some additional
05:55 - information so for example let's pretend
05:57 - that our current plot is some survey
06:00 - data about a bunch of people and we
06:02 - wanted to break down the data further
06:03 - into something more specific so for
06:05 - example let's say that we had these
06:08 - people rate something from 1 to 10 and
06:10 - we wanted to somehow plot their rating
06:14 - as well well to do that we could simply
06:17 - assign different numbers to these
06:19 - different possibilities and those will
06:22 - then give you different colors on your
06:24 - scatter plot as long as you pass that
06:26 - into your method so I have a colors
06:28 - variable commented out here so let me
06:31 - uncomment this and let me move this
06:34 - above our scatter plot and I think this
06:37 - will make a bit more sense once we plot
06:39 - this out okay so the numbers
06:41 - this colors lists these are numbers
06:43 - between 1 and 10 now like I said before
06:45 - maybe this could be a person's answer to
06:48 - how satisfied they are with a certain
06:50 - product or something like that so each
06:53 - of these values will correspond to a
06:55 - data point in our x and y variables so
06:58 - now if we pass this into our scatter
07:01 - method as the color argument so I'm
07:03 - going to say whoops I accidentally
07:05 - pasted that I'm going to say see instead
07:08 - of being equally good at green I want it
07:10 - to be equal to colors so now I'm gonna
07:13 - run this then we can see that we get
07:15 - different color dots so what this is
07:18 - doing here is whenever we plot this x
07:21 - and y value here of 5 and 7 it also has
07:25 - a color of 7 and these different colors
07:28 - here 759 all of those are going to
07:31 - correspond to different colors here on
07:33 - our chart now I really don't like the
07:35 - colors that we're getting here these are
07:36 - just shades of gray we can actually
07:39 - change these by using a color map and
07:41 - just like the marker symbols there are a
07:43 - ton of built-in color maps that we can
07:46 - use and I'll be circling leave a link in
07:48 - the description section below to all of
07:50 - the color map options if you'd like to
07:52 - play around with these as well one that
07:54 - I personally like is called greens so if
07:58 - I come down here after colors and I say
08:01 - see map is that argument see map is
08:04 - equal to and that is greens with a
08:06 - capital G be sure I put in a comma there
08:09 - now let me run that and now we can see
08:13 - that now we're getting these different
08:15 - shades of green as the intensity so I
08:18 - think the lighter ones are closer to 0
08:21 - and the dark ones are closer to 10 but
08:24 - we really don't know based on how this
08:27 - is represented here so you're probably
08:28 - going to want to add a label for your
08:31 - color map too so that people viewing our
08:33 - chart know what these colors represent
08:35 - so to do that we can add a color bar
08:39 - legend so I'm going to close this down
08:41 - and below our scatter plot we can just
08:44 - say C bar is equal to and this is going
08:47 - to be PLT dot color bar and that is a
08:52 - method and now I'm going to say C bar
08:54 - dot set underscore label and now we can
08:59 - set a label for this so like I said
09:01 - maybe this could be like a satisfaction
09:03 - level or something so I'll just say
09:05 - satisfaction so now let me run that and
09:08 - now we can see that we have a color bar
09:12 - here on the right side and now we have
09:14 - multiple points of information here so
09:17 - we can see our XY data but then we can
09:19 - also see okay depending on how these are
09:22 - colored is that person's satisfaction
09:24 - level so these dark ones are very
09:26 - satisfied and the lighter color ones
09:28 - were not satisfied now we can also
09:30 - change the sizes of our data points as
09:32 - well so just like with the color this
09:35 - can add in an another way of explaining
09:37 - our data even further so for example I
09:40 - see a lot of scatter plots that use the
09:42 - size of the dot for things like
09:44 - population and things like that or maybe
09:47 - even the sample size for that data point
09:49 - so I've got a random list of sizes
09:51 - commented out down here as well so let
09:54 - me grab these and let me move those up
09:58 - underneath colors and just like with the
10:02 - colors this is a list of 20 different
10:04 - sizes here that correspond to the data
10:07 - points and the x and y variables that
10:09 - were plotting so if I was to pass in
10:11 - this sizes list here as my sizes so
10:16 - let's say I took sizes oh no sizes right
10:19 - here sorry so I will paste that in as
10:21 - sizes there and now if we run this then
10:26 - we can see that now each of these
10:28 - individual plots have a size as well and
10:31 - you can use that for different types of
10:33 - data okay so now that we've seen how to
10:35 - do these things with our simple sample
10:37 - data here let's now look at how we can
10:39 - plot out some real-world data from a CSV
10:42 - file that I have here in my current
10:43 - directory so in the CSV file I pulled
10:47 - down some of the data from the YouTube
10:50 - API and these were the 200 the top 200
10:53 - trending videos on the day that I
10:55 - recorded this video and I wanted to do a
10:57 - scatter plot of their total views and
11:00 - their total likes and I also calculated
11:02 - out the ratio of likes to dislikes as
11:05 - well now in a future video I'll actually
11:07 - cover the YouTube a
11:08 - di and show how I grab data like that
11:11 - from there but that's really a different
11:13 - topic so let's just continue focusing on
11:15 - matplotlib here for now and we'll save
11:18 - that for a future video so let me pull
11:20 - up this CSV file here and let's see what
11:24 - this looks like so I've got that CSV
11:27 - file open here and we can see that these
11:30 - are just the top 200 trending videos on
11:33 - YouTube
11:34 - the day that I recorded this so I didn't
11:37 - grab the the titles or anything like
11:39 - that I just wanted to see if there was a
11:40 - correlation between their view count and
11:42 - their likes so here we have the view
11:44 - count of the video and so each one of
11:47 - these is a different video this one had
11:49 - 8 million views this one had 9 million
11:51 - views and so on we have the likes for
11:53 - that video in the second column here and
11:56 - we also have the ratio of likes to
11:58 - dislikes now since this is on the
12:00 - trending page a lot of these have a high
12:02 - like to dislike ratio so this one has
12:05 - 96% likes two dislikes 98% and so on so
12:09 - we can probably take a guess that the
12:11 - more views a video has the more likes
12:13 - its gonna have but to see exactly what
12:15 - that correlation looks like we're gonna
12:17 - have to plot it out so I've got some
12:19 - code commented out down here at the
12:21 - bottom that'll pull in some data from
12:24 - that CSV so let's remove the sample code
12:27 - that we were working with earlier and
12:29 - uncommon out that other code so I'm
12:32 - going to keep our scatterplot here so
12:34 - I'm going to cut that out and I'm just
12:36 - gonna paste that down here between the
12:40 - ratio and the title now for everything
12:42 - else
12:43 - I'm just going to remove all of this
12:45 - sample data that we were using before
12:47 - okay and now let me uncomment out where
12:51 - I'm loading in that data and also these
12:54 - titles and X&Y labels here so let me
12:57 - describe how what we're doing when we're
13:00 - loading in the state of here now I've
13:02 - been using pandas read CSV method
13:04 - throughout this series but for those of
13:06 - you who haven't seen the rest of the
13:08 - series and are just watching this video
13:10 - let me quickly explain what this is
13:12 - doing so I'm reading in this CSV file
13:15 - and this is the name of the CSV file
13:16 - here and again this will be included in
13:19 - the description section below if you'd
13:21 - like to download this and follow
13:22 - long so it reads in that CSV and grabs
13:26 - all that data and then we're setting
13:28 - this view count variable here equal to
13:30 - data and the view count key now what
13:34 - that does is it sets this view count
13:37 - equal to that entire column so it's
13:40 - setting it equal to all of these view
13:41 - counts here and also with likes it's
13:45 - setting that equal to the likes column
13:48 - so it'll be equal to the first value is
13:50 - you know three hundred thousand five
13:53 - hundred and sixty thousand and so on and
13:54 - lastly ratio same thing it's getting
13:57 - that ratio key and setting it equal to
13:59 - that ratio column okay so to plot this
14:02 - out using the same scatter plot that we
14:04 - used before we can simply say that we
14:07 - want the view count let's put this on
14:09 - the x-axis and I'll put the likes on the
14:13 - y-axis now let me remove the size colors
14:19 - and the color map for now and I will
14:22 - leave the edge color set the black and
14:24 - the line width and the Alpha but the
14:28 - sizes colors and color map I'm gonna
14:29 - take out for now okay so let me run this
14:33 - okay so we can see here that we get a
14:37 - scatter plot now like I said this is the
14:39 - top 200 videos on the trending page so
14:42 - there should be two hundred dots here
14:44 - now it looks like some of our data is
14:46 - bunched here in the bottom left and
14:49 - that's because we have one outlier here
14:52 - and at the top right that was a video
14:54 - that had a lot more views and a lot more
14:56 - likes than the other views on the
14:58 - trending page actually went back to the
15:00 - original data to see what video was
15:02 - messing up my nice little scatter plot
15:04 - here and it was the new old town road
15:06 - music video by lil nas X and Billy Ray
15:10 - Cyrus so that's who to blame for that
15:12 - outlier but I'm actually glad that there
15:14 - was an outlier because it reminded me
15:16 - that we can use a log scale with scatter
15:19 - plots as well to lessen how much those
15:22 - outliers actually skew the plot so let's
15:25 - make this look a bit better and use a
15:28 - log scale for our axis we can simply say
15:32 - down here below our scatter method let's
15:35 - say PLT dot x scale and we will use a
15:41 - log scale for our x axis and we will
15:44 - also use a log scale for our y axis so
15:47 - I've got those put in there now if I run
15:51 - this then now that it's using a log
15:54 - scale instead of a regular scale now we
15:57 - can see that those outliers don't skew
15:59 - the data so much and that we can kind of
16:02 - see the correlation better here so the
16:04 - correlation between how many views a
16:06 - video has and how many likes it has
16:08 - really stands out here in this plot so
16:11 - now let's also use the ratio of likes
16:14 - and dislikes in this plot I think that
16:17 - would be a good metric to use for the
16:19 - color of our points and we could also
16:21 - try to use that for size as well but I
16:23 - think that the ratios might be a little
16:25 - bit too close for us to really tell the
16:27 - difference in sizes like we can for the
16:29 - colors so I'm just going to use the
16:31 - colors and not worry about the sizes so
16:34 - to do this I can close down our current
16:37 - plot and now I'm also going to use
16:40 - another color map so that we can see
16:42 - another example of a different color map
16:44 - so here within our scatter plot right
16:47 - after our likes this doesn't have to be
16:49 - in any particular order I just want to
16:52 - put them here I will say C is equal to
16:56 - and we want the color to be equal to the
16:59 - ratio so that will come in and it'll set
17:04 - the colors on a color map scale using
17:07 - these ratio values here for each of our
17:09 - markers so now that we have that I'm
17:13 - also going to pass in a C map a color
17:15 - map and let's use a color map of summer
17:18 - I think that's a color map that I liked
17:21 - all right and also below scatter let's
17:24 - also put a color bar so that we know
17:27 - what this represents so I'm gonna say C
17:29 - bar is equal to pl t dot color bar and
17:33 - now we want to set a label for that as
17:36 - well so I'll see C bar dot label and we
17:39 - will say like dislike
17:43 - ratio okay whoops not ration ratio okay
17:47 - so let me run this and make this a
17:51 - little larger here and I think that this
17:54 - looks really nice we can see now that we
17:57 - get those colors representing the like
17:59 - to dislike ratio and we have our color
18:01 - bar here telling us what these numbers
18:04 - actually represent so the ones that are
18:07 - more bluish green have you know
18:09 - performed less well the ones that are
18:12 - bright yellow performed better so the
18:14 - bright ones are up in the 90s and the
18:16 - ones that are a little darker and bluish
18:18 - green are kind of down in the 50s and
18:21 - 60s which would mean that they had
18:23 - almost as many dislikes as likes on that
18:26 - video but since I got these from the
18:27 - trending page most of these are actually
18:29 - going to be on the higher end since
18:31 - those are more popular videos anyway but
18:34 - we can see that we do have some dark
18:36 - ones mixed in here and most of those
18:38 - dark ones do fall on the bottom side of
18:41 - our page here so using a scatter plot
18:44 - like this is a great way to get the
18:47 - correlation for the values that you're
18:49 - plotting out and also using colors and
18:52 - sizes can you know add it to where you
18:54 - are adding in even more metrics and
18:56 - putting more information into your plots
18:59 - okay so we're just about finished up
19:01 - here but before we end I'd like to
19:03 - mention the sponsor of this video and
19:04 - that is brilliant org so in this series
19:08 - we've been learning about matplotlib and
19:09 - how to plot data in python and brilliant
19:12 - would be an excellent way to supplement
19:13 - what you learn here with their hands-on
19:15 - courses they have some excellent courses
19:17 - covering the fundamentals of statistics
19:19 - and these lessons do a deep dive on how
19:21 - to think about and analyze data
19:23 - correctly they even use Python in their
19:25 - statistics courses and will quiz you on
19:27 - how to correctly analyze the data within

19:31 - challenge you but you also have the
19:33 - ability to get hints or even solutions
19:35 - if you need them it's really tailored
19:37 - towards understanding the material
19:38 - they've also recently released a
19:40 - programming with Python course and they
19:42 - even have a coding environment built
19:44 - into their website so that you can run
19:46 - code directly in the browser and that is
19:48 - a great way to compliment watching my
19:50 - tutorials because you can apply what
19:52 - you've learned in their active
19:53 - problem-solving environment and that
19:55 - helps to solidify that now
