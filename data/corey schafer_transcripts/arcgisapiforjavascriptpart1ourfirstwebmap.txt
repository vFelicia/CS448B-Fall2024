00:01 - hey what's going on everybody this is
00:02 - going to be part one in a series of
00:05 - working with the arjs API for JavaScript
00:08 - in this tutorial we're going to create
00:10 - our first web map it's going to be very
00:13 - basic but we're going to hook up their
00:16 - API with our HTML files we're going to
00:18 - set up an external Javascript file an
00:20 - external CSS file um so with that let's
00:24 - go ahead and get started uh I'm already
00:26 - over here at the developers. arcgis.com
00:30 - uh website it is a a website where if
00:33 - you're going to be working with this API
00:35 - a lot then you should definitely
00:37 - bookmark it it has tutorials uh the API
00:40 - references some
00:42 - samples a lot of good stuff so let's go
00:44 - ahead and go over to
00:46 - tutorials and we will click on the link
00:49 - here that says build your first web
00:52 - application okay so uh they say right
00:55 - here before you begin uh that you need
00:57 - to set up a development environment so
00:59 - you need to set up a a web server and
01:03 - have a text editor or an IDE uh to write
01:05 - your code in I'm not going to walk
01:07 - through how to set up a web server uh if
01:09 - you need to do that then you can click
01:12 - on this link here and they have a lot of
01:13 - good
01:14 - recommendations uh as far as the text
01:16 - editor goes uh I'm in I'm doing the
01:19 - coding over here in Sublime Text uh I
01:22 - highly recommend it it's very popular it
01:24 - has a ton of features um and I have a
01:27 - video on uh setting up development
01:30 - environment deir environment in Sublime
01:33 - Text if you would like to take a look at
01:35 - that I'll put the link in the
01:36 - description uh so let's go ahead and get
01:39 - started with our map here okay so right
01:44 - now if I go over to my tab here on Local
01:47 - Host I have a very basic website running
01:51 - that says this is a demo page and this
01:53 - is the HTML for that web page so you can
01:56 - see here uh this is a demo so pretty
02:00 - much starting from scratch and we're g
02:03 - to use their walkthrough here to get our
02:06 - web map up and running so the first
02:09 - thing is they say to take this
02:13 - HTML and we'll go ahead and paste that
02:17 - in
02:21 - ours that save it
02:25 - okay and now we need to uh reference
02:28 - their API and to reference their API we
02:31 - just take this code here and we paste
02:34 - this into the head of our HTML
02:40 - file and what we just pasted in there
02:43 - was this is a link to their
02:46 - stylesheet and so that will style their
02:49 - map and their map container and things
02:51 - like that and this is their actual
02:54 - Javascript file that's going to give us
02:55 - access to uh to their whole
02:58 - API um
03:00 - so if we keep scrolling down here they
03:03 - also have some other styles that you can
03:05 - add in but we're going to skip that
03:06 - right
03:09 - now so loading modules here
03:13 - um so on you'll see this a lot on their
03:18 - samples uh that they just put these
03:20 - script tags directly into the HTML and
03:24 - that's fine with the samples because
03:25 - they're all small documents but if
03:27 - you're going to be making uh if you're
03:30 - going to be making large applications
03:32 - then it gets too hard to manage all of
03:34 - your HTML and all of your JavaScript in
03:37 - one file so instead of doing what they
03:40 - do here and putting a script
03:44 - tag let's go ahead and make a body of
03:47 - our
03:48 - HTML and put that script tag in there so
03:51 - in instead of putting the script tag in
03:53 - here like they do we are going to take
03:57 - that
03:58 - out
04:02 - and we are going to link to our uh
04:05 - external Javascript file right here and
04:08 - it's in the same folder as our HTML file
04:11 - so all we need to do is Source
04:16 - equals
04:20 - script.js and now in script.js which I
04:23 - have open in this tab right here now we
04:25 - can add in any of the JavaScript code
04:29 - that
04:30 - that uh that they provide for us um so
04:33 - we're actually let's not add this in
04:34 - right now because they give a more
04:36 - complete version down here at the
04:41 - bottom okay let's take this one
04:49 - here and the code that we just added in
04:53 - uh requires the modules that we're going
04:56 - to need for our application so uh this
04:59 - is the path to the module the ezri
05:02 - map and this Dojo Dom ready uh pretty
05:06 - much just make sure that the website is
05:09 - ready to go before we load up our code
05:13 - so that we're not referencing anything
05:15 - that doesn't exist yet um and then this
05:19 - map here that we pass into the function
05:21 - that's just an alias for this ezri map
05:26 - here so we can actually call this
05:27 - whatever we want but you know uh just
05:32 - keep it something that you're going to
05:33 - know what it is so map I think is fine
05:37 - so let's go ahead and move down here to
05:40 - step five create the map so let's
05:47 - take this Global variable from map and
05:50 - paste that in there and then they give
05:52 - some code for the actual map
05:55 - itself
05:56 - copy and we'll paste that right in here
06:00 - where they put their
06:03 - comment and clean up that indentation
06:10 - okay let's scroll down and the last
06:13 - thing that we need to do before this
06:15 - will show up on our web page is to drop
06:18 - this div into our
06:21 - HTML with the ID of mapd and in our
06:26 - JavaScript you can see here um this
06:28 - doesn't have to be named map div in your
06:31 - HTML it's that's just the name that we
06:34 - assigned to it in our JavaScript so we
06:35 - can change that to whatever we want I'm
06:37 - going to STI go ahead and stick with
06:38 - mapd so go back over to our HTML file
06:41 - here and then within our body above the
06:45 - script tag uh put that div
06:48 - ID with the ID of map div and go ahead
06:52 - and save that and let's reload up our
06:54 - web page and see if we see
06:57 - anything okay so we have our our first
07:00 - map working now so um but you can see
07:04 - that it doesn't take up the entire web
07:06 - page uh that's because we haven't added
07:08 - any style or anything to it yet it's
07:10 - just uh extremely basic so let's go
07:12 - ahead and go back to their
07:15 - tutorial and you can see
07:18 - the uh bottom link here is uh style the
07:21 - page and just like I said before with
07:24 - their JavaScript they will also usually
07:27 - drop in uh these end line Styles into
07:30 - the HTML file but just like with the
07:33 - JavaScript we want to uh make that CSS
07:37 - file and external file so that we can
07:39 - manage all that stuff separate from the
07:41 - HTML we don't want to mix and match our
07:44 - HTML and JavaScript and CSS we want all
07:46 - those to be separate so that it's easy
07:48 - to maintain so instead of we don't need
07:51 - this style tag here all we need to do is
07:54 - in the head of our
07:55 - document at the very bottom underneath
07:58 - uh their screen script and stylesheet we
08:02 - can put in our own stylesheet so link
08:07 - with a rail stylesheet and the href is
08:10 - just the styles.css
08:16 - file and save
08:18 - that okay so now we can copy their
08:21 - Styles here without the style
08:24 - tags and paste that directly into our
08:27 - styles.css file
08:30 - and save
08:32 - that and as you can see all that does is
08:36 - gives zero padding zero margin and uh
08:39 - height 100% to our HTML body and the map
08:45 - div and okay now that's uh now we have a
08:49 - full screen map in our web browser and
08:52 - you know zoom in and if we go back you
08:55 - can already start messing with this if
08:56 - you want if we go back to our Javascript
08:58 - file
09:00 - you know this uh uh new map right here
09:04 - had a few options that it already added
09:08 - in so uh for base maps you can change
09:11 - this they have a few different base maps
09:13 - you can use uh but if we change that to
09:16 - Gray and then reload our map over here
09:19 - now we have the gray base map uh you can
09:21 - change the starting Zoom point to five
09:24 - you can change your center location to
09:28 - uh you know a different latitude and
09:31 - longitude and just kind of experiment
09:33 - with it and and see what it does so
09:36 - that's where we're going to end it for
09:37 - part one in the next video we will add
09:40 - some more styles to this map We'll add
09:42 - in a top menu bar here with some buttons
09:44 - so that we can add in some functionality
09:47 - uh put in some more modules so that we
09:50 - can do some more cool stuff with the map
09:52 - so uh definitely check that out and
09:54 - hopefully this was useful for you guys
09:56 - and thanks for watching
