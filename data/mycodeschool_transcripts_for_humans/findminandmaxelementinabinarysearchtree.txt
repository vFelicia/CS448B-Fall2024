With timestamps:

00:00 - In our previous lessons, we wrote some
basic code for binary search tree
00:04 - but to solidify our concepts we need to
write some more code
00:07 - so I have picked this simple problem for
you.
00:11 - Given a binary search tree, we want to find
minimum and maximum
00:15 - element in it. Let's see how we can solve
this problem.
00:18 - I have drawn logical representation of a
binary search tree of integers here.
00:23 - As we know in a binary search tree, for
all nodes
00:26 - value of nodes in left subtree is
lesser
00:29 - and value of nodes in right subtree is
greater.
00:33 - This is how we can define node for
binary search tree in C C++. 
00:37 - We can have a structure with three
fields, one want to store data
00:41 - another to store address of left child
and another to store address of right
00:45 - child.
00:46 - As we had seen earlier in BST implementation
00:49 - identity of the tree that we always keep
with us
00:52 - that we pass to functions is address
of the root node.
00:55 - So what I want to do here is I first want
to write a function named
01:00 - FindMin that should take address of the
root Node as
01:03 - argument and return me the minimum
element in the tree,
01:07 - and just like FindMin we can write
another function named
01:11 - FindMax that can return us the maximum
01:14 - element in BST. Let's first see how the
can find the minimum element.
01:18 - there are two possible approaches here. We
can write
01:21 - an iterative solution in which we can
use a simple loop to find a minimum
01:25 - the element
01:26 - or we can use the recursion. Let's first
see the
01:29 - iterative solution. If we have a pointer
to the root node and we want to find the
01:34 - minimum element in BST,
01:36 - then from root we need to go left as
long as it's possible to go
01:40 - using the left links because in a BST
for
01:44 - all nodes, nodes in left have lesser
value and nodes in right have greater
01:48 - value.
01:49 - So we need to go left as long as it's
possible. We can start with the temporary
01:53 - pointer to root node.
01:54 - We can name this pointer temp or
we can this pointer
01:58 - current to say that we're currently
pointing to this node.
02:01 - In my function here, I have declared this
pointer to BST node
02:04 - named current and initially I'm setting
02:08 - the address of root in it, and with this
pointer
02:11 - we can go to the left child with a
statement like
02:14 - current = current->left. We first
need to check if there is a left child
02:19 - and then we need to move the pointer. We
can use a while loop like this.
02:23 - If the left child of current node is
not null,
02:26 - we can move this pointer current to the
left child with a statement
02:30 - current = current -> left.
02:32 - Here in this example, we are
pointing to this node with value
02:36 - 15.
02:36 - It has a left child so we can move to
this
02:40 - node with value 10. Once again this node too
has a left hand
02:44 - so we can go left again. Now this node with
value 8
02:48 - does not have a left child, so we
cannot go towards left
02:51 - any further. We will come out of the while
loop
02:54 - and at this point the node we are
pointing to has minimum value,
02:59 - so we can return the data in that node.
03:02 - There is one case that we are missing in
this function. If the tree is
03:06 - empty, We can throw some error and we can
return some
03:10 - value indicative of empty tree. If I know
that the tree would have only positive
03:14 - values,
03:15 - I can return something like -1. So here,
in my function have added this condition
03:19 - if the root
03:19 - is equal to null, that is if the tree is
empty
03:23 - print this error and return -1. One more
thing, We do not need to use this extra
03:28 - pointer to BST node named current.
Root, here is our
03:32 - local variable and we can use this root
itself.
03:35 - So we can write our code like this, while
left of root is not equal to null
03:41 - we can go left with the statement 
root = root -> left and finally,
03:45 - we can return root -> data which is only
an alternate syntax for
03:50 - (*root).data. Modifying this local root
03:54 - is not going to modify my root in main
function or
03:57 - whatever function I'm calling this 
FindMin function from.
04:01 - So this our iterative solution to
find minimum element in BST.
04:05 - The logic for finding maximum is
similar.
04:08 - The only difference will be that instead
of going left, we will have to go right
04:12 - all the time.
04:13 - I leave it for you to implement. Let's now
see how we can find
04:17 - minimum element using recursion. If we
want to reduce this problem
04:21 - in a recursive manner, in a
self-similar manner then what we can say
04:25 - is,
04:26 - if the left subtree is not empty then
we can reduce the problem to finding
04:30 - minimum
04:31 - in left subtree. If left subtree is empty
04:35 - we already know the minimum because we
cannot have a minimum in right subtree.
04:40 - Here is the recursion that we can write. Root
being null is a corner case, if root is
04:44 - null
04:45 - that is if the tree is empty, we can throw
error
04:48 - else if left child of root is null
04:51 - we can return the data in root, else if
left child is not null
04:56 - or in other words if the left subtree is
not empty
04:59 - we can to reduce the problem to searching
minimum in the left subtree.
05:03 - So we are making this recursive call to
FindMin
05:06 - passing it address of the left child,
passing it address of
05:10 - the root left subtree. Left child would
be the root of left subtree.
05:15 - This second elseif is our base condition to
exit from recursion.
05:21 - If you had understood the recursion
that we had written earlier to insert a
05:24 - node in BST,
05:26 - then this recursion should not be very
difficult for you to understand.
05:29 - So here is our recursive solution to
find minimum
05:32 - in BST. To find maximum element, all we
need to do is we need to go searching
05:38 - in right subtree. Okay I'll stop here now.
05:41 - In coming Lessons, we will solve some
more interesting problems on BST.
05:45 - Thanks for watching.

Cleaned transcript:

In our previous lessons, we wrote some basic code for binary search tree but to solidify our concepts we need to write some more code so I have picked this simple problem for you. Given a binary search tree, we want to find minimum and maximum element in it. Let's see how we can solve this problem. I have drawn logical representation of a binary search tree of integers here. As we know in a binary search tree, for all nodes value of nodes in left subtree is lesser and value of nodes in right subtree is greater. This is how we can define node for binary search tree in C C++.

If the left child of current node is not null, we can move this pointer current to the left child with a statement current = current > left. Here in this example, we are pointing to this node with value 15. It has a left child so we can move to this node with value 10. Once again this node too has a left hand so we can go left again. Now this node with value 8 does not have a left child, so we cannot go towards left any further. We will come out of the while loop and at this point the node we are pointing to has minimum value, so we can return the data in that node. There is one case that we are missing in this function. If the tree is empty, We can throw some error and we can return some value indicative of empty tree. If I know that the tree would have only positive values, I can return something like 1. So here, in my function have added this condition if the root is equal to null, that is if the tree is empty print this error and return 1. One more thing, We do not need to use this extra pointer to BST node named current. Root, here is our local variable and we can use this root itself. So we can write our code like this, while left of root is not equal to null we can go left with the statement root = root > left and finally, we can return root > data which is only an alternate syntax for (*root).data.
