00:01 - In this lesson, using the example of a very
famous mathematical
00:04 - sequence named Fibonacci sequence, we will
explain why writing a
00:09 - recursive may sometimes be very intuitive
and simple, but it may
00:14 - not be the best thing to do.
00:17 - And the prerequisite for this
00:18 - lesson is that you should know about functions
and you should
00:21 - also know about the concept of recursion in
programming.
00:25 - Now,
00:26 - Fibonacci sequence is defined by this particular
recurrence
00:29 - relation.
00:31 - The first two elements in the sequence are
0 and 1 and
00:36 - all other elements are the sum of previous
two elements.
00:39 - So, the
00:40 - third element is 1+0 which is 1 and then we
go like 1+1 = 2 ,
00:47 - 2+1 = 3 and so on.
00:49 - So, we can also say that this is F(0), and
00:52 - this is F(1) and F(0) and F(1) are calculated
by this condition
00:57 - and F(2) onward, we calculate them by this
recurrence relation.
01:02 - Now, Albert and Pinto are two students of
MyCodeSchool and both
01:07 - have written programs to find out nth element
in the sequence
01:13 - and they have both written two different solutions
and let us
01:16 - see what these two different solutions are.
01:19 - Albert writes a
01:20 - method Fib that takes n as input and gives
F(n) in this above
01:27 - sequence and the program goes like if n is
less than or equal to
01:32 - 1, return n, else we will initialize two variables
F(1) to 0 and
01:39 - F(2) to 1 and run a loop form 2 to n where
I'll have a variable
01:45 - F that will calculate the sum of F1 and F2.
01:49 - F1 and F2 at any
01:50 - point in this loop will have the or rather
store the values of
01:54 - the previous two elements.
01:56 - And F at any stage in this loop will
01:58 - have the current element.
01:59 - Now, we need to update F1 and F2, so
02:02 - F1 now will be F2 and F2 now will be F. And
finally when we come
02:07 - out of this loop, we can return F. And this
gives us pseudo-code
02:12 - for Albert's implementation.
02:14 - Now, Pinto also writes a method
02:16 - Fib(n), but Pinto has recently learnt recursion
and he says that
02:21 - hey, there is lot more simpler method to solve
this problem.
02:25 - So,
02:26 - his program also goes like if n is less than
or equal to 1,
02:29 - return n, but else return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2).
02:37 - So, he writes a
02:38 - recursion and this particular condition , if
n <=1 is the base
02:43 - condition or termination condition so that
the recursion does
02:47 - not go on endlessly.
02:49 - Now, let us quickly try to write these
02:52 - programs in an actual compiler and see what
happens.
02:55 - So, I will
02:57 - write a C++ program and this is a Visual Studio
compiler open in
03:00 - front of you.
03:01 - So, this is Albert's code where he has written
an
03:06 - iterative program where he is iterating through
all F(i)s in a
03:12 - loop from 2 to n and I'll come to the main
method and have a
03:18 - variable n and ask the user to input an n,
so I'll say, hey give
03:25 - me an n.
03:28 - and I'll input this.
03:29 - I'll also have a variable result
03:32 - that will store the return from the function
once we pass n and
03:38 - then i'll simply print the result.
03:41 - Now, let us quickly run this
03:43 - program and see what happens.
03:46 - Now, this says give me an n.
03:48 - Let's
03:49 - say i give n = 6 and the output is 8 which
is correct.
03:53 - Now, i
03:54 - will run this again and this time for an input
40.
03:59 - And this time
04:00 - output is 102334155 which is a 9 digit number.
04:05 - Now, let us write
04:06 - Pinto's implementation and this time I'll
modify this method.
04:10 - So, I'll say that if n is less than or equal
to 1 then , return
04:12 - n, else return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) and we
could also write an
04:24 - else here but that would be redundant.
04:26 - So, let's run this and
04:28 - see what happens.
04:29 - So, this time again , let's say we give the
04:33 - input 6 first.
04:35 - And this gives me 8 which is correct.
04:37 - And let's
04:38 - give n = 40 again.
04:43 - And this is not finished yet.
04:45 - This is still
04:46 - executing.
04:48 - And I am waiting.
04:49 - And this is still executing.
04:52 - And
04:53 - Boom !! It finally comes.
04:54 - So, this gives me the correct result,
04:56 - but this time it takes couple of seconds to
give me the result.
05:00 - And why is it so.
05:02 - I thought recursion is good.
05:04 - Let us see.
05:05 - Now
05:06 - Albert has written an iterative program and
Pinto has written a
05:10 - recursive program.
05:11 - So, what happens with Albert is that to
05:13 - calculate F(n), he already has F(0) and F(1),
so to calculate F
05:18 - (n), he goes on to calculate F(2) from F(0)
and F(1) , and then
05:22 - he goes on to calculate F(3) from F(2) and
F(1) and he goes on
05:25 - till F(n).
05:27 - So, he calculates each of these F(2), F(3)
and F(n)
05:32 - exactly once.
05:33 - So, for example, if he wants to calculate
F(5), he
05:36 - goes on building it like from F(0), sorry
he already has these
05:44 - two values F(0) and F(1), from here he goes
to F(2) and then to
05:50 - F(3), F(4) , all the way till F(5).
05:53 - Now, if Pinto has to
05:54 - calculate F(5), he makes a recursive call
to F(4) and F(3).
05:59 - So,
06:00 - I''ll go in order in which the functions are
called in an actual
06:03 - program.
06:04 - I am using F(4), F(5), all these names as
shortcut for
06:07 - Fib(5) and Fib(4).
06:09 - So, now F(4) recursively calls F(3).
06:12 - F(3)
06:13 - recursively calls F(2) and F(2) recursively
calls F(1) . F(2)
06:18 - also calls F(0).
06:19 - Now F(0) and F(1) do not make any further
06:22 - recursive calls.
06:23 - They simply return 1 and 0 respectively.
06:26 - This also makes a call to F(1) and we keep
on drawing this structure.
06:31 - Now, F(5) also calls F(3).
06:35 - Now this particular structure that we have
drawn here is called a recursion tree.
06:39 - Now, we can see here that the value F(2) is
actually being calculated thrice.
06:47 - And similarly, F(3) is being calculated twice
which is an unnecessary overhead or unnecessary
06:53 - redundancy.
06:54 - So, in the left or the iterative program,
while we are calculating each state or each
07:00 - value of F(i) exactly once, in the recursive
implementation, we are calculating it multiple
07:07 - times.
07:08 - For example, if n = 5, we are calculating
F(2) thrice, when n = 6, we are calculating
07:15 - F(2) 5 times.
07:16 - When n = 8, we calculate F(2) 13 times and
if n =40 that we had used in our example,
07:26 - this number is 63245986 which is crazy.
07:32 - And similarly, like F(2) , F(3), F(4) and
F(i) for any general i is being calculated
07:38 - a number of time.
07:39 - So, the running time of this program is growing
exponentially as the input increases.
07:44 - And you can also write a simple program to
find how many times F(2) is being calculated
07:49 - or any other F(i) is being calculated.
07:52 - So, as we can see from this example, recursion
can sometimes be very simple and intuitive
07:58 - to write, but it could be expensive in terms
of time and space that it takes.
08:04 - In another lesson, we will see how to analyze
the time complexity of a recursive program.
08:11 - In yet another lesson, we will also see that
how to avoid this overhead of calculating
08:16 - the same state again and again by using a
technique called recursion with memoization.
08:22 - So, Thanks for watching !

F1 and F2 at any point in this loop will have the or rather store the values of the previous two elements. And F at any stage in this loop will have the current element. Now, we need to update F1 and F2, so F1 now will be F2 and F2 now will be F. And finally when we come out of this loop, we can return F. And this gives us pseudocode for Albert's implementation. Now, Pinto also writes a method Fib(n), but Pinto has recently learnt recursion and he says that hey, there is lot more simpler method to solve this problem. So, his program also goes like if n is less than or equal to 1, return n, but else return Fib(n1) + Fib(n2).

Now, this says give me an n. Let's say i give n = 6 and the output is 8 which is correct. Now, i will run this again and this time for an input 40. And this time output is 102334155 which is a 9 digit number. Now, let us write Pinto's implementation and this time I'll modify this method. So, I'll say that if n is less than or equal to 1 then , return n, else return Fib(n1) + Fib(n2) and we could also write an else here but that would be redundant. So, let's run this and see what happens. So, this time again , let's say we give the input 6 first. And this gives me 8 which is correct. And let's give n = 40 again. And this is not finished yet. This is still executing. And I am waiting. And this is still executing. And Boom !! It finally comes. So, this gives me the correct result, but this time it takes couple of seconds to give me the result. And why is it so. I thought recursion is good. Let us see. Now Albert has written an iterative program and Pinto has written a recursive program. So, what happens with Albert is that to calculate F(n), he already has F(0) and F(1), so to calculate F (n), he goes on to calculate F(2) from F(0) and F(1) , and then he goes on to calculate F(3) from F(2) and F(1) and he goes on till F(n). So, he calculates each of these F(2), F(3) and F(n) exactly once. So, for example, if he wants to calculate F(5), he goes on building it like from F(0), sorry he already has these two values F(0) and F(1), from here he goes to F(2) and then to F(3), F(4) , all the way till F(5).

Now F(0) and F(1) do not make any further recursive calls. They simply return 1 and 0 respectively. This also makes a call to F(1) and we keep on drawing this structure. Now, F(5) also calls F(3). Now this particular structure that we have drawn here is called a recursion tree. Now, we can see here that the value F(2) is actually being calculated thrice.

For example, if n = 5, we are calculating F(2) thrice, when n = 6, we are calculating F(2) 5 times. When n = 8, we calculate F(2) 13 times and if n =40 that we had used in our example, this number is 63245986 which is crazy.
