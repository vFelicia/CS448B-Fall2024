With timestamps:

00:00 - In our previous lessons, 
we described linked list,
00:04 - we saw the cost of various operations in linked
list and we
00:08 - also compared Linked List with arrays.
00:11 - Now, let us implement Linked List,
 the implementation will be
00:15 - pretty similar in c and c++.
00:17 - there will be slight differences that we will
discuss.
00:22 - the prerequisite for this lesson is that you
should have a
00:24 - working knowledge of pointers in C/C++
and you should also know the concept of dynamic
00:31 - memory allocation.
00:32 - If you want to refresh any of these concepts
check the
00:36 - description of this video for additional resources.
00:39 - Ok so let's get started. As we know in a 
linked list, data is
00:45 - stored in multiple non-contiguous blocks of
memory
00:49 - and we call each block of memory a node in
the linked list.
00:52 - So Let me first draw a linked list here, so
we have a linked
00:57 - list of integers here with three nodes as
we know
01:01 - each node has two fields or two parts one
to store the data and
01:06 - another to store the address of the next node
what
01:09 - we can also call link to the next node.
01:12 - So Let's say the address of the first node
is 200 and address of
01:17 - the second node is 100 and the address of
the third
01:19 - node is 300 for this linked list.
This is only a logical view of the linked
01:25 - list.So the address
part of the first node will be 100 and the
01:29 - address of the
second node will be 200 and we will have 300
01:32 - here.
01:33 - The address part of the last node will be
null which is only a
01:36 - synonym or macro for address 0.
01:40 - 0 is an invalid address a pointer variable
equal to 0 or null
01:45 - with address 0 or null means
that the pointer variable does not point to
01:48 - a valid memory
location.
01:51 - The memory block the address of the memory
block allocated to
01:54 - each of the node is totally random, there
is no relation.
01:58 - Its not a guarantee that the addresses will
be in increasing
02:01 - order or decreasing order or adjacent to each
other.
02:04 - So that's why we need to keep these links.Now
the identity of
02:09 - the linked list that we always keep with us
is
02:12 - the address of the first node what we also
call the head node.
02:17 - So we keep another variable that will be of
type pointer to
02:21 - node and this guy will store the address of
the first node.
02:26 - And we can name this pointer variable whatever
lets say this
02:29 - pointer variable is named A.
The name of this particular pointer variable
02:33 - that points to the
head node or the first node can also be interpreted
02:37 - as the name
for the linked list also
02:40 - because this is the only identity of the linked
list that we
02:43 - keep with us all the time.
So let us now see how this logical view can
02:48 - be mapped to a real
program in C or C++.
02:53 - In our program node will be a data type that
will have two
02:56 - fields.one to store the data and another to
store the address.
03:02 - In C we can define such a datatype as structure,
so lets say we
03:07 - define a structure named node with two fields.
First field to store the data, the type of
03:15 - the data here is
integer so this will be node for a linked
03:19 - list of integers.
03:20 - If we wanted a Linked List of say Double,
this data type would
03:25 - be double.
The second field will be pointer to node struct
03:29 - node*. We can
name this Link or we can name this next or
03:34 - whatever
03:35 - This is C style of declaring node* or pointer
to node.If this
03:39 - was C++ we could simply write Node*.
I would write it this way the C++ way it looks
03:46 - better to me.
03:47 - In our Logical view here this variable A is
of type Node* or
03:54 - pointer to node.
Each of these three rectangles with two fields
03:58 - are of type node
and this field in the node, the first field
04:05 - is of type integer
and second field is of type pointer to node
04:10 - or Node*.
04:12 - It is important to note which one is what
in the logical view.
04:16 - We should have this visualization before we
go on to implement
04:20 - Linked List.
04:22 - OK so Let us now create this particular Linked
List of Integer
04:26 - that we are showing here through our code.To
be able to do so
04:31 - we will have to implement two
operations one to insert a node into the Linked
04:36 - List.
04:37 - One operation to insert a node in to Linked
List and another
04:40 - operation to traverse the Linked List.
But before that the first thing that we want
04:45 - to do is that we
want to declare a pointer to the head node,
04:49 - a variable that will store the address of
the head node.
04:52 - For the sake of clarity i will write head
node here.So I have
04:56 - declared a pointer to node named A.
Initially When the list is empty, when there
05:03 - is no element in
the list. This pointer should point no where.
05:07 - So we write a statement something like A is
equal to Null to
05:12 - say this same.With these two statements what
we have done is
05:15 - we have created a pointer to node named A
and this pointer
05:19 - points No-where so the list is empty.
05:22 - Now Lets say we want to insert a node in this
list so what we
05:25 - do is we first create a node.Creating a node
is nothing but
05:30 - creating a memory block to store a node.
05:33 - In C we use the function malloc to create
a memory block as
05:39 - argument we pass the number of bytes that
we want in the block.
05:42 - So we say that give me a memory block that
will be equal to the
05:46 - size of a node.
05:47 - So this call to malloc will create a memory
block.This is
05:54 - dynamically allocated memory,memory allocated
during runtime
05:57 - and
the only way to work with this kind of memory
06:00 - is through
reference to this memory location through
06:04 - pointers.
06:05 - Let us assume that this memory block assigned
here is at
06:07 - address 200.
06:09 - Now malloc returns a void pointer that gives
us the address of
06:13 - assigned memory block so we need to collect
it in some
06:17 - variable.
Lets say we create a variable named temp which
06:20 - is pointer to
node so we can collect the return of malloc
06:24 - the address in this
particular
06:26 - variable.
06:27 - We will need a type casting here because malloc
returns void
06:30 - pointer and we are having temp as pointer
to node
06:34 - So now we have created one node in the memory.
06:38 - Now what we need to do is fill in the data
in this particular
06:42 - node and adjust the links which will mean
writing the
06:46 - correct address in the variable A and the
link field of this
06:51 - newly created node.
06:52 - To do so we will have to de-reference this
particular pointer
06:56 - variable that we just created.
06:59 - As we know if we put a * sign in front of
the pointer
07:03 - variable.We mean de-referencing it to modify
the value at that
07:08 - particular address.
Now in this case we have a node which has
07:11 - two fields,so once we
de-reference if we want to access each of
07:16 - the fields
we need to put something like a dot data here
07:19 - to access the
data and a dot link to write to the link field.
07:24 - So we will write a statement like this to
fill in value 2 here
07:28 - and we have this temp variable pointing to
this
07:31 - right now and link part of this newly created
node should be
07:36 - null because this is the first and the last
node.
07:42 - And the final thing that we need to do is
write the address of
07:45 - this newly created node in A.
07:49 - So we will write something like A is equal
to temp. Ok temp was
07:54 - to temporarily store the address of the node
till the time we
07:57 - have
not fixed all the links properly. We can now
08:00 - use temp for some
other purpose.Our linked list is intact now
08:05 - it has one node.
08:07 - These two lines that we have written here
for de-referencing
08:10 - and writing the value into the new node.There
is alternate
08:15 - syntax for this
Instead of writing something like *temp bracketed
08:20 - dot data we
could also write temp followed by this arrow
08:25 - and data.we will have two characters to make
this arrow one
08:29 - hyphen and one this right angular brace.
08:35 - So we can write something like this.And same
thing below we can
08:38 - write something like this.To create a memory
block in C++ we
08:45 - can use malloc as well
as we can use the new operator.
08:48 - So in C++ it gets very simple.We could simply
write Node* temp
08:54 - = new Node like this and we would mean
the same thing. this is a lot cleaner and
09:01 - new operator is
always preferred over malloc. So if you are
09:05 - using C++ new is
recommended.
09:09 - So far through our program we created an empty
list by creating
09:13 - this pointer to the head node and assigning
the value null to
09:16 - it initially then
we created a node and we added first node
09:22 - in this linked
list.When the list is empty and we want to
09:25 - insert a node the
logic
09:27 - is pretty straight forward.
09:29 - When the list is not empty we may want to
insert a node at the
09:32 - beginning of the list or we may want to insert
a node at
09:35 - the end of the list or we may even want to
insert a node
09:39 - somewhere in the middle of the list at a particular
position.
09:42 - we will write separate functions and routines
for these
09:46 - different kind of insertions and we will see
running code in a
09:50 - compiler in our coming lessons.
Lets just talk about the logic here in this
09:56 - whatever
unstructured code i have right now here.
09:59 - So i want to write a code to insert two more
nodes each time at
10:04 - the end of the list.we actually want to create
the
10:07 - linked list with three nodes having values
2,4 and 6 that was
10:13 - our initial example in the beginning.
10:16 - Ok So let us add two more nodes with values
4 and 6 in to this
10:20 - linked list.At this stage in our code we already
have a
10:23 - variable temp which is
pointing to this particular node We will create
10:27 - a new node and
use the same variable name to collect the
10:31 - address of this new
node.
10:32 - So we will write a statement like this.So
a new node is created
10:35 - and temp now stores the address of this new
node which is
10:38 - located at
address 100 here.Once again you can set the
10:41 - data.And then
because this is going to be the last node
10:44 - we need to set the
link as null.
10:47 - Now all we need to do is to build the link
of this particular
10:50 - node,Write the address of this newly created
node in to the
10:54 - address field of
this last node.To do so we will have to traverse
10:58 - the list and
we will have to go to the end of the list,
11:01 - to do so we will
write something like this.
11:03 - We can create a new variable temp1 which will
be pointer to
11:07 - node and initially we can point this variable
to the head node
11:11 - by a statement like this.
we can write a loop like this. Now this is
11:16 - generic logic to
reach the end of the list.
11:18 - It will be not so clear if we see this logic
with only one node
11:22 - as we have in this example. Lets draw a list
with multiple
11:25 - nodes.
So we are pointing temp1 to the first node
11:28 - here and if the link
part of this node is null then we are at last
11:31 - node else we can
move to the next node.
11:35 - So temp1 equal to temp1-> link will get us
to the next node.And
11:39 - we will go on till we reach the last node.
For the last node this particular condition
11:46 - temp1->link not
equal to null will be false because the link
11:50 - part will be null
and we will exit this while loop.
11:53 - So this is our code logic for traversal of
the list all the way
11:58 - till end.If we want to print the element in
the list we will
12:01 - write something like this, we will write
print temp->data inside the while loop.But
12:07 - right now we want to
insert at the end of the list and we are only
12:11 - traversing the
list to reach the last node.
12:13 - There is one more thing that i want to point
out, we are using
12:17 - this variable temp1 and initially storing
the address in A
12:21 - we are not doing something like A equal A.link
and using the
12:25 - variable A itself to traverse the list because
if we modify
12:29 - A we will loose the address of the head node.
12:32 - So A is never modified, the address of the
head node whatever
12:35 - variable stores the address of the head node
is never
12:37 - modified.Only this temporary variables are
modified to traverse
12:41 - the list.So finally after all this we will
write a statement
12:45 - like this temp1 dot link
is equal to temp. temp1 is now pointing here
12:50 - so this address
part is updated and this link is built.
12:54 - So we have two nodes in the list Once again
if we want to
12:59 - insert node with number 6 in this list we
will have to create a
13:03 - new node by this
logic and then we will have to traverse the
13:07 - list by this
logic.So We will point temp1 here first.Then
13:11 - the loop will move
the temp1 to the end.
13:14 - Lets say this new block is at address 300.So
this Last line
13:17 - finally will adjust the link of the node at
address 100.To
13:22 - insert the node at the end
there is one logic in these four line if this
13:27 - list is empty and
another logic in these remaining lines if
13:31 - list is not empty.
13:33 - Ideally, we will be writing all this logic
in a function. we will
13:39 - do that in our coming lessons. We will implement
a separate
13:42 - methods to print all
the element in the list or insert a node at
13:45 - the end or we will
implement a separate method to insert a node
13:49 - at beginning of
the list
13:51 - and at a particular position in the list.
This is all for this
13:54 - lesson. Thanks for watching.

Cleaned transcript:

In our previous lessons, we described linked list, we saw the cost of various operations in linked list and we also compared Linked List with arrays. Now, let us implement Linked List, the implementation will be pretty similar in c and c++. there will be slight differences that we will discuss. the prerequisite for this lesson is that you should have a working knowledge of pointers in C/C++ and you should also know the concept of dynamic memory allocation. If you want to refresh any of these concepts check the description of this video for additional resources. Ok so let's get started. As we know in a linked list, data is stored in multiple noncontiguous blocks of memory and we call each block of memory a node in the linked list. So Let me first draw a linked list here, so we have a linked list of integers here with three nodes as we know each node has two fields or two parts one to store the data and another to store the address of the next node what we can also call link to the next node. So Let's say the address of the first node is 200 and address of the second node is 100 and the address of the third node is 300 for this linked list. This is only a logical view of the linked list.So the address part of the first node will be 100 and the address of the second node will be 200 and we will have 300 here. The address part of the last node will be null which is only a synonym or macro for address 0. 0 is an invalid address a pointer variable equal to 0 or null with address 0 or null means that the pointer variable does not point to a valid memory location. The memory block the address of the memory block allocated to each of the node is totally random, there is no relation. Its not a guarantee that the addresses will be in increasing order or decreasing order or adjacent to each other. So that's why we need to keep these links.Now the identity of the linked list that we always keep with us is the address of the first node what we also call the head node. So we keep another variable that will be of type pointer to node and this guy will store the address of the first node. And we can name this pointer variable whatever lets say this pointer variable is named A. The name of this particular pointer variable that points to the head node or the first node can also be interpreted as the name for the linked list also because this is the only identity of the linked list that we keep with us all the time. So let us now see how this logical view can be mapped to a real program in C or C++.

OK so Let us now create this particular Linked List of Integer that we are showing here through our code.To be able to do so we will have to implement two operations one to insert a node into the Linked List. One operation to insert a node in to Linked List and another operation to traverse the Linked List. But before that the first thing that we want to do is that we want to declare a pointer to the head node, a variable that will store the address of the head node.

So this is our code logic for traversal of the list all the way till end.If we want to print the element in the list we will write something like this, we will write print temp>data inside the while loop.But right now we want to insert at the end of the list and we are only traversing the list to reach the last node.

Ideally, we will be writing all this logic in a function. we will do that in our coming lessons. We will implement a separate methods to print all the element in the list or insert a node at the end or we will implement a separate method to insert a node at beginning of the list and at a particular position in the list. This is all for this lesson. Thanks for watching.
