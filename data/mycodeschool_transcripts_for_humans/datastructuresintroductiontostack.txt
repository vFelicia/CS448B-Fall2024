00:00 - In this lesson we're going to introduce
you to stack data structure.
00:04 - Data structures, as we know, are ways to
store and organize data in computers.
00:10 - So far, in the series we have discussed
some of the data structures.
00:13 - We have talked about arrays and linked
lists.
00:17 - Now in this lesson we are going to
talk about stacks and we are going to talk
00:21 - about
00:21 - stack as abstract data type or
00:24 - ADT. When we talk about a data structure
as
00:28 - abstract data type, we talk only about
the features
00:32 - or operations available with the data
structure.
00:35 - We do not go into implementation details.
So basically we define the data
00:40 - structured only as a mathematical or
logical model.
00:43 - We'll go into implementation of stack in
later lessons.
00:48 - In this lesson, we're going to talk only
about stack
00:51 - ADT. So we are only going to have a look at
the logical view
00:55 - of stack. Stack as a data structure in
computer science is not very different
01:00 - from stack as a way of organizing objects,
01:04 - in real world. Here are some examples of
stack from real world:
01:08 - First figure is of a stack of dinner
plates.
01:12 - Second figure is of a mathematical
puzzle, called
01:15 - tower of hanoi, where we have three rods or
three pegs and multiple disks
01:20 - and the game is about moving a stack of
discs,
01:23 - from one peg to another with this
constraint that,
01:27 - a disc can not go on top of a smaller
disc.
01:31 - Third figure is of a pack of Tennis balls.
01:34 - Stack basically is a collection with
this property, that
01:38 - an item in the stack must be inserted
or removed,
01:42 - from the same end that we call the top
of stack.
01:46 - In fact this is not just a property, this
is a constraint or restriction.
01:50 - Only the top of a stack is accessible and
any item has to be inserted
01:56 - or removed from the top. A stack is
also called
02:00 - 'last in first out' collection. Most
02:03 - recently added item in a stack has to go
out first.
02:06 - In the first example, you will always
pick up a
02:10 - dinner plate from top of the stack and
if you will have to put
02:13 - a plate back into the stack, you will
always put it back on
02:17 - top of the stack. You can argue, that I
can slip out a plate
02:21 - from in between without actually
removing the plates on the top.
02:25 - So the constraint that I should take
out a plate always from the top
02:29 - is not strictly enforced. For the sake of
argument,
02:33 - this is fine. You can say this. In other
two examples where we have
02:37 - discs in a pag, and tennis balls in this
02:41 - box that can open only from one side,
there is no way you can take out an item
02:45 - from in between.
02:46 - Any insertion of removal has to happen
from
02:50 - top.
02:52 - You can not slip out an item from in
between. You can take out an item,
02:55 - but for that you will have to remove all
the items on top of that item.
03:00 - Let's now formally define stack as an
abstract data tape.
03:03 - A stack is a list or collection with the
restriction that insertion
03:09 - and deletion can be performed only from
one
03:12 - end, that we call the top of stack. Let's
now define the interface or operations
03:18 - available with
03:18 - stack ADT. There are two fundamental
operations available with a stack.
03:23 - An insertion is called a 'push' operation.
03:27 - 'push' operation can insert or push some
item
03:30 - 'X' onto the stack. Another operation,
second operation is
03:35 - called 'pop'. 'pop' is removing the
03:39 - most recent item from the stack,
most recent element from the stack.
03:43 - 'push' and 'pop' are the fundamental
operations and
03:47 - there can be few more. Typically there is
one operation called
03:50 - 'top', that simply returns the element at
top of the stack.
03:55 - And there can be an operation to check
wheather
03:58 - a stack is empty or not. So this
operation will
04:02 - return true if the stack is empty, false
otherwise.
04:06 - So 'push' is inserting an element on top
of stack
04:09 - and 'pop' is removing an element from
top of stack.
04:13 - We can 'push' or 'pop' only one element at a
time.
04:17 - All these operations that have written
here can be performed
04:20 - in constant time, or in other words their
time complexity
04:25 - is O(1). Remember
04:28 - an element that is pushed or
inserted last on to a stack,
04:32 - is popped or removed first. So stack is
called
04:36 - 'last in first out' structure, what goes in
last comes out first.
04:41 - 'last in first out', in short is called
'LIFO'.
04:45 - Logically a stack is represented
something like this:
04:48 - As a three sided figure, as a container
04:52 - open from one side. This is representation
of an
04:56 - empty stack. Let's name this stack 's'.
Let's say this figure
05:00 - is representing a stack of integers.
05:03 - Right now the stack is empty. I will
perform push and pop operations
05:08 - to insert and remove integers from the
stack.
05:11 - I will first write down the operations here and
then show you
05:14 - what will happen in the logical
representation. Let's first perform
05:18 - a 'push'. I want to 'push' number 2 on to
the stack.
05:22 - The stack is empty right now, so we
can not
05:26 - 'pop' anything. After the 'push', stack will look
something like this:
05:29 - There is only one integer in the stack, so
of course
05:33 - its on 'top'. Let's 'push' another integer.
05:37 - This time, I want to 'push' number 10.
05:40 - And now lets say we want to perform
05:44 - a 'pop'. The integer at 'top' right now is
05:47 - 10. With a 'pop', it will be removed from
the stack.
05:51 - Let's do few more 'push'. I just pushed
7 and 5 onto the stack.
06:02 - At this stage, if I will call 'top'
operation,
06:05 - it will return me number 5. 'IsEmpty'
06:09 - will return me false. At this stage,
06:12 - a 'pop' will remove 5 from the stack.
06:16 - As you can see the element, the
integer which is coming last,
06:20 - is going out first, That's why we call
stack 'last in first out' data structure.
06:25 - We can 'pop' till the stack gets empty.
06:29 - One more 'pop', and stack will be empty.
06:35 - So this pretty much is stack data
structure. Now one obvious question can
06:40 - be
06:40 - what are the real scenarios where stack
06:43 - helps us. Let's list down some of the
applications of stack.
06:47 - Stack data structure is used for
execution of function calls in a program.
06:52 - We have talked about this quite a bit in
our lessons on dynamic memory allocation
06:56 - and linked lists.
06:58 - We can also say that stack is used for
recursion, because
07:02 - recursion is also a chain of function
calls. It's just that,
07:06 - all the calls are to the same function.
To know more about this application, you
07:10 - can
07:11 - check the description of this video,
for a link to 'MyCodeSchool'
07:15 - lesson on dynamic memory allocation.
07:17 - Another application of stack is we can
use it
07:21 - to implement undo operation,
07:24 - in an editor. We can perform undo
operation in
07:27 - any text editor or image editor. Right now,
I'm pressing 'Ctrl Z',
07:32 - and as you can see some of the text
that I have written, is getting cleared.
07:36 - You can implement this using a stack.
07:40 - Stack is used in a number of important
algorithms,
07:44 - like for example a compiler verifies
whether
07:48 - parentheses in a source code are
balanced or not
07:51 - using Stack data structure. Corresponding
to
07:54 - each opening curly brace or opening
parentheses in a source code, there
07:58 - must be
07:59 - a closing parentheses at appropriate
position.
08:02 - And if parentheses in a source code are
not put properly, if they're not balanced,
08:07 - compiler should throw error and this check can be
performed using a stack.
08:12 - We will discuss some of these problems
in detail in coming lessons.
08:16 - This much is good for an introduction. In
our next lesson we will discuss
08:20 - implementation of stack. This is it for
this lesson.
08:24 - Thanks for watching!!
