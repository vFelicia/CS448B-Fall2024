00:01 - in this lesson we will see how to convert a
number from decimal number system
00:05 - to binary number system
00:07 - now converting a number from decimal to binary is essentially
00:10 - finding all the digits of the number in its
00:13 - binary representation
00:15 - let us first see how to find the digits of a number in its
00:18 - decimal presentation and then
00:20 - we will come back to binary
00:22 - so if i write a number in decimal number
system the right most digit corresponds
00:26 - to one's position
00:27 - and then we have tens position hundreds
position and we go on in powers of ten
00:31 - now if i write a number in
00:34 - decimal number systems say for example
00:36 - hundred and twenty five
00:37 - then let's look at it this way
00:39 - one twenty five is actually got
00:41 - one twenty five ones
00:44 - but we do not write all these ones into
the ones column
00:47 - but we do is actually
00:48 - take out
00:49 - all the tens from these ones and keep only the remaining ones in the ones
00:53 - column
00:53 - so we say that
00:55 - one thirty five ones is actually test
ends
00:57 - and fight once and only
00:59 - this five goes to the once called him
01:01 - begin because i keep all the strength
and simple depends column so
01:05 - we take out
01:06 - while the hundred suck at this
01:08 - and keep a lid that you meaning dents in
the dance club
01:12 - school is here
01:14 - no he cannot take part powell's and out
of this one hundred sought at this one
01:18 - hundred
01:18 - actually close to two hundred school
01:21 - so if i have the number
01:23 - one twenty five
01:24 - if i divided but then
01:26 - i get
01:27 - trellis quotient excuse me
01:29 - the number of danced
01:31 - finest amanda that gets me that in many
months
01:35 - and effective go presidents
01:38 - finnegan division bike then gives this
one at school shinde which is the number
01:41 - of hundreds
01:42 - and to elicit amended which is the
number of symington ps
01:45 - not dividing one bite and gets a single
which is the number of paul's ends
01:49 - and again one in the commander of it is
the number ralph
01:52 - hundreds now if you can see this war
trusses is actually giving bus on the
01:56 - desert softer number starting from
01:58 - that act was to get
02:00 - to the left most urgent and if people in
the demands upon them from bottom to top
02:04 - beget the number
02:06 - what are the the deserts of the number
from left to right if we say that this
02:09 - leftmost column isbn
02:11 - than the portion can be obtained
02:15 - and biked and and picking up one indeed
look like a fake and the demand it can
02:19 - be achieved by performing in and want to
look down
02:23 - now if you can see then began acting a
device to neglect the miracle converter
02:26 - numbered n
02:28 - pilates
02:29 - but we should say
02:30 - actually to find out all the dates of
the number
02:34 - novel who quickly like a pseudo code for
this
02:38 - pride in that period
02:39 - find deserts in decimal
02:41 - backfill
02:42 - taken input and give me
02:44 - a list of for the business
02:47 - the decimal representation of the number
02:51 - david stark bataan empty list
02:54 - and even keep filling the list as we
find out of the desserts
02:57 - so this list in an actual program
03:01 - and i don't think the ages of and had a
rough connector or whatever suits you
03:05 - and program close like
03:07 - while any discrepancy at all
03:09 - befall them our deal bipin and store the
value
03:12 - never even called him and uh...
03:14 - not this commander is actually
03:16 - that does it
03:18 - in the first called the rightmost eject
03:22 - at this stage it to the list
03:24 - so would say that this does not list
03:26 - system and uh...
03:27 - now did you send to
03:29 - and biked and then if and is an integer
this one of us give us the portions
03:34 - when we get out of this loop beget
03:36 - and they stop all the biz itself the
number in its decimal form
03:39 - but to get this list from right to left
03:42 - handed out the number from left to right
so
03:45 - decode divorce the latest to get the
number
03:49 - well it or the deserts from
03:51 - left or right sort of say that could
reverse the list
03:54 - knockin putting a number from testimony
combined that he is nothing but finding
03:58 - out all the deserts of the number
04:00 - and it's finally the presentation
04:02 - now as we know in a pine tree number
type most digital response to one's
04:05 - position and in the house tools for
states petition and equal on increasing
04:10 - powersoft too
04:11 - so one of the deserts repeated or
something similar to what the abandoned
04:15 - left
04:18 - or other create two columns here
04:20 - quotient
04:21 - and amanda
04:23 - now we start with two hundred and ninety
five so initially we have hundred and
04:26 - twenty-five once
04:27 - but because i keep all these months into
the ones column
04:30 - so we take out all the pillows
04:31 - and this time we need to divide bechtel
to take a call that goes to this gives
04:35 - us the portion cassese
04:36 - sixty two oh two was and remaining one
once
04:40 - not this one
04:41 - goes to loved ones petition here
04:44 - in behalf sixty photos so we need to
take a look at the force from this would
04:47 - be a game to i'd like to
04:49 - pretty blunt force and remaining
04:53 - and this goes to the plus column and
igor like this
04:59 - so if they see that this particular
column the leftmost condoms and then the
05:03 - portion can be completed s and bike too
05:06 - and people into thinking that part of it
05:08 - and to demand that can be completed by n
modelo too
05:12 - and we can keep on
05:14 - going and feeling the deserts from back
to left
05:25 - and p stop once the
05:27 - get unsettling the cautioned
05:29 - so now we can see that the demand data
from bought them cooktop is actually
05:32 - giving us
05:33 - while the desert softer
05:34 - nobody makes by nearly the presentation
05:37 - so they can say that the number two
hundred and twenty-five and
05:40 - based and
05:41 - exactly
05:43 - one one
05:44 - one one
05:45 - ones that are one and by new york bistro
05:48 - well it's good to write a program for
this as well
05:50 - the program is pretty similar to
05:52 - finding the desert in decimal except
that this time they're finding because
05:55 - it's in binary submitted that
05:57 - find is it's invited me
06:00 - but if it suits you better be built
06:02 - the new internet address that some of
the bank
06:07 - v video game starts with an empty list
06:10 - and try to fill this up for the deserts
in the binary file
06:13 - and this time to say that one and mister
clinton's middle
06:17 - calculate the demand uh... by
06:19 - performing a model bike too
06:22 - and then
06:23 - had this to the list
06:28 - and the standard use and to entitled
06:31 - and if anything did you discuss esta
cautioned
06:34 - finally
06:35 - p again give us the list because
06:38 - the need is it's from left to right
06:41 - so this pretty much gets a support gun
but the numbers from dismantled by nidhi
06:45 - and thus the look fine put on positive
integers end is equal to zero tolerance
06:50 - however especially cases which we have
mark and then
06:54 - because in back is the list will remain
06:56 - and because a controlling about calling
too personal
06:59 - heated to handle it
07:00 - gracefully in york
07:02 - actually program and i'll leave it for
you to do it
07:05 - not this also gives us but genetic about
on
07:09 - kind off the typical are going to find
out number
07:12 - in any base b
07:14 - so if you want a converted number from
testament to be speed
07:17 - well you have to do with the steel
sticking them why do you like to hear
07:20 - and division by two
07:22 - head of the divide by the number of
being taken money no baby
07:26 - and this will give us
07:28 - the number
07:29 - in any basically
07:32 - you should be good
07:33 - so thanks for watching
