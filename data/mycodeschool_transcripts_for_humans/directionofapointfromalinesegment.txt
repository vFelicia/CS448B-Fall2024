00:00 - hi there and welcome to another geometry
00:02 - video in the series maths for
00:04 - programmers previously in this series we
00:07 - saw how to calculate the area of a
00:09 - polygon using the concept of vector
00:12 - cross product in this video will once
00:15 - again use the concept of vector cross
00:16 - product to solve another fundamental
00:18 - problem in geometry how to find the
00:21 - direction of a point from a line segment
00:23 - so let's say I have a line segment a B
00:26 - and a point P what we want to know is if
00:31 - we're traveling along the line segment
00:33 - from A to B so I'll draw an arrow in
00:34 - this direction to indicate the direction
00:37 - in which we are moving so if we're
00:38 - moving from A to B we want to know
00:41 - whether P is to our left which raised in
00:43 - this case or whether P is to our right
00:47 - the point P doesn't have to lie between
00:50 - a and B so here we have a point P which
00:53 - actually lies much behind the line
00:55 - segment AP however this point still
00:57 - counts as being to the right of the line
00:59 - segment a B similarly we could have
01:02 - another point P Prime
01:03 - that is located much after the line
01:05 - segment a B however this point is also
01:08 - considered to be on the right of the
01:10 - line segment a B what we are trying to
01:12 - say is that if we extend this line
01:14 - segment infinitely in both directions
01:16 - and we are still traveling in the
01:19 - general direction of line segment a B
01:21 - then any point in this half will be
01:24 - considered to be on the left of the line
01:27 - segment and any point in this bottom
01:29 - half would be considered to be on the
01:32 - right of the line segment a B this is a
01:34 - very fundamental problem and is commonly
01:37 - encountered for example when giving
01:39 - directions in an online map so let's say
01:42 - we have a user at Point a who actually
01:45 - wants to reach the point C now a good
01:49 - set of directions to give this user
01:51 - would be to ask him to first reach point
01:53 - B and then take a right turn in order to
01:56 - reach point C how do we know that the
01:59 - user has to take a right turn at B and
02:01 - not a left turn well this is because the
02:04 - Point C lies to the right of line
02:06 - segment a B knowing the direction of a
02:10 - point from a line segment also acts as
02:12 - the building
02:13 - to solve more complicated problems such
02:16 - as finding if two line segments
02:17 - intersect and also finding the convex
02:20 - hull of a set of points so we have with
02:23 - us two points a and B which together
02:26 - represent the line segment a B and we
02:29 - also have a Third Point P and we need to
02:32 - tell whether P is to the left of a B or
02:34 - to the right in order to do that we
02:36 - first need to fix a mathematical
02:38 - representation for the points a B and P
02:41 - so we will first use a coordinate system
02:44 - now the choice the coordinate system is
02:46 - very important and can make it difficult
02:48 - or easy depending on your choice to
02:50 - solve the problem for most
02:52 - two-dimensional problems and this is a
02:54 - two dimensional problem
02:56 - choosing the Cartesian plane as the
02:59 - coordinate system is a natural choice
03:00 - and also a good choice so let's draw
03:03 - this diagram on an arbitrary Cartesian
03:05 - plane so in this plane we have two
03:08 - perpendicular axes x and y and we also
03:11 - have numbers marked along both axes to
03:13 - help us identify the coordinate value of
03:15 - point so in order to represent the point
03:18 - a we can simply use its x coordinate
03:20 - value which is say roughly minus 30 and
03:23 - its y coordinate value which is say
03:25 - roughly plus 10 so in this case we can
03:29 - say x is minus 30 comma 10 similarly the
03:32 - rough coordinate values for B would be
03:34 - say 29 comma minus 15 and P can be
03:37 - represented mathematically as the order
03:39 - 15 comma 28 as we said at the beginning
03:43 - of this video we want to use the concept
03:45 - of cross product from vector algebra to
03:47 - solve this problem and now that we have
03:50 - a mathematical representation of all the
03:51 - points we can proceed to use the cross
03:54 - product however cross product can only
03:56 - be applied to a pair of vectors at a
03:58 - time and here we have three points so
04:01 - what we can do is let's just ignore the
04:03 - point a for now now we're left with only
04:05 - two points B and P so let's take the
04:08 - cross product of B and P so B cross P
04:12 - mathematically is equal to the x
04:14 - coordinate of B into the y coordinate of
04:17 - P minus the y coordinate of B into the x
04:20 - coordinate of P now the cross product is
04:24 - an interesting property
04:26 - let's label the origin of the coordinate
04:28 - system the point where the X as well as
04:31 - the Y coordinates have a value of zero
04:33 - as o or the origin and now let's draw
04:36 - the angle B or P now the cross product
04:40 - is positive if and only if this angle is
04:43 - counterclockwise and conversely the
04:46 - cross product is negative if and only if
04:49 - this angle is clockwise we can quickly
04:52 - verify it for this given example here we
04:55 - can quite clearly see that the angle bo
04:57 - P is counterclockwise so we expect the
05:01 - cross product to be positive and if we
05:03 - calculate the value of the cross product
05:05 - it comes up to be 1037 which is indeed
05:09 - positive let's wipe that out and let's
05:12 - extend the line segment we'll be
05:14 - infinitely in both directions now we can
05:17 - make an interesting observation any
05:19 - point P that is in this upper half if we
05:23 - notice the angle this point makes with
05:25 - the line segment bo so if we take B or P
05:27 - for any point that is in this upper half
05:30 - the angle will be counterclockwise which
05:33 - means the value of the cross product is
05:35 - going to be positive similarly if we
05:38 - look at any point in this lower half the
05:41 - angle that this point makes so if you
05:43 - take bo P for a point that is in this
05:45 - lower half the angle will always be
05:48 - clockwise which means the expected value
05:51 - of the cross product will be negative
05:53 - now suppose that we had a line segment
05:56 - ap where a was at the origin of the
05:59 - coordinate system now we can just remove
06:01 - this o and replace it by a without
06:03 - making any difference anywhere and now
06:05 - let's say we're traveling in the
06:06 - direction of AP we can see quite clearly
06:09 - that the points P that have a positive
06:12 - cross product where B cross P is
06:14 - positive are exactly the same points
06:17 - that are to the left of a B and the
06:20 - points that have a negative cross
06:22 - product are nothing but those points
06:24 - which are to the right of a B so given a
06:27 - line segment a B and a point P if a
06:30 - happens to be at the origin of the
06:32 - corner system we can find out the
06:34 - direction of P very easily we can simply
06:37 - take the cross product B
06:38 - P and if it's positive that means P is
06:41 - to the left of a B and if it's negative
06:43 - that means P is to the right if we now
06:46 - go back to our original problem where we
06:49 - have a line segment a B where is not at
06:51 - the origin how can we go about solving
06:53 - this problem well a simple solution is
06:56 - to translate the coordinate system so
06:59 - that the origin lies exactly at a to do
07:03 - this we can subtract the coordinate
07:04 - values of a from all three points a B
07:07 - and P of course when we subtract a from
07:09 - itself we get zero which is why a
07:11 - becomes the origin and when we complete
07:14 - the translation we will have values for
07:17 - P as 45 comma 18 and the value for B as
07:20 - 59 comma minus 25 since a is now at the
07:24 - origin to decide whether P is to the
07:27 - left of the line segment a B or to the
07:28 - right we can simply compute the cross
07:31 - product B cross B and if it is positive
07:34 - we will know that B is to the left which
07:36 - it is in this case or if it is negative
07:38 - we know that B is to the right one
07:41 - interesting case that we haven't
07:43 - explored is what happens when the cross
07:46 - product is exactly zero in that case P
07:49 - is neither to the left nor to the right
07:51 - of line segment a P in fact if we were
07:53 - to extend line segment a B in both
07:55 - directions infinitely then P would be
07:57 - lying somewhere along this line now
08:00 - let's take a look at some C++ code that
08:03 - finds the direction of a point from a
08:05 - line segment the first thing we need to
08:07 - do is figure out how to represent a
08:09 - point in our program and since C++ is an
08:12 - object-oriented language a good decision
08:14 - is to use a struct or a class so we'll
08:17 - declare a struct called point that has
08:19 - two member variables x and y and these
08:22 - of course represent the x and y
08:24 - coordinates of the point itself notice
08:27 - that we use the double data type to
08:28 - store the x and y because the
08:31 - coordinates of a point can have any real
08:33 - number as it their value not necessarily
08:35 - just integers since we talked about left
08:38 - and right directions in the program a
08:41 - lot let's declare some constants so that
08:43 - we don't have to use strings everywhere
08:44 - so here we declare three integers as
08:47 - constants one to represent the left
08:50 - direction
08:51 - to represent the right direction and the
08:53 - third one for the case when the point is
08:56 - exactly on the line okay now we will
08:58 - declare a function called get direction
09:00 - which takes the three points a B and is
09:03 - P as input a and B of course represent
09:06 - the line segment a B and P is the point
09:08 - whose direction we want to know and this
09:11 - function will return an int and this
09:13 - integer would be one of these three
09:14 - constants left right around the line to
09:17 - mean that P is either to the left of a B
09:19 - or to the right of a B or exactly on the
09:22 - line containing the line segment a B
09:24 - since the point a may not necessarily
09:26 - lie on the origin the first thing we
09:29 - need to do is subtract the value of
09:30 - point a from point B and P as us now we
09:34 - don't know how to do subtraction but
09:36 - let's just assume that a function
09:37 - subtract exists which can solve our
09:39 - problem so in that case we can just do
09:41 - something like this we can say B is
09:43 - equal to subtract of B comma a we'll
09:46 - take this to mean that B is B minus a
09:49 - there should exist a function called
09:52 - subtract which given two points returns
09:54 - the second point subtracted from the
09:56 - first point similarly we can also say P
09:59 - is equal to subtract of P comma a so at
10:02 - this point in our program we now are in
10:04 - a situation where both B and P have been
10:07 - translated by the value of a and a is
10:10 - effectively now at the origin so now we
10:13 - need to calculate the cross product of B
10:15 - and P we need to calculate B cross B
10:17 - just like we assumed that there is a
10:19 - function called subtract we'll also
10:21 - assume that there is a function that can
10:23 - get us the cross product of B comma P so
10:26 - then we can write some code like this we
10:28 - can say cross product is equal to the
10:30 - value of B cross P and we'll assume that
10:34 - another function called get browse
10:35 - product exists which will compute P
10:38 - cross P for us the remaining part of the
10:40 - code is now quite simple if the cross
10:43 - product is greater than zero then we
10:45 - know that P must be to the left of a B
10:47 - so we can return left similarly if the
10:50 - cross product is less than zero then P
10:53 - must be to the right of a B so we return
10:55 - right and if the cross product is
10:57 - neither greater than zero nor less than
10:59 - zero of course this means that the cross
11:01 - product must be exactly zero and in this
11:03 - case P must be lying on
11:05 - the line containing the line segment a-b
11:07 - so we will return the constant on the
11:09 - line the functions subtract and get
11:11 - cross product are quite simple to write
11:13 - so we can take a quick look at them so
11:16 - I'll just erase this and we can see
11:18 - these functions so the get cross product
11:21 - function takes two points p1 and p2 and
11:23 - simply calculates the cross product
11:25 - using the formula that we saw previously
11:28 - similarly the subtract function takes
11:31 - two points p1 and p2 creates a new point
11:34 - called result which contains the value
11:37 - of p2 subtracted from p1 for both the x
11:40 - and y-coordinates so in this video we
11:44 - found out how to solve a very
11:45 - fundamental geometric problem using a
11:47 - program which is finding the direction
11:49 - of a point from a line segment and this
11:51 - has many important uses such as telling
11:54 - the user in an online map that he needs
11:55 - to take a particular kind of turn like a
11:57 - right or left turn that's it for this
12:00 - video I hope you enjoyed it thanks for

Cleaned transcript:

hi there and welcome to another geometry video in the series maths for programmers previously in this series we saw how to calculate the area of a polygon using the concept of vector cross product in this video will once again use the concept of vector cross product to solve another fundamental problem in geometry how to find the direction of a point from a line segment so let's say I have a line segment a B and a point P what we want to know is if we're traveling along the line segment from A to B so I'll draw an arrow in this direction to indicate the direction in which we are moving so if we're moving from A to B we want to know whether P is to our left which raised in this case or whether P is to our right the point P doesn't have to lie between a and B so here we have a point P which actually lies much behind the line segment AP however this point still counts as being to the right of the line segment a B similarly we could have another point P Prime that is located much after the line segment a B however this point is also considered to be on the right of the line segment a B what we are trying to say is that if we extend this line segment infinitely in both directions and we are still traveling in the general direction of line segment a B then any point in this half will be considered to be on the left of the line segment and any point in this bottom half would be considered to be on the right of the line segment a B this is a very fundamental problem and is commonly encountered for example when giving directions in an online map so let's say we have a user at Point a who actually wants to reach the point C now a good set of directions to give this user would be to ask him to first reach point B and then take a right turn in order to reach point C how do we know that the user has to take a right turn at B and not a left turn well this is because the Point C lies to the right of line segment a B knowing the direction of a point from a line segment also acts as the building to solve more complicated problems such as finding if two line segments intersect and also finding the convex hull of a set of points so we have with us two points a and B which together represent the line segment a B and we also have a Third Point P and we need to tell whether P is to the left of a B or to the right in order to do that we first need to fix a mathematical representation for the points a B and P so we will first use a coordinate system now the choice the coordinate system is very important and can make it difficult or easy depending on your choice to solve the problem for most twodimensional problems and this is a two dimensional problem choosing the Cartesian plane as the coordinate system is a natural choice and also a good choice so let's draw this diagram on an arbitrary Cartesian plane so in this plane we have two perpendicular axes x and y and we also have numbers marked along both axes to help us identify the coordinate value of point so in order to represent the point a we can simply use its x coordinate value which is say roughly minus 30 and its y coordinate value which is say roughly plus 10 so in this case we can say x is minus 30 comma 10 similarly the rough coordinate values for B would be say 29 comma minus 15 and P can be represented mathematically as the order 15 comma 28 as we said at the beginning of this video we want to use the concept of cross product from vector algebra to solve this problem and now that we have a mathematical representation of all the points we can proceed to use the cross product however cross product can only be applied to a pair of vectors at a time and here we have three points so what we can do is let's just ignore the point a for now now we're left with only two points B and P so let's take the cross product of B and P so B cross P mathematically is equal to the x coordinate of B into the y coordinate of P minus the y coordinate of B into the x coordinate of P now the cross product is an interesting property let's label the origin of the coordinate system the point where the X as well as the Y coordinates have a value of zero as o or the origin and now let's draw the angle B or P now the cross product is positive if and only if this angle is counterclockwise and conversely the cross product is negative if and only if this angle is clockwise we can quickly verify it for this given example here we can quite clearly see that the angle bo P is counterclockwise so we expect the cross product to be positive and if we calculate the value of the cross product it comes up to be 1037 which is indeed positive let's wipe that out and let's extend the line segment we'll be infinitely in both directions now we can make an interesting observation any point P that is in this upper half if we notice the angle this point makes with the line segment bo so if we take B or P for any point that is in this upper half the angle will be counterclockwise which means the value of the cross product is going to be positive similarly if we look at any point in this lower half the angle that this point makes so if you take bo P for a point that is in this lower half the angle will always be clockwise which means the expected value of the cross product will be negative now suppose that we had a line segment ap where a was at the origin of the coordinate system now we can just remove this o and replace it by a without making any difference anywhere and now let's say we're traveling in the direction of AP we can see quite clearly that the points P that have a positive cross product where B cross P is positive are exactly the same points that are to the left of a B and the points that have a negative cross product are nothing but those points which are to the right of a B so given a line segment a B and a point P if a happens to be at the origin of the corner system we can find out the direction of P very easily we can simply take the cross product B P and if it's positive that means P is to the left of a B and if it's negative that means P is to the right if we now go back to our original problem where we have a line segment a B where is not at the origin how can we go about solving this problem well a simple solution is to translate the coordinate system so that the origin lies exactly at a to do this we can subtract the coordinate values of a from all three points a B and P of course when we subtract a from itself we get zero which is why a becomes the origin and when we complete the translation we will have values for P as 45 comma 18 and the value for B as 59 comma minus 25 since a is now at the origin to decide whether P is to the left of the line segment a B or to the right we can simply compute the cross product B cross B and if it is positive we will know that B is to the left which it is in this case or if it is negative we know that B is to the right one interesting case that we haven't explored is what happens when the cross product is exactly zero in that case P is neither to the left nor to the right of line segment a P in fact if we were to extend line segment a B in both directions infinitely then P would be lying somewhere along this line now let's take a look at some C++ code that finds the direction of a point from a line segment the first thing we need to do is figure out how to represent a point in our program and since C++ is an objectoriented language a good decision is to use a struct or a class so we'll declare a struct called point that has two member variables x and y and these of course represent the x and y coordinates of the point itself notice that we use the double data type to store the x and y because the coordinates of a point can have any real number as it their value not necessarily just integers since we talked about left and right directions in the program a lot let's declare some constants so that we don't have to use strings everywhere so here we declare three integers as constants one to represent the left direction to represent the right direction and the third one for the case when the point is exactly on the line okay now we will declare a function called get direction which takes the three points a B and is P as input a and B of course represent the line segment a B and P is the point whose direction we want to know and this function will return an int and this integer would be one of these three constants left right around the line to mean that P is either to the left of a B or to the right of a B or exactly on the line containing the line segment a B since the point a may not necessarily lie on the origin the first thing we need to do is subtract the value of point a from point B and P as us now we don't know how to do subtraction but let's just assume that a function subtract exists which can solve our problem so in that case we can just do something like this we can say B is equal to subtract of B comma a we'll take this to mean that B is B minus a there should exist a function called subtract which given two points returns the second point subtracted from the first point similarly we can also say P is equal to subtract of P comma a so at this point in our program we now are in a situation where both B and P have been translated by the value of a and a is effectively now at the origin so now we need to calculate the cross product of B and P we need to calculate B cross B just like we assumed that there is a function called subtract we'll also assume that there is a function that can get us the cross product of B comma P so then we can write some code like this we can say cross product is equal to the value of B cross P and we'll assume that another function called get browse product exists which will compute P cross P for us the remaining part of the code is now quite simple if the cross product is greater than zero then we know that P must be to the left of a B so we can return left similarly if the cross product is less than zero then P must be to the right of a B so we return right and if the cross product is neither greater than zero nor less than zero of course this means that the cross product must be exactly zero and in this case P must be lying on the line containing the line segment ab so we will return the constant on the line the functions subtract and get cross product are quite simple to write so we can take a quick look at them so I'll just erase this and we can see these functions so the get cross product function takes two points p1 and p2 and simply calculates the cross product using the formula that we saw previously similarly the subtract function takes two points p1 and p2 creates a new point called result which contains the value of p2 subtracted from p1 for both the x and ycoordinates so in this video we found out how to solve a very fundamental geometric problem using a program which is finding the direction of a point from a line segment and this has many important uses such as telling the user in an online map that he needs to take a particular kind of turn like a right or left turn that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it thanks for
