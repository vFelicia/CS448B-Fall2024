00:00 - So far in our previous lessons we have
seen how to work with pointer variables.
00:05 - So we pretty much understand the basics,
in this lesson we will write some more
00:10 - code using pointers
00:11 - and we will look through some of these
concepts.
00:14 - In more detail using some examples, the
first thing that I want to point out is
00:19 - that pointer variables are strongly
typed.
00:22 - What it means is that you need a pointer
variable of a particular type
00:27 - to store the address of the
particular type of the variable.
00:30 - So int* or a pointer to integer will
be needed to store the address of an
00:35 - integer, character pointer will be
needed to store the address of a character
00:38 - and similarly if we have a user defined
structure
00:42 - or class then we need a pointer of that
particular
00:45 - type only but why do we need these strong
types.
00:48 - Isn't it that the pointer variables 
just store the address of the variable.
00:53 - So why couldn't we have just one type
00:55 - that will be some generic type to
store the address
00:58 - of all kind of variables and the answer is that
we do not use the pointer variables
01:04 - only to store memory addresses but
we also use them
01:07 - to dereference these addresses so that
we can
01:11 - access and modify the values in these
addresses.
01:15 - Now as you know datatypes have different
sizes
01:19 - like in a typical modern day compiler an
integer
01:22 - is stored in four bytes, a character
variable
01:26 - is stored in one byte, a float
01:30 - variable is stored in four bytes and these
variables differ not only
01:34 - in their sizes they also differ in how
we store
01:38 - information in whatever bytes are
available for these variables or data
01:42 - types.
01:43 - Let's say we have an integer A
01:46 - and its value is 1025 and this
01:49 - is how it is led out in the memory.Each
bracket here is one bite.
01:54 - Let's say this particular byte which
is the least significant byte
01:58 - is byte 0 and then we go on like byte
02:01 - one byte two and byte
02:05 - three.Now we also know that each byte in
the memory
02:08 - is addressable.Let's say the address of
byte zero
02:12 - is 200 now these four bytes need to be
contiguous.Let's say the address of
02:16 - byte 1 is 201 and then we go on
like 202
02:20 - and 203.When an
02:24 - integer is represented in the memory,
is stored in the memory the
02:27 - left most bit stores the
02:31 - information that whether this integer
is positive or negative so this is also
02:34 - called
02:35 - sign bit and
02:38 - rest 31 bits are used to store the value.
So if you see we have
02:43 - a one at right most bit with
02:46 - place value 2 to the power zero and
at this particular bit
02:50 - with place value 2 to the power 10.
02:54 - So the overall value that we have in
binary here
02:57 - is 1025 in decimal.Now
03:01 - what if I declare a pointer to integer
P
03:05 - and store the address of A in P by using
the ampersand operator.
03:09 - What will happen if I print the value of
P,
03:12 - the value of P or the address stored in P
will be
03:16 - 200 the address of byte 0.
So we are kind of saying that we have
03:21 - the address of an integer variable starting
at address 200.
03:25 - If we dereference this address and
try to print
03:28 - *P we want to know the value at
this particular address.
03:32 - Then the machine sees that ok P is a pointer
to
03:35 - integer so we need to look at four
bytes
03:39 - starting address 200 and then the
machine knows that
03:43 - how to extract the value of an
integer datatype. 
03:46 - So 
03:49 - it retrieves the value 1025 out of these
03:53 - four bytes.Now if P was a character
pointer
03:56 - then while dereferencing the machine
would have looked at only one byte
04:00 - because a character variable
04:01 - is only one byte.If P was
04:05 - a pointer to float then although float
is also stored in four bytes
04:09 - but the way information is written for
float in these
04:13 - four bytes is different from the way
information is written
04:16 - for an integer datatype.So the value printed
would have been something else.
04:20 - Let's go write some of this in a real
program and see what happens.
04:24 - In my C program I'll first
04:27 - declare an integer 'a' equal to 1025
04:32 - and now i will declare a pointer to integer 'p'
04:35 - and then i will store the address of 'a' in 'p'
04:39 - by using the ampersand operator.Now I'll
write a print statement
04:42 - like this size of integer
04:45 - is and we have a function sizeof in C
04:49 - which gives us the size of a particular
datatype in bytes
04:53 - and now i will write a print statement like
this, address is equal to
04:57 - 'p' and value is equal to
05:00 - '*p'.We dereference 'p' to print the
05:04 - value.Now let us see what is the
output of this program
05:07 - no points for guessing this is pretty
straight forward the size of integer
05:11 - is 4 bytes the address that we're showing
here is some address
05:15 - and the value is 1025.
05:18 - Ok now i will do some trick here I will declare a
character pointer let's say the name of
05:24 - the variable is 'p0'.
05:26 - Now I will try to put the same address
05:29 - as we have in 'p' into 'p0' by writing a
statement like this
05:34 - but this will give us a compilation error
because 'p0' is a pointer to
05:38 - character and 'p' is a pointer to integer.
05:40 - So what we will do here is typecast
05:44 - 'p' to character pointer
05:47 - and then assign the value and now I will write
two more print statements.
05:52 - First is "size of character is these many
bytes" and we use a method sizeof again
05:56 - and the second is the address is 'p0'
06:00 - and the value at address is '*p0'
so we dereference we try to 
06:04 - dereference 'p0' now
06:06 - and let us see what's the output now the
first line of output is size of integer
06:11 -  is 4 bytes
06:12 - address, because we are running the program
fresh
06:16 - this address will not be the previous
address, the address from the previous run.
06:19 - This will be a different address by
dereferencing the integer pointer 
06:23 - we're getting the value 1025.
06:25 - Now the next line of output is size
of character is one bytes
06:28 - address is 5373032 which is
the same address
06:32 - as we have in the second line but the
value this time
06:35 - is 1.Now why is this value 1,
06:40 - once again if we write 1025 in binary using
32 bits
06:44 - then this will be the representation when
we do this
06:48 - typecasting here trying to store the
address of 'p'
06:51 - in 'p0' then the address of this
particular byte
06:55 - the rightmost byte is stored in 'p0'.
06:58 - But when we dereference 'p0' because 'p0'
is a pointer to character the machines
07:02 - say that hey this is a pointer to a character
07:05 - and character is only one byte so I will
look at only one byte to see the value
07:10 - and if you see this particular byte in 
binary
07:14 - is 1 and that's why this
07:17 - output here is one. Ok, I'll write two more
print statements now
07:21 - one to print the address p plus one and
the value at address P plus one.
07:27 - Now as we know we can add or subtract
07:30 - an integer constant from a pointer 
variable.
07:34 - This is allowed in fact the only pointer
arithmetic that is allowed is adding or
07:38 - subtracting some constant integer
value to
07:41 - the pointer. p+1 will take us to the
address of the next integer,
07:46 - so it will skip four bytes and take us
four bytes ahead.
07:50 - Let's say we also want to print p0
plus one and the value at p0 plus 
07:53 - one.
07:55 - Okay now let's see the output of this
particular program
07:58 - the address of 'a' this time is 4456036
08:01 - that's what is allocated for 'a' in
this particular run.
08:06 - The value is 1025 p plus one is 445
6040, if you see this is 4 bytes more
08:12 - than
08:13 - the address of 'a' because size of integer is
4 bytes and 'p' is a pointer to integer.
08:18 - So incrementing 'p' takes us
08:22 - four bytes forward and this value is some
garbage value because we have not filled
08:26 - anything in this particular address so
there is some garbage in the memory
08:29 - which
08:30 - we are picking up.Now address in 'p0' is
also 4456036 which is the address
08:36 - of the first byte the least significant
byte of
08:40 - 'a' the value is 1.
08:43 - Now p0 plus one is 4456037 here we
have
08:47 - a value which is one byte more and this
is because character
08:51 - is stored in one bytes.Now the value
here is four,
08:54 - if you see p0 plus one will
take us to this particular byte
08:57 - the address of this particular byte and this
particular byte in binary
09:02 - is 4.
09:04 - This was to show you how things happen in
memory when we
09:07 - dereference a pointer variable by
using the Astrick operator
09:11 - and also what happens when we perform
pointer
09:14 - arithmetic with a particular pointer type.
09:17 - This typecasting of pointer variable
from one to another
09:20 - also has some use cases.We will discuss
them later.
09:24 - Now we will discuss one pointer type
which is generic pointer type.
09:29 - It does not correspond to a particular
datatype and this pointer type is called void
09:33 - pointer
09:34 - and we declare this particular pointer type
09:37 - by using the keyword void and using an
astrick sign in front of
09:41 - the variable name.Again now we can write
09:45 - something like 'p0' is equal to 'p' we do
not need an explicit
09:51 - typecasting here like this.The statement
'p0' is equal to 'p'
09:55 - is valid and this will not give you
compilation error and because this
09:59 - particular
10:00 - pointer type is not mapped to a
particular datatype
10:03 - we cannot dereference this particular
pointer variable.So if you try to print
10:08 - star
10:08 - 'p0' or astrick 'p0' this will give you
10:11 - an error.We're getting a compilation error.
10:16 - we can only print the address and as
we can see here the address is same as
10:21 - the address of
10:22 - 'a' and if we perform arithmetic if we
try to
10:26 - do something like p0 plus one access
something like p0 plus one
10:30 - this is also not possible this will also
give you compilation error.
10:33 - We will come back to the use cases of 
void pointers
10:37 - in forthcoming lessons.Lets for now
know that there is something
10:42 - called void pointers.So this was diving
deep into
10:46 - pointer types, typecasting and
10:49 - pointer arithmetic.We will have a lot
of fun with pointers in the coming
10:53 - lessons.
10:54 - So thanks for watching.

Cleaned transcript:

So far in our previous lessons we have seen how to work with pointer variables. So we pretty much understand the basics, in this lesson we will write some more code using pointers and we will look through some of these concepts. In more detail using some examples, the first thing that I want to point out is that pointer variables are strongly typed. What it means is that you need a pointer variable of a particular type to store the address of the particular type of the variable. So int* or a pointer to integer will be needed to store the address of an integer, character pointer will be needed to store the address of a character and similarly if we have a user defined structure or class then we need a pointer of that particular type only but why do we need these strong types. Isn't it that the pointer variables just store the address of the variable. So why couldn't we have just one type that will be some generic type to store the address of all kind of variables and the answer is that we do not use the pointer variables only to store memory addresses but we also use them to dereference these addresses so that we can access and modify the values in these addresses. Now as you know datatypes have different sizes like in a typical modern day compiler an integer is stored in four bytes, a character variable is stored in one byte, a float variable is stored in four bytes and these variables differ not only in their sizes they also differ in how we store information in whatever bytes are available for these variables or data types. Let's say we have an integer A and its value is 1025 and this is how it is led out in the memory.Each bracket here is one bite. Let's say this particular byte which is the least significant byte is byte 0 and then we go on like byte one byte two and byte three.Now we also know that each byte in the memory is addressable.Let's say the address of byte zero is 200 now these four bytes need to be contiguous.Let's say the address of byte 1 is 201 and then we go on like 202 and 203.When an integer is represented in the memory, is stored in the memory the left most bit stores the information that whether this integer is positive or negative so this is also called sign bit and rest 31 bits are used to store the value. So if you see we have a one at right most bit with place value 2 to the power zero and at this particular bit with place value 2 to the power 10. So the overall value that we have in binary here is 1025 in decimal.Now what if I declare a pointer to integer P and store the address of A in P by using the ampersand operator. What will happen if I print the value of P, the value of P or the address stored in P will be 200 the address of byte 0. So we are kind of saying that we have the address of an integer variable starting at address 200. If we dereference this address and try to print *P we want to know the value at this particular address. Then the machine sees that ok P is a pointer to integer so we need to look at four bytes starting address 200 and then the machine knows that how to extract the value of an integer datatype. So it retrieves the value 1025 out of these four bytes.Now if P was a character pointer then while dereferencing the machine would have looked at only one byte because a character variable is only one byte.If P was a pointer to float then although float is also stored in four bytes but the way information is written for float in these four bytes is different from the way information is written for an integer datatype.So the value printed would have been something else. Let's go write some of this in a real program and see what happens. In my C program I'll first declare an integer 'a' equal to 1025 and now i will declare a pointer to integer 'p' and then i will store the address of 'a' in 'p' by using the ampersand operator.Now I'll write a print statement like this size of integer is and we have a function sizeof in C which gives us the size of a particular datatype in bytes and now i will write a print statement like this, address is equal to 'p' and value is equal to '*p'.We dereference 'p' to print the value.Now let us see what is the output of this program no points for guessing this is pretty straight forward the size of integer is 4 bytes the address that we're showing here is some address and the value is 1025. Ok now i will do some trick here I will declare a character pointer let's say the name of the variable is 'p0'. Now I will try to put the same address as we have in 'p' into 'p0' by writing a statement like this but this will give us a compilation error because 'p0' is a pointer to character and 'p' is a pointer to integer. So what we will do here is typecast 'p' to character pointer and then assign the value and now I will write two more print statements. First is "size of character is these many bytes" and we use a method sizeof again and the second is the address is 'p0' and the value at address is '*p0' so we dereference we try to dereference 'p0' now and let us see what's the output now the first line of output is size of integer is 4 bytes address, because we are running the program fresh this address will not be the previous address, the address from the previous run. This will be a different address by dereferencing the integer pointer we're getting the value 1025. Now the next line of output is size of character is one bytes address is 5373032 which is the same address as we have in the second line but the value this time is 1.Now why is this value 1, once again if we write 1025 in binary using 32 bits then this will be the representation when we do this typecasting here trying to store the address of 'p' in 'p0' then the address of this particular byte the rightmost byte is stored in 'p0'. But when we dereference 'p0' because 'p0' is a pointer to character the machines say that hey this is a pointer to a character and character is only one byte so I will look at only one byte to see the value and if you see this particular byte in binary is 1 and that's why this output here is one. Ok, I'll write two more print statements now one to print the address p plus one and the value at address P plus one. Now as we know we can add or subtract an integer constant from a pointer variable. This is allowed in fact the only pointer arithmetic that is allowed is adding or subtracting some constant integer value to the pointer. p+1 will take us to the address of the next integer, so it will skip four bytes and take us four bytes ahead. Let's say we also want to print p0 plus one and the value at p0 plus one. Okay now let's see the output of this particular program the address of 'a' this time is 4456036 that's what is allocated for 'a' in this particular run. The value is 1025 p plus one is 445 6040, if you see this is 4 bytes more than the address of 'a' because size of integer is 4 bytes and 'p' is a pointer to integer. So incrementing 'p' takes us four bytes forward and this value is some garbage value because we have not filled anything in this particular address so there is some garbage in the memory which we are picking up.Now address in 'p0' is also 4456036 which is the address of the first byte the least significant byte of 'a' the value is 1. Now p0 plus one is 4456037 here we have a value which is one byte more and this is because character is stored in one bytes.Now the value here is four, if you see p0 plus one will take us to this particular byte the address of this particular byte and this particular byte in binary is 4. This was to show you how things happen in memory when we dereference a pointer variable by using the Astrick operator and also what happens when we perform pointer arithmetic with a particular pointer type. This typecasting of pointer variable from one to another also has some use cases.We will discuss them later. Now we will discuss one pointer type which is generic pointer type.

We will come back to the use cases of void pointers in forthcoming lessons.Lets for now know that there is something called void pointers.So this was diving deep into pointer types, typecasting and pointer arithmetic.We will have a lot of fun with pointers in the coming lessons. So thanks for watching.
