00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's a really interesting article
00:03 - titled sustainable living as an indie
00:06 - bottom feeder so basically can you make
00:07 - a living whilst not being a famous Indie
00:09 - Dev this was written all the way back in
00:11 - 2017 and look at that look at the author
00:13 - Yep this was written exactly by me six
00:16 - years ago and this is telling my story
00:17 - so let's read through it and see if
00:19 - everything that I've said back then
00:20 - still makes sense still is applicable
00:21 - nowadays so howdy my name is cardos I'm
00:25 - the developer behind the one man in the
00:26 - studio and on slope Studios and you've
00:28 - probably never heard of me my story
00:29 - isn't sexy I didn't quit my job and work
00:32 - on a masterpiece for five years while
00:33 - living on Ramen I'm not an autor making
00:35 - a game that won't change the world and
00:37 - make people tattoo the name on their
00:38 - forehead my car is 12 years old my phone
00:40 - is 4 years old my apartment is boringly
00:43 - normal on a second world country my
00:45 - games Don't Get Hype previews on kataku
00:47 - or polygon they don't have a
00:48 - metacritosaur they don't get reviewed on
00:50 - IGN or rock paper Shopkin they don't get
00:52 - covered by Turtle biscuit or Giant Bomb
00:54 - but despite all that I've been running a
00:56 - sustainable business since 2013. so yeah
00:58 - right away all of this is still
00:59 - applicable to my myself nowadays I have
01:01 - made over eight games on Steam those
01:04 - games have sold hundreds of thousands of
01:05 - copies they've made over one million
01:07 - dollars in Gross and yet like it says
01:08 - here you've probably never heard of me
01:10 - so most people do not know the name
01:11 - endless loop Studios I am definitely not
01:13 - a famous Dev but I have been doing this
01:15 - as a sustainable business since 2013.
01:18 - and yeah it's funny to read this six
01:20 - years afterwards since then I have
01:21 - upgraded my car I used to have a Hyundai
01:24 - Getz now I've got a nucleo the car is
01:26 - from 2017 so I guess I've got a 60 year
01:28 - old car now my phone I've also upgraded
01:30 - but it's also about four years old now
01:32 - still live in the same apartment still
01:34 - in the same country and if my games
01:36 - still don't get high previews I'm
01:37 - currently working on my next team game
01:39 - dinky Guardians and for that game I
01:41 - highly doubt that it's going to be
01:42 - covered on Kotaku or polygon but I'm
01:44 - still quite confident that it won't be
01:45 - financially viable same so far all this
01:47 - yep still applicable nowadays so let's
01:49 - continue reading here's a nice
01:50 - screenshot from one of my first games
01:52 - gamecorp DX that is one of my most
01:54 - successful games it was made pretty
01:56 - quickly it's a relatively short game but
01:58 - the response was awesome the game is
01:59 - pretty cheap and everybody who buys it
02:01 - the reviews are still insanely positive
02:03 - nowadays so that was a great game so
02:05 - continuing my role models are more than
02:07 - likes of clay fairies from positive
02:08 - games and Jeff vogels spider web
02:10 - software rather than Eric Brown from
02:12 - stardew Valley or Toby Fox from
02:14 - undertale if you're looking to be in
02:15 - developer long term I fully believe the
02:17 - trick is quantity of sufficient quality
02:19 - so you have this ice don't very much
02:20 - agree with the sentiment obviously
02:22 - stardew Valley and undertale and those
02:24 - two are absolute masterpieces but they
02:26 - were also extremely risky gambons both
02:28 - these I think to more than five years
02:30 - each of them to the phone that is really
02:32 - risky spending five years working on
02:33 - just one game of course when it does go
02:36 - well then you get massively rewarded so
02:38 - both these developers they are insanely
02:40 - successful they can do whatever they
02:41 - want basically with one game they
02:42 - essentially won the lottery but
02:44 - personally I do not like to gamble my
02:46 - livelihood on the lottery I prefer more
02:48 - stable things so that is why Cliff
02:50 - Harris he is developer behind democracy
02:51 - so that was a huge hit also made
02:53 - production line also really great he got
02:55 - into publishing and started publishing
02:56 - some games made big Pharma also
02:58 - published created the Space Battles that
03:00 - was another big hit a long time ago
03:01 - we're doing the sync battles that was
03:03 - also interesting and for Jeff Hogan with
03:04 - spider web software there's all kinds of
03:07 - very strange very Niche old-school RPGs
03:09 - he has made a ton of them and over the
03:12 - years has developed a very dedicated
03:13 - audience that buys pretty much any game
03:15 - as long as it fits that Niche there is
03:17 - an excellent GDC tone that I highly
03:19 - recommend you go and look at so like I
03:20 - said here I've only believe the trick is
03:22 - primarily quantity of sufficient quality
03:24 - rather than risking your whole life on
03:26 - pushing the quality as much as possible
03:27 - I'm a big fan of trying to lower the
03:29 - rest so you can actually keep doing this
03:30 - for the long term so as with any
03:32 - business there won't be ups and downs I
03:34 - expected my second game to do as well as
03:36 - the first and as a result I invested way
03:38 - too much time and money and when sales
03:39 - were way below the first one I panicked
03:41 - quite a bit and I became concerned about
03:43 - the viability of indie game development
03:45 - as a sustainable long-term career so
03:46 - yeah this definitely happened to me my
03:48 - first game Survivor Squad was
03:49 - surprisingly successful back then green
03:52 - light had just started so steam wasn't
03:53 - yet as much saturated as it is right now
03:55 - and that game that game idea that
03:57 - concept for some reason that really
03:58 - resonated with people so that game
04:00 - definitely sound a lot more than I
04:01 - expected but the second game server
04:03 - scored gun toys which was a direct
04:05 - sequel that one suddenly did not do as
04:07 - well I worked on that game a lot more I
04:09 - believe it is a better game in literally
04:10 - every single way but for some reason the
04:13 - market didn't like it steam didn't
04:14 - really care for it so that game I think
04:16 - it's only literally one tenth despite
04:18 - taking longer to make and despite
04:19 - investing a lot more time on buying art
04:21 - and all kinds of things so yeah when
04:23 - that second game flew up that really
04:24 - scared me quite a bit and like I said
04:26 - here as a result I did the best safest
04:28 - thing that I could do I spent three
04:30 - months remaking my most successful Flash
04:31 - game and made a tiny cheap highly
04:33 - focused highly polished game which found
04:35 - quite a bit of success which then helped
04:37 - me develop my fourth game and so on that
04:39 - game that I'm talking about that was
04:40 - gamecorp DX which yep the original game
04:43 - the original Flash game was called
04:44 - gamecorp it came out before I started
04:46 - getting into unity and making Steam
04:48 - games so I guess came out in I don't
04:49 - know 2011 maybe 2012 and that game was
04:51 - highly successful in the flash game or
04:53 - rather I should say highly successful in
04:55 - terms of players and gameplays
04:57 - definitely not highly successful in
04:58 - terms of monetary Revenue flash is
05:00 - really difficult The Flash version of
05:02 - the game was actually played six million
05:04 - times that is an insane amount I can't
05:06 - even imagine six million people playing
05:07 - my game but has resulted in financial
05:09 - terms that game only made about a
05:11 - thousand dollars whereas a remake that I
05:13 - made on scene that I sold for three
05:14 - bucks that one made something like a
05:16 - hundred thousand
05:18 - foreign
05:20 - flash was definitely an interesting
05:23 - thing I definitely learned a lot from it
05:24 - but in financial terms it was incredibly
05:26 - difficult okay so here are some tips
05:28 - that have helped me along the way tip
05:30 - number one keep your burn rate as low as
05:31 - possible absolutely great tip I
05:33 - definitely still believe in this
05:34 - nowadays I'll start with the most
05:36 - obvious one although also the most
05:37 - difficult one to use since it is very
05:39 - much based on where you live if I was
05:40 - living in San Francisco spending 4K a
05:42 - month just to stay afloat then I
05:44 - wouldn't be able to do this you can make
05:45 - a decent tight small polish game in six
05:47 - months and if your burn rate is 4K then
05:50 - that one cost you 24K whereas if the
05:52 - burn rate is just a thousand then it
05:53 - will only cost you six thousand so yeah
05:55 - difference between 24K and 6K that is
05:57 - difference between requiring something
05:58 - like 500 sales to make a living versus
06:01 - requiring something like five thousand
06:03 - if you can live on a thousand dollars a
06:04 - month you can make a really tight polish
06:06 - two-hour game for six thousand dollars
06:07 - and assuming the game is of sufficient
06:09 - quality that is an achievable amount to
06:11 - sell say at this one I really do believe
06:12 - this is one of the let's say secrets
06:15 - that have allowed me to become an indie
06:16 - Dev the fact that I live in a relatively
06:18 - low-cost living and personally I don't
06:20 - really spend money on anything I don't
06:22 - really care about buying fancy clothes
06:24 - fancy watches fancy cars whatever I
06:26 - don't really care much for them except
06:27 - when I first moved out of my parents
06:29 - house and I started Living by myself I
06:30 - was living as cheaply as possible and I
06:32 - was living around 750 bucks a month so
06:34 - that is why I managed to essentially
06:36 - become a sustainable in developer If
06:38 - instead I was burning through four
06:39 - thousand dollars a month if I was doing
06:41 - that then it would be much more
06:42 - difficult to just basically stay afloat
06:44 - so here continuing Survivor Squad took
06:46 - 10 months to make I was living with my
06:47 - parents and I didn't really go out much
06:49 - or do anything so my Burden rate was
06:50 - essentially zero dollars yep that's
06:52 - correct I did the programming Art and
06:54 - Design myself I spent 350 bucks on
06:56 - hosting royalty free sound effects and
06:58 - the green light fee so do you think that
07:00 - game was profitable the answer is yes of
07:02 - course of course it was I don't know the
07:03 - number off the top of my head but I'm
07:04 - sure that game made over 50k so again
07:07 - spending 350 bucks and 10 months of my
07:09 - life for 50k that is definitely very
07:11 - easily to make profitable which again
07:13 - would be very different if I had spent
07:15 - 4K a month that would be very different
07:17 - math all of a sudden that would not
07:18 - become profitable so here don't demo
07:21 - your life on the expectation that your
07:22 - game won't sell a hundred thousand
07:23 - copies you might think well Sim has 140
07:26 - million users how hard can it be to sell
07:27 - to just point one percent of that and
07:29 - the answer is that it's extremely hard
07:31 - very very hard always be hyper aware of
07:33 - survivorship bias everyone knows tardy
07:35 - Valley's own millions of copies but
07:37 - nobody knows the 200 other games that
07:38 - were released that month and made either
07:40 - nothing or a very small reasonable
07:42 - amount you can look it seem spy and look
07:43 - at the games in a similar genre and
07:45 - price Point's yours so could you survive
07:47 - to make another game if you sold just 5
07:48 - 000 copies what about 3 000 with the
07:51 - trick only of three companies a day
07:52 - combined with your savings be enough to
07:54 - help you make another game yep these are
07:55 - all still very valid questions nowadays
07:57 - the only difference is that nowadays
07:59 - things are even more difficult so
08:00 - nowadays I'm pretty sure there's a lot
08:02 - more than just 200 games released per
08:04 - month I think unless I checked I think
08:06 - last year there were some like 15 000
08:08 - games so that actually means around a
08:10 - thousand games per month now of course
08:12 - some of those are Chevron wear but a lot
08:13 - of those are actually very high quality
08:15 - games and seem now has a lot more
08:17 - millions of users I don't know what is
08:18 - the total but just recently I think they
08:20 - hit 30 million concurrent active users
08:22 - so the total number of users that is an
08:24 - insane amount but at the same time most
08:26 - of those will only see the top games so
08:28 - most of the 1000 games that come out
08:30 - every single month most people will
08:31 - never see any of those same point of
08:33 - this that I wrote back in 2017 this is
08:35 - definitely still accurate nowadays if
08:36 - anything nowadays it is even more
08:38 - difficult start as small as you can
08:39 - focus on a tiny scope and make a tiny
08:42 - product of good quality players much
08:43 - prefer to have a small 2 hour
08:45 - interesting quality experience rather
08:46 - than a 40 hour messy game with many bugs
08:48 - no polish and a dozen meaningless
08:50 - Channel features your goal should be to
08:51 - design a game that when a player
08:53 - finishes they want more rather than
08:54 - something huge that no one will play
08:56 - because they won't get bored and
08:57 - frustrated within the first hour yep
08:59 - that is some generally very good advice
09:00 - making something small tight and
09:02 - Polished that is going to be much better
09:04 - rather than something that technically
09:06 - has hundreds of hours of gameplay but
09:08 - those are all very low quality however
09:10 - at the same time don't push this to the
09:11 - absolute extreme if you make a game that
09:13 - just has one hour of gameplay even if
09:15 - that gameplay is really excellent that
09:17 - might be not enough to justify whatever
09:19 - cost is for the game there are always
09:21 - going to be some people who play games
09:23 - sub two hours and just refund them but
09:25 - those are usually up wires if your game
09:27 - has at least two hours of content and if
09:29 - those two hours are excellent then those
09:31 - people will probably be very happy and
09:32 - the game can be quite successful and
09:34 - here use Early Access for feedback not
09:36 - for funding Early Access is awesome I've
09:38 - used it for all except my first game
09:40 - getting people to play your game ahead
09:42 - of an official launch is extremely
09:43 - important especially if you're keeping
09:44 - your costs as low as possible and don't
09:46 - want to hire professional testers unless
09:48 - you already have a built-in audience or
09:50 - press valve contacts Early Access is not
09:52 - for funding you will likely not be
09:54 - featured on the popular new release list
09:56 - and will likely only sell a few hundred
09:58 - or maybe 1 000 copies depending on the
10:00 - price however make sure your early asset
10:02 - release is in a decent State as an
10:03 - unknown in developer the simmer V score
10:05 - is the most important thing that will
10:07 - help you selling copies and you must
10:08 - defend their own costs if you're only
10:10 - using internally access with many nasty
10:11 - bugs under the guise of it's just an
10:13 - alpha it says over right on the same
10:14 - page you only get negative reviews and
10:16 - even if you fix those issues within 24
10:18 - hours those reviews will still stay
10:19 - there and keep your score down forever
10:21 - as for feedback be very active in
10:23 - responding to comments and put out
10:24 - updates consistently yep all of this
10:26 - still excellent advice nowadays Early
10:28 - Access is definitely for feedback
10:29 - definitely not for funding if you're
10:31 - going into Early Access with the hopes
10:33 - of getting the funding to actually
10:34 - finish your game that is a terrible plan
10:36 - that will not work nowadays Early Access
10:38 - is even more difficult people are even
10:40 - more demanding so back then back in 2017
10:42 - if you put our game on Early Access
10:43 - people would kind of accept a few bugs
10:46 - here and there and a lack of content
10:47 - whereas nowadays they do not nowadays if
10:49 - you put out something on Early Access it
10:51 - better be extremely well polished so
10:52 - nowadays it does not need to be in a
10:54 - decent state it needs to be in an
10:55 - excellent state with quite a lot of
10:57 - content already and yet like I said back
10:59 - then steam review score is the most
11:00 - important thing and yep that is
11:01 - absolutely true that is still very much
11:03 - correct nowadays if you come out of the
11:04 - gate with only access with a subparent
11:06 - release and if the reviews come out
11:08 - negative coming back from that is
11:09 - essentially impossible and like I said
11:11 - here you won't get negative reviews and
11:13 - even if you fix those issues within 24
11:15 - hours the reviews will likely stay there
11:17 - and keep your score down forever there's
11:18 - certainly something that I know very
11:20 - very well there was one of my games
11:22 - where I actually forgot to add a folder
11:25 - on the Mac build like on the game I
11:26 - forgot to test does the founder exist it
11:28 - just assumed that the founder existed
11:30 - and on the build that I uploaded the
11:31 - same I forgot to add that folder so
11:33 - essentially on Mac the game was homily
11:34 - broken now as soon as the game came out
11:36 - I saw our view right away that said the
11:38 - game was broken on Mac it does not work
11:40 - right away I looked into the logs I saw
11:42 - that was a problem very easy fix so I
11:44 - fixed it super quickly literally within
11:46 - less than one hour of release I fixed
11:48 - that I did respond to that review and I
11:49 - said okay this has been fixed but the
11:51 - person who wrote that review they never
11:53 - bothered to update it so one tiny tiny
11:55 - issue that was fixed within 30 minutes
11:57 - of release even though I did fix it the
11:59 - review is still there it still drags
12:01 - down the score nowadays so reviews are
12:03 - extremely important and going into Early
12:05 - Access does not give you a reason to not
12:07 - worry too much people in Early Access
12:09 - expect the same level of Polish as a
12:11 - final game so absolutely do not use
12:13 - Early Access for funding and absolutely
12:14 - do not go with the mindset of it just
12:16 - announced it says on the same page
12:18 - people do not care if it is their only
12:19 - access people only expect a very well
12:21 - very polished very robust game with tons
12:24 - of content valid in long tail Yep this
12:26 - is extremely important since I look at
12:28 - my business as a long-term Venture I've
12:30 - only been long tail tremendously even my
12:32 - first game Survivor Squad which has a
12:33 - mixed review score still sells a handful
12:35 - of copies every month certainly not
12:37 - enough to live on but it does add up
12:38 - what that really means is that as long
12:40 - as I keep my burn rate low I don't need
12:42 - a game to break even super quickly as
12:44 - long as my costs were low enough that
12:45 - break even is achievable it's only a
12:47 - matter of time Yep this is absolutely
12:49 - true I mean nowadays it has been over 10
12:52 - years since I watched my first team game
12:53 - and it still sounds copies now obviously
12:56 - it doesn't sound too much nowadays the
12:57 - long tail that definitely does go down
12:59 - over time but still nowadays it still
13:01 - probably sells I don't know maybe a
13:03 - hundred bucks a month maybe something
13:04 - like that maybe 50 bucks so either way
13:06 - that game that I made over 10 years ago
13:08 - that one still pays for some groceries
13:10 - nowadays and of course that's only just
13:12 - one game so put all the games together
13:13 - and the long tail can be quite good even
13:15 - though nowadays my last scene game came
13:18 - out all the way back in 2019 so that was
13:19 - quite time ago so my steam Revenue has
13:22 - definitely dropped off quite
13:23 - significantly since all of those years
13:25 - ago but still it is still more than zero
13:27 - so all those games that I made all those
13:28 - years ago they still work nowadays and
13:30 - like I said if my burn rate is low which
13:32 - nowadays it still is it's a bit higher
13:34 - than it was all the way back then but
13:35 - it's not that much higher so the small
13:37 - amount that I still get paid from seam
13:39 - that still helps me cover quite a lot of
13:41 - costs for my daily life take it easy on
13:43 - discounts they are useful tool to find
13:45 - new players at different price points
13:46 - but don't go overboard and bundling your
13:48 - game for one dollar within three months
13:50 - of release just make a quick Buck stay
13:51 - strong and keep your eye on the long
13:53 - term Yep this is another thing as soon
13:55 - as you launch a game you won't get tons
13:56 - and tons of messages and emails from all
13:59 - kinds of obscure bundle sites they won't
14:01 - promise to you bundle your game and
14:02 - sometimes of copies but each of those
14:04 - copies you are only going to get
14:05 - literally something like 10 cents out of
14:07 - each of them and as soon as you bundle
14:09 - the game once some people look at that
14:10 - and they basically assume okay so this
14:12 - is the value that the game is worth
14:13 - nowadays the better strategy is really
14:15 - just discount your game nice and slowly
14:16 - over time once again goes back to what I
14:19 - was talking about the burner it if your
14:21 - burn rate is low and you're okay with
14:22 - spending a bit more time to actually
14:24 - break even if you're okay with that if
14:25 - that is sustainable to you then you can
14:27 - afford to essentially discount much
14:28 - slower so just discount 25 for the first
14:31 - six months then maybe just fifty percent
14:33 - on the second year and maybe on the
14:35 - third year or fourth year maybe you can
14:36 - go all the way down to 75 if you do that
14:38 - it won't take a bit longer to get the
14:40 - revenue but again if you can afford a
14:42 - burn rate over a long time in the end
14:44 - that won't be a better strategy always
14:46 - keep learning and growing yep right away
14:48 - obviously I agree with this I mean
14:49 - nowadays I have the channel and part of
14:51 - the reason why I created this channel
14:52 - was because I really wanted to keep
14:54 - learning things keep doing all kinds of
14:56 - things and I wanted sort of an excuse to
14:58 - force myself to do that so this channel
15:00 - making tutorials covering all kinds of
15:01 - unity and Game Dev content that is
15:03 - pretty much Mike's use to keep learning
15:05 - keep doing things I just think to myself
15:07 - I would like to teach this sort of thing
15:09 - make this sort of mechanic in a tutorial
15:10 - and if I want to teach it in a tutorial
15:12 - I need to know it myself very well so
15:14 - yep I'm definitely still very much a
15:15 - Believer on always keep learning and
15:17 - growing then the game development scene
15:18 - moves at a very fast pace it's seems
15:20 - that the game changes every six months
15:22 - so you have to adapt are you making a
15:23 - platformer with nice art it was easier
15:25 - to send out five years ago making a
15:27 - zombie crafting Survival game easier
15:29 - three years ago a king of the hill game
15:31 - easier one year ago yeah there are
15:33 - definitely some fads that come and go
15:34 - and some genres become way too
15:37 - oversaturated like for example making a
15:39 - platform with nice art nowadays in order
15:41 - to stand out you need to have something
15:42 - on the level of something like cuphead
15:44 - so it has to be that special to really
15:45 - stand out Platformers are a dime a dozen
15:48 - there are millions of them zombie
15:49 - crafting Survival game that one is
15:51 - actually not necessarily A Century I
15:53 - mean there are tons and tons of them but
15:54 - people can't seem to get enough of them
15:56 - so that's a genre that is also very
15:57 - saturated but can still work and King of
16:00 - the Hill game honestly nowadays I don't
16:02 - even know exactly what this refers to
16:03 - was there a big amount of King of the
16:05 - Hill games back in 2017 honestly I don't
16:07 - remember but yeah I guess uh fads come
16:10 - and go game genres appear and disappear
16:11 - nowadays the big one is vampire survival
16:13 - likes there's already a ton of them but
16:15 - there are still some that you find
16:16 - success you should stay up to date with
16:18 - the business side of things but also
16:19 - your own skill are you growing as a
16:21 - programmer artist designer are you
16:23 - becoming faster at producing good
16:24 - content in your engine of choice do you
16:26 - have reusable code so your next game
16:28 - will be up and running faster than
16:29 - before do you have some extra Sprites
16:31 - laying around that could be used to very
16:33 - quickly prototype an interesting idea
16:34 - remember time is money yep look at that
16:36 - so all the way back in 17 I was already
16:38 - talking about the benefits of reasonable
16:40 - code even though this in 2017 this would
16:42 - have been probably before I read code
16:45 - complaint so probably before my skills
16:47 - regarding clean code really massively
16:49 - improved so it's kind of funny that
16:50 - before then I was already seeing the
16:51 - value of it and he has some extra
16:52 - Sprites laying around yep that can
16:54 - definitely help back then I was in too
16:56 - used to using the unity assessor but
16:58 - nowadays there are tons of stuff on the
16:59 - accessor so even if you don't personally
17:01 - have some extra Sprites lying around you
17:03 - can definitely pick them up some things
17:04 - either on the Unis or on some sale or on
17:07 - a Humble Bundle getting assets has never
17:09 - been easier and cheaper so that is great
17:10 - next tip gather the following this is my
17:13 - biggest weakness since I'm not a very
17:14 - social person so I'll just write about
17:16 - the generally accepted device be active
17:18 - in all types of social media I ideally
17:20 - you should spend as much time marketing
17:22 - as you do actually developing so yep
17:23 - that is definitely very good advice and
17:25 - all this is still intrude to myself
17:26 - nowadays I am still not a very social
17:29 - person if you've been following this
17:30 - channel for quite some time you can see
17:32 - how it took me in literally years to be
17:34 - able to gain the confidence to turn the
17:35 - camera on and try out this type of video
17:37 - so as you can see I am actively learning
17:39 - my advice I am actively trying to learn
17:41 - and grow any of social media is still
17:42 - extremely important and since nowadays
17:45 - things are even more difficult than they
17:46 - were back in 2017 Yep this advice about
17:48 - spending as much time marketing as you
17:50 - do developing this is even more accurate
17:52 - now than ever nowadays if you just focus
17:54 - on developing your game nobody want to
17:56 - see it so you do need Marketing in order
17:57 - to actually find the people that won't
17:59 - play and like your game and for that
18:01 - here on YouTube you can do devlogs you
18:03 - can try to gather an audience by making
18:04 - tutorials like I've done although to be
18:06 - fair that does generate a more Game Dev
18:09 - audience rather than a game playing
18:10 - audience so that is not a very good
18:12 - strategy for finding game players but
18:13 - you can do General devlogs you can go
18:15 - the entertainment route kind of like
18:16 - Danny that is very successful and you
18:18 - can obviously experiment with all the
18:19 - the new social medias there have been
18:21 - lots of any devs recently that I found
18:23 - tons of success on Tick Tock so Tick
18:25 - Tock Instagram all kinds of short
18:26 - content nowadays that is really useful
18:28 - so in general keep in mind you should
18:30 - spend almost as much time marketing as
18:31 - you do developing one thing I've done is
18:33 - set up a Nissan letter sign up link in
18:34 - all my games and their websites through
18:36 - it I've gathered about 4 000 emails now
18:38 - that obviously doesn't mean that every
18:39 - time I announce the game I will suddenly
18:41 - sell that many companies but it does
18:42 - mean I'm not only starting from scratch
18:44 - in it that is really good advice
18:46 - nowadays I still have that mailing list
18:48 - so when I recently announced thinking
18:50 - Guardians I did send an email to
18:51 - devilist I can't remember how many
18:52 - people are on there but still it's more
18:54 - than zero so it does help and again
18:55 - focusing on the long term every game I
18:57 - release and every day goes by that list
18:59 - increases little by a little maybe one
19:01 - day I'll get to the point where eclipse
19:03 - is so that is Cliff Aries from pasta
19:04 - games and I'll be able to sell 9 000
19:06 - copies of a game before even hitting
19:08 - scene I think that was the game
19:09 - production line I think he made an alpha
19:11 - before going on to steam and that outfit
19:13 - was massively successful Sam if you do
19:15 - manage to gather a large following and
19:16 - large audience that enjoys your games if
19:18 - you gather that over many many years
19:19 - then things hopefully become easier and
19:21 - easier even if the market does become
19:23 - more and more centering when in doubt
19:25 - follow the TF2 Sniper as the wise man
19:27 - once said professionals have standards
19:29 - be polite be efficient have a plan to
19:31 - kill everyone you meet now we would
19:33 - advise replacing that last part with be
19:34 - prepared and have the plan to survive to
19:36 - fight another day if the worst possible
19:38 - scenario comes past but yeah whatever
19:40 - works for you yeah I would say this is
19:42 - definitely still a line that still
19:43 - resonates with me nowadays basically be
19:46 - professional if Game Dev is meant to be
19:48 - your career then take it as seriously as
19:49 - you take any job that you have an
19:51 - interest in make sure you have high
19:52 - standards with the things that you do
19:54 - and of course be polite there's no
19:55 - reason to respond negatively to anyone
19:57 - even negative reviews although that is
19:59 - quite difficult be efficient so in
20:01 - Practical terms this is why I talk so
20:03 - much about writing good clean code that
20:04 - is one of the best ways to get
20:06 - efficiency in game development and be
20:08 - prepared to have a plan to survive to
20:09 - fight another day that is why I never
20:11 - recommend you just quit your day job and
20:13 - try to bet it all on your very first
20:15 - game you should hopefully be honestate
20:17 - that if you do try to make a game and
20:18 - you're trying to make it successful song
20:20 - you should definitely not be in a
20:21 - position where if that game fails
20:23 - suddenly you go homeless and go hungry
20:24 - so that goes back to reducing your burn
20:26 - rate in order to reduce your risk in
20:27 - order to be able to do this for the long
20:29 - term as you gain experience and
20:30 - hopefully find more and more success in
20:32 - the game development is a very tough or
20:34 - crown business but I believe if you face
20:36 - reality instead of burying your head in
20:37 - the sand and focus on taking calculated
20:39 - risks you can't find success just don't
20:41 - define success as selling 100K units yep
20:43 - once again the same thing that I was
20:44 - saying make sure you lower your risk
20:46 - make sure you don't need an insane
20:47 - amount of units to break even the unless
20:49 - you need the easier it is to find
20:50 - success my next game hyper Knights is
20:52 - leaving early access is Friday I've
20:54 - invested more in this game than ever
20:55 - before but not so much that it will
20:57 - never be profitable feedback has been
20:59 - extremely positive so I'm confident it
21:01 - won't reach my modest goals however I
21:03 - also know that if it sells zero copies I
21:04 - will not be out of a job and serving on
21:06 - the street I won't analyze what went
21:08 - wrong and make an educated decision on
21:10 - what to work on next how long to work on
21:12 - it and how much to spend yeah it's a
21:14 - funny reading this all these years
21:15 - afterwards so hyper Knights that one
21:18 - didn't leave early access and in terms
21:19 - of review views and reviews were still
21:21 - extremely positive it is one of the
21:22 - highest rated games that I've ever made
21:24 - but in terms of sales suddenly it didn't
21:26 - do quite as well as I would like like I
21:28 - said I've invested more in this game
21:29 - than ever before but not so much that it
21:31 - will never be profitable so I did spend
21:33 - quite a lot I hired an artist I worked
21:35 - on it to make all kinds of art make the
21:36 - same page make game art make all kinds
21:38 - of stuff I even got some custom sound
21:40 - and all kinds of other things so I
21:42 - invested quite a bit on this game at
21:43 - least relative to my other games in the
21:45 - end it did not sell quite as much as I
21:47 - would like but given how even though I
21:49 - spent more I didn't necessarily spend an
21:51 - insane amount I think I spent I don't
21:52 - know maybe like 20 30 grand something
21:54 - like that and the game did return just
21:56 - about that so it wasn't a huge hit but
21:57 - it was definitely profitable and again
21:59 - back then this was I don't know my sixth
22:01 - game maybe and like I said I don't
22:03 - really spend much money so all the other
22:04 - games that I made some were successful
22:06 - some were less successful but the ones
22:08 - that were successful since my burn rate
22:10 - is so low I didn't manage to gather
22:12 - quite a lot of nice savings so I was at
22:13 - a point where even a hyper Knight stolen
22:15 - literally zero copies even if that were
22:17 - to happen I would not starve I had
22:19 - enough savings to be be able to survive
22:20 - for another one two three games okay I
22:22 - hope this article provides some
22:24 - perspective on the unless exciting but
22:25 - more reasonable and sustainable type of
22:27 - indie game development thanks for
22:28 - reading alright yeah so here it is this
22:30 - article reading it six years later and
22:32 - yep everything is still pretty much
22:34 - accurate nowadays things are quite a bit
22:36 - more difficult seem is even more
22:37 - centering but this advice is really
22:39 - Timeless advice so yeah it was fun to
22:41 - read through this all over again
22:42 - definitely an interesting article and I
22:44 - definitely hope that reading through
22:45 - this helps you on your own personal Game
22:47 - Dev Journey alright so thanks for
22:49 - watching and I'll see you next time
23:04 - [Music]
23:06 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a really interesting article titled sustainable living as an indie bottom feeder so basically can you make a living whilst not being a famous Indie Dev this was written all the way back in 2017 and look at that look at the author Yep this was written exactly by me six years ago and this is telling my story so let's read through it and see if everything that I've said back then still makes sense still is applicable nowadays so howdy my name is cardos I'm the developer behind the one man in the studio and on slope Studios and you've probably never heard of me my story isn't sexy I didn't quit my job and work on a masterpiece for five years while living on Ramen I'm not an autor making a game that won't change the world and make people tattoo the name on their forehead my car is 12 years old my phone is 4 years old my apartment is boringly normal on a second world country my games Don't Get Hype previews on kataku or polygon they don't have a metacritosaur they don't get reviewed on IGN or rock paper Shopkin they don't get covered by Turtle biscuit or Giant Bomb but despite all that I've been running a sustainable business since 2013. so yeah right away all of this is still applicable to my myself nowadays I have made over eight games on Steam those games have sold hundreds of thousands of copies they've made over one million dollars in Gross and yet like it says here you've probably never heard of me so most people do not know the name endless loop Studios I am definitely not a famous Dev but I have been doing this as a sustainable business since 2013. and yeah it's funny to read this six years afterwards since then I have upgraded my car I used to have a Hyundai Getz now I've got a nucleo the car is from 2017 so I guess I've got a 60 year old car now my phone I've also upgraded but it's also about four years old now still live in the same apartment still in the same country and if my games still don't get high previews I'm currently working on my next team game dinky Guardians and for that game I highly doubt that it's going to be covered on Kotaku or polygon but I'm still quite confident that it won't be financially viable same so far all this yep still applicable nowadays so let's continue reading here's a nice screenshot from one of my first games gamecorp DX that is one of my most successful games it was made pretty quickly it's a relatively short game but the response was awesome the game is pretty cheap and everybody who buys it the reviews are still insanely positive nowadays so that was a great game so continuing my role models are more than likes of clay fairies from positive games and Jeff vogels spider web software rather than Eric Brown from stardew Valley or Toby Fox from undertale if you're looking to be in developer long term I fully believe the trick is quantity of sufficient quality so you have this ice don't very much agree with the sentiment obviously stardew Valley and undertale and those two are absolute masterpieces but they were also extremely risky gambons both these I think to more than five years each of them to the phone that is really risky spending five years working on just one game of course when it does go well then you get massively rewarded so both these developers they are insanely successful they can do whatever they want basically with one game they essentially won the lottery but personally I do not like to gamble my livelihood on the lottery I prefer more stable things so that is why Cliff Harris he is developer behind democracy so that was a huge hit also made production line also really great he got into publishing and started publishing some games made big Pharma also published created the Space Battles that was another big hit a long time ago we're doing the sync battles that was also interesting and for Jeff Hogan with spider web software there's all kinds of very strange very Niche oldschool RPGs he has made a ton of them and over the years has developed a very dedicated audience that buys pretty much any game as long as it fits that Niche there is an excellent GDC tone that I highly recommend you go and look at so like I said here I've only believe the trick is primarily quantity of sufficient quality rather than risking your whole life on pushing the quality as much as possible I'm a big fan of trying to lower the rest so you can actually keep doing this for the long term so as with any business there won't be ups and downs I expected my second game to do as well as the first and as a result I invested way too much time and money and when sales were way below the first one I panicked quite a bit and I became concerned about the viability of indie game development as a sustainable longterm career so yeah this definitely happened to me my first game Survivor Squad was surprisingly successful back then green light had just started so steam wasn't yet as much saturated as it is right now and that game that game idea that concept for some reason that really resonated with people so that game definitely sound a lot more than I expected but the second game server scored gun toys which was a direct sequel that one suddenly did not do as well I worked on that game a lot more I believe it is a better game in literally every single way but for some reason the market didn't like it steam didn't really care for it so that game I think it's only literally one tenth despite taking longer to make and despite investing a lot more time on buying art and all kinds of things so yeah when that second game flew up that really scared me quite a bit and like I said here as a result I did the best safest thing that I could do I spent three months remaking my most successful Flash game and made a tiny cheap highly focused highly polished game which found quite a bit of success which then helped me develop my fourth game and so on that game that I'm talking about that was gamecorp DX which yep the original game the original Flash game was called gamecorp it came out before I started getting into unity and making Steam games so I guess came out in I don't know 2011 maybe 2012 and that game was highly successful in the flash game or rather I should say highly successful in terms of players and gameplays definitely not highly successful in terms of monetary Revenue flash is really difficult The Flash version of the game was actually played six million times that is an insane amount I can't even imagine six million people playing my game but has resulted in financial terms that game only made about a thousand dollars whereas a remake that I made on scene that I sold for three bucks that one made something like a hundred thousand foreign flash was definitely an interesting thing I definitely learned a lot from it but in financial terms it was incredibly difficult okay so here are some tips that have helped me along the way tip number one keep your burn rate as low as possible absolutely great tip I definitely still believe in this nowadays I'll start with the most obvious one although also the most difficult one to use since it is very much based on where you live if I was living in San Francisco spending 4K a month just to stay afloat then I wouldn't be able to do this you can make a decent tight small polish game in six months and if your burn rate is 4K then that one cost you 24K whereas if the burn rate is just a thousand then it will only cost you six thousand so yeah difference between 24K and 6K that is difference between requiring something like 500 sales to make a living versus requiring something like five thousand if you can live on a thousand dollars a month you can make a really tight polish twohour game for six thousand dollars and assuming the game is of sufficient quality that is an achievable amount to sell say at this one I really do believe this is one of the let's say secrets that have allowed me to become an indie Dev the fact that I live in a relatively lowcost living and personally I don't really spend money on anything I don't really care about buying fancy clothes fancy watches fancy cars whatever I don't really care much for them except when I first moved out of my parents house and I started Living by myself I was living as cheaply as possible and I was living around 750 bucks a month so that is why I managed to essentially become a sustainable in developer If instead I was burning through four thousand dollars a month if I was doing that then it would be much more difficult to just basically stay afloat so here continuing Survivor Squad took 10 months to make I was living with my parents and I didn't really go out much or do anything so my Burden rate was essentially zero dollars yep that's correct I did the programming Art and Design myself I spent 350 bucks on hosting royalty free sound effects and the green light fee so do you think that game was profitable the answer is yes of course of course it was I don't know the number off the top of my head but I'm sure that game made over 50k so again spending 350 bucks and 10 months of my life for 50k that is definitely very easily to make profitable which again would be very different if I had spent 4K a month that would be very different math all of a sudden that would not become profitable so here don't demo your life on the expectation that your game won't sell a hundred thousand copies you might think well Sim has 140 million users how hard can it be to sell to just point one percent of that and the answer is that it's extremely hard very very hard always be hyper aware of survivorship bias everyone knows tardy Valley's own millions of copies but nobody knows the 200 other games that were released that month and made either nothing or a very small reasonable amount you can look it seem spy and look at the games in a similar genre and price Point's yours so could you survive to make another game if you sold just 5 000 copies what about 3 000 with the trick only of three companies a day combined with your savings be enough to help you make another game yep these are all still very valid questions nowadays the only difference is that nowadays things are even more difficult so nowadays I'm pretty sure there's a lot more than just 200 games released per month I think unless I checked I think last year there were some like 15 000 games so that actually means around a thousand games per month now of course some of those are Chevron wear but a lot of those are actually very high quality games and seem now has a lot more millions of users I don't know what is the total but just recently I think they hit 30 million concurrent active users so the total number of users that is an insane amount but at the same time most of those will only see the top games so most of the 1000 games that come out every single month most people will never see any of those same point of this that I wrote back in 2017 this is definitely still accurate nowadays if anything nowadays it is even more difficult start as small as you can focus on a tiny scope and make a tiny product of good quality players much prefer to have a small 2 hour interesting quality experience rather than a 40 hour messy game with many bugs no polish and a dozen meaningless Channel features your goal should be to design a game that when a player finishes they want more rather than something huge that no one will play because they won't get bored and frustrated within the first hour yep that is some generally very good advice making something small tight and Polished that is going to be much better rather than something that technically has hundreds of hours of gameplay but those are all very low quality however at the same time don't push this to the absolute extreme if you make a game that just has one hour of gameplay even if that gameplay is really excellent that might be not enough to justify whatever cost is for the game there are always going to be some people who play games sub two hours and just refund them but those are usually up wires if your game has at least two hours of content and if those two hours are excellent then those people will probably be very happy and the game can be quite successful and here use Early Access for feedback not for funding Early Access is awesome I've used it for all except my first game getting people to play your game ahead of an official launch is extremely important especially if you're keeping your costs as low as possible and don't want to hire professional testers unless you already have a builtin audience or press valve contacts Early Access is not for funding you will likely not be featured on the popular new release list and will likely only sell a few hundred or maybe 1 000 copies depending on the price however make sure your early asset release is in a decent State as an unknown in developer the simmer V score is the most important thing that will help you selling copies and you must defend their own costs if you're only using internally access with many nasty bugs under the guise of it's just an alpha it says over right on the same page you only get negative reviews and even if you fix those issues within 24 hours those reviews will still stay there and keep your score down forever as for feedback be very active in responding to comments and put out updates consistently yep all of this still excellent advice nowadays Early Access is definitely for feedback definitely not for funding if you're going into Early Access with the hopes of getting the funding to actually finish your game that is a terrible plan that will not work nowadays Early Access is even more difficult people are even more demanding so back then back in 2017 if you put our game on Early Access people would kind of accept a few bugs here and there and a lack of content whereas nowadays they do not nowadays if you put out something on Early Access it better be extremely well polished so nowadays it does not need to be in a decent state it needs to be in an excellent state with quite a lot of content already and yet like I said back then steam review score is the most important thing and yep that is absolutely true that is still very much correct nowadays if you come out of the gate with only access with a subparent release and if the reviews come out negative coming back from that is essentially impossible and like I said here you won't get negative reviews and even if you fix those issues within 24 hours the reviews will likely stay there and keep your score down forever there's certainly something that I know very very well there was one of my games where I actually forgot to add a folder on the Mac build like on the game I forgot to test does the founder exist it just assumed that the founder existed and on the build that I uploaded the same I forgot to add that folder so essentially on Mac the game was homily broken now as soon as the game came out I saw our view right away that said the game was broken on Mac it does not work right away I looked into the logs I saw that was a problem very easy fix so I fixed it super quickly literally within less than one hour of release I fixed that I did respond to that review and I said okay this has been fixed but the person who wrote that review they never bothered to update it so one tiny tiny issue that was fixed within 30 minutes of release even though I did fix it the review is still there it still drags down the score nowadays so reviews are extremely important and going into Early Access does not give you a reason to not worry too much people in Early Access expect the same level of Polish as a final game so absolutely do not use Early Access for funding and absolutely do not go with the mindset of it just announced it says on the same page people do not care if it is their only access people only expect a very well very polished very robust game with tons of content valid in long tail Yep this is extremely important since I look at my business as a longterm Venture I've only been long tail tremendously even my first game Survivor Squad which has a mixed review score still sells a handful of copies every month certainly not enough to live on but it does add up what that really means is that as long as I keep my burn rate low I don't need a game to break even super quickly as long as my costs were low enough that break even is achievable it's only a matter of time Yep this is absolutely true I mean nowadays it has been over 10 years since I watched my first team game and it still sounds copies now obviously it doesn't sound too much nowadays the long tail that definitely does go down over time but still nowadays it still probably sells I don't know maybe a hundred bucks a month maybe something like that maybe 50 bucks so either way that game that I made over 10 years ago that one still pays for some groceries nowadays and of course that's only just one game so put all the games together and the long tail can be quite good even though nowadays my last scene game came out all the way back in 2019 so that was quite time ago so my steam Revenue has definitely dropped off quite significantly since all of those years ago but still it is still more than zero so all those games that I made all those years ago they still work nowadays and like I said if my burn rate is low which nowadays it still is it's a bit higher than it was all the way back then but it's not that much higher so the small amount that I still get paid from seam that still helps me cover quite a lot of costs for my daily life take it easy on discounts they are useful tool to find new players at different price points but don't go overboard and bundling your game for one dollar within three months of release just make a quick Buck stay strong and keep your eye on the long term Yep this is another thing as soon as you launch a game you won't get tons and tons of messages and emails from all kinds of obscure bundle sites they won't promise to you bundle your game and sometimes of copies but each of those copies you are only going to get literally something like 10 cents out of each of them and as soon as you bundle the game once some people look at that and they basically assume okay so this is the value that the game is worth nowadays the better strategy is really just discount your game nice and slowly over time once again goes back to what I was talking about the burner it if your burn rate is low and you're okay with spending a bit more time to actually break even if you're okay with that if that is sustainable to you then you can afford to essentially discount much slower so just discount 25 for the first six months then maybe just fifty percent on the second year and maybe on the third year or fourth year maybe you can go all the way down to 75 if you do that it won't take a bit longer to get the revenue but again if you can afford a burn rate over a long time in the end that won't be a better strategy always keep learning and growing yep right away obviously I agree with this I mean nowadays I have the channel and part of the reason why I created this channel was because I really wanted to keep learning things keep doing all kinds of things and I wanted sort of an excuse to force myself to do that so this channel making tutorials covering all kinds of unity and Game Dev content that is pretty much Mike's use to keep learning keep doing things I just think to myself I would like to teach this sort of thing make this sort of mechanic in a tutorial and if I want to teach it in a tutorial I need to know it myself very well so yep I'm definitely still very much a Believer on always keep learning and growing then the game development scene moves at a very fast pace it's seems that the game changes every six months so you have to adapt are you making a platformer with nice art it was easier to send out five years ago making a zombie crafting Survival game easier three years ago a king of the hill game easier one year ago yeah there are definitely some fads that come and go and some genres become way too oversaturated like for example making a platform with nice art nowadays in order to stand out you need to have something on the level of something like cuphead so it has to be that special to really stand out Platformers are a dime a dozen there are millions of them zombie crafting Survival game that one is actually not necessarily A Century I mean there are tons and tons of them but people can't seem to get enough of them so that's a genre that is also very saturated but can still work and King of the Hill game honestly nowadays I don't even know exactly what this refers to was there a big amount of King of the Hill games back in 2017 honestly I don't remember but yeah I guess uh fads come and go game genres appear and disappear nowadays the big one is vampire survival likes there's already a ton of them but there are still some that you find success you should stay up to date with the business side of things but also your own skill are you growing as a programmer artist designer are you becoming faster at producing good content in your engine of choice do you have reusable code so your next game will be up and running faster than before do you have some extra Sprites laying around that could be used to very quickly prototype an interesting idea remember time is money yep look at that so all the way back in 17 I was already talking about the benefits of reasonable code even though this in 2017 this would have been probably before I read code complaint so probably before my skills regarding clean code really massively improved so it's kind of funny that before then I was already seeing the value of it and he has some extra Sprites laying around yep that can definitely help back then I was in too used to using the unity assessor but nowadays there are tons of stuff on the accessor so even if you don't personally have some extra Sprites lying around you can definitely pick them up some things either on the Unis or on some sale or on a Humble Bundle getting assets has never been easier and cheaper so that is great next tip gather the following this is my biggest weakness since I'm not a very social person so I'll just write about the generally accepted device be active in all types of social media I ideally you should spend as much time marketing as you do actually developing so yep that is definitely very good advice and all this is still intrude to myself nowadays I am still not a very social person if you've been following this channel for quite some time you can see how it took me in literally years to be able to gain the confidence to turn the camera on and try out this type of video so as you can see I am actively learning my advice I am actively trying to learn and grow any of social media is still extremely important and since nowadays things are even more difficult than they were back in 2017 Yep this advice about spending as much time marketing as you do developing this is even more accurate now than ever nowadays if you just focus on developing your game nobody want to see it so you do need Marketing in order to actually find the people that won't play and like your game and for that here on YouTube you can do devlogs you can try to gather an audience by making tutorials like I've done although to be fair that does generate a more Game Dev audience rather than a game playing audience so that is not a very good strategy for finding game players but you can do General devlogs you can go the entertainment route kind of like Danny that is very successful and you can obviously experiment with all the the new social medias there have been lots of any devs recently that I found tons of success on Tick Tock so Tick Tock Instagram all kinds of short content nowadays that is really useful so in general keep in mind you should spend almost as much time marketing as you do developing one thing I've done is set up a Nissan letter sign up link in all my games and their websites through it I've gathered about 4 000 emails now that obviously doesn't mean that every time I announce the game I will suddenly sell that many companies but it does mean I'm not only starting from scratch in it that is really good advice nowadays I still have that mailing list so when I recently announced thinking Guardians I did send an email to devilist I can't remember how many people are on there but still it's more than zero so it does help and again focusing on the long term every game I release and every day goes by that list increases little by a little maybe one day I'll get to the point where eclipse is so that is Cliff Aries from pasta games and I'll be able to sell 9 000 copies of a game before even hitting scene I think that was the game production line I think he made an alpha before going on to steam and that outfit was massively successful Sam if you do manage to gather a large following and large audience that enjoys your games if you gather that over many many years then things hopefully become easier and easier even if the market does become more and more centering when in doubt follow the TF2 Sniper as the wise man once said professionals have standards be polite be efficient have a plan to kill everyone you meet now we would advise replacing that last part with be prepared and have the plan to survive to fight another day if the worst possible scenario comes past but yeah whatever works for you yeah I would say this is definitely still a line that still resonates with me nowadays basically be professional if Game Dev is meant to be your career then take it as seriously as you take any job that you have an interest in make sure you have high standards with the things that you do and of course be polite there's no reason to respond negatively to anyone even negative reviews although that is quite difficult be efficient so in Practical terms this is why I talk so much about writing good clean code that is one of the best ways to get efficiency in game development and be prepared to have a plan to survive to fight another day that is why I never recommend you just quit your day job and try to bet it all on your very first game you should hopefully be honestate that if you do try to make a game and you're trying to make it successful song you should definitely not be in a position where if that game fails suddenly you go homeless and go hungry so that goes back to reducing your burn rate in order to reduce your risk in order to be able to do this for the long term as you gain experience and hopefully find more and more success in the game development is a very tough or crown business but I believe if you face reality instead of burying your head in the sand and focus on taking calculated risks you can't find success just don't define success as selling 100K units yep once again the same thing that I was saying make sure you lower your risk make sure you don't need an insane amount of units to break even the unless you need the easier it is to find success my next game hyper Knights is leaving early access is Friday I've invested more in this game than ever before but not so much that it will never be profitable feedback has been extremely positive so I'm confident it won't reach my modest goals however I also know that if it sells zero copies I will not be out of a job and serving on the street I won't analyze what went wrong and make an educated decision on what to work on next how long to work on it and how much to spend yeah it's a funny reading this all these years afterwards so hyper Knights that one didn't leave early access and in terms of review views and reviews were still extremely positive it is one of the highest rated games that I've ever made but in terms of sales suddenly it didn't do quite as well as I would like like I said I've invested more in this game than ever before but not so much that it will never be profitable so I did spend quite a lot I hired an artist I worked on it to make all kinds of art make the same page make game art make all kinds of stuff I even got some custom sound and all kinds of other things so I invested quite a bit on this game at least relative to my other games in the end it did not sell quite as much as I would like but given how even though I spent more I didn't necessarily spend an insane amount I think I spent I don't know maybe like 20 30 grand something like that and the game did return just about that so it wasn't a huge hit but it was definitely profitable and again back then this was I don't know my sixth game maybe and like I said I don't really spend much money so all the other games that I made some were successful some were less successful but the ones that were successful since my burn rate is so low I didn't manage to gather quite a lot of nice savings so I was at a point where even a hyper Knight stolen literally zero copies even if that were to happen I would not starve I had enough savings to be be able to survive for another one two three games okay I hope this article provides some perspective on the unless exciting but more reasonable and sustainable type of indie game development thanks for reading alright yeah so here it is this article reading it six years later and yep everything is still pretty much accurate nowadays things are quite a bit more difficult seem is even more centering but this advice is really Timeless advice so yeah it was fun to read through this all over again definitely an interesting article and I definitely hope that reading through this helps you on your own personal Game Dev Journey alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
