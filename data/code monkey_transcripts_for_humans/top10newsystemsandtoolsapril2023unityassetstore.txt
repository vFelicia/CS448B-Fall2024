00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the SSR is full of awesome tones and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - I'm gonna check out some highlights for
00:09 - apron 23. this one is a list of paid
00:11 - systems and two owns in the last video
00:13 - I'm already covered the best three new
00:14 - assets and next one I will cover top
00:15 - visions and effects as always there's
00:17 - links to the ads in the description and
00:18 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
00:19 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order this
00:21 - video is sponsored by gamedev Guild this
00:24 - is a 5 Day online Game Dev conference
00:26 - specifically tailored for Unity devs and
00:28 - focus on giving you practical actionable
00:30 - usable advice watch over 35 Tonks from
00:32 - industry experts including Unity Co John
00:35 - riccatello Jason Wyman Thomas brush
00:37 - lionelux turbo mixed games and many more
00:39 - join the virtual expo hall where you can
00:41 - walk around visit booths and network
00:43 - with people using the integrated
00:45 - proximity chat the ticket also includes
00:47 - over two thousand dollars worth of free
00:49 - bonuses including some very useful
00:51 - assets and some subscription to tools
00:53 - like Unity Pro and jetprint's writer and
00:55 - there is also a free one day pass which
00:57 - includes free access to all the sessions
00:58 - from the first day it starts on May 1st
01:01 - until the 5th so if you want to improve
01:03 - your yinty gamedev skills check it out
01:04 - to the link in the description and use
01:06 - the coupon code monkey20 to get a nice
01:07 - 20 discount alright so starting off with
01:10 - a really impressive rope tool it looks
01:12 - extremely natural very impressive the
01:14 - ropes can sway back and forth they are
01:16 - connected in various ways you can
01:18 - connect ropes to other ropes you can
01:20 - push them around you can modify the mesh
01:22 - to simulate some chains you can even
01:23 - drag some objects with ropes attach them
01:25 - to an object and even bend it so really
01:27 - it has tons of possibility adding
01:29 - something like this really helps the
01:30 - game feel much more natural adding these
01:32 - kinds of tiny physics always makes it
01:34 - look great it runs on your GPU so it's
01:36 - extremely performant allowing you to
01:37 - have tons and tons of ropes in your game
01:39 - next up we have a fun one it's a
01:41 - volumetric hit map you define a volume
01:43 - and size it then you can add data at any
01:45 - point inside that volume and easily
01:47 - visualize it in multiple ways the data
01:49 - is just a simple list of vector 3 which
01:51 - you can populate in any way you want so
01:53 - perhaps it's your player's movement
01:54 - pattern perhaps it's in a list of where
01:56 - the players died maybe wear some coins
01:58 - were either spent or acquire it's a
02:00 - really nice data visualization tool
02:02 - which could definitely help you as a
02:03 - developer in order to analyze some
02:04 - gameplay or you could include it in your
02:06 - game so your players can visualize their
02:08 - own data and learn how to play better
02:09 - then here we have a nice enemy AI system
02:12 - perfect for any kind of stealthy game
02:13 - you define the enemy Patrol areas you
02:16 - can throw things to distract some cards
02:17 - they won't walk there and go into
02:19 - another state it features a cover system
02:21 - where enemies will not see you if behind
02:23 - cover then over time their alert level
02:24 - goes down although if you do get spotted
02:26 - they start shooting other enemies can
02:28 - listen to the shooting and attack the
02:29 - player so you could see this as being an
02:31 - excellent starting point if you want to
02:32 - build a nice stealthy game kind of like
02:34 - Splinter Cell up next here is an
02:35 - interesting tool that can be very useful
02:37 - if you use any external assets it's a
02:39 - mesh extractor so you can grab any
02:41 - assets you have maybe from an asset pack
02:43 - then you can click to select only the
02:45 - parts of data that you want and you can
02:47 - extract them onto their own separate
02:49 - mesh it definitely looks like a very
02:50 - useful tool I've needed to do this exact
02:52 - thing a bunch of times and the only way
02:54 - that I knew how to do that was using Pro
02:56 - Builder however Pro Builder the cut to
02:58 - only is quite a bit janky it always has
02:59 - has some issues whereas this one seems
03:02 - to work perfectly in every scenario you
03:03 - can extract the mesh position the pivot
03:05 - extract the textures and Export it as an
03:07 - obj definitely a very useful tool to
03:09 - have in your tone box up next is another
03:11 - very useful tool this one is for
03:13 - painting meshes so you pick up a mesh
03:15 - any mesh then you can simply use the
03:17 - mouse to select individual polygons and
03:19 - paint them with a different material
03:20 - this can be especially useful if you
03:22 - don't like using a low poly Style just
03:24 - like I do it works great for selecting
03:26 - each individual polygon and painting
03:27 - them in any way it works on static
03:29 - meshes as well as on skin meshes so for
03:31 - example if you have some character and
03:33 - you want to change the visual without
03:34 - changing the entire material then with
03:35 - this you can just select the parts you
03:37 - want and color them differently it's
03:38 - simple and does exactly what you want
03:40 - next up if you want to make some node
03:42 - based visuals check out this one it
03:43 - helps you create your own node-based
03:45 - elements during runtime so this one is
03:47 - not an additive tool for making notes
03:48 - rather it works in game so perhaps you
03:51 - could use it for drawing something like
03:52 - a circuit board or maybe some waypoints
03:54 - maybe you could include it in your game
03:55 - with some kind of Muddy tools to allow
03:57 - the player to create some custom AI or
03:59 - something you can click and drag to move
04:01 - some nodes either remove some
04:02 - connections Define input and output
04:04 - points and Visually it looks really nice
04:06 - with some animated errors and dynamic
04:08 - shapes and the nodes themselves you can
04:09 - also change the visual so they can be
04:11 - just squares or really any visual you
04:12 - want definitely very interesting tool
04:14 - then if you want to generate a ton of
04:16 - trees and look at this one it features a
04:18 - ton of generation settings all of them
04:19 - based on sliders or Curves which makes
04:21 - it really easy to quickly iterate the
04:23 - results are certainly very unique lots
04:25 - of different types that you can create
04:26 - if you need even more control you can
04:28 - also modify the actual tree mesh itself
04:30 - it includes some animated shaders so the
04:32 - trees can move with the wind and also
04:34 - includes a placement tool so you can
04:35 - Define some settings to generate
04:37 - something and then easily Place hundreds
04:38 - of them in the world up next we have a
04:40 - nice flocking algorithm you can spawn
04:42 - some objects and watch as they flock
04:43 - together and move around now these
04:45 - objects can be whatever you want so
04:47 - perhaps they are birds flying around or
04:48 - maybe fish swimming they flock around in
04:50 - a nice satisfying manner there is a CPU
04:53 - and a GPU implementation worse on both
04:54 - 2D and 3D then if you have some
04:56 - performance issues with your game you
04:58 - should probably be using LEDs if you
05:00 - don't want to build them yourself then
05:01 - this zone for generating them in runtime
05:03 - can definitely help the generation is
05:05 - extremely seamless I cannot notice when
05:07 - they swap at all it works on both static
05:09 - as well as Skin meshes it's super easy
05:11 - use just drop a script on your object
05:12 - and that's it it uses a native library
05:14 - for mesh generation so it's all super
05:16 - fast then here is a very interesting one
05:18 - that could definitely be very useful it
05:20 - helps you easily add tabs for just about
05:22 - anything you can make a tab for a
05:24 - specific game object or a certain folder
05:26 - you can create new tabs shifts between
05:27 - them or close them it's a simple tool
05:29 - that does exactly what you expect
05:30 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:33 - and systems on the NTS store for April
05:34 - 23 there's only so in the description
05:36 - and as bonus you can use a coupon code
05:38 - monkey tend to get 10 off your earning
05:39 - also check out my own free and paid
05:41 - Aston store alright hope that's useful
05:43 - and check out these videos to learn some
05:45 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
05:47 - supporters for making these videos
05:48 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
05:50 - see you next time
05:54 - foreign
