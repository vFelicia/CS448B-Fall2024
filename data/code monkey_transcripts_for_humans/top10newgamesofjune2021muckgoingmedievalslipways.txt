00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for june 2021
00:06 - there's tons of awesome games this month
00:08 - almost all of them with thousands of
00:09 - extremely positive reviews
00:11 - so on the one hand it's awesome you've
00:12 - got tons of great games to play
00:14 - but on the other hand if you're an indie
00:16 - game developer then this is your very
00:17 - very tough competition
00:19 - so if you really want to be successful
00:20 - in the game developer you really need to
00:22 - bring your a game
00:23 - all these games are uniquely impressive
00:25 - and they showcase the power of the
00:26 - engine
00:26 - in terms of different scenarios so the
00:28 - list is in no particular order
00:30 - except for the number one game that is
00:31 - my personal pick of the month
00:33 - easily build games with this video's
00:34 - sponsor core core is a free game
00:37 - creation platform that lets you build
00:38 - and publish your games
00:40 - it is great for very quickly and very
00:42 - easily prototyping any ideas you have
00:44 - and it is especially easy to build
00:46 - multiplayer games since all of the
00:48 - complicated networking parts are all
00:49 - handled automatically
00:51 - you have thousands of free high quality
00:52 - sound and art assets to build your game
00:54 - you can build the entire games without
00:56 - code or if you want to take it further
00:58 - you can write your own custom game logic
01:00 - using lua
01:01 - once you have your game built you just
01:02 - click a button and it's instantly
01:04 - available for anyone to play
01:05 - also core is having an exciting event
01:07 - this week it's a collaboration with dead
01:09 - mouse featuring a 50
01:10 - 000 price pool and some very special
01:12 - prices like in lifetime pass and a meet
01:14 - and greet
01:15 - it ends in just one week so go ahead
01:17 - click the link in the description for a
01:18 - chance to be featured in that mouse's
01:20 - next music video
01:21 - now before i actually cover the list let
01:23 - me start off with an honorable mention
01:25 - here is probably the most popular game
01:27 - this month muk
01:29 - normally i don't cover free to play
01:30 - games on these lists but this is such a
01:32 - huge hit that i really can't ignore it
01:34 - as of right now it has 40 000 insanely
01:37 - positive reviews which means around 2
01:38 - million players that's insane
01:41 - this is made by denny who has a huge
01:42 - following on youtube
01:44 - it's a survival roguelike game where you
01:46 - collect resources find items build the
01:48 - base and survive
01:50 - so it's a pretty simple gameplay loop
01:51 - but it's coupled with some really
01:53 - charming visuals
01:54 - a bunch of multiplayer and some very
01:55 - polished effects and again it's
01:57 - completely free so very impressive
01:59 - alright so starting off for real at
02:01 - number 10 with this really unique game
02:03 - operation tango it's a two-player co-op
02:06 - spy adventure game
02:08 - the really unique thing is how each
02:09 - player has a completely different
02:11 - experience
02:12 - so one player plays as the agent roaming
02:14 - around level complaining objectives in
02:16 - first person
02:17 - while the other player plays as the
02:19 - hacker which can interact with the level
02:21 - and do things like
02:22 - override the elevator controls find
02:23 - access codes and a bunch more
02:26 - the tricky thing is they can only
02:27 - communicate with voice so the hacker
02:29 - needs to give the correct instructions
02:31 - to the agent for both of them to succeed
02:32 - the mission
02:33 - as always any game that requires
02:35 - constant communication like this is
02:36 - bound to generate a lot of hilarious
02:38 - moments
02:39 - so it's one of those that it's
02:40 - guaranteed to be a great time with
02:42 - friends
02:42 - it's also got a great visual style i
02:44 - really like it makes me think of austin
02:46 - powers
02:47 - oh and also the game has a really
02:48 - awesome friend pass so
02:50 - only one person needs to own the game
02:51 - and both of you can play
02:53 - and on top of that there's also cross
02:54 - play nemo so all in all very awesome
02:57 - then we have going medieval it's a
02:59 - medieval
03:00 - colony building sim game construct your
03:02 - fortress and keep it safe
03:04 - from raids also keep your villagers nice
03:06 - happy and fed
03:07 - the game takes place in the 14th century
03:09 - just after the play has decimated 95
03:12 - of the population so over time the
03:14 - survivors come out and it's up to you to
03:15 - give them a great feature
03:17 - you start off small with a small wooden
03:19 - hut and use the intuitive 3d terrain
03:21 - tool in order to build your massive
03:22 - multi-story fort
03:24 - harvest some resources hunt a bunch of
03:25 - animals and stay safe from the elements
03:28 - set up your guard posts and defend from
03:29 - the raiders when they come it just came
03:31 - out in early access this month but
03:33 - already has over 4 000 very positive
03:35 - reviews
03:36 - it seems this is one of the biggest hits
03:38 - this month they also have a very
03:40 - detailed road map in the store page
03:42 - it includes tons of features like
03:44 - trading a prisoner system
03:46 - raiding some other settlements animal
03:48 - husbandry and much more
03:50 - so this seems like a great start and it
03:51 - will be even better one year from now
03:54 - then if you want something really
03:55 - satisfying here is lego builder's
03:57 - journey

04:07 - pieces look perfect
04:08 - it's all of it thanks to some awesome
04:10 - ray trace rendering
04:11 - unity has been partnering with lego for
04:13 - a bunch of things so i wonder if we'll
04:15 - see this one more in some future unite

04:20 - must use the in lego pieces to move your
04:22 - character and reach the end of the level

05:09 - from real life
05:11 - i love drifting in car games but i've

05:18 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
05:19 - thing but really does help
05:21 - thanks next up we have slipways it's a
05:24 - sci-fi strategy game you start off with
05:26 - a bunch of planets and you connect them
05:28 - together in order to build a vast
05:29 - trading empire
05:30 - combine unique worlds with some
05:32 - interesting tech in order to keep that
05:33 - trade income constantly flowing
05:35 - research some new tech and use wormholes
05:37 - to traverse this universe
05:39 - it's a purely economical game there's no
05:41 - combat so it's all about making the
05:44 - right decisions in a relaxing but
05:45 - engaging experience
05:47 - there's no need for war with so much
05:48 - empty universe to claim
05:50 - every action has immediate consequences
05:52 - so there's no busy work waiting for
05:54 - ships to be built
05:55 - you just place down trade routes and
05:56 - watch the money roll in the game
05:58 - is very well polished with tons of
06:00 - flashy effects on every action making it
06:02 - all
06:02 - extremely satisfying so all in all it
06:05 - seems they thought very hard about
06:06 - making a very unique design
06:08 - and based on the very positive reviews i
06:10 - would say they succeeded
06:11 - then if you're looking for some vr here
06:13 - is eternal starlight vr
06:16 - it's an interesting strategy game being
06:18 - in vr you essentially have a home view
06:20 - of the battlefield
06:21 - and then you can zoom in to experience
06:23 - the conflict from any scale
06:25 - so you zoom out to see the whole
06:27 - conflict or zoom all the way in to see
06:29 - each individual ship component
06:31 - manage and customize your ships and give
06:32 - them the correct equipment for the
06:34 - battle ahead
06:35 - make some good decisions and lead your
06:36 - fleet to victory by telling them where
06:38 - to go and who to attack
06:40 - also features an intuitive locomotion
06:42 - system you can move freely through space
06:44 - just by grabbing it
06:45 - supports playing seated standing or in
06:47 - full room scale
06:49 - up next we have spellcaster university
06:52 - it's an interesting management game
06:53 - where you run
06:54 - a prestigious university of mages so you
06:57 - build a bunch of rooms you train your
06:58 - students
06:59 - fight orcs lay the bureaucrats and
07:01 - manage the budget you must handle the
07:02 - well-being of your students by building
07:04 - a good university
07:06 - push them towards a glorious future and
07:08 - win some new bonuses
07:09 - then you go out on quests and fight off
07:11 - monsters using all of your abilities
07:14 - it uses a deck system to define what
07:16 - type of magic your
07:17 - university won't teach so you can choose
07:20 - to teach some black magic with
07:21 - necromancy and demonology
07:23 - or make it nice and harmonious with a
07:25 - bunch of druids and shamans
07:27 - it seems like an interesting system
07:29 - mixing a sort of deck builder with a
07:31 - management game
07:32 - it's got a lot of very positive reviews
07:34 - especially for what seems like a
07:36 - somewhat niche game
07:37 - management with mages so it must be
07:39 - really good for a gorgeous
07:41 - side-scrolling game there's until we die
07:44 - build your base equip your crew and go
07:46 - down into the mines
07:47 - it feels simultaneously old-school with
07:49 - its visuals but with some modern
07:50 - gameplay
07:51 - you play as ivan the commander and lead
07:53 - your units to battle
07:55 - they're not very smart so it's up to you
07:56 - to tell them what to do in this nice mix
07:58 - of action and strategy
08:00 - make sure you build some strong
08:01 - fortifications and research better tech
08:03 - to keep the enemy onslaught at bay
08:06 - the clock is ticking you must survive
08:07 - for 30 days against an every increasing
08:09 - wave of enemy attacks
08:11 - up next if you like some massive chaos
08:13 - here is geometry arena
08:15 - it's just mountains and mountains of
08:17 - flashing lights and projectiles
08:19 - everywhere
08:20 - the visuals are very minimalist the
08:22 - store page even says you play as a shape
08:24 - and you fight other shapes it's got an
08:26 - emphasis
08:27 - on building massively overpowered
08:29 - character also features some rope-like
08:31 - elements
08:32 - you can mix and match mod upgrades and
08:34 - experiment with a limitless rune upgrade
08:36 - system
08:37 - i must say that personally i'm not
08:38 - usually a fan of bullet hell games
08:40 - i always just suck at them but this one
08:43 - has over 1 000 overwhelmingly positive
08:45 - reviews so i just couldn't ignore it
08:48 - it's 97 positive which makes it one of
08:50 - the best rated games on steam
08:52 - so it's on my genre but if you're into
08:54 - bone health then definitely give this
08:55 - one a shot
08:56 - and lastly for something a bit more dark
08:58 - and gritty here is my personal pick of
09:00 - the month
09:00 - the last spell i'll have to look on this
09:03 - one really high quality pixel art
09:05 - the ui especially looks gorgeous it's a
09:08 - really nice mix of tons of genres
09:10 - so you've got turn-based combat you've
09:12 - got a bunch of city building
09:13 - then some strategy defense some
09:15 - rogue-like elements for replayability
09:17 - and tons of rpg stats you exterminate
09:20 - some fiendish monsters using magic and
09:23 - brute force by night
09:24 - and then rebuild your defenses during
09:26 - the day it seems like a really
09:28 - interesting combo of mechanics
09:29 - i especially like the turn-based defense
09:32 - combat
09:33 - usually in defense games like they are
09:35 - billions i end up getting really
09:36 - stressed out and totally overwhelmed
09:38 - when there's a massive amount of enemies
09:40 - so by making a turn base and having some
09:42 - time to think might just be the perfect
09:44 - thing that i need
09:45 - alright so that's 10 awesome new games
09:47 - made with unity and launched in june
09:48 - 2021
09:50 - if you want to be a successful indie
09:51 - game developer you definitely need to
09:53 - keep an eye on the current state of your
09:54 - competition
09:55 - i make these videos once a month so i
09:57 - can keep up to date with what's coming
09:59 - out and you should too

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for june 2021 there's tons of awesome games this month almost all of them with thousands of extremely positive reviews so on the one hand it's awesome you've got tons of great games to play but on the other hand if you're an indie game developer then this is your very very tough competition so if you really want to be successful in the game developer you really need to bring your a game all these games are uniquely impressive and they showcase the power of the engine in terms of different scenarios so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month easily build games with this video's sponsor core core is a free game creation platform that lets you build and publish your games it is great for very quickly and very easily prototyping any ideas you have and it is especially easy to build multiplayer games since all of the complicated networking parts are all handled automatically you have thousands of free high quality sound and art assets to build your game you can build the entire games without code or if you want to take it further you can write your own custom game logic using lua once you have your game built you just click a button and it's instantly available for anyone to play also core is having an exciting event this week it's a collaboration with dead mouse featuring a 50 000 price pool and some very special prices like in lifetime pass and a meet and greet it ends in just one week so go ahead click the link in the description for a chance to be featured in that mouse's next music video now before i actually cover the list let me start off with an honorable mention here is probably the most popular game this month muk normally i don't cover free to play games on these lists but this is such a huge hit that i really can't ignore it as of right now it has 40 000 insanely positive reviews which means around 2 million players that's insane this is made by denny who has a huge following on youtube it's a survival roguelike game where you collect resources find items build the base and survive so it's a pretty simple gameplay loop but it's coupled with some really charming visuals a bunch of multiplayer and some very polished effects and again it's completely free so very impressive alright so starting off for real at number 10 with this really unique game operation tango it's a twoplayer coop spy adventure game the really unique thing is how each player has a completely different experience so one player plays as the agent roaming around level complaining objectives in first person while the other player plays as the hacker which can interact with the level and do things like override the elevator controls find access codes and a bunch more the tricky thing is they can only communicate with voice so the hacker needs to give the correct instructions to the agent for both of them to succeed the mission as always any game that requires constant communication like this is bound to generate a lot of hilarious moments so it's one of those that it's guaranteed to be a great time with friends it's also got a great visual style i really like it makes me think of austin powers oh and also the game has a really awesome friend pass so only one person needs to own the game and both of you can play and on top of that there's also cross play nemo so all in all very awesome then we have going medieval it's a medieval colony building sim game construct your fortress and keep it safe from raids also keep your villagers nice happy and fed the game takes place in the 14th century just after the play has decimated 95 of the population so over time the survivors come out and it's up to you to give them a great feature you start off small with a small wooden hut and use the intuitive 3d terrain tool in order to build your massive multistory fort
