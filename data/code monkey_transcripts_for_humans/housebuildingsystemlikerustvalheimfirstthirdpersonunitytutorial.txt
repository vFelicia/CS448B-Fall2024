00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this video we're going to do
00:03 - something really interesting
00:04 - so a while ago i made a really awesome
00:06 - house building system
00:07 - and then unity made the awesome free
00:09 - standard assets which includes a first
00:11 - person and a third person controller
00:13 - so now here let's put them both together
00:15 - to make the house building system work
00:17 - in third and first person
00:19 - i want to have a character in the world
00:20 - look around me and play some objects
00:22 - this is similar to games like valheim in
00:24 - third person or minecraft and rust in
00:26 - first person
00:27 - after watching this you can download the
00:28 - project files and use them to build up
00:30 - your games
00:30 - okay so let's do it easily build games
00:33 - with this video's sponsor core
00:35 - core is a free game creation platform
00:37 - that lets you build and publish your
00:38 - games
00:39 - it is great for very quickly and very
00:41 - easily prototyping any ideas you have
00:43 - and it is especially easy to build
00:45 - multiplayer games since all of the
00:47 - complicated networking parts are all
00:48 - handled automatically
00:50 - you have thousands of free high quality
00:52 - sound and art assets to build your game
00:54 - you can build entire games without code
00:55 - or if you want to take it further you
00:57 - can write your own custom game logic
00:59 - using lua
01:00 - once you have your game built you just
01:01 - click a button and it's instantly
01:03 - available for anyone to play
01:05 - also right now there's two awesome
01:06 - events running first the core
01:08 - traffic jam create a vehicle game using
01:10 - course tools
01:11 - make some cars boats or go crazy and
01:13 - build something truly original
01:14 - this one has a twenty five thousand
01:16 - dollar prize poll and starts right today
01:18 - and there's also the core invitational
01:20 - game jam with a massive prize pool of a
01:22 - hundred and forty thousand dollars
01:23 - including a brand new tesla model 3
01:25 - applications close in just a few days so
01:27 - click the link right now to download
01:29 - core for free and build something
01:30 - awesome
01:31 - now like i said here we're going to
01:32 - combine things that i covered in two
01:34 - videos
01:35 - the house building system and the third
01:36 - person controller so over here i've got
01:39 - both working really the only tricky
01:40 - thing to combine these is handling how
01:42 - the mouse points to a place in the world
01:44 - since we're no longer on a top-down view
01:46 - but we'll get to that problem in a bit
01:48 - first let's look at how the house
01:49 - building system is working
01:50 - so here is the same thing from that
01:52 - video there's this overhead camera
01:54 - then i can click on these buttons to
01:56 - choose what object type to place
01:58 - and then i can simply move my mouse and
02:00 - click to place them so place down a
02:01 - bunch of floors
02:02 - and then place down a whole bunch of
02:04 - walls and finally a nice door
02:06 - and there you go there's my now's house
02:08 - so that's it this is an awesome system
02:10 - for building houses or really any
02:11 - structure
02:12 - now if you want to know how this system
02:13 - works you watch that video in the home
02:15 - grid system playlist
02:16 - and like i said after watching this
02:17 - video you can download the project file
02:19 - to inspect all the source code for
02:20 - yourself
02:21 - now the first thing we want is to add
02:22 - the third person controller onto this
02:24 - scene
02:24 - so for that i'm going to do it just like
02:26 - i showed on the star assets video so
02:28 - just scroll down over here i've got the
02:29 - star assets and the third person
02:31 - controller
02:31 - so first let's drag the main camera then
02:34 - let me also disable the camera
02:36 - on the house building system so over
02:37 - here my previous main camera as well as
02:39 - the virtual camera
02:40 - okay disable both those so i only got
02:42 - this one all right now add the player
02:44 - follow camera
02:45 - and finally the player armature so here
02:47 - it is yep there's the character
02:49 - and to set it up all i have to do is go
02:51 - into the player phone camera and assign
02:52 - the player root
02:53 - and just like this if i hit play and yep
02:56 - just like that everything is working so
02:57 - i've got my character and i can move it
02:59 - around
02:59 - now this character itself doesn't look
03:01 - very good in this setting so i'm going
03:03 - to use a character from the same asset
03:04 - pack that i used on the house building
03:05 - system
03:06 - there's a link in the description if you
03:07 - want to get it so i'm going to swap out
03:09 - the character just like i covered on the
03:11 - star assets video
03:12 - so just go into the player unpack it
03:14 - then i need to find the character
03:16 - so i just drag the character i get rid
03:17 - of the other two
03:19 - i remove the animator and i attach the
03:21 - avatar here and yep here it is
03:23 - everything working
03:24 - okay great so we have the house building
03:26 - system and the third person character
03:28 - both working in this scene all right so
03:29 - far so good
03:30 - now let's see the code for how the house
03:32 - building system is placing objects
03:34 - it's over here on this function it
03:36 - simply tests for the input get mouse
03:37 - button down so on the left mouse button
03:39 - then it used the mouse 3d class to get
03:41 - the mouse warm position
03:43 - so i cover this in a dedicated video if
03:44 - you want to learn more but really all it
03:46 - does is a raycast
03:47 - right directly from the camera screen
03:49 - point array so in the third person
03:51 - controller the mouse is always stuck in
03:53 - the center of the screen so this exact
03:55 - same logic is going to work without any
03:57 - issues
03:57 - for that let's just quickly add a
03:59 - crosshair so we know where the mouse
04:00 - cursor is
04:01 - so let me go inside the canvas and just
04:04 - create just a simple image
04:06 - for the crosshair and really just select
04:10 - the circle
04:11 - something very tiny and add a nice
04:13 - outline
04:14 - and let's also test to make sure that
04:15 - the mouse over position is correct so
04:17 - let's make a debug visual just to
04:19 - quickly see
04:20 - so just a simple sphere then on the
04:22 - mouse 3d script
04:23 - right here let's add another feel for
04:25 - our debug sphere
04:28 - and really enough they just put this one
04:30 - there alright so here i am and yep it
04:32 - does work so it correctly identifies the
04:34 - mouse position so the mouse is centered
04:35 - on the screen so everything is already
04:36 - working perfectly
04:37 - okay so far so good now let's test
04:40 - spawning a4
04:41 - object for that naturally we need to
04:42 - change the input since the mouse is
04:44 - locked so i can't really go down into
04:46 - those ui buttons
04:47 - so over here is the ui script that
04:49 - handles all those buttons
04:50 - and all the buttons we only do is just
04:52 - trigger this function so let's trigger
04:54 - this using key inputs instead of the
04:55 - mouse
04:56 - so let's make a very simple private void
04:58 - update
04:59 - and on update simply test get key down
05:03 - and let's go with the alpha alpha one
05:05 - through something
05:06 - and just trigger that
05:16 - all right that's it let's test so here i
05:19 - am and as i press keys
05:20 - yep there you go with the enable and i
05:21 - can see the ghost so i can see that one
05:23 - that one that one and that one
05:24 - all right and now if i click there's
05:26 - actually a minor issue the issue is that
05:28 - the click tests if there is nothing
05:29 - blocking it on the ui but right now
05:31 - there's a crosshair right on top so
05:32 - that's an easy fix
05:33 - just go up here into the ui find that
05:35 - image the crosshair and just disable the
05:37 - raycast
05:38 - target that way it won't go through and
05:39 - it will not block anything
05:41 - so now here i am press the button click
05:43 - and there you go now i'm placing down
05:44 - objects just like that
05:52 - and yeah there you go here is a really
05:54 - nice house and now the door already
05:56 - works but actually the
05:57 - standard assets need to change one thing
06:00 - so over here on the player there is a
06:01 - script to actually allow it to push
06:03 - things
06:04 - so just enable this and now if i go
06:07 - and yep there you go i can now push the
06:08 - door and go inside my really nice house
06:10 - all right awesome so just like that we
06:12 - already have the basics working
06:14 - now the one big difference compared to
06:16 - the house building system is how do we
06:17 - handle multiple levels
06:19 - so when i made that system in there i
06:21 - went to the simplest approach of
06:22 - pressing a button to change the active
06:23 - level so right now i'm placing on ground
06:25 - level and as i press a button
06:26 - now it's up there on level one now and
06:28 - level two and so on
06:29 - but here since we are living in the
06:31 - world itself it makes a lot more sense
06:33 - to have that process automated based on
06:34 - where i'm pointing the mouse
06:36 - so how we're going to handle this is
06:37 - based on the mouse we're on position so
06:39 - if the player is looking at the floor
06:40 - the mouse position won't be on zero so
06:42 - it won't place it on level zero
06:43 - but if the player is looking a bit
06:45 - higher then the mouse by position will
06:47 - be higher so we need to do some math to
06:48 - identify the level
06:49 - okay so let's do that by the way if you
06:52 - find the video helpful please hit the
06:53 - like button
06:54 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
06:55 - help thanks so over here we're gearing
06:57 - the mouse one position
06:59 - and then down here we're testing for the
07:01 - get key down and then we're selecting
07:03 - the grid
07:04 - so let's automate this system so let's
07:06 - name this one the handle grid select
07:08 - manual and then have another one for the
07:11 - panel grid select automatic
07:15 - so here instead of the minimum function
07:16 - let's test
07:18 - using the handle grid selection
07:20 - automatic
07:22 - okay now here first let's get the mouse
07:24 - on position
07:29 - and now let's see the height of the
07:30 - walls so here's the house building
07:32 - system and the prefabs
07:34 - and let's go into objects and look up
07:37 - the wall
07:38 - object now just look at this and see
07:40 - just how tall this one is
07:41 - so here it is and as i move it up okay
07:43 - it's about 2.5 units okay
07:45 - so up here let's just take the mouse
07:47 - position dot y
07:48 - and divide it by 2.5 units so this is
07:52 - the grid height
07:55 - and actually this one should also be
07:57 - defined up here so let's see
07:59 - yep over here for the grid vertical size
08:01 - i'm already defining this so let's use
08:02 - this as a constant so we use it in the
08:04 - same place
08:07 - so we're in height then over here we use
08:10 - this one
08:11 - and then down here on the other function
08:12 - use the same value okay so now we can
08:15 - just do a math.round to round this value
08:18 - and then this will be the grid index so
08:21 - we go into the selected
08:24 - grid
08:26 - and we just select the one on this index
08:28 - so
08:29 - just with this very simple logic
08:30 - everything should already be working so
08:31 - let's test
08:32 - okay so here i am aiming at the floor
08:34 - and place it on the ground level all
08:36 - right now let's just place on a wall
08:38 - and as i move up yep there you go it
08:39 - automatically goes so as i go towards
08:41 - the midpoint of the wall it changes from
08:43 - the grid down there to the grid up there
08:45 - all right so just like this already
08:47 - working great so i can place it in there
08:49 - and there you go now i've got one down
08:50 - here and one up there
08:51 - and with this setup is made by using a
08:54 - raycast so it really works on anything
08:56 - that has a call either
08:57 - meaning over there i've got a nice
08:59 - mountain so as i go towards this
09:00 - mountain
09:01 - as i hit it yep there you go it
09:02 - automatically goes up there
09:04 - so yep look at that really nice so with
09:07 - that yep we already have multiple levels
09:09 - working
09:10 - now there's a few issues that we need to
09:11 - take care of the first issue is the
09:13 - distance so right now there's no limit
09:14 - so i can place an object
09:16 - all the way over there very far away
09:18 - that's obviously not intentional
09:20 - so let's add a simple check to that here
09:23 - when we're handling normal object
09:24 - placement
09:25 - we get the mouse position and now let's
09:27 - do a simple distance check from the
09:29 - player
09:29 - so here i need to add a reference for
09:31 - the player itself
09:36 - okay and then down here you get the most
09:39 - position then just do
09:40 - a vector three dot distance testing the
09:43 - player position and the mouse position
09:47 - and the final float for the max build
09:49 - distance
09:50 - let's put it at something and just test
09:52 - and we only do this if it's under that
09:54 - distance
09:56 - okay very simple let's test so here if i
09:59 - point on the ground and click if there
10:00 - goes place now i point very far away and
10:02 - i click
10:03 - and nope it did not spawn anything
10:05 - alright great
10:06 - now for the other issue which is the
10:08 - mouse position is based on collision
10:10 - so in the house building system that was
10:12 - an issue because the camera was always
10:13 - pointing down so it will always collide
10:15 - with something
10:16 - but here we are in third person which
10:17 - means we can look up onto the sky
10:19 - and since the sky has no collateral if
10:21 - there's no collision then the position
10:23 - simply defaults into zero zero so if i
10:25 - look up at the sky then goes all the way
10:26 - in there so if i click on the sky i'm
10:28 - placing an object in there
10:29 - that's not intentional so let's fix that
10:31 - there are two ways we can do it
10:33 - the first is simply testing to see if it
10:35 - collides with something
10:36 - and if there is no collision then we
10:37 - simply don't allow it to build or the
10:39 - simplest solution which is we can simply
10:41 - add invisible
10:42 - letters all around the world so to make
10:44 - sure that it always collides with
10:45 - something
10:46 - so let's go with that simpler approach
10:47 - just over here on the hierarchy create a
10:49 - new cube
10:50 - and just stretch it out and put it on
10:52 - the edges of the world
10:56 - okay just like that one in that corner
10:59 - another one that corner
11:00 - then rotate and put it on the other
11:02 - corner
11:05 - and finally the one up top
11:10 - okay so now the world is completely
11:11 - inside of these colliders now obviously
11:13 - this is not meant to be visible so just
11:15 - hide the mesh render and leave the
11:16 - collector enabled
11:17 - so just do that and now we have
11:19 - collaterals with no visuals and if we
11:21 - play
11:22 - okay so here i am looking at zero zero
11:24 - and now if i point the miles upward
11:26 - if there you go now the ghost stays in
11:27 - there and i cannot place it since it's
11:29 - too far
11:30 - all right yep great now the other issue
11:33 - is that
11:33 - placement can be a little bit fiddly
11:35 - when aiming at walls
11:36 - so let me place on some basic huts
11:41 - so i've placed these walls and now i
11:43 - want to place another far object right
11:44 - up there
11:45 - but due to how the grid position works
11:48 - it's based on
11:49 - actually pointing to the lower left
11:51 - corner so if i point over here you can
11:53 - see the wall
11:55 - the floor object is actually two by two
11:56 - so i cannot actually place it perfectly
11:58 - since if
11:59 - i move away then now it's no longer
12:00 - colliding so it doesn't work
12:02 - again since this is all working with
12:03 - colliders i can just put some invisible
12:05 - collaterals over here on the edges of
12:07 - the walls
12:08 - so into the objects let's go into the
12:10 - wall object
12:11 - and let's just make a cube and then just
12:13 - stretch it out
12:18 - okay so just like this this has a box
12:20 - ladder so let's hide the visual
12:21 - now it will still block the mouse and
12:24 - just make sure we don't make some
12:25 - invisible platforms just make this a
12:26 - trigger
12:27 - okay and now if i place down some four
12:29 - objects and place
12:30 - out a wall and i want to place a4 object
12:32 - on the second floor so if i aim upwards
12:34 - there you go that one is not correct
12:36 - so it's in there but as i move a bit up
12:38 - yep there you go now i can click in
12:40 - there place in there and everything
12:41 - works perfect
12:42 - and there you go i've got a really nice
12:44 - shoulder all right so with this now all
12:46 - that's left is really just to make this
12:47 - work in first person
12:49 - so it's really the same thing we just
12:50 - need to swap out the character
12:51 - controller
12:52 - so let me just duplicate the scene and
12:54 - make the other one in
12:55 - first person okay so here i've got the
12:58 - first person controller
13:00 - so same thing let's first get rid of
13:02 - these ones then drag the main camera
13:04 - the player file camera and the caption
13:06 - and just set the player camera root
13:08 - and just with this it should already be
13:10 - working all right so here i am walking
13:12 - around the first person
13:13 - now just use the buttons and place down
13:15 - a four object another one
13:16 - and so on place down a bunch of walls
13:22 - and nice door and now i can go in and
13:25 - there you go i'm inside my nice hut
13:27 - and now let's place things on the second
13:28 - level so fortune some stairs
13:31 - okay so now i can go up and place down
13:33 - things over here on the second level
13:35 - and maybe make another level
13:46 - alright so here i am i go to the third
13:48 - level and i'll look out the window
13:49 - so here you can see a really great
13:51 - example of just how useful these starter
13:52 - assets are
13:53 - so in 10 seconds you can easily get your
13:55 - characters working in third or first
13:56 - person
13:57 - so with all that here is the final
13:59 - system i've got my character and living
14:00 - around the world everything looks really
14:02 - nice
14:03 - now i can select what object type i want
14:04 - to place i can place down a bunch of
14:06 - four objects
14:09 - then i can place down some walls
14:13 - i can put up some stairs then place on
14:16 - floors on the second level
14:18 - and finally place down a nice door and
14:21 - there you go here's my nice hunt
14:23 - so i can go inside and yeah here it
14:25 - looks all very good i can go up to the
14:27 - second floor
14:28 - look out the windows and yep here i've
14:30 - got a really nice cozy hut
14:32 - as you can see this is a great building
14:33 - system very much like something you see
14:35 - in valheim
14:36 - and when using the first person
14:37 - controller it's just like something like
14:39 - minecraft or rust
14:40 - now you can go ahead and download the
14:41 - project files and build something on top
14:43 - of this
14:44 - also don't forget to check out core and
14:45 - the two events currently running
14:47 - make an awesome vehicle game for the
14:48 - core traffic jam and participate in the
14:51 - core invitational game jam for a chance
14:52 - to win from a 140 000

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey in this video we're going to do something really interesting so a while ago i made a really awesome house building system and then unity made the awesome free standard assets which includes a first person and a third person controller so now here let's put them both together to make the house building system work in third and first person i want to have a character in the world look around me and play some objects this is similar to games like valheim in third person or minecraft and rust in first person after watching this you can download the project files and use them to build up your games okay so let's do it easily build games with this video's sponsor core core is a free game creation platform that lets you build and publish your games it is great for very quickly and very easily prototyping any ideas you have and it is especially easy to build multiplayer games since all of the complicated networking parts are all handled automatically you have thousands of free high quality sound and art assets to build your game you can build entire games without code or if you want to take it further you can write your own custom game logic using lua once you have your game built you just click a button and it's instantly available for anyone to play also right now there's two awesome events running first the core traffic jam create a vehicle game using course tools make some cars boats or go crazy and build something truly original this one has a twenty five thousand dollar prize poll and starts right today and there's also the core invitational game jam with a massive prize pool of a hundred and forty thousand dollars including a brand new tesla model 3 applications close in just a few days so click the link right now to download core for free and build something awesome now like i said here we're going to combine things that i covered in two videos the house building system and the third person controller so over here i've got both working really the only tricky thing to combine these is handling how the mouse points to a place in the world since we're no longer on a topdown view but we'll get to that problem in a bit first let's look at how the house building system is working so here is the same thing from that video there's this overhead camera then i can click on these buttons to choose what object type to place and then i can simply move my mouse and click to place them so place down a bunch of floors and then place down a whole bunch of walls and finally a nice door and there you go there's my now's house so that's it this is an awesome system for building houses or really any structure now if you want to know how this system works you watch that video in the home grid system playlist and like i said after watching this video you can download the project file to inspect all the source code for yourself now the first thing we want is to add the third person controller onto this scene so for that i'm going to do it just like i showed on the star assets video so just scroll down over here i've got the star assets and the third person controller so first let's drag the main camera then let me also disable the camera on the house building system so over here my previous main camera as well as the virtual camera okay disable both those so i only got this one all right now add the player follow camera and finally the player armature so here it is yep there's the character and to set it up all i have to do is go into the player phone camera and assign the player root and just like this if i hit play and yep just like that everything is working so i've got my character and i can move it around now this character itself doesn't look very good in this setting so i'm going to use a character from the same asset pack that i used on the house building system there's a link in the description if you want to get it so i'm going to swap out the character just like i covered on the star assets video so just go into the player unpack it then i need to find the character so i just drag the character i get rid of the other two i remove the animator and i attach the avatar here and yep here it is everything working okay great so we have the house building system and the third person character both working in this scene all right so far so good now let's see the code for how the house building system is placing objects it's over here on this function it simply tests for the input get mouse button down so on the left mouse button then it used the mouse 3d class to get the mouse warm position so i cover this in a dedicated video if you want to learn more but really all it does is a raycast right directly from the camera screen point array so in the third person controller the mouse is always stuck in the center of the screen so this exact same logic is going to work without any issues for that let's just quickly add a crosshair so we know where the mouse cursor is so let me go inside the canvas and just create just a simple image for the crosshair and really just select the circle something very tiny and add a nice outline and let's also test to make sure that the mouse over position is correct so let's make a debug visual just to quickly see so just a simple sphere then on the mouse 3d script right here let's add another feel for our debug sphere and really enough they just put this one there alright so here i am and yep it does work so it correctly identifies the mouse position so the mouse is centered on the screen so everything is already working perfectly okay so far so good now let's test spawning a4 object for that naturally we need to change the input since the mouse is locked so i can't really go down into those ui buttons so over here is the ui script that handles all those buttons and all the buttons we only do is just trigger this function so let's trigger this using key inputs instead of the mouse so let's make a very simple private void update and on update simply test get key down and let's go with the alpha alpha one through something and just trigger that all right that's it let's test so here i am and as i press keys yep there you go with the enable and i can see the ghost so i can see that one that one that one and that one all right and now if i click there's actually a minor issue the issue is that the click tests if there is nothing blocking it on the ui but right now there's a crosshair right on top so that's an easy fix just go up here into the ui find that image the crosshair and just disable the raycast target that way it won't go through and it will not block anything so now here i am press the button click and there you go now i'm placing down objects just like that and yeah there you go here is a really nice house and now the door already works but actually the standard assets need to change one thing so over here on the player there is a script to actually allow it to push things so just enable this and now if i go and yep there you go i can now push the door and go inside my really nice house all right awesome so just like that we already have the basics working now the one big difference compared to the house building system is how do we handle multiple levels so when i made that system in there i went to the simplest approach of pressing a button to change the active level so right now i'm placing on ground level and as i press a button now it's up there on level one now and level two and so on but here since we are living in the world itself it makes a lot more sense to have that process automated based on where i'm pointing the mouse so how we're going to handle this is based on the mouse we're on position so if the player is looking at the floor the mouse position won't be on zero so it won't place it on level zero but if the player is looking a bit higher then the mouse by position will be higher so we need to do some math to identify the level okay so let's do that by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks so over here we're gearing the mouse one position and then down here we're testing for the get key down and then we're selecting the grid so let's automate this system so let's name this one the handle grid select manual and then have another one for the panel grid select automatic so here instead of the minimum function let's test using the handle grid selection automatic okay now here first let's get the mouse on position and now let's see the height of the walls so here's the house building system and the prefabs and let's go into objects and look up the wall object now just look at this and see just how tall this one is so here it is and as i move it up okay it's about 2.5 units okay so up here let's just take the mouse position dot y and divide it by 2.5 units so this is the grid height and actually this one should also be defined up here so let's see yep over here for the grid vertical size i'm already defining this so let's use this as a constant so we use it in the same place so we're in height then over here we use this one and then down here on the other function use the same value okay so now we can just do a math.round to round this value and then this will be the grid index so we go into the selected grid and we just select the one on this index so just with this very simple logic everything should already be working so let's test okay so here i am aiming at the floor and place it on the ground level all right now let's just place on a wall and as i move up yep there you go it automatically goes so as i go towards the midpoint of the wall it changes from the grid down there to the grid up there all right so just like this already working great so i can place it in there and there you go now i've got one down here and one up there and with this setup is made by using a raycast so it really works on anything that has a call either meaning over there i've got a nice mountain so as i go towards this mountain as i hit it yep there you go it automatically goes up there so yep look at that really nice so with that yep we already have multiple levels working now there's a few issues that we need to take care of the first issue is the distance so right now there's no limit so i can place an object all the way over there very far away that's obviously not intentional so let's add a simple check to that here when we're handling normal object placement we get the mouse position and now let's do a simple distance check from the player so here i need to add a reference for the player itself okay and then down here you get the most position then just do a vector three dot distance testing the player position and the mouse position and the final float for the max build distance let's put it at something and just test and we only do this if it's under that distance okay very simple let's test so here if i point on the ground and click if there goes place now i point very far away and i click and nope it did not spawn anything alright great now for the other issue which is the mouse position is based on collision so in the house building system that was an issue because the camera was always pointing down so it will always collide with something but here we are in third person which means we can look up onto the sky and since the sky has no collateral if there's no collision then the position simply defaults into zero zero so if i look up at the sky then goes all the way in there so if i click on the sky i'm placing an object in there that's not intentional so let's fix that there are two ways we can do it the first is simply testing to see if it collides with something and if there is no collision then we simply don't allow it to build or the simplest solution which is we can simply add invisible letters all around the world so to make sure that it always collides with something so let's go with that simpler approach just over here on the hierarchy create a new cube and just stretch it out and put it on the edges of the world okay just like that one in that corner another one that corner then rotate and put it on the other corner and finally the one up top okay so now the world is completely inside of these colliders now obviously this is not meant to be visible so just hide the mesh render and leave the collector enabled so just do that and now we have collaterals with no visuals and if we play okay so here i am looking at zero zero and now if i point the miles upward if there you go now the ghost stays in there and i cannot place it since it's too far all right yep great now the other issue is that placement can be a little bit fiddly when aiming at walls so let me place on some basic huts so i've placed these walls and now i want to place another far object right up there but due to how the grid position works it's based on actually pointing to the lower left corner so if i point over here you can see the wall the floor object is actually two by two so i cannot actually place it perfectly since if i move away then now it's no longer colliding so it doesn't work again since this is all working with colliders i can just put some invisible collaterals over here on the edges of the walls so into the objects let's go into the wall object and let's just make a cube and then just stretch it out okay so just like this this has a box ladder so let's hide the visual now it will still block the mouse and just make sure we don't make some invisible platforms just make this a trigger okay and now if i place down some four objects and place out a wall and i want to place a4 object on the second floor so if i aim upwards there you go that one is not correct so it's in there but as i move a bit up yep there you go now i can click in there place in there and everything works perfect and there you go i've got a really nice shoulder all right so with this now all that's left is really just to make this work in first person so it's really the same thing we just need to swap out the character controller so let me just duplicate the scene and make the other one in first person okay so here i've got the first person controller so same thing let's first get rid of these ones then drag the main camera the player file camera and the caption and just set the player camera root and just with this it should already be working all right so here i am walking around the first person now just use the buttons and place down a four object another one and so on place down a bunch of walls and nice door and now i can go in and there you go i'm inside my nice hut and now let's place things on the second level so fortune some stairs okay so now i can go up and place down things over here on the second level and maybe make another level alright so here i am i go to the third level and i'll look out the window so here you can see a really great example of just how useful these starter assets are so in 10 seconds you can easily get your characters working in third or first person so with all that here is the final system i've got my character and living around the world everything looks really nice now i can select what object type i want to place i can place down a bunch of four objects then i can place down some walls i can put up some stairs then place on floors on the second level and finally place down a nice door and there you go here's my nice hunt so i can go inside and yeah here it looks all very good i can go up to the second floor look out the windows and yep here i've got a really nice cozy hut as you can see this is a great building system very much like something you see in valheim and when using the first person controller it's just like something like minecraft or rust now you can go ahead and download the project files and build something on top of this also don't forget to check
