00:00 - hey everyone later today starts off the
00:02 - mixing game jam organized by andre from
00:04 - the channel mixing jam
00:05 - i haven't participated in a game jam in
00:07 - quite a while my last one was the one
00:09 - where i made the legend of slaser game
00:11 - that was over one year ago gems are
00:13 - always an interesting event but i never
00:15 - really have the time
00:16 - but now since i've just finished my last
00:17 - week project making the course now is
00:19 - the perfect time to do something quick
00:21 - like a quick and fun game jam
00:22 - it starts off today and the theme won't
00:24 - be announced in a few hours it's a
00:26 - standard 48 hour jam so you have the
00:28 - whole weekend to get something
00:29 - interesting done
00:30 - remember that game jams are all about
00:32 - making a game in a very tight schedule
00:34 - so keeping your scope nice and tight is
00:36 - extremely important
00:37 - as always remember that everyone has a
00:39 - tendency of over scoping so if you
00:40 - participate when you come up with an
00:42 - idea cut it in half it's better to have
00:44 - something small in finished than
00:46 - something super large and unfinished
00:48 - the main rule is that all of the code
00:50 - must be written during the game jam
00:51 - so that kind of goes against what i
00:53 - usually say about reusing as much code
00:54 - as possible
00:55 - but it will be an interesting challenge
00:57 - to see how much code i can write from
00:58 - scratch in such a short period of time
01:01 - although you can also use pre-made
01:03 - assets so i might look into all the
01:04 - packages that i've bought from the asset
01:06 - store recently
01:07 - i've got tons of assets that i picked up
01:08 - in various sales and bundles so i might
01:10 - find some use for some of them
01:12 - also tomorrow i'm planning to do a quick
01:14 - live stream as i work on the game
01:16 - it will be a good first test to try out
01:18 - how live streaming works so i can then
01:19 - do some more live streams
01:21 - this will be my very first one so it's
01:23 - very much just an experiment
01:24 - no idea whether it won't go very well or
01:26 - disaster so don't expect too much but if
01:29 - you have the time come ahead and say hi
01:31 - alright so go ahead sign up for the game
01:33 - jam on itch set a reminder for the theme
01:35 - video and i'll see you tomorrow
