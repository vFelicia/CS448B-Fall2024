00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - here's a super quick video just in case
00:04 - some of you are concerned recently Unity
00:06 - had some layoffs which always sucks over
00:08 - 600 people were let go or about eight
00:10 - percent of their Workforce in response
00:12 - to that some people were questioning
00:14 - what this means for various things in
00:15 - development I tried to ask Unity which
00:17 - specific teams were affected but out of
00:19 - respect for those people and they kept
00:20 - that information private and some big
00:22 - news is Mike hecton who was a very
00:24 - important person on the tech side was
00:26 - apparently either included in the
00:27 - layoffs or at least left around the same
00:29 - time for those of you who don't know
00:30 - Mike was one of the big data oriented
00:33 - guys that was brought in several years
00:34 - ago to really posit dots so with them
00:37 - suddenly leaving people were concerned
00:39 - what this means for Dots is there some
00:40 - trouble on that team or are things still
00:42 - going according to plan and I'm guessing
00:44 - in response to those concerns the dots
00:46 - team made a real nice threat in the
00:47 - forums talking about the current set of
00:49 - dots and just having tons of people that
00:51 - are working on the team introduce
00:52 - themselves it's fun to see the
00:54 - background of all these people it's also
00:55 - varied everything from Indie or Tripoli
00:57 - console devs there's even some microchip
00:59 - engineers and astrophysicists basically
01:01 - lots of people working on lot so it's
01:03 - still very much in development it's a
01:04 - real nice thread many comments from both
01:06 - unity and other developers some
01:08 - questions and a bunch of answers up top
01:09 - here is Lauren who is the main product
01:11 - manager in charge of dots then here is
01:13 - Joe which is the director on dots and
01:16 - here is a post related to Mike Laura
01:18 - here says that Mike moved on to other
01:19 - projects about 10 months ago so Joe has
01:21 - been leading the dots engineering effort
01:23 - since then so it appears the layoffs
01:25 - might not have affected the dots team
01:26 - for some specific questions here is one
01:28 - on the dots animation package this one
01:31 - has apparently been the works for quite
01:32 - a while and is hopefully approaching
01:33 - completion this is a pretty big thing so
01:35 - it's rare to see this going to be the
01:36 - next major deliverable I believe this
01:38 - means after 1.0 then a question
01:40 - regarding project tiny this was a fun
01:42 - project which was a way to take
01:43 - advantage of a data oriented design to
01:46 - make super tiny games like literally
01:47 - just kilobytes that project is
01:49 - apparently on pause until the DOT score
01:51 - is done and more things are added on top
01:52 - of it another question on dots visual
01:54 - scripting this was a tool that existed
01:56 - for quite a while way back in the
01:58 - beginning but since then it was paused
01:59 - or stopped the answer is pretty much the
02:01 - same thing so the focus on the same
02:02 - analyzing the ECS Foundation before
02:04 - moving on to more things another
02:05 - question with regards to webgl and dots
02:07 - apparently right now there are some
02:09 - issues with those which are currently
02:10 - being worked on and in terms of timeline
02:12 - here is the first post panel run he says
02:14 - the plan is still to launch dots 1.0 the
02:16 - final version of ECS with netcodes
02:18 - graphics and physics and the plan is to
02:20 - launch that alongside 22 LTS usually the
02:22 - LTS version comes out around April or
02:24 - May so I'm guessing it's really close
02:25 - and I'm assuming that version will
02:27 - indeed have a big dots 1.0 Banner
02:29 - personally I haven't looked into it
02:31 - myself since I made my big tutorial
02:33 - after the 1.0 preview so I'm definitely
02:35 - looking forward to doing some research
02:36 - and seeing how much of that tutorial is
02:38 - still up to date when the final 1.0 is
02:40 - out another excellent post on this red
02:41 - is this one by Andrew Parsons who is the
02:43 - marketing side of dots in ECS here are a
02:46 - ton of resources all about dots and
02:48 - these first two are really great one of
02:50 - them is on the game heroish and the
02:52 - other one on V Rising now what's great
02:54 - about DCU is these are examples of real
02:56 - games using dots on Reddit production
02:58 - meaning that even though 1.0 isn't fully
03:00 - out yet it's already stable enough to
03:02 - work with and ship for a complete Dance
03:04 - Project here is a nice QR tutorial made
03:06 - by turbomix games he also made another
03:08 - video recently talking about what has
03:10 - changed since this video then the GDC
03:12 - roadmap tone quarterly talk a bit more
03:14 - about the main plan for dots and how the
03:16 - goal is to get the core stable and
03:17 - release and then afterwards build upon
03:19 - it next here is one that I've been
03:21 - meaning to look at it's a free course I
03:23 - need to learn with dots best practices I
03:25 - definitely want to make sure that I go
03:27 - through this one before I make my nice
03:28 - tutorial then if you have Discord
03:30 - multiplayer Discord the forums and the
03:32 - web pages so even though dots isn't out
03:34 - yet there's already tons of info around
03:36 - so go ahead and check out this red if
03:37 - you're curious to see the people working
03:39 - behind dots if you have any specific
03:41 - questions you can post them in this
03:42 - rather than get answers from the team
03:43 - themselves from my part I'm looking
03:45 - forward to that's 1.0 and I can't wait
03:47 - to see all of the unique games that this
03:48 - technology will enable so this was just
03:50 - a quick video to let you know about this
03:52 - nice thread and that dots is still on
03:53 - track also stay tuned for tomorrow's
03:55 - video which is going to be super
03:57 - interesting and I'm gonna stop working
03:58 - for a bit and go play a bit of Zelda
04:00 - alright thanks for watching and I'll see
04:02 - you next time
