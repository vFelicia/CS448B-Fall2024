00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - so last month one really interesting
00:04 - game came out it's called battle bit
00:05 - remastered this is an indie game that
00:07 - was actually made by a team of just
00:09 - three people over many years and right
00:11 - now it's one of the biggest hits of the
00:13 - Year big not just in terms of indie
00:15 - games but big in just games in general
00:16 - it has already sold over 3 million
00:19 - copies that's an insane amount
00:20 - especially for a three-person team and
00:22 - the story for this game actually is
00:24 - quite interesting first of all it seems
00:26 - like it came out of nowhere at least for
00:27 - me personally I hadn't heard about this
00:29 - game at all I'm someone who follows the
00:31 - video game industry pretty closely and
00:33 - yet I had no idea about this game I've
00:34 - never heard this name so to me this
00:36 - looked like an overnight success but
00:38 - usually any stories about overnight
00:40 - success are usually myth it's usually
00:42 - never really an overnight success if you
00:44 - really look into it there is an
00:45 - excellent GDC tunnelcon exactly that
00:47 - topic it's on the game anti-chamber and
00:49 - it's settled an overnight success seven
00:51 - years in the making basically how this
00:53 - game anti-chamber this was indeed a huge
00:55 - hit as soon as it came out its own
00:56 - millions of copies however it definitely
00:58 - did not came out of nowhere you use
01:00 - being developed and Gathering feedback
01:01 - for over seven years attending all kinds
01:03 - of conventions and things so I highly
01:05 - recommend you watch this GDC talk it's
01:06 - really interesting and for this game for
01:08 - battle build it seems like this one is
01:10 - actually a similar story like I said
01:12 - it's just a three-person team so really
01:13 - small and they've been working on this
01:15 - game for over seven years one of the
01:17 - developers started off by making mods
01:19 - for unturned over eight years ago and
01:21 - the other developer also at that time
01:23 - eight years ago was playing around
01:24 - inside Unity dealing with all kinds of
01:26 - shooting mechanics so this has been
01:28 - worked on for quite a long time the
01:30 - development of this specific game the
01:32 - specific iteration the sexually started
01:33 - in 2017 that's when they opened the
01:35 - actual official Discord for quite a long
01:37 - time they were actually being supported
01:39 - on patreon they were developing the game
01:41 - alongside a small community this is
01:43 - definitely an interesting way to make
01:44 - games it's really difficult it's really
01:46 - difficult to find an audience to support
01:48 - you on patreon as you do game
01:49 - development but it is technically an
01:51 - option if you have something really
01:52 - special and you manage to find a really
01:53 - dedicated community and over here it
01:55 - seems like that's exactly what they've
01:57 - got with that they essentially just grew
01:59 - their Community a bit by bit year by
02:01 - year month by month to put into
02:02 - perspective just how long this game has
02:04 - been development they actually have a
02:05 - green light trailer which was published
02:07 - six years ago green light that's the
02:09 - thing that existed before seem direct I
02:11 - went through green light myself a few
02:12 - times many many years ago so yeah this
02:14 - one has definitely been in development
02:15 - for a very long time at some point they
02:17 - finally put the game on scene and we can
02:19 - actually go into cmdb and check however
02:22 - seem to be actually only goes back all
02:24 - the way back to 2019 but still at this
02:26 - point in 2019 they already had 7 000
02:28 - followers now the general rule is that
02:30 - wishing lists are about 10 times smaller
02:32 - so back in 2019 they already had about
02:34 - 70 000 wishlists now that is a massive
02:36 - amount I'm actually currently working on
02:38 - my upcoming steam game think Guardians
02:40 - and I'm currently at about 2700
02:42 - wishlists and hoping to get to 5000
02:44 - before release so having 70 000 wish
02:46 - list this is a massive amount for any
02:48 - indie game so here on this graph you can
02:50 - see how they grew very slowly but very
02:52 - consistently over time over many many
02:54 - years to the point where when they did a
02:56 - play test all the way back in March of
02:58 - 22 back then they already had 700 000
03:00 - playtesters so even though to me it
03:03 - seemed like this game came out of
03:04 - nowhere it definitely did not we can see
03:06 - in the graph how the game really started
03:07 - to gain Traction in 22 and really blow
03:10 - up like crazy by the time they launched
03:12 - they had 70 000 followers which really
03:14 - means 700 000 wish lists again that is a
03:17 - massive amount I think that probably
03:18 - puts you on the top 10 most wishlist
03:20 - games of all time so with all that by
03:22 - the time that the game launched the game
03:23 - was a huge hit there were tons there
03:25 - were hundreds of thousands or millions
03:27 - of people waiting to pick up the game so
03:28 - as soon as it came out even though it's
03:30 - actually only still in Early Access even
03:32 - with that just by now in about one month
03:34 - they've already got 58 000 reviews so by
03:37 - now they have sold about 3 million
03:38 - copies which is a massive amount and
03:40 - actually for a fun fact there's actually
03:42 - a downside to selling that many copies
03:43 - when it comes to making a multiplayer
03:44 - game which is of course you have to pay
03:46 - for Server costs and servers can
03:47 - actually be quite expensive the
03:49 - developers actually recently did an AMA
03:51 - and they pointed out how they actually
03:52 - had to get a loan in order to keep
03:54 - paying for the server cost because once
03:56 - they did sell a ton of copies over here
03:57 - on Sim in case you don't know seem only
03:59 - pays you on a necessary basis meaning
04:01 - you wait for the month to end in order
04:03 - for Sim to calculate the final total and
04:05 - three days after that they actually send
04:06 - you the money so that means that even
04:08 - though they have sold millions of copies
04:10 - and they have millions and millions of
04:12 - dollars coming their way they're
04:13 - actually only going to receive them by
04:14 - August so they had to get online in the
04:16 - meantime so that's kind of funny the
04:18 - game has a price point of 15 we can do
04:21 - some quick math and say the game has
04:22 - sold three million copies however the
04:24 - devs were also very generous in terms of
04:26 - regional pricing they wanted to make
04:28 - sure that everyone could experience the
04:29 - game even though in low-income countries
04:31 - so instead of the average being about 15
04:33 - let's say it's only about 12 so that
04:35 - means around 36 million dollars now this
04:37 - is obviously the gross amount this is
04:39 - not net I've covered in a previous video
04:41 - the rough math for how to get the net
04:43 - from the gross that is going to depend
04:44 - on what country developers are from and
04:46 - what is the tax rate for their income
04:48 - but in general it's usually about 50
04:50 - percent however in this case like I said
04:52 - they actually got some serious server
04:53 - costs on a game of this scale those
04:55 - server costs are definitely going to be
04:56 - massive so perhaps the net result is
04:58 - maybe just about 10 million dollars
05:00 - which again for a three person team that
05:02 - is a huge amount even taking into
05:03 - account the seven years of development
05:05 - so this is without a doubt a huge make
05:07 - get any hit playing the game myself I
05:09 - can definitely see the appeal it really
05:11 - is like a hyper polished Battlefield
05:13 - game and it's also refreshing to have a
05:15 - game just like this where you just pay
05:16 - once and that's it so on the progression
05:18 - it's all based on kills and action
05:20 - leveling up there are no micro
05:21 - transactions nothing like that so it
05:23 - definitely helps the game stand out from
05:25 - the other releases that have
05:26 - disappointed people the gameplay is
05:27 - really solid it has all of the class
05:29 - that you expect it also has very robust
05:31 - voice tool excellent netcode and
05:33 - anti-cheat protection so it is an
05:35 - extremely well made game that definitely
05:37 - targets its audience perfectly and
05:39 - funnily enough it also has the unity
05:40 - free splash screen logo usually people
05:43 - associate the smash screen with low
05:44 - quality games so I wonder if this game
05:46 - will actually help unity's reputation
05:48 - within mind of Gamers to answer the
05:50 - question in the title so how did this
05:51 - game actually end up selling 3 million
05:53 - copies well the first part of that
05:54 - answer is an obvious one which is they
05:56 - had a great game in order to find this
05:58 - level of success you really need a great
06:00 - game coupled with great marketing and
06:01 - they definitely did both those perfectly
06:03 - they built a game where they focus on
06:05 - the gameplay they focus on making sure
06:06 - the game actually plays where right and
06:08 - it's actually something that a lot of
06:09 - people have been waiting for the latest
06:11 - battlefield was a very disappointing
06:12 - release from a lot of people so
06:14 - something like this with excellent
06:15 - gameplay that really brings back to the
06:17 - battlefield routes there was definitely
06:18 - a huge audience waiting for exactly a
06:20 - game just like this with a huge focus on
06:22 - excellent gameplay
06:23 - so they had an excellent game and there
06:25 - was a huge audience that really won that
06:27 - game then of course they actually
06:28 - gathered that audience over a long
06:29 - period of time like we saw they've been
06:31 - developing this game alongside a
06:33 - community for over seven years and even
06:35 - on Steam they've been slowly Gathering
06:37 - wishlists and followers for many many
06:39 - years again the importance of wishlist
06:41 - cannot be under Satan nowadays it is an
06:43 - extremely important thing Gathering all
06:45 - of those wish lists really ensure that
06:46 - they would get a massively successful
06:48 - launch which again when coupled with an
06:50 - excellent game that's how it really
06:52 - blows up and and of course as with
06:54 - anything luck is always somewhat of a
06:55 - factor I've made a video dedicated on
06:57 - that topic there are some people who
06:59 - will look at this game and say they just
07:00 - got lucky they were on the right place
07:01 - at right time and some of that is partly
07:03 - true but more importantly is really all
07:06 - the effort that they put in for over
07:07 - seven years developing this game
07:09 - Gathering that Audience by doing all
07:11 - that work they made sure to essentially
07:13 - eliminate as much luck as possible
07:15 - thanks to Gathering those 700 000
07:16 - wishlists they ensured that the game was
07:18 - going to be successful no matter what so
07:20 - like I said in that unlock video like
07:22 - it's always a factor but as developer
07:23 - you do have quite a bit of control over
07:25 - it when you put all those together
07:26 - that's how this game found massive
07:28 - success now of course my advice to you
07:30 - is don't try to aim for something like
07:31 - this this is a mega huge Indie hit if
07:34 - you're just trying to be a successful
07:35 - Indie Games developer you don't need to
07:37 - sell millions of copies so it's always
07:38 - great to look at stores like this one in
07:40 - order to inspire you and remember how it
07:42 - is possible to find Monumental success
07:43 - but still you don't need something on
07:45 - this scale so with your own games
07:47 - definitely try to make a great game
07:48 - definitely make sure you focus on
07:50 - marketing and Gathering some kind of
07:51 - community that desperately wants to play
07:53 - your game do all of that and hopefully
07:55 - you won't find quite a bit of success
07:56 - alright so that's the story of battle
07:58 - metering mastered one of the biggest
07:59 - Indie hits of not just this year but
08:01 - many many years it seemingly came out of
08:04 - nowhere but in reality was being
08:05 - developed for over seven years so
08:07 - congrats to the developers on making an
08:09 - excellent game and finding huge success
08:10 - thank you for watching and I'll see you
08:12 - next time
08:24 - thank you
08:26 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so last month one really interesting game came out it's called battle bit remastered this is an indie game that was actually made by a team of just three people over many years and right now it's one of the biggest hits of the Year big not just in terms of indie games but big in just games in general it has already sold over 3 million copies that's an insane amount especially for a threeperson team and the story for this game actually is quite interesting first of all it seems like it came out of nowhere at least for me personally I hadn't heard about this game at all I'm someone who follows the video game industry pretty closely and yet I had no idea about this game I've never heard this name so to me this looked like an overnight success but usually any stories about overnight success are usually myth it's usually never really an overnight success if you really look into it there is an excellent GDC tunnelcon exactly that topic it's on the game antichamber and it's settled an overnight success seven years in the making basically how this game antichamber this was indeed a huge hit as soon as it came out its own millions of copies however it definitely did not came out of nowhere you use being developed and Gathering feedback for over seven years attending all kinds of conventions and things so I highly recommend you watch this GDC talk it's really interesting and for this game for battle build it seems like this one is actually a similar story like I said it's just a threeperson team so really small and they've been working on this game for over seven years one of the developers started off by making mods for unturned over eight years ago and the other developer also at that time eight years ago was playing around inside Unity dealing with all kinds of shooting mechanics so this has been worked on for quite a long time the development of this specific game the specific iteration the sexually started in 2017 that's when they opened the actual official Discord for quite a long time they were actually being supported on patreon they were developing the game alongside a small community this is definitely an interesting way to make games it's really difficult it's really difficult to find an audience to support you on patreon as you do game development but it is technically an option if you have something really special and you manage to find a really dedicated community and over here it seems like that's exactly what they've got with that they essentially just grew their Community a bit by bit year by year month by month to put into perspective just how long this game has been development they actually have a green light trailer which was published six years ago green light that's the thing that existed before seem direct I went through green light myself a few times many many years ago so yeah this one has definitely been in development for a very long time at some point they finally put the game on scene and we can actually go into cmdb and check however seem to be actually only goes back all the way back to 2019 but still at this point in 2019 they already had 7 000 followers now the general rule is that wishing lists are about 10 times smaller so back in 2019 they already had about 70 000 wishlists now that is a massive amount I'm actually currently working on my upcoming steam

of the biggest Indie hits of not just this year but many many years it seemingly came out of nowhere but in reality was being developed for over seven years so congrats to the developers on making an excellent game and finding huge success thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
