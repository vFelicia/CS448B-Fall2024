02:04 - more so the whole thing looks like a
02:07 - really great very complete icon pack if
02:09 - your game has some sand where the player
02:10 - can walk on then maybe this Shader can
02:12 - help punish that you have some sand you
02:15 - can remove the sand in certain parts so
02:17 - it's a simple effect but adding this to
02:19 - your character's footsteps or maybe some
02:20 - vehicle tracks adding that would really
02:22 - give it that extra bit of punish then if
02:25 - you need a good realistic sitting look

02:29 - little bit dystopian very Brown very
