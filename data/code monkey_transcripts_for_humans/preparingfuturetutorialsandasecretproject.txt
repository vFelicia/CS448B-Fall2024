00:28 - oh
00:52 - [Music]
01:02 - hey everyone how's it going thanks for
01:04 - being
01:05 - here
01:07 - nice okay now I have to say this stream
01:09 - is a bit off to a rocky start because
01:13 - for some reason Unity just randomly it
01:16 - seems like their license server is down
01:19 - so the goal is to do a bit of work but
01:22 - now I can't open Unity so there's some
01:25 - issue with the license server
01:28 - so yeah I have to say this kind of
01:31 - screws up my plans so let's see if this
01:34 - gets fixed or not so that's definitely
01:36 - bad timing since such a thing has never
01:39 - happened to me before so yeah that's a
01:41 - bit
01:43 - tricky uh but yeah let's
01:45 - see all
01:48 - right yeah definitely a a tricky start
01:51 - but hey everyone hey thanks for being
01:53 - here let's see if I can manage to figure
01:56 - out
01:58 - something but yeah
02:00 - uh just take out the
02:03 - background
02:05 - uh right cuz yeah if I can't open Unity
02:08 - that is going to make this a little bit
02:10 - tricky which I guess by the way now is a
02:13 - good time to ask all of you so are you
02:15 - having the same issue or is it just
02:19 - me uh you just opened a project okay so
02:22 - is it just me cuz basically this is what
02:25 - I'm seeing enable to refresh license try
02:26 - again then I try again and nope nothing
02:29 - happened
02:31 - so yeah that's uh person 500k thank you
02:35 - thank you so much uh so yeah is it just
02:38 - me are you all able to open up Unity
02:40 - right now cuz yeah I just opened up the
02:43 - unity Hub and apparently there's some
02:46 - issue with the license
02:47 - [Music]
02:49 - server L out and try again uh okay let's
02:53 - see if that does work cuz basically this
02:55 - is always signed in but it seems like it
02:58 - can't really
03:00 - all right let's
03:02 - see okay it signs in automatically and
03:05 - it signed in
03:07 - but nope still says enable to refresh
03:11 - license let me let me read
03:14 - chat no issue here open the project a
03:16 - while ago okay so that's very strange
03:19 - never had such a thing works fine for me
03:22 - oh come on so it's just a me issue
03:25 - literally on the only time that I decide
03:27 - to do a live stream okay so that's
03:30 - that's
03:54 - tricky okay so have to say this
03:56 - definitely quite a bit
03:58 - of
04:01 - uh Hey from edisa hey nice thank you
04:05 - thanks for being here uh okay so let's
04:08 - see if I can figure this
04:11 - out cuz yeah being unable to open Unity
04:14 - kind of makes a little bit of a tricky
04:28 - thing
04:34 - okay so yeah
04:36 - very very
04:53 - strange okay so I found a temporary fix
04:57 - maybe is it loading
05:14 - okay so I just tried uh
05:17 - activating a personal license and
05:19 - apparently that
05:21 - works so very strange but okay sure I
05:25 - mean right now I don't really need Pro
05:27 - anyway or actually I would like to try
05:30 - out Muse I would like to try it out a
05:32 - little bit there are some tutorials
05:34 - where I could use some nice material so
05:36 - I'd like to try it out but
05:39 - yeah it's like when your manager comes
05:41 - over and everything spits in your face
05:43 - yeah that seems to be the case I mean
05:44 - this has never happened to me
05:47 - so uh yeah very strange let's see
05:51 - if it's currently un loading let's see
05:54 - if this does
05:58 - open
06:16 - all right so yeah sorry for a rough
06:18 - start to the live stream trying to
06:21 - figure this out but okay okay so
06:23 - apparently it is working so I had to
06:26 - grab a personal license so that is very
06:27 - strange because I'm pretty sure my Pro
06:30 - license was at the end but anyways
06:31 - doesn't matter so it should be good all
06:34 - right okay so I can finally do a little
06:36 - bit of work and let's see if everything
06:38 - else goes
06:41 - okay yeah I'm not even quite looking at
06:44 - all the windows since everything got
06:45 - messed up so let me just okay let me
06:47 - actually prepare things cuz now it does
06:50 - seem to be correct so okay let me just
06:55 - do uh all right okay so this should be
06:58 - good so basically I'm going to
06:59 - prepare some upcoming tutorials uh I got
07:03 - to prepare the demo scene so that then I
07:05 - can record the actual proper tutorial so
07:09 - that's basically what I'm going to try
07:10 - to be doing whil trying to reach out
07:12 - trying to do all kinds of things so
07:15 - let's
07:17 - see a cnth acid pack and want to do a
07:19 - flash on the 3D object when it gets
07:21 - damaged what is the easiest way to do
07:22 - that if I'm not an artist to make
07:24 - artwork for it I mean to make a flash
07:26 - you really just need some some emission
07:29 - so like for example I actually I
07:30 - actually need to drag a character here
07:32 - so let me actually uh I'm going to pick
07:35 - up one from these one from these so
07:37 - basic character and I just need to
07:40 - update the thing because apparently I
07:42 - didn't so let me go into rendering to
07:44 - the
07:46 - converter and yep built into urp
07:49 - material upgrade usize and convert okay
07:52 - so that should work uh yeah so basically
07:54 - the easiest way to add some damage kind
07:56 - of thing that would be some kind of
07:59 - material emission like for example let's
08:01 - see this hat what is the kind of
08:02 - material let me make a material with
08:04 - emission so just up here create a brand
08:07 - new material let me go into the hat and
08:11 - drag the material onto the hat and on
08:14 - this one I can go and enable submission
08:17 - put the emission un like white or red I
08:19 - guess if you want to get hit that would
08:21 - be in
08:22 - red uh just increase emission increase
08:25 - the intensity and just need to make sure
08:28 - that I've got towards my processing
08:29 - volume My volume just make sure to make
08:32 - the volume quite intense okay I disabled
08:34 - the special effects and there you go so
08:37 - yeah basically if you wanted the easiest
08:39 - way to do that you really don't need to
08:40 - do any art sort of thing so you can just
08:44 - use a simple emission and just play
08:46 - around the intensity so as the player
08:48 - gets hit really increase it and then
08:50 - slowly bring it down so animated through
08:53 - some kind of
08:54 - interpolation so I've got a nice quick
08:57 - video on smooth with lurp so that's
08:59 - pretty much what I would do just lurp it
09:02 - increase the emission and decrease it
09:04 - and it's a really nice flash effect
09:06 - super easy to do so just increase boom
09:09 - and goes down so yep back to normal so
09:12 - yep that's pretty much what I would do
09:13 - something pretty simple use any
09:16 - framework for dep pendency injection
09:17 - nope not really I've heard great things
09:20 - about zenject and I've seen some videos
09:22 - on it but nope never really use it
09:25 - myself it's a it's a really interesting
09:27 - thing and I do try to make it so that my
09:29 - my code technically could be uh could
09:31 - work with some dependency injection so I
09:33 - use tons of interface tons of stuff but
09:36 - nope never actually use it so
09:39 - yeah won't that overr right the default
09:41 - texture uh yep if you have a glow it is
09:43 - going to work on top of the texture but
09:46 - that's pretty much what you want so if
09:49 - the base map is of a different color so
09:52 - if this one is supposed to be green then
09:54 - yeah that is going to look a bit strange
09:56 - but as goes down and you disable the
09:58 - emission then then goes back to normal
09:59 - so pretty much enable go up then go down
10:02 - when go down disable and so on but yeah
10:05 - that is the easiest way to do that
10:08 - congrats on 500k can we make custom
10:11 - gravity for different players in the
10:12 - same scene in
10:14 - 2D uh I don't think you uh can you do
10:18 - that I actually haven't used Tod physics
10:21 - in in quite a while but if I make just a
10:24 - basic Circle and I add a origin body 2D
10:28 - doesn't this one yeah this one does have
10:29 - a gravity scale so yep you can
10:30 - definitely have one with a gravity scale
10:33 - of something so let's put this one
10:35 - where's my camera cuz everything is far
10:38 - away where's the camera looking at okay
10:40 - it's looking at the other side so
10:43 - yep so yeah you can modify the gravity
10:46 - scale on that one just make this quite a
10:49 - bit smaller just make it two put oh
10:53 - great now it's not visible all right
10:56 - let's put in nice Cas your nice red
10:59 - and this one on the side now this one
11:01 - put it on one and now they should fall
11:04 - at different rates I mean two directions
11:06 - of gravity okay so that nope gravity
11:09 - always falls down on the Y I don't think
11:11 - you can change that so if that's the
11:14 - kind of thing that you need for a game
11:15 - then I would say the best answer is
11:16 - really just handle the gravity yourself
11:18 - so don't rely on the rigid body handling
11:20 - the gravity if you want you can still
11:22 - use a rigid body just make it so that
11:23 - it's kinematic so that you actually move
11:25 - it yourself and you basically implement
11:27 - the the gravity using some math yourself
11:31 - that that would pretty much be it so
11:32 - really just have a vector and then have
11:34 - the gravity Vector point to whatever
11:36 - Direction you want it to be and yeah you
11:38 - basically just need to handle it
11:39 - yourself because I don't think that is
11:41 - natively
11:43 - supported
11:46 - okay uh right active Ron can be
11:49 - triggered to set up that is actually
11:50 - something that I've been wanting to
11:52 - research for quite some time active
11:54 - ragon they are always quite interesting
11:56 - let me just unpack this prefab just so
11:58 - that I don't break the
12:01 - original uh yep so let put the character
12:04 - so Vis I'm going to need the character
12:07 - looking at did I modify yeah I did
12:08 - modify the intensity that is way too
12:10 - intense let me just move the camera a
12:12 - little bit where's my camera I put a
12:15 - player control but I don't need a player
12:17 - control on this one I just need a static
12:19 - camera so basically over here I'm
12:21 - preparing for a uh oh crap that is way
12:24 - too much for a tutorial on how to do
12:27 - character customization pretty much like
12:29 - I did in my game dinky Guardians that is
12:32 - pretty much the goal so Bas only going
12:34 - to have the character and then to the
12:36 - side of it there's going to be a menu in
12:37 - order to customize the
12:40 - thing so basically over here I'm
12:42 - preparing the scene which I will then
12:43 - use in the in the in the tutorial and so
12:46 - on I know if you're looking to go or
12:49 - have already looked into it nope I've
12:51 - I've seen a bunch of GDC talks talking
12:54 - about it it seems like in AAA
12:55 - development GOP is really used if if you
12:58 - don't know what is GOP that means I
13:00 - always forget
13:03 - go go something action oriented oh crap
13:07 - I for or action planning I always forget
13:09 - what the acronym means but yeah it's a
13:11 - it's a very interesting way of doing
13:13 - like behaviors and things so yeah I've
13:15 - definitely seen it being used in a ton
13:17 - of GDC talks I'm pretty sure I saw a
13:20 - bunch of those for Watch Dogs yeah goal
13:23 - oriented action planning yeah that's the
13:24 - one uh yeah so it is really interesting
13:27 - but nope I've never used it myself but
13:29 - yeah definitely something that I would
13:30 - like to research in the future because
13:32 - it's definitely an interesting way to
13:34 - handle
13:35 - behaviors uh okay so in order to prepare
13:38 - for tutal basically I'm going to need
13:40 - the character and the way that this
13:41 - character customization Works actually
13:43 - super simple because all based just on
13:46 - meshes so the way this one works so like
13:49 - it has a backpack and the way this asset
13:51 - pack is set up it's pretty much just
13:53 - modify the mesh just modify the mesh and
13:55 - that modifies all the customization so
13:57 - basically all it takes is really just a
13:59 - simple menu with a bunch of buttons for
14:01 - those buttons in order to modify things
14:04 - so yeah let me also make did I
14:07 - import the
14:09 - UI
14:11 - nope now you're a Unity guy curious how
14:14 - long you spent in in real or any other
14:15 - game engine uh the answer is nothing I
14:19 - think I've opened in real like once or
14:20 - twice but no never really I mean pretty
14:23 - much when I transition from Flash and I
14:25 - wanted to make some PC games that's when
14:27 - I started looking into engine
14:29 - where's my package manager oh there it
14:31 - is uh when I started looking into uh PC
14:35 - games back then uh I looked at my
14:38 - options and pretty much the only valid
14:40 - option was just Unity so yeah that was
14:42 - pretty much that's pretty much how I
14:44 - select back in 2012 I was looking for an
14:47 - engine that could make games and that
14:48 - was free Unity was the only option so
14:50 - yeah I picked unity and since then I
14:52 - continue using it just because I already
14:54 - know how to work with it and it does
14:56 - everything that I wanted to do so yeah
14:58 - because that nope I've never really
15:00 - explored other engines it's always one
15:02 - of those things where if I had infinite
15:03 - time I'd love to I'd love to spend some
15:05 - time in order to actually learn and see
15:08 - what they do different what they do
15:10 - better what does unity do worse what
15:12 - could Unity improve and things like that
15:13 - I think that's very very important very
15:15 - useful to be able to compare with the
15:18 - competition as it were and try to see
15:21 - what they do better and what you could
15:23 - do better but yeah as always my issue
15:25 - it's always the same so I can never find
15:27 - the time so it's always quite
15:29 - tricky the 3. lurp what we use for the
15:31 - third parameter if you want it
15:33 - interpolation uh linear interpolation
15:36 - then you use basally a number that
15:37 - increases from 0 to
15:39 - one YouTube's not receiving enough video
15:42 - to maintain smooth streaming is the
15:43 - stream lagging what is going on oh it
15:47 - was probably just CU it was updating G
15:49 - Pro anyways uh so yeah on lurp you can
15:52 - either use just an interpolation if you
15:54 - wanted to use the value from 0 to one or
15:57 - alternatively you can modify the
15:59 - original which I'm pretty sure is what I
16:00 - did in this video where I really like
16:04 - how I use lurp which technically it
16:05 - should be used it should be used well
16:07 - the main goal is to be used let me just
16:09 - mute it the main goal is to make it uh
16:12 - linear interpolation but way that I use
16:14 - it basically I use the transform that
16:15 - position as the first value which means
16:17 - that the distance between the start and
16:19 - the end value that distance is
16:20 - constantly getting smaller so by using
16:22 - that essentially makes us kind of smooth
16:24 - so it kind of moves quickly and then
16:25 - slows down as it reaches a point and yep
16:28 - so
16:29 - so yeah for the third time for third
16:31 - value usually I just use the time on
16:33 - time multiplied by some speed and yeah
16:35 - lurp is one of those things that is
16:36 - super
16:37 - useful like you've got two positions and
16:39 - then you can smoothly interpolate
16:41 - between them and I think I personally
16:42 - think that this one the uh ease in ease
16:45 - out I think this is ease out yeah
16:48 - because starts off fast and then goes
16:49 - slow yeah I think this is the one that
16:51 - is super useful so yep that is pretty
16:55 - much how I do
16:56 - it should I you stop down engine for my
16:59 - new game I mean that depends if you're
17:00 - making something that is top down then
17:03 - yeah the top down engine I'm pretty sure
17:05 - I've used it I haven't made a full
17:07 - review on it but I've used it quite a
17:08 - little bit and yep it does seem quite
17:11 - capable so yeah if you want to make
17:12 - something in top down top down shooter
17:14 - or something like that then yeah that
17:15 - can definitely help you speed up and get
17:17 - it to a really nice prototype really
17:23 - quickly all right so here I just need
17:26 - need
17:27 - the
17:29 - I'm just importing some UI assets just
17:31 - make oh hey custom character hey nice
17:33 - Game Dev JJ hey nice by the way if you'd
17:36 - like to make your own custom character
17:38 - you can do it so you can go on to the
17:39 - website you can draw on your own mesh
17:42 - and draw your character and make it
17:44 - exactly anything you want just let me
17:47 - know when it is because needs a manual
17:49 - approval process come out for tning
17:52 - lping with only a single
17:54 - call uh yeah you pretty much need kind
17:57 - of a SN or code routine or in my case I
18:00 - use my function upat class which has
18:03 - where's my where's my code my visual
18:05 - studio uh yeah basically I just got a
18:07 - super useful class in my utilities that
18:09 - I've used tons and tons of time which is
18:11 - pretty much okay let me just import this
18:15 - a crap everything
18:16 - is uh where's my's my window yeah I got
18:21 - to say my PC does become quite a bit
18:23 - slower as that's actually interesting am
18:26 - I streaming at 60 FPS that maybe why
18:30 - maybe why it's a little bit I should
18:31 - probably change that can I change it on
18:34 - the Fly no I don't think
18:36 - so cuz yeah I should probably not be
18:39 - streaming 60 FPS seems like that's a bit
18:41 - unnecessary but anyway sure so yeah just
18:44 - a little bit uh yeah what was I saying
18:47 - I've got my function
18:50 - updator is it still it's still loading
18:53 - my function up dat class which is my
18:54 - utilities if you like to use it go ahead
18:56 - feel free to use it and this one is
18:58 - super useful to me because basically it
19:00 - just creates an object which takes an
19:01 - action and then just runs that action on
19:04 - every update so this is super easy to
19:06 - use like what is the script I don't know
19:08 - but yeah so basically I just go into
19:10 - function updator and I create a new
19:12 - function updator then inside I pass any
19:14 - kind of thing run this every update so
19:18 - for example
19:19 - transform. position equals Vector 3.
19:22 - lurp and I would lurp not left lurp lurp
19:25 - from this transform. position to a
19:28 - Target position of some kind time do
19:30 - time multiply by some kind of speed so
19:32 - then it Flo for the speed 10f and a
19:35 - vector three for me Target
19:38 - position and this would be a new Vector
19:41 - 3 on 0 0 0 something like that and yeah
19:45 - so basically this is what I would do and
19:46 - this would be just one line of code and
19:47 - then the function updator that One
19:49 - automatically constructs a game object
19:51 - it automatically attaches a mon behavior
19:53 - and pretty much just would run this
19:55 - constantly and then I've got a second
19:57 - optional parameter not the function name
19:59 - but there's one for the yeah for my
20:01 - update Funk instead of receiving there's
20:04 - one for just action just runs this
20:06 - constantly on every single update
20:07 - Non-Stop and then there's another one
20:09 - that takes a funk which returns a
20:10 - bullion which basically when that one
20:12 - returns true that is when that one
20:13 - actually destroys the underlying object
20:15 - so basically what I would do is do this
20:17 - then just return a vector 3. distance
20:21 - distance between the transform out
20:22 - position and the target position and if
20:25 - that distance is within 01 F then
20:27 - basically that would destroy this h and
20:28 - stop running that code so yep basically
20:31 - if you want to do it in just one line
20:33 - personally I use my function of data
20:34 - class this is so useful I'm pretty sure
20:36 - I made this when did I make
20:38 - this in the hyperight days hyperight
20:41 - days I guess which was quite a long time
20:43 - ago when did I launch that game s
20:46 - power.com when did I launch that game uh
20:50 - hyper knights was that in
20:52 - 2016 uh 2017 okay so yeah basically
20:55 - there's a lot of the code that I
20:57 - basically this this game this was the
21:00 - sort of the first game since since I
21:02 - really started learning about writing
21:04 - clean code about making making code that
21:07 - is nice reusable super usable intens of
21:09 - projects so yeah pretty much the code
21:11 - base that I made on this I'm pretty sure
21:12 - most of the utilities I made back when I
21:14 - made this game which was back in 2017
21:17 - and nowadays yep uh the code that I use
21:19 - in this game I still use it nowadays so
21:21 - that is super useful something that I
21:23 - wrote literally 17 that was what 6 years
21:25 - ago something that I wrote six years ago
21:29 - and nowadays it is still super useful a
21:31 - lot of the code that I use here a lot of
21:33 - the code in my utilities I'm still using
21:34 - in my own game Dy gardiens which I just
21:36 - launched so yeah it's kind of funny when
21:38 - you've got tons of tons of tons of code
21:40 - that you can then reuse and help you
21:42 - through the course of tons of projects
21:45 - oh hey the steam Awards that's fun uh
21:48 - right okay so what was I doing okay this
21:50 - fin no it did not okay I forgot to click
21:53 - on import so just doing
21:56 - something get let me read chat cuz I'm a
21:59 - a little bit little bit oh wow 245
22:02 - people wow that's insane I got to say
22:04 - when I think about numbers about
22:06 - anything that I do on this channel and
22:07 - something it's always insane like my
22:09 - mind cannot picture 250 people but
22:11 - apparently there are 250 people watching
22:13 - this so thanks for being here yeah
22:16 - that's a it's quite crazy which of
22:19 - course if I complete the whole Unity
22:20 - pathway created with code I've actually
22:22 - never done that I've heard great things
22:24 - about that unity and learn course but
22:25 - never done it uh if I complete that then
22:28 - overcook and turn based will sh my
22:30 - skills provide solid foundation yep I
22:32 - would say that's an excellent path I
22:33 - mean I haven't done the C with code but
22:35 - I've heard great things about it so yeah
22:36 - if you start with that one and then go
22:38 - through my kitchen chaos course that
22:40 - will definitely take it to like
22:41 - intermediate level and then if you take
22:43 - the turn-based strategy course that will
22:44 - then take you into a more advanced level
22:46 - so yep if you follow that if you follow
22:48 - those three then yep by the end you will
22:50 - have quite a lot of knowledge r on un
22:53 - Awards oh thank you uh they actually
22:55 - said they that they made some physical
22:57 - Awards wordss that they were going to
22:58 - send out so I'm very curious to see what
23:01 - that looks like that is going to be
23:02 - funny pen spinning I already tried but
23:05 - it's difficult yeah uh yeah doing this
23:09 - is pretty much the only trick that I
23:10 - know I started learning pen spinning
23:12 - back when I was I don't know when I was
23:14 - like 12 years old when I was a kid and I
23:16 - found a website called px. comom I don't
23:20 - even remember where I saw the videos but
23:22 - yeah that was something crazy and yeah I
23:25 - really I really got hooked into it for
23:27 - quite well I learned a ton of Tricks but
23:29 - yeah nowadays I pretty much just know
23:31 - the infinity and the thumb BR so just
23:33 - the absolute Basics I don't know
23:34 - anything
23:36 - else
23:38 - yeah see you shouldn't stream in 6 oh
23:40 - hey L Mania hey thanks for being here
23:42 - nice uh I really like to look in 60 FPS
23:45 - yeah I really like it for for videos but
23:48 - as I'm trying to do some work that is
23:49 - actually slowing down my Unity by quite
23:53 - a bit so yeah doing it 60 FPS right now
23:55 - that's a it's a bit tricky can't even
23:57 - intiate an object after in the same code
24:00 - to control its position and
24:02 - rotation not sure what you mean I mean
24:04 - if you call
24:05 - intiate you can do ineni and pass in
24:08 - some kind of game object prefab you can
24:11 - entiate with a prefab and then you've
24:13 - got this version with the original and
24:15 - the parent but then you also got this
24:16 - version so you can bring it Vector 3.0
24:19 - to spawn it on the zero and then qu.
24:22 - identity to spawn with no rotation so
24:24 - yep you can definitely spawn a prefab
24:27 - and position it right away although
24:29 - personally normally I do like transform
24:31 - for the spawn transform something like
24:33 - this so This should actually be a
24:35 - transform for the prefab
24:38 - transform so I usually spawn a transform
24:41 - I don't do anything then I go into this
24:43 - one that position equals new Vector 3
24:46 - put it down one two three something like
24:48 - that then rotate and so on so personally
24:49 - I normally do it in two lines but if you
24:51 - want it then definitely you can do it in
24:53 - just one
24:55 - line hey Paloma hey thanks for ring here
24:59 - nice wave do you too thanks uh is
25:05 - animating UI would animator bad practice
25:07 - not really so can you please make on UI
25:10 - twinning yeah usually for the UI you do
25:12 - want usually people mostly animate the
25:15 - eyi with tning but you can definitely do
25:17 - it with animations as well uh like for
25:20 - example that is what I use in my game
25:21 - okay I'm going to try to open another un
25:24 - thing and apparently
25:26 - my My Cloud is my Unity license is still
25:29 - messed up but I'm going to try to open
25:31 - another Unity project and hope nothing
25:34 - breaks uh but yeah pretty much you you
25:37 - can definitely use just animations and I
25:40 - did use just animations in my game but
25:44 - so yeah you can use both for some reason
25:46 - usually the convention is in the UI
25:48 - people like to interpolate a little bit
25:50 - more but yeah you can definitely use
25:52 - just regular animations okay let me just
25:54 - make a little canvas make it in World
25:57 - space
25:58 - or why I want it in World space no I
25:59 - think screen space that is probably a
26:01 - bit easier plans for NS tutorial yep
26:03 - I've been re researching dots for the
26:06 - past few weeks and uh yep definitely
26:09 - want to make another one but at the same
26:11 - time I'm working on tons of things at
26:13 - the same time so I'm already super busy
26:15 - for the next week but yeah I wanted to
26:18 - do it before the end of this of this
26:20 - month but it might be early next month
26:22 - but yep definitely interested in getting
26:24 - back into
26:26 - dots uh
26:28 - actually yeah cuz I'm I'm trying to
26:30 - think how I'm going
26:32 - to organize the
26:36 - UI or rather how to organize the the
26:39 - tutorial itself why light mode because
26:41 - dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty
26:43 - much it uh let me just scale with screen
26:47 - size 1920 by 1080 scale with a height
26:51 - and yep cuz this seemed quite a bit
26:53 - higher uh all right inside let me put
26:56 - not inside this one put inside put an
26:59 - image and yeah I wanted to make it look
27:01 - similar to my game that one is still
27:04 - opening so I assume the stream is a
27:06 - little bit slow right now since I'm
27:08 - trying to open another project at the
27:10 - same
27:12 - time personally I do dark mode in all I
27:15 - can
27:16 - yeah I know a lot of people prefer dark
27:19 - mode but yeah for me it doesn't I don't
27:20 - know why my eyes are broken I don't know
27:23 - but yeah for me it really does not work
27:26 - looking at something uh looking at White
27:29 - letters in a dark background for some
27:32 - reason my eyes cannot focus they get all
27:34 - messed up very quickly so yep for me it
27:37 - simply does not
27:40 - work okay so here's my that crap here's
27:45 - my game and someone was talking about uh
27:48 - let me load up the other one where's my
27:51 - where's my scenes my scenes let me go
27:53 - inside my game
27:56 - scene and inside the game scene a while
27:59 - ago people were asking about 2D
28:02 - animations where's my where's my
28:04 - UI why is my UI missing where did I put
28:08 - it is because
28:11 - it's where's my UI okay my UI just
28:14 - suddenly vanished why did you
28:17 - vanish where is my canvas 3D okay it's
28:19 - behind all that that's the issue with
28:21 - the with the yeah okay yeah uh so
28:26 - basically on all of these this is how I
28:28 - handle my UI this is the canvas 3D so
28:30 - this is the 3D y that has that sort of
28:33 - nice little thing and for example over
28:35 - here for the grab machine the itom grab
28:37 - machine inside I've got a container and
28:40 - Yep this one is using a regular animat
28:42 - game object so an animator I've got a
28:44 - simple animator just literally just a
28:46 - single animation just a window popup and
28:49 - on this one if I inspect the animation
28:52 - and yep that's what it does so it just
28:54 - moves up and has a nice little squish
28:56 - just to make it a little bit more
28:57 - satisfying but yep it's a regular
28:59 - animation component so every time that I
29:01 - inspect something that is pretty much
29:04 - what what happened so yeah basically to
29:06 - answer that question about can you use
29:08 - the animated in UI absolutely you can so
29:11 - it's really personal preference if you
29:12 - want you can do it based
29:14 - on where's the continue button if you
29:17 - want you can use it based on
29:18 - interpolation but if you also want to do
29:21 - it is this muted cuz I don't want to
29:23 - mess up the the thing uh but yeah so if
29:27 - you want you can make it based on
29:29 - animations oh that's a cool character uh
29:31 - or you can just make them like this so
29:33 - this is a regular animation so just as I
29:35 - inspect and there you go it comes up
29:38 - looks really nice and
29:40 - satisfying all right okay dzui yeah I've
29:44 - definitely heard good things about that
29:46 - I've seen a ton of great reviews on the
29:48 - EST I've actually never used one of
29:50 - those really complex UI Frameworks I
29:53 - know there are a bunch of them and they
29:54 - all seem to have very positive reviews
29:56 - but I've never actually use them so
29:59 - that's that's definely something that I
30:01 - would love to try out to see exactly
30:02 - what they
30:06 - do will you ever create a multiplayer
30:08 - FPS tutorial uh sure if I had infinite
30:11 - time I definitely would that's always my
30:13 - problem I mean I wish I could make a
30:15 - complete 20-hour course on every single
30:17 - genre imaginable so making an RTS making
30:20 - a multiplayer FPS making a survival
30:22 - crafting game even making something like
30:24 - Flappy Bird or Pac-Man just the basics
30:27 - I'd love to be able to make like 20 30
30:29 - courses but each course takes like I
30:31 - don't know two three months to make so
30:34 - basically for me to build all the ideas
30:36 - that I already have in my head that
30:37 - would already take me like five years So
30:40 - eventually over time I would love to be
30:41 - able to have a ton of content on pretty
30:44 - much every single genre imaginable but
30:46 - yeah it's definitely going to take quite
30:47 - a bit of work to to get to that point
30:49 - that's going to be quite
30:52 - tricky I'm using your multiplayer game
30:54 - as a template for mine it's incredibly
30:56 - helpful oh that's awesome that's cool
30:58 - hey best of luck with the game yeah
31:00 - multiplayer is tricky so yeah I really
31:02 - hope it helps nice what's difference
31:04 - between making a timer in update versus
31:06 - co- routine versus
31:08 - async uh I mean in terms of the final
31:11 - goal those are pretty much all the same
31:14 - meaning those are all timers those all
31:15 - do things you can do it on update with a
31:17 - flow timer that is usually the thing
31:19 - that I prefer that is usually the
31:21 - simplest way just have a FL timer count
31:23 - it down when it's in laps do something
31:25 - pretty simple code routines I don't
31:27 - really like them because of the pattern
31:29 - they force you to use like you are
31:30 - forced to use a game object with a mon
31:32 - of behavior then you are also forced to
31:34 - uh return a numerator you've got to make
31:37 - yield returns and all kinds of things so
31:39 - personally I don't like all that pattern
31:40 - that Co routines Force but it it is
31:43 - valid it does achieve the same final
31:45 - result so yeah and async that is uh also
31:48 - another valid option that one is just
31:50 - something that I haven't really gotten
31:51 - used to ASN is still I don't know it's a
31:55 - little bit strange it's a little bit
31:57 - confusing although likely the unity
31:59 - packages a bunch of them have been have
32:01 - been um they've been using async white
32:05 - so because of that I've had to learn it
32:06 - and nowadays so quite a bit more more
32:09 - interesting uh I definitely find it
32:11 - quite a bit easier to understand now
32:12 - that I've spent some time working with
32:14 - those packages so yep asyn wa that is
32:16 - also another valid so pretty much all
32:18 - three of those those are all options
32:20 - really just choose the one that best
32:22 - serves you needs the one that you best
32:24 - prefer for me I really like simple float
32:26 - timer so so yep that's pretty much it
32:30 - love this chat template nice thanks uh
32:33 - yeah this is a a fun
32:35 - overlay just want to tell Code Monkey
32:38 - how helpful is oh that's awesome thank
32:39 - you so much and if you want to know how
32:41 - I made this overlay I covered a bunch of
32:44 - tutorials where I did this so if you
32:46 - want to go to the end of that page and
32:48 - you can definitely do it so this is a
32:50 - transparent Unity window all these
32:52 - characters these are all using mesh
32:54 - based animations in order to interact
32:56 - with YouTube API that's just a simple
32:58 - HTTP request and the characters these
33:00 - are actually a while ago I was talking
33:01 - about how I've reused tons of code from
33:03 - previous games and over here I'm using a
33:06 - bunch of code and art from previous game
33:08 - so these characters down here if you've
33:09 - played my game battle round Tycoon you
33:11 - won't recognize these characters these
33:12 - are pretty much exactly the same so if I
33:14 - search for Battle Royale Tycoon and
33:17 - there's my game oh yeah there's the seam
33:19 - sale I totally forgot it was discount
33:22 - anyways uh yeah so you can look at the
33:23 - characters down here yep they definitely
33:25 - match these characters so yeah that's
33:27 - another awesome thing when you make tons
33:28 - of projects tons of things you build up
33:30 - a library of lots of things that you can
33:32 - then use over time so yep all these
33:35 - Sprites that I drew this game was in
33:37 - like 2018 so I drew these Sprites back
33:39 - in 2018 that was like 5 years ago and
33:42 - now when I made this nice little overlay
33:44 - I was able to reuse the Sprites reuse
33:46 - the animation code and so on so yeah
33:48 - that is why I always talk about so much
33:50 - when it comes to uh writing good clean
33:52 - code and code reusability it's because
33:54 - it is this important like when you do
33:56 - something uh you can then reuse it and
33:58 - save a ton of time do you have a secret
34:01 - project uh yeah that's uh something that
34:03 - I've been working on which yeah i' like
34:05 - to do in a little bit but first I just
34:07 - like to to get this one working so I
34:10 - just need okay what did I want let me
34:12 - just try to do little bit nice have a
34:15 - nice day hey you too uh okay so
34:18 - basically I just want okay where's my
34:19 - let me go into the to the other scene
34:23 - that's the Character Creator scene let
34:25 - me go inside
34:28 - and over here why is it in Portuguese I
34:30 - don't know uh but yeah so inside let's
34:34 - go I basically just want to reference
34:36 - this just to be able to find so the
34:39 - frame table Navy let's just find this
34:42 - one here just to make the demo scene for
34:45 - tutorial similar uh oh crap how am I
34:48 - going to move this okay down there let
34:51 - me just move where's my I don't know
34:53 - where's my where's my scene let me
34:55 - just uh over here just put in there and
34:59 - yeah so basally for the character
35:00 - customization I really just need oh
35:02 - right I need the I need an idle
35:05 - animation so I'm going to have to do
35:11 - that what is the character pack you are
35:14 - using the one over here in the demo I'm
35:16 - actually going to talk about that in the
35:18 - oh crap oh right I removed it uh yeah
35:20 - this one I'm going to talk about in the
35:23 - in the video but yeah if you want to
35:25 - know it has a strange name it's called
35:26 - character
35:29 - 7 uh and yep it's this one so basically
35:31 - this is the pack that I'm using this
35:33 - pack that I'm going to be using in that
35:34 - tutorial
35:36 - which okay I don't know if I can say if
35:39 - it's spoiler alert or not but I've been
35:41 - told this one is going to be on sale so
35:43 - definitely don't buy it right now
35:45 - definitely stay tuned for for the for
35:49 - the future I hope I don't get in trouble
35:51 - for saying that uh but yeah it's uh so
35:55 - I'm trying to make the video in order to
35:56 - to come out next week and the video will
35:58 - come will come out when the thing is on
36:01 - sale so that if you're interested in
36:03 - following along or in just downloading
36:05 - the thing then you can do
36:07 - it Network object
36:10 - pulling yeah that would be an
36:12 - interesting
36:14 - topic uh but more interesting topic is
36:17 - we're only just doing things about uh
36:18 - client side did I not move this did I
36:21 - not move the object oh never mind I'm
36:23 - looking at the wrong project uh yep so
36:26 - basically looking
36:27 - into client side prediction that is the
36:30 - main thing that I very much would like
36:31 - to very much would like to work on okay
36:35 - let me just fix the helmet and then let
36:38 - me try doing the other scene and then
36:40 - I'm going to oh crap what material
36:42 - should I be
36:43 - using this one so let me just copy this
36:46 - one choose the helmet and put it not
36:49 - this one this the hair it's not the hair
36:52 - where's the
36:53 - helmet which one is the helmet this is
36:55 - not the helmet
36:57 - oh crap I can select
36:58 - it it's not this one okay it's this one
37:03 - okay so it's the hat that was the helmet
37:05 - NGO plus addressables is an interesting
37:07 - topic that is interesting how to load
37:10 - things dynamically that sounds complex
37:13 - but yeah definitely definitely
37:15 - interesting which games do you play in
37:16 - your free time uh lately I haven't
37:19 - really had any free time I mean I made
37:21 - that really interesting video on the uh
37:24 - on all the mechanics in uh Assassin
37:26 - Creed Mirage I really enjoyed making
37:28 - this I definitely want to make more of
37:30 - this but yeah so basically I played like
37:31 - 4 hours in order to be able to make this
37:33 - video and since then I still haven't
37:35 - gotone back to it I really would like to
37:36 - so yeah definitely lately I haven't
37:38 - really had much time to play some games
37:40 - but definitely would like to PR 500k
37:42 - thank
37:45 - you okay so let me just quickly try
37:47 - doing the other scenes on this one okay
37:49 - right I keep forgetting what I'm doing
37:51 - uh over here I really just want to add a
37:54 - simple uh animator do I have an idol
37:58 - animation this project I probably do
38:01 - Crouch I don't want to crouch an
38:03 - idol oh that's see Kevin's back very
38:06 - useful okay let's see if this has a
38:08 - regular animator long usually does it
38:11 - take to make a simple game uh that
38:12 - really depends on your definition of
38:14 - simple and also on your own skill set I
38:16 - mean if you're making something like
38:18 - Flappy Bird that's pretty simple so why
38:23 - isn't oh cuz I forgot to assign the
38:24 - Avatar uh yeah so for making something
38:27 - like doesn't this have an avatar this
38:28 - doesn't have an avatar uh if you're
38:30 - making something like Flappy Bird and
38:32 - you're very experienced like I'm pretty
38:33 - sure I could make a Flappy Bird colog in
38:35 - under an hour something like that so
38:37 - yeah that can definitely be done but
38:39 - yeah if you're a beginner I don't know
38:41 - something like FL bird would take like
38:43 - two weeks maybe I don't know it's been
38:45 - it's been a long time since I was a
38:47 - beginner and more than that it's been a
38:49 - back when I was beginner there weren't
38:51 - as many resources so yeah nowadays with
38:53 - all the resources with all the things
38:55 - hopefully it should be relatively easy
38:57 - in order
38:58 - to uh in order to be able to learn and
39:01 - do things doesn't
39:04 - this do I have to okay now I'm a bit
39:07 - confused I don't remember I thought this
39:09 - one came with an avatar pre-made didn't
39:12 - it let me go into my player visual just
39:15 - seeing hey Super Chat thanks so much I
39:18 - can't get past four views any tips oh
39:20 - boy uh YouTube is really extremely
39:23 - difficult so yeah I don't know that
39:25 - depends on what what topic you're going
39:28 - for are you going for tutorials cuz
39:30 - tutorials are indeed extremely difficult
39:34 - uh okay so I need to make the Avatar uh
39:36 - yeah making tutorials that is extremely
39:40 - difficult let just go make this humanoid
39:42 - from this one so yeah if you're making
39:45 - tutorials then yeah it is really
39:46 - difficult to get views I mean the best
39:48 - thing the the best tip that I can give
39:50 - you which is also a really difficult tip
39:53 - is simply focus on titles and thumbnails
39:56 - it's it might sound odd but on YouTube
39:58 - that's pretty much that's pretty much
39:59 - how it goes I mean the titles and
40:01 - thumbnails are the most important thing
40:02 - if you don't get a good title in a good
40:04 - thumbnail then it doesn't really matter
40:06 - just how good the video is so yeah it
40:09 - kind of sucks to say but that's how
40:11 - that's how YouTube goes I mean the
40:12 - content is obviously very important I
40:14 - mean after people click on the title and
40:15 - thumbnail they have to be able to want
40:17 - to stick in so so the video has to be
40:19 - good enough to keep them engag but
40:22 - before before the the quality of the
40:25 - video itself is important before that
40:26 - comes the title and thumbnail because if
40:27 - people don't even click then it doesn't
40:29 - really matter how good the the video
40:31 - actually is which is kind of the same
40:32 - thing as on scam if you don't have a
40:35 - good title a good hook if people never
40:37 - actually buy your game then doesn't
40:38 - really matter if the game is extremely
40:39 - good or not because if people never
40:41 - click on it then it doesn't really
40:43 - matter so yeah the best tip that I can
40:45 - give you study a lot about titles and
40:48 - thumbnails like if you want to uh study
40:51 - up on YouTube research like I high
40:55 - recommend col and Samir the the podcast
40:59 - really awesome podcast with very uh very
41:02 - successful people on YouTube so that is
41:03 - really great from learning from how
41:05 - people do uh they also got the Creator
41:09 - support that's the name yeah create
41:11 - support another excellent podcast by the
41:13 - same people they talk about YouTube so
41:14 - if you want to learn about YouTube
41:15 - strategy I highly recommend you go
41:17 - research because yeah there's quite a
41:19 - lot to learn I mean steam is really
41:21 - difficult for finding success with Indie
41:23 - Games but YouTube is just as difficult
41:26 - or maybe even more difficult so yeah
41:28 - definitely something that you have to
41:30 - really learn and at the end of day it
41:31 - also takes time I mean right now this
41:34 - channel is on a really nice uh really
41:36 - nice size I mean I just recently hit
41:38 - 500,000 subscribers so yep like I said
41:40 - thank you all so much that is an awesome
41:42 - thing but yeah keep in mind that it took
41:43 - me 5 years to get to this point
41:46 - so yeah even if you do everything right
41:48 - at some point it just takes time so
41:51 - hopefully that answer helped uh okay so
41:55 - totally forgot I keep forgetting getting
41:56 - what I'm doing okay so I just want to
41:58 - apply the basic character Avatar just
42:00 - get this one with an idle animation and
42:03 - then yep there you go ID anation pretty
42:06 - basic pretty simple okay good oh it
42:09 - actually changes that's fun uh all
42:12 - right T me how to use serialized field
42:14 - instead of public oh nice that's
42:17 - awesome that is trly one of the main
42:19 - things if you just learn that just that
42:21 - will massively increase the code quality
42:24 - of your games it will massively decrease
42:26 - amount of bugs that you find so yeah if
42:28 - you just learn one thing from my videos
42:29 - you you learn that if you learn to not
42:31 - make everything public then that is
42:33 - really awesome and if any of you
42:36 - are uh have been here for a short while
42:40 - then you might not have seen yeah pretty
42:42 - much a video on that topic so I highly
42:44 - highly encourage you to watch this video
42:47 - again when you focus about not making
42:50 - everything public when you focus on
42:51 - making things private and only expose
42:53 - them if they need to be exposed if you
42:55 - just follow that that one simple rule
42:56 - that will massively increase the quality
42:58 - of your code and that one thing alone
43:01 - will definitely save you a ton of
43:04 - headaches okay all right so this
43:08 - is so this should be good enough to then
43:11 - make the tutorial now let me see this
43:13 - one the detector this is another one
43:16 - that is really cool which is another
43:18 - it's kind of funny how I was working on
43:20 - my game and now that I made my game I've
43:22 - got tons of videos that I want to do on
43:25 - interesting things that I made in my
43:26 - game and one of them is indeed this one
43:29 - so let me just put this in 2D where's my
43:32 - air detector I saw one there it is the
43:35 - air detector a real nice window although
43:38 - hopefully it's a window that people
43:39 - don't ever see but actually they might
43:42 - they might end up seeing but if they do
43:43 - then it kind of helps to be able to tell
43:45 - basically this pops up whenever the code
43:47 - detects an error so that is something
43:48 - that is really useful so that is also
43:51 - going to be a tutorial that I'm going to
43:52 - be working on I want to purchase a St
43:55 - pathfinding but 50 it's a little too
43:57 - much I have to use Nev mesh yeah I mean
43:59 - if you've got simple use case then Nev
44:01 - mesh works just fine I mean I would say
44:03 - you only need pathf finding you only
44:06 - need that asset if you absolutely need
44:08 - the performance but at the same time I'm
44:10 - pretty sure that one has a a free tier
44:12 - so depending on your use case AAR path
44:16 - finding project I'm pretty sure this one
44:20 - has a free tier so thanks again for the
44:22 - Super Chat I hope my answer helped uh if
44:24 - you go into
44:26 - yeah there's a free version so yeah if
44:29 - you uh can't afford the paid version I
44:31 - would send look into the free version I
44:33 - don't know what this one has what are
44:35 - the limitations but I'm pretty sure it
44:36 - also has multi-threading which is kind
44:38 - of like the main thing that I used uh
44:41 - that I used the ASD for so yep
44:43 - definitely try it out and hopefully that
44:46 - should help okay so let me see what did
44:48 - I want to do in this scene which is
44:50 - actually a scene from a tutorial that I
44:52 - already did and that now I want to do a
44:55 - bunch more things things oh boy this is
44:58 - way too sensitive oh crap yeah
45:01 - definitely whoa moving way too much all
45:04 - right so interact with this guy okay why
45:07 - is the text not showing up I'm not sure
45:08 - and why is it okay so I'll have to sort
45:12 - that out see why is the text not showing
45:15 - some kind of oh crap now my mouse is
45:17 - invisible uh use the old UI system or
45:21 - new UI tocket uh I would say right now
45:24 - still stick with unity UI
45:26 - just because UI T kit as far as I know
45:28 - it is still not production ready for uh
45:32 - runtime if you want to make editor tools
45:34 - and absolutely do use that but if you're
45:36 - trying to make uh ingame UI then yep I
45:40 - would say you
45:42 - absolutely okay okay so this one so it
45:45 - seems like I didn't cuz I'm pretty sure
45:47 - that I add a fix to this didn't I yeah
45:50 - chat bomb 3D I thought I did but
45:53 - apparently not because apparently this
45:55 - one needs yeah the hello
45:58 - inverted uh okay let me see where did
46:02 - I the chat bub on
46:06 - 3D so apparently I put this one wrong or
46:09 - maybe I just changed the code afterwards
46:11 - he that's it do shorts help you grow uh
46:14 - technically they should although I
46:16 - haven't really experimented with shorts
46:18 - way too much doing shorts for
46:20 - educational content is really quite
46:22 - tricky
46:23 - so so yeah that is one of those things
46:26 - that I would love to be able to do
46:28 - because yeah apparently they do work
46:29 - quite a lot but oh that's a thing really
46:33 - nice and open the door and yep that's
46:36 - good okay so that's the thing that I
46:37 - want to that I want to try out um yeah
46:40 - always use this un layout or try differ
46:43 - well I mean I Tred tons of un layouts
46:45 - until I found one that works and yep now
46:47 - I pretty much always use this so I've
46:49 - got my scene I've got my game view I got
46:51 - the inspector on the side the project
46:53 - with the console next to it and the
46:54 - hierarchy so yep after much trial and
46:56 - error this is pretty much what I've come
46:59 - to nice see you streaming hey thanks for
47:01 - being here yeah the stream got off to a
47:03 - bit of a rough start I still have to
47:05 - figure out what exactly that issue is
47:07 - but yeah thankfully now it kind of
47:15 - worked got to see my voice is already
47:17 - getting a bit messed up even though it's
47:18 - only been what like 30 minutes how long
47:21 - have I been streaming oh 45 minutes
47:24 - wasn't oh yeah started at 11:30 I
47:27 - thought I started at midday
47:31 - yep how do you feel about unit testing
47:34 - as a solo Dev feel it's not really
47:36 - necessary although it might be
47:37 - beneficial for teams yep that's that's
47:39 - pretty much how I feel about it I mean I
47:41 - do think unit testing is really awesome
47:43 - really cool and I definitely try to
47:46 - write my code so that it could be
47:48 - testable but at the same time yeah for a
47:50 - Sol Dev I pretty much I have to write
47:52 - code Non-Stop and yeah
47:56 - pretty much just don't have time to
47:57 - actually write unit test so in my case I
48:00 - try to write code as clean as possible I
48:02 - try to write code as if I was going to
48:04 - make tests so I try to keep things
48:05 - nicely decoupled but yeah I never
48:07 - actually write tests just because I mean
48:09 - I have to be so fast in order to be able
48:11 - to make games in a short enough amount
48:13 - of time so that the games are successful
48:15 - so yeah I never really have time to do
48:16 - unit tests
48:18 - but but yeah I would say if you're a
48:20 - solo Dev at least write code that should
48:23 - be testable and if you are on a team
48:24 - then yeah at that point writing unit
48:26 - test could probably be uh very important
48:29 - so yep uh what was I saying oh right I
48:33 - was trying to talk about this scene just
48:35 - in case you haven't seen this scene this
48:38 - is the NPC interaction system it's one
48:41 - of my favorite tutorials that I've done
48:42 - I really like the demo scene that I've
48:44 - did so yeah and it's another excellent
48:46 - use case of interfaces so that is really
48:49 - awesome oh boy so many messages trying
48:51 - to keep up with the work and answer
48:53 - questions so just one second cuz I just
48:55 - got a
48:56 - okay let me
48:59 - actually uh all right so basically over
49:01 - here I need to this is going to be the
49:03 - demo for the error detector so basically
49:05 - over here I need to trigger a bunch of
49:07 - errors and the first one that I want is
49:10 - over here on the door so I got to
49:12 - remember how exactly did I implement
49:14 - this so I've got a door
49:15 - interactable and on this door interact
49:18 - oh it was the the script that I had open
49:20 - and that I was writing a bunch of random
49:22 - code okay so basically when I interact I
49:24 - talk on the door
49:27 - and over here how do I do
49:31 - this uh okay let's say because if I do
49:35 - this equals null okay that is going to
49:37 - force a n reference or simly if I remove
49:39 - that and I've never actually get the
49:42 - reference that is going to do it but I
49:45 - think it's only going to trigger the
49:46 - error once and I actually need it to
49:48 - trigger constantly so let's see
49:53 - that I don't have time to watch want to
49:56 - thank you for teaching amazing stuff oh
49:57 - that's awesome thanks for the kind words
49:59 - I'm glad the videos have helped you make
50:02 - a tutorial on UI yet yep that is one of
50:04 - the many things on my toal list I very
50:06 - much would like to but yeah finding time
50:10 - is always a tricky thing I've done a
50:11 - bunch of research and look quite
50:13 - interesting and it seems to be going
50:14 - quite well and okay got an error nice
50:16 - that's exactly what I wanted so yeah can
50:19 - you try my first mobile game uh probably
50:21 - not I don't really usually play mobile
50:24 - games so
50:26 - what are box and leather what is wrong
50:28 - with these box and Leathers okay I don't
50:29 - know but apparently a bunch of these box
50:31 - and
50:32 - Leathers oh they got negative that's
50:36 - strange all right anyways um yeah so let
50:39 - me just yeah that's the problem that it
50:40 - caused the error but just once I need to
50:43 - cause the error multiple times
50:48 - so uh okay so how am I going to do
50:54 - this
50:58 - uh basically just want to trigger an
51:01 - error on every single
51:03 - update so that I can then test out that
51:06 - the airor detector is able to ignore
51:07 - errors that had already seen before
51:10 - where the secret project that is a some
51:13 - really interesting questions a really
51:14 - nice system that I've been working on
51:16 - for a while and in a little bit let me
51:17 - just finish this demo and then I'll
51:20 - showcase that super secret project it's
51:23 - actually not that secret but yeah um
51:25 - okay but if I do it like this it's going
51:27 - to um let me
51:29 - do yeah basically just only set it if
51:32 - it's true obviously this would not be
51:34 - production ready code but yep how come
51:37 - you don't release for mobile that's
51:39 - because mobile is a completely different
51:41 - completely separate
51:42 - World in terms of marketing it's a
51:45 - completely different thing it's all
51:46 - about paying for user acquisition all
51:48 - sorts of things mobile is really tricky
51:50 - not to mention of course the input I
51:52 - mean being able to use mouse and
51:53 - keyboard versus touch that is always
51:56 - going to be quite a big change so you
51:58 - can't really
52:00 - just convert the game into Mobile with
52:02 - just one click requires a ton of work
52:04 - and then since I don't know anything
52:06 - about marketing on mobile chances are it
52:08 - wouldn't be successful so yeah that is
52:10 - why I don't really do it although I
52:12 - wouldn't like to go into consolle so
52:14 - I've been researching that potential
52:16 - because that could be useful since the
52:17 - game is already playable on a gamad
52:19 - should be pretty easy to put on a
52:20 - console all right so it is triggering
52:23 - the error multiple times Exel isign
52:25 - intended okay so that's good what were
52:27 - the other errors that I
52:30 - wanted uh oh okay so the other ones I'm
52:32 - going to trigger when there's the all
52:35 - right so yeah that's about it so I just
52:37 - need the dragable
52:40 - window what means production ready code
52:42 - I mean it just means that I I would not
52:44 - do this I mean this is this is very
52:46 - wasteful code why is it checking for is
52:48 - open and then setting the bullion in
52:50 - every update this makes no sense this is
52:52 - just a waste of performance the correct
52:54 - code is the one that was previously
52:55 - which is the one that I taught in the
52:56 - original tutorial which is it only
52:58 - modifies the bullion on the animator
53:00 - just once whenever the whenever the door
53:02 - Chang state so yeah that's pretty much
53:05 - what you do just change the state once
53:06 - instead of constantly changing it every
53:08 - time but for this demo for the air
53:10 - detector I do want the air to spawn
53:11 - constantly so that is why I'm writing
53:13 - this nasty code just to make sure that
53:15 - the air spawns so that I can actually do
53:17 - tutorial for the nice air
53:24 - detector consol is nice but do you
53:26 - require a Unity version from nintend to
53:27 - release on switch uh you do need to have
53:30 - Unity Pro in order to be able to export
53:32 - the consoles and beyond that I uh beyond
53:35 - that you need to make a account with the
53:39 - various Dev uh account things so a
53:42 - Nintendo Dev account a Microsoft Dev
53:44 - account something like that so yeah it
53:46 - does require that but in terms of
53:47 - software in terms of the actual code I
53:49 - don't think it should require much
53:51 - changes but we'll see I mean it's going
53:53 - to be the first time cuz I've never done
53:54 - a console game gam so that is going to
53:56 - be an interesting journey and if I can
53:58 - talk about it that's a problem cuz
53:59 - consoles those are all always behind
54:01 - some heavy ndas so I'm not sure how much
54:04 - of that process I can talk about but
54:06 - once I go through that process I'll see
54:08 - what I can talk about maybe make an
54:09 - interesting
54:11 - video how do you research uh love to do
54:14 - a video on that I'm afraid that would
54:16 - not be a very interesting video because
54:17 - research basically just unload up the
54:19 - documentation and I read through it then
54:21 - I write the script for the for the video
54:24 - then I try it out myself I figur out how
54:26 - to organize things so yeah I don't think
54:28 - it would make for a very good video just
54:29 - to be me right here staring at things so
54:32 - like for example I'm working on the
54:34 - video on the unity localization package
54:37 - so what did I do I mean first of all
54:38 - I've used it myself in my game but then
54:40 - I came here to the official
54:42 - documentation I went through the guides
54:44 - and they've got a nice a quick start
54:46 - guide for this one so just went through
54:49 - this guide in order to see everything
54:51 - that the package can do cuz I didn't use
54:54 - all the features in my Gam so I want to
54:55 - see everything in order to be able to
54:57 - really cover it and basically just I
54:59 - read through this every time that I'm
55:01 - reading through I've got a un window
55:03 - open on the side that I'm constantly
55:04 - trying this out trying to make sure that
55:06 - everything works that I'm also writing
55:08 - the script for the video and so on so
55:10 - yeah basically uh my research process
55:12 - requires a lot of silently reading so I
55:16 - don't think it would make for a very
55:18 - engaging
55:19 - video uh right uh okay so I'm triggering
55:22 - that error then I just need do I got the
55:25 - drag window here oh I do actually I
55:28 - didn't think I did but I do okay so let
55:31 - me just make a dragon ball window does
55:33 - this have a canvas do I got a canvas I
55:35 - do have a canvas and inside oh I've got
55:38 - the player interact you y okay so let me
55:39 - just
55:40 - make just remember how I made that so a
55:43 - window and then I'm pretty sure the
55:46 - window is meant to have something then
55:49 - inside I've got some kind of background
55:52 - and for the background let's put it
55:53 - something like this
55:56 - and then let's make another one for the
55:58 - title
56:00 - background uh make it a bit more gray
56:03 - and for this
56:04 - one okay so let me just make a nice
56:07 - window here so 300 300 put it on the top
56:11 - left
56:12 - corner and put one z0 okay and for the
56:15 - title background put it something like
56:18 - this so yep pretty much EX down like
56:20 - that for the window I'm pretty sure this
56:22 - one is meant to have okay let me
56:27 - actually just a second I'm not reading
56:29 - chat right now I'm trying to figure this
56:32 - out uh so for ttle background let me
56:35 - incur it on the top left corner like
56:37 - this like this okay so now I need to
56:41 - remember how that I may not the drag
56:43 - drop but the drag Windows because I want
56:45 - to make a window that's dragable
56:47 - apparently I need a reference to the
56:49 - canvas and the drag wre transform oh
56:52 - okay so I think this is meant to be on
56:55 - the ton background I think this is how
56:57 - it's set
56:59 - up okay let's see if like this this code
57:02 - already Works
57:05 - maybe my dog just just woke up so yeah
57:09 - I'll beit busy uh all right so I got the
57:12 - window a crap I forgot that I that I
57:14 - unlocked the
57:15 - mouse oh
57:18 - crap okay I didn't think about this how
57:20 - am I going to interact with the window I
57:21 - guess I have to lock the yeah CU like
57:26 - this ah crap okay this was a bit a bit
57:31 - tricky
57:33 - um myg is going nuts because he couldn't
57:35 - hear yours
57:42 - really uh okay so now I got to fix this
57:46 - okay so now this an interesting question
57:48 - so somebody was asking me how do I do
57:50 - research well this is part of the
57:51 - research process which is I want to do
57:53 - an error detector window I want want the
57:54 - window to be Dragon Ball So now how do I
57:56 - Implement drag ball if my demo already
57:59 - has a player that moves around so yeah
58:02 - unlock the mouse while that window is
58:03 - open yeah I think that's what I might
58:05 - end up doing even though I wouldn't
58:07 - really do that in a final game just
58:08 - because that would be really frustrating
58:09 - for the player but yeah I guess in the
58:12 - final game I would maybe do some kind of
58:14 - like Escape menu and on the Escape that
58:16 - actually brings up clears up the mouse
58:21 - H but yeah that is actually uh all right
58:25 - but just for demo cuz I really just want
58:27 - to get this where's my player where's my
58:30 - player
58:31 - capsule a crap now I don't remember how
58:33 - I set this up it's the first person
58:39 - controller so is this the one that sets
58:41 - the
58:49 - cursor
58:51 - uh was it the player interact
58:55 - because now I don't know where am I
58:57 - setting that
59:02 - oh make a tutorial showcase how you
59:04 - manage scene hierarchy like how you
59:06 - organize that stuff honestly when it
59:08 - comes to that I do something pretty
59:09 - basic like this is it so as you can see
59:13 - I don't really have a hierarchy this is
59:16 - the project for my game than you Gardens
59:18 - and as you can see I really just got
59:20 - separate scenes these are all completely
59:21 - separate I don't normally use additive
59:24 - scene loading
59:27 - uh so yeah pretty much just got a Lobby
59:29 - scene I've got a main menu scene so I've
59:31 - got all of these that get loaded pretty
59:33 - much just one by one so I don't really
59:35 - do much in terms of uh scene hierarchy
59:38 - I've got my character creator my
59:39 - character select my game scene and so on
59:41 - so yep although uh working on the
59:45 - learning more about additive scene
59:46 - loading that is definitely something
59:47 - that I would like to research just
59:49 - because it's something that I know a lot
59:51 - of people use but personally I've never
59:52 - really used it so but yeah in my case I
59:55 - don't normally do anything complex when
59:58 - it comes to that just do super basic
60:01 - keeping
60:03 - any uh right so let me just cuz I need
60:07 - to be able where did I where did I set
60:09 - the cursor. loock state equals lock
60:13 - mode. none let me just find the
60:16 - reference where on Earth am i setting
60:21 - this am I using the player character
60:23 - control
60:26 - maybe no because I unlocked it on
60:29 - the oh am I only putting it
60:32 - on all
60:35 - right or maybe it's this
60:37 - one ah crap cuz now I'm using this
60:41 - controller and I don't
60:43 - remember thank you for your work oh
60:45 - thanks for being here do you use Version
60:47 - Control not really for me my that is
60:49 - probably my most controversial opinion I
60:51 - guess the other day I post on post on
60:54 - rdit about okay so it does work okay
60:56 - that's all I wanted to see just as this
60:58 - works and yeah uh but yeah the other day
61:01 - like a few weeks ago there was a post on
61:03 - Reddit and I talked about my personal
61:04 - experience which is I really just create
61:06 - simple backups I don't really use any
61:09 - versional Control software just because
61:11 - personally doesn't really not something
61:13 - that I really need in my own personal
61:15 - workflow but yeah apparently a lot of
61:17 - people were really upset that I that I
61:19 - said no I mean I would never tell you to
61:22 - not use it no Version Control I mean if
61:25 - you like using it absolutely use it go
61:27 - ahead and use it just personally for me
61:29 - for my for my for my use case for the
61:32 - way that I work no I just use super
61:34 - basic backups like literally just take
61:36 - the entire project folder make it into a
61:38 - a RAR file and I just back that up that
61:41 - is simply it yeah it is a sort of
61:43 - Version Control just a very janky very
61:45 - basic one but yeah if you like using
61:47 - software I I definitely would not advise
61:50 - against it no by all means keep using it
61:52 - just personally yeah I don't really
61:55 - don't really use myself get help save my
61:56 - ass a few times all right so that means
61:58 - that it's definitely worth it so yeah
62:00 - definitely go ahead and keep using um
62:03 - okay so I just wanted to see if the
62:05 - moving the thing works so I really just
62:07 - got to figure out some way to disable
62:09 - the camera whilst the window shows up
62:11 - but anyways yep the window track does
62:13 - work which again a while ago I was
62:15 - talking about reusing code and this is
62:17 - yet another example of that so this is a
62:19 - video tutorial that I made I don't know
62:23 - window drag what did I call it no not
62:26 - that what did I call it drag
62:28 - Windows drag drag window there you go so
62:31 - I made this one in 2019 I made the code
62:34 - for this video and now I just reuse it
62:35 - in another tutorial so if you want to
62:38 - know how to drag UI Windows there you
62:41 - go so much freedom in trying out things
62:44 - without potentially breaking stuff
62:45 - that's true I mean I guess for me I
62:47 - don't necessarily need that I don't know
62:50 - it's just something that I definitely
62:52 - understand people who like using it
62:54 - absolutely and I do get that but I don't
62:56 - know my mindset is always if I try
62:58 - something then I want to get back to it
63:00 - then I'm pretty much just going to
63:01 - delete the code that I wrote and just
63:03 - get back to it so I guess I enjoy
63:05 - writing code so I enjoy the
63:06 - manual but yeah I definitely know that a
63:09 - lot of people prefer using tools and if
63:11 - you do by all means don't let me
63:12 - discourage
63:15 - you is it possible to make the window
63:17 - resizable absolutely you really just
63:19 - need well I guess you would use pretty
63:21 - much the same code as this meaning find
63:23 - out where the where the thing is
63:26 - clicking yes the developer I imagine
63:28 - that is yeah if you're already used to
63:30 - it then yeah it's uh simpler to keep
63:32 - using it uh so in terms of resizing you
63:35 - do pretty much exactly the same thing so
63:37 - instead of tracking clicks on a bar you
63:39 - would track clicks just on the edge and
63:41 - instead of moving the rec transform you
63:43 - would simply modify the transform scale
63:45 - so on the window you would really just
63:47 - modify over there the width and height
63:50 - maybe the position as well something
63:51 - like that anyways okay so this one does
63:56 - work with see your lives yeah thanks for
63:58 - being here I definitely would like to
64:00 - make live streams more regular so let's
64:03 - see if I can actually do that although
64:06 - yeah I got to say I I really don't get
64:08 - it how how people can doing live streams
64:10 - for 7 hours I mean I've been for 1 hour
64:14 - now and my voice already completely
64:15 - messed up so I really have no idea how
64:18 - on Earth can people do that but
64:20 - apparently I don't know apparently most
64:23 - people can do it without issues they can
64:25 - do well most people people who stream on
64:27 - like twitch like Len she TW she streams
64:31 - on Twitch every single day constantly
64:32 - for several hours and apparently her
64:35 - voice is fine so 15-hour live stream
64:37 - Jesus that is insane that is crazy oh
64:41 - man check Avatar missions on the web oh
64:44 - did I not add it I thought I did
64:48 - but yeah I definitely got to got to
64:50 - update the website thing theye show more
64:53 - yeah I think that might be part of the
64:54 - issue is when I do a live stream I don't
64:57 - know I feel like if there's silence on
64:58 - the live stream that's kind of like my
65:00 - fault that's my problem so I try to talk
65:02 - as much as possible which means that in
65:04 - one hour of live stream I talk more over
65:06 - here than I do I don't know in an entire
65:09 - week of just living my own life so that
65:11 - is probably why just probably very
65:13 - intense for a very short period of time
65:15 - and my voice really gets messed up water
65:19 - Apple yeah I drink tons of water but it
65:21 - doesn't seem to work uh like I drink
65:24 - water nonstop but yeah it still gets
65:27 - quite a bit messed up okay so I just
65:29 - want to try out the tool tip canvas how
65:31 - do I try this one
65:33 - out um let me go into the player
65:37 - interact okay let's say when I interact
65:39 - with something let's go into the tool
65:41 - tip was it tool tip Canvas OR screen
65:46 - space cuz I'm pretty sure that I made
65:48 - multiple tool tips but now I don't
65:53 - remember
65:55 - okay now I don't remember but yeah I
65:56 - think this is the screen space canvas I
65:59 - like tea personally yeah I'm definitely
66:00 - that's only something that I need to try
66:02 - T and honey yeah how to relax The Voice
66:06 - what is your stream schedule I don't
66:08 - really have one I stream when I got
66:10 - something that I would like to do and I
66:11 - might as well do it on live stream but
66:13 - yeah definitely something that I would
66:14 - like
66:15 - to start doing a bit more regularly but
66:19 - that's kind of tricky since I work on so
66:21 - many things at the same time like one
66:22 - day I'm working on tutorials another day
66:24 - I'm working on some special project
66:25 - another day I'm updating my game another
66:27 - day I'm just doing research so yeah my
66:29 - life is very chaotic I do very different
66:32 - things every single day so that makes it
66:34 - hard to define a schedule for pretty
66:36 - much
66:37 - everything anxious coding live yeah that
66:41 - can definitely be concerning I Remember
66:44 - by now I think I'm pretty good at that
66:46 - at not panicking when something in the
66:48 - code goes wrong hey there you go there's
66:50 - my tool tip but yeah I remember doing a
66:52 - live stream like I don't know like two
66:54 - years ago one of the first ones that I
66:55 - made and I was doing something and the
66:57 - code wasn't
66:58 - working and it was quite stressful how I
67:00 - was live stream with a camera pointing
67:02 - at me and I was secretly having like a
67:04 - mini panic attack because the code
67:05 - wasn't working it wasn't so yeah that
67:07 - was definitely yeah writing code live is
67:10 - definitely a bit stressful although
67:12 - thankfully I think nowadays I'm a bit
67:14 - better at that but yeah that is
67:15 - definitely a challenge okay so that
67:17 - worked let me just increase the scale
67:19 - just make it a little bit more visible
67:21 - for the video oh T oh oh okay she
67:28 - P okay anyways
67:33 - right code not working is very normal oh
67:36 - yeah absolutely but the difference is
67:38 - that whilst I'm working just by myself
67:40 - that is a normal part of the process but
67:42 - if it's not working whilst I don't know
67:45 - 250 people are staring at me that is
67:48 - quite a bit more
67:50 - stressful okay so for this Demoine that
67:52 - should be good so the air detect factor
67:54 - I should be able
67:55 - to uh work with this a little bit and
67:58 - then record the video let me just
68:00 - see oh right the urp decals that is the
68:03 - other
68:04 - one so yeah for this project I don't
68:07 - think the shark the character
68:09 - customization I did that one okay so
68:10 - it's see localization and urp decals
68:13 - these are the two ones that I still need
68:15 - to prepare what time is it midday 41
68:19 - yeah uh okay so let me actually let me
68:22 - close this project just so my PC doesn't
68:24 - get messed up with like three Unity
68:26 - Windows open at the same
68:29 - time uh now what do I want I want to
68:33 - open
68:33 - up both of these
68:37 - actually okay so let's see if that one
68:40 - do
68:41 - work why you win a stream reward quality
68:44 - stream with great attention to viewers
68:46 - thank you I mean I I do try my best I
68:48 - try to read chat but yeah sometimes it
68:50 - goes so fast that goes through quite a
68:52 - lot of things um how do you handle
68:55 - multiple Sprite based
68:58 - animations uh I haven't really done
69:00 - anything with too many 2D animations in
69:02 - quite some time but usually just using
69:04 - an animator and not using the the
69:07 - transitions usually that is something
69:09 - that really works you Bally just got
69:10 - separate animations each of them are
69:12 - separate Sprite based animations and you
69:15 - just transition instantly instead of
69:17 - having a smooth transition because that
69:18 - doesn't really work with Sprite based
69:19 - animations so you just got an animator
69:22 - with various animator States and you use
69:23 - code instead of the animation instead of
69:25 - the transition system in order to play
69:27 - one animation then play another one and
69:28 - so
69:29 - on what Happ to my avatar oh yeah it
69:32 - does what happened did you change it cuz
69:36 - if you change it then I have to manually
69:39 - validate so let me actually see if
69:41 - anyone made some custom avatars let me
69:45 - just open up that
69:47 - window uh validate player textures I
69:50 - really need to improve this system
69:52 - because takes quite a while in order to
69:55 - validate everything but yeah okay so
69:57 - that is taking a little bit to load and
70:00 - my window has already
70:02 - loaded and do I got uh what is this one
70:06 - this one is the miscellaneous one okay
70:08 - so that one is good thinky Guardians
70:11 - yeah probably don't need but leave that
70:12 - one open Drag windows and so on
70:19 - okay the basic coding is easy but is it
70:22 - hard to learn to more advanced
70:25 - concepts uh uh that's a tricky question
70:29 - just because I mean technically it is
70:30 - harder the advanced concepts are by
70:32 - definition going to be more advanced
70:33 - more complex but at the same time if you
70:36 - start from the basics if you start from
70:38 - the beginner level and you slowly
70:40 - increase difficulty of the things that
70:41 - you're trying to learn then by that
70:43 - point even though the things you're
70:45 - learning are supposedly more complex
70:47 - because you already have the knowledge
70:48 - of all the things before it hopefully
70:50 - that makes the learning C be nice and
70:52 - smooth it always gets supposedly more
70:54 - difficult you're always learning more
70:56 - complex things but hopefully the the
70:59 - learning curve becomes nice and smooth
71:01 - so everything is just slightly a bit
71:03 - more complex so the really the best
71:05 - thing is really just focus on the things
71:07 - that you are doing try to don't try to
71:10 - jump to something insanly Advanced like
71:13 - if you just barely learned about
71:15 - variables and maybe don't learn about I
71:16 - don't know interfaces right now focus on
71:18 - learning the basics and slowly get a bit
71:21 - better bit
71:22 - better
71:24 - uh yeah the more you know the more you
71:26 - know that you don't know that is that is
71:28 - definitely true I mean uh programming
71:31 - game development these are all things
71:32 - that have pretty much an infinite uh
71:37 - amount of learning so yeah the more you
71:39 - know the more you see that there's even
71:41 - more stuff to learn which personally I
71:43 - really like it I really love the idea
71:44 - that I'm going to continue learning Game
71:47 - Dev and programming for the rest of my
71:48 - my life I really enjoy it so I really
71:50 - like the fact that I'm going to continue
71:53 - doing it yeah run stream it's a default
71:55 - one yeah let me see if the if the little
71:58 - thing is updated see if any of these
72:01 - there are any custom characters yep
72:03 - there's one so let me validate
72:08 - that my website is a little bit slow so
72:11 - that is a bit something is there anyone
72:16 - else any
72:18 - more nope uh right so now if I upload
72:22 - the character
72:24 - yeah there you go there's the custom
72:26 - character
72:27 - again like I said all of you if you want
72:30 - you can make your own custom characters
72:32 - you can just download the Sprite and
72:34 - print it and where's my window there it
72:38 - is you can just draw your own custom
72:41 - characters from that link and then just
72:43 - let me know so I can manually validate
72:45 - it so basically it gives you a sprad
72:46 - sheeet like this one and then you can
72:48 - basically just draw inside these squares
72:50 - in order to draw a custom character
72:52 - which is a pretty interesting thing oh
72:55 - boy my voice already messed up all
72:59 - right okay what did I want to do on this
73:02 - one oh yeah it's on the urd counts so
73:06 - this is something that I'm working on
73:08 - update for my ultimate TNT overview
73:10 - course I'm trying
73:12 - to uh work on some lectures some sort of
73:16 - things using some type of compression
73:18 - also uh probably I'm pretty sure that
73:21 - that original Sprite sheet is like
73:23 - a th000 by a th000 whereas over here for
73:26 - the characters they are scaled down by
73:28 - some point so yeah there's definitely
73:29 - some compression the 3D model not really
73:33 - I've learned the basics and that was
73:35 - quite fun which actually by the way if
73:38 - you do want to learn Basics there's
73:40 - actually a nice sale on Humble Bundle
73:42 - right now so if you want to learn from
73:44 - the same place where I learned the
73:46 - blender
73:48 - Basics uh let me get the
73:51 - link there's actually a night oh not
73:53 - this one
73:55 - copy this one there you go so yeah if
73:59 - you want to learn the basics of blender
74:02 - then yeah definitely recommend I'm
74:04 - pretty sure it's this course yeah it's t
74:06 - by by Grant so yeah if you want to learn
74:08 - the Bas of blender I really enjoyed this
74:10 - course it was really nice I think it was
74:12 - like 10 15 hours so it took me quite a
74:14 - while to go through it but yeah I
74:15 - definitely learned quite a lot about
74:18 - modeling it's definitely not my skill
74:20 - set but at least now I know the basics
74:21 - so that helps me actually into interact
74:23 - with other 3D modelist and understand
74:25 - what they're saying so yeah if you want
74:28 - to learn I definitely recommend there's
74:29 - a ton of course here so if you're
74:32 - looking to spend if you're looking to
74:34 - buy something so you can spend the next
74:37 - uh month the month the the holidays
74:40 - doing something learning uh blender uh
74:43 - 3D modeling then I can highly recommend
74:45 - this one okay so on this one what did I
74:48 - want to do with this demo scene uh oh
74:52 - right I just wanted to it was actually
74:54 - not with this one it was the other one
74:55 - so now I have to open up the other
74:58 - project and I want the test 23 because I
75:03 - actually would like to try out Muse
75:05 - texture okay it's opening on the other
75:08 - window all
75:15 - right how to make selection character
75:19 - there's a billion things to do that but
75:21 - I would recommend you looking into my
75:24 - free course because on the uh
75:26 - multiplayer one I do include character
75:30 - selection so if you want to learn how to
75:32 - do that definitely look into that here's
75:35 - the course curriculum and yep there's a
75:37 - character select
75:38 - scene and you can go on
75:42 - YouTube and you can see how to make the
75:45 - character select where you can select
75:47 - from multiple characters and multiple
75:48 - things so yeah if you want the absolute
75:49 - Basics this is pretty much the most
75:51 - basic character select scene although at
75:52 - the same time time once this is basic is
75:55 - actually I was going to say it's the
75:57 - same one that I'm using in my game dinky
75:59 - Guardians and it is true but on that one
76:01 - actually the customization is done
76:03 - before that so it's a bit but yeah if
76:05 - you want to do the most basic things
76:06 - then it is that's a great resource um
76:09 - all right hey that was BL thanks for
76:12 - that he thanks for watching I hope it
76:13 - helped a lot okay so let me put this
76:16 - here and yeah cuz I actually still
76:18 - haven't tried out this so the new
76:21 - material generator so basically I would
76:23 - like to instead of using boring cubes in
76:26 - order to demonstrate over here how the
76:28 - decal projector how this one works I'll
76:31 - put this one on everything yeah even
76:32 - though the character move it off to the
76:35 - sign Yeah so basically I'm going to need
76:38 - some kind of pillar so let me reset that
76:42 - put that just something like
76:46 - this like some kind of pillar but I want
76:48 - it to be a bit more interesting and for
76:51 - that I figured I might as well try using
76:54 - this because I haven't I haven't used
76:55 - this yet how are you doing I'm doing
76:58 - well thank you thanks for being here
77:00 - need to actually complete kitchen chaos
77:02 - things have been so bus definitely take
77:04 - your time when you have time get back to
77:06 - it I mean the course is there forever so
77:08 - definitely don't speed up whatever you
77:10 - do just focus on exual learning so take
77:12 - your time go nice and slow and yeah
77:14 - thank for work thanks for being here
77:15 - thanks uh okay what do I
77:18 - want I'm just put
77:20 - concrete I suck at at thinking of think
77:23 - to
77:24 - do
77:26 - uh that's the thing I'm not an artist so
77:28 - I don't know what is a good looking
77:30 - texture now is this a goodlook concrete
77:32 - texture how do I make something a bit
77:35 - more oh yeah cuz I can use
77:38 - patterns oh so something like this could
77:41 - be fun could be interesting live in
77:44 - portal do you speak Portuguese yep see I
77:47 - was born here so yep even though I've
77:50 - been uh learning English since I was
77:53 - like 10 years old so yeah by now English
77:55 - is pretty much it's almost more natural
77:57 - to me right now than than than
78:00 - Portuguese if you're playing texture on
78:02 - default Cube make sure to adjust it oh
78:04 - yeah I need to modify the scale yeah cuz
78:07 - I scale that Cube so yeah that is going
78:08 - to be a little bit like that um let me
78:11 - put concrete but with some
78:14 - shape uh how do I get back to
78:17 - Generations oh that's strange oh
78:20 - so so if I oh it add its refinements on
78:24 - that one all right okay that looks good
78:29 - how do I turn this into a material is it
78:33 - that material preview is it
78:37 - previewing uh okay so that's the preview
78:41 - and the height let me massively
78:44 - increasing that was fun metallic no this
78:48 - should probably not be metallic smooth
78:50 - super smooth no concrete should probably
78:53 - not be smooth so now the main thing is
78:56 - because for my kind of texture Creator
78:58 - is this this is the uh Unity AI Muse
79:01 - thing for generating textures this is
79:03 - the first time that I'm using it so I'm
79:04 - learning as I go
79:06 - along secret part is the free C course
79:09 - that's actually not secret I'm pretty
79:11 - sure I've mentioned that yeah the next
79:12 - thing that I'm working on is a free C
79:14 - course so yeah the secret project is
79:15 - something a bit different but yeah going
79:18 - to be that in a little bit
79:20 - um drag from the com right what is
79:24 - that
79:25 - uh okay so this good how do I get this
79:28 - do I just drag it onto the project is
79:30 - that how it works so let me just oh what
79:33 - is that oh it saves the generations
79:36 - that's interesting uh okay so that save
79:39 - the select Generations onto the
79:42 - project okay so does that actually save
79:45 - or
79:47 - no okay so I'm not entirely sure how do
79:50 - I how do I save this what are these
79:52 - buttons is this oh these are the
79:54 - previews that is why I can't really see
79:59 - them okay so I'm not sure why is this
80:02 - not isn't it supposed it feels like if I
80:04 - click on there save the select
80:06 - Generations into the
80:08 - project you drag the material to the
80:10 - mesh yeah but I don't have a material
80:12 - yet so I can't do I drag it from here on
80:15 - somewhere let me put something here I'll
80:17 - make a 3D make a
80:20 - cube if I drag that one onto that one
80:23 - okay so apparently that do work thank
80:25 - you but that's strange how clicking on
80:26 - this button save Generations this one I
80:30 - would expected to save or maybe it
80:32 - didn't cuz where is this
80:34 - material where is this
80:38 - stored okay so now I'm confused is it a
80:41 - bug or something cuz over here this one
80:44 - doesn't have
80:46 - anything and I click on that one and
80:48 - this material does not exist anywhere is
80:50 - it supposed to exist like inside the
80:53 - other one you have to select the preview
80:55 - and then click on the save button oh
80:59 - okay okay I would say either I'm very
81:02 - dumb or that probably needs a bit of a
81:05 - better
81:06 - workflow cuz yeah if there's nothing
81:08 - selected and I click on it I would
81:10 - assume that it would download this one
81:12 - but apparently no apparently I have to
81:14 - select here then click on it and now it
81:16 - tells me to save on something so
81:18 - concrete material and now finally does
81:20 - save onto something okay so that's good
81:22 - that's what I want
81:23 - let me just okay I can't dock this
81:25 - window somewhere I can
81:31 - nice how to get this AI generated this
81:33 - is Unity Muse which has a if you were
81:36 - part of the beta you should have
81:38 - received an email with a with a coupon
81:40 - for 30 days free otherwise you can do
81:42 - the uh thing so yeah anyways
81:46 - so oh and shows the Muse points 89 I
81:49 - still haven't figured out what the
81:52 - points are s but anyways in beta doesn't
81:54 - matter so not going to worry about that
81:56 - anyways okay so I get my concrete maps
81:59 - and I got the concrete oh it creates all
82:01 - these oh I did not know that's cool I
82:03 - thought it just made the normal Maps hey
82:05 - someone asking does generate and yep it
82:07 - does generate I thought it would just
82:09 - generate the normal map but no
82:10 - apparently generates all of them okay so
82:12 - that's that's useful that's interesting
82:15 - that is
82:18 - interesting so if I put it on
82:21 - there and yeah I mean that does look
82:23 - like concrete I
82:25 - suppose so I guess basically the thing
82:27 - is I want to see if I can put this on
82:29 - another project and I assume I can so if
82:32 - I just show an Explorer I open up these
82:35 - now let me go into the other project
82:37 - which is actually
82:38 - on uh wait this is dinky Gardens not
82:41 - this one this one this one's on the 22
82:43 - LTS so this one technically does not
82:45 - have thing but if I open up on project
82:47 - and I paste it in and there you go got
82:50 - my concrete Maps got my concrete and if
82:52 - I put it on this there and
82:54 - okay oh it's a Shader error I thought it
82:57 - was going to be a urp thing oh
83:01 - no oh crap oh that's annoying yeah it
83:04 - seems to be using a muse Shader oh
83:07 - that's
83:08 - annoying I definitely expected this to
83:12 - work so do I just need to copy the
83:14 - Shader where's this Shader can I save
83:16 - this Shader to a different place cuz
83:18 - yeah if you use a m special Shader does
83:21 - this use anything specific that only
83:22 - works on 23 let me see uh yeah save as
83:27 - let me save it on
83:30 - somewhere that why did that just open a
83:32 - new window I don't
83:35 - know hey congrats on 500k thanks so much
83:38 - thanks for being here I mean the only
83:40 - reason why I hit 500k is because all of
83:41 - you are here so I really hope the videos
83:44 - have helped you thank you all so much
83:45 - for watching them it's always a a fun
83:48 - two-way thing just like the differen
83:50 - Shader uh yeah I guess I could use just
83:52 - a different Shader but I tried copying
83:54 - the Shader will it import or does it
83:57 - have
83:58 - errors let's see it's
84:00 - thinking does it load up does it have
84:03 - any
84:04 - errors apparently has an HD unknown okay
84:07 - I don't know but it might work uh so
84:11 - let's go into the concrete and let's use
84:14 - Shad
84:15 - graphs and Muse material oh it works all
84:19 - right okay so that's cool so I don't
84:21 - know if they intentionally wanted Muse
84:23 - to be exclusive
84:25 - to uh
84:28 - to 23
84:31 - but yeah apparently it's uh yeah it's
84:34 - the T but yeah so apparently you can use
84:37 - Muse on recent version so that's cool
84:41 - all right that's cool so basically I
84:42 - just want to try it out just to have an
84:44 - interesting place to put
84:46 - that but yeah I mean this is what this
84:49 - is what I think is like the best thing
84:51 - for the best use case for Unity AI like
84:54 - you probably wouldn't want to use the
84:56 - generated materials in a final game but
84:57 - for prototyping instead of using just a
84:59 - basic boring great box prototype yeah I
85:02 - think like this it can be quite good so
85:04 - like for example on this demo instead of
85:06 - having the scene like this I can have
85:08 - just this one off to the side let me
85:10 - grab the where's there you go the
85:13 - projector and yep I can project onto
85:15 - that one and yep like this I've got a
85:16 - bit of a more interesting
85:19 - scene all right that's cool so we're
85:22 - right now I'm just uh building up uh
85:25 - demo scene so I can then make some
85:26 - tutorials this one is on the urp decal
85:29 - projector which is an interesting one
85:31 - that I haven't really used Too
85:35 - Much be easier to use the Cindy protape
85:38 - as back sure yeah if you use any of the
85:41 - many material prototype packs that would
85:44 - also work yeah yeah that would
85:47 - definitely also work although I do think
85:49 - that since this is built in directly
85:51 - into Unity
85:52 - I do think this is actually it helps
85:55 - speed up iteration like instead of
85:57 - having to go into the accur in order to
85:58 - pick one of the many tons of free uh
86:01 - textures I really just write something
86:03 - here just use it and just drag it onto
86:06 - the project use it right away so yeah I
86:08 - do think in terms of speeding up
86:10 - iteration I do think this tool can be
86:12 - quite useful so
86:14 - yeah uh okay so D Gardians I don't
86:16 - really need this one anymore so yeah
86:18 - basally I just want to try that out and
86:21 - see so I might as well
86:23 - I don't know I guess my problem is I
86:24 - don't have an artist's mind so I can't
86:26 - even think of
86:29 - something so like what can I generate I
86:32 - don't know what kind of a wood texture
86:36 - tell me things to generate so I can try
86:38 - out this deal and see what it
86:43 - does do what do game objects need
86:47 - collider for the projector to work nope
86:50 - the or I'm pretty sure it doesn't like
86:52 - if I move this col nope yeah it's all
86:55 - cuz this is all just
86:56 - a uh visual rendering depth sort of
87:01 - thing so nope it does not require a
87:02 - cther in order for the decal to
87:06 - hit uh he look that some wood textures
87:09 - and yeah I guess this does look like
87:11 - wood so Mossy dirt Mossy dirt okay let's
87:16 - see that one that one sounds interesting
87:18 - generate a Code Monkey okay I'll try
87:19 - that when I go into the M Sprite hey
87:22 - Mossy D this is this doesn't look quite
87:25 - Mossy so if I edit this and I put it as
87:29 - a material does look like Mossy dirt and
87:32 - let's see on the scene view let me make
87:34 - a 3D
87:36 - plane heyu thanks so much for being here
87:40 - yeah thanks for the live streaming award
87:42 - that was a very unexpected but yeah
87:45 - thank you thank you all so much for
87:47 - voting that's a it's a fun thing coffee
87:49 - time hey thanks so
87:50 - much uh okay so it does seem to work for
87:53 - a Mossy dirt and if I put
87:56 - it oh yeah it looks a little bit low
87:59 - resolution which wouldn't be an issue by
88:01 - modifying the the scale but so I'm
88:04 - pretty sure this has a I put it on 55
88:08 - yep there you go I mean this is
88:09 - definitely save no I don't want to save
88:11 - the shade graph yeah I mean this is
88:14 - definitely Mossy
88:16 - dirt
88:18 - yeah okay so that's uh that's
88:21 - interesting
88:23 - uh but yeah there was a upscaler sort of
88:27 - thing wasn't there great variation setus
88:30 - reference image something
88:33 - something like what Herring bone wood
88:37 - I'm not sure what is hering yeah low
88:39 - poly I guess the issue is that Terrain
88:41 - in low poly low poly usually doesn't
88:45 - really use materials but what did you
88:47 - say hering bone wood I have no idea what
88:50 - that is I assume it's a specific type of
88:55 - wood oh you can upscale is this that
88:58 - wood I mean these all look very specific
89:00 - types of wood so
89:03 - yep how do you up SC was on the drop-
89:05 - down menu was how do I find the previous
89:08 - one which drop down menu this one oh
89:12 - upscale there you
89:14 - go I wonder how much is this upscale
89:17 - like 2K textures maybe oh that does look
89:20 - quite a bit more yeah let me go into
89:22 - material
89:29 - mode it's usually wooden Flor
89:37 - tiles yeah that does seem yeah that does
89:39 - seem more high resolution not sure by
89:42 - how much
89:45 - but yep there it is just need to play
89:49 - around with the
89:50 - scale yeah I mean like I said for basic
89:53 - protypes for quickly generating
89:55 - something I do think this tool can be
89:58 - quite useful I mean just have a player
89:59 - here and boom you got a player character
90:01 - in a nice thing let's actually put this
90:04 - a bit
90:07 - bigger so if I was prototyping a basic
90:12 - firsters player
90:15 - controller maybe 20 yeah I just got to
90:18 - play around with the thing but yeah so
90:22 - like this seems like a basic decent
90:24 - floor texture pretty much yeah and the
90:27 - main thing is really just how
90:29 - it like I said I think this is excellent
90:31 - for pro timing for iteration because
90:33 - it's built directly into the engine so
90:35 - anything I can come up I can add so it's
90:38 - quite interesting AI created Sky boxes
90:40 - oh that would be
90:42 - interesting yeah that would definitely
90:43 - be quite interesting floor is lava does
90:45 - this generate lava let's
90:48 - see let's see
90:50 - oh doesn't look much like lava or does
90:53 - it I actually don't know isn't lava
90:56 - supposed to be a bit more red I guess
90:58 - technically it depends on if it is or
91:01 - not so red
91:04 - lava does it do something it does I mean
91:08 - that's something so that looks like
91:10 - something that you could see in Mount
91:12 - Doom I guess if you has a PBR
91:15 - material try magma okay yeah magma would
91:18 - probably work but this one all seems
91:20 - pretty decent
91:22 - just constantly have to play around with
91:24 - the thing like 20 20 yeah I guess that
91:29 - is lava if I were to add some emission
91:32 - so would probably oh does this not have
91:35 - emission Ah that's annoying isn't it
91:38 - supposed
91:41 - to yeah I guess these materials don't or
91:44 - it's not the materials it's the Shader
91:46 - doesn't seem to have a mission which
91:48 - would be pretty easy to add so that
91:50 - seems like a bit of an emission bit
91:53 - strange but yeah looks like grass but
91:56 - just red yeah I mean if if it had some
91:58 - emission some glow it would look a bit
92:00 - more interesting
92:02 - definitely
92:04 - yeah try putting out
92:06 - style I mean technically the main thing
92:08 - one of the main selling points is how
92:09 - you don't have to constantly add all
92:11 - those parameters like d but yeah I mean
92:14 - by default they should all be table so I
92:16 - don't think needs so but if I make
92:19 - stylized lava texture
92:22 - I don't think this is actually very good
92:23 - for stylized
92:26 - stuff that looks slightly stylized I
92:29 - suppose these all definitely look very
92:33 - different so yeah I'm not sure how this
92:35 - works for specifically stylized stuff
92:38 - but I
92:40 - mean I mean that one actually seems
92:42 - pretty
92:45 - good always having to do that would be
92:48 - nice if this automatically adapted to
92:50 - something
92:55 - yeah I guess that is Source analized
92:56 - although it doesn't really look like
92:58 - like that
92:59 - yeah grass brick okay let's let's try
93:04 - that let's try a grass brick and on
93:08 - shape let's use a pattern so pattern
93:10 - kind of like this one okay let's try to
93:13 - see does do pixel tiles I don't think so
93:16 - I believe this was only trained on you
93:18 - know there's a model selection here
93:20 - Unity texture so I believe they haven't
93:22 - really tried anything with uh like
93:25 - stylizing so I think this is really only
93:27 - good for for
93:30 - um oh God what I want to say realistic
93:33 - yeah this is only good for realistic art
93:35 - styles but yeah grass brick okay these
93:37 - look more like bricks and grass with
93:38 - this one looks pretty interesting it's
93:40 - got a bit of grass but yeah
93:44 - uh oh it's trying to see import the
93:46 - black and white CNY
93:48 - image for getting the color
93:53 - important image like what kind of
93:56 - image you want an image of something I
93:59 - don't know let me pick I don't know like
94:01 - a a cursor hand what kind of image do
94:04 - you
94:05 - want
94:07 - uh cuz yeah wasn't this one supposed to
94:10 - have some kind
94:14 - of
94:16 - H yeah on the demo they showed some way
94:20 - of
94:22 - okay I don't know some way of drawing
94:25 - but how do I actually do that I don't
94:27 - know like if I want to modify like get
94:29 - rid of this part okay maybe that isn't
94:32 - included in this version cuz I'm pretty
94:33 - sure it was over here that they dragged
94:38 - something so yeah I don't
94:40 - know what is this image like is it going
94:44 - to do in the shape of a
94:47 - cursor if I click on so a
94:52 - grassy tile grassy
94:54 - brick and try to generate he going to
94:57 - generate a grip oh oh boy okay that's
95:00 - definitely all
95:02 - right it's in the middle top what is in
95:05 - the Middle top what am I missing drawing
95:06 - is for the Sprite generator yeah the
95:09 - Sprite generator does have that but I'm
95:10 - pretty sure on the texture they generate
95:11 - some textures it had a bunch of strange
95:14 - things there's a pen tool on top okay am
95:17 - I blind cuz I don't see it this one no
95:21 - oh this you mean this one no this is the
95:23 - ey dropper tool I don't see any pen
95:27 - tool in the shape no just say pattern
95:30 - just
95:30 - say go back before the hand bug back to
95:34 - what select this one maybe it's in here
95:37 - generation data what is this I would use
95:40 - something
95:42 - something it was there a moment ago
95:45 - okay I don't see any pen
95:50 - anywhere like this one has like a
95:52 - favorite up vote down vote something
95:54 - like that Branch I assume that clears
95:57 - create variations of this one export up
95:59 - scale something like that up what am I
96:02 - oh on the middle okay I guess I'm a
96:04 - little bit dumb all right okay good
96:07 - thanks okay yeah definitely uh okay so
96:11 - let me mask out this part and say this
96:13 - one is supposed to have but let's say
96:16 - lava so like got a brick with some mask
96:19 - with some lava let's see if that does
96:21 - does oh crap did you went back
96:25 - to okay it seems like it generated them
96:27 - but didn't really add any
96:31 - lava all
96:33 - right maybe that's a bit too
96:37 - strange
96:39 - uh B ring so red
96:47 - brick okay so it's not generating
96:50 - anything in red
96:52 - it is generating that part so it is
96:53 - working with the mask but apparently it
96:55 - isn't reading the
96:58 - prompt
96:59 - okay so I don't know if I'm missing
97:02 - something I don't think I am so I think
97:03 - this just I don't know General bugs
97:05 - things red moss covered brick so if I
97:08 - mask out mask out this area let's also
97:10 - mask out this area right
97:12 - here uh red moss covered
97:16 - brick and
97:18 - generate let's see what it does hey hey
97:21 - sh you thanks so much another Super Chat
97:23 - cute thank you Sun Val oh hey hey nice
97:27 - thanks for being here by the way you're
97:29 - new course on making a farming game
97:31 - looks really interesting so yeah great
97:32 - job on that does look quite interesting
97:35 - nice uh okay so yeah this one does seem
97:39 - to be broken maybe the negative prompt
97:41 - okay maybe they swapped it out
97:42 - accidentally just on the mask although
97:45 - it seems strange I mean at least the
97:46 - mask is inde the drawing a mask but yeah
97:49 - there's definitely something broken here
97:52 - because yeah look at that it is a bit
97:55 - the colors got a bit strange so like the
97:58 - negative seems to have kind of worked
98:01 - cuz the colors changed a little
98:03 - bit yeah yeah I assume it's a little bit
98:06 - broken since it's still on the Early
98:09 - Access I'll definitely make sure
98:11 - to uh I'm pretty sure I enable the VOD
98:14 - on this live stream so I'll definitely
98:15 - send over the VOD for this live stream
98:17 - to the uni team so they can see the
98:19 - issues that I had with the with the UI
98:22 - and with the thing sparkling symmetrical
98:25 - okay that's a very let me actually copy
98:27 - that cuz I don't know if I can write
98:28 - that that sounds
98:29 - interesting okay let's try that and
98:32 - patterns no patterns just like that a
98:36 - kaleidoscopic
98:37 - mosaic okay I mean it does look
98:40 - very although isn't kaleidoscopic
98:43 - supposed to have a bunch of colors
98:45 - sparkling
98:47 - colorful and something with a bunch more
98:50 - colors
98:52 - right yeah I mean this looks like a nice
98:54 - Mosaic this one as well that almost
98:57 - looks like a match three sort of
98:59 - background sort of
99:00 - thing
99:02 - huh let me upscale this and see what it
99:06 - does do you have the animation bot nope
99:09 - I need to yeah cuz that one is like okay
99:12 - it doesn't seem like that actually
99:13 - upscaled anything seems like it's
99:14 - literally the same image so probably
99:17 - another bug even though that one says 2K
99:19 - but I'm pretty sure my eyes are not
99:21 - deceiving me I'm pretty sure these are
99:22 - two exactly the same images so yeah D
99:26 - seems to be much higher quality yeah
99:28 - definitely that is why like I said I
99:30 - really think the the strong point for
99:32 - these tools are just for super quick
99:33 - interation super quick prototyping and
99:35 - not really for anything that you would
99:37 - use in a final game I think in order to
99:40 - get to that level it still needs quite a
99:44 - lot I mean but it does work it does
99:47 - generate
99:49 - something and if if I go and I increase
99:52 - the
99:54 - tiling and yeah I mean that's a mosaic
99:57 - so kind of looks like a strange bathroom
99:59 - of sorts but yeah that is a that's a
100:02 - background so you could put this on a
100:03 - wall yeah I guess I guess technically
100:06 - works let me see the the the other did I
100:10 - also install the other one I did the
100:11 - Sprite generator so I haven't looked
100:14 - into this one at all so let me actually
100:16 - close out that one so someone was asking
100:19 - so let's say codee monkey and see what
100:21 - does this generate let's
100:32 - see remove background this is one part
100:34 - that I think is
100:36 - inappropriate okay I don't know what's
100:38 - inappropriate about okay that is
100:42 - defin that's definitely very rough but
100:47 - yeah oh boy that's funny what is
100:51 - inappropriate about a Code
100:53 - [Laughter]
100:57 - Monkey oh wow yeah this definitely did
101:00 - not go
101:01 - [Laughter]
101:03 - well yeah I guess the Sprite tool needs
101:05 - to be for more things that you can that
101:08 - you can probably imagine because yeah
101:10 - that definitely does not look like any I
101:12 - mean that looks like a monkey I have no
101:14 - idea why code apparently means a pink
101:16 - shirt I'm not sure and apparently code
101:20 - monkey and lead you a lot of
101:22 - inappropriate content okay all right but
101:24 - yeah I mean these are monkeys so if I
101:25 - wanted the monkey Sprite I guess that
101:27 - would work
101:30 - uh so if I just write code what is going
101:32 - to
101:34 - generate where is secret project all
101:36 - right yeah I want to do that before I go
101:42 - so yeah
101:45 - uh how is code
101:48 - inappropriate and what is this I don't
101:50 - know I mean they the one they did on the
101:53 - live stream so a chicken T-Rex let's see
101:56 - what that generates pink shirt just in
101:58 - valid sh oh hey ha how's it going yeah I
102:01 - assume so I mean apparently it reads
102:04 - code and it thought Shader error I don't
102:08 - I don't
102:10 - know okay so those are chickens although
102:12 - don't really look like much of a T-Rex I
102:14 - mean this one looks sort of the beak
102:17 - looks right in pixel art I don't think
102:19 - this does pixel art
102:26 - on the awards hey thank you so much
102:28 - thanks sure it's appropriate to watch
102:30 - this broadcast yeah I don't know
102:33 - apparently something about that is
102:35 - inappro okay there's
102:36 - definitely there's definitely something
102:39 - going wrong with this to because
102:41 - apparently chicken T-Rex pixel art
102:43 - Apparently that is somehow inappropriate
102:45 - content yeah there's
102:47 - definitely definitely some rough things
102:49 - to be worked out on this one but yeah
102:54 - yeah definitely clearly still a few bugs
102:57 - clearly very much an early access
102:59 - release oh but hey I mean that does look
103:01 - pixelated I thought it would do it but
103:03 - apparently the pixel art does work so
103:07 - that part Works uh but yeah I think this
103:09 - was made primarily for like realistic
103:12 - stuff so if I do like a sword that one
103:14 - hopefully should be able
103:16 - to generate some kind of
103:19 - sword
103:23 - on adding game pable items uh Unity has
103:25 - some really great uh sample scenes on
103:28 - that I don't remember where they are
103:30 - though but yeah on the package manager
103:34 - they do
103:35 - have like the uh what do you call it a
103:38 - battle pass Unity battle pass sample I'm
103:42 - pretty sure they've got a sample on a
103:45 - battle pass which has a bunch of those
103:47 - yeah they've got a complete sample so if
103:49 - you're looking for that that kind of
103:51 - stuff I would definitely point you to
103:52 - their official samples which should
103:54 - hopefully help guide you in the right
103:56 - direction but I mean yeah I guess this
103:58 - does look like a sword uh so then what
104:01 - would
104:02 - I generation data no oh yeah I would do
104:05 - an export export sword.png
104:09 - and where's my where's my
104:11 - project where's my project and yep over
104:14 - here I mean this is indeed a sword
104:17 - Sprite I mean I think the best thing
104:19 - about this tool is the removal of the
104:21 - background that is something that
104:22 - usually has to be done very manually in
104:24 - all of the other AI generators so like I
104:27 - said I really think this to is really
104:29 - good
104:30 - for um for the prototyping stage like
104:33 - you need a sword there you go super
104:34 - basic sword you would probably end up
104:36 - replacing it with something else but
104:39 - yeah for something that you generate
104:41 - very quickly Yep this is definitely a
104:43 - sword but yeah definitely a lot of I
104:46 - don't know what is inappropriate about
104:48 - the the prompts that I use but
104:50 - apparently the tool did not like
104:53 - that uh try a tree yeah let's do a tree
104:58 - and see if it does a styliz tree or a
105:01 - realistic
105:04 - tree and then try out like a
105:07 - character or character by part something
105:10 - like
105:11 - that yeah I mean that's a that's a tree
105:14 - like this one looks pretty interesting I
105:16 - mean it's got the Flor whether you want
105:18 - it or not but yeah
105:21 - works better for things that are easy to
105:22 - find yeah I guess that's it which is
105:24 - kind of interesting because in theory
105:25 - like the goal of generative AI is
105:28 - generating things that are completely
105:30 - random those are usually the examples
105:32 - they give but yeah I guess this two
105:33 - would be better for things that are more
105:35 - normal rather than yeah rather than
105:38 - something that is very very unique very
105:41 - different but yeah and if I write a
105:43 - character what is it going to do I'm
105:46 - playing around with this and I have no
105:48 - idea the points okay apparently I just
105:50 - spent a th000 points I don't know yeah
105:53 - the points that is going to be another
105:55 - thing that is quite a bit tricky but
105:57 - hopefully they improve that over time
105:59 - okay yeah these definitely look quite
106:03 - rough say if you want to draw a tree or
106:07 - a sword that seems to work good like a
106:09 - coin so like for basic things that most
106:14 - most uh basic things that most games
106:18 - use it's probably going to be pretty
106:20 - good but anything more yeah keran might
106:22 - need more details given yeah
106:24 - definitely okay those are actually some
106:26 - very rough coins I definitely would
106:28 - expected to generate some like like a
106:30 - super basic gold coin so these are
106:33 - definitely quite a little bit
106:36 - rough we can use this as it on Steam
106:39 - technically yes because they said that
106:42 - they own all of their inputs so
106:44 - technically that does mean that you
106:45 - should own the the outputs for all this
106:49 - so technically that should not have
106:51 - issues although nobody ever knows what
106:53 - seam is actually going to do so that is
106:55 - quite tricky but yeah I mean this is a
106:57 - coin so if I were to create a2d object
107:00 - oh did I not install the Sprite package
107:02 - I didn't so let me just make a2d image
107:05 - instead to the image with a coin and put
107:09 - a coin and yeah there you go I mean
107:10 - that's a coin so yeah where is my canvas
107:14 - oh it's on the corner there all right
107:17 - yeah yeah so technically oh crap so Tech
107:20 - that is indeed a coin okay sure but yeah
107:24 - definitely the tool still needs quite a
107:25 - bit of work definitely very early access
107:28 - so yeah yeah but I'm curious to see how
107:31 - this improves over time with more
107:33 - training with more feedback from people
107:34 - it should hopefully be quite
107:36 - interesting question about multiplayer
107:39 - using Unity username and password so how
107:41 - can I make players search for each
107:44 - other uh you can't by default meaning I
107:48 - don't think Unity has a built-in tool
107:49 - for finding things I mean you can use
107:51 - the lobby and you can make a public
107:53 - Lobby and then automatically find the
107:56 - hey nice that's a fun one uh you can use
107:58 - the lobby service but by default you
108:01 - need some kind of server some kind of
108:02 - thing that has data of all the players
108:04 - that have signed in so I don't think
108:06 - Unity has any built-in thing for that of
108:09 - knowing which users are online at what
108:11 - time at what time so yeah you pretty
108:14 - much need to do something we kind of
108:16 - like have a general game Lobby like as
108:18 - soon as the player starts playing you
108:20 - send some data to a server that says
108:23 - okay this player is now starting to play
108:25 - then show that on the list of things but
108:27 - at the same time you should probably
108:29 - do uh I would probably just use Lobby so
108:32 - for that use case if you haven't seen it
108:36 - my tutorial on Lobby is pretty nice
108:38 - pretty not that one that one it's uh
108:41 - pretty good so I would probably use
108:42 - Lobby for that use case
108:46 - um okay dice again yeah pretty much all
108:49 - of these these are all
108:50 - very very rough but technically that is
108:53 - a dice I mean obviously the dots are
108:55 - very strange this looks very odd very
108:58 - odd but yeah technically for a quick
109:00 - prototype that would definitely be
109:01 - passable as a dice so
109:06 - yeah this looks unusable yeah right now
109:09 - it is definitely very
109:11 - rough uh but yeah curious to see how
109:15 - this to improves over time
109:18 - yeah uh okay what was I doing right so
109:22 - my super secret project which is yeah
109:26 - the
109:29 - uh so basly the secret project is this
109:34 - the question of the day so basically
109:37 - this is if you've been following the
109:38 - channel for quite a while you've
109:40 - probably seen me post a bunch of
109:42 - questions every once in a while on the
109:44 - unity Community tab Unity on the YouTube
109:47 - Community Tab and yeah so basically what
109:49 - I finally managed to do is after a long
109:51 - time I finally managed to work on this
109:52 - which is basically making an automated
109:54 - system so I wrote a bunch of questions
109:56 - and every 3 days I've got an automated
109:58 - thing that post the questions for
110:00 - example this question what is the
110:01 - significance of January 1st 1970 so is
110:04 - the is it the SCM release dat on the
110:06 - magnax Odyssey which by the way cool tip
110:09 - I think that was the very first console
110:11 - thing so yeah or is it the start of Unix
110:13 - time and this case yep I'm pretty sure
110:15 - that one is the start of Unix time and
110:17 - if that is correct that's a nice scen
110:20 - yep which are Unix s samp so if you
110:21 - don't know what is the significance of
110:23 - this date that is pretty much uh a Unix
110:25 - s samp is just an INT counting every
110:27 - second laps and every sing of laps since
110:29 - January 1st 1970 so Unix SS are super
110:33 - useful so basically the the secret
110:35 - feature is I've got I've automated the
110:38 - process of making a bunch of questions
110:40 - uh then I also have it to make automated
110:42 - emails so if you want you just get some
110:44 - nice fun questions in your inbox they
110:47 - get generated every 3 days and then you
110:49 - can try to answer the the question
110:50 - hopefully learn something new and then
110:52 - you can read a lot of detail on the
110:54 - various on the answer in order to
110:56 - understand okay so this one is Rel to
110:57 - Unique s Sams like for example if you
110:59 - don't know how to get a unique s Sams in
111:01 - C you can do it just like this so you
111:03 - can get that I've got a bunch of related
111:05 - videos where I used all kinds of timing
111:07 - logic all kinds of things so
111:10 - yeah basically you're telling scarm was
111:12 - not released 197 no probably not if they
111:14 - did that was definitely that would
111:16 - definitely be the work of a time
111:17 - traveler uh but yeah so I've got a video
111:20 - going more over in detail on this and
111:23 - basically for this system the one thing
111:24 - that I still need is I still need to
111:26 - edit a ton of the questions so I think
111:30 - I've done up until 25 and for the other
111:34 - ones I've got pretty much just an idea
111:37 - so basically this is where I this is my
111:39 - back end for writing the questions so I
111:41 - write a fun question like this one when
111:42 - create a new script you always have to
111:44 - extend modern behavior then the options
111:46 - yes no or only if you want to use that
111:48 - as a component and the answer is
111:49 - obviously see so you only need mon
111:51 - Behavior if you want to use it as a game
111:53 - object
111:54 - component ni making the tutoral about
111:57 - uni RX is that a testing tool or a
112:00 - dependency injection pretty sure I've
112:02 - heard of it uh yeah so anyway so mono
112:04 - behavior is only necessary if you want
112:05 - to have the functions called
112:06 - automatically however it is not
112:08 - absolutely necessary so basally this is
112:10 - the back end where I write the question
112:11 - I write the answers and all the things
112:13 - and then that turns into this page so
112:15 - this is the page that you would see you
112:17 - would see the question you try to answer
112:18 - it and then you see a bunch more details
112:20 - so hopefully it's a nice fun way to
112:23 - learn by answering a bunch of questions
112:25 - and it should be fun on a bunch of
112:27 - topics a bunch of things helpful links
112:30 - to help you learn a little bit so it
112:33 - should be
112:34 - fun what software you use for your
112:37 - website don't really use any software I
112:39 - mean for me my web dep skills are super
112:42 - basic like literally Bare Bones I pretty
112:44 - much just use the knowledge that I've
112:45 - gained oh crap the knowledge that I've
112:48 - known for
112:50 - about 10 years now so basically just
112:53 - basic HTML basic JavaScript basic PHP
112:57 - which as far as I know nowadays in webd
112:59 - PHP is pretty much I don't know it's
113:01 - supposedly horrible but for my super
113:04 - base use case uh it does work quite well
113:06 - so I quite like the language so it's an
113:09 - interesting one so yeah um yeah so
113:13 - basically I just need to continue so let
113:14 - me see if I can do like question 26 what
113:17 - is this one next place we need WR final
113:25 - text time to go hey bye thanks for being
113:28 - here that's cool PHP is awesome
113:31 - nice
113:33 - uh okay so yeah so basically I've got
113:36 - I've written 25 questions and a bunch of
113:38 - things so yeah I'm going to need
113:41 - to kind of write all of these so I've
113:43 - got a bunch of draft questions so I've
113:45 - got the question got the answers but
113:46 - then the answer is really simple so I've
113:48 - got about 70 of them written so I've
113:50 - still got about 50 of them to really
113:52 - flash out make something a bit more
113:55 - interesting so hopefully this should be
113:56 - a fun way to to learn answer a bunch of
114:00 - questions every few days and yeah this
114:02 - is something that I've wanted to do for
114:04 - quite a long time because I do think
114:05 - that it's a fun way to learn an easy way
114:07 - to
114:08 - learn integrate with GPT for automatic
114:11 - question generation uh probably because
114:13 - I don't think I trust it enough to know
114:15 - that it's accurate so I definitely want
114:17 - to do them manually based on my own
114:18 - knowledge so yeah I definitely want to
114:21 - do them manual but yeah over here like
114:24 - this it's um finally managed to automate
114:26 - this process so it's something that I've
114:28 - wanted to do for a while and yep I've
114:29 - got a video talking about it in more
114:31 - detail before I actually enable all this
114:33 - on the website because right now it's
114:34 - not yet fully enabled but yeah it should
114:37 - be
114:40 - fun what advice would you give to
114:42 - someone who wants to make games on their
114:44 - own meaning how can one learn a lot of
114:45 - things in this field so one can improve
114:48 - the answer is start with the absolute
114:49 - Basics so for me the main thing that I
114:51 - would point you to is to my free 10-hour
114:54 - course I think that is a great one for
114:56 - complete beginners and people who are
114:58 - more intermediate users so I definitely
115:00 - encourage you to start from there and
115:02 - basically just remember that it takes
115:03 - time and focus on actually learning
115:05 - things so slowly learn the basics learn
115:08 - bit by bit and over time you will gain
115:10 - quite a lot of knowledge oh hey TJ hey
115:13 - thanks for being here nice yeah there's
115:15 - always more to learn with un yeah
115:17 - absolutely I mean part of the thing that
115:19 - is really awesome about these uh about
115:21 - these questions is how they are the S
115:25 - thing is automated and song random so of
115:28 - the 70 questions that I've written there
115:30 - are a bunch of them that I don't
115:31 - remember so I will also be receiving
115:33 - these emails and every once in a while
115:35 - also learning or remembering from the
115:37 - things that I that I've known in the
115:39 - past so yeah it's also going to be fun
115:41 - for me since it's such an automated
115:43 - thing as opposed to being manually
115:44 - manually me picking everything so yeah
115:47 - should be
115:48 - funing y get appreciated in the future
115:51 - nope I mean IM am GUI is still is still
115:54 - uh workable in the editor
115:58 - so so yep nope the UI I would say don't
116:03 - worry about it being deprecated if
116:05 - anything people are going to complain
116:06 - that Unity now has three UI systems
116:09 - because they don't like to deprecate
116:11 - things so yeah it's going to be pretty
116:12 - much like
116:13 - that thinking about jumping to the VR
116:16 - space yeah that is definitely one of
116:18 - those areas that I would love to would
116:20 - love to learn so yeah it's one of those
116:23 - things that's been on my to-do list for
116:25 - ages and yeah it's always hard to find
116:29 - the time I mean when I was at unite I
116:31 - did see a talk about uh it was
116:34 - specifically from meta about their Quest
116:36 - three and specially about mixed reality
116:38 - about the pass through and does seem
116:39 - quite interesting and they do have quite
116:41 - a lot of quite a lot of new what do they
116:44 - call it like blocks like templates so
116:46 - like you want to get just a pass through
116:48 - working you literally just just drag a
116:50 - template and automatically sets up all
116:51 - the scripts all the things so yeah that
116:53 - is definitely one area that I very much
116:54 - would like to get into just need to find
116:57 - the time that is always always my issue
117:01 - be life support for animations is a big
117:03 - issue on uiit yeah that's that's the
117:05 - thing that I've heard that making
117:07 - animations is still not possible not
117:09 - doable so that is why I haven't really
117:10 - gotten into UI toet just yet because it
117:13 - still seems quite a bit underbaked how
117:16 - would you handle RTS resources in
117:18 - multiplayer uh I would handle it the
117:20 - same as anything else so pretty much
117:21 - only the host handles the resources only
117:24 - the host actually has like the resource
117:26 - manager thing only the host handles the
117:28 - totals and all the clients they ask the
117:31 - host okay do we have resources to spend
117:32 - this if so yes or no so yeah pretty much
117:35 - the same thing as on my on my
117:37 - multiplayer game on the free multiplayer
117:40 - course over here I also did um the
117:44 - recipes the recipes these are also the
117:46 - way they are generated and the way they
117:48 - are spawned randomly these are all only
117:50 - happening on the host so the host is the
117:51 - one that manages all of that choosing
117:53 - all the recipes which one to spawn so
117:56 - yep for an RTS this is only the same
117:57 - thing that I would do only the host
117:59 - manages what resource actually
118:01 - exist have conflict multiple clients no
118:04 - because all the clients they don't store
118:06 - any resource they just ask the host okay
118:08 - do we have enough wood to place this and
118:10 - then the host tells you yes we do and
118:12 - the host actually place the wood and so
118:14 - on so you wouldn't have multiple
118:16 - resource managers you would have just
118:17 - one on the host the client simply ask
118:19 - the host can we build this or
118:22 - not want to learn programming patterns
118:24 - from you that's actually something that
118:25 - I've wanted to do for a while is making
118:27 - a course just based on programming
118:28 - patterns I think that would be quite fun
118:31 - so one of the many things on my tun list
118:34 - if I can eventually get to it then that
118:36 - should be fun plans for gdau courses or
118:38 - tutorials not really I mean just uh
118:42 - Unity is really the thing where is all
118:43 - my knowledge so the reason why I have
118:45 - this channel teaching is because I have
118:47 - 10 years of experience making games with
118:48 - unity so if I went to a different engine
118:51 - it would take me quite a long time in
118:52 - order to get comfortable enough with the
118:55 - engine in order to feel like I can
118:56 - actually teach the people so yep pretty
118:59 - much planning to
119:01 - yeah what Happ to your Discord server I
119:04 - just couldn't keep up with it that's
119:05 - that's pretty much a simple answer I
119:07 - mean I'm already so busy trying to
119:08 - answer all the comments every single day
119:10 - trying to
119:11 - answer uh all of the emails all the
119:13 - course questions and so on so yeah
119:15 - trying to keep up with Discord which
119:17 - specifically is a real time time thing
119:20 - that was very very tricky
119:22 - so so yeah that is why I couldn't really
119:26 - make it we have tutorial on these guys
119:28 - walking around I do I do on the end of
119:31 - this page if you go to the bottom of
119:33 - that
119:35 - page over here are the tutorials for how
119:37 - I made this oh boy my voice is really
119:38 - messed up so I really really got to
119:43 - go so if you're curious how I made this
119:46 - this whole thing down here this is a
119:47 - transparent TNT window for the character
119:49 - these are using mesh based animations
119:51 - for interacting with YouTube API that is
119:53 - a simple HTTP request and for the
119:56 - characters how they are randomly
119:57 - generating these are the exact same code
119:58 - that I use in my game battle Tycoon so
120:00 - yep if you want to learn how I made this
120:02 - that is pretty much
120:05 - it okay game programming patterns yeah
120:08 - I've heard great things about that book
120:09 - I really need to get it but yeah I've
120:11 - definitely heard that recommendation
120:13 - quite a while so yeah I definitely would
120:14 - love to because honestly my issue is
120:16 - since I never went to college I don't
120:17 - really have a
120:20 - uh what do you call it like an official
120:22 - knowledge of patterns like I know how to
120:24 - write code I know how to use various
120:25 - patterns but if you tell me if you ask
120:27 - me what specific pattern am I using here
120:29 - I probably couldn't tell you I probably
120:31 - couldn't tell you what
120:33 - is like the factory pattern I know that
120:36 - involves a factory that constructs an
120:37 - object something like that but yeah I
120:40 - definitely have an an issue with finding
120:44 - the names that people use to refer to
120:45 - things so yeah I would love to read that
120:48 - book in order to
120:49 - basically assign names to all the
120:51 - knowledge that I already have I think
120:52 - that would be quite fun so I would love
120:54 - to love to be able to do
120:57 - that okay so I think that's going to be
121:00 - it because my voice is really already
121:01 - messed up like I said I have no idea how
121:04 - on Earth do people do 12-hour live
121:05 - streams this seems really impossible oh
121:09 - man I'm really messed up anyways okay so
121:13 - yeah thank you all so much for joining
121:14 - me I hope this was interesting
121:16 - educational entertaining I hope so I
121:19 - definitely would love to do these more
121:21 - often if I can find a way to set up some
121:23 - kind of schedule but yeah anyway it was
121:25 - fun I did manage to do a bit of work so
121:28 - preparing for a lot of future tutorials
121:30 - a lot of future things so got a lot of
121:33 - work to do a lot of things to do but
121:34 - yeah thank you all so much for being
121:37 - here and yeah let me just set this up
121:40 - put up the background and pick up OB
121:43 - Edge and yep all right okay so yeah
121:47 - thank you all so much for being here
121:49 - here I hope you found it interesting so
121:51 - yep thanks so much for watching and I'll
121:52 - see you next time bye everyone thanks

Cleaned transcript:

oh hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here nice okay now I have to say this stream is a bit off to a rocky start because for some reason Unity just randomly it seems like their license server is down so the goal is to do a bit of work but now I can't open Unity so there's some issue with the license server so yeah I have to say this kind of screws up my plans so let's see if this gets fixed or not so that's definitely bad timing since such a thing has never happened to me before so yeah that's a bit tricky uh but yeah let's see all right yeah definitely a a tricky start but hey everyone hey thanks for being here let's see if I can manage to figure out something but yeah uh just take out the background uh right cuz yeah if I can't open Unity that is going to make this a little bit tricky which I guess by the way now is a good time to ask all of you so are you having the same issue or is it just me uh you just opened a project okay so is it just me cuz basically this is what I'm seeing enable to refresh license try again then I try again and nope nothing happened so yeah that's uh person 500k thank you thank you so much uh so yeah is it just me are you all able to open up Unity right now cuz yeah I just opened up the unity Hub and apparently there's some issue with the license server L out and try again uh okay let's see if that does work cuz basically this is always signed in but it seems like it can't really all right let's see okay it signs in automatically and it signed in but nope still says enable to refresh license let me let me read chat no issue here open the project a while ago okay so that's very strange never had such a thing works fine for me oh come on so it's just a me issue literally on the only time that I decide to do a live stream okay so that's that's tricky okay so have to say this definitely quite a bit of uh Hey from edisa hey nice thank you thanks for being here uh okay so let's see if I can figure this out cuz yeah being unable to open Unity kind of makes a little bit of a tricky thing okay so yeah very very strange okay so I found a temporary fix maybe is it loading okay so I just tried uh activating a personal license and apparently that works so very strange but okay sure I mean right now I don't really need Pro anyway or actually I would like to try out Muse I would like to try it out a little bit there are some tutorials where I could use some nice material so I'd like to try it out but yeah it's like when your manager comes over and everything spits in your face yeah that seems to be the case I mean this has never happened to me so uh yeah very strange let's see if it's currently un loading let's see if this does open all right so yeah sorry for a rough start to the live stream trying to figure this out but okay okay so apparently it is working so I had to grab a personal license so that is very strange because I'm pretty sure my Pro license was at the end but anyways doesn't matter so it should be good all right okay so I can finally do a little bit of work and let's see if everything else goes okay yeah I'm not even quite looking at all the windows since everything got messed up so let me just okay let me actually prepare things cuz now it does seem to be correct so okay let me just do uh all right okay so this should be good so basically I'm going to prepare some upcoming tutorials uh I got to prepare the demo scene so that then I can record the actual proper tutorial so that's basically what I'm going to try to be doing whil trying to reach out trying to do all kinds of things so let's see a cnth acid pack and want to do a flash on the 3D object when it gets damaged what is the easiest way to do that if I'm not an artist to make artwork for it I mean to make a flash you really just need some some emission so like for example I actually I actually need to drag a character here so let me actually uh I'm going to pick up one from these one from these so basic character and I just need to update the thing because apparently I didn't so let me go into rendering to the converter and yep built into urp material upgrade usize and convert okay so that should work uh yeah so basically the easiest way to add some damage kind of thing that would be some kind of material emission like for example let's see this hat what is the kind of material let me make a material with emission so just up here create a brand new material let me go into the hat and drag the material onto the hat and on this one I can go and enable submission put the emission un like white or red I guess if you want to get hit that would be in red uh just increase emission increase the intensity and just need to make sure that I've got towards my processing volume My volume just make sure to make the volume quite intense okay I disabled the special effects and there you go so yeah basically if you wanted the easiest way to do that you really don't need to do any art sort of thing so you can just use a simple emission and just play around the intensity so as the player gets hit really increase it and then slowly bring it down so animated through some kind of interpolation so I've got a nice quick video on smooth with lurp so that's pretty much what I would do just lurp it increase the emission and decrease it and it's a really nice flash effect super easy to do so just increase boom and goes down so yep back to normal so yep that's pretty much what I would do something pretty simple use any framework for dep pendency injection nope not really I've heard great things about zenject and I've seen some videos on it but nope never really use it myself it's a it's a really interesting thing and I do try to make it so that my my code technically could be uh could work with some dependency injection so I use tons of interface tons of stuff but nope never actually use it so yeah won't that overr right the default texture uh yep if you have a glow it is going to work on top of the texture but that's pretty much what you want so if the base map is of a different color so if this one is supposed to be green then yeah that is going to look a bit strange but as goes down and you disable the emission then then goes back to normal so pretty much enable go up then go down when go down disable and so on but yeah that is the easiest way to do that congrats on 500k can we make custom gravity for different players in the same scene in 2D uh I don't think you uh can you do that I actually haven't used Tod physics in in quite a while but if I make just a basic Circle and I add a origin body 2D doesn't this one yeah this one does have a gravity scale so yep you can definitely have one with a gravity scale of something so let's put this one where's my camera cuz everything is far away where's the camera looking at okay it's looking at the other side so yep so yeah you can modify the gravity scale on that one just make this quite a bit smaller just make it two put oh great now it's not visible all right let's put in nice Cas your nice red and this one on the side now this one put it on one and now they should fall at different rates I mean two directions of gravity okay so that nope gravity always falls down on the Y I don't think you can change that so if that's the kind of thing that you need for a game then I would say the best answer is really just handle the gravity yourself so don't rely on the rigid body handling the gravity if you want you can still use a rigid body just make it so that it's kinematic so that you actually move it yourself and you basically implement the the gravity using some math yourself that that would pretty much be it so really just have a vector and then have the gravity Vector point to whatever Direction you want it to be and yeah you basically just need to handle it yourself because I don't think that is natively supported okay uh right active Ron can be triggered to set up that is actually something that I've been wanting to research for quite some time active ragon they are always quite interesting let me just unpack this prefab just so that I don't break the original uh yep so let put the character so Vis I'm going to need the character looking at did I modify yeah I did modify the intensity that is way too intense let me just move the camera a little bit where's my camera I put a player control but I don't need a player control on this one I just need a static camera so basically over here I'm preparing for a uh oh crap that is way too much for a tutorial on how to do character customization pretty much like I did in my game dinky Guardians that is pretty much the goal so Bas only going to have the character and then to the side of it there's going to be a menu in order to customize the thing so basically over here I'm preparing the scene which I will then use in the in the in the tutorial and so on I know if you're looking to go or have already looked into it nope I've I've seen a bunch of GDC talks talking about it it seems like in AAA development GOP is really used if if you don't know what is GOP that means I always forget go go something action oriented oh crap I for or action planning I always forget what the acronym means but yeah it's a it's a very interesting way of doing like behaviors and things so yeah I've definitely seen it being used in a ton of GDC talks I'm pretty sure I saw a bunch of those for Watch Dogs yeah goal oriented action planning yeah that's the one uh yeah so it is really interesting but nope I've never used it myself but yeah definitely something that I would like to research in the future because it's definitely an interesting way to handle behaviors uh okay so in order to prepare for tutal basically I'm going to need the character and the way that this character customization Works actually super simple because all based just on meshes so the way this one works so like it has a backpack and the way this asset pack is set up it's pretty much just modify the mesh just modify the mesh and that modifies all the customization so basically all it takes is really just a simple menu with a bunch of buttons for those buttons in order to modify things so yeah let me also make did I import the UI nope now you're a Unity guy curious how long you spent in in real or any other game engine uh the answer is nothing I think I've opened in real like once or twice but no never really I mean pretty much when I transition from Flash and I wanted to make some PC games that's when I started looking into engine where's my package manager oh there it is uh when I started looking into uh PC games back then uh I looked at my options and pretty much the only valid option was just Unity so yeah that was pretty much that's pretty much how I select back in 2012 I was looking for an engine that could make games and that was free Unity was the only option so yeah I picked unity and since then I continue using it just because I already know how to work with it and it does everything that I wanted to do so yeah because that nope I've never really explored other engines it's always one of those things where if I had infinite time I'd love to I'd love to spend some time in order to actually learn and see what they do different what they do better what does unity do worse what could Unity improve and things like that I think that's very very important very useful to be able to compare with the competition as it were and try to see what they do better and what you could do better but yeah as always my issue it's always the same so I can never find the time so it's always quite tricky the 3. lurp what we use for the third parameter if you want it interpolation uh linear interpolation then you use basally a number that increases from 0 to one YouTube's not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming is the stream lagging what is going on oh it was probably just CU it was updating G Pro anyways uh so yeah on lurp you can either use just an interpolation if you wanted to use the value from 0 to one or alternatively you can modify the original which I'm pretty sure is what I did in this video where I really like how I use lurp which technically it should be used it should be used well the main goal is to be used let me just mute it the main goal is to make it uh linear interpolation but way that I use it basically I use the transform that position as the first value which means that the distance between the start and the end value that distance is constantly getting smaller so by using that essentially makes us kind of smooth so it kind of moves quickly and then slows down as it reaches a point and yep so so yeah for the third time for third value usually I just use the time on time multiplied by some speed and yeah lurp is one of those things that is super useful like you've got two positions and then you can smoothly interpolate between them and I think I personally think that this one the uh ease in ease out I think this is ease out yeah because starts off fast and then goes slow yeah I think this is the one that is super useful so yep that is pretty much how I do it should I you stop down engine for my new game I mean that depends if you're making something that is top down then yeah the top down engine I'm pretty sure I've used it I haven't made a full review on it but I've used it quite a little bit and yep it does seem quite capable so yeah if you want to make something in top down top down shooter or something like that then yeah that can definitely help you speed up and get it to a really nice prototype really quickly all right so here I just need need the I'm just importing some UI assets just make oh hey custom character hey nice Game Dev JJ hey nice by the way if you'd like to make your own custom character you can do it so you can go on to the website you can draw on your own mesh and draw your character and make it exactly anything you want just let me know when it is because needs a manual approval process come out for tning lping with only a single call uh yeah you pretty much need kind of a SN or code routine or in my case I use my function upat class which has where's my where's my code my visual studio uh yeah basically I just got a super useful class in my utilities that I've used tons and tons of time which is pretty much okay let me just import this a crap everything is uh where's my's my window yeah I got to say my PC does become quite a bit slower as that's actually interesting am I streaming at 60 FPS that maybe why maybe why it's a little bit I should probably change that can I change it on the Fly no I don't think so cuz yeah I should probably not be streaming 60 FPS seems like that's a bit unnecessary but anyway sure so yeah just a little bit uh yeah what was I saying I've got my function updator is it still it's still loading my function up dat class which is my utilities if you like to use it go ahead feel free to use it and this one is super useful to me because basically it just creates an object which takes an action and then just runs that action on every update so this is super easy to use like what is the script I don't know but yeah so basically I just go into function updator and I create a new function updator then inside I pass any kind of thing run this every update so for example transform. position equals Vector 3. lurp and I would lurp not left lurp lurp from this transform. position to a Target position of some kind time do time multiply by some kind of speed so then it Flo for the speed 10f and a vector three for me Target position and this would be a new Vector 3 on 0 0 0 something like that and yeah so basically this is what I would do and this would be just one line of code and then the function updator that One automatically constructs a game object it automatically attaches a mon behavior and pretty much just would run this constantly and then I've got a second optional parameter not the function name but there's one for the yeah for my update Funk instead of receiving there's one for just action just runs this constantly on every single update NonStop and then there's another one that takes a funk which returns a bullion which basically when that one returns true that is when that one actually destroys the underlying object so basically what I would do is do this then just return a vector 3. distance distance between the transform out position and the target position and if that distance is within 01 F then basically that would destroy this h and stop running that code so yep basically if you want to do it in just one line personally I use my function of data class this is so useful I'm pretty sure I made this when did I make this in the hyperight days hyperight days I guess which was quite a long time ago when did I launch that game s power.com when did I launch that game uh hyper knights was that in 2016 uh 2017 okay so yeah basically there's a lot of the code that I basically this this game this was the sort of the first game since since I really started learning about writing clean code about making making code that is nice reusable super usable intens of projects so yeah pretty much the code base that I made on this I'm pretty sure most of the utilities I made back when I made this game which was back in 2017 and nowadays yep uh the code that I use in this game I still use it nowadays so that is super useful something that I wrote literally 17 that was what 6 years ago something that I wrote six years ago and nowadays it is still super useful a lot of the code that I use here a lot of the code in my utilities I'm still using in my own game Dy gardiens which I just launched so yeah it's kind of funny when you've got tons of tons of tons of code that you can then reuse and help you through the course of tons of projects oh hey the steam Awards that's fun uh right okay so what was I doing okay this fin no it did not okay I forgot to click on import so just doing something get let me read chat cuz I'm a a little bit little bit oh wow 245 people wow that's insane I got to say when I think about numbers about anything that I do on this channel and something it's always insane like my mind cannot picture 250 people but apparently there are 250 people watching this so thanks for being here yeah that's a it's quite crazy which of course if I complete the whole Unity pathway created with code I've actually never done that I've heard great things about that unity and learn course but never done it uh if I complete that then overcook and turn based will sh my skills provide solid foundation yep I would say that's an excellent path I mean I haven't done the C with code but I've heard great things about it so yeah if you start with that one and then go through my kitchen chaos course that will definitely take it to like intermediate level and then if you take the turnbased strategy course that will then take you into a more advanced level so yep if you follow that if you follow those three then yep by the end you will have quite a lot of knowledge r on un Awards oh thank you uh they actually said they that they made some physical Awards wordss that they were going to send out so I'm very curious to see what that looks like that is going to be funny pen spinning I already tried but it's difficult yeah uh yeah doing this is pretty much the only trick that I know I started learning pen spinning back when I was I don't know when I was like 12 years old when I was a kid and I found a website called px. comom I don't even remember where I saw the videos but yeah that was something crazy and yeah I really I really got hooked into it for quite well I learned a ton of Tricks but yeah nowadays I pretty much just know the infinity and the thumb BR so just the absolute Basics I don't know anything else yeah see you shouldn't stream in 6 oh hey L Mania hey thanks for being here nice uh I really like to look in 60 FPS yeah I really like it for for videos but as I'm trying to do some work that is actually slowing down my Unity by quite a bit so yeah doing it 60 FPS right now that's a it's a bit tricky can't even intiate an object after in the same code to control its position and rotation not sure what you mean I mean if you call intiate you can do ineni and pass in some kind of game object prefab you can entiate with a prefab and then you've got this version with the original and the parent but then you also got this version so you can bring it Vector 3.0 to spawn it on the zero and then qu. identity to spawn with no rotation so yep you can definitely spawn a prefab and position it right away although personally normally I do like transform for the spawn transform something like this so This should actually be a transform for the prefab transform so I usually spawn a transform I don't do anything then I go into this one that position equals new Vector 3 put it down one two three something like that then rotate and so on so personally I normally do it in two lines but if you want it then definitely you can do it in just one line hey Paloma hey thanks for ring here nice wave do you too thanks uh is animating UI would animator bad practice not really so can you please make on UI twinning yeah usually for the UI you do want usually people mostly animate the eyi with tning but you can definitely do it with animations as well uh like for example that is what I use in my game okay I'm going to try to open another un thing and apparently my My Cloud is my Unity license is still messed up but I'm going to try to open another Unity project and hope nothing breaks uh but yeah pretty much you you can definitely use just animations and I did use just animations in my game but so yeah you can use both for some reason usually the convention is in the UI people like to interpolate a little bit more but yeah you can definitely use just regular animations okay let me just make a little canvas make it in World space or why I want it in World space no I think screen space that is probably a bit easier plans for NS tutorial yep I've been re researching dots for the past few weeks and uh yep definitely want to make another one but at the same time I'm working on tons of things at the same time so I'm already super busy for the next week but yeah I wanted to do it before the end of this of this month but it might be early next month but yep definitely interested in getting back into dots uh actually yeah cuz I'm I'm trying to think how I'm going to organize the UI or rather how to organize the the tutorial itself why light mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh let me just scale with screen size 1920 by 1080 scale with a height and yep cuz this seemed quite a bit higher uh all right inside let me put not inside this one put inside put an image and yeah I wanted to make it look similar to my game that one is still opening so I assume the stream is a little bit slow right now since I'm trying to open another project at the same time personally I do dark mode in all I can yeah I know a lot of people prefer dark mode but yeah for me it doesn't I don't know why my eyes are broken I don't know but yeah for me it really does not work looking at something uh looking at White letters in a dark background for some reason my eyes cannot focus they get all messed up very quickly so yep for me it simply does not work okay so here's my that crap here's my game and someone was talking about uh let me load up the other one where's my where's my scenes my scenes let me go inside my game scene and inside the game scene a while ago people were asking about 2D animations where's my where's my UI why is my UI missing where did I put it is because it's where's my UI okay my UI just suddenly vanished why did you vanish where is my canvas 3D okay it's behind all that that's the issue with the with the yeah okay yeah uh so basically on all of these this is how I handle my UI this is the canvas 3D so this is the 3D y that has that sort of nice little thing and for example over here for the grab machine the itom grab machine inside I've got a container and Yep this one is using a regular animat game object so an animator I've got a simple animator just literally just a single animation just a window popup and on this one if I inspect the animation and yep that's what it does so it just moves up and has a nice little squish just to make it a little bit more satisfying but yep it's a regular animation component so every time that I inspect something that is pretty much what what happened so yeah basically to answer that question about can you use the animated in UI absolutely you can so it's really personal preference if you want you can do it based on where's the continue button if you want you can use it based on interpolation but if you also want to do it is this muted cuz I don't want to mess up the the thing uh but yeah so if you want you can make it based on animations oh that's a cool character uh or you can just make them like this so this is a regular animation so just as I inspect and there you go it comes up looks really nice and satisfying all right okay dzui yeah I've definitely heard good things about that I've seen a ton of great reviews on the EST I've actually never used one of those really complex UI Frameworks I know there are a bunch of them and they all seem to have very positive reviews but I've never actually use them so that's that's definely something that I would love to try out to see exactly what they do will you ever create a multiplayer FPS tutorial uh sure if I had infinite time I definitely would that's always my problem I mean I wish I could make a complete 20hour course on every single genre imaginable so making an RTS making a multiplayer FPS making a survival crafting game even making something like Flappy Bird or PacMan just the basics I'd love to be able to make like 20 30 courses but each course takes like I don't know two three months to make so basically for me to build all the ideas that I already have in my head that would already take me like five years So eventually over time I would love to be able to have a ton of content on pretty much every single genre imaginable but yeah it's definitely going to take quite a bit of work to to get to that point that's going to be quite tricky I'm using your multiplayer game as a template for mine it's incredibly helpful oh that's awesome that's cool hey best of luck with the game yeah multiplayer is tricky so yeah I really hope it helps nice what's difference between making a timer in update versus co routine versus async uh I mean in terms of the final goal those are pretty much all the same meaning those are all timers those all do things you can do it on update with a flow timer that is usually the thing that I prefer that is usually the simplest way just have a FL timer count it down when it's in laps do something pretty simple code routines I don't really like them because of the pattern they force you to use like you are forced to use a game object with a mon of behavior then you are also forced to uh return a numerator you've got to make yield returns and all kinds of things so personally I don't like all that pattern that Co routines Force but it it is valid it does achieve the same final result so yeah and async that is uh also another valid option that one is just something that I haven't really gotten used to ASN is still I don't know it's a little bit strange it's a little bit confusing although likely the unity packages a bunch of them have been have been um they've been using async white so because of that I've had to learn it and nowadays so quite a bit more more interesting uh I definitely find it quite a bit easier to understand now that I've spent some time working with those packages so yep asyn wa that is also another valid so pretty much all three of those those are all options really just choose the one that best serves you needs the one that you best prefer for me I really like simple float timer so so yep that's pretty much it love this chat template nice thanks uh yeah this is a a fun overlay just want to tell Code Monkey how helpful is oh that's awesome thank you so much and if you want to know how I made this overlay I covered a bunch of tutorials where I did this so if you want to go to the end of that page and you can definitely do it so this is a transparent Unity window all these characters these are all using mesh based animations in order to interact with YouTube API that's just a simple HTTP request and the characters these are actually a while ago I was talking about how I've reused tons of code from previous games and over here I'm using a bunch of code and art from previous game so these characters down here if you've played my game battle round Tycoon you won't recognize these characters these are pretty much exactly the same so if I search for Battle Royale Tycoon and there's my game oh yeah there's the seam sale I totally forgot it was discount anyways uh yeah so you can look at the characters down here yep they definitely match these characters so yeah that's another awesome thing when you make tons of projects tons of things you build up a library of lots of things that you can then use over time so yep all these Sprites that I drew this game was in like 2018 so I drew these Sprites back in 2018 that was like 5 years ago and now when I made this nice little overlay I was able to reuse the Sprites reuse the animation code and so on so yeah that is why I always talk about so much when it comes to uh writing good clean code and code reusability it's because it is this important like when you do something uh you can then reuse it and save a ton of time do you have a secret project uh yeah that's uh something that I've been working on which yeah i' like to do in a little bit but first I just like to to get this one working so I just need okay what did I want let me just try to do little bit nice have a nice day hey you too uh okay so basically I just want okay where's my let me go into the to the other scene that's the Character Creator scene let me go inside and over here why is it in Portuguese I don't know uh but yeah so inside let's go I basically just want to reference this just to be able to find so the frame table Navy let's just find this one here just to make the demo scene for tutorial similar uh oh crap how am I going to move this okay down there let me just move where's my I don't know where's my where's my scene let me just uh over here just put in there and yeah so basally for the character customization I really just need oh right I need the I need an idle animation so I'm going to have to do that what is the character pack you are using the one over here in the demo I'm actually going to talk about that in the oh crap oh right I removed it uh yeah this one I'm going to talk about in the in the video but yeah if you want to know it has a strange name it's called character 7 uh and yep it's this one so basically this is the pack that I'm using this pack that I'm going to be using in that tutorial which okay I don't know if I can say if it's spoiler alert or not but I've been told this one is going to be on sale so definitely don't buy it right now definitely stay tuned for for the for the future I hope I don't get in trouble for saying that uh but yeah it's uh so I'm trying to make the video in order to to come out next week and the video will come will come out when the thing is on sale so that if you're interested in following along or in just downloading the thing then you can do it Network object pulling yeah that would be an interesting topic uh but more interesting topic is we're only just doing things about uh client side did I not move this did I not move the object oh never mind I'm looking at the wrong project uh yep so basically looking into client side prediction that is the main thing that I very much would like to very much would like to work on okay let me just fix the helmet and then let me try doing the other scene and then I'm going to oh crap what material should I be using this one so let me just copy this one choose the helmet and put it not this one this the hair it's not the hair where's the helmet which one is the helmet this is not the helmet oh crap I can select it it's not this one okay it's this one okay so it's the hat that was the helmet NGO plus addressables is an interesting topic that is interesting how to load things dynamically that sounds complex but yeah definitely definitely interesting which games do you play in your free time uh lately I haven't really had any free time I mean I made that really interesting video on the uh on all the mechanics in uh Assassin Creed Mirage I really enjoyed making this I definitely want to make more of this but yeah so basically I played like 4 hours in order to be able to make this video and since then I still haven't gotone back to it I really would like to so yeah definitely lately I haven't really had much time to play some games but definitely would like to PR 500k thank you okay so let me just quickly try doing the other scenes on this one okay right I keep forgetting what I'm doing uh over here I really just want to add a simple uh animator do I have an idol animation this project I probably do Crouch I don't want to crouch an idol oh that's see Kevin's back very useful okay let's see if this has a regular animator long usually does it take to make a simple game uh that really depends on your definition of simple and also on your own skill set I mean if you're making something like Flappy Bird that's pretty simple so why isn't oh cuz I forgot to assign the Avatar uh yeah so for making something like doesn't this have an avatar this doesn't have an avatar uh if you're making something like Flappy Bird and you're very experienced like I'm pretty sure I could make a Flappy Bird colog in under an hour something like that so yeah that can definitely be done but yeah if you're a beginner I don't know something like FL bird would take like two weeks maybe I don't know it's been it's been a long time since I was a beginner and more than that it's been a back when I was beginner there weren't as many resources so yeah nowadays with all the resources with all the things hopefully it should be relatively easy in order to uh in order to be able to learn and do things doesn't this do I have to okay now I'm a bit confused I don't remember I thought this one came with an avatar premade didn't it let me go into my player visual just seeing hey Super Chat thanks so much I can't get past four views any tips oh boy uh YouTube is really extremely difficult so yeah I don't know that depends on what what topic you're going for are you going for tutorials cuz tutorials are indeed extremely difficult uh okay so I need to make the Avatar uh yeah making tutorials that is extremely difficult let just go make this humanoid from this one so yeah if you're making tutorials then yeah it is really difficult to get views I mean the best thing the the best tip that I can give you which is also a really difficult tip is simply focus on titles and thumbnails it's it might sound odd but on YouTube that's pretty much that's pretty much how it goes I mean the titles and thumbnails are the most important thing if you don't get a good title in a good thumbnail then it doesn't really matter just how good the video is so yeah it kind of sucks to say but that's how that's how YouTube goes I mean the content is obviously very important I mean after people click on the title and thumbnail they have to be able to want to stick in so so the video has to be good enough to keep them engag but before before the the quality of the video itself is important before that comes the title and thumbnail because if people don't even click then it doesn't really matter how good the the video actually is which is kind of the same thing as on scam if you don't have a good title a good hook if people never actually buy your game then doesn't really matter if the game is extremely good or not because if people never click on it then it doesn't really matter so yeah the best tip that I can give you study a lot about titles and thumbnails like if you want to uh study up on YouTube research like I high recommend col and Samir the the podcast really awesome podcast with very uh very successful people on YouTube so that is really great from learning from how people do uh they also got the Creator support that's the name yeah create support another excellent podcast by the same people they talk about YouTube so if you want to learn about YouTube strategy I highly recommend you go research because yeah there's quite a lot to learn I mean steam is really difficult for finding success with Indie Games but YouTube is just as difficult or maybe even more difficult so yeah definitely something that you have to really learn and at the end of day it also takes time I mean right now this channel is on a really nice uh really nice size I mean I just recently hit 500,000 subscribers so yep like I said thank you all so much that is an awesome thing but yeah keep in mind that it took me 5 years to get to this point so yeah even if you do everything right at some point it just takes time so hopefully that answer helped uh okay so totally forgot I keep forgetting getting what I'm doing okay so I just want to apply the basic character Avatar just get this one with an idle animation and then yep there you go ID anation pretty basic pretty simple okay good oh it actually changes that's fun uh all right T me how to use serialized field instead of public oh nice that's awesome that is trly one of the main things if you just learn that just that will massively increase the code quality of your games it will massively decrease amount of bugs that you find so yeah if you just learn one thing from my videos you you learn that if you learn to not make everything public then that is really awesome and if any of you are uh have been here for a short while then you might not have seen yeah pretty much a video on that topic so I highly highly encourage you to watch this video again when you focus about not making everything public when you focus on making things private and only expose them if they need to be exposed if you just follow that that one simple rule that will massively increase the quality of your code and that one thing alone will definitely save you a ton of headaches okay all right so this is so this should be good enough to then make the tutorial now let me see this one the detector this is another one that is really cool which is another it's kind of funny how I was working on my game and now that I made my game I've got tons of videos that I want to do on interesting things that I made in my game and one of them is indeed this one so let me just put this in 2D where's my air detector I saw one there it is the air detector a real nice window although hopefully it's a window that people don't ever see but actually they might they might end up seeing but if they do then it kind of helps to be able to tell basically this pops up whenever the code detects an error so that is something that is really useful so that is also going to be a tutorial that I'm going to be working on I want to purchase a St pathfinding but 50 it's a little too much I have to use Nev mesh yeah I mean if you've got simple use case then Nev mesh works just fine I mean I would say you only need pathf finding you only need that asset if you absolutely need the performance but at the same time I'm pretty sure that one has a a free tier so depending on your use case AAR path finding project I'm pretty sure this one has a free tier so thanks again for the Super Chat I hope my answer helped uh if you go into yeah there's a free version so yeah if you uh can't afford the paid version I would send look into the free version I don't know what this one has what are the limitations but I'm pretty sure it also has multithreading which is kind of like the main thing that I used uh that I used the ASD for so yep definitely try it out and hopefully that should help okay so let me see what did I want to do in this scene which is actually a scene from a tutorial that I already did and that now I want to do a bunch more things things oh boy this is way too sensitive oh crap yeah definitely whoa moving way too much all right so interact with this guy okay why is the text not showing up I'm not sure and why is it okay so I'll have to sort that out see why is the text not showing some kind of oh crap now my mouse is invisible uh use the old UI system or new UI tocket uh I would say right now still stick with unity UI just because UI T kit as far as I know it is still not production ready for uh runtime if you want to make editor tools and absolutely do use that but if you're trying to make uh ingame UI then yep I would say you absolutely okay okay so this one so it seems like I didn't cuz I'm pretty sure that I add a fix to this didn't I yeah chat bomb 3D I thought I did but apparently not because apparently this one needs yeah the hello inverted uh okay let me see where did I the chat bub on 3D so apparently I put this one wrong or maybe I just changed the code afterwards he that's it do shorts help you grow uh technically they should although I haven't really experimented with shorts way too much doing shorts for educational content is really quite tricky so so yeah that is one of those things that I would love to be able to do because yeah apparently they do work quite a lot but oh that's a thing really nice and open the door and yep that's good okay so that's the thing that I want to that I want to try out um yeah always use this un layout or try differ well I mean I Tred tons of un layouts until I found one that works and yep now I pretty much always use this so I've got my scene I've got my game view I got the inspector on the side the project with the console next to it and the hierarchy so yep after much trial and error this is pretty much what I've come to nice see you streaming hey thanks for being here yeah the stream got off to a bit of a rough start I still have to figure out what exactly that issue is but yeah thankfully now it kind of worked got to see my voice is already getting a bit messed up even though it's only been what like 30 minutes how long have I been streaming oh 45 minutes wasn't oh yeah started at 1130 I thought I started at midday yep how do you feel about unit testing as a solo Dev feel it's not really necessary although it might be beneficial for teams yep that's that's pretty much how I feel about it I mean I do think unit testing is really awesome really cool and I definitely try to write my code so that it could be testable but at the same time yeah for a Sol Dev I pretty much I have to write code NonStop and yeah pretty much just don't have time to actually write unit test so in my case I try to write code as clean as possible I try to write code as if I was going to make tests so I try to keep things nicely decoupled but yeah I never actually write tests just because I mean I have to be so fast in order to be able to make games in a short enough amount of time so that the games are successful so yeah I never really have time to do unit tests but but yeah I would say if you're a solo Dev at least write code that should be testable and if you are on a team then yeah at that point writing unit test could probably be uh very important so yep uh what was I saying oh right I was trying to talk about this scene just in case you haven't seen this scene this is the NPC interaction system it's one of my favorite tutorials that I've done I really like the demo scene that I've did so yeah and it's another excellent use case of interfaces so that is really awesome oh boy so many messages trying to keep up with the work and answer questions so just one second cuz I just got a okay let me actually uh all right so basically over here I need to this is going to be the demo for the error detector so basically over here I need to trigger a bunch of errors and the first one that I want is over here on the door so I got to remember how exactly did I implement this so I've got a door interactable and on this door interact oh it was the the script that I had open and that I was writing a bunch of random code okay so basically when I interact I talk on the door and over here how do I do this uh okay let's say because if I do this equals null okay that is going to force a n reference or simly if I remove that and I've never actually get the reference that is going to do it but I think it's only going to trigger the error once and I actually need it to trigger constantly so let's see that I don't have time to watch want to thank you for teaching amazing stuff oh that's awesome thanks for the kind words I'm glad the videos have helped you make a tutorial on UI yet yep that is one of the many things on my toal list I very much would like to but yeah finding time is always a tricky thing I've done a bunch of research and look quite interesting and it seems to be going quite well and okay got an error nice that's exactly what I wanted so yeah can you try my first mobile game uh probably not I don't really usually play mobile games so what are box and leather what is wrong with these box and Leathers okay I don't know but apparently a bunch of these box and Leathers oh they got negative that's strange all right anyways um yeah so let me just yeah that's the problem that it caused the error but just once I need to cause the error multiple times so uh okay so how am I going to do this uh basically just want to trigger an error on every single update so that I can then test out that the airor detector is able to ignore errors that had already seen before where the secret project that is a some really interesting questions a really nice system that I've been working on for a while and in a little bit let me just finish this demo and then I'll showcase that super secret project it's actually not that secret but yeah um okay but if I do it like this it's going to um let me do yeah basically just only set it if it's true obviously this would not be production ready code but yep how come you don't release for mobile that's because mobile is a completely different completely separate World in terms of marketing it's a completely different thing it's all about paying for user acquisition all sorts of things mobile is really tricky not to mention of course the input I mean being able to use mouse and keyboard versus touch that is always going to be quite a big change so you can't really just convert the game into Mobile with just one click requires a ton of work and then since I don't know anything about marketing on mobile chances are it wouldn't be successful so yeah that is why I don't really do it although I wouldn't like to go into consolle so I've been researching that potential because that could be useful since the game is already playable on a gamad should be pretty easy to put on a console all right so it is triggering the error multiple times Exel isign intended okay so that's good what were the other errors that I wanted uh oh okay so the other ones I'm going to trigger when there's the all right so yeah that's about it so I just need the dragable window what means production ready code I mean it just means that I I would not do this I mean this is this is very wasteful code why is it checking for is open and then setting the bullion in every update this makes no sense this is just a waste of performance the correct code is the one that was previously which is the one that I taught in the original tutorial which is it only modifies the bullion on the animator just once whenever the whenever the door Chang state so yeah that's pretty much what you do just change the state once instead of constantly changing it every time but for this demo for the air detector I do want the air to spawn constantly so that is why I'm writing this nasty code just to make sure that the air spawns so that I can actually do tutorial for the nice air detector consol is nice but do you require a Unity version from nintend to release on switch uh you do need to have Unity Pro in order to be able to export the consoles and beyond that I uh beyond that you need to make a account with the various Dev uh account things so a Nintendo Dev account a Microsoft Dev account something like that so yeah it does require that but in terms of software in terms of the actual code I don't think it should require much changes but we'll see I mean it's going to be the first time cuz I've never done a console game gam so that is going to be an interesting journey and if I can talk about it that's a problem cuz consoles those are all always behind some heavy ndas so I'm not sure how much of that process I can talk about but once I go through that process I'll see what I can talk about maybe make an interesting video how do you research uh love to do a video on that I'm afraid that would not be a very interesting video because research basically just unload up the documentation and I read through it then I write the script for the for the video then I try it out myself I figur out how to organize things so yeah I don't think it would make for a very good video just to be me right here staring at things so like for example I'm working on the video on the unity localization package so what did I do I mean first of all I've used it myself in my game but then I came here to the official documentation I went through the guides and they've got a nice a quick start guide for this one so just went through this guide in order to see everything that the package can do cuz I didn't use all the features in my Gam so I want to see everything in order to be able to really cover it and basically just I read through this every time that I'm reading through I've got a un window open on the side that I'm constantly trying this out trying to make sure that everything works that I'm also writing the script for the video and so on so yeah basically uh my research process requires a lot of silently reading so I don't think it would make for a very engaging video uh right uh okay so I'm triggering that error then I just need do I got the drag window here oh I do actually I didn't think I did but I do okay so let me just make a dragon ball window does this have a canvas do I got a canvas I do have a canvas and inside oh I've got the player interact you y okay so let me just make just remember how I made that so a window and then I'm pretty sure the window is meant to have something then inside I've got some kind of background and for the background let's put it something like this and then let's make another one for the title background uh make it a bit more gray and for this one okay so let me just make a nice window here so 300 300 put it on the top left corner and put one z0 okay and for the title background put it something like this so yep pretty much EX down like that for the window I'm pretty sure this one is meant to have okay let me actually just a second I'm not reading chat right now I'm trying to figure this out uh so for ttle background let me incur it on the top left corner like this like this okay so now I need to remember how that I may not the drag drop but the drag Windows because I want to make a window that's dragable apparently I need a reference to the canvas and the drag wre transform oh okay so I think this is meant to be on the ton background I think this is how it's set up okay let's see if like this this code already Works maybe my dog just just woke up so yeah I'll beit busy uh all right so I got the window a crap I forgot that I that I unlocked the mouse oh crap okay I didn't think about this how am I going to interact with the window I guess I have to lock the yeah CU like this ah crap okay this was a bit a bit tricky um myg is going nuts because he couldn't hear yours really uh okay so now I got to fix this okay so now this an interesting question so somebody was asking me how do I do research well this is part of the research process which is I want to do an error detector window I want want the window to be Dragon Ball So now how do I Implement drag ball if my demo already has a player that moves around so yeah unlock the mouse while that window is open yeah I think that's what I might end up doing even though I wouldn't really do that in a final game just because that would be really frustrating for the player but yeah I guess in the final game I would maybe do some kind of like Escape menu and on the Escape that actually brings up clears up the mouse H but yeah that is actually uh all right but just for demo cuz I really just want to get this where's my player where's my player capsule a crap now I don't remember how I set this up it's the first person controller so is this the one that sets the cursor uh was it the player interact because now I don't know where am I setting that oh make a tutorial showcase how you manage scene hierarchy like how you organize that stuff honestly when it comes to that I do something pretty basic like this is it so as you can see I don't really have a hierarchy this is the project for my game than you Gardens and as you can see I really just got separate scenes these are all completely separate I don't normally use additive scene loading uh so yeah pretty much just got a Lobby scene I've got a main menu scene so I've got all of these that get loaded pretty much just one by one so I don't really do much in terms of uh scene hierarchy I've got my character creator my character select my game scene and so on so yep although uh working on the learning more about additive scene loading that is definitely something that I would like to research just because it's something that I know a lot of people use but personally I've never really used it so but yeah in my case I don't normally do anything complex when it comes to that just do super basic keeping any uh right so let me just cuz I need to be able where did I where did I set the cursor. loock state equals lock mode. none let me just find the reference where on Earth am i setting this am I using the player character control maybe no because I unlocked it on the oh am I only putting it on all right or maybe it's this one ah crap cuz now I'm using this controller and I don't remember thank you for your work oh thanks for being here do you use Version Control not really for me my that is probably my most controversial opinion I guess the other day I post on post on rdit about okay so it does work okay that's all I wanted to see just as this works and yeah uh but yeah the other day like a few weeks ago there was a post on Reddit and I talked about my personal experience which is I really just create simple backups I don't really use any versional Control software just because personally doesn't really not something that I really need in my own personal workflow but yeah apparently a lot of people were really upset that I that I said no I mean I would never tell you to not use it no Version Control I mean if you like using it absolutely use it go ahead and use it just personally for me for my for my for my use case for the way that I work no I just use super basic backups like literally just take the entire project folder make it into a a RAR file and I just back that up that is simply it yeah it is a sort of Version Control just a very janky very basic one but yeah if you like using software I I definitely would not advise against it no by all means keep using it just personally yeah I don't really don't really use myself get help save my ass a few times all right so that means that it's definitely worth it so yeah definitely go ahead and keep using um okay so I just wanted to see if the moving the thing works so I really just got to figure out some way to disable the camera whilst the window shows up but anyways yep the window track does work which again a while ago I was talking about reusing code and this is yet another example of that so this is a video tutorial that I made I don't know window drag what did I call it no not that what did I call it drag Windows drag drag window there you go so I made this one in 2019 I made the code for this video and now I just reuse it in another tutorial so if you want to know how to drag UI Windows there you go so much freedom in trying out things without potentially breaking stuff that's true I mean I guess for me I don't necessarily need that I don't know it's just something that I definitely understand people who like using it absolutely and I do get that but I don't know my mindset is always if I try something then I want to get back to it then I'm pretty much just going to delete the code that I wrote and just get back to it so I guess I enjoy writing code so I enjoy the manual but yeah I definitely know that a lot of people prefer using tools and if you do by all means don't let me discourage you is it possible to make the window resizable absolutely you really just need well I guess you would use pretty much the same code as this meaning find out where the where the thing is clicking yes the developer I imagine that is yeah if you're already used to it then yeah it's uh simpler to keep using it uh so in terms of resizing you do pretty much exactly the same thing so instead of tracking clicks on a bar you would track clicks just on the edge and instead of moving the rec transform you would simply modify the transform scale so on the window you would really just modify over there the width and height maybe the position as well something like that anyways okay so this one does work with see your lives yeah thanks for being here I definitely would like to make live streams more regular so let's see if I can actually do that although yeah I got to say I I really don't get it how how people can doing live streams for 7 hours I mean I've been for 1 hour now and my voice already completely messed up so I really have no idea how on Earth can people do that but apparently I don't know apparently most people can do it without issues they can do well most people people who stream on like twitch like Len she TW she streams on Twitch every single day constantly for several hours and apparently her voice is fine so 15hour live stream Jesus that is insane that is crazy oh man check Avatar missions on the web oh did I not add it I thought I did but yeah I definitely got to got to update the website thing theye show more yeah I think that might be part of the issue is when I do a live stream I don't know I feel like if there's silence on the live stream that's kind of like my fault that's my problem so I try to talk as much as possible which means that in one hour of live stream I talk more over here than I do I don't know in an entire week of just living my own life so that is probably why just probably very intense for a very short period of time and my voice really gets messed up water Apple yeah I drink tons of water but it doesn't seem to work uh like I drink water nonstop but yeah it still gets quite a bit messed up okay so I just want to try out the tool tip canvas how do I try this one out um let me go into the player interact okay let's say when I interact with something let's go into the tool tip was it tool tip Canvas OR screen space cuz I'm pretty sure that I made multiple tool tips but now I don't remember okay now I don't remember but yeah I think this is the screen space canvas I like tea personally yeah I'm definitely that's only something that I need to try T and honey yeah how to relax The Voice what is your stream schedule I don't really have one I stream when I got something that I would like to do and I might as well do it on live stream but yeah definitely something that I would like to start doing a bit more regularly but that's kind of tricky since I work on so many things at the same time like one day I'm working on tutorials another day I'm working on some special project another day I'm updating my game another day I'm just doing research so yeah my life is very chaotic I do very different things every single day so that makes it hard to define a schedule for pretty much everything anxious coding live yeah that can definitely be concerning I Remember by now I think I'm pretty good at that at not panicking when something in the code goes wrong hey there you go there's my tool tip but yeah I remember doing a live stream like I don't know like two years ago one of the first ones that I made and I was doing something and the code wasn't working and it was quite stressful how I was live stream with a camera pointing at me and I was secretly having like a mini panic attack because the code wasn't working it wasn't so yeah that was definitely yeah writing code live is definitely a bit stressful although thankfully I think nowadays I'm a bit better at that but yeah that is definitely a challenge okay so that worked let me just increase the scale just make it a little bit more visible for the video oh T oh oh okay she P okay anyways right code not working is very normal oh yeah absolutely but the difference is that whilst I'm working just by myself that is a normal part of the process but if it's not working whilst I don't know 250 people are staring at me that is quite a bit more stressful okay so for this Demoine that should be good so the air detect factor I should be able to uh work with this a little bit and then record the video let me just see oh right the urp decals that is the other one so yeah for this project I don't think the shark the character customization I did that one okay so it's see localization and urp decals these are the two ones that I still need to prepare what time is it midday 41 yeah uh okay so let me actually let me close this project just so my PC doesn't get messed up with like three Unity Windows open at the same time uh now what do I want I want to open up both of these actually okay so let's see if that one do work why you win a stream reward quality stream with great attention to viewers thank you I mean I I do try my best I try to read chat but yeah sometimes it goes so fast that goes through quite a lot of things um how do you handle multiple Sprite based animations uh I haven't really done anything with too many 2D animations in quite some time but usually just using an animator and not using the the transitions usually that is something that really works you Bally just got separate animations each of them are separate Sprite based animations and you just transition instantly instead of having a smooth transition because that doesn't really work with Sprite based animations so you just got an animator with various animator States and you use code instead of the animation instead of the transition system in order to play one animation then play another one and so on what Happ to my avatar oh yeah it does what happened did you change it cuz if you change it then I have to manually validate so let me actually see if anyone made some custom avatars let me just open up that window uh validate player textures I really need to improve this system because takes quite a while in order to validate everything but yeah okay so that is taking a little bit to load and my window has already loaded and do I got uh what is this one this one is the miscellaneous one okay so that one is good thinky Guardians yeah probably don't need but leave that one open Drag windows and so on okay the basic coding is easy but is it hard to learn to more advanced concepts uh uh that's a tricky question just because I mean technically it is harder the advanced concepts are by definition going to be more advanced more complex but at the same time if you start from the basics if you start from the beginner level and you slowly increase difficulty of the things that you're trying to learn then by that point even though the things you're learning are supposedly more complex because you already have the knowledge of all the things before it hopefully that makes the learning C be nice and smooth it always gets supposedly more difficult you're always learning more complex things but hopefully the the learning curve becomes nice and smooth so everything is just slightly a bit more complex so the really the best thing is really just focus on the things that you are doing try to don't try to jump to something insanly Advanced like if you just barely learned about variables and maybe don't learn about I don't know interfaces right now focus on learning the basics and slowly get a bit better bit better uh yeah the more you know the more you know that you don't know that is that is definitely true I mean uh programming game development these are all things that have pretty much an infinite uh amount of learning so yeah the more you know the more you see that there's even more stuff to learn which personally I really like it I really love the idea that I'm going to continue learning Game Dev and programming for the rest of my my life I really enjoy it so I really like the fact that I'm going to continue doing it yeah run stream it's a default one yeah let me see if the if the little thing is updated see if any of these there are any custom characters yep there's one so let me validate that my website is a little bit slow so that is a bit something is there anyone else any more nope uh right so now if I upload the character yeah there you go there's the custom character again like I said all of you if you want you can make your own custom characters you can just download the Sprite and print it and where's my window there it is you can just draw your own custom characters from that link and then just let me know so I can manually validate it so basically it gives you a sprad sheeet like this one and then you can basically just draw inside these squares in order to draw a custom character which is a pretty interesting thing oh boy my voice already messed up all right okay what did I want to do on this one oh yeah it's on the urd counts so this is something that I'm working on update for my ultimate TNT overview course I'm trying to uh work on some lectures some sort of things using some type of compression also uh probably I'm pretty sure that that original Sprite sheet is like a th000 by a th000 whereas over here for the characters they are scaled down by some point so yeah there's definitely some compression the 3D model not really I've learned the basics and that was quite fun which actually by the way if you do want to learn Basics there's actually a nice sale on Humble Bundle right now so if you want to learn from the same place where I learned the blender Basics uh let me get the link there's actually a night oh not this one copy this one there you go so yeah if you want to learn the basics of blender then yeah definitely recommend I'm pretty sure it's this course yeah it's t by by Grant so yeah if you want to learn the Bas of blender I really enjoyed this course it was really nice I think it was like 10 15 hours so it took me quite a while to go through it but yeah I definitely learned quite a lot about modeling it's definitely not my skill set but at least now I know the basics so that helps me actually into interact with other 3D modelist and understand what they're saying so yeah if you want to learn I definitely recommend there's a ton of course here so if you're looking to spend if you're looking to buy something so you can spend the next uh month the month the the holidays doing something learning uh blender uh 3D modeling then I can highly recommend this one okay so on this one what did I want to do with this demo scene uh oh right I just wanted to it was actually not with this one it was the other one so now I have to open up the other project and I want the test 23 because I actually would like to try out Muse texture okay it's opening on the other window all right how to make selection character there's a billion things to do that but I would recommend you looking into my free course because on the uh multiplayer one I do include character selection so if you want to learn how to do that definitely look into that here's the course curriculum and yep there's a character select scene and you can go on YouTube and you can see how to make the character select where you can select from multiple characters and multiple things so yeah if you want the absolute Basics this is pretty much the most basic character select scene although at the same time time once this is basic is actually I was going to say it's the same one that I'm using in my game dinky Guardians and it is true but on that one actually the customization is done before that so it's a bit but yeah if you want to do the most basic things then it is that's a great resource um all right hey that was BL thanks for that he thanks for watching I hope it helped a lot okay so let me put this here and yeah cuz I actually still haven't tried out this so the new material generator so basically I would like to instead of using boring cubes in order to demonstrate over here how the decal projector how this one works I'll put this one on everything yeah even though the character move it off to the sign Yeah so basically I'm going to need some kind of pillar so let me reset that put that just something like this like some kind of pillar but I want it to be a bit more interesting and for that I figured I might as well try using this because I haven't I haven't used this yet how are you doing I'm doing well thank you thanks for being here need to actually complete kitchen chaos things have been so bus definitely take your time when you have time get back to it I mean the course is there forever so definitely don't speed up whatever you do just focus on exual learning so take your time go nice and slow and yeah thank for work thanks for being here thanks uh okay what do I want I'm just put concrete I suck at at thinking of think to do uh that's the thing I'm not an artist so I don't know what is a good looking texture now is this a goodlook concrete texture how do I make something a bit more oh yeah cuz I can use patterns oh so something like this could be fun could be interesting live in portal do you speak Portuguese yep see I was born here so yep even though I've been uh learning English since I was like 10 years old so yeah by now English is pretty much it's almost more natural to me right now than than than Portuguese if you're playing texture on default Cube make sure to adjust it oh yeah I need to modify the scale yeah cuz I scale that Cube so yeah that is going to be a little bit like that um let me put concrete but with some shape uh how do I get back to Generations oh that's strange oh so so if I oh it add its refinements on that one all right okay that looks good how do I turn this into a material is it that material preview is it previewing uh okay so that's the preview and the height let me massively increasing that was fun metallic no this should probably not be metallic smooth super smooth no concrete should probably not be smooth so now the main thing is because for my kind of texture Creator is this this is the uh Unity AI Muse thing for generating textures this is the first time that I'm using it so I'm learning as I go along secret part is the free C course that's actually not secret I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that yeah the next thing that I'm working on is a free C course so yeah the secret project is something a bit different but yeah going to be that in a little bit um drag from the com right what is that uh okay so this good how do I get this do I just drag it onto the project is that how it works so let me just oh what is that oh it saves the generations that's interesting uh okay so that save the select Generations onto the project okay so does that actually save or no okay so I'm not entirely sure how do I how do I save this what are these buttons is this oh these are the previews that is why I can't really see them okay so I'm not sure why is this not isn't it supposed it feels like if I click on there save the select Generations into the project you drag the material to the mesh yeah but I don't have a material yet so I can't do I drag it from here on somewhere let me put something here I'll make a 3D make a cube if I drag that one onto that one okay so apparently that do work thank you but that's strange how clicking on this button save Generations this one I would expected to save or maybe it didn't cuz where is this material where is this stored okay so now I'm confused is it a bug or something cuz over here this one doesn't have anything and I click on that one and this material does not exist anywhere is it supposed to exist like inside the other one you have to select the preview and then click on the save button oh okay okay I would say either I'm very dumb or that probably needs a bit of a better workflow cuz yeah if there's nothing selected and I click on it I would assume that it would download this one but apparently no apparently I have to select here then click on it and now it tells me to save on something so concrete material and now finally does save onto something okay so that's good that's what I want let me just okay I can't dock this window somewhere I can nice how to get this AI generated this is Unity Muse which has a if you were part of the beta you should have received an email with a with a coupon for 30 days free otherwise you can do the uh thing so yeah anyways so oh and shows the Muse points 89 I still haven't figured out what the points are s but anyways in beta doesn't matter so not going to worry about that anyways okay so I get my concrete maps and I got the concrete oh it creates all these oh I did not know that's cool I thought it just made the normal Maps hey someone asking does generate and yep it does generate I thought it would just generate the normal map but no apparently generates all of them okay so that's that's useful that's interesting that is interesting so if I put it on there and yeah I mean that does look like concrete I suppose so I guess basically the thing is I want to see if I can put this on another project and I assume I can so if I just show an Explorer I open up these now let me go into the other project which is actually on uh wait this is dinky Gardens not this one this one this one's on the 22 LTS so this one technically does not have thing but if I open up on project and I paste it in and there you go got my concrete Maps got my concrete and if I put it on this there and okay oh it's a Shader error I thought it was going to be a urp thing oh no oh crap oh that's annoying yeah it seems to be using a muse Shader oh that's annoying I definitely expected this to work so do I just need to copy the Shader where's this Shader can I save this Shader to a different place cuz yeah if you use a m special Shader does this use anything specific that only works on 23 let me see uh yeah save as let me save it on somewhere that why did that just open a new window I don't know hey congrats on 500k thanks so much thanks for being here I mean the only reason why I hit 500k is because all of you are here so I really hope the videos have helped you thank you all so much for watching them it's always a a fun twoway thing just like the differen Shader uh yeah I guess I could use just a different Shader but I tried copying the Shader will it import or does it have errors let's see it's thinking does it load up does it have any errors apparently has an HD unknown okay I don't know but it might work uh so let's go into the concrete and let's use Shad graphs and Muse material oh it works all right okay so that's cool so I don't know if they intentionally wanted Muse to be exclusive to uh to 23 but yeah apparently it's uh yeah it's the T but yeah so apparently you can use Muse on recent version so that's cool all right that's cool so basically I just want to try it out just to have an interesting place to put that but yeah I mean this is what this is what I think is like the best thing for the best use case for Unity AI like you probably wouldn't want to use the generated materials in a final game but for prototyping instead of using just a basic boring great box prototype yeah I think like this it can be quite good so like for example on this demo instead of having the scene like this I can have just this one off to the side let me grab the where's there you go the projector and yep I can project onto that one and yep like this I've got a bit of a more interesting scene all right that's cool so we're right now I'm just uh building up uh demo scene so I can then make some tutorials this one is on the urp decal projector which is an interesting one that I haven't really used Too Much be easier to use the Cindy protape as back sure yeah if you use any of the many material prototype packs that would also work yeah yeah that would definitely also work although I do think that since this is built in directly into Unity I do think this is actually it helps speed up iteration like instead of having to go into the accur in order to pick one of the many tons of free uh textures I really just write something here just use it and just drag it onto the project use it right away so yeah I do think in terms of speeding up iteration I do think this tool can be quite useful so yeah uh okay so D Gardians I don't really need this one anymore so yeah basally I just want to try that out and see so I might as well I don't know I guess my problem is I don't have an artist's mind so I can't even think of something so like what can I generate I don't know what kind of a wood texture tell me things to generate so I can try out this deal and see what it does do what do game objects need collider for the projector to work nope the or I'm pretty sure it doesn't like if I move this col nope yeah it's all cuz this is all just a uh visual rendering depth sort of thing so nope it does not require a cther in order for the decal to hit uh he look that some wood textures and yeah I guess this does look like wood so Mossy dirt Mossy dirt okay let's see that one that one sounds interesting generate a Code Monkey okay I'll try that when I go into the M Sprite hey Mossy D this is this doesn't look quite Mossy so if I edit this and I put it as a material does look like Mossy dirt and let's see on the scene view let me make a 3D plane heyu thanks so much for being here yeah thanks for the live streaming award that was a very unexpected but yeah thank you thank you all so much for voting that's a it's a fun thing coffee time hey thanks so much uh okay so it does seem to work for a Mossy dirt and if I put it oh yeah it looks a little bit low resolution which wouldn't be an issue by modifying the the scale but so I'm pretty sure this has a I put it on 55 yep there you go I mean this is definitely save no I don't want to save the shade graph yeah I mean this is definitely Mossy dirt yeah okay so that's uh that's interesting uh but yeah there was a upscaler sort of thing wasn't there great variation setus reference image something something like what Herring bone wood I'm not sure what is hering yeah low poly I guess the issue is that Terrain in low poly low poly usually doesn't really use materials but what did you say hering bone wood I have no idea what that is I assume it's a specific type of wood oh you can upscale is this that wood I mean these all look very specific types of wood so yep how do you up SC was on the drop down menu was how do I find the previous one which drop down menu this one oh upscale there you go I wonder how much is this upscale like 2K textures maybe oh that does look quite a bit more yeah let me go into material mode it's usually wooden Flor tiles yeah that does seem yeah that does seem more high resolution not sure by how much but yep there it is just need to play around with the scale yeah I mean like I said for basic protypes for quickly generating something I do think this tool can be quite useful I mean just have a player here and boom you got a player character in a nice thing let's actually put this a bit bigger so if I was prototyping a basic firsters player controller maybe 20 yeah I just got to play around with the thing but yeah so like this seems like a basic decent floor texture pretty much yeah and the main thing is really just how it like I said I think this is excellent for pro timing for iteration because it's built directly into the engine so anything I can come up I can add so it's quite interesting AI created Sky boxes oh that would be interesting yeah that would definitely be quite interesting floor is lava does this generate lava let's see let's see oh doesn't look much like lava or does it I actually don't know isn't lava supposed to be a bit more red I guess technically it depends on if it is or not so red lava does it do something it does I mean that's something so that looks like something that you could see in Mount Doom I guess if you has a PBR material try magma okay yeah magma would probably work but this one all seems pretty decent just constantly have to play around with the thing like 20 20 yeah I guess that is lava if I were to add some emission so would probably oh does this not have emission Ah that's annoying isn't it supposed to yeah I guess these materials don't or it's not the materials it's the Shader doesn't seem to have a mission which would be pretty easy to add so that seems like a bit of an emission bit strange but yeah looks like grass but just red yeah I mean if if it had some emission some glow it would look a bit more interesting definitely yeah try putting out style I mean technically the main thing one of the main selling points is how you don't have to constantly add all those parameters like d but yeah I mean by default they should all be table so I don't think needs so but if I make stylized lava texture I don't think this is actually very good for stylized stuff that looks slightly stylized I suppose these all definitely look very different so yeah I'm not sure how this works for specifically stylized stuff but I mean I mean that one actually seems pretty good always having to do that would be nice if this automatically adapted to something yeah I guess that is Source analized although it doesn't really look like like that yeah grass brick okay let's let's try that let's try a grass brick and on shape let's use a pattern so pattern kind of like this one okay let's try to see does do pixel tiles I don't think so I believe this was only trained on you know there's a model selection here Unity texture so I believe they haven't really tried anything with uh like stylizing so I think this is really only good for for um oh God what I want to say realistic yeah this is only good for realistic art styles but yeah grass brick okay these look more like bricks and grass with this one looks pretty interesting it's got a bit of grass but yeah uh oh it's trying to see import the black and white CNY image for getting the color important image like what kind of image you want an image of something I don't know let me pick I don't know like a a cursor hand what kind of image do you want uh cuz yeah wasn't this one supposed to have some kind of H yeah on the demo they showed some way of okay I don't know some way of drawing but how do I actually do that I don't know like if I want to modify like get rid of this part okay maybe that isn't included in this version cuz I'm pretty sure it was over here that they dragged something so yeah I don't know what is this image like is it going to do in the shape of a cursor if I click on so a grassy tile grassy brick and try to generate he going to generate a grip oh oh boy okay that's definitely all right it's in the middle top what is in the Middle top what am I missing drawing is for the Sprite generator yeah the Sprite generator does have that but I'm pretty sure on the texture they generate some textures it had a bunch of strange things there's a pen tool on top okay am I blind cuz I don't see it this one no oh this you mean this one no this is the ey dropper tool I don't see any pen tool in the shape no just say pattern just say go back before the hand bug back to what select this one maybe it's in here generation data what is this I would use something something it was there a moment ago okay I don't see any pen anywhere like this one has like a favorite up vote down vote something like that Branch I assume that clears create variations of this one export up scale something like that up what am I oh on the middle okay I guess I'm a little bit dumb all right okay good thanks okay yeah definitely uh okay so let me mask out this part and say this one is supposed to have but let's say lava so like got a brick with some mask with some lava let's see if that does does oh crap did you went back to okay it seems like it generated them but didn't really add any lava all right maybe that's a bit too strange uh B ring so red brick okay so it's not generating anything in red it is generating that part so it is working with the mask but apparently it isn't reading the prompt okay so I don't know if I'm missing something I don't think I am so I think this just I don't know General bugs things red moss covered brick so if I mask out mask out this area let's also mask out this area right here uh red moss covered brick and generate let's see what it does hey hey sh you thanks so much another Super Chat cute thank you Sun Val oh hey hey nice thanks for being here by the way you're new course on making a farming game looks really interesting so yeah great job on that does look quite interesting nice uh okay so yeah this one does seem to be broken maybe the negative prompt okay maybe they swapped it out accidentally just on the mask although it seems strange I mean at least the mask is inde the drawing a mask but yeah there's definitely something broken here because yeah look at that it is a bit the colors got a bit strange so like the negative seems to have kind of worked cuz the colors changed a little bit yeah yeah I assume it's a little bit broken since it's still on the Early Access I'll definitely make sure to uh I'm pretty sure I enable the VOD on this live stream so I'll definitely send over the VOD for this live stream to the uni team so they can see the issues that I had with the with the UI and with the thing sparkling symmetrical okay that's a very let me actually copy that cuz I don't know if I can write that that sounds interesting okay let's try that and patterns no patterns just like that a kaleidoscopic mosaic okay I mean it does look very although isn't kaleidoscopic supposed to have a bunch of colors sparkling colorful and something with a bunch more colors right yeah I mean this looks like a nice Mosaic this one as well that almost looks like a match three sort of background sort of thing huh let me upscale this and see what it does do you have the animation bot nope I need to yeah cuz that one is like okay it doesn't seem like that actually upscaled anything seems like it's literally the same image so probably another bug even though that one says 2K but I'm pretty sure my eyes are not deceiving me I'm pretty sure these are two exactly the same images so yeah D seems to be much higher quality yeah definitely that is why like I said I really think the the strong point for these tools are just for super quick interation super quick prototyping and not really for anything that you would use in a final game I think in order to get to that level it still needs quite a lot I mean but it does work it does generate something and if if I go and I increase the tiling and yeah I mean that's a mosaic so kind of looks like a strange bathroom of sorts but yeah that is a that's a background so you could put this on a wall yeah I guess I guess technically works let me see the the the other did I also install the other one I did the Sprite generator so I haven't looked into this one at all so let me actually close out that one so someone was asking so let's say codee monkey and see what does this generate let's see remove background this is one part that I think is inappropriate okay I don't know what's inappropriate about okay that is defin that's definitely very rough but yeah oh boy that's funny what is inappropriate about a Code [Laughter] Monkey oh wow yeah this definitely did not go [Laughter] well yeah I guess the Sprite tool needs to be for more things that you can that you can probably imagine because yeah that definitely does not look like any I mean that looks like a monkey I have no idea why code apparently means a pink shirt I'm not sure and apparently code monkey and lead you a lot of inappropriate content okay all right but yeah I mean these are monkeys so if I wanted the monkey Sprite I guess that would work uh so if I just write code what is going to generate where is secret project all right yeah I want to do that before I go so yeah uh how is code inappropriate and what is this I don't know I mean they the one they did on the live stream so a chicken TRex let's see what that generates pink shirt just in valid sh oh hey ha how's it going yeah I assume so I mean apparently it reads code and it thought Shader error I don't I don't know okay so those are chickens although don't really look like much of a TRex I mean this one looks sort of the beak looks right in pixel art I don't think this does pixel art on the awards hey thank you so much thanks sure it's appropriate to watch this broadcast yeah I don't know apparently something about that is inappro okay there's definitely there's definitely something going wrong with this to because apparently chicken TRex pixel art Apparently that is somehow inappropriate content yeah there's definitely definitely some rough things to be worked out on this one but yeah yeah definitely clearly still a few bugs clearly very much an early access release oh but hey I mean that does look pixelated I thought it would do it but apparently the pixel art does work so that part Works uh but yeah I think this was made primarily for like realistic stuff so if I do like a sword that one hopefully should be able to generate some kind of sword on adding game pable items uh Unity has some really great uh sample scenes on that I don't remember where they are though but yeah on the package manager they do have like the uh what do you call it a battle pass Unity battle pass sample I'm pretty sure they've got a sample on a battle pass which has a bunch of those yeah they've got a complete sample so if you're looking for that that kind of stuff I would definitely point you to their official samples which should hopefully help guide you in the right direction but I mean yeah I guess this does look like a sword uh so then what would I generation data no oh yeah I would do an export export sword.png and where's my where's my project where's my project and yep over here I mean this is indeed a sword Sprite I mean I think the best thing about this tool is the removal of the background that is something that usually has to be done very manually in all of the other AI generators so like I said I really think this to is really good for um for the prototyping stage like you need a sword there you go super basic sword you would probably end up replacing it with something else but yeah for something that you generate very quickly Yep this is definitely a sword but yeah definitely a lot of I don't know what is inappropriate about the the prompts that I use but apparently the tool did not like that uh try a tree yeah let's do a tree and see if it does a styliz tree or a realistic tree and then try out like a character or character by part something like that yeah I mean that's a that's a tree like this one looks pretty interesting I mean it's got the Flor whether you want it or not but yeah works better for things that are easy to find yeah I guess that's it which is kind of interesting because in theory like the goal of generative AI is generating things that are completely random those are usually the examples they give but yeah I guess this two would be better for things that are more normal rather than yeah rather than something that is very very unique very different but yeah and if I write a character what is it going to do I'm playing around with this and I have no idea the points okay apparently I just spent a th000 points I don't know yeah the points that is going to be another thing that is quite a bit tricky but hopefully they improve that over time okay yeah these definitely look quite rough say if you want to draw a tree or a sword that seems to work good like a coin so like for basic things that most most uh basic things that most games use it's probably going to be pretty good but anything more yeah keran might need more details given yeah definitely okay those are actually some very rough coins I definitely would expected to generate some like like a super basic gold coin so these are definitely quite a little bit rough we can use this as it on Steam technically yes because they said that they own all of their inputs so technically that does mean that you should own the the outputs for all this so technically that should not have issues although nobody ever knows what seam is actually going to do so that is quite tricky but yeah I mean this is a coin so if I were to create a2d object oh did I not install the Sprite package I didn't so let me just make a2d image instead to the image with a coin and put a coin and yeah there you go I mean that's a coin so yeah where is my canvas oh it's on the corner there all right yeah yeah so technically oh crap so Tech that is indeed a coin okay sure but yeah definitely the tool still needs quite a bit of work definitely very early access so yeah yeah but I'm curious to see how this improves over time with more training with more feedback from people it should hopefully be quite interesting question about multiplayer using Unity username and password so how can I make players search for each other uh you can't by default meaning I don't think Unity has a builtin tool for finding things I mean you can use the lobby and you can make a public Lobby and then automatically find the hey nice that's a fun one uh you can use the lobby service but by default you need some kind of server some kind of thing that has data of all the players that have signed in so I don't think Unity has any builtin thing for that of knowing which users are online at what time at what time so yeah you pretty much need to do something we kind of like have a general game Lobby like as soon as the player starts playing you send some data to a server that says okay this player is now starting to play then show that on the list of things but at the same time you should probably do uh I would probably just use Lobby so for that use case if you haven't seen it my tutorial on Lobby is pretty nice pretty not that one that one it's uh pretty good so I would probably use Lobby for that use case um okay dice again yeah pretty much all of these these are all very very rough but technically that is a dice I mean obviously the dots are very strange this looks very odd very odd but yeah technically for a quick prototype that would definitely be passable as a dice so yeah this looks unusable yeah right now it is definitely very rough uh but yeah curious to see how this to improves over time yeah uh okay what was I doing right so my super secret project which is yeah the uh so basly the secret project is this the question of the day so basically this is if you've been following the channel for quite a while you've probably seen me post a bunch of questions every once in a while on the unity Community tab Unity on the YouTube Community Tab and yeah so basically what I finally managed to do is after a long time I finally managed to work on this which is basically making an automated system so I wrote a bunch of questions and every 3 days I've got an automated thing that post the questions for example this question what is the significance of January 1st 1970 so is the is it the SCM release dat on the magnax Odyssey which by the way cool tip I think that was the very first console thing so yeah or is it the start of Unix time and this case yep I'm pretty sure that one is the start of Unix time and if that is correct that's a nice scen yep which are Unix s samp so if you don't know what is the significance of this date that is pretty much uh a Unix s samp is just an INT counting every second laps and every sing of laps since January 1st 1970 so Unix SS are super useful so basically the the secret feature is I've got I've automated the process of making a bunch of questions uh then I also have it to make automated emails so if you want you just get some nice fun questions in your inbox they get generated every 3 days and then you can try to answer the the question hopefully learn something new and then you can read a lot of detail on the various on the answer in order to understand okay so this one is Rel to Unique s Sams like for example if you don't know how to get a unique s Sams in C you can do it just like this so you can get that I've got a bunch of related videos where I used all kinds of timing logic all kinds of things so yeah basically you're telling scarm was not released 197 no probably not if they did that was definitely that would definitely be the work of a time traveler uh but yeah so I've got a video going more over in detail on this and basically for this system the one thing that I still need is I still need to edit a ton of the questions so I think I've done up until 25 and for the other ones I've got pretty much just an idea so basically this is where I this is my back end for writing the questions so I write a fun question like this one when create a new script you always have to extend modern behavior then the options yes no or only if you want to use that as a component and the answer is obviously see so you only need mon Behavior if you want to use it as a game object component ni making the tutoral about uni RX is that a testing tool or a dependency injection pretty sure I've heard of it uh yeah so anyway so mono behavior is only necessary if you want to have the functions called automatically however it is not absolutely necessary so basally this is the back end where I write the question I write the answers and all the things and then that turns into this page so this is the page that you would see you would see the question you try to answer it and then you see a bunch more details so hopefully it's a nice fun way to learn by answering a bunch of questions and it should be fun on a bunch of topics a bunch of things helpful links to help you learn a little bit so it should be fun what software you use for your website don't really use any software I mean for me my web dep skills are super basic like literally Bare Bones I pretty much just use the knowledge that I've gained oh crap the knowledge that I've known for about 10 years now so basically just basic HTML basic JavaScript basic PHP which as far as I know nowadays in webd PHP is pretty much I don't know it's supposedly horrible but for my super base use case uh it does work quite well so I quite like the language so it's an interesting one so yeah um yeah so basically I just need to continue so let me see if I can do like question 26 what is this one next place we need WR final text time to go hey bye thanks for being here that's cool PHP is awesome nice uh okay so yeah so basically I've got I've written 25 questions and a bunch of things so yeah I'm going to need to kind of write all of these so I've got a bunch of draft questions so I've got the question got the answers but then the answer is really simple so I've got about 70 of them written so I've still got about 50 of them to really flash out make something a bit more interesting so hopefully this should be a fun way to to learn answer a bunch of questions every few days and yeah this is something that I've wanted to do for quite a long time because I do think that it's a fun way to learn an easy way to learn integrate with GPT for automatic question generation uh probably because I don't think I trust it enough to know that it's accurate so I definitely want to do them manually based on my own knowledge so yeah I definitely want to do them manual but yeah over here like this it's um finally managed to automate this process so it's something that I've wanted to do for a while and yep I've got a video talking about it in more detail before I actually enable all this on the website because right now it's not yet fully enabled but yeah it should be fun what advice would you give to someone who wants to make games on their own meaning how can one learn a lot of things in this field so one can improve the answer is start with the absolute Basics so for me the main thing that I would point you to is to my free 10hour course I think that is a great one for complete beginners and people who are more intermediate users so I definitely encourage you to start from there and basically just remember that it takes time and focus on actually learning things so slowly learn the basics learn bit by bit and over time you will gain quite a lot of knowledge oh hey TJ hey thanks for being here nice yeah there's always more to learn with un yeah absolutely I mean part of the thing that is really awesome about these uh about these questions is how they are the S thing is automated and song random so of the 70 questions that I've written there are a bunch of them that I don't remember so I will also be receiving these emails and every once in a while also learning or remembering from the things that I that I've known in the past so yeah it's also going to be fun for me since it's such an automated thing as opposed to being manually manually me picking everything so yeah should be funing y get appreciated in the future nope I mean IM am GUI is still is still uh workable in the editor so so yep nope the UI I would say don't worry about it being deprecated if anything people are going to complain that Unity now has three UI systems because they don't like to deprecate things so yeah it's going to be pretty much like that thinking about jumping to the VR space yeah that is definitely one of those areas that I would love to would love to learn so yeah it's one of those things that's been on my todo list for ages and yeah it's always hard to find the time I mean when I was at unite I did see a talk about uh it was specifically from meta about their Quest three and specially about mixed reality about the pass through and does seem quite interesting and they do have quite a lot of quite a lot of new what do they call it like blocks like templates so like you want to get just a pass through working you literally just just drag a template and automatically sets up all the scripts all the things so yeah that is definitely one area that I very much would like to get into just need to find the time that is always always my issue be life support for animations is a big issue on uiit yeah that's that's the thing that I've heard that making animations is still not possible not doable so that is why I haven't really gotten into UI toet just yet because it still seems quite a bit underbaked how would you handle RTS resources in multiplayer uh I would handle it the same as anything else so pretty much only the host handles the resources only the host actually has like the resource manager thing only the host handles the totals and all the clients they ask the host okay do we have resources to spend this if so yes or no so yeah pretty much the same thing as on my on my multiplayer game on the free multiplayer course over here I also did um the recipes the recipes these are also the way they are generated and the way they are spawned randomly these are all only happening on the host so the host is the one that manages all of that choosing all the recipes which one to spawn so yep for an RTS this is only the same thing that I would do only the host manages what resource actually exist have conflict multiple clients no because all the clients they don't store any resource they just ask the host okay do we have enough wood to place this and then the host tells you yes we do and the host actually place the wood and so on so you wouldn't have multiple resource managers you would have just one on the host the client simply ask the host can we build this or not want to learn programming patterns from you that's actually something that I've wanted to do for a while is making a course just based on programming patterns I think that would be quite fun so one of the many things on my tun list if I can eventually get to it then that should be fun plans for gdau courses or tutorials not really I mean just uh Unity is really the thing where is all my knowledge so the reason why I have this channel teaching is because I have 10 years of experience making games with unity so if I went to a different engine it would take me quite a long time in order to get comfortable enough with the engine in order to feel like I can actually teach the people so yep pretty much planning to yeah what Happ to your Discord server I just couldn't keep up with it that's that's pretty much a simple answer I mean I'm already so busy trying to answer all the comments every single day trying to answer uh all of the emails all the course questions and so on so yeah trying to keep up with Discord which specifically is a real time time thing that was very very tricky so so yeah that is why I couldn't really make it we have tutorial on these guys walking around I do I do on the end of this page if you go to the bottom of that page over here are the tutorials for how I made this oh boy my voice is really messed up so I really really got to go so if you're curious how I made this this whole thing down here this is a transparent TNT window for the character these are using mesh based animations for interacting with YouTube API that is a simple HTTP request and for the characters how they are randomly generating these are the exact same code that I use in my game battle Tycoon so yep if you want to learn how I made this that is pretty much it okay game programming patterns yeah I've heard great things about that book I really need to get it but yeah I've definitely heard that recommendation quite a while so yeah I definitely would love to because honestly my issue is since I never went to college I don't really have a uh what do you call it like an official knowledge of patterns like I know how to write code I know how to use various patterns but if you tell me if you ask me what specific pattern am I using here I probably couldn't tell you I probably couldn't tell you what is like the factory pattern I know that involves a factory that constructs an object something like that but yeah I definitely have an an issue with finding the names that people use to refer to things so yeah I would love to read that book in order to basically assign names to all the knowledge that I already have I think that would be quite fun so I would love to love to be able to do that okay so I think that's going to be it because my voice is really already messed up like I said I have no idea how on Earth do people do 12hour live streams this seems really impossible oh man I'm really messed up anyways okay so yeah thank you all so much for joining me I hope this was interesting educational entertaining I hope so I definitely would love to do these more often if I can find a way to set up some kind of schedule but yeah anyway it was fun I did manage to do a bit of work so preparing for a lot of future tutorials a lot of future things so got a lot of work to do a lot of things to do but yeah thank you all so much for being here and yeah let me just set this up put up the background and pick up OB Edge and yep all right okay so yeah thank you all so much for being here here I hope you found it interesting so yep thanks so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye everyone thanks byebye
