With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K Mony Unity
00:02 - has just launched their Unity 2024
00:04 - gaming report these usually are filmed
00:06 - with tons of really useful info tons of
00:08 - very interesting stuff so let's quickly
00:09 - go through it and see all the main
00:11 - highlights Unity sponsored this video to
00:13 - do this summary and also to let you know
00:15 - about the recently released awesome Mega
00:16 - City metro sample this is a complete
00:18 - multiplayer game sample like we're going
00:20 - to see in a bit multiplayer is a big
00:22 - trend for the future this sample has
00:24 - tons of features it supports 128 players
00:26 - it's crossplatform it has interpolation
00:29 - prediction and life compensation it
00:31 - incorporates many of the unity
00:32 - multiplayer tools like game server
00:33 - hosting Matchmaker vvox and Lobby so
00:36 - this is a really great really complete
00:37 - sample you can inspect all the source
00:39 - code to see how it all works go ahead
00:41 - and download it for free with the link
00:42 - in the description and now back to the
00:43 - gaming report this report is split into
00:46 - five different trends that are shaping
00:48 - game development so the first one is
00:49 - devs are adopting AI tools to save time
00:52 - and yep 2023 will go down in history as
00:54 - year the AI was suddenly everywhere and
00:56 - that's apparently true in game
00:57 - development as well with 62% of Studios
00:59 - using AI workflows mainly to prototype
01:02 - quickly and for concepting asset
01:03 - creation and World building it's
01:05 - obviously no surprise seeing that AI is
01:06 - one of the main Trends the second trend
01:08 - is how studios are diversifying their
01:10 - revenue approaches and apparently how as
01:12 - in a purchase average revenue per daily
01:14 - active user declines in app advertising
01:17 - is on the rise now this actually
01:19 - something that does surprise me I pretty
01:20 - much only play premium games I pretty
01:22 - much never play anything on mobile so it
01:24 - does surpris me to see that apparently
01:26 - inapp purchases are going down and ads
01:27 - in games are on the rise so that is
01:29 - definitely very interesting I wonder
01:30 - what is the mix on these stats between
01:32 - premium games like PC console games and
01:34 - mobile games that's definitely very
01:36 - interesting then Trend number three
01:37 - Studios of all sizes are shipping to
01:39 - more platforms and Yep this definitely
01:40 - does make sense the more platforms you
01:42 - can get your game on the better your
01:44 - odds of finding success overall I'm
01:46 - going to say for me personally my last
01:47 - game dinky Guardians so far it is cly
01:49 - only on PC only on Steam but I've
01:51 - actually been in the process of putting
01:53 - the game on Xbox this is going to be the
01:55 - first game that I've ever made that is
01:56 - available on a console I had to pause
01:58 - that for a while while I was working on
01:59 - my C course but now that it's done I
02:01 - definitely want to get back to it while
02:02 - multiplatform reach challenges more devs
02:05 - are designing it is worth it especially
02:06 - Indies so if you are making games
02:08 - remember there's more to games than just
02:10 - PC just steam then Trend number four
02:12 - devs prioritized multiplayer games
02:13 - despite greater complexity and cost for
02:16 - many people the social dimension of
02:17 - gaming is a must and studios are
02:19 - responding to this demand in 23 mobile
02:21 - only games with multiplayer features
02:22 - have 40% more monthly active users than
02:24 - single player games and multiplayer
02:26 - Gaming revenue grew by 2.3 billion
02:28 - that's a 10% Lift This is the definitely
02:30 - very interesting for me personally I
02:31 - prefer to play just single player games
02:33 - but I do know that multiplayer games are
02:35 - massive if you make a multiplayer game
02:36 - your odds of finding massive success
02:38 - definitely increase whereas on single
02:40 - player games you have sort of a ceiling
02:42 - sort of a cap whereas on multiplayer
02:44 - games you have something like lethal
02:45 - company which is a massive Monumental
02:47 - hit it definitely would not be this big
02:49 - if it wasn't in multiplayer and Trend
02:51 - number five the industry is building
02:52 - stronger Brands by extending engagement
02:54 - studios are only to extend the lifespans
02:56 - of their game IPS by deepening audience
02:58 - attachment Analytics Services used to
03:00 - tailor updates to players increased by
03:02 - 44% so basically developers using data
03:04 - in order to improve their games based on
03:06 - how the players are actually playing
03:07 - them and personally what I find most
03:09 - interesting is while 27% developers we
03:11 - pulled report incorporating user
03:13 - generated content ugc into their games
03:15 - to invite greater engagement I do think
03:17 - that if you are an indie game developer
03:19 - this is one of the best ways to increase
03:21 - the sealing potential for your game if
03:23 - you had some kind of user generated
03:24 - content like something as simple as a
03:26 - level editor or something a lot more
03:27 - complex for example terrarian minecft
03:30 - these are Mega hits specifically because
03:31 - of all the user generating content that
03:33 - is built on top of it and if you want to
03:34 - add user generating cont to your game
03:36 - unity also has a really interesting tool
03:38 - for it I made a tutorial video if you
03:40 - want to learn how that works so these
03:41 - are the five main Trends and then we can
03:43 - see all the thata inside this report as
03:45 - you can see this is definitely massive
03:46 - there's tons and tons of info here so
03:48 - I'm really only going to go through some
03:50 - highlights and I invite you to check the
03:51 - link in order to read all this
03:53 - information in your own time the big
03:54 - trend is AI and how Studios want to work
03:56 - faster and more efficiently some really
03:58 - interesting STS how the time to launch
04:00 - for games has increased from 218 days in
04:03 - 22 to 304 days in 23 so nowadays there
04:06 - is so much competition you really need
04:08 - your game to be excellent and building
04:10 - Excellence takes time so it makes sense
04:12 - that games have taken longer and longer
04:13 - to develop so because that it's no
04:15 - wonder that they are basically exploring
04:16 - tools to speed up production and one of
04:18 - those tools obviously being Ai and in
04:20 - 2023 Unity study showed that 71% of
04:23 - studos that are using AI say that it's
04:25 - improved their delivery and operations
04:27 - these are very interesting stats and
04:28 - over here we have some more detail so
04:30 - how studios are using AI in what
04:32 - specific areas and the first one is
04:33 - actually interesting it's for improving
04:35 - character animations I haven't yet seen
04:37 - that many AI animation tools so I wonder
04:39 - what this is about the only one that I
04:41 - know is casador so I wonder if this is
04:42 - the main one they're using and unity
04:44 - themselves are working on an AI tool
04:46 - Muse animate I have to say this
04:48 - definitely one of the use case that I'm
04:49 - personally most interested for in terms
04:51 - of AI the asset swur does have tons of
04:53 - Animation packs but finding specifically
04:55 - what you want when you want something
04:56 - extremely specific it takes such a long
04:58 - time in order to go through all these
05:00 - packs so for protyping I think being
05:02 - able to do text to animation I think
05:04 - that is really quite useful so it's
05:05 - interesting to see how 46% of studios
05:07 - are using it specifically to improve
05:08 - character animations but then something
05:10 - surprising to me is over here that 37%
05:13 - are using AI to write code or speed up
05:15 - code writing now the reason why I say
05:16 - this is interesting to me is because
05:18 - personally I've used AI code writing a
05:20 - little bit and I have to say my opinion
05:22 - was definitely not positive basically
05:24 - when I tried it I found that the
05:25 - suggestions that the code would give me
05:27 - were always very strange they were never
05:29 - EXA what I was trying to get so when I
05:31 - Tred basically meant that I was writing
05:32 - code and then my brain was basically
05:34 - being broken by having to read the
05:35 - suggestions that the code completion was
05:37 - doing and since most of the time it was
05:39 - not at all what I was trying to do
05:40 - because that I was basically having to
05:42 - break my brain in order to read the
05:43 - suggestion delete the suggestion and go
05:45 - back to working as I was so personally
05:47 - when I tried using AI to write code I
05:48 - did not enjoy it it was not a positive
05:50 - experience however that was also back
05:52 - when AI was in its infancy I think I
05:54 - tried it over a year ago so maybe
05:55 - nowadays things are better if 37% of
05:58 - studios are using it to write code in
05:59 - speed up Cod writing then I guess that
06:01 - means it must have some use case then at
06:03 - 36% we have generating artwork and game
06:05 - levels I'm actually surprised that this
06:06 - one is a little bit low then writing and
06:08 - narrative design automated play testing
06:10 - Adaptive Difficulty and in-game text and
06:12 - voice chat moderation this one also
06:14 - seems a bit low because AI seems perfect
06:16 - for in-game text and voice chat
06:18 - moderation yeah in general already a
06:20 - surprising high amount of use case for
06:21 - AI in various Studios 71% Studios that
06:24 - report using AI say it's improved their
06:26 - delivery and operations one of the main
06:28 - use cases for AI is to help you when
06:30 - prototyping and apparently most Studios
06:32 - keep their prototypes either under a
06:33 - month above a week or under 3 months I
06:35 - have to say 3 months for making a
06:37 - prototype seems quite excessive but I
06:39 - guess when you have a studio with tons
06:41 - and tons of people then at that point
06:42 - you really only want to involve the
06:43 - entire team when you are really sure
06:45 - that you are going to pursue that idea
06:46 - so I guess the bigger your studio make
06:48 - sense that your prototypes become more
06:49 - and more complex and again for the
06:51 - prototyping stage I do think that's
06:52 - where AI really shines and in terms of
06:55 - why studio is UN Embrace AI apparently
06:56 - the reason is lack of time or knowhow is
06:58 - the biggest blocker to AI tool adoption
07:00 - so most people have some interest but
07:02 - not enough time some people don't have
07:04 - the technical skills others don't know
07:06 - that it's possible and others don't know
07:07 - the purpose so since AI is so new it is
07:09 - still very difficult in order to figure
07:11 - out all the various use cases for it
07:12 - there are many things it can do but it's
07:14 - also tricky in order to figure out which
07:16 - one of those use cases is actually
07:17 - useful to you using AI just because you
07:19 - want to use AI that's really not very
07:20 - helpful it's really just a tool so it's
07:22 - really only meant to be used in such a
07:23 - way that it does help you make your
07:25 - games there are some nice tips on how AI
07:27 - could help you so first reduce tedious
07:29 - production uction work so delegate
07:30 - monotonous tasks like resizing upscaling
07:32 - and fixing Revolution issues there's
07:34 - definitely an interesting use case if
07:35 - you have a ton of strange assets then to
07:38 - prototype in your own style this is
07:39 - interesting given how many tools
07:41 - nowadays you have style guides that they
07:42 - can follow so you can generate multiple
07:45 - assets all following the same style that
07:46 - is usually the biggest problem when you
07:48 - use some kind of AI or even just
07:50 - standard assets the issue is that they
07:52 - really don't fit together but using
07:53 - stound guides can definitely help make
07:55 - it look a bit more cohesive then to
07:57 - iterate with speed and ease this is
07:58 - really what I find most useful use case
08:00 - for AI just being able to very quickly
08:02 - get a prototype up and running then find
08:04 - and distill resources quickly this one
08:06 - can be useful if you're in the learning
08:07 - stage chatting with an AI can definitely
08:10 - help you learn a little bit then to test
08:11 - and troubleshoot your code or build
08:13 - Innovative new features with AI models
08:15 - or run AI models directly on user
08:17 - devices see if there are definitely
08:18 - plenty of use case for AI plenty of ways
08:21 - in which can help you make better games
08:22 - and make them faster and right now
08:24 - there's already quite a lot of resource
08:25 - that Unity has made and they're
08:27 - continually making a bunch more then on
08:28 - turn two which is how sud are
08:30 - diversifying their revenue approaches
08:32 - like I said this definitely not an area
08:33 - that I'm very familiar with I just make
08:35 - premium games just pay once and that's
08:36 - it but apparently looking at these quick
08:38 - charts apparently Mobile gaming is
08:39 - sustaining growth so that's good I guess
08:41 - median mobile play retention is slightly
08:43 - down worldwide inapp Revenue purchases
08:45 - are also down payer rates are also
08:47 - decreasing purchase transactions and
08:49 - average spend per payer remain steady
08:51 - IAA revenue is way up year over year I'm
08:53 - not sure what is IAA then simulation
08:56 - casual and puzzle games are seeing
08:57 - growth games with diverse set strategy
08:59 - show higher engagement and games using
09:01 - both reward videos and offer wall
09:03 - improve retention so like I said this
09:04 - not my area so I can't really comment
09:06 - much on all this but if you are into
09:08 - making mobile games definitely check out
09:10 - this entire report there's a ton of info
09:12 - over here that I'm sure won't be helpful
09:13 - to you on Trend three Studios of all
09:15 - sizes are shipping to more platforms yep
09:17 - if you make your game if you can reach
09:19 - more people by just making a different
09:21 - build that is objectively a good thing
09:22 - more games are being built on three plus
09:24 - platforms so that's a preise b increase
09:26 - from 22 to 23 from 33,000 games to
09:29 - 44,000 that is a ton of games for the
09:32 - platform choices it seems that the
09:34 - majority is mobile and desktop then a
09:36 - bunch more on console and then way down
09:38 - here is VR web browser and social
09:40 - networking however apparently developers
09:42 - are split on multiplatform roll out
09:44 - strategies so that's a pre- even slit
09:46 - between simultaneous staggered and no
09:48 - allout strategy in my case my advice for
09:50 - IND devs kind of like me so Solo or a
09:53 - very small team one to5 in that I would
09:55 - probably say that stagger release that
09:56 - probably makes a lot more sense unless
09:58 - of course you can manage to get a deal
10:00 - that requires you to do a simultaneous
10:01 - roll out I say that just because it's
10:03 - much easier to manage Just One release
10:04 - as opposed to multiple releases at the
10:06 - same time that is definitely quite
10:07 - tricky developers are prioritizing
10:09 - crossplatform play now this definitely
10:11 - great to see if you are going to put
10:12 - your game on multiple platforms and if
10:14 - your game is something like multiplayer
10:16 - it definitely helps for those people to
10:17 - be able to play between all the
10:18 - platforms it's really great to see 95%
10:20 - of Studios above 50 people are using
10:22 - crossplatform that on Trend four devs
10:24 - prioritize multiplayer despite greater
10:26 - complexity and cost however at the same
10:28 - time while I would would say definitely
10:29 - great complexity to make a multiplayer
10:31 - game as opposed to a single player
10:32 - thanks to the tools nowadays making
10:34 - multiplayer games is really much easier
10:36 - than it ever was I made a video on
10:37 - exactly this topic on how with all of
10:39 - these tools it makes it so much easier
10:41 - to handle multiplayer games but on the
10:42 - other hand there is also a lot of
10:43 - competition so Studios focused on
10:45 - multiplayer games over here we have 62%
10:48 - on multiplayer so that's a ton of
10:49 - Studios making a ton of multiplayer
10:51 - games and again all of those multiplayer
10:53 - games require a ton of time from all the
10:55 - players usually what happens in
10:56 - multiplayer is pretty much a winner
10:57 - takes all so everybody plays fortnite
10:59 - not many people play the second game and
11:01 - it's interesting how couch Co-op is here
11:03 - it's only 6% but still nice to see
11:05 - here's a nice quote as competition and
11:07 - Market saturation increases it's hard to
11:09 - succeed with a multiplayer game it's
11:11 - attractive to be on as many platforms as
11:13 - possible to be able to meet players and
11:14 - their friends wherever they are
11:15 - throughout the day you want to make it
11:17 - as convenient as possible for them to
11:18 - reach the game so y multiplayer and
11:20 - multiplatform kind of go hand in hand if
11:22 - you can make a game that works both on
11:24 - PC consoles and mobile then you have
11:26 - players can play your game from pretty
11:27 - much anywhere and in terms of
11:28 - multiplayer Gaming revenue it does
11:30 - continue to rise so 24 billion in 22 to
11:33 - 28 billion now in 24 then some
11:35 - interesting tips on how to scale your
11:36 - multiplayer game so the first one is
11:38 - find the fun fast and keep itating this
11:40 - is probably the most important one since
11:42 - multiplayer games are usually all about
11:43 - the core gameplay Loop you're constantly
11:45 - doing the same thing over and over again
11:46 - because that it is really important that
11:48 - you find the fun in that corner Loop and
11:49 - then keep it raing upon it then another
11:51 - one important one is don't underestimate
11:53 - the cost of re architecture meaning if
11:55 - you define that your game is going to be
11:57 - peer-to-peer definitely remember that if
11:58 - later on you want to change the
11:59 - dedicated server that is going to
12:01 - require quite a significant cost so you
12:03 - should probably establish what
12:04 - architecture you're going with either
12:06 - dedicated server or peer-to-peer
12:07 - definitely decide that earlier on in the
12:09 - death cycle and of course prioritize on
12:11 - performance nobody likes playing a laggy
12:13 - multiplayer game player communication is
12:16 - key so having some ways for your players
12:17 - to communicate with one another that is
12:19 - definitely useful and consider player
12:21 - retention and community help basically
12:22 - if you're going to make a multiplayer
12:23 - game then you have to have some kind of
12:25 - Community Management check out my video
12:27 - to learn about the many multiplayer
12:28 - tools that un has and Trend five the
12:30 - industry is building stronger Brands by
12:32 - extending engagement seeing here there's
12:34 - no such thing as set it and forgetting
12:35 - in game development it is essential to
12:37 - start planning liveops cont roll out and
12:39 - update strategies right from the start
12:41 - again this is another thing that I
12:42 - really don't have much experience with
12:44 - for me most my games are one and done
12:46 - I've tried doing a few DLCs for one of
12:48 - my games but it didn't really work out
12:50 - too well so I haven't tried it too much
12:52 - so this is really more advice for bigger
12:54 - Studios as opposed to Solo or one to
12:56 - five in the game developers developers
12:57 - begin planning between production and
12:59 - pre-launch studos test more markets and
13:01 - offer new content frequently most
13:03 - developers update their game for one to
13:05 - two years that's interesting players are
13:06 - making devs take toxic Community
13:08 - seriously always a big problem in Live
13:10 - service games Studios favor daily
13:12 - rewards and missions as engagement
13:13 - techniques liveop Services take an
13:15 - average of four months to see
13:16 - significant use that's an interesting
13:17 - one and use generated content is a Hot
13:19 - Topic this one that even if you are
13:21 - making a single play game you should
13:22 - definitely sell look into it normally
13:24 - implementing some kind of Workshop
13:25 - support with custom characters or custom
13:27 - levels usually that isn't isn't too
13:29 - laborious and if you do it right any if
13:31 - your players pick up the game that can
13:33 - definitely bring your game to a second
13:34 - life in a recent survey 52% of us Gamers
13:37 - say that the ability to generate content
13:39 - gets them to play longer while 34% would
13:41 - make content and 31% say they would
13:44 - spend money on downloadable content on a
13:46 - game with ugc so in conclusion in 2023
13:48 - developers looked for stability
13:50 - persistent economic uncertainty LED
13:52 - Studios toward new technologies to
13:54 - increase efficiency and they try to
13:56 - maximize game awareness through
13:57 - Diversified monetization strategy
13:59 - expanded platform releases multiplayer
14:01 - functionality and engagement tactics
14:03 - this past year was definitely very
14:05 - difficult for game developers so many
14:06 - layoffs on so many studios even on
14:08 - successful Studios staying up to date
14:10 - with these Trends can hopefully help you
14:11 - find success in general here are the
14:13 - five trends that we predict will shape
14:14 - 2024 and Beyond so AI use in the gaming
14:17 - industry will deepen and become
14:18 - normalized mobile Studios will continue
14:21 - expanding to PC and consoles there won't
14:22 - be great demand for extended reality
14:24 - games that's interesting developers will
14:26 - explore new business model in revenue
14:28 - streams and cloud services will become
14:30 - integral to games by improving Studio
14:32 - efficiency so definitely lots and lots
14:33 - of really interesting data in this

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your K Mony Unity has just launched their Unity 2024 gaming report these usually are filmed with tons of really useful info tons of very interesting stuff so let's quickly go through it and see all the main highlights Unity sponsored this video to do this summary and also to let you know about the recently released awesome Mega City metro sample this is a complete multiplayer game sample like we're going to see in a bit multiplayer is a big trend for the future this sample has tons of features it supports 128 players it's crossplatform it has interpolation prediction and life compensation it incorporates many of the unity multiplayer tools like game server hosting Matchmaker vvox and Lobby so this is a really great really complete sample you can inspect all the source code to see how it all works go ahead and download it for free with the link in the description and now back to the gaming report this report is split into five different trends that are shaping game development so the first one is devs are adopting AI tools to save time and yep 2023 will go down in history as year the AI was suddenly everywhere and that's apparently true in game development as well with 62% of Studios using AI workflows mainly to prototype quickly and for concepting asset creation and World building it's obviously no surprise seeing that AI is one of the main Trends the second trend is how studios are diversifying their revenue approaches and apparently how as in a purchase average revenue per daily active user declines in app advertising is on the rise now this actually something that does surprise me I pretty much only play premium games I pretty much never play anything on mobile so it does surpris me to see that apparently inapp purchases are going down and ads in games are on the rise so that is definitely very interesting I wonder what is the mix on these stats between premium games like PC console games and mobile games that's definitely very interesting then Trend number three Studios of all sizes are shipping to more platforms and Yep this definitely does make sense the more platforms you can get your game on the better your odds of finding success overall I'm going to say for me personally my last game dinky Guardians so far it is cly only on PC only on Steam but I've actually been in the process of putting the game on Xbox this is going to be the first game that I've ever made that is available on a console I had to pause that for a while while I was working on my C course but now that it's done I definitely want to get back to it while multiplatform reach challenges more devs are designing it is worth it especially Indies so if you are making games remember there's more to games than just PC just steam then Trend number four devs prioritized multiplayer games despite greater complexity and cost for many people the social dimension of gaming is a must and studios are responding to this demand in 23 mobile only games with multiplayer features have 40% more monthly active users than single player games and multiplayer Gaming revenue grew by 2.3 billion that's a 10% Lift This is the definitely very interesting for me personally I prefer to play just single player games but I do know that multiplayer games are massive if you make a multiplayer game your odds of finding massive success definitely increase whereas on single player games you have sort of a ceiling sort of a cap whereas on multiplayer games you have something like lethal company which is a massive Monumental hit it definitely would not be this big if it wasn't in multiplayer and Trend number five the industry is building stronger Brands by extending engagement studios are only to extend the lifespans of their game IPS by deepening audience attachment Analytics Services used to tailor updates to players increased by 44% so basically developers using data in order to improve their games based on how the players are actually playing them and personally what I find most interesting is while 27% developers we pulled report incorporating user generated content ugc into their games to invite greater engagement I do think that if you are an indie game developer this is one of the best ways to increase the sealing potential for your game if you had some kind of user generated content like something as simple as a level editor or something a lot more complex for example terrarian minecft these are Mega hits specifically because of all the user generating content that is built on top of it and if you want to add user generating cont to your game unity also has a really interesting tool for it I made a tutorial video if you want to learn how that works so these are the five main Trends and then we can see all the thata inside this report as you can see this is definitely massive there's tons and tons of info here so I'm really only going to go through some highlights and I invite you to check the link in order to read all this information in your own time the big trend is AI and how Studios want to work faster and more efficiently some really interesting STS how the time to launch for games has increased from 218 days in 22 to 304 days in 23 so nowadays there is so much competition you really need your game to be excellent and building Excellence takes time so it makes sense that games have taken longer and longer to develop so because that it's no wonder that they are basically exploring tools to speed up production and one of those tools obviously being Ai and in 2023 Unity study showed that 71% of studos that are using AI say that it's improved their delivery and operations these are very interesting stats and over here we have some more detail so how studios are using AI in what specific areas and the first one is actually interesting it's for improving character animations I haven't yet seen that many AI animation tools so I wonder what this is about the only one that I know is casador so I wonder if this is the main one they're using and unity themselves are working on an AI tool Muse animate I have to say this definitely one of the use case that I'm personally most interested for in terms of AI the asset swur does have tons of Animation packs but finding specifically what you want when you want something extremely specific it takes such a long time in order to go through all these packs so for protyping I think being able to do text to animation I think that is really quite useful so it's interesting to see how 46% of studios are using it specifically to improve character animations but then something surprising to me is over here that 37% are using AI to write code or speed up code writing now the reason why I say this is interesting to me is because personally I've used AI code writing a little bit and I have to say my opinion was definitely not positive basically when I tried it I found that the suggestions that the code would give me were always very strange they were never EXA what I was trying to get so when I Tred basically meant that I was writing code and then my brain was basically being broken by having to read the suggestions that the code completion was doing and since most of the time it was not at all what I was trying to do because that I was basically having to break my brain in order to read the suggestion delete the suggestion and go back to working as I was so personally when I tried using AI to write code I did not enjoy it it was not a positive experience however that was also back when AI was in its infancy I think I tried it over a year ago so maybe nowadays things are better if 37% of studios are using it to write code in speed up Cod writing then I guess that means it must have some use case then at 36% we have generating artwork and game levels I'm actually surprised that this one is a little bit low then writing and narrative design automated play testing Adaptive Difficulty and ingame text and voice chat moderation this one also seems a bit low because AI seems perfect for ingame text and voice chat moderation yeah in general already a surprising high amount of use case for AI in various Studios 71% Studios that report using AI say it's improved their delivery and operations one of the main use cases for AI is to help you when prototyping and apparently most Studios keep their prototypes either under a month above a week or under 3 months I have to say 3 months for making a prototype seems quite excessive but I guess when you have a studio with tons and tons of people then at that point you really only want to involve the entire team when you are really sure that you are going to pursue that idea so I guess the bigger your studio make sense that your prototypes become more and more complex and again for the prototyping stage I do think that's where AI really shines and in terms of why studio is UN Embrace AI apparently the reason is lack of time or knowhow is the biggest blocker to AI tool adoption so most people have some interest but not enough time some people don't have the technical skills others don't know that it's possible and others don't know the purpose so since AI is so new it is still very difficult in order to figure out all the various use cases for it there are many things it can do but it's also tricky in order to figure out which one of those use cases is actually useful to you using AI just because you want to use AI that's really not very helpful it's really just a tool so it's really only meant to be used in such a way that it does help you make your games there are some nice tips on how AI could help you so first reduce tedious production uction work so delegate monotonous tasks like resizing upscaling and fixing Revolution issues there's definitely an interesting use case if you have a ton of strange assets then to prototype in your own style this is interesting given how many tools nowadays you have style guides that they can follow so you can generate multiple assets all following the same style that is usually the biggest problem when you use some kind of AI or even just standard assets the issue is that they really don't fit together but using stound guides can definitely help make it look a bit more cohesive then to iterate with speed and ease this is really what I find most useful use case for AI just being able to very quickly get a prototype up and running then find and distill resources quickly this one can be useful if you're in the learning stage chatting with an AI can definitely help you learn a little bit then to test and troubleshoot your code or build Innovative new features with AI models or run AI models directly on user devices see if there are definitely plenty of use case for AI plenty of ways in which can help you make better games and make them faster and right now there's already quite a lot of resource that Unity has made and they're continually making a bunch more then on turn two which is how sud are diversifying their revenue approaches like I said this definitely not an area that I'm very familiar with I just make premium games just pay once and that's it but apparently looking at these quick charts apparently Mobile gaming is sustaining growth so that's good I guess median mobile play retention is slightly down worldwide inapp Revenue purchases are also down payer rates are also decreasing purchase transactions and average spend per payer remain steady IAA revenue is way up year over year I'm not sure what is IAA then simulation casual and puzzle games are seeing growth games with diverse set strategy show higher engagement and games using both reward videos and offer wall improve retention so like I said this not my area so I can't really comment much on all this but if you are into making mobile games definitely check out this entire report there's a ton of info over here that I'm sure won't be helpful to you on Trend three Studios of all sizes are shipping to more platforms yep if you make your game if you can reach more people by just making a different build that is objectively a good thing more games are being built on three plus platforms so that's a preise b increase from 22 to 23 from 33,000 games to 44,000 that is a ton of games for the platform choices it seems that the majority is mobile and desktop then a bunch more on console and then way down here is VR web browser and social networking however apparently developers are split on multiplatform roll out strategies so that's a pre even slit between simultaneous staggered and no allout strategy in my case my advice for IND devs kind of like me so Solo or a very small team one to5 in that I would probably say that stagger release that probably makes a lot more sense unless of course you can manage to get a deal that requires you to do a simultaneous roll out I say that just because it's much easier to manage Just One release as opposed to multiple releases at the same time that is definitely quite tricky developers are prioritizing crossplatform play now this definitely great to see if you are going to put your game on multiple platforms and if your game is something like multiplayer it definitely helps for those people to be able to play between all the platforms it's really great to see 95% of Studios above 50 people are using crossplatform that on Trend four devs prioritize multiplayer despite greater complexity and cost however at the same time while I would would say definitely great complexity to make a multiplayer game as opposed to a single player thanks to the tools nowadays making multiplayer games is really much easier than it ever was I made a video on exactly this topic on how with all of these tools it makes it so much easier to handle multiplayer games but on the other hand there is also a lot of competition so Studios focused on multiplayer games over here we have 62% on multiplayer so that's a ton of Studios making a ton of multiplayer games and again all of those multiplayer games require a ton of time from all the players usually what happens in multiplayer is pretty much a winner takes all so everybody plays fortnite not many people play the second game and it's interesting how couch Coop is here it's only 6% but still nice to see here's a nice quote as competition and Market saturation increases it's hard to succeed with a multiplayer game it's attractive to be on as many platforms as possible to be able to meet players and their friends wherever they are throughout the day you want to make it as convenient as possible for them to reach the game so y multiplayer and multiplatform kind of go hand in hand if you can make a game that works both on PC consoles and mobile then you have players can play your game from pretty much anywhere and in terms of multiplayer Gaming revenue it does continue to rise so 24 billion in 22 to 28 billion now in 24 then some interesting tips on how to scale your multiplayer game so the first one is find the fun fast and keep itating this is probably the most important one since multiplayer games are usually all about the core gameplay Loop you're constantly doing the same thing over and over again because that it is really important that you find the fun in that corner Loop and then keep it raing upon it then another one important one is don't underestimate the cost of re architecture meaning if you define that your game is going to be peertopeer definitely remember that if later on you want to change the dedicated server that is going to require quite a significant cost so you should probably establish what architecture you're going with either dedicated server or peertopeer definitely decide that earlier on in the death cycle and of course prioritize on performance nobody likes playing a laggy multiplayer game player communication is key so having some ways for your players to communicate with one another that is definitely useful and consider player retention and community help basically if you're going to make a multiplayer game then you have to have some kind of Community Management check out my video to learn about the many multiplayer tools that un has and Trend five the industry is building stronger Brands by extending engagement seeing here there's no such thing as set it and forgetting in game development it is essential to start planning liveops cont roll out and update strategies right from the start again this is another thing that I really don't have much experience with for me most my games are one and done I've tried doing a few DLCs for one of my games but it didn't really work out too well so I haven't tried it too much so this is really more advice for bigger Studios as opposed to Solo or one to five in the game developers developers begin planning between production and prelaunch studos test more markets and offer new content frequently most developers update their game for one to two years that's interesting players are making devs take toxic Community seriously always a big problem in Live service games Studios favor daily rewards and missions as engagement techniques liveop Services take an average of four months to see significant use that's an interesting one and use generated content is a Hot Topic this one that even if you are making a single play game you should definitely sell look into it normally implementing some kind of Workshop support with custom characters or custom levels usually that isn't isn't too laborious and if you do it right any if your players pick up the game that can definitely bring your game to a second life in a recent survey 52% of us Gamers say that the ability to generate content gets them to play longer while 34% would make content and 31% say they would spend money on downloadable content on a game with ugc so in conclusion in 2023 developers looked for stability persistent economic uncertainty LED Studios toward new technologies to increase efficiency and they try to maximize game awareness through Diversified monetization strategy expanded platform releases multiplayer functionality and engagement tactics this past year was definitely very difficult for game developers so many layoffs on so many studios even on successful Studios staying up to date with these Trends can hopefully help you find success in general here are the five trends that we predict will shape 2024 and Beyond so AI use in the gaming industry will deepen and become normalized mobile Studios will continue expanding to PC and consoles there won't be great demand for extended reality games that's interesting developers will explore new business model in revenue streams and cloud services will become integral to games by improving Studio efficiency so definitely lots and lots of really interesting data in this report I highly encourage you to check the link the description and go download it there's a mountain of information inside of this beyond what I covered here basically the goal with reading stuff like this is so that you can be much more informed which in turn will hopefully help you make better decisions to hopefully help you make better games and find success with them all right so I hope you found this useful thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
