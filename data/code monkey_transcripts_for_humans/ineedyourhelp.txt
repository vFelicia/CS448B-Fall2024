00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and it's finally time I need your help
00:04 - with something for the past three months
00:06 - I've been working really hard on
00:07 - something truly special basically it's a
00:09 - complete phone course that I'm releasing
00:11 - here as a free YouTube video as usual
00:13 - the project scope got kind of out of
00:15 - hand the initial goal was to make a
00:17 - quick free two or three hour course well
00:19 - in the end it ended up being over 10
00:21 - hours long so it took much longer to
00:23 - make but the great news is there's tons
00:25 - of awesome content for you to learn I
00:27 - even uploaded the game to Sims so you
00:28 - can right now go ahead onto the same
00:30 - page and add it to your wish list the
00:32 - game will launch at the same time as the
00:34 - course it's targeted at both complete
00:36 - beginners and more intermediate users it
00:38 - starts off really simple just focus on
00:40 - the basics and then over 45 lectures you
00:43 - will learn more and more complex things
00:44 - and the way that in your help is very
00:46 - simple when you see this video on your
00:49 - YouTube timeline or the suggest videos
00:50 - go ahead click on it right away then hit
00:53 - the like button and watch the video
00:54 - that's it I'll explain how that helps in
00:57 - a bit but first here's some detail on
00:59 - what the free course is all about out
01:00 - the game is a kitchen management game
01:02 - now I chose this design for two reasons
01:05 - one is because this actually involves
01:07 - quite a lot of systems which makes for a
01:09 - great learning project you will learn
01:10 - unity and c-sharp Basics how to make a
01:12 - character controller test for collisions
01:14 - and interact with objects how to use
01:16 - script long objects Shader graph and
01:18 - scene machine how to handle game logic
01:20 - spawning objects moving them using the
01:22 - new input system doing some Polish and
01:24 - tons more after following this course
01:26 - and learning all these techniques you
01:27 - will be able to build all kinds of games
01:29 - on all kinds of genres and very
01:31 - importantly all of this will be built
01:33 - whilst running good high quality clean
01:34 - code meaning that I will not be teaching
01:37 - you bad practices that you see in some
01:39 - beginner tutorials I will be teaching
01:41 - you how to write good high quality code
01:42 - and set up a good project structure the
01:45 - code in this course is on the same level
01:46 - of quality as my Steam games and my paid
01:48 - courses and the second reason is because
01:50 - the initial goal was to make a quick
01:52 - multiplayer course so I chose a design
01:54 - that could support multiple players but
01:56 - then of course I realized that people
01:58 - could be confused if I started from a
01:59 - pre-made game it would be tough to
02:01 - follow a multiplayer course if the code
02:03 - base was all new to you so then I
02:05 - decided to completely build this game
02:06 - from scratch in this massive free course
02:08 - and then afterwards I won't be
02:10 - publishing the second free course taking
02:12 - this game and making it multiplier
02:13 - ideally I wanted to publish both the
02:15 - single player and the multiplayer videos
02:17 - at the same time but I've been working
02:18 - like crazy and I'm only about to finish
02:20 - the single player portion so that
02:22 - multiplayer video is still going to take
02:24 - a little bit I'm hoping by the end of
02:26 - February since hopefully it should be
02:27 - simple now here's a quick overview of
02:30 - the entire course so first of all we're
02:32 - going to start coming from scratch by
02:34 - selecting a Unity version and creating a
02:36 - brand new project with that new project
02:38 - we will then learn all about the basics
02:40 - of the UNT interface and setup plane
02:42 - layout
02:43 - then the other important part is Visual
02:45 - Studio which is where we're going to be
02:47 - writing all of our code
02:48 - after that comes an extremely important
02:50 - lecture all about coding style in naming
02:52 - rules like I said the code in this
02:54 - course is on the same level of quality
02:55 - as my Steam games so having proper
02:57 - naming rules and good code sound is
02:59 - Paramount next we're going to download
03:01 - and import all the assets that we're
03:03 - going to use in the course everything is
03:05 - included so you can follow along with
03:06 - every step of the way
03:08 - with yes it's important we're going to
03:09 - set up some quick post processing just
03:11 - to make the game look good then for our
03:13 - first piece of logic we're going to make
03:15 - a simple character controller
03:17 - with that logic working we will then
03:19 - Implement a proper character visual with
03:21 - the included assets next we're going to
03:23 - learn the basics of animation and the
03:25 - animator component and with that we're
03:27 - going to make our player really come
03:28 - alive with some simple but really nice
03:30 - animations then we're going to install
03:32 - the cinemachine package this isn't
03:35 - actually used too much in this course
03:36 - but I still wanted to include it because
03:38 - it is such a useful tool so I do want
03:40 - you to know about it after that comes
03:42 - another extremely extremely important
03:44 - lecture with regards to running some
03:45 - good clean code we're going to do a nice
03:47 - refactor to replace the Legacy input
03:50 - manager with the brand new input system
03:52 - learning how to refactor is an extremely
03:54 - important and very valuable skill that
03:56 - will massively improve the quality of
03:58 - your code with that then we're going to
04:00 - implement some nice Collision detection
04:01 - to make sure our character doesn't want
04:03 - through walls
04:04 - next we're going to create the very
04:06 - first kitchen counter and make a script
04:08 - to handle how to interact with it then
04:10 - we're going to learn all about c-sharp
04:12 - events and create a proper interact
04:14 - input next we're going to build a
04:17 - selected counter visual which will
04:18 - require us to learn about the extremely
04:20 - useful Singleton pattern with the
04:22 - counters working we're going to start
04:24 - working on the kitchen objects
04:25 - themselves so these are going to be the
04:27 - ingredients and the plates we're going
04:29 - to use scriptable objects to Define all
04:31 - of the types
04:32 - then a very important part of our design
04:34 - is each kitchen object will have to be
04:36 - placed somewhere so we're going to take
04:38 - some time to really think about the best
04:40 - way to achieve that all while riding
04:42 - some good clean code next we're going to
04:44 - enable the player to pick up an object
04:46 - in doing so we're going to learn about
04:47 - c-sharp interfaces then we're going to
04:50 - make a container counter this is from
04:52 - where we can spawn new objects
04:54 - with that we will enable the player to
04:56 - pick up objects and drop them anywhere
04:58 - where there's space
04:59 - then we're going to make the cutting
05:01 - counter this one enables the player to
05:03 - cut an ingredient into slices so to do
05:06 - that we're going to make an alternate
05:08 - interaction
05:09 - and for handling the cutting we're going
05:11 - to once again use script more objects to
05:13 - define a proper cutting recipe
05:15 - then we're going to learn about a really
05:16 - awesome Unity feature we're on canvases
05:19 - and use that to display a nice progress
05:21 - Bar for our cutting progress after that
05:23 - is a quick lecture just going to make a
05:25 - very useful generic script to make any
05:27 - object look at the camera
05:29 - next for another counter we're going to
05:31 - build a trash bin this is where the
05:33 - player can drop objects to destroy them
05:35 - then the stove counter this one is going
05:37 - to be quite a bit complex we're going to
05:40 - create recipes for cooking and for
05:42 - burning we're going to learn how to make
05:44 - a basic state machine and handle timers
05:46 - next we're going to make the plates
05:48 - counter this is a simple encounter that
05:50 - just spawns a bunch of plates
05:52 - after that we're going to make some
05:53 - custom Logic on the plate to be able to
05:55 - hold other objects
05:57 - with that logic working we're going to
05:58 - build a complete visual for all the
06:00 - objects that can exist on the plate then
06:02 - make a nice UI element on the plate
06:04 - itself to showcase the icons of what
06:07 - exactly is on that plate afterwards
06:09 - we're going to make the very last
06:10 - counter the delivery counter this is
06:12 - where we drop the completed plates and
06:15 - in this lecture we're also going to
06:16 - learn about the entity graph and make a
06:18 - quick simple custom Shader then we're
06:21 - going to build the delivery manager
06:22 - class that generates the recipes that
06:24 - the customers are requesting next we're
06:26 - going to build a UI to showcase the
06:29 - wedding recipes after that comes
06:31 - something pretty crucial we're going to
06:32 - add some music and then add some sound
06:35 - effects for all kinds of game actions
06:37 - without the game won't be almost done so
06:40 - next we're going to build a proper game
06:41 - start and a game end then make a simple
06:44 - main menu and handle scene loading after
06:47 - that hand on creating a basic pause
06:49 - window
06:50 - then make an options menu enable the
06:52 - player to modify the audio levels and
06:54 - rebind keys
06:55 - after that we're going to enable menu
06:57 - navigation with a controller and in the
07:00 - end as usual comes the Polish stage so
07:02 - we're going to add all kinds of small
07:03 - tweaks and effects to make the game feel
07:05 - really great like I've said many times
07:07 - polish is what separates good games from
07:09 - great teams so as you can see building
07:11 - this game requires learning of tons of
07:13 - different systems so that makes this an
07:15 - excellent learning project that's great
07:17 - news whether you're a complete beginner
07:19 - or even if you're a more intermediate
07:21 - user again with a huge focus on writing
07:23 - good high quality clean code and some
07:25 - good project structure whatever your
07:27 - skill level I'm sure you will learn a
07:28 - ton from this course now I made decision
07:30 - to release this as a commonly free
07:32 - course in the end it ended up being a
07:34 - ton more worth than I initially planned
07:35 - but still I'm sticking with that
07:37 - decision
07:38 - obviously I could have made this AP
07:39 - course since it really is super high
07:41 - quality but I'm perfectly content with
07:43 - sticking with my original plan and
07:44 - making it free that way the course will
07:47 - hopefully reach many more people and
07:48 - help out anyone who wants to learn how
07:50 - to make games whether they have money or
07:52 - not so I'm perfectly okay with making
07:54 - this a free course all I want is for it
07:56 - to reach as many people as possible so
07:58 - like I said I need your help and the way
07:59 - you can help me is very simple next
08:01 - Monday when the video comes out and you
08:03 - see this thumbnail go ahead and click on
08:04 - it right away then click on the like
08:06 - button and just watch the video if you
08:09 - don't know how the YouTube algorithm
08:10 - works the main metrics are click-through
08:12 - rate watch time and likes so if you
08:14 - click on the thumbnail as soon as you
08:15 - see it then you watch the video for
08:17 - about 10 minutes and click the like
08:18 - button if that happens the video will
08:21 - have a high click-through rate a high
08:22 - view duration and high interactions
08:24 - which will signal to the YouTube
08:26 - algorithm to push the video that's
08:27 - really it by just doing those tiny
08:29 - actions it doesn't cost you anything and
08:31 - you won't be helping me a ton as well as
08:33 - helping all the people who will
08:34 - hopefully get this free high quality
08:35 - course suggested to them so that's it
08:37 - that's how you can help me the course
08:39 - won't be completely free for everyone
08:41 - but I did spend a bunch of money hiring
08:43 - a 3D artist musician sound designer and
08:45 - a bunch more I need to do that so that I
08:47 - had the right to distribute the assets
08:49 - so you can follow along
08:50 - so if you'd also like to help me at
08:52 - least break even on this project as
08:53 - usually you can pick up one of my
08:55 - regular paid courses if you're a
08:57 - beginner then watching this course and
08:58 - afterwards picking up the turn-based
09:00 - strategy course would be an excellent
09:01 - learning path
09:03 - that course is for more advanced users
09:05 - so it's a perfect follow-up for the free
09:06 - course alternatively My ultimate TNT
09:09 - overview course is very useful for
09:10 - anyone using Unity it has over 15
09:13 - lectures each covering a different two
09:14 - or more feature of the engine or if you
09:16 - prefer exploring making games with
09:18 - visual scripting I also have a course on
09:19 - that or you can learn how to make a nice
09:22 - build with Defender game and for this
09:23 - course the kitchen chaos game like I
09:25 - said the video is completely free
09:27 - although I will also make it a regular
09:29 - course on my website but I want to be
09:31 - very very clear there's absolutely no
09:33 - difference between the free and the paid
09:34 - version both have exactly the same
09:36 - content there is absolutely nothing
09:37 - behind the paywall I just made that just
09:39 - in case some of you find the course
09:40 - helpful and you can afford it and you'd
09:43 - like to support directly and of course
09:44 - the YouTube video has regular YouTube
09:46 - ads whether the paid version has no ads
09:48 - but all of the con is exactly the same
09:50 - so consider that essentially a donation
09:52 - for those of you who can't afford it
09:53 - either way I want to thank you all for
09:55 - being here watching the videos on this
09:57 - channel it's almost five years since I
09:59 - started doing this in total almost 700
10:01 - videos so this has been a crazy Journey
10:03 - thank you to all of you who have been
10:05 - here since the very beginning or even if
10:06 - you just joined recently this channel
10:08 - only exists because all of you watch the
10:10 - videos and of course a special thank you
10:12 - to all of the patreon supporters and
10:14 - channel members thank you if you've ever
10:16 - picked up one of my courses or bought my
10:18 - games or my asset or just bought
10:20 - anything through my film links it's only
10:22 - because of all of you that I can afford
10:24 - to dedicate three months of my life
10:25 - making a really awesome super high
10:27 - quality course that won't be completely
10:28 - free for everyone so once again thanks
10:30 - so much stay tuned for the video coming
10:32 - out on Monday and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and it's finally time I need your help with something for the past three months I've been working really hard on something truly special basically it's a complete phone course that I'm releasing here as a free YouTube video as usual the project scope got kind of out of hand the initial goal was to make a quick free two or three hour course well in the end it ended up being over 10 hours long so it took much longer to make but the great news is there's tons of awesome content for you to learn I even uploaded the game to Sims so you can right now go ahead onto the same page and add it to your wish list the game will launch at the same time as the course it's targeted at both complete beginners and more intermediate users it starts off really simple just focus on the basics and then over 45 lectures you will learn more and more complex things and the way that in your help is very simple when you see this video on your YouTube timeline or the suggest videos go ahead click on it right away then hit the like button and watch the video that's it I'll explain how that helps in a bit but first here's some detail on what the free course is all about out the game is a kitchen management game now I chose this design for two reasons one is because this actually involves quite a lot of systems which makes for a great learning project you will learn unity and csharp Basics how to make a character controller test for collisions and interact with objects how to use script long objects Shader graph and scene machine how to handle game logic spawning objects moving them using the new input system doing some Polish and tons more after following this course and learning all these techniques you will be able to build all kinds of games on all kinds of genres and very importantly all of this will be built whilst running good high quality clean code meaning that I will not be teaching you bad practices that you see in some beginner tutorials I will be teaching you how to write good high quality code and set up a good project structure the code in this course is on the same level of quality as my Steam games and my paid courses and the second reason is because the initial goal was to make a quick multiplayer course so I chose a design that could support multiple players but then of course I realized that people could be confused if I started from a premade game it would be tough to follow a multiplayer course if the code base was all new to you so then I decided to completely build this game from scratch in this massive free course and then afterwards I won't be publishing the second free course taking this game and making it multiplier ideally I wanted to publish both the single player and the multiplayer videos at the same time but I've been working like crazy and I'm only about to finish the single player portion so that multiplayer video is still going to take a little bit I'm hoping by the end of February since hopefully it should be simple now here's a quick overview of the entire course so first of all we're going to start coming from scratch by selecting a Unity version and creating a brand new project with that new project we will then learn all about the basics of the UNT interface and setup plane layout then the other important part is Visual Studio which is where we're going to be writing all of our code after that comes an extremely important lecture all about coding style in naming rules like I said the code in this course is on the same level of quality as my Steam games so having proper naming rules and good code sound is Paramount next we're going to download and import all the assets that we're going to use in the course everything is included so you can follow along with every step of the way with yes it's important we're going to set up some quick post processing just to make the game look good then for our first piece of logic we're going to make a simple character controller with that logic working we will then Implement a proper character visual with the included assets next we're going to learn the basics of animation and the animator component and with that we're going to make our player really come alive with some simple but really nice animations then we're going to install the cinemachine package this isn't actually used too much in this course but I still wanted to include it because it is such a useful tool so I do want you to know about it after that comes another extremely extremely important lecture with regards to running some good clean code we're going to do a nice refactor to replace the Legacy input manager with the brand new input system learning how to refactor is an extremely important and very valuable skill that will massively improve the quality of your code with that then we're going to implement some nice Collision detection to make sure our character doesn't want through walls next we're going to create the very first kitchen counter and make a script to handle how to interact with it then we're going to learn all about csharp events and create a proper interact input next we're going to build a selected counter visual which will require us to learn about the extremely useful Singleton pattern with the counters working we're going to start working on the kitchen objects themselves so these are going to be the ingredients and the plates we're going to use scriptable objects to Define all of the types then a very important part of our design is each kitchen object will have to be placed somewhere so we're going to take some time to really think about the best way to achieve that all while riding some good clean code next we're going to enable the player to pick up an object in doing so we're going to learn about csharp interfaces then we're going to make a container counter this is from where we can spawn new objects with that we will enable the player to pick up objects and drop them anywhere where there's space then we're going to make the cutting counter this one enables the player to cut an ingredient into slices so to do that we're going to make an alternate interaction and for handling the cutting we're going to once again use script more objects to define a proper cutting recipe then we're going to learn about a really awesome Unity feature we're on canvases and use that to display a nice progress Bar for our cutting progress after that is a quick lecture just going to make a very useful generic script to make any object look at the camera next for another counter we're going to build a trash bin this is where the player can drop objects to destroy them then the stove counter this one is going to be quite a bit complex we're going to create recipes for cooking and for burning we're going to learn how to make a basic state machine and handle timers next we're going to make the plates counter this is a simple encounter that just spawns a bunch of

on the plate then make a nice UI element on the plate itself to showcase the icons of what exactly is on that plate afterwards we're going to make the very last counter the delivery counter this is where we drop the completed plates and in this lecture we're also going to learn about the entity graph and make a quick simple custom Shader then we're going to build the delivery manager class that generates the recipes that the customers are requesting next we're going to build a UI to showcase the wedding recipes after that comes something pretty crucial we're going to add some music and then add some sound effects for all kinds of game actions without the game won't be almost done so next we're going to build a proper game start and a game end then make a simple main menu and handle scene loading after that hand on creating a basic pause window then make an options menu enable the player to modify the audio levels and rebind keys after that we're going to enable menu navigation with a controller and in the end as usual comes the Polish stage so we're going to add all kinds of small tweaks and effects to make the game feel really great like I've said many times polish is what separates good games from great teams so as you can see building this game requires learning of tons of different systems so that makes this an excellent learning project that's great news whether you're a complete beginner or even if you're a more intermediate user again with a huge focus on writing good high quality clean code and some good project structure whatever your skill level I'm sure you will learn a ton from this course now I made decision to release this as a commonly free course in the end it ended up being a ton more worth than I initially planned but still I'm sticking with that decision obviously I could have made this AP course since it really is super high quality but I'm perfectly content with sticking with my original plan and making it free that way the course will hopefully reach many more people and help out anyone who wants to learn how to make games whether they have money or not so I'm perfectly okay with making this a free course all I want is for it to reach as many people as possible so like I said I need your help and the way you can help me is very simple next Monday when the video comes out and you see this thumbnail go ahead and click on it right away then click on the like button and just watch the video if you don't know how the YouTube algorithm works the main metrics are clickthrough rate watch time and likes so if you click on the thumbnail as soon as you see it then you watch the video for about 10 minutes and click the like button if that happens the video will have a high clickthrough rate a high view duration and high interactions which will signal to the YouTube algorithm to push the video that's really it by just doing those tiny actions it doesn't cost you anything and you won't be helping me a ton as well as helping all the people who will hopefully get this free high quality course suggested to them so that's it that's how you can help me the course won't be completely free for everyone but I did spend a bunch of money hiring a 3D artist musician sound designer and a bunch more I need to do that so that I had the right to distribute the assets so you can follow along so if you'd also like to help me at least break even on this project as usually you can pick up one of my regular paid courses if you're a beginner then watching this course and afterwards picking up the turnbased strategy course would be an excellent learning path that course is for more advanced users so it's a perfect followup for the free course alternatively My ultimate TNT overview course is very useful for anyone using Unity it has over 15 lectures each covering a different two or more feature of the engine or if you prefer exploring making games with visual scripting I also have a course on that or you can learn how to make a nice build with Defender game and for this course the kitchen chaos game like I said the video is completely free although I will also make it a regular course on my website but I want to be very very clear there's absolutely no difference between the free and the paid version both have exactly the same content there is absolutely nothing behind the paywall I just made that just in case some of you find the course helpful and you can afford it and you'd like to support directly and of course the YouTube video has regular YouTube ads whether the paid version has no ads but all of the con is exactly the same so consider that essentially a donation for those of you who can't afford it either way I want to thank you all for being here watching the videos on this channel it's almost five years since I started doing this in total almost 700 videos so this has been a crazy Journey thank you to all of you who have been here since the very beginning or even if you just joined recently this channel only exists because all of you watch the videos and of course a special thank you to all of the patreon supporters and channel members thank you if you've ever picked up one of my courses or bought my games or my asset or just bought anything through my film links it's only because of all of you that I can afford to dedicate three months of my life making a really awesome super high quality course that won't be completely free for everyone so once again thanks so much stay tuned for the video coming out on Monday and I'll see you next time
