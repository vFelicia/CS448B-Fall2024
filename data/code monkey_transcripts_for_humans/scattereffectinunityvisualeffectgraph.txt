00:00 - in this video we're going to make a nice
00:01 - simple scanner effect using the visual
00:03 - effect graph
00:04 - we're going to take an image and convert
00:06 - it into a million particles and then
00:08 - scatter them
00:08 - let's begin
00:17 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:19 - and this channel is all about helping
00:20 - you learn how to make your own games
00:22 - with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:23 - professional indie game developer so if
00:25 - you find the video helpful consider
00:26 - subscribing okay so what we're going to
00:29 - make here is a very simple but very
00:31 - interesting effect
00:32 - using the visual effect graph now if
00:34 - you're not familiar with it then first
00:35 - go check out the getting started video
00:37 - right now here i have my simple logo so
00:40 - just a normal image
00:41 - and now i press a key and yep there it
00:43 - goes the
00:44 - logo gets converted into a milling
00:46 - particles and the particles all scatter
00:47 - away
00:48 - now this effect works with any texture
00:51 - so here it is with a different texture
00:53 - and i press space and if there you go it
00:55 - works exactly the same
00:56 - so the image gets converted into a
00:58 - million particles and they all scatter
00:59 - away in a very nice satisfying way
01:02 - so this is a very good looking effect
01:03 - that you can easily apply to your own
01:05 - games when you show your studio's logo
01:08 - this video's patreon sponsor is bad
01:10 - adventure bad
01:11 - adventure is a game development duo
01:13 - currently working on their first game
01:15 - wayfarers edge
01:16 - it's a rpg focused on exploring and
01:18 - settling unknown frontierlands in a low
01:20 - fantasy and wild west theme
01:22 - check them out at badadventure.com thank
01:25 - you to the patreon sponsor and thank you
01:26 - to these awesome supporters for making
01:28 - this video possible
01:29 - go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get
01:32 - some perks and help keep the videos free
01:34 - for everyone
01:35 - all right so this is our goal let's get
01:37 - to it
01:38 - okay so here we are in an empty scene so
01:41 - let's begin
01:42 - by going to our project files and create
01:44 - a new visual effect and a new visual
01:46 - effect graph
01:47 - let's call this our scatter effect
01:51 - and just drag it onto our scene yep
01:53 - there's the default effect
01:54 - now let's double click to open up the
01:56 - visual effect graph
01:58 - and just drag it in there
02:03 - alright here it is now in order to make
02:05 - this effect there's pretty much just one
02:07 - thing that we're going to need
02:09 - we're going to need to create a point
02:11 - cache from one of our textures
02:12 - so first of all what is exactly a point
02:14 - cache now a point cache is a simple way
02:17 - of storing a bunch of data for each
02:19 - point
02:19 - so in this case we're going to store the
02:21 - position and the color of each pixel
02:23 - now to create our point cache we already
02:25 - have a tool that's included that we can
02:27 - use
02:27 - so go into window and then down here
02:30 - onto visual effects
02:31 - onto utilities and we have the point
02:33 - cache bait tool so here this works also
02:35 - with meshes but in this case we're going
02:37 - to use a texture
02:38 - and let me drag the code monkey head
02:40 - texture and now also make sure to take
02:42 - this one to export the colors
02:44 - and that's pretty much it so just save
02:47 - and now here you might see this error
02:49 - message
02:50 - so it's saying that the texture is not
02:51 - readable so if that happens
02:53 - just select the texture go into the
02:55 - inspector to visualize the import
02:57 - settings
02:58 - and in here make sure you take the read
02:59 - write enabled so just tick this
03:01 - hit save and now we can indeed save our
03:03 - point cache and yep there it is here in
03:05 - our project files we can see our point
03:07 - cache
03:08 - storing the point data for our logo
03:09 - texture so this is what we're going to
03:11 - use for our particles
03:12 - so back in our vfx graph in here let's
03:15 - first
03:16 - grab our point cache so on an empty
03:18 - space and here
03:19 - let's just press space and now let's
03:21 - search for point cache and yep there you
03:23 - go
03:24 - and in here just drag our point cache
03:26 - right in there and yep there you go it
03:27 - automatically loads with the data that
03:29 - we saved
03:30 - so we have the point count which is the
03:32 - total number of points in the point
03:33 - cache
03:34 - we have the position which is the
03:35 - position of each point and the color
03:37 - which is the color of each point
03:38 - so let's begin by setting our position
03:41 - so here on the initialize
03:43 - let's get rid of the velocity and let's
03:46 - set a static
03:47 - lifetime so in here press space first of
03:50 - all for the set
03:51 - lifetime so it's set to a fixed value
03:54 - and now we're going to add a block and
03:55 - now let's search for position from map
03:58 - and if there is set position from map
04:00 - then we also have a
04:02 - color from map set column for map yep
04:04 - and now we just need to connect these so
04:06 - connect the position onto that attribute
04:08 - map and the color width down
04:10 - so in there we can see our particles
04:11 - spawning at different positions
04:13 - in our position we can modify the scale
04:15 - in order to get the object to be bigger
04:17 - so just like this now they're spawning
04:18 - more all over the place now for the
04:20 - color we need to apply the color onto a
04:22 - normal white texture so let's go down
04:24 - here
04:25 - and we're going to replace the default
04:26 - particle instead let's select the
04:28 - default particle system particle
04:30 - then let's modify the set size over life
04:32 - instead of the particles increasing in
04:34 - size let's make them decrease
04:38 - so they start at a certain size and then
04:39 - go down okay and finally on the set
04:41 - color over life instead of changing the
04:43 - color and the alpha let's only modify
04:45 - the alpha
04:46 - and here in the gradient let's start off
04:48 - at full alpha and then after a while it
04:50 - goes down to zero all right
04:51 - now if we go up here and we massively
04:54 - increase our capacity and our spawn rate
04:58 - just like that yep we can already see
05:00 - the logo being created
05:02 - so you can see how each particle takes
05:03 - on a position and a color from the point
05:06 - cache
05:06 - now we can actually visualize how the
05:08 - point cache is working so in here
05:09 - instead of random constant per particle
05:11 - let's choose sequential and do the same
05:14 - thing in here for the color
05:16 - and if there you go now you can see how
05:17 - the logo is being pretty much
05:19 - printed line by line so that's how all
05:21 - the data is stored inside of the point
05:23 - cache
05:24 - so if we increase this then we have a
05:26 - very interesting effect
05:36 - if there it is look at that interesting
05:38 - effect all right but this is not exactly
05:40 - what we want
05:41 - we want all of our particles to be
05:43 - spawned only once
05:44 - so instead of a constant spawn rate
05:46 - let's disable this one and we're going
05:47 - to press space
05:49 - and we're going to add a burst let's go
05:52 - with a single burst
05:53 - so this will spawn this many particles
05:55 - as soon as it only is over so if it's
05:57 - zero it's red as soon as the effect
05:59 - starts and now in here for the count
06:01 - which is the amount of particles
06:03 - we can use exactly the same number as
06:05 - the number of points that we have in our
06:06 - point cache
06:08 - so just like that yep you saw that they
06:09 - all spawned exactly at the start
06:12 - so as soon as the effect activates it
06:13 - will spawn off the particles at once and
06:15 - after their
06:16 - lifetime then they simply vanish so
06:18 - that's exactly what we want
06:20 - but in here if we put just a single
06:22 - burst then we constantly have to go back
06:24 - into the scene in order to select it and
06:25 - do play again
06:26 - in order to reset the effect so just for
06:29 - testing we can also add
06:31 - a periodic burst and here we do the same
06:33 - thing so
06:34 - connect the same point count and set a
06:36 - delay for two seconds
06:37 - so every two seconds this will refresh
06:40 - this way we can easily continue working
06:41 - on our effect and in the end we just
06:42 - need to disable it and leave this single
06:44 - burst
06:45 - alright so now that the particles are
06:46 - all being spawned in the correct
06:48 - position with the right color
06:49 - now we just need to make them vanish so
06:52 - right now they are simply
06:53 - reducing in size and lowering the alpha
06:55 - so this is not really a very interesting
06:57 - effect it looks exactly the same as the
06:59 - normal texture
07:00 - so on our update down here we're going
07:03 - to add
07:04 - a simple block so let's press space
07:06 - another block
07:07 - let's write force and in here we have
07:10 - two main options
07:12 - we can add some turbulence or a vector
07:14 - field force
07:15 - let's start off with the turbulence and
07:17 - if just like that you can already see
07:18 - the effect in action so everything moves
07:20 - around
07:20 - very randomly now let's play around
07:22 - these values
07:32 - all right so just like this it already
07:33 - looks quite interesting so the particles
07:35 - spawn in a scatter way
07:37 - so it looks good but it's a bit too
07:39 - random now let's try out applying the
07:41 - second method
07:42 - so let's disable this one and let's
07:44 - apply let's search for force and select
07:46 - the vector field force
07:48 - now the vfx ref already has a vector
07:50 - field with a bunch of randomness
07:52 - now a vector field is essentially just a
07:54 - 3d cube made up of voxels and each of
07:57 - them
07:57 - has a certain vector i covered vector
07:59 - films in more detail in the
08:01 - video where we did a deep dive on the
08:03 - effect covering the unity logo
08:05 - so if you want to learn more then look
08:07 - at that one but essentially it's just a
08:08 - 3d field with a vector on each position
08:11 - so
08:12 - using that we can get a bit more of an
08:14 - interesting look
08:22 - alright so here i played around with it
08:24 - with the fields
08:25 - now for the vector field i actually use
08:27 - the one included in the efficient
08:28 - samples
08:29 - so i find that this one has a bit less
08:30 - randomness it looks a bit better
08:33 - than just playing around with the size
08:34 - the position the intensity drag and so
08:36 - on
08:36 - and yup here is the final effect so it's
08:39 - a bit less random and a bit more flowy
08:41 - which i think looks better
08:42 - and if you want you can use both effects
08:44 - at once so just click this
08:46 - and yet there you go how the particles
08:48 - all scatter in different directions
08:50 - with a bit of flow and a bit of
08:51 - randomness so since this is based on a
08:53 - vector field you could also create your
08:55 - own to get the exact flow shape you like
08:57 - so this one is going pretty random since
08:59 - we're using a random vector field
09:01 - but we can make something with a
09:02 - specific wave like moving upwards moving
09:04 - down and so on
09:05 - all right so just like this pretty much
09:07 - we have our effect working
09:09 - now all we need to do is just link this
09:10 - up with an image
09:12 - so for that let's just drag the texture
09:14 - onto our scene
09:15 - and now to make sure that the size is
09:16 - exactly correct let's disable these
09:20 - updates
09:29 - all right so here just playing around
09:30 - the scale in order to make sure that
09:31 - they both have the exact same size
09:33 - so here we can see the image slightly
09:35 - transparent with the particle spawn
09:36 - right on top
09:38 - now to get the effect that we want all
09:39 - we need is for the image to hide itself
09:41 - just as soon as the particles get
09:42 - spawned
09:44 - so for handling that animation we can
09:46 - use a simple timeline
09:48 - so let's create the game object for our
09:50 - timeline
09:51 - so let's go into window then into
09:53 - sequencing and here we open the timeline
09:55 - window
09:59 - so now here just hit on create now let's
10:02 - drag the sprite to animate it
10:05 - so let's start recording then select the
10:07 - sprite and set the alpha to
10:09 - phone alpha then let's go after a bit
10:12 - and set the alpha down to zero
10:14 - so just like that the alpha starts off
10:16 - high and becomes low just like that
10:18 - and then we drag our scatter effect and
10:20 - let's make it a visual effect activation
10:22 - track
10:24 - and in here let's add a visual effect
10:26 - activation clip
10:28 - so the clip activates as soon as we
10:30 - enter this one and now we can go back
10:32 - into our scatter effect
10:34 - and down here disable the periodic so we
10:36 - only leave the single burst
10:40 - now in here we just have to match up
10:41 - these two
10:49 - all right so just like that so we'll
10:51 - lower the alpha on our image
10:52 - and we activate our actual effect so
10:55 - that's pretty much it
10:56 - over here in the project files i have
10:58 - this simple script all it does is it
11:00 - listens to the space bar
11:01 - and when so then we start playing our
11:03 - timeline so just add the script onto it
11:05 - alright so here it is start off with the
11:07 - normal image now press space
11:09 - and yep there goes our nice logo so the
11:11 - logo gets converted into a million
11:13 - particles and they all scatter away
11:15 - so here is the complete effect
11:18 - and as you saw this is all based on
11:20 - creating a simple point cache so you can
11:22 - make this work with any texture
11:24 - all right so here it is with a different
11:25 - logo again just press space
11:28 - and yep there you go everything gets
11:29 - converted into particles and they all
11:30 - flow away
11:32 - it all works based on a simple point
11:33 - cache so you can create that from any
11:36 - texture or any mesh
11:37 - and the scatter is also based on a
11:39 - vector field which again you can also
11:40 - make a custom one to get the exact flow
11:42 - that you want
11:43 - so for example this is a great very
11:45 - simple effect that you can add when your
11:46 - game starts and your logo shows up

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to make a nice simple scanner effect using the visual effect graph we're going to take an image and convert it into a million particles and then scatter them let's begin hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so what we're going to make here is a very simple but very interesting effect using the visual effect graph now if you're not familiar with it then first go check out the getting started video right now here i have my simple logo so just a normal image and now i press a key and yep there it goes the logo gets converted into a milling particles and the particles all scatter away now this effect works with any texture so here it is with a different texture and i press space and if there you go it works exactly the same so the image gets converted into a million particles and they all scatter away in a very nice satisfying way so this is a very good looking effect that you can easily apply to your own games when you show your studio's logo this video's patreon sponsor is bad adventure bad adventure is a game development duo currently working on their first game wayfarers edge it's a rpg focused on exploring and settling unknown frontierlands in a low fantasy and wild west theme check them out at badadventure.com thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone all right so this is our goal let's get to it okay so here we are in an empty scene so let's begin by going to our project files and create a new visual effect and a new visual effect graph let's call this our scatter effect and just drag it onto our scene yep there's the default effect now let's double click to open up the visual effect graph and just drag it in there alright here it is now in order to make this effect there's pretty much just one thing that we're going to need we're going to need to create a point cache from one of our textures so first of all what is exactly a point cache now a point cache is a simple way of storing a bunch of data for each point so in this case we're going to store the position and the color of each pixel now to create our point cache we already have a tool that's included that we can use so go into window and then down here onto visual effects onto utilities and we have the point cache bait tool so here this works also with meshes but in this case we're going to use a texture and let me drag the code monkey head texture and now also make sure to take this one to export the colors and that's pretty much it so just save and now here you might see this error message so it's saying that the texture is not readable so if that happens just select the texture go into the inspector to visualize the import settings and in here make sure you take the read write enabled so just tick this hit save and now we can indeed save our point cache and yep there it is here in our project files we can see our point cache storing the point data for our logo texture so this is what we're going to use for our particles so back in our vfx graph in here let's first grab our point cache so on an empty space and here let's just press space and now let's search for point cache and yep there you go and in here just drag our point cache right in there and yep there you go it automatically loads with the data that we saved so we have the point count which is the total number of points in the point cache we have the position which is the position of each point and the color which is the color of each point so let's begin by setting our position so here on the initialize let's get rid of the velocity and let's set a static lifetime so in here press space first of all for the set lifetime so it's set to a fixed value and now we're going to add a block and now let's search for position from map and if there is set position from map then we also have a color from map set column for map yep and now we just need to connect these so connect the position onto that attribute map and the color width down so in there we can see our particles spawning at different positions in our position we can modify the scale in order to get the object to be bigger so just like this now they're spawning more all over the place now for the color we need to apply the color onto a normal white texture so let's go down here and we're going to replace the default particle instead let's select the default particle system particle then let's modify the set size over life instead of the particles increasing in size let's make them decrease so they start at a certain size and then go down okay and finally on the set color over life instead of changing the color and the alpha let's only modify the alpha and here in the gradient let's start off at full alpha and then after a while it goes down to zero all right now if we go up here and we massively increase our capacity and our spawn rate just like that yep we can already see the logo being created so you can see how each particle takes on a position and a color from the point cache now we can actually visualize how the point cache is working so in here instead of random constant per particle let's choose sequential and do the same thing in here for the color and if there you go now you can see how the logo is being pretty much printed line by line so that's how all the data is stored inside of the point cache so if we increase this then we have a very interesting effect if there it is look at that interesting effect all right but this is not exactly what we want we want all of our particles to be spawned only once so instead of a constant spawn rate let's disable this one and we're going to press space and we're going to add a burst let's go with a single burst so this will spawn this many particles as soon as it only is over so if it's zero it's red as soon as the effect starts and now in here for the count which is the amount of particles we can use exactly the same number as the number of points that we have in our point cache so just like that yep you saw that they all spawned exactly at the start so as soon as the effect activates it will spawn off the particles at once and after their lifetime then they simply vanish so that's exactly what we want but in here if we put just a single burst then we constantly have to go back into the scene in order to select it and do play again in order to reset the effect so just for testing we can also add a periodic burst and here we do the same thing so connect the same point count and set a delay for two seconds so every two seconds this will refresh this way we can easily continue working on our effect and in the end we just need to disable it and leave this single burst alright so now that the particles are all being spawned in the correct position with the right color now we just need to make them vanish so right now they are simply reducing in size and lowering the alpha so this is not really a very interesting effect it looks exactly the same as the normal texture so on our update down here we're going to add a simple block so let's press space another block let's write force and in here we have two main options we can add some turbulence or a vector field force let's start off with the turbulence and if just like that you can already see the effect in action so everything moves around very randomly now let's play around these values all right so just like this it already looks quite interesting so the particles spawn in a scatter way so it looks good but it's a bit too random now let's try out applying the second method so let's disable this one and let's apply let's search for force and select the vector field force now the vfx ref already has a vector field with a bunch of randomness now a vector field is essentially just a 3d cube made up of voxels and each of them has a certain vector i covered vector films in more detail in the video where we did a deep dive on the effect covering the unity logo so if you want to learn more then look at that one but essentially it's just a 3d field with a vector on each position so using that we can get a bit more of an interesting look alright so here i played around with it with the fields now for the vector field i actually use the one included in the efficient samples so i find that this one has a bit less randomness it looks a bit better than just playing around with the size the position the intensity drag and so on and yup here is the final effect so it's a bit less random and a bit more flowy which i think looks better and if you want you can use both effects at once so just click this and yet there you go how the particles all scatter in different directions with a bit of flow and a bit of randomness so since this is based on a vector field you could also create your own to get the exact flow shape you like so this one is going pretty random since we're using a random vector field but we can make something with a specific wave like moving upwards moving down and so on all right so just like this pretty much we have our effect working now all we need to do is just link this up with an image so for that let's just drag the texture onto our scene and now to make sure that the size is exactly correct let's disable these updates all right so here just playing around the scale in order to make sure that they both have the exact same size so here we can see the image slightly transparent with the particle spawn right on top now to get the effect that we want all we need is for the image to hide itself just as soon as the particles get spawned so for handling that animation we can use a simple timeline so let's create the game object for our timeline so let's go into window then into sequencing and here we open the timeline window so now here just hit on create now let's drag the sprite to animate it so let's start recording then select the sprite and set the alpha to phone alpha then let's go after a bit and set the alpha down to zero so just like that the alpha starts off high and becomes low just like that and then we drag our scatter effect and let's make it a visual effect activation track and in here let's add a visual effect activation clip so the clip activates as soon as we enter this one and now we can go back into our scatter effect and down here disable the periodic so we only leave the single burst now in here we just have to match up these two all right so just like that so we'll lower the alpha on our image and we activate our actual effect so that's pretty much it over here in the project files i have this simple script all it does is it listens to the space bar and when so then we start playing our timeline so just add the script onto it alright so here it is start off with the normal image now press space and yep there goes our nice logo so the logo gets converted into a million particles and they all scatter away so here is the complete effect and as you saw this is all based on creating a simple point cache so you can make this work with any texture all right so here it is with a different logo again just press space and yep there you go everything gets converted into particles and they all flow away it all works based on a simple point cache so you can create that from any texture or any mesh and the scatter is also based on a vector field which again you can also make a custom one to get the exact flow that you want so for example this is a great very simple effect that you can add when your game starts and your logo shows up this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some
