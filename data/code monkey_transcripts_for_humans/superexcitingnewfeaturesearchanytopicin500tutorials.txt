00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and i finally added a super useful
00:04 - feature on the website that i've been
00:05 - meaning to get done for a long time so
00:07 - the website now has a search bar this is
00:09 - a small thing but it's actually quite
00:10 - useful
00:11 - we are now entering into may of 22 and i
00:14 - started this channel four years ago in
00:15 - may of 2018 the first video tutorial on
00:18 - the channel was the health system video
00:20 - published on the 15th of may of 2018 my
00:23 - presentation back then was definitely
00:24 - pretty bad but the code is solid in fact
00:26 - just two months ago i actually made my
00:28 - second free asset which is a really
00:30 - robust health system where the core of
00:32 - it is based on that very first video
00:34 - which in turn is also based on the
00:36 - health system that i've used in pretty
00:37 - much all of my steam games going all the
00:39 - way back to survivor squad in 2013. so
00:41 - anyways in these four years i've made
00:43 - over 500 videos on this channel tons of
00:45 - tutorials on all kinds of topics and
00:47 - most of them are step-by-step tutorials
00:49 - since that has always been my main focus
00:50 - on the channel basically my goal when i
00:52 - started was sharing the knowledge that
00:54 - i've accumulated in this past 10 years
00:56 - of working with unity and making several
00:58 - indie games published on steam so i've
00:59 - made tons of tutorials on tons of topics
01:02 - however the way that youtube works is it
01:04 - mostly only promotes recent videos so if
01:06 - you just found the channel recently then
01:08 - chances are there's lots of videos that
01:10 - i've already made that could be super
01:11 - useful to you but you might not ever see
01:13 - them at the same time i've also got tons
01:15 - of topics that i've yet to cover so i
01:17 - prioritize covering new topics rather
01:18 - than remaking old videos for example i
01:20 - already made a pretty robust top-down 2d
01:23 - character controller two years ago
01:25 - i made a video on my four-step process
01:28 - for solving non-reference exceptions
01:30 - i've covered the basics of converting
01:31 - between 2d and 3d i covered all about
01:34 - c-sharp interfaces generics and events
01:37 - so all those videos which contain tons
01:39 - of useful information they already exist
01:41 - so i'm not planning on covering those
01:42 - topics again anytime soon and that's
01:44 - where this search bar comes in
01:46 - it's right here on the main page and you
01:48 - can just search for anything like for
01:49 - example c sharp and over here you can
01:51 - see tons of c-sharp related videos that
01:53 - i've already done so there's one for
01:55 - quickly learning the basics how to fix
01:56 - non-reference exception what are
01:58 - interfaces delegates generics loops
02:00 - events and so on tons of stuff or
02:02 - perhaps you want to search for some
02:04 - editor tools so search for editor
02:06 - there you go how to create custom
02:08 - editors then a specific use case for a
02:10 - more dynamic editor capturing mouse
02:12 - clicks and so on how to show private
02:14 - variables in the inspector or a custom
02:16 - class have multiple inspectors and so on
02:18 - on the main page i also added these
02:20 - quick buttons for a bunch of quick
02:21 - searches for some interesting topics
02:23 - like for example over here all the
02:25 - videos that i've made on the grid system
02:27 - so tons of stuff then a whole bunch of
02:29 - videos on marketing covering lots of
02:31 - interesting things then a bunch of
02:33 - shader videos and a ton of videos
02:34 - related to my latest game battleground
02:36 - tycoon
02:37 - so as you can see tons of videos on tons
02:39 - of topics that i've already made
02:40 - previously and if you're new here
02:42 - chances are there's some that i've made
02:43 - that could be super useful to you but
02:45 - since they were made quite a long time
02:46 - ago youtube won't show them to you
02:48 - automatically i normally tag my videos
02:50 - with some relevant keywords when i
02:51 - upload them to the website so searching
02:53 - over here might be better than using
02:55 - youtube search and also since i'm
02:56 - talking about the website another
02:58 - website update that i made quite a while
02:59 - ago but maybe you don't know about if
03:01 - you log in and you go into your user
03:03 - page over here you can see tons of
03:05 - options these are email notifications so
03:07 - if you don't like being dependent on the
03:09 - youtube algorithm recommending videos
03:11 - then you can just toggle any of these
03:12 - options and you'll get one of these
03:14 - automated emails there's also over here
03:16 - links to see examples of these emails
03:18 - for example the monthly email contains
03:20 - some tags on what happened that month
03:22 - along with any current news and events
03:23 - and a few video highlights then the
03:26 - weekly email is a simple list of all the
03:28 - videos for that week the new video email
03:30 - is exactly what it sounds like just a
03:32 - simple email as soon as the video is
03:33 - live
03:34 - then announcements basically whenever i
03:36 - have a new course or new asset or a new
03:38 - game or anything i send one of these out
03:40 - then the live stream you can get an
03:41 - email a few minutes before i go live my
03:44 - live streams don't really have any set
03:45 - schedule i do them whenever i have
03:47 - something to do that would fit on a live
03:48 - stream
03:49 - and finally the asset sales so whenever
03:51 - an interesting sale happens sometimes i
03:53 - don't make a full video on it but i
03:55 - might send one of these emails so that's
03:56 - just a nice simple feature on the
03:58 - website i made it since i was watching
04:00 - so many comments from people who didn't
04:01 - get notified of new videos so if you
04:03 - don't want to be dependent on the
04:04 - youtube algorithm then i would suggest
04:06 - you enable at least over here the
04:08 - monthly newsletter so you get a nice
04:09 - email once per month and also the weekly
04:11 - one just in case youtube doesn't
04:13 - recommend a certain video so you can
04:14 - quickly see everything that came out
04:16 - that week then the other ones if you
04:17 - want just take them all and hit on save
04:19 - preferences and also since i'm on this
04:21 - page there's over here the character
04:23 - customization you can change the skin
04:25 - color the hair color the hair the beard
04:27 - the body and so on or you can even
04:29 - download the base texture then over here
04:31 - you can draw on top of all these places
04:33 - and then you can import your own custom
04:35 - texture and then your character will
04:36 - show up just like this on the live
04:37 - stream i definitely would like to do
04:39 - some more live streams it's always fun
04:40 - to do some work live and answer all your
04:42 - questions although i haven't done one in
04:44 - about two months the reason for that is
04:46 - simply because i'm hard at work at my
04:48 - turn-based strategy course and if you're
04:50 - interested in that there's also a link
04:51 - where you can sign up if you want to be
04:53 - notified when the course is out i've got
04:55 - the course fully written and i'm
04:56 - starting to record it so hopefully it
04:58 - should be done by around mid to late may
05:00 - alright so that's it just a quick video
05:02 - showcasing a nice new feature on the
05:03 - website and some other ones if you're a
05:05 - recent viewer of the channel check out
05:06 - that search bar chances are you might
05:08 - find some older videos that i've done
05:09 - that would be super useful to you right
05:11 - now
05:12 - alright hope that's useful check out
05:14 - these videos to learn some more thanks
05:16 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
05:17 - making these videos possible thank you
05:19 - for watching and i'll see you next time
05:25 - [Music]
05:28 - you
