01:37 - high frame rate really satisfying next
01:39 - here is a spooky high quality character
01:41 - I really like design on this one the
01:43 - weapon attached to the arm and the Maze
01:45 - Lantern thingy it's a super high quality
01:47 - character with a bunch of animations so
01:49 - if your game has some kind of Dark
01:50 - Fantasy medieval style then this would
01:52 - be a perfect enemy then if you're making
01:54 - a retro game here is a nice UI pack it's
01:56 - got tons of icons bars buttons and lots
01:59 - of elements all of it in a really nice
02:00 - pixel art Zone then if you need some
02:02 - projectiles and explosions check out
02:04 - this one looks really good as always
02:05 - it's up to you to decide what the
02:07 - Commerce represent you can go really
02:08 - crazy with the colors to get some really
02:10 - unique effects next here is an
02:11 - interesting one it's a Historical Museum
02:13 - super high quality very detailed meshes
02:16 - a bunch of interesting dinosaurs so this
02:18 - would be a perfect level for a game I
02:20 - can imagine some kind of mystery
02:22 - Adventure game or maybe you could even
02:23 - take this into modular pieces and make
02:25 - some kind of level just like Doom then
02:27 - if you need some cute aliens here is a
02:29 - nice pack I really like this Dev they've
02:30 - got tons of really cute characters in
02:32 - fact the two main characters for my
02:34 - upcoming game come from this the dinky
02:36 - and the zoomy by the way go ahead and
02:37 - add dinky garnish your wish list one
02:39 - thing that I love about these packs is
02:40 - how all these characters they all have
02:42 - multiple Evolutions which would make
02:44 - this pack perfect for some kind of
02:45 - pokemon-like game or really just
02:47 - anything where you have multiple enemy
02:49 - difficulties next for some World
02:50 - building here's a great looking one it's
02:52 - a town Worm but it's in 3D I really like
02:55 - how all of the modular pieces match
02:56 - together based on design this really
02:58 - reminds me of the old school TS is kind
03:00 - of like Command and Conquer or Age of
03:02 - Empires those usually had some really
03:04 - high Cliffs with some very invisible and
03:05 - walkable areas or maybe just need some
03:07 - swords if so here's a mass effect with
03:09 - over 200 you've got some normal ones
03:11 - some very weird ones definitely tons of
03:13 - variety this style is somewhat cartoony
03:15 - and would fit perfectly with so many
03:17 - other packs now of course if you have
03:19 - swords you need sword animations then
03:20 - check out this one features over 80
03:22 - animations of a character wielding a
03:24 - giant very heavy sword so all of these
03:26 - animations of the attacks feel really
03:28 - weighty and Powerful there are some
03:30 - regular attacks a bunch of movement and
03:31 - some really flashy finishers then here's
03:34 - a fun one over 300 food and ingredient
03:36 - icons it's got a really nice cozy style
03:38 - this would be perfect for some kind of
03:40 - Star Event like you've got some toes
03:42 - candy carrots drinks coffee some donuts
03:45 - and so much more next if you need some
03:47 - magic circle let's check out this one
03:48 - again it's up to you to decide what all
03:50 - these mean there are some that look very
03:52 - hilly and very angelical and some don't
03:54 - look very dark in their welcome all of
03:56 - them are really nice looking very
03:58 - complex you could obviously scale them
03:59 - up down to match whatever AOE or R
04:02 - spells you have then if you need a
04:03 - really gorgeous looking Sunrise
04:04 - environment check out this one it looks
04:06 - really great I love the style very
04:08 - inviting it's a nice Outdoors area with
04:10 - some tents there's a nice River and lots
04:12 - of trees so this one is obviously
04:14 - perfect for making some kind of game
04:16 - inspired by firewatch then if you need
04:17 - some generic sci-fi characters check out
04:19 - these ones they definitely look very
04:21 - sci-fi some shiny elements and armor
04:23 - with a bunch of colors so this could be
04:25 - great for a realistic multiplayer game
04:27 - for something more chill here is a
04:28 - farming pack it's got a nice low poly
04:30 - style tons of props and objects really
04:32 - anything you can find in the Farm is
04:34 - here there are tons of plants and
04:35 - footstuffs in various growing stages
04:37 - lots of vehicles characters trailers and
04:39 - a bunch more then if your game has a
04:41 - cute companion look at this one some
04:43 - very cute tiny characters others like
04:45 - sci-fi elements others like robots in
04:47 - total almost 150 prefabs or for
04:49 - something to suddenly unless cute here
04:51 - is a demon dog very spooky and looking
04:53 - very zombie-like this one is made by
04:55 - Infinity PBR so as always it has tons of
04:57 - Sliders for you to customize it in any
04:59 - way you want next if your game has some
05:01 - building check out this one for me I'm
05:03 - with packs that have variations of
05:05 - multiple construction sages and this one
05:06 - has exactly that so you can see this
05:08 - being perfect for some kind of strategy
05:10 - game I can imagine just some villagers
05:12 - walking around hitting emmers as you
05:14 - spawn the buildings so great starting
05:15 - point for a nice RTS or something like
05:17 - that then for a very Niche one here are
05:19 - a bunch of paper plane models perhaps
05:21 - more impressive is I didn't know you
05:23 - could make all of these planes I only
05:25 - know how to make the standard one they
05:27 - all have separate body parts so you can
05:28 - easily animate them or maybe if your
05:30 - game is 2D here is a pack with a bunch
05:32 - of monsters it's some really nice pixel
05:34 - art I quite like the white outline makes
05:36 - it kind of one of my stickers I can see
05:38 - this pack being used in some kind of
05:40 - sideways turn-based strategy game with
05:42 - some basic animations for the attacks or
05:43 - perhaps for something more cozy here are
05:45 - some nice kitchens and props personally
05:47 - I love dioramas just like this they
05:49 - always look really nice so you can like
05:51 - to make some kind of decorating game or
05:53 - something like the Sims then this would
