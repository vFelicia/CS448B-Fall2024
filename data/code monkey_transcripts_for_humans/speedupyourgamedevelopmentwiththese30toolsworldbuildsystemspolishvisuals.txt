With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - as you know the ssor has tons of awesome
00:04 - tools and assets to help you in every
00:06 - way imaginable there's so much awesome
00:07 - stuff that it's impossible to keep track
00:09 - of it all so here let's look at about 20
00:11 - assets that can help you massively speed
00:13 - up development of your game and get
00:14 - something playable super quickly or just
00:16 - help you polish whatever you already
00:18 - have i organized all these assets into
00:20 - six distinct categories to help you in
00:22 - different ways i chose to highlight so
00:24 - many assets because there's lots of
00:26 - super useful ones but whether or not
00:28 - they are useful will depend on what kind
00:29 - of game and what genre you're making so
00:31 - regardless of the genre i'm sure that
00:33 - several of these 20 that i'm going to
00:35 - highlight can be a great help to you in
00:37 - speeding up development of your game and
00:38 - helping finish whatever project you're
00:40 - currently working on also this video is
00:42 - sponsored by unity okay so let's see how
00:44 - the ssr can help you speed up
00:46 - development i organized all of these
00:48 - assets into six discrete categories
00:50 - there's timestamps in the video and all
00:52 - of the assets are linked in the
00:53 - description quick mention unity right
00:55 - now is having a sale in a bunch of the
00:56 - assets mentioned in this video are on
00:58 - sale until next week then when this one
01:00 - ends there's another sale with even more
01:02 - assets discounted and in the last week
01:04 - the best of both sales will again get a
01:06 - discount so check the links below and if
01:08 - it's not on sale check again next week
01:10 - and make sure you use the coupon to get
01:12 - a bonus discount up to 15 percent more
01:14 - let's begin just briefly with the
01:15 - simplest most obvious category which are
01:17 - visual assets these are 3d models
01:20 - textures animations effects ui elements
01:22 - skyboxes and possibly even custom
01:24 - shaders for me as someone who has pretty
01:26 - much no artistic skill for me this is
01:28 - one of the main ways that i use the
01:29 - store so in my case it's more due to
01:32 - lack of skills rather than wanting to
01:33 - speed up development but even if you are
01:35 - a talented 3d modeler or animator it can
01:37 - still save you a ton of time to just buy
01:39 - something instead of building everything
01:41 - from scratch if you're a regular on the
01:43 - channel then you've certainly noticed
01:44 - how i use lots of different asset packs
01:46 - to make the videos look interesting i'm
01:48 - a huge fan of the cynthia lopez style
01:50 - it's what i normally use in my videos if
01:52 - you prefer something more realistic then
01:54 - a great publisher is infinity pvr
01:56 - they've got great models super high
01:58 - fidelity really high quality for some
02:00 - animations you can find pretty much
02:02 - anything you can think of you have some
02:04 - regular medieval sword swinging
02:05 - animations or some rifled pistol
02:07 - animations you can even find some more
02:09 - exotic things like parkour animations
02:11 - zombie animations even some gun katah
02:13 - animations another visual thing is
02:15 - simply textures if you just search for
02:17 - it you'll find just about everything
02:19 - some in a realistic style other is very
02:21 - cartoony effects is another super simple
02:23 - way to really speed up development just
02:25 - add a gorgeous explosion to your game
02:27 - and it will instantly look much better
02:29 - you can find ui elements there's also
02:31 - skyboxes you'd be surprised at how big
02:33 - of a difference it makes to just swap
02:35 - out the default skybox and also tons of
02:37 - shaders especially useful if you want to
02:39 - make your game look kind of cel-shaded
02:40 - but you're not a shader programmer just
02:42 - pick up one of these and now really
02:44 - visuals but in a similar category are
02:46 - sounds there's lots of sound effects and
02:48 - musics on store so that's the first
02:50 - category for me as a programmer with no
02:52 - artistic skill this is the main way that
02:54 - i use the store but even if you do have
02:56 - those artistic skills it can be super
02:58 - helpful to just buy something and
02:59 - massively speed up your development for
03:01 - the next category that can really help
03:03 - you make your game faster are some
03:04 - complete game builder tools there's tons
03:07 - of these for pretty much all genres you
03:09 - can think of and pretty much all of
03:10 - these have excellent documentation to
03:12 - help you learn how the tool works
03:14 - usually these are pretty massive tools
03:15 - that have tons of systems and some
03:17 - really easy ways to implement all the
03:19 - features of that particular genre for
03:21 - example here is the rpg builder it's one
03:23 - of the highest rated assets on the store
03:25 - it even won a unity award this one lets
03:27 - you easily make a full-fledged rpg it
03:29 - features a quest system a combo system
03:32 - you can easily define factions action
03:34 - abilities enemy and npc ai you can make
03:36 - some talent trees stats and tons more or
03:38 - perhaps you want to make a top-down game
03:40 - for that you have the top-down engine
03:43 - supports both 2d and 3d really solid
03:45 - character controller includes an
03:47 - inventory system super easy level
03:49 - creation with moving platforms you can
03:51 - add some loot systems some keys and
03:52 - doors on top of that it's also
03:54 - multiplayer ready maybe you want to make
03:56 - a colony survival game so here is a
03:58 - colony simulator features building and
04:00 - resource crafting you can select
04:02 - colonists and automate their actions
04:04 - it has an inventory system equipment and
04:07 - weapons individual stats tech tree day
04:09 - night cycle and many more or perhaps you
04:11 - prefer making an rts if so then check
04:13 - out the rts engine easily handle tons of
04:16 - units on custom made maps you can give
04:18 - them commands it handles combat you can
04:20 - easily construct buildings get resources
04:22 - and make more units for making
04:23 - platformers you have the corgi engine
04:25 - works in both 2d and 2 and a half d
04:28 - it's got a super tight controller that
04:30 - feels great to play it's packed with
04:31 - over 50 demo levels includes camera and
04:34 - parallax dialog engine and inventory you
04:36 - can easily build levels with some
04:38 - gravity zones a bunch of jumpers cannons
04:40 - you can add destructible crates win
04:42 - letters and tons more or maybe you want
04:44 - to make a visual novel so for that here
04:46 - you have nanny novel it's designed for
04:49 - script writers it lets you focus on
04:51 - writing stories and not writing code
04:53 - features a text printer you can skip you
04:55 - can add character voicing transitions
04:57 - conditional story flow and tons more
04:59 - then there's even a bunch more assets
05:01 - for all kinds of genres so as you can
05:03 - see the assessor has lots of massive
05:05 - game builder tools to really help you
05:07 - quickly build the game in whatever genre
05:08 - you can think of for the next category
05:11 - it's something that pretty much most
05:12 - games need you need controllers for
05:14 - controlling whatever object you want
05:16 - like the player a car perhaps in third
05:19 - or first person and so on building your
05:21 - own controller is extremely time
05:22 - consuming it's simple to get something
05:24 - basic working but making something
05:26 - proper that can handle every scenario in
05:27 - your game making that is really complex
05:30 - so these controller assets can
05:31 - definitely save you a ton of time
05:33 - you have general controllers like the
05:35 - excellent free unity official star
05:37 - assets there's one in first person and
05:39 - one in third person for something more
05:41 - advanced you have this highly capable
05:43 - kinematic character controller easily
05:45 - handles all the terrain that you can
05:46 - throw at it you can go over slopes you
05:49 - can jump you can push physics objects
05:51 - around get on moving platforms walk on
05:54 - uneven terrain and much more it's even
05:56 - made with networking in mind for easy
05:58 - multiplayer for making a third person
06:00 - shooter here's an excellent highly rated
06:01 - controller this one is extremely modular
06:04 - and has tons of integrations and add-ons
06:06 - so it's almost kind of like a game
06:08 - bundle tool rather than just a
06:09 - controller but still it's a very solid
06:11 - character controller for third person
06:13 - shooter games for first-person shooters
06:15 - here's a great one you can quickly get
06:17 - an fps character up and running with a
06:19 - flexible accuracy and recoil system
06:22 - it features lots of scope types
06:23 - depending on your needs you can add some
06:25 - laser pointers and flashlights it also
06:27 - supports guided projectiles with various
06:29 - targeting systems
06:31 - and it even has parker support with some
06:33 - long running crowd slides and mentally
06:35 - if you're making a card game then this
06:36 - card controller can save you tons of
06:38 - time it's very high rated with tons of
06:40 - demo scenes features user-friendly
06:43 - editor scripts with tons of parameters
06:44 - for you to customize and also many
06:47 - pre-built prefabs you just drag and drop
06:49 - and it just works or perhaps you're
06:51 - working on a space game so for that here
06:52 - is the sci-fi ship controller you can
06:54 - easily create spaceships you can create
06:56 - airplanes hovercrafts and tons more so
06:58 - basically anything that can fly
07:01 - it's all physics driven comes with a
07:02 - wide range of options for ship flight
07:04 - mechanics you can add all kinds of
07:06 - flight assists aerodynamics damage
07:08 - models and lots more so like i said just
07:10 - about any game needs a controller and
07:12 - picking up one of these will save you a
07:13 - massive amount of time the next category
07:16 - is world building tools these are all
07:18 - kinds of tools that can really help you
07:20 - build massive worlds super quickly you
07:22 - have to also help out with world
07:24 - generation others to help you place down
07:26 - some objects and populate your world one
07:28 - of the biggest ones for this is gaia
07:30 - this one has been in active development
07:32 - for literally years it has over a
07:34 - thousand five star reviews really it's a
07:36 - massive tool for all of your world
07:38 - building needs you can easily generate
07:40 - worlds and look really awesome you can
07:42 - make them fully procedural or artists
07:43 - driven includes films for terraforming
07:46 - placing down trees defining biomes and
07:48 - much more this can really help you make
07:50 - some gorgeous massive whirls in hours or
07:52 - days instead of taking weeks or months
07:54 - if you prefer something more simple here
07:56 - is yet another prefab painter that's
07:58 - later in the name it does exactly what
08:00 - you expect you define some prefabs and
08:02 - easily paint and place them in your
08:04 - scenes it includes physics support so
08:06 - you can just drop some objects and place
08:08 - them really naturally
08:09 - perhaps your game is city based so here
08:11 - is a fantastic city generator easily
08:14 - generates some massive really convincing
08:16 - realistic cities automatically places
08:19 - down some buildings roads trees it can
08:21 - place down sidewalks crosshalls and just
08:23 - about everything that a city requires
08:25 - contains over 300 unique buildings and
08:27 - even has a full-fledged traffic system
08:30 - or maybe your game design requires caves
08:32 - and overhangs so here's a great tone for
08:34 - that you can take your terrain and
08:36 - easily dig some holes in it it's very
08:38 - easy to use you just click and dig it's
08:40 - super fast and best of all this works in
08:42 - real time so you can let your players
08:45 - customize their world and as the terrain
08:47 - is modified it also updates in navmesh
08:49 - so both your players and the ai can
08:50 - navigate these new caves these rom
08:53 - building tools can definitely help you
08:54 - save a ton of time possibly in the order
08:56 - of months so if you want to build in
08:58 - populate a game world definitely look
09:00 - into one of these instead of manually
09:01 - placing down game objects next up we
09:03 - have the category for systems and tools
09:06 - this one is a pretty broad category
09:08 - there's tons of tools that do so many
09:10 - things that can save you a monumental
09:12 - amount of time
09:13 - let's start with the obvious one the
09:14 - odin inspector i made a full review
09:17 - video on this one including a quick
09:18 - getting started tutorial it's a really
09:20 - awesome tool for building tools so
09:22 - depending on how you use it this one can
09:24 - definitely save you hundreds or
09:25 - thousands of hours
09:27 - then pretty much every game is going to
09:28 - need some kind of save system so
09:30 - something like easy save can save you
09:32 - many hours from trying to build it
09:33 - yourself
09:34 - you can serialize and save just about
09:36 - any data you can save it on a file or
09:38 - save it on the cloud
09:40 - it enables compression encryption and
09:42 - you can do just about anything related
09:44 - to saving and loading it even works
09:46 - without code so it integrates really
09:47 - well with playmaker bond or unity visual
09:50 - scripting using this asset instead of
09:52 - building your own safe system will
09:53 - certainly save you a ton of time also
09:55 - pretty much every game will have
09:56 - pathfinding you have the built-in unity
09:59 - nav mesh which is very good for what it
10:00 - is
10:01 - but if your game has more intense or
10:03 - unique pathfinding needs then check out
10:05 - the a-star pathfinding project almost
10:07 - every one of my steam games uses this
10:09 - asset when you enable multi-threading
10:11 - it's insanely fast it's pretty much free
10:13 - even in my game hyper nights where i
10:15 - could have over 1000 units on screen
10:17 - even in that one the pathfinding was
10:19 - still insanely fast
10:20 - i also did a detailed review on this one
10:22 - if you want to learn more and yet
10:24 - another great one that i've also
10:25 - reviewed is quantum console
10:27 - it's a super easy way to add a console
10:29 - to your game with just one attribute you
10:31 - can call functions from your in-game
10:33 - console this can massively help you
10:35 - speed up testing for example you're
10:37 - making a first person shooter game and
10:39 - you're testing something then suddenly
10:41 - you run out of ammo well you can just
10:43 - make a command to set the ammo and
10:44 - that's it so there's no need for custom
10:47 - debug code or some special keys to
10:49 - trigger debug commands
10:50 - you just use this asset open up the
10:52 - console and type the commands now i'm
10:54 - probably biased about this next one but
10:56 - you can use my own free health system
10:58 - instead of building one from scratch
11:00 - it's what i've used in every single
11:01 - video on this channel where i needed
11:02 - some health and it's used in pretty much
11:04 - all of my steam games it's basic and
11:06 - does exactly what you expect it stores
11:08 - health has a bunch of functions to
11:10 - interact with it and some events keeping
11:11 - the whole thing nice and clean so there
11:13 - are a ton of systems and tools that can
11:15 - really have a massive effect on your
11:17 - efficiency there's no need to build
11:19 - everything from scratch yourself and for
11:21 - the final category we have polish as you
11:23 - might have heard me say polish is what
11:25 - separates good games from great games
11:27 - adding that tiny bit of polish makes a
11:28 - massive difference so if you want your
11:30 - game to be as great as it can be then
11:32 - there's a bunch of polish tools to
11:33 - really help you do that one of the main
11:35 - ones that is all about polish is called
11:37 - feel like the name implies this one
11:39 - helps make your game feel awesome you
11:41 - can very easily add all kinds of screen
11:43 - shake add zooms color changes and so on
11:46 - adding some tiny animation or feedback
11:48 - to just about any player action will
11:49 - massively improve just how good your
11:51 - game feels i made a full review video on
11:53 - this one in that video i also made a
11:55 - quick getting started tutorial and took
11:57 - a really basic scene from boring to
11:59 - awesome in just a few minutes using this
12:00 - asset so it can definitely save you a
12:02 - ton of time if instead you want to
12:04 - handle those animations yourself and you
12:06 - just want a simple tool to tween some
12:08 - valleys then check out dutween it's very
12:10 - simple to take any film that you have
12:12 - define some sort of target and
12:14 - interpolate in any way you want you can
12:16 - use all kinds of curves to make the
12:17 - tweening exactly as you want it then if
12:19 - your game has shooting or any actions
12:21 - that should damage the environment then
12:23 - check out brayfire this one is a really
12:25 - awesome tool i love the results that
12:27 - this produces it makes for some really
12:29 - gorgeous destruction you have tons of
12:31 - control for how exactly you want the
12:33 - destruction to behave and many many ways
12:35 - to tweak the performance you can even
12:37 - get it working on mobile i also made a
12:39 - phone review on this one i really
12:40 - enjoyed using it to massively polish a
12:42 - simple third person shooter to something
12:44 - that looks and feels really awesome
12:46 - then static text is usually pretty
12:48 - boring so if your game has lots of text
12:50 - then check out the text animator it
12:52 - massively improves the feeling of your
12:54 - game by adding all sorts of tiny
12:55 - animations to your text you can make it
12:58 - shake you can animate it change color
13:00 - you can also apply it to just certain
13:01 - letters or words so if your character
13:03 - says something like i'm really angry you
13:05 - can make just the word angry shake in a
13:07 - really intense manner again another
13:09 - thing that will really make your game
13:10 - feel punished and professional and with
13:12 - this asset you can add it to your game
13:14 - pretty easily then i should also mention
13:16 - my own asset the mouse cursor system pro
13:18 - this one is a super easy way to add
13:20 - custom animated cursor to your game so
13:22 - you can modify the default boring arrow
13:24 - cursor and replace it with something
13:25 - much more interesting you can even make
13:27 - that cursor animated it's a tiny thing
13:30 - but it can really make your game stand
13:31 - out and also help your players learn how
13:33 - your game works without needing a
13:35 - dedicated tutorial for example if you
13:37 - mouse over an enemy and the cursor turns
13:39 - to a red crosshair then it's pretty
13:40 - intuitive that it means some kind of an
13:42 - attack if you mouse over an object and
13:44 - the cursor changes to a hand then it's
13:46 - pretty clear you can pick it up so
13:48 - obviously i'm biased about my own asset
13:49 - but it does exactly what you want in a
13:51 - super easy to use asset once again
13:53 - polish is what separates good games from
13:55 - great games and these tools can help you
13:57 - push your game to that level in a pretty
13:59 - short amount of time alright so those
14:01 - are about 20 assets split into six
14:03 - categories that can really help you
14:04 - speed up development of your game i'm
14:06 - sure that several of these can be super
14:08 - useful regardless of whatever genre
14:10 - you're currently working on they're all
14:11 - linked in the description so check them
14:13 - out alright hope that's useful check out
14:15 - these videos to learn some more thanks
14:17 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
14:19 - making these videos possible thank you
14:21 - for watching and i'll see you next time
14:27 - [Music]
14:31 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey as you know the ssor has tons of awesome tools and assets to help you in every way imaginable there's so much awesome stuff that it's impossible to keep track of it all so here let's look at about 20 assets that can help you massively speed up development of your game and get something playable super quickly or just help you polish whatever you already have i organized all these assets into six distinct categories to help you in different ways i chose to highlight so many assets because there's lots of super useful ones but whether or not they are useful will depend on what kind of game and what genre you're making so regardless of the genre i'm sure that several of these 20 that i'm going to highlight can be a great help to you in speeding up development of your game and helping finish whatever project you're currently working on also this video is sponsored by unity okay so let's see how the ssr can help you speed up development i organized all of these assets into six discrete categories there's timestamps in the video and all of the assets are linked in the description quick mention unity right now is having a sale in a bunch of the assets mentioned in this video are on sale until next week then when this one ends there's another sale with even more assets discounted and in the last week the best of both sales will again get a discount so check the links below and if it's not on sale check again next week and make sure you use the coupon to get a bonus discount up to 15 percent more let's begin just briefly with the simplest most obvious category which are visual assets these are 3d models textures animations effects ui elements skyboxes and possibly even custom shaders for me as someone who has pretty much no artistic skill for me this is one of the main ways that i use the store so in my case it's more due to lack of skills rather than wanting to speed up development but even if you are a talented 3d modeler or animator it can still save you a ton of time to just buy something instead of building everything from scratch if you're a regular on the channel then you've certainly noticed how i use lots of different asset packs to make the videos look interesting i'm a huge fan of the cynthia lopez style it's what i normally use in my videos if you prefer something more realistic then a great publisher is infinity pvr they've got great models super high fidelity really high quality for some animations you can find pretty much anything you can think of you have some regular medieval sword swinging animations or some rifled pistol animations you can even find some more exotic things like parkour animations zombie animations even some gun katah animations another visual thing is simply textures if you just search for it you'll find just about everything some in a realistic style other is very cartoony effects is another super simple way to really speed up development just add a gorgeous explosion to your game and it will instantly look much better you can find ui elements there's also skyboxes you'd be surprised at how big of a difference it makes to just swap out the default skybox and also tons of shaders especially useful if you want to make your game look kind of celshaded but you're not a shader programmer just pick up one of these and now really visuals but in a similar category are sounds there's lots of sound effects and musics on store so that's the first category for me as a programmer with no artistic skill this is the main way that i use the store but even if you do have those artistic skills it can be super helpful to just buy something and massively speed up your development for the next category that can really help you make your game faster are some complete game builder tools there's tons of these for pretty much all genres you can think of and pretty much all of these have excellent documentation to help you learn how the tool works usually these are pretty massive tools that have tons of systems and some really easy ways to implement all the features of that particular genre for example here is the rpg builder it's one of the highest rated assets on the store it even won a unity award this one lets you easily make a fullfledged rpg it features a quest system a combo system you can easily define factions action abilities enemy and npc ai you can make some talent trees stats and tons more or perhaps you want to make a topdown game for that you have the topdown engine supports both 2d and 3d really solid character controller includes an inventory system super easy level creation with moving platforms you can add some loot systems some keys and doors on top of that it's also multiplayer ready maybe you want to make a colony survival game so here is a colony simulator features building and resource crafting you can select colonists and automate their actions it has an inventory system equipment and weapons individual stats tech tree day night cycle and many more or perhaps you prefer making an rts if so then check out the rts engine easily handle tons of units on custom made maps you can give them commands it handles combat you can easily construct buildings get resources and make more units for making platformers you have the corgi engine works in both 2d and 2 and a half d it's got a super tight controller that feels great to play it's packed with over 50 demo levels includes camera and parallax dialog engine and inventory you can easily build levels with some gravity zones a bunch of jumpers cannons you can add destructible crates win letters and tons more or maybe you want to make a visual novel so for that here you have nanny novel it's designed for script writers it lets you focus on writing stories and not writing code features a text printer you can skip you can add character voicing transitions conditional story flow and tons more then there's even a bunch more assets for all kinds of genres so as you can see the assessor has lots of massive game builder tools to really help you quickly build the game in whatever genre you can think of for the next category it's something that pretty much most games need you need controllers for controlling whatever object you want like the player a car perhaps in third or first person and so on building your own controller is extremely time consuming it's simple to get something basic working but making something proper that can handle every scenario in your game making that is really complex so these controller assets can definitely save you a ton of time you have general controllers like the excellent free unity official star assets there's one in first person and one in third person for something more advanced you have this highly capable kinematic character controller easily handles all the terrain that you can throw at it you can go over slopes you can jump you can push physics objects around get on moving platforms walk on uneven terrain and much more it's even made with networking in mind for easy multiplayer for making a third person shooter here's an excellent highly rated controller this one is extremely modular and has tons of integrations and addons so it's almost kind of like a game bundle tool rather than just a controller but still it's a very solid character controller for third person shooter games for firstperson shooters here's a great one you can quickly get an fps character up and running with a flexible accuracy and recoil system it features lots of scope types depending on your needs you can add some laser pointers and flashlights it also supports guided projectiles with various targeting systems and it even has parker support with some long running crowd slides and mentally if you're making a card game then this card controller can save you tons of time it's very high rated with tons of demo scenes features userfriendly editor scripts with tons of parameters for you to customize and also many prebuilt prefabs you just drag and drop and it just works or perhaps you're working on a space game so for that here is the scifi ship controller you can easily create spaceships you can create airplanes hovercrafts and tons more so basically anything that can fly it's all physics driven comes with a wide range of options for ship flight mechanics you can add all kinds of flight assists aerodynamics damage models and lots more so like i said just about any game needs a controller and picking up one of these will save you a massive amount of time the next category is world building tools these are all kinds of tools that can really help you build massive worlds super quickly you have to also help out with world generation others to help you place down some objects and populate your world one of the biggest ones for this is gaia this one has been in active development for literally years it has over a thousand five star reviews really it's a massive tool for all of your world building needs you can easily generate worlds and look really awesome you can make them fully procedural or artists driven includes films for terraforming placing down trees defining biomes and much more this can really help you make some gorgeous massive whirls in hours or days instead of taking weeks or months if you prefer something more simple here is yet another prefab painter that's later in the name it does exactly what you expect you define some prefabs and easily paint and place them in your scenes it includes physics support so you can just drop some objects and place them really naturally perhaps your game is city based so here is a fantastic city generator easily generates some massive really convincing realistic cities automatically places down some buildings roads trees it can place down sidewalks crosshalls and just about everything that a city requires contains over 300 unique buildings and even has a fullfledged traffic system or maybe your game design requires caves and overhangs so here's a great tone for that you can take your terrain and easily dig some holes in it it's very easy to use you just click and dig it's super fast and best of all this works in real time so you can let your players customize their world and as the terrain is modified it also updates in navmesh so both your players and the ai can navigate these new caves these rom building tools can definitely help you save a ton of time possibly in the order of months so if you want to build in populate a game world definitely look into one of these instead of manually placing down game objects next up we have the category for systems and tools this one is a pretty broad category there's tons of tools that do so many things that can save you a monumental amount of time let's start with the obvious one the odin inspector i made a full review video on this one including a quick getting started tutorial it's a really awesome tool for building tools so depending on how you use it this one can definitely save you hundreds or thousands of hours then pretty much every game is going to need some kind of save system so something like easy save can save you many hours from trying to build it yourself you can serialize and save just about any data you can save it on a file or save it on the cloud it enables compression encryption and you can do just about anything related to saving and loading it even works without code so it integrates really well with playmaker bond or unity visual scripting using this asset instead of building your own safe system will certainly save you a ton of time also pretty much every game will have pathfinding you have the builtin unity nav mesh which is very good for what it is but if your game has more intense or unique pathfinding needs then check out the astar pathfinding project almost every one of my steam games uses this asset when you enable multithreading it's insanely fast it's pretty much free even in my game hyper nights where i could have over 1000 units on screen even in that one the pathfinding was still insanely fast i also did a detailed review on this one if you want to learn more and yet another great one that i've also reviewed is quantum console it's a super easy way to add a console to your game with just one attribute you can call functions from your ingame console this can massively help you speed up testing for example you're making a first person shooter game and you're testing something then suddenly you run out of ammo well you can just make a command to set the ammo and that's it so there's no need for custom debug code or some special keys to trigger debug commands you just use this asset open up the console and type the commands now i'm probably biased about this next one but you can use my own free health system instead of building one from scratch it's what i've used in every single video on this channel where i needed some health and it's used in pretty much all of my steam games it's basic and does exactly what you expect it stores health has a bunch of functions to interact with it and some events keeping the whole thing nice and clean so there are a ton of systems and tools that can really have a massive effect on your efficiency there's no need to build everything from scratch yourself and for the final category we have polish as you might have heard me say polish is what separates good games from great games adding that tiny bit of polish makes a massive difference so if you want your game to be as great as it can be then there's a bunch of polish tools to really help you do that one of the main ones that is all about polish is called feel like the name implies this one helps make your game feel awesome you can very easily add all kinds of screen shake add zooms color changes and so on adding some tiny animation or feedback to just about any player action will massively improve just how good your game feels i made a full review video on this one in that video i also made a quick getting started tutorial and took a really basic scene from boring to awesome in just a few minutes using this asset so it can definitely save you a ton of time if instead you want to handle those animations yourself and you just want a simple tool to tween some valleys then check out dutween it's very simple to take any film that you have define some sort of target and interpolate in any way you want you can use all kinds of curves to make the tweening exactly as you want it then if your game has shooting or any actions that should damage the environment then check out brayfire this one is a really awesome tool i love the results that this produces it makes for some really gorgeous destruction you have tons of control for how exactly you want the destruction to behave and many many ways to tweak the performance you can even get it working on mobile i also made a phone review on this one i really enjoyed using it to massively polish a simple third person shooter to something that looks and feels really awesome then static text is usually pretty boring so if your game has lots of text then check out the text animator it massively improves the feeling of your game by adding all sorts of tiny animations to your text you can make it shake you can animate it change color you can also apply it to just certain letters or words so if your character says something like i'm really angry you can make just the word angry shake in a really intense manner again another thing that will really make your game feel punished and professional and with this asset you can add it to your game pretty easily then i should also mention my own asset the mouse cursor system pro this one is a super easy way to add custom animated cursor to your game so you can modify the default boring arrow cursor and replace it with something much more interesting you can even make that cursor animated it's a tiny thing but it can really make your game stand out and also help your players learn how your game works without needing a dedicated tutorial for example if you mouse over an enemy and the cursor turns to a red crosshair then it's pretty intuitive that it means some kind of an attack if you mouse over an object and the cursor changes to a hand then it's pretty clear you can pick it up so obviously i'm biased about my own asset but it does exactly what you want in a super easy to use asset once again polish is what separates good games from great games and these tools can help you push your game to that level in a pretty short amount of time alright so those are about 20 assets split into six categories that can really help you speed up development of your game i'm sure that several of these can be super useful regardless of whatever genre you're currently working on they're all linked in the description so check them out alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
