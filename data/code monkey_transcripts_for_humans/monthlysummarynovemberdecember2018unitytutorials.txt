00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to review all
00:03 - the videos published in November and
00:04 - December 2018 let's begin
00:09 - so November start with the continuation
00:11 - of the simple character movement first a
00:13 - simple character - ability which is a
00:15 - very nice ability that fits perfectly in
00:17 - any sort of action game and then the
00:20 - dodge roll which is mainly different
00:22 - from the - due to having a dodge
00:23 - movement over time instead of being an
00:25 - instant teleport there was also the
00:27 - summary video for the waiting queue in
00:29 - battleground tycoon now that game is out
00:31 - it's great to revisit the summary to see
00:34 - all the elements that make up the queues
00:35 - in the final game we also have the
00:38 - conclusion of the graph series this is
00:40 - the enormous series I've done it started
00:42 - off very simple and became increasingly
00:44 - more complex and feature-rich over time
00:46 - we first had the line graph visual
00:48 - object which is the class that lets us
00:50 - have more control over each point in the
00:52 - graph then we took the in line graph and
00:54 - bar chart visual objects and using their
00:56 - update methods we'd made the code to
00:58 - update the graph in real time this is
01:01 - much better for performance than what we
01:02 - were doing previously which was
01:04 - completely destroying and recreating the
01:06 - graph each time and finally the last
01:08 - video in the series was showing the
01:09 - graph being used in the published
01:11 - version of battle morale Tycoon so it's
01:13 - great to see the progression in this
01:14 - series how its surhoff very simple and
01:16 - ended up being used in a published
01:18 - commercial game moving on to December it
01:20 - served with the video announcing the
01:22 - launch of Parramatta Kune which was the
01:24 - reason there were fewer videos in
01:25 - November then we had a summary of the
01:28 - test system which again is great to
01:30 - revisit after you play the game so you
01:32 - see how the underlying systems work to
01:35 - videos on quick tips these are very
01:36 - short videos that contain a single tip
01:38 - that might help you immensely first we
01:40 - know how to show a spry trainer without
01:42 - having to make a custom sprite by using
01:43 - a generic white pixel and then how to
01:46 - clone a template transform so you don't
01:48 - clutter your project files with lots of
01:50 - single-use prefabs we also started off a
01:52 - new series focusing on how to make a
01:54 - tooltip this is an extremely important
01:56 - element for any game which is UI heavy
01:58 - unless you show
01:59 - extra information to the player but only
02:01 - when needed so first we create the
02:03 - tooltip in the editor and add the code
02:05 - to resize it to fit any text while
02:07 - following the mouse then we use the
02:10 - background size in the camera view to
02:11 - make sure our tooltip never leaves the
02:13 - screen after that we have the ability to
02:15 - update our tooltip in real time in order
02:17 - to display something like a corner also
02:20 - we had it static
02:21 - auctions and extension methods to make
02:23 - the class very easy to use and finally
02:25 - we had videos on modular spreadsheets as
02:28 - used for guests in barata Kuhn this is
02:30 - an excellent and very simple method of
02:32 - creating near infinite possibilities so
02:34 - you never have two guests that look
02:35 - exactly the same
02:37 - first we define how we were going to
02:39 - compose our final sprite
02:40 - what's our base and how to copy pixels
02:42 - from a spreadsheet that contains
02:43 - multiple body parts then we composed a
02:46 - final body part from multiple elements
02:48 - we took the base head and applied a
02:51 - random beard and hair song and then
02:53 - we'll learn how we could tend to
02:54 - individual pixels so using that and the
02:57 - white base spreadsheet we managed to get
02:59 - multiple colors on hair and beards the
03:02 - upcoming videos cover how to tint the
03:04 - skin color while using a pixel mask and
03:06 - then creating a body with primary and
03:08 - secondary colors so that was it for the
03:10 - months of November and December 2018 I
03:13 - hope you found the videos helpful and
03:14 - learned something along the way
03:15 - here's to a 20-19 form of interesting
03:18 - videos and never increasing knowledge
03:19 - base if you have any questions regarding
03:22 - any of the videos feel free to post them
03:23 - in the comments and I'll do my best to
03:25 - answer them subscribe for more videos
03:26 - and I'll see you next time
