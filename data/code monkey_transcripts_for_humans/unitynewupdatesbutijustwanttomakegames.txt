00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - so everything is still on fire I'm
00:04 - trying to work on my game today but it
00:06 - kind of feels like everything is blowing
00:07 - up so I really can't focus this morning
00:09 - I was trying to do the same thing that I
00:10 - always do every day and answer just some
00:12 - regular questions from my tutorial
00:13 - videos but with so many comments on the
00:15 - last video it's really hard to find them
00:16 - there have been some updates since
00:18 - yesterday like for example apparently
00:20 - now green Styles no longer count for the
00:22 - totem and fraud and malicious attacks
00:24 - also supposedly don't count but no
00:27 - Clarity on how exactly they will
00:28 - identify those apparently Game Pass also
00:31 - either does not count or Microsoft won't
00:33 - supposedly pay for that again no Clarity
00:35 - on how exactly this will happen demos
00:37 - Charities and tests also apparently do
00:39 - not count so things are still constantly
00:41 - changing no idea what will have changed
00:43 - by the time that this video goes live
00:44 - and honestly also no idea what they can
00:47 - even do at this point to regain the
00:48 - trust that so many people have lost but
00:50 - I also want to clarify something myself
00:52 - in my last video I focus mainly on
00:54 - analyzing these changes through the lens
00:56 - of my own personal experience as a song
00:58 - of indidev and from that hyper-specific
01:00 - lens meaning none of my games won't ever
01:02 - make a million dollars for my particular
01:04 - use case my conclusion was nothing
01:06 - changes now because not because the fact
01:08 - that I was calm and not extremely angry
01:10 - because that some people took it as me
01:12 - defending these changes or something
01:13 - calling me a Shell or accusing me of
01:15 - being paid by unity it was my most
01:17 - disliked video by far so let me just be
01:19 - perfectly clear do I think these changes
01:22 - as a whole are net negative yes do they
01:24 - affect the specific way that I work no
01:27 - that's really it if I was UNT CEO I
01:30 - would not have implemented these changes
01:31 - but I don't work for Unity I have no
01:34 - power all I can do is just like you look
01:36 - at these changes analyze how they will
01:38 - impact me and the way that I work and
01:39 - then act accordingly the only thing that
01:41 - I can promise you is really that in
01:42 - these videos I won't always be honest
01:44 - and share my genuine point of view
01:46 - whether that's positive negative or
01:47 - neutral so that means if I've analyzed
01:49 - things and I'm calm then I'm not going
01:51 - to pretend to be angry just because
01:52 - everyone else is also angry if I told
01:54 - you that I was planning to quit Unity
01:56 - that would not be true the game that I'm
01:58 - currently working on is made with unity
01:59 - whatever game I made next will also be
02:01 - made with DNT the many tutorials that
02:03 - I'm still planning to make in the future
02:05 - they will also be made with DNT the
02:07 - engine itself is still an excellent
02:08 - piece of tech capable of building almost
02:10 - anything but like I said that is just my
02:12 - personal point of view I can fully
02:14 - understand people for whom this is their
02:15 - breaking point if that's you then that's
02:17 - fine I am not trying to change your mind
02:19 - unreal and Godot are both excellent
02:21 - engines nowadays you really can't go
02:23 - wrong when picking any engine the game's
02:25 - industry is huge there's a mountain of
02:27 - different ways to make games different
02:28 - ways to monetize and this change that
02:30 - they made this one is going to affect
02:32 - everything on developer in different
02:33 - ways all I can really do is just speak
02:35 - based on my own experience and I only
02:37 - have experience as a solo steam in the
02:39 - dev I cannot speak as to how this change
02:41 - will affect every single corner of the
02:43 - entire game industry I'm really just a
02:44 - random guy in my room making videos and
02:46 - making games just like you if this
02:48 - affects you negatively if you are
02:50 - against this change then I highly highly
02:52 - encourage you to make some noise Make
02:53 - your voice heard on the forums I know
02:55 - tons of unity people are reading all the
02:57 - feedback and passing it on to their
02:58 - higher ups although please don't harass
03:00 - the public facing Indie people they also
03:02 - have no power to change things directly
03:04 - honestly this blew up so much that I
03:05 - really have to believe that they won't
03:07 - either revert it completely or make some
03:09 - serious changes but at the same time
03:10 - like I said I'm not sure there's
03:12 - anything they can do to regain trust at
03:14 - this point for some people this was a
03:16 - step too far and they can never trust
03:17 - CNT again perhaps they could completely
03:19 - walk back these changes instead of just
03:21 - trying to clarify what exactly counts as
03:23 - an insult perhaps they could make a new
03:25 - Yola that legally guarantees they can
03:27 - never again change the terms after the
03:29 - fact basically like the title says I
03:31 - really just want to make games that's
03:32 - really it I started using Unity back in
03:34 - 2012 because it was the only option and
03:36 - I've kept using it over these past 10
03:38 - years because the engine as a tool still
03:40 - allows me to build any game that I can
03:41 - imagine for me that's pretty much the
03:43 - only thing that counts the engine itself
03:45 - has no change in any way and the new
03:46 - pricing does not affect devs at my scale
03:48 - so that is why I'm calm and not super
03:50 - angry like most people also part of the
03:52 - reason why I'm not super angry or scared
03:54 - about the future is simply because I
03:56 - used to be a flash developer my
03:57 - livelihood was completely tied to flash
03:59 - then it eventually died as I found my
04:01 - way in TNT so perhaps that's also why
04:04 - I'm more calmed than most people I know
04:06 - that if this truly is the beginning of
04:07 - the end for ENT if that truly is the
04:09 - case then I trust my own skills to be
04:11 - able to survive into whatever comes next
04:12 - but right now all I really want to do is
04:15 - just make games so I'm going to edit
04:17 - this video and get back to working on my
04:18 - game while watching how all of this will
04:20 - unfold alright so thanks for watching
04:22 - and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so everything is still on fire I'm trying to work on my game today but it kind of feels like everything is blowing up so I really can't focus this morning I was trying to do the same thing that I always do every day and answer just some regular questions from my tutorial videos but with so many comments on the last video it's really hard to find them there have been some updates since yesterday like for example apparently now green Styles no longer count for the totem and fraud and malicious attacks also supposedly don't count but no Clarity on how
