00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - So lately there's been a very strange
00:04 - conversation blowing up supposedly a ton
00:06 - of devs are angry because an excellent
00:08 - game came out and gamers are calling
00:09 - them out for being lazy and not making
00:11 - good games on purpose although this
00:12 - whole thing makes me feel like I'm crazy
00:14 - because I don't see anything like that I
00:15 - haven't seen any anger or Penny coming
00:17 - from any devs the only thing I saw from
00:19 - devs when the game came out was people
00:21 - just congratulating them on their
00:22 - success and making an excellent game now
00:24 - maybe that's just me that's just
00:26 - specifically my fiend I'm a solo Indie
00:28 - Dev I'm not part of the AAA industry my
00:30 - Twitter feed is mainly just Unity Indie
00:32 - devs so maybe I'm just sucking my own
00:34 - bubble or maybe this whole thing is
00:36 - really just manufacturers to get a bunch
00:37 - of clicks it all started on this IGN
00:39 - video titled bondage Gate 3 is causing
00:41 - some developers to panic then this blew
00:44 - up and tons of other comments and
00:45 - commentary videos made it sound like
00:47 - there's a large amount of developers
00:49 - that are supposedly angry because
00:50 - layering Studios they just raised the
00:52 - bar by so much which makes other devs
00:53 - look bad now I've done some research to
00:55 - try to find out if this is indeed
00:57 - correct but I could not find much I went
00:59 - on Twitter and I tried searching for
01:00 - bunders Gate 3 devs and there's all
01:02 - kinds of really strange comments kind of
01:05 - disappointing to see AAA devs complain
01:06 - about bonus K3 game devs being angry
01:09 - about bombers E3 is so funny there are
01:11 - game devs who are mad at Bonsai 3
01:13 - because it's too good originally had no
01:15 - interest involved with j3 but devs
01:17 - panicking that they must do their jobs
01:18 - properly because of it has been tempting
01:20 - me to buy the game some lots of comments
01:22 - on apparently people I'm talking about
01:24 - all kinds of panicky and angry game devs
01:26 - but I really can't find any of those
01:28 - supposed game devs so this whole thing
01:30 - generally makes me feel like I'm taking
01:31 - crazy pills or maybe my Twitter feed is
01:33 - just broken in some way if there are
01:35 - indeed all of these developers
01:36 - supposedly angry or jealous about the
01:38 - game why can't I just find them the
01:40 - closest thing to a negative comment that
01:42 - I can actually find is something like
01:43 - this just some devs who are basically
01:45 - worried that when it came on this
01:46 - massive scale when this finds such
01:48 - success it leads to management pushing
01:49 - for bigger and bigger scale bigger and
01:51 - bigger games which in turn can lead to
01:53 - more and more crunch which is already a
01:54 - big problem in the industry then some
01:56 - more tweets simply pointing out how the
01:58 - game is both awesome and massive again
02:00 - just pointing out the scale and the
02:01 - excellent talent that this team has all
02:03 - this is positive no one is arguing for
02:05 - Worse games just pointing out how some
02:07 - factors that made this game cannot be
02:08 - easily replicated that's really it I
02:10 - really don't see any angry or panicky
02:12 - devs basically after researching all
02:14 - this it seems like this IGN video and
02:16 - this whole controversy just seems to
02:18 - mean like one of those manufactured
02:19 - outrages where you just take a comment
02:21 - from a single person and just twist it
02:23 - in a negative way and just boil it out
02:24 - of proportion the whole thing seems to
02:26 - be based off just a single tweet from a
02:28 - single Dev and not really something
02:29 - related to the entire Game Dev Community
02:31 - not to mention that this tweet isn't
02:33 - even really negative in fact it's
02:34 - actually quite the opposite it's
02:35 - pointing out all of the excellent things
02:37 - that layering Studios did very well that
02:39 - came to this excellent game it also
02:41 - simply also points out the various
02:42 - advantages that they had in making this
02:44 - great game advantages that not
02:46 - necessarily every Studio has access to
02:47 - like in terms of talent and resources
02:49 - which is definitely absolutely true now
02:51 - don't get me wrong the big Studios from
02:53 - Activision and EA they definitely do
02:54 - have enough money but even if you're
02:56 - willing to spend an unlimited amount of
02:58 - time and money on a game there is no
03:00 - guarantee of success or quality
03:02 - basically the controversy seems to be
03:03 - people saying that devs aren't lazy and
03:05 - that is why all games are not as awesome
03:07 - as Ballers gate 3. now here on this
03:09 - channel where the audience is mainly in
03:11 - the devs I always highly advise against
03:13 - spending years and years working on a
03:14 - game sure you could technically spend
03:16 - years end up making a masterpiece like
03:18 - Sardi Valley and sell millions of copies
03:20 - of an excellent game that's technically
03:21 - possible but that is an outlier by
03:24 - definition you should definitely not
03:25 - expect your game to be an outlier you
03:27 - should not risk your own livelihood you
03:29 - should not risk going homeless with the
03:31 - expectation that your game won't be one
03:32 - of the best games ever made maybe it
03:34 - won't be but it probably won't that
03:36 - doesn't mean that you shouldn't try your
03:38 - best you definitely should try your best
03:39 - but despite your best efforts you will
03:41 - likely not make the next Starry Valley
03:43 - the way I see the argument in this tweet
03:45 - is exactly the same thing it is not
03:47 - saying that devs shouldn't aim to make
03:48 - excellent games like bottles of A3 it
03:51 - just means that this game is an outlier
03:52 - both in terms of resources and in terms
03:54 - of success all the other reference
03:56 - Suites of them just say the exact same
03:58 - thing no one is arguing for Worse games
04:00 - they're just pointing out that an
04:01 - outlier is by definition an outlier I
04:04 - believe what he was also trying to say
04:05 - was simply don't expect this insane
04:07 - level of scale and polish coming from
04:08 - every single RPG especially the ones
04:11 - made by indie devs or small to
04:12 - medium-sized teams which definitely do
04:14 - not have 400 people and tens of millions
04:16 - of dollars to spend on making one game
04:18 - over seven years personally as he saw
04:20 - Indie Dev I've been on receiving end of
04:22 - some players with some very harsh
04:23 - demands I've received comments on my
04:25 - three dollar games asking why the game
04:27 - is dead and hasn't received updates
04:28 - despite being several years old also I'm
04:30 - currently working on my upcoming
04:32 - automation game I'm trying my absolute
04:34 - best but I'm pretty certain that my game
04:36 - will not be as good or as successful as
04:38 - some like Factory and if a player were
04:40 - to ask me okay so why should I play your
04:41 - game and not factorium my answer to that
04:43 - is you shouldn't you should go play
04:45 - factorio that game is a masterpiece but
04:48 - I'm guessing you're not going to play
04:49 - just one single game for your internal
04:51 - life so after you're done with factorial
04:53 - maybe give my game a try not every game
04:55 - needs to be a masterpiece there's tons
04:57 - of space in the industry for different
04:59 - games with different scales and
05:00 - different levels of quality the
05:02 - masterpieces should absolutely be
05:03 - celebrating but they are by definition
05:05 - the outliers and this week is pointing
05:07 - out that even for big studios that do
05:09 - have the resources spending that time
05:11 - and money is no guarantee of quality
05:13 - that's really it trying to replicate
05:15 - that process can lead to either the same
05:16 - success or it can kill entire groups of
05:18 - Studios one example is the conclusive
05:20 - protocol that one came out last year
05:22 - they spent a ton of time in money making
05:24 - that game they also had a very
05:26 - experienced very talented team they
05:28 - called it a quantity game but despite
05:30 - all those resources and devs that were
05:32 - definitely very passionate about making
05:33 - the best game possible the director was
05:35 - even the director of the original Dead
05:37 - Space so very talented and tons of funds
05:39 - but despite their best efforts and
05:40 - resources the game did not end up as
05:42 - good as unlike to the point where sadly
05:44 - recently they actually had to do some
05:46 - layoffs that's exactly the point that
05:48 - this tweet is making I really don't see
05:49 - how this tweet can be read as Dev
05:51 - arguing for Worse games or Envy of a
05:53 - successful game or something like that
05:55 - on tweet he literally says I'm deeply
05:57 - excited about what the lovely phones
05:59 - that larion accomplished with bunders
06:00 - gate 3. it is simply pointing out that
06:02 - an outlier is by definition outlier all
06:04 - the other related tweets those are all
06:06 - in agreement that the game is excellent
06:07 - I certainly cannot find a ton of other
06:10 - devs somehow panicking because an
06:11 - excellent game came out maybe there are
06:14 - indeed a ton of devs who for some reason
06:15 - want to make terrible games and this
06:17 - excellent game won't force them to do
06:18 - better and somehow they're angry at that
06:20 - maybe that's the case even though every
06:22 - single Dev that I know they love what
06:24 - they do and they're trying to make the
06:25 - best games possible or maybe given how
06:27 - the video is based off a single tweet
06:29 - and it's intentionally twisting that
06:31 - tweet into a negative light move this
06:33 - whole thing is really not based on
06:34 - reality at all it's all just about
06:36 - getting clicks which has certainly been
06:37 - very successful this IGN video has over
06:40 - 1 million views whereas most of their
06:42 - regular videos they just get 20 to 50K
06:44 - views so if they're going with some
06:46 - manufactured outrage in order to get
06:47 - some clicks then congrats because this
06:49 - strategy was clearly very successful but
06:51 - based on my research it does not seem to
06:53 - be based on reality at all really the
06:55 - only reaction that I can find from devs
06:56 - are people celebrating the fact that an
06:58 - excellent game came out and found
06:59 - massive success that's just objectively
07:01 - good for anyone working in the industry
07:03 - or anyone who loves playing games now do
07:05 - let me know your thoughts in the
07:06 - comments am I somehow some way
07:08 - completely missing a huge loss of devs
07:10 - who are somehow angry at this game I
07:12 - really don't see it but again Twitter is
07:14 - different from everyone and the search
07:15 - does seem to suck quite a bit so I could
07:17 - be missing something definitely do let
07:19 - me know if I'm wrong

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey So lately there's been a very strange conversation blowing up supposedly a ton of devs are angry because an excellent game came out and gamers are calling them
