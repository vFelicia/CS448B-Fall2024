00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video I'm going to give you
00:02 - seven reasons to use unity in 2019 let's
00:05 - begin
00:08 - so here we are it's 2019 and if you're
00:11 - brand new to game development you might
00:13 - be wondering if unity is a good choice
00:14 - to start using in 2019 there are lots of
00:17 - excellent game engines nowadays and
00:19 - pretty much all of them have some sort
00:20 - of free version this is definitely the
00:22 - best time ever to get served with game
00:24 - development at least when it comes to
00:25 - the availability of tools now I know
00:27 - this video might come across is almost
00:29 - an ad for unity but if you're here
00:31 - watching this video I'm guessing you're
00:32 - interested in making games which is what
00:34 - I do I'm currently in the middle of
00:35 - developing my own latest game using
00:37 - unity and I see no reason why I would
00:39 - switch in the future reason number one
00:41 - c-sharp unity uses C sharp which is a
00:44 - very powerful language it is continually
00:46 - getting support with new versions and
00:48 - updates both to the language itself and
00:50 - the compiler performance wise it's
00:51 - already a very fast language and with
00:54 - the new compiler and entity component
00:56 - system coming to unit in 2019 it will
00:58 - only get even faster also since it's one
01:01 - of the more popular languages you can
01:02 - find tutorials on just about anything
01:04 - you can think of as well as many
01:06 - libraries to help you out and also if in
01:08 - the future you wish to move away from
01:10 - game development into regular software
01:11 - development c-sharp has lots of job
01:13 - opportunities reason number two great
01:16 - for 2d and 3d
01:17 - despite being first marketed towards 3d
01:20 - game development over the years there
01:22 - have been many 2d features added and
01:24 - right now you can really create anything
01:26 - you want regardless of the perspective
01:28 - nowadays you can find just as many 2d
01:30 - assets and tutorials as for 3d it can
01:33 - make pixel perfect games or massive 3d
01:35 - worlds and anything in between recently
01:37 - they had AI key support for 2d
01:39 - characters so you can easily create cool
01:41 - animations so as you see they are
01:42 - constantly adding tools for both 2d and
01:44 - 3d reasons number three white platform
01:47 - support unity supports lots of different
01:50 - platforms and in a very simple way with
01:52 - a push of a button
01:53 - you can build your game to work on
01:55 - Windows Mac or Linux if you're
01:57 - publishing on Steam then you should know
01:58 - that while most people do use Windows
02:00 - there are still a lot of people who
02:02 - prefer Mac or Linux so having such an
02:04 - effortless way to give those people a
02:06 - native build is a huge plus and really
02:08 - help you stand out in a crowded market
02:10 - if you're interested in mobile
02:11 - development you can easily export to
02:13 - Android or iOS or with many optimization
02:16 - features make sure your game run
02:17 - smoothly on any kind of mobile hardware
02:20 - and it also supports consoles as well as
02:22 - VR and the web so essentially if you
02:24 - make a game in unity you can get running
02:26 - on pretty much any system you find
02:28 - reason number for real-world use cases
02:31 - the illicit games made in unity is
02:33 - already massive and just keeps growing
02:35 - you can create very complex games like
02:37 - Kerbal space program or prison architect
02:39 - or you can create gorgeous games like
02:41 - Orion des moines forest or kapap it is
02:44 - used by the smallest of Indies to the
02:46 - largest of triple-a companies looking at
02:48 - that list should give you confidence
02:50 - that anything is possible to create with
02:52 - the engine reason number five extensive
02:54 - online services I'm putting this one
02:56 - under just one reason but really each of
02:59 - these services is the reason of its own
03:01 - through your Unity dashboard you can
03:03 - access many services which are very very
03:05 - valuable if you're working as part of a
03:07 - team there are lots of features to make
03:09 - collaboration very easy then you have
03:11 - unity ads which lets you easily add
03:13 - adverts into your game if that's the
03:15 - sort of monetization you're interested
03:17 - in analytics lets you set up your own
03:19 - custom triggers to see where your
03:21 - players are winning or losing so you can
03:23 - make changes accordingly cloud
03:25 - Diagnostics are one of my favorite since
03:27 - then let you see what errors are
03:28 - happening in your game this is extremely
03:30 - useful since it's very difficult to get
03:32 - bug reports from people and ask them to
03:34 - send their logs using this you have a
03:36 - lot of information to be able to tackle
03:37 - any bugs that you don't actually
03:39 - experience yourself and also you have
03:41 - multiplier which is getting a complete
03:43 - revamp in 2019 reason number six assets
03:46 - store the SSR is an excellent tool for
03:48 - getting up and running very quickly now
03:50 - just like any tool it can be used for
03:52 - good or for evil you get a lot of people
03:55 - complaining about SS flips on Steam and
03:57 - rights only so downloading a complete
03:59 - game pack and putting it on Steam is not
04:01 - the same as actually making a game but
04:03 - still don't let that discourage you from
04:04 - browsing the assets or you can find
04:07 - anything there from models to textures
04:08 - to sounds and really complex scripting
04:11 - tools like pathfinding or camera tools
04:12 - you can also get official completed
04:15 - games to hungry see how things are made
04:17 - just recently they put out the FPS
04:19 - complete FAQ which shows a complete
04:21 - multiplayer FPS in
04:22 - just make sure whatever you get actually
04:25 - makes sense and is adapted to fit into
04:27 - your game reason number seven future
04:29 - road map you can check out their road
04:31 - map on the website to see what features
04:33 - they're currently working on the most
04:35 - exciting one for me is the entity
04:36 - component system which promises
04:38 - extremely fast execution so you can have
04:40 - tens of thousands of units all at once
04:42 - then you also have other cool upcoming
04:44 - features like a complete revamp of the
04:46 - terrain system and also completely new
04:48 - multiplayer tools also there are
04:51 - improvements to the garbage collector
04:52 - who have assembly new input system and
04:54 - many more being able to see the road map
04:57 - is great because it gives you confidence
04:58 - that the engine will continue to get
04:59 - supported for a very long time so there
05:02 - you have it seven reasons to use unity
05:04 - in 2019 as I said this really is the
05:07 - best time to get started doing game
05:08 - development just a decade ago which
05:10 - would have cost tens of millions of
05:11 - dollars to get an engine with this much
05:13 - power and nowadays it's completely free
05:15 - and you can actually have many engines
05:17 - to choose from so go get the free
05:19 - version right now and get to work if you
05:22 - have any questions post them in the
05:23 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
05:24 - them so far for more videos and I'll see
05:26 - you next time
