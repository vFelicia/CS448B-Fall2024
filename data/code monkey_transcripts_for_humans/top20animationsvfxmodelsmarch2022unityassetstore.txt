00:47 - developer as the all-in-one sprite
00:49 - shader that i covered in a review then
00:51 - if you need more cinti assets over here
00:52 - is a really nice modular fantasy hero

01:00 - and a bunch more stuff so check out the
01:02 - sail and see if anything you're
01:03 - interested in is currently this gun
01:05 - alright so starting off with the latest
01:07 - cinti polygon package as you know i'm a
01:09 - huge fan of their style however i'm
01:11 - definitely not a fan of horror games i
01:12 - scare way too easily but visually the
01:14 - pack is excellent as usual so if you're
01:17 - working on a horror game and you need a
01:18 - spooky mansion with tons of creepy
01:20 - things then check it out and up next a
01:22 - bunch of character effects it's even
01:24 - using cinti characters to demonstrate it
01:26 - but this works on any mesh quite a lot
01:28 - of effects you've got some basic ones
01:30 - and some more interesting ones like
01:32 - making a character turn into stone then
01:34 - if you want to build a realistic city
01:36 - with some high-end realistic assets look
01:38 - at this one it looks really gorgeous
01:40 - really high in models and textures has a
01:42 - simple scene with day night cycle and
01:44 - even a rain toggle right now it's hdrp
01:47 - only but apparently there's a urp
01:48 - version coming soon or maybe you want to
01:50 - do some work in game so here's a bunch
01:52 - of power tools very high in models with
01:55 - a really nice look it has tons and tons
01:57 - of variety i don't even recognize half
01:59 - these tools then over here is a fun one
02:01 - it's a whole bunch of textures meant for
02:03 - making visual effects over 600 textures
02:06 - you've got lots of slashes explosions
02:08 - wind icons and more for me this one
02:10 - actually showed up as free i think it's
02:12 - because i already have the all-in-one
02:14 - vfx toolkit pack
02:15 - that one is an excellent tool for making
02:17 - visual effects and these textures are
02:19 - part of it and this one is also by the
02:21 - same developer that made the all-in-one
02:22 - sprite shader which is an excellent
02:24 - asset that i covered in a dedicated
02:26 - asset review video then if you're having
02:28 - some shader performance issues maybe
02:29 - look at this one it's a great looking
02:31 - mobile optimized shader it's got tons of
02:34 - features tons of texture maps you can
02:36 - add to make all kinds of visual looks
02:38 - and again it's supposedly extremely
02:39 - performant then here's a fun one a
02:42 - fantasy map creator it features more
02:44 - than 100 different landscape elements
02:46 - and objects lots of types of paper both
02:48 - with and without patterns in a huge
02:50 - resolution and if you're making a game
02:52 - with some aliens then this one looks
02:54 - like the perfect environment you've got
02:56 - lots of weird shapes with some pulsating
02:58 - animation and visuals all of them with
03:01 - some really high end textures looks
03:02 - really great especially when pointing a
03:04 - flashlight and if you have an alien game
03:06 - then chances are you also need a
03:08 - spaceship so look at this one it's a
03:10 - spaceship with fully built interiors
03:12 - it's got a nice realistic art style some
03:14 - sliding doors a cockpit thrusters and
03:16 - much more up next here's a great looking
03:18 - aztec temple this is the kind of thing
03:20 - that would fit perfectly in a tomb
03:22 - raider or uncharted kind of like game
03:25 - these are very high-end models with tons
03:26 - of modular pieces then for some vfx
03:29 - here's a bunch of earth skills
03:31 - there are some hits falling rocks raised
03:33 - walls spikes and more i really like the
03:35 - puffs of smoke on this one they've got a
03:37 - really high frame count makes it feel
03:38 - really satisfying for something pretty
03:41 - unique here is a clothing store
03:43 - i guess if you have some kind of open
03:45 - world game in a large city then this one
03:47 - could be the interior to whatever
03:48 - clothes shop you have
03:50 - up next if you want some orcs with some
03:51 - modular pieces look at this one
03:54 - lots of parts you can enable or disable
03:56 - so just with this pack will give you
03:58 - pretty much infinite variety it's a nice
04:00 - style it's low quality but not made by
04:02 - cindy studios and i think it looks great
04:04 - or maybe you just need some vfx look at
04:06 - this one features 60 projectiles you've
04:09 - got tons of orbs spells fireballs arrows
04:11 - and much more then over here is a nice
04:13 - looking forest with tons of vegetation
04:16 - these are some high quality world scan
04:18 - assets so they all have perfect scale
04:20 - and great textures up next over here is
04:22 - a modular soldier the proportions and
04:25 - material makes it look like this is
04:27 - taken straight from fortnite so
04:29 - definitely that style if you want it
04:30 - it's got quite a lot of parts and if you
04:32 - like this specific style then dev has
04:34 - tons more then for some 2d here's a
04:36 - bunch of parallax backgrounds they
04:39 - contain several layers so you can really
04:40 - give your 2d game lots of depth
04:43 - features various styles including forest
04:45 - desert swamp and more for some more 2d
04:48 - if you're working on a pixel art game
04:49 - and you need some tiles here's a nice
04:51 - pack it's got over 700 tiles lots of
04:54 - variety
04:55 - you have caves buildings inside and
