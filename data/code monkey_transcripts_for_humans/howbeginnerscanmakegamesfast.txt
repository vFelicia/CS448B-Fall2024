00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey if
00:02 - you're a beginner just getting started
00:03 - with Game Dev it can actually be quite
00:05 - overwhelming learning all the different
00:06 - disciplines that are required to make
00:08 - just a single complete Game you
00:10 - basically need to learn how to use the
00:11 - engine then you need to learn
00:12 - programming you need to learn how to do
00:14 - some Art 3D modeling animation sound
00:16 - design music UI ux and so on you need to
00:19 - learn how to make Health Systems level
00:20 - systems pathf finding how to do some
00:22 - artificial intelligence State machines
00:24 - spines water lights World streaming Safe
00:26 - Systems and tons tons more the list for
00:28 - all the things needed to make an entire
00:30 - complete game is nearly endless for a
00:32 - beginner the prospect of having to learn
00:34 - all of this at once just make your very
00:35 - first game can definitely seem quite
00:37 - daunting it is indeed quite a lot of
00:38 - stuff looking at all of this everything
00:40 - that is required to make a game really
00:42 - makes you think how it's actually a
00:43 - miracle how any game ever gets completed
00:46 - personally when it comes to learning I
00:47 - highly recommend you focus on making
00:49 - multiple small games as opposed to just
00:50 - one really massive game and one way to
00:52 - do that to make multiple games quickly
00:55 - is to actually focus on just the
00:56 - unlimited number of all these required
00:58 - skills just focus on Unlimited a number
01:00 - of them instead of trying to learn all
01:01 - of them for your very first project so
01:03 - if you are a beginner and you want to
01:04 - learn how to make games then one option
01:06 - is just make tons and tons of prototypes
01:08 - that's a valid way to learn however I
01:10 - also highly encourage you to take those
01:11 - projects to completion there are so many
01:13 - challenges that really only show up at
01:15 - the end of a project and if all you do
01:17 - is really just prototypes then you're
01:18 - never really going to learn about those
01:20 - so my advice is to make complete games
01:22 - small games of course make them as small
01:23 - as possible and in order to do all of
01:25 - that and still learn my advice is to
01:27 - really just focus on learning a handful
01:28 - of these things per project and then
01:30 - plug your skill gaps with some assets I
01:32 - believe this is a much better approach
01:33 - as opposed to trying to build it all
01:35 - yourself all on your own on your very
01:37 - first project which for the most part
01:39 - usually ends up with really just
01:40 - abandoned projects that's what happens
01:41 - to most people so focusing on learning
01:44 - just one skill per project is probably
01:45 - going to help you actually reach the end
01:48 - and end up with a complete game that you
01:49 - can actually play and for that the SSR
01:51 - is an absolutely invaluable tool to help
01:53 - you make your own games you can get
01:55 - pretty much anything you need whether it
01:56 - be some complex systems some models
01:58 - animations or literally anything there's
02:00 - tons of free stuff and tons of paid
02:02 - stuff Unity sponsored this video because
02:04 - their spring sale has just started which
02:06 - features over 300 of the best assets at
02:08 - 50% off since these are picked from the
02:10 - top assets on the store literally every
02:12 - single one of these is excellent so if
02:14 - you were to just randomly buy something
02:16 - absolutely at random you definitely
02:17 - could not go wrong and on top of the
02:19 - regular discount there are some really
02:21 - awesome Flash Deals at 70% off that
02:23 - refresh every day I highly recommend
02:25 - that you bookmark this page and check it
02:26 - very regularly in order to see if
02:28 - there's anything you want on a really
02:29 - nice see discount all the links are down
02:31 - in the description I'm going to browse
02:33 - the S and highlight my favorite ones
02:34 - that I think you should get in a little
02:35 - bit but before that back to the original
02:38 - topic for example for your first game
02:40 - let's say you'd like to make some kind
02:41 - of souls like Adventure game now making
02:43 - a game like this actually involves quite
02:45 - a lot of disciplines quite a lot of
02:46 - skills so maybe for example for your
02:48 - first project you really just want to
02:49 - focus on your programming skills visuals
02:51 - are actually the easiest thing to pick
02:53 - up from the store so first you need a
02:55 - character it could be straight from this
02:56 - pack in fact with just this one pack you
02:58 - could make all the characters in your
02:59 - your entire game then of course a
03:01 - character is going to need some
03:02 - animations so it could be from this
03:03 - sword animation pack after that you need
03:05 - some kind of environment so you could
03:07 - combine it with this gorgeous medieval
03:09 - castle for something really nice and
03:11 - then games need some kind of enemy so
03:12 - you could grab some enemies from this
03:14 - giant pack put all that together and
03:15 - here is a super simple game that I built
03:17 - myself in a few hours I built this while
03:19 - only focusing on my main skill set
03:21 - programming and using some assets in
03:23 - order to plug my skill gaps you could
03:24 - build this exact same thing yourself
03:26 - either as a complete project or as a
03:28 - learning project by picking up these
03:30 - visional assets you could focus solely
03:32 - on the logic part of making your game
03:34 - and even in terms of logic maybe you
03:35 - want to focus just on something like
03:37 - making a combat system or a wor spawning
03:39 - system meaning you can also get help for
03:41 - building all the other systems so
03:43 - instead of building a health system from
03:44 - scratch you can pick up my own health
03:46 - system asset which is free and it's
03:48 - actually pretty robust then instead of
03:49 - building your own safe system you can
03:51 - use Easy Save which is one of the
03:53 - highest rated asset on the store maybe
03:54 - instead of building your own custom
03:55 - saate machine maybe you could use
03:57 - something like Behavior designer andad
03:59 - of spending a mon of time researching
04:01 - how to do some really efficient really
04:03 - cool destruction instead of all that
04:04 - time you could just buy a tool like rire
04:07 - if you put all of that together you have
04:08 - a really great complete game while also
04:10 - gaining a ton of knowledge in the
04:12 - process as opposed to what I said in the
04:13 - beginning which is if you try doing
04:15 - everything yourself chances are you're
04:16 - probably just going to quit the project
04:18 - Midway through so basally my advice for
04:20 - the beginners is make tons of small
04:21 - games and focus on just learning one
04:23 - specific thing per each game and then
04:25 - use the accur in order to plug your
04:27 - skill apps that's really one of the best
04:29 - ways to use the sess story effectively
04:30 - in your Game Dev Journey or
04:31 - alternatively maybe you just suddenly
04:33 - came up with an interesting game design
04:35 - idea that you want to test out in a
04:36 - prototype really quickly for that you
04:38 - can use the multitude of really
04:40 - excellent game templates on the store
04:42 - like one of the highest rated ones is
04:43 - this one top down engine like name
04:45 - implies this helps you create games from
04:47 - a topown perspective super easily so
04:49 - starting from a template like this one
04:51 - can save you a ton of time you can
04:52 - basically very very quickly just
04:54 - validate your game idea before you end
04:56 - up putting months or years into it these
04:58 - can really help speed up your
04:59 - development at least in the Pro timing
05:01 - stage so perhaps you test out the idea
05:03 - in order to see if it does work and then
05:04 - if it does perhaps you keep building
05:06 - upon it or maybe rebuild everything from
05:08 - scratch both options are perfectly valid
05:10 - but by using these assets this really
05:12 - helps speed up the pro timing stage so
05:14 - you can test and validate your idea
05:16 - again before you put any significant
05:18 - amount of time into it and even for non-
05:20 - beginners like myself the ssur is still
05:22 - an invaluable tool the main H case that
05:24 - I mentioned a while ago using it to plug
05:25 - your skill gaps it is absolutely still
05:27 - applicable to non- beginners like in my
05:29 - case I'm a programmer that's my skill
05:31 - set I am not an artist I am not a 3D
05:34 - modeler or animator so for my last game
05:36 - than you Gardians the only way that I
05:37 - was able to build that game was by using
05:39 - assets I didn't use that many code
05:41 - assets since that's my main skill set so
05:43 - I built pretty much all the code myself
05:45 - but I absolutely use the accur for
05:47 - pretty much the entire visual side of
05:49 - the game the buildings were from an
05:50 - asset pack then the customizable
05:52 - characters from another one the dinkies
05:54 - also came from a pack and so on I bought
05:56 - all the animations I bought some shaders
05:58 - some particles also use some really
06:00 - super awesome tools to help me polish
06:02 - the game namely feel and text animator
06:04 - if I had not used the ssur at all if I
06:06 - had not used any assets then the game
06:08 - would simply look much worse if I had to
06:10 - make all div Visions myself and also it
06:12 - would have taken 10 times longer since
06:14 - I'm really not as efficient at 3D
06:15 - modeling as a proper 3D modeler so by
06:18 - using assets to plug my skill gaps I was
06:20 - able to work much faster and make a much
06:22 - better game one asset that I've use in
06:23 - pretty much all my seam games is the AAR
06:25 - pathfinding project this is an insanely
06:27 - fast pathfinding asset I starting using
06:30 - it 10 years ago for my game Survivor
06:31 - Squad I use it back then because I need
06:33 - path finding for hundreds of units and
06:36 - back then I did not have the skills to
06:37 - be able to write some efficient
06:39 - multi-threaded code however nowadays
06:40 - nowadays I actually do have that skill I
06:43 - could write some pre-performance
06:44 - multi-threaded pathfinding system if I
06:46 - wanted to but doing so would cost me
06:48 - quite a ton of time and given how I Dre
06:50 - to spend that time doing many other
06:51 - things I really value time more than
06:53 - money I got no problem paying a few
06:55 - bucks to buy an asset that someone
06:57 - already spent a th000 hours building so
06:59 - with assets other than just pluging your
07:00 - skill gaps even if you do have that
07:02 - skill you can still pick up asset to
07:03 - save you a ton of time you can spend
07:05 - just a little bit of money to save
07:06 - thousands of hours and in this specific
07:08 - case I really don't think I even bought
07:10 - this s on a sale so I think I probably
07:11 - paid 150 bucks for it 10 years ago and
07:14 - it has certainly been worth it I mean
07:16 - like I said I've used it in pretty much
07:18 - every single one of my games and
07:19 - throughout all of those I have grossed
07:21 - over a million dollars so spending 150
07:23 - bucks 10 years ago to allow me to do all
07:25 - this that was definitely a very
07:26 - worthwhile purchase just remember that
07:27 - assets are really just to old to help
07:29 - you make your games if you're making
07:30 - games just for fun if you enjoy doing 3D
07:33 - modeling or programming and your go is
07:35 - simply fun if so then by all means
07:36 - continue building everything yourself
07:38 - but if your main goal is having a
07:39 - complete game at the end then using
07:41 - assets can really help save you a ton of
07:43 - time on that journey and make your game
07:44 - better in the end also let me make just
07:46 - one quick note if you're the kind of
07:47 - person who doesn't want to use assets
07:49 - for fear that players won't turn on you
07:51 - if so then let me point you to a video
07:52 - that I made quite a while ago on that
07:54 - exact topic basically the TDR of that
07:56 - video is players do not care all that
07:57 - players want are really just fun games
07:59 - to play if your game is fun then that's
08:01 - all that matters it does not matter if
08:03 - you bought the assets or you built
08:04 - everything from scratch you don't get
08:06 - bonus points for doing it all yourself
08:08 - in the end really the players just care
08:09 - about the end result they just care that
08:11 - the game is fun to play so definitely go
08:13 - ahead and use every tool that your
08:14 - disposable to make the best game you can
08:16 - make so with that said let's browse the
08:17 - spring cell and I'll tell you which ones
08:19 - I highly recommend that can save you a
08:20 - ton of time right here from the main
08:22 - page now in terms of visuals it's
08:24 - obviously dependent on what style you're
08:25 - going for but if you like low poly
08:27 - personally I'm a huge fan of the
08:28 - cynthian low poly Style or for effects
08:30 - Gabriel has a ton of really awesome
08:32 - partical effects the assd inventory is
08:34 - definitely one excellent tool this one
08:36 - basically lets you easily search upon
08:37 - the thousands of assets that you may
08:39 - have to find very specific things it's
08:41 - especially useful if you like me also
08:43 - bought a bunch of asset packs on Humble
08:44 - Bundle you can import those into this
08:46 - tool and make them easily searchable if
08:48 - you want character customization in your
08:49 - game then I highly recommend this pack
08:52 - this is exactly the same pack that I
08:53 - used in my game dink Guardians and it's
08:55 - also the pack that I included when I
08:57 - made the character customization system
08:59 - you can download the project files for
09:01 - that one which was made exactly using
09:02 - this pack then you can also go watch all
09:04 - of my asset review videos pretty much
09:06 - every single one of these assets is
09:07 - excellent so I can definitely H
09:09 - recommend all of these then in terms of
09:10 - flashh deals I bought this pack ages ago
09:13 - and it has been extremely useful it's
09:15 - got all kinds of animations for all
09:16 - kinds of things I recommend you pick up
09:18 - a giant bundle with tons of assets
09:20 - whenever you need to do some kind of
09:21 - prototype so a pack like this one would
09:23 - be excellent if you want to make open
09:25 - world games and check out Gaia it's what
09:26 - I used last year when I made my open
09:28 - world game I've already mentioned field
09:30 - this is an excellent one for adding all
09:31 - kinds of Polish to your game and text
09:33 - animator which is another must you can
09:35 - very easily make your text come alive so
09:37 - whether you're a beginner or an advanced
09:38 - user I high recommend use the accur to
09:41 - plug your skill gaps do this instead of
09:42 - trying to build everything yourself the
09:44 - spring sale is live right now and this
09:46 - one contains some of the best sets on
09:47 - the store so definitely take advantage
09:49 - of this time if you need anything check

09:53 - flashh deals for those super deep
09:55 - discounts all right so thanks for
09:56 - watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey if you're a beginner just getting started with Game Dev it can actually be quite overwhelming learning all the different disciplines that are required to make just a single complete Game you basically need to learn how to use the engine then you need to learn programming you need to learn how to do some Art 3D modeling animation sound design music UI ux and so on you need to learn how to make Health Systems level systems pathf finding how to do some artificial intelligence State machines spines water lights World streaming Safe Systems and tons tons more the list for all the things needed to make an entire complete game is nearly endless for a beginner the prospect of having to learn all of this at once just make your very first game can definitely seem quite daunting it is indeed quite a lot of stuff looking at all of this everything that is required to make a game really makes you think how it's actually a miracle how any game ever gets completed personally when it comes to learning I highly recommend you focus on making multiple small games as opposed to just one really massive game and one way to do that to make multiple games quickly is to actually focus on just the unlimited number of all these required skills just focus on Unlimited a number of them instead of trying to learn all of them for your very first project so if you are a beginner and you want to learn how to make games then one option is just make tons and tons of prototypes that's a valid way to learn however I also highly encourage you to take those projects to completion there are so many challenges that really only show up at the end of a project and if all you do is really just prototypes then you're never really going to learn about those so my advice is to make complete games small games of course make them as small as possible and in order to do all of that and still learn my advice is to really just focus on learning a handful of these things per project and then plug your skill gaps with some assets I believe this is a much better approach as opposed to trying to build it all yourself all on your own on your very first project which for the most part usually ends up with really just abandoned projects that's what happens to most people so focusing on learning just one skill per project is probably going to help you actually reach the end and end up with a complete game that you can actually play and for that the SSR is an absolutely invaluable tool to help you make your own games you can get pretty much anything you need whether it be some complex systems some models animations or literally anything there's tons of free stuff and tons of paid stuff Unity sponsored this video because their spring sale has just started which features over 300 of the best assets at 50% off since these are picked from the top assets on the store literally every single one of these is excellent so if you were to just randomly buy something absolutely at random you definitely could not go wrong and on top of the regular discount there are some really awesome Flash Deals at 70% off that refresh every day I highly recommend that you bookmark this page and check it very regularly in order to see if there's anything you want on a really nice see discount all the links are down in the description I'm going to browse the S and highlight my favorite ones that I think you should get in a little bit but before that back to the original topic for example for your first game let's say you'd like to make some kind of souls like Adventure game now making a game like this actually involves quite a lot of disciplines quite a lot of skills so maybe for example for your first project you really just want to focus on your programming skills visuals are actually the easiest thing to pick up from the store so first you need a character it could be straight from this pack in fact with just this one pack you could make all the characters in your your entire game then of course a character is going to need some animations so it could be from this sword animation pack after that you need some kind of environment so you could combine it with this gorgeous medieval castle for something really nice and then games need some kind of enemy so you could grab some enemies from this giant pack put all that together and here is a super simple game that I built myself in a few hours I built this while only focusing on my main skill set programming and using some assets in order to plug my skill gaps you could build this exact same thing yourself either as a complete project or as a learning project by picking up these visional assets you could focus solely on the logic part of making your game and even in terms of

that can save you a ton of time right here from the main page now in terms of visuals it's obviously dependent on what style you're going for but if you like low poly personally I'm a huge fan of the cynthian low poly Style or for effects Gabriel has a ton of really awesome partical effects the assd inventory is definitely one excellent tool this one basically lets you easily search upon the thousands of assets that you may have to find very specific things it's especially useful if you like me also bought a bunch of asset packs on Humble Bundle you can import those into this tool and make them easily searchable if you want character customization in your game then I highly recommend this pack this is exactly the same pack that I used in my game dink Guardians and it's also the pack that I included when I made the character customization system you can download the project files for that one which was made exactly using this pack then you can also go watch all of my asset review videos pretty much every single one of these assets is excellent so I can definitely H recommend all of these then in terms of flashh deals I bought this pack ages ago and it has been extremely useful it's got all kinds of animations for all kinds of things I recommend you pick up a giant bundle with tons of assets whenever you need to do some kind of prototype so a pack like this one would be excellent if you want to make open world games and check out Gaia it's what I used last year when I made my open world game I've already mentioned field this is an excellent one for adding all kinds of Polish to your game and text animator which is another must you can very easily make your text come alive so whether you're a beginner or an advanced user I high recommend use the accur to plug your skill gaps do this instead of trying to build everything yourself the spring sale is live right now and this one contains some of the best sets on the store so definitely take advantage of this time if you need anything check the link description and like I said definitely keep a close eye on the flashh deals for those super deep discounts all right so thanks for watching and I'll see
