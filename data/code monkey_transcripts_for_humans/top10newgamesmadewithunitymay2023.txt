00:03 - games made with NT launch in June 23.
00:05 - there's lots of variety this month some
00:07 - very chill and calming games others are
00:09 - very dark and Moody some surprising hits
00:11 - and lots of unique interesting mechanics
00:13 - the reason why I make these videos is to
00:15 - show you everything that the engine can
00:16 - do the only limit is really just your
00:18 - own skills and Imagination and the
00:19 - variety and the awesomeness of the game
00:21 - shown here really puts out to the test
00:22 - all of these games are uniquely
00:24 - impressive so the list is in no
00:25 - particular order except for the number
00:26 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:28 - month by the way I'm currently working
00:29 - insanely hard to get my game demo ready
00:31 - for the Sim Festival next week I've
00:33 - implemented something like 10 different
00:34 - mechanics this week really productive
00:36 - the game is really starting to take
00:37 - shape I can't wait to have you on play
00:39 - it I really hope you like it make sure
00:41 - you add it to your wishlist stay tuned
00:42 - for a testing live stream this weekend
00:44 - and go play it on Monday alright so
00:46 - starting off at number 10 with a very
00:48 - successful Indie sequel here is darkest
00:50 - dungeon 2. this one builds upon the
00:52 - original if you don't know this game
00:54 - features a very punishing but also very
00:56 - satisfying road trip through a very
00:58 - dangerous world where you not only fight
01:00 - some creatures but also your own inner
01:02 - demons you fight with some nice
01:03 - turn-based combat using all kinds of
01:05 - abilities and spells that also take into
01:07 - account positioning each hero is also
01:09 - unique with their own story that you can
01:10 - uncover in every run and it's also a
01:13 - roguelike where each run lets anywhere
01:14 - from 30 minutes to several hours and you
01:16 - keep getting some persistent upgrades
01:18 - every run is unique and every run leads
01:20 - to different encounters with different
01:21 - Heroes as you'll learn more about this
01:23 - world the reviews were actually a bit
01:25 - polarizing in the beginning when this
01:26 - came out plenty of FIFA did not like
01:28 - some big changes from the original but
01:30 - the recent reviews are much more
01:31 - positive so it seems like they will
01:33 - listen to feedback and improve the game
01:34 - significantly during Early Access next
01:36 - series a very good looking puzzle
01:38 - Adventure game called planet of Lana
01:40 - this was one of the big standouts of e3
01:42 - two years ago visually it has a very
01:45 - unique style very flat colors which
01:47 - looks surprisingly great it's an
01:49 - adventure puzzle platformer which this
01:51 - is usually a genre where it's really
01:53 - difficult to find success you really
01:54 - need something that looks excellent just
01:56 - like this one to stand out it also helps
01:58 - how the game has a really cute cat-like
02:00 - creature that follows you around it
02:02 - features some excellent design and music
02:03 - really fantastic visas and some
02:05 - cinematic scenes so if you don't like
02:07 - story Focus games and this one looks
02:09 - great already has over 700 reviews at 94
02:12 - positive so people seem to love it for
02:14 - something quite a bit more hardcore with
02:16 - a nice mix of genres here is silica it's
02:18 - a nice mix of first person shooter
02:20 - combined with an RTS personally I always
02:22 - enjoy this mix in theory even though in
02:24 - practice sectionally real and difficult
02:25 - to make it work in the Australian layer
02:27 - you can guide your units placed on
02:29 - buildings set some orders and harvest
02:31 - resources then you can dive down into
02:33 - first person and engage into some
02:34 - intense first person combat you can
02:36 - fight as in infantry or drive around
02:38 - some very weighty very powerful vehicles
02:40 - and engage the aliens and one really
02:42 - awesome thing is how you can also play
02:44 - as the alien faction you can control
02:46 - some weird bug-like creatures to take
02:48 - out the Infantry really interesting you
02:50 - can play either Solo or with friends in
02:52 - either Co-op or PVP it's made by
02:54 - Bohemian interactive the armor developer
02:56 - it's out now and already has almost 2
02:59 - 000 very positive reviews then for some
03:01 - VR here is requisition VR this one
03:03 - caught my eye right away because it has
03:05 - a fascinating mechanic where you duct
03:07 - tape objects together to make some
03:08 - weapons definitely a very unique
03:10 - mechanic which is actually perfect when
03:11 - combined with VR for the actual physical
03:13 - action of putting on duct tape then each
03:15 - object has tons of attach points you can
03:17 - attach pretty much anything anywhere you
03:19 - want like for example you can attach
03:21 - some kind of rotating machine to a
03:23 - shovel to make a really nice offensive
03:24 - weapon or perhaps you can simply attach
03:26 - a spike to a wooden pallet and use it as
03:28 - kind of like a shield slash weapon combo
03:31 - everything is on physics based so you
03:33 - can throw objects or pick them up you
03:34 - can use a crowbar to break doors or use
03:36 - pistols to take out the zombies you can
03:38 - explore this interesting town or
03:40 - dungeons in either Solo or KOA the
03:42 - reviews are mostly positive so there's a
03:44 - little bit of Jank but the core concept
03:46 - is really unique then here is macabellon
03:48 - this one is an epic Auto battler where
03:50 - you command an army of awesome
03:52 - customizable mechs you create your units
03:54 - you can select their gear and type so
03:56 - you can make some light or some heavy
03:58 - units then you set up their placement
03:59 - really think strategically about where
04:02 - each unit goes then you watch as the mam
04:04 - happens as massive amounts of units
04:06 - destroy each other in a really
04:07 - satisfying manner visually the game
04:09 - looks really excellent the units feel
04:11 - really weighty and the explosions are
04:12 - really explosive the game is all about
04:14 - tweaking your units to defeat the enemy
04:16 - you can play another single player or
04:18 - against humans in PvP mode it's got over
04:20 - 1500 very positive reviews despite the
04:23 - launching in Early Access so this one is
04:25 - off to a very strong start then here's
04:27 - something which I would have guessed is
04:28 - pretty Niche but it's actually finding
04:30 - massive success it's called tape to tape
04:32 - it's a ice hockey game and one twist is
04:35 - how it has broken Light Elements which
04:36 - is certainly an interesting addition to
04:38 - the sports game and at the same time
04:40 - your players also have abilities and
04:42 - Synergy so it's really not meant as a
04:44 - serious sport game you've got a fun
04:46 - grappling hook you can throw to grab
04:48 - opponents you can throw your stick and
04:50 - knock people out or you can even bribe
04:52 - the rep so it definitely takes a more
04:53 - wacky approach there's a nice
04:55 - progression where you go from game to
04:57 - game trying to restore your team to its
04:59 - former glory it also has both online and
05:01 - local multiplayer which is actually
05:03 - pretty rare nowadays it has already got
05:05 - over a thousand very positive reviews
05:06 - even though it's only in Early Access so
05:09 - this one looks like a huge hit next if
05:11 - you enjoy building colonization then
05:12 - check out occupy Mars the game like name
05:15 - implies the goal is to colonize and
05:16 - occupy Mars you arrive at a Barren
05:19 - Wasteland and it's up to you to colonize
05:21 - the planet and turn it into a second
05:22 - home this is very much a Sandbox game
05:25 - you gather resources grow food repair
05:27 - some complex equipment build and upgrade
05:29 - your base and explore the World the game
05:31 - is highly technical with lots of very
05:33 - realistic systems you need to take care
05:35 - to generate enough power you need to use
05:37 - that power to generate water and oxygen
05:39 - you can conduct mining operations set up
05:42 - some greenhouses and be careful with the
05:44 - temperature you can also work on your
05:46 - Rover you can change the Hydraulics
05:48 - operate the robot arm modify the mining
05:50 - rig and much more so the game really has
05:52 - an emphasis on realism and physics
05:54 - there's a little bit of Jank with 800
05:56 - mostly positive reviews but if you don't
05:58 - like hyper realistic sandboxes then give
06:00 - it a try next here is an interesting one
06:02 - with a strange name it's called above
06:04 - snakes it's a chill Wild West inspired
06:06 - RPG with lots of items lots of crafting
06:08 - building and survival elements the most
06:10 - important mechanic is how you explore
06:12 - and build the world and you do that one
06:14 - time at a time as you approach The Edge
06:16 - you can decide what the next time will
06:17 - be will you add a fur style for some
06:19 - food or maybe something with some
06:21 - enemies for some combat it features a
06:23 - really nice and complex house building
06:24 - system you can build your own house from
06:26 - tons of different tiles to get it
06:28 - looking exactly as you want it you can
06:29 - add a crafting station to craft some
06:31 - food and some weapons you can smell some
06:33 - iron weave some clothes or cut some wood
06:35 - if you want to learn how to make a
06:36 - husband building system just like this
06:38 - one I actually made a fun tutorial quite
06:40 - a while ago then sometimes also have
06:42 - unique NPCs which you can chat with and
06:43 - get some quests all in all it's a really
06:45 - nice mix of building an adventure with
06:47 - an interesting unique mechanic I saw a
06:49 - spider cat play this game a few months
06:51 - ago and it seemed really enjoyable it is
06:52 - out now and is doing decently well with
06:54 - 600 mostly positive reviews then for
06:57 - something very relaxing here is Panorama
06:59 - it's a very peaceful City Building
07:01 - puzzle game you've got a set of tiles
07:03 - and you place them down one by one some
07:05 - are just a simple forest or river others
07:07 - have some tiny houses and some occupy
07:10 - multiple tiles with an interesting
07:11 - structure some buildings also have
07:13 - bonuses like for example I'm placing
07:14 - down a windmill will automatically place
07:16 - down a bunch of wheat tiles there's also
07:18 - some cute animals and of course you can
07:20 - get points just for petting them one
07:22 - thing that really stands out to me on
07:24 - the trailer is how satisfying are the
07:25 - sound effects every time a new town was
07:28 - revealingly feeling so calming and so
07:29 - satisfying I'm personally not someone
07:31 - who usually notices sound effects too
07:33 - much so the fact that I noticed these
07:34 - really says a lot so if you want a very
07:36 - chill times then definitely give this a
07:38 - try it has almost 300 very positive
07:40 - reviews and at number one for my
07:42 - personal pick of the month here is an
07:43 - interesting simulator called flashing
07:45 - lights the simulator games are sometimes
07:47 - very janky but this one seems to be well
07:49 - made you can play as either a cop
07:51 - firefighter or medic each with unique
07:53 - missions and gear as a cop you can
07:55 - engage in car chases criminal incidents
07:57 - or hostage scenarios or perhaps you want
08:00 - to play As A Firefighter and put out
08:01 - some dangerous fires or simply save
08:03 - someone's life as a medic the
08:05 - conjunction of all three separate roles
08:06 - is really interesting when played with
08:08 - friends I assume this can be quite a lot
08:10 - of fun you can play either Solo or with
08:12 - 10 people for either fun or some serious
08:14 - roleplay each of the three let's say
08:16 - classes they all seem to have quite a
08:18 - lot of actions so police can stop
08:19 - carches with spikes firefighters can
08:22 - carry people and Medics can place them
08:23 - on stretchers I'd love to try this one
08:25 - out to see how they made all of these
08:27 - Mechanics Work there's also an
08:28 - interesting Universe of player created
