With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video we're going to explore how
00:01 - to use the unity town up
00:03 - this is the built-in unity tool that
00:05 - helps you quickly and easily build
00:06 - worlds with town sprites
00:08 - let's begin
00:09 - [Music]
00:14 - okay so let's check out how the town map
00:16 - works now i've already covered the video
00:18 - previously
00:18 - on how to build a custom tile map so
00:21 - that one was built from scratch using a
00:23 - custom grid class
00:24 - so that one is great if you want to
00:26 - really dig into the code and really
00:28 - understand how the whole thing works
00:30 - but if all you want is a normal tile map
00:32 - then you can just use the built-in unity
00:34 - tile map
00:34 - so let's see how to use it over here is
00:37 - my basic empty scene
00:38 - so i have a character walking around
00:40 - just for fun alright so let's set up a
00:42 - towel map
00:43 - now the first thing you need is the 2d
00:45 - packages
00:46 - if you already created the project using
00:48 - the 2d template they should already be
00:50 - installed
00:50 - but if not you just go into window and
00:52 - open up the package manager
00:54 - and then here on the unity registry you
00:56 - just need to install the 2d packages
00:59 - so for this one we're going to need the
01:01 - 2d sprite
01:02 - so this is so we can edit our
01:04 - spreadsheet and then we're going to need
01:05 - the 2d tile map editor
01:07 - so make sure both those packages are
01:09 - installed then here we are in our nice
01:11 - empty scene
01:12 - so on the hierarchy just right click i'm
01:14 - going to create a new 2d object and
01:16 - let's make it a tile map
01:18 - so right away this creates a grid object
01:20 - and if you select it you can visually
01:22 - see the grid
01:23 - then over here you have some options so
01:25 - for example you can modify the size of
01:27 - each grid cell
01:28 - and then you can also modify the gap
01:30 - between each grid zone
01:31 - so you can really customize exactly the
01:33 - type of grid that you want so in this
01:34 - case let's leave everything a nice
01:36 - standard grid
01:37 - then you also have the cell layout so
01:40 - this means that the tile map supports
01:42 - both normal rectangular grids but also
01:44 - hexagon and izomatic grids
01:46 - and then the cell swizzle which has to
01:48 - do with converting coordinates so in
01:49 - most cases we'll just leave it at
01:51 - xyz okay so that's the grid object and
01:54 - then
01:54 - inside it you have the actual tile map
01:56 - object so over here you have the tile
01:58 - map component as well as the tile map
02:00 - render
02:00 - again with a bunch of options for
02:02 - setting the tile anchor setting the
02:04 - color
02:05 - setting a certain sorting order as well
02:07 - as the material used to render the tama
02:09 - so you can play around with all of these
02:10 - but for now let's leave it all at
02:11 - default
02:12 - now in order to start drawing our tile
02:14 - map let's go into window
02:16 - down here onto 2d and let's open up the
02:18 - tile palette
02:19 - now in this window is where we're going
02:21 - to define the palette containing all the
02:22 - sprites that we're going to use in our
02:24 - tile map
02:24 - so click on this button to create a new
02:26 - palette then give it a name
02:28 - let's say our tile map palette and let's
02:31 - set it to use a rectangular grid
02:33 - and for the cell size leave it as
02:34 - automatic all right so click on create
02:37 - then it's going to ask you for a folder
02:39 - where it will save all the sprite data
02:41 - so just make a nice new folder in order
02:42 - to keep it organized
02:44 - so for the time palette and yep over
02:47 - here on the project files we can see we
02:49 - created a new folder
02:50 - and in there we have our nice object all
02:52 - right so now here as it says just drag
02:54 - the tile sprite or texture assets in
02:56 - here
02:56 - but before we do that we need to first
02:58 - prepare our spreadsheet so over here in
03:00 - the project files i already have a nice
03:02 - texture
03:03 - so it's a pretty simple sprite sheet
03:04 - with some background textures as well as
03:06 - some objects
03:07 - so this is the same sprite sheet that i
03:09 - use in the complete visual scripting
03:11 - course that i'm currently working on
03:12 - one of the games is an action rpg where
03:14 - i only use the tile map in order to
03:16 - build the world
03:17 - so check the link in the description if
03:18 - you're interested in that course
03:20 - now the first thing we need here is to
03:21 - slice the sprite sheet into its various
03:23 - sprites
03:24 - so up here on the sprite mode change
03:26 - from single into multiple
03:27 - then on the pixels per unit make sure
03:29 - you select the correct size
03:31 - now here my texture is 248 by 2048 so
03:34 - each of these grids is 512x5 tone
03:36 - so in here just put 512 that means that
03:39 - this whole thing will occupy only one
03:40 - unit in the world
03:42 - alright so do that then hit on apply and
03:44 - then click here on the sprite
03:46 - editor so here's our sprite and we can
03:48 - click on the slice menu
03:49 - and now in here depending on how you set
03:51 - up your spreadsheet
03:52 - if everything is nicely separated then
03:54 - you can go with automatic
03:56 - but in my case that wouldn't work since
03:57 - i have objects of different sizes
03:59 - so i'm instead going to select grid by
04:01 - cell size
04:02 - let's put each cell is 5 12 by 5 12 and
04:06 - just slice
04:07 - and there you go right away everything
04:08 - is nicely sliced so there's one here one
04:10 - here one here and so on
04:12 - now i'm just going to fix these smaller
04:13 - ones
04:19 - all right so everything is good now just
04:20 - go over here and hit apply
04:22 - and right away in the project files if
04:23 - we expand our texture yep we can see
04:25 - that it individually created all of our
04:26 - sprites so there you go down down and so
04:29 - on everything looks good
04:30 - all right now all we need to do is take
04:32 - this texture object
04:34 - so just click on it and drag it right
04:35 - here onto the tile palette
04:37 - and again make another folder
04:41 - and yep there it is we can now see all
04:43 - of our individual sprites in the town
04:45 - palette
04:45 - now up here we have these buttons so we
04:48 - can select move paint arrays and so on
04:50 - and in order to draw our tongues the
04:52 - simplest one is just to click on the
04:54 - paint button
04:55 - then you click to select the tile let's
04:56 - say this one so click on it
04:58 - and then just in the world just click
05:00 - and drag and start painting
05:03 - by the way a simple quick tip just when
05:04 - you have the scene window selected
05:07 - hit shift space and put it on full
05:09 - screen and now you got a bit more space
05:11 - alright so we can use this button in
05:12 - order to paint individual tiles
05:14 - you can use this one in order to draw on
05:16 - a rectangular area
05:18 - and you have this one in order to erase
05:20 - various tiles
05:21 - and you can also select and then click
05:23 - the move and then move it around
05:25 - then as for hotkeys for example while
05:27 - you are in paint mode
05:29 - there it goes like this one and now i'm
05:30 - painting then select different one and
05:33 - paint it
05:33 - now if i want i can hold down shift and
05:35 - click and drag in order to delete
05:37 - and i can hold down control in order to
05:39 - click and select this one so select this
05:41 - one paint this one then click
05:42 - control and yep paint this one alright
05:45 - so that's the super basic tile map setup
05:47 - let me just make a basic looking map
05:59 - all right so here's my basic world now
06:01 - one thing you might notice
06:02 - depending on how you drew the sprite
06:03 - sheet is some gaps so over here you can
06:05 - see
06:06 - a little line there and there and
06:07 - especially if we zoom in yep there you
06:09 - go there's a very big line there
06:10 - so the solution to solve this is to make
06:12 - a sprite atlas
06:13 - so right here on the project files let's
06:15 - right click go into create
06:17 - and create a new sprite atlas
06:20 - and now here in the inspector you can
06:22 - see the objects for packing
06:24 - so click on the plus icon and then
06:27 - either select individually eat sprite
06:29 - or select the whole texture and then if
06:31 - you want you can play around all the
06:32 - other settings or just leave them
06:34 - at default and you can click on pack
06:36 - preview and now if we look in the game
06:38 - view we can still see there are some
06:39 - gaps
06:40 - so that's because the sprite atlas is
06:42 - only created when you actually run the
06:43 - build
06:44 - so if we try to run the game and if
06:46 - there you go there are no more gaps and
06:48 - everything looks great
06:49 - all right so far so good now another
06:51 - thing you can have in a town map is
06:53 - layers so over here we see we have the
06:55 - word object and then inside we have the
06:57 - tile map
06:58 - so it's in here that you can have
06:59 - multiple so rename this to the tile map
07:01 - background
07:02 - and then let's duplicate this one and
07:04 - named it the tile map over
07:06 - now when you do that it also duplicates
07:08 - the tiles that were already in there
07:10 - so for example if i move this tile map
07:12 - people you can see it has the same tiles
07:14 - now i want this one to have the objects
07:15 - that are going to be placed on top of
07:17 - the background
07:18 - so just erase all these in order to
07:20 - select on which tile map you are
07:22 - actually painting on
07:23 - you have in here the drop down menu for
07:25 - the active tile map so in this case i
07:27 - want to erase this one on the over tile
07:28 - map so just select that one
07:30 - and now if i click yeah there you go now
07:32 - i'm erasing this one
07:34 - and by the way if you select on control
07:36 - then you can have a bigger
07:37 - brush area so just select control select
07:40 - the whole thing and now i can erase
07:41 - everything with just one click
07:43 - all right so the overtime map is now
07:44 - empty and just reset it back on zero
07:46 - zero
07:47 - so everything is nicely positioned okay
07:49 - now we want to place some things on this
07:51 - time map that will show up on top of the
07:53 - previous one
07:54 - so on each tile map you can see the
07:55 - tilemap printer and in here you have the
07:58 - sorting layer as well as the sorting
07:59 - order so in this case let's leave the
08:01 - base one on default at zero and this one
08:03 - is meant to be on top so just put it on
08:04 - 10.
08:05 - so now if i place down some objects so
08:07 - let's say i want to print
08:09 - this little tree trunk and if there you
08:11 - go gets placed in there
08:12 - so now i want to place some of these and
08:14 - there you go i can place them
08:16 - so we now have one tama being painted on
08:18 - top of another one
08:19 - however we want this one to be in
08:21 - between the other tones so i want to
08:23 - place the sprite in between those two
08:24 - edges
08:25 - now to do that there is essentially two
08:27 - approaches so we can just move the
08:29 - time-lapse object so just move it by
08:31 - 0.5 and 0.5 and there you go now it's
08:33 - offset on each corner
08:35 - and another potential approach is to
08:36 - modify over here the tile anchor
08:38 - so at 0.5 they are being anchored in the
08:40 - center and if i put at 0 0 then they're
08:42 - now at the bottom yep just like that
08:44 - so you have those two options in this
08:46 - case let's leave the anchor at that
08:48 - and just slightly offset the tile map
08:50 - object okay so now i can place the
08:51 - sprite in between the edges
08:53 - just like that i can also place a bunch
08:55 - of other objects so there you go a
08:57 - couple of bushes
08:58 - a couple of tree trunks and so on now
09:00 - another thing you can do is modify the
09:02 - tile palette
09:03 - so over here you have a button for edit
09:05 - so click on it and now we are in edit
09:07 - mode
09:07 - so while in edit mode select the paint
09:09 - brush then control click on the one that
09:12 - we want to copy so control click
09:14 - and then let's make four of them in here
09:16 - then also control click on this one and
09:17 - make another one there
09:19 - all right so now with the select tool
09:20 - select this one and now rotate this one
09:23 - by 90 degrees
09:24 - and this one by 180 and this one by 270.
09:28 - all right so we have all these rotated
09:30 - ones and for this one rotate by 90.
09:32 - all right so there it is save the tile
09:35 - palette exit
09:36 - edit mode and now we have all these nice
09:38 - rotated sprites
09:39 - so if i want i can now perfectly place
09:41 - these ones
09:43 - see if there you go just like that
09:48 - by the way another thing you can do is
09:50 - also play around with the pivot for each
09:52 - object
09:53 - so for example on the tree trunk you can
09:55 - go into the texture go into the sprite
09:57 - editor
09:58 - here is the tree trunk and instead of
10:00 - having the pivot down middle let's move
10:01 - it down in there
10:03 - and hit apply and there you go they all
10:04 - moved automatically so you can modify
10:06 - the pivot of where the thing gets placed
10:08 - and lastly you also have options for
10:10 - scaling the tiles
10:12 - so with the select tool select each tile
10:13 - and then for example modify the scale
10:15 - 222
10:17 - and now if i try to paint this there you
10:19 - go now it paints it much bigger
10:20 - so you can really play around with any
10:22 - object on the palette now with regards
10:23 - to scaling for example i have these four
10:25 - objects which are meant to be smaller
10:26 - than one grid position
10:28 - so if i try to place the pillar right
10:30 - here that's a bit bigger i don't want it
10:31 - to be that big
10:32 - so again i can click here in order to
10:34 - modify the scale put it that much
10:36 - smaller
10:37 - and now if i try to paint it yep there
10:38 - you go it is much smaller so this works
10:40 - but this really only scales the sprites
10:42 - so the grid size is still the same so i
10:44 - cannot put them right next to each other
10:46 - so another approach is to make a brand
10:47 - new grid and set the cell size to be
10:49 - smart
10:50 - so right click create the brand new tile
10:52 - map
10:53 - which creates a new grid as well as new
10:55 - tile map so let's rename this to the
10:57 - town map details
10:59 - and on the grid itself over here we can
11:01 - modify the cell size so let's say
11:02 - 0.5 so we have this main grid and then
11:05 - we have this smaller grid
11:07 - and now in here with this active tile
11:09 - map selected i can place down these
11:10 - objects right like this
11:22 - all right so here's our world map
11:23 - composed of a background then some
11:25 - objects on top and then some smaller
11:27 - details
11:32 - now just one last thing regarding time
11:34 - maps which is adding colliders
11:35 - so for example i want these objects to
11:37 - be fully solid
11:39 - for that i'm just going to duplicate
11:41 - this time map and name this the
11:42 - town map colliders
11:48 - and then all we need to do is add the
11:50 - component of the tile map collider
11:52 - so just do that and yep it adds letters
11:54 - to all the objects so on this one just
11:55 - erase all the ones that are not the
11:57 - pillars
11:58 - so just in here erase and get rid of all
12:08 - those
12:10 - all right so i erased all the objects
12:11 - except for the pillars
12:13 - and now the character controller is
12:15 - already testing for collisions so if i
12:17 - play
12:18 - so here's my character and i can walk
12:20 - around normally and if i go towards the
12:21 - pillars no can do it can't go through
12:23 - them
12:26 - so that's how simple it is to add
12:27 - collisions onto your tile map
12:29 - and this also shows how easy it is to
12:31 - use the tile map when making a
12:33 - platformer game
12:34 - so you could draw the world using the
12:36 - town map and then just add the time map
12:37 - collector and all of a sudden
12:39 - you have platform collisions alright so
12:41 - now you know how to use the built-in
12:42 - unity tama
12:43 - it's a very versatile tool that you can
12:45 - use to build massive worlds very easily
12:47 - and if you want to see how you could
12:48 - make a custom town map from scratch go
12:50 - watch that other video
12:52 - that one is based on the grid class made
12:53 - previously which is very versatile and
12:55 - you can make it perfectly fit your needs
12:57 - but for simple cases the built-in unity
12:59 - time map is excellent and very easy to
13:01 - use
13:01 - now like i said the sprite sheet i'm
13:02 - using here is from the complete visual
13:04 - scripting course that i'm currently
13:05 - working on
13:06 - one of the games is an action rpg where
13:08 - i will use the tile map in order to
13:09 - build the world
13:10 - so check the link in the description if

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to explore how to use the unity town up this is the builtin unity tool that helps you quickly and easily build worlds with town sprites let's begin okay so let's check out how the town map works now i've already covered the video previously on how to build a custom tile map so that one was built from scratch using a custom grid class so that one is great if you want to really dig into the code and really understand how the whole thing works but if all you want is a normal tile map then you can just use the builtin unity tile map so let's see how to use it over here is my basic empty scene so i have a character walking around just for fun alright so let's set up a towel map now the first thing you need is the 2d packages if you already created the project using the 2d template they should already be installed but if not you just go into window and open up the package manager and then here on the unity registry you just need to install the 2d packages so for this one we're going to need the 2d sprite so this is so we can edit our spreadsheet and then we're going to need the 2d tile map editor so make sure both those packages are installed then here we are in our nice empty scene so on the hierarchy just right click i'm going to create a new 2d object and let's make it a tile map so right away this creates a grid object and if you select it you can visually see the grid then over here you have some options so for example you can modify the size of each grid cell and then you can also modify the gap between each grid zone so you can really customize exactly the type of grid that you want so in this case let's leave everything a nice standard grid then you also have the cell layout so this means that the tile map supports both normal rectangular grids but also hexagon and izomatic grids and then the cell swizzle which has to do with converting coordinates so in most cases we'll just leave it at xyz okay so that's the grid object and then inside it you have the actual tile map object so over here you have the tile map component as well as the tile map render again with a bunch of options for setting the tile anchor setting the color setting a certain sorting order as well as the material used to render the tama so you can play around with all of these but for now let's leave it all at default now in order to start drawing our tile map let's go into window down here onto 2d and let's open up the tile palette now in this window is where we're going to define the palette containing all the sprites that we're going to use in our tile map so click on this button to create a new palette then give it a name let's say our tile map palette and let's set it to use a rectangular grid and for the cell size leave it as automatic all right so click on create then it's going to ask you for a folder where it will save all the sprite data so just make a nice new folder in order to keep it organized so for the time palette and yep over here on the project files we can see we created a new folder and in there we have our nice object all right so now here as it says just drag the tile sprite or texture assets in here but before we do that we need to first prepare our spreadsheet so over here in the project files i already have a nice texture so it's a pretty simple sprite sheet with some background textures as well as some objects so this is the same sprite sheet that i use in the complete visual scripting course that i'm currently working on one of the games is an action rpg where i only use the tile map in order to build the world so check the link in the description if you're interested in that course now the first thing we need here is to slice the sprite sheet into its various sprites so up here on the sprite mode change from single into multiple then on the pixels per unit make sure you select the correct size now here my texture is 248 by 2048 so each of these grids is 512x5 tone so in here just put 512 that means that this whole thing will occupy only one unit in the world alright so do that then hit on apply and then click here on the sprite editor so here's our sprite and we can click on the slice menu and now in here depending on how you set up your spreadsheet if everything is nicely separated then you can go with automatic but in my case that wouldn't work since i have objects of different sizes so i'm instead going to select grid by cell size let's put each cell is 5 12 by 5 12 and just slice and there you go right away everything is nicely sliced so there's one here one here one here and so on now i'm just going to fix these smaller ones all right so everything is good now just go over here and hit apply and right away in the project files if we expand our texture yep we can see that it individually created all of our sprites so there you go down down and so on everything looks good all right now all we need to do is take this texture object so just click on it and drag it right here onto the tile palette and again make another folder and yep there it is we can now see all of our individual sprites in the town palette now up here we have these buttons so we can select move paint arrays and so on and in order to draw our tongues the simplest one is just to click on the paint button then you click to select the tile let's say this one so click on it and then just in the world just click and drag and start painting by the way a simple quick tip just when you have the scene window selected hit shift space and put it on full screen and now you got a bit more space alright so we can use this button in order to paint individual tiles you can use this one in order to draw on a rectangular area and you have this one in order to erase various tiles and you can also select and then click the move and then move it around then as for hotkeys for example while you are in paint mode there it goes like this one and now i'm painting then select different one and paint it now if i want i can hold down shift and click and drag in order to delete and i can hold down control in order to click and select this one so select this one paint this one then click control and yep paint this one alright so that's the super basic tile map setup let me just make a basic looking map all right so here's my basic world now one thing you might notice depending on how you drew the sprite sheet is some gaps so over here you can see a little line there and there and especially if we zoom in yep there you go there's a very big line there so the solution to solve this is to make a sprite atlas so right here on the project files let's right click go into create and create a new sprite atlas and now here in the inspector you can see the objects for packing so click on the plus icon and then either select individually eat sprite or select the whole texture and then if you want you can play around all the other settings or just leave them at default and you can click on pack preview and now if we look in the game view we can still see there are some gaps so that's because the sprite atlas is only created when you actually run the build so if we try to run the game and if there you go there are no more gaps and everything looks great all right so far so good now another thing you can have in a town map is layers so over here we see we have the word object and then inside we have the tile map so it's in here that you can have multiple so rename this to the tile map background and then let's duplicate this one and named it the tile map over now when you do that it also duplicates the tiles that were already in there so for example if i move this tile map people you can see it has the same tiles now i want this one to have the objects that are going to be placed on top of the background so just erase all these in order to select on which tile map you are actually painting on you have in here the drop down menu for the active tile map so in this case i want to erase this one on the over tile map so just select that one and now if i click yeah there you go now i'm erasing this one and by the way if you select on control then you can have a bigger brush area so just select control select the whole thing and now i can erase everything with just one click all right so the overtime map is now empty and just reset it back on zero zero so everything is nicely positioned okay now we want to place some things on this time map that will show up on top of the previous one so on each tile map you can see the tilemap printer and in here you have the sorting layer as well as the sorting order so in this case let's leave the base one on default at zero and this one is meant to be on top so just put it on 10. so now if i place down some objects so let's say i want to print this little tree trunk and if there you go gets placed in there so now i want to place some of these and there you go i can place them so we now have one tama being painted on top of another one however we want this one to be in between the other tones so i want to place the sprite in between those two edges now to do that there is essentially two approaches so we can just move the timelapse object so just move it by 0.5 and 0.5 and there you go now it's offset on each corner and another potential approach is to modify over here the tile anchor so at 0.5 they are being anchored in the center and if i put at 0 0 then they're now at the bottom yep just like that so you have those two options in this case let's leave the anchor at that and just slightly offset the tile map object okay so now i can place the sprite in between the edges just like that i can also place a bunch of other objects so there you go a couple of bushes a couple of tree trunks and so on now another thing you can do is modify the tile palette so over here you have a button for edit so click on it and now we are in edit mode so while in edit mode select the paint brush then control click on the one that we want to copy so control click and then let's make four of them in here then also control click on this one and make another one there all right so now with the select tool select this one and now rotate this one by 90 degrees and this one by 180 and this one by 270. all right so we have all these rotated ones and for this one rotate by 90. all right so there it is save the tile palette exit edit mode and now we have all these nice rotated sprites so if i want i can now perfectly place these ones see if there you go just like that by the way another thing you can do is also play around with the pivot for each object so for example on the tree trunk you can go into the texture go into the sprite editor here is the tree trunk and instead of having the pivot down middle let's move it down in there and hit apply and there you go they all moved automatically so you can modify the pivot of where the thing gets placed and lastly you also have options for scaling the tiles so with the select tool select each tile and then for example modify the scale 222 and now if i try to paint this there you go now it paints it much bigger so you can really play around with any object on the palette now with regards to scaling for example i have these four objects which are meant to be smaller than one grid position so if i try to place the pillar right here that's a bit bigger i don't want it to be that big so again i can click here in order to modify the scale put it that much smaller and now if i try to paint it yep there you go it is much smaller so this works but this really only scales the sprites so the grid size is still the same so i cannot put them right next to each other so another approach is to make a brand new grid and set the cell size to be smart so right click create the brand new tile map which creates a new grid as well as new tile map so let's rename this to the town map details and on the grid itself over here we can modify the cell size so let's say 0.5 so we have this main grid and then we have this smaller grid and now in here with this active tile map selected i can place down these objects right like this all right so here's our world map composed of a background then some objects on top and then some smaller details now just one last thing regarding time maps which is adding colliders so for example i want these objects to be fully solid for that i'm just going to duplicate this time map and name this the town map colliders and then all we need to do is add the component of the tile map collider so just do that and yep it adds letters to all the objects so on this one just erase all the ones that are not the pillars so just in here erase and get rid of all those all right so i erased all the objects except for the pillars and now the character controller is already testing for collisions so if i play so here's my character and i can walk around normally and if i go towards the pillars no can do it can't go through them so that's how simple it is to add collisions onto your tile map and this also shows how easy it is to use the tile map when making a platformer game so you could draw the world using the town map and then just add the time map collector and all of a sudden you have platform collisions alright so now you know how to use the builtin unity tama it's a very versatile tool that you can use to build massive worlds very easily and if you want to see how you could make a custom town map from scratch go watch that other video that one is based on the grid class made previously which is very versatile and you can make it perfectly fit your needs but for simple cases the builtin unity time map is excellent and very easy to use now like i said the sprite sheet i'm using here is from the complete visual scripting course that i'm currently working on one of the games is an action rpg where i will use the tile map in order to build the world
