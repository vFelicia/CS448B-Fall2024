00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and now that we're in 2021
00:03 - let's take a look at some of the best
00:05 - unity videos of 2020.
00:07 - there were a total of 115 videos
00:10 - published covering all sorts of topics
00:12 - everything from simple tutorials to
00:14 - machine learning effects game
00:16 - analysis complete courses and much much
00:17 - more
00:18 - i made a really nice page with the more
00:20 - interesting videos grouped into a bunch
00:22 - of categories
00:22 - check that out if you want to browse
00:24 - these videos in your own time there's
00:26 - too many awesome ones for me to mention
00:27 - in just this video
00:29 - the year actually started off quite well
00:31 - back in january the channel hit 100 000
00:33 - subscribers
00:34 - so thank you all for that and i really
00:36 - hope you've learned a ton from all of
00:38 - these videos
00:38 - then a video that took a massive amount
00:40 - of work to make my game dev journey
00:43 - in there i talk about how i started
00:44 - programming 20 years ago making irc
00:46 - scripts
00:47 - then i moved on to flash and finally to
00:49 - unity i'm really happy with that video
00:51 - it's a really nice summary of all the
00:53 - projects that i've done in all that time
00:55 - it was a total of over 40 games and it
00:58 - should also serve as an inspiration to
00:59 - you to take your own time on your own
01:01 - journey and just focus on getting better
01:03 - day by day
01:04 - then when the whole thing of 2020
01:06 - started i made a video on my tips from
01:08 - working from home
01:09 - i've been working from home for many
01:11 - many years now so if you're just
01:12 - starting hopefully my tips can help you
01:15 - then for a really interesting complete
01:16 - game named wash your hands
01:18 - this was obviously very topical at the
01:21 - time and it was also the very first time
01:22 - that i experimented making a 3d video i
01:26 - mainly stick with 2d since making
01:27 - textures is easier than 3d
01:29 - meshes but i had some asset packs laying
01:31 - around so that's what i used
01:33 - it's an interesting minigame you go
01:35 - around clearing up all the nasty
01:37 - particles while telling people to wash
01:38 - their hands
01:39 - and visually i'm quite pleased with the
01:41 - end result some really good looking 3d
01:43 - world with some flat sprites and
01:45 - lots and lots of effects i made a bunch
01:47 - more complete games
01:48 - one of them was i made doom in unity it
01:51 - was great to remake one of the old time
01:53 - classics and make it work exactly like
01:55 - the original
01:56 - another one was a simple match 3 game i
01:59 - needed this for a video that i was
02:00 - planning so i made it from scratch in
02:02 - just under 6 hours and recorded the
02:04 - whole thing
02:05 - and i also participated in the mixing
02:07 - game jam where i made a really
02:08 - interesting racing rts
02:10 - in just 48 hours as the name implies
02:12 - it's a mix of racing and rts where you
02:14 - drive around the car and also control a
02:16 - bunch of other car units
02:17 - it's a very unique design speaking of
02:20 - complete games
02:20 - this year was also when i launched the
02:22 - code monkey steam app
02:24 - i've been thinking about doing something
02:26 - like this for ages and finally i managed
02:28 - to do it
02:28 - i wanted something to group all the
02:30 - videos and all the games that i've made
02:32 - into one nice complete package and
02:33 - that's exactly what it is
02:35 - it's completely free so we'll go ahead
02:37 - pick it up on steam it includes all of
02:39 - the various games that i've made on the
02:40 - channel
02:41 - like the wash your hands game that i
02:42 - just mentioned so you can easily get the
02:44 - app and play through all those games
02:46 - it also has some really interesting
02:48 - interactive tutorials
02:50 - it's a nice minigame that teaches you c
02:52 - sharp and unity as well as game design
02:54 - also looks really good with some nice
02:56 - assets and on the app there's also a
02:58 - section for my own steam games and more
03:00 - importantly they have a list of the
03:02 - various tutorial videos that i've made
03:04 - where i remade some of those elements so
03:06 - for example you can go and play my steam
03:08 - games and then go watch those videos to
03:10 - see how those systems were made
03:12 - really interesting stuff as for unit
03:14 - tools and features i also covered a
03:16 - bunch of them
03:17 - i made a simple video on unt analytics
03:20 - definitely something you should use when
03:21 - making your own games
03:22 - another one on game simulation which is
03:24 - a very interesting tool that lets you
03:26 - run your game
03:27 - tons and tons of times on the cloud in
03:29 - parallel
03:30 - it's very useful for testing your game
03:32 - thousands of times and coming up with
03:33 - the perfect balance levels
03:35 - i also made a video on the visual effect
03:37 - graph this is how you can exploit the
03:39 - power of the gpu to render millions and
03:40 - millions of particles
03:42 - i did a general overview and then a nice
03:44 - scatter effect and finally near the end
03:47 - of the year i got into machine learning
03:48 - using unity ml agents
03:50 - this is a fascinating toolkit that is
03:52 - actually very easy to use and gives you
03:54 - the full power of machine learning
03:56 - i cover the basics of machine learning
03:58 - then how to use imitation learning
04:00 - and how to teach in ai how to play
04:02 - flappy bird and drive a car
04:04 - machine learning has a massive amount of
04:06 - potential so definitely and look forward
04:07 - to some more videos on how you can use
04:09 - this tool to help you make better games
04:12 - back in march i made a ton of dots
04:14 - videos
04:16 - covering physics lists prefabs events
04:18 - and subscenes
04:19 - i implemented pathfinding in dots and i
04:21 - even made an awesome video on how you
04:23 - can combine super fast dots pathfinding
04:25 - with normal game objects
04:27 - that was really awesome and insanely
04:29 - fast so back then i covered lots of
04:31 - topics and i even made a complete game
04:33 - internally using dots
04:34 - just to showcase how it was already very
04:36 - capable at the time
04:37 - i haven't been back to using dots since
04:39 - then but based on how good it was
04:41 - already a year ago i can't wait to try
04:43 - it again
04:43 - i also experimented with a different
04:45 - type of video watching some popular
04:47 - aaa games and analyzing their trailers
04:49 - to see how all of those mechanics are
04:51 - made
04:52 - start off with the very first video
04:53 - analyzing the watch dogs trailer looking
04:56 - at all the mechanics shown in the
04:57 - trailer and teaching you how you could
04:59 - build them in your own games
05:01 - then i analyzed the spiderman trailer
05:03 - which is full of solid mechanics to
05:04 - learn from
05:05 - and then ghost of tsushima which really
05:07 - has some interesting sound mechanics
05:09 - visual effects and a hook shot this is
05:11 - an interesting format that i definitely
05:13 - want to keep doing
05:14 - the only issue with this is that it
05:16 - requires me to find some good gameplay
05:18 - trailer that showcases a bunch of things
05:20 - usually those trailers come out at e3
05:22 - and since there was no e3 last year that
05:24 - kind of limits things
05:25 - but there's lots of awesome ones from
05:27 - previous years so i'll probably be
05:28 - looking at those
05:29 - game design is really a timeless
05:31 - discipline so you can learn just as much
05:33 - from older titles as well as from new
05:35 - ones
05:35 - and in december when cyberpunk launched
05:37 - i did another similar experiment
05:39 - except instead of watching the trailer i
05:41 - played through the game and selected a
05:43 - bunch of mechanics to then go remake in
05:45 - unity
05:46 - this format has the benefit that i don't
05:47 - need to find the perfect official
05:49 - gameplay trailer i can just play the
05:50 - game myself
05:52 - the goal with this was to show you how
05:53 - these aaa games look impossibly complex
05:56 - but many of the things they do you can
05:57 - definitely do them for yourself in unity
05:59 - and remaking those mechanics was a lot
06:01 - of fun so this is also a format that i
06:03 - intend to keep doing
06:04 - as for tutorials there were obviously
06:06 - tons of them one of the main reasons why
06:08 - i started this channel was to share my
06:10 - knowledge with all of you and also
06:11 - because i wanted to explore tons of
06:13 - different topics and continue on my own
06:15 - learning journey
06:16 - so with that one really awesome
06:17 - mini-series was on a crafting system
06:20 - back in 2019 i made an inventory system
06:22 - and then in 2020 i made a minecraft like
06:25 - crafting system built on top of it
06:27 - it works exactly as you expect drag the
06:29 - recipe in the correct position and drag
06:30 - the output item
06:31 - later i made a video on scriptable
06:33 - objects this is how you can define a
06:35 - data structure to create individual
06:37 - objects to hold some data
06:38 - i also made a video on custom inspectors
06:40 - with custom fields
06:42 - images buttons and so on and finally i
06:44 - combined everything and made the
06:46 - crafting system with scriptable objects
06:47 - and a custom editor
06:49 - it's super easy and very visual to
06:51 - create a completely brand new item and
06:53 - define a brand new recipe for how to
06:55 - make it
06:56 - i'm really happy with the final result
06:58 - on this one definitely need to use it
06:59 - more often in some more videos
07:01 - i made a shadowgraph overview video just
07:03 - teaching the basics for how it works
07:05 - and then some tutorial videos on
07:06 - interesting effects one of them
07:08 - on a simple grassland shader it makes
07:11 - the sprite deform in such a way that it
07:12 - looks like wind
07:14 - and another one for a really awesome
07:15 - building construction effect
07:17 - i really need an effect like this for my
07:19 - course and this is what i came up with
07:21 - i really like how it looks it seems as
07:23 - if the building is being printed
07:24 - line by line really cool also related to
07:27 - shadowgraph i made a video on how to use
07:29 - the shadow graph to make custom pose
07:31 - processing effects
07:32 - so every effect that i've already
07:33 - covered like for example the solve can
07:35 - be applied to tone on screen
07:37 - one really interesting video was on
07:38 - converting 2d into 3d and vice versa
07:41 - i've made a lot of videos using 2ds demo
07:44 - because it's simply easier for me to
07:46 - draw sprites than make meshes but for
07:48 - the most part
07:48 - all of my videos work both in 2d and 3d
07:52 - but i do see that comment a lot going
07:54 - into something like the inventory system
07:56 - video and asking if it works in 3d
07:58 - so i made this video to showcase how
08:00 - easy it is to convert systems between 2d
08:02 - and 3d
08:03 - it's usually very very easy there were a
08:06 - bunch of videos regarding enemies
08:08 - starting off with a simple ai just
08:10 - teaching how to use a basic state
08:12 - machine to make some sort of basic enemy
08:14 - logic
08:15 - then a battle system for spawning
08:16 - enemies when the player gets near
08:18 - or triggers some sort of condition i
08:20 - made a really awesome boss fight
08:22 - again using a state machine to define an
08:24 - interesting boss battle with various
08:26 - stages
08:27 - also made a melee combat system that
08:29 - features smart targeting so it knows
08:31 - which target it should prioritize
08:33 - and the video covering several methods
08:35 - for how to find targets
08:36 - pick the one that best suits your needs
08:38 - also related was the video on various
08:40 - methods for shooting projectiles
08:42 - all of them with pros and cons it all
08:44 - depends on what projectile you're trying
08:46 - to simulate
08:47 - then i made two player controllers one
08:49 - of them very standard just a normal
08:51 - top-down player controller
08:52 - you can move around that has physics and
08:54 - collisions and so on it even features an
08:56 - instant dash and nice nodule
08:58 - this is the standard controller that i
09:00 - use in most of my top-down videos
09:02 - and another really interesting one based
09:04 - on a modular design
09:06 - so the whole thing is based on building
09:07 - several modules that then work on top of
09:09 - each other
09:10 - you can use a module that just has some
09:12 - dumb movement or easily swap it out for
09:14 - one that uses pathfinding
09:16 - use one for player control or swap it
09:18 - out for one with enemy ai
09:19 - it's a really interesting design and by
09:21 - going through it you will learn a ton of
09:23 - things like using c-sharp interface
09:25 - for some more ai i also made a simple
09:27 - tower defense ai
09:29 - place down towers and have them target
09:30 - enemies then a video on a simple rts
09:33 - control system
09:34 - i definitely would like to make some
09:35 - more rts videos as soon as i have the
09:37 - time
09:38 - and if you're a fan of games like xcom i
09:40 - made an awesome grid combat system
09:43 - its turn base features two different
09:45 - teams and it's based on a grid
09:46 - it's a great starting point for any
09:48 - strategy game i made a video on using
09:50 - several methods of interacting with
09:52 - objects
09:53 - using a button position item and so on i
09:56 - show it being used on a door but really
09:57 - they can be used for any object
09:59 - then for some more general videos i made
10:02 - one on the math behind splines and how
10:04 - you can make some really awesome smooth
10:06 - shapes
10:06 - you can then use them to move a car
10:08 - around or make some roads or really just
10:10 - any smooth curve
10:11 - somewhat related to that is the video on
10:13 - animation curves and how you can use
10:15 - them for so much more than just
10:17 - animation
10:18 - one video on a simple chat bubble this
10:20 - is the example like i used in my game
10:22 - battleground tycoon
10:23 - a really great video on animated cursors
10:26 - so this one is exactly what i use
10:27 - in my survivor squad games and i also
10:30 - made a tone tip that works perfectly
10:32 - always
10:32 - is on screen and follows the mouse then
10:34 - a video on how to make unity as a
10:36 - transparent window
10:37 - this was a lot of fun to research you
10:39 - can essentially do anything you can with
10:41 - unity and use it as an overlay on top of
10:43 - your desktop
10:44 - one example was i made a simple
10:46 - assistant like the ones that existed
10:48 - back in the 90s
10:49 - this is also how i made the annotation
10:51 - program that i then used in the game dev
10:53 - reacts videos
10:54 - and another interesting one was in
10:56 - making a launcher
10:57 - you make a unity program that then
10:59 - launches other programs
11:01 - so this one is pretty much exactly how
11:02 - my cmap works it's a hub for all the
11:05 - other projects that i've made
11:06 - there were a bunch of c sharp focused
11:08 - videos first of all
11:10 - very quick video showcasing c sharp
11:12 - basics in just 10 minutes
11:13 - it gives you a great overview of the
11:15 - language then some videos going in-depth
11:17 - on various c-sharp topics
11:19 - one on the basics of loops the various
11:21 - types you have and how each differ from
11:23 - each other
11:24 - a video on events and how they help you
11:26 - keep your code clean and nicely
11:28 - decoupled
11:29 - also a video on delegates which lets you
11:31 - store a function inside a field
11:33 - very useful one covering interfaces
11:36 - which lets you define
11:37 - certain behavior on your types like for
11:39 - example having an interface for every
11:41 - object that can be
11:42 - damaged and one on generics which are
11:44 - insanely useful
11:45 - then let you write code that works with
11:47 - any class so this is extensively used in
11:50 - my grid class
11:52 - and finally i made a super useful video
11:54 - on my process for solving the very
11:55 - common error of null reference
11:57 - exceptions
11:58 - in there i mentioned my step-by-step
12:00 - process for how i always solve that
12:01 - error
12:02 - if you go through all those videos you
12:04 - will certainly learn a ton about c-sharp
12:05 - and program
12:06 - and as i've already mentioned i made
12:08 - tons of dots videos and machine learning
12:10 - tutorials
12:11 - so yep in 2020 there were tons of topics
12:14 - covered this year
12:15 - everything from simple to complex some
12:17 - based on programming
12:18 - others based on rendering others on game
12:20 - design and various unity tools
12:22 - i'd definitely love to hear from you
12:24 - which ones you found most useful
12:26 - this year was also when i finally
12:27 - decided to try making some complete
12:29 - courses
12:30 - i've wanted for a long time to do some
12:32 - complete courses essentially they allow
12:33 - me to cover a lot more and speak about a
12:35 - lot more things that i just can't fit in
12:37 - a 20 minute video
12:39 - so with that in mind i first made the
12:40 - bundler defender course
12:42 - i'm really happy with the final result
12:44 - you can definitely learn a ton which is
12:45 - applicable to a lot of genres like city
12:47 - builders tower defense survival games
12:49 - and so on
12:50 - the course starts completely from
12:52 - scratch the very first video is on
12:53 - creating a brand new empty project
12:55 - and it goes step by step until the final
12:58 - completed game
12:59 - it's around 20 hours so i can definitely
13:01 - go into a lot more depth than in my
13:02 - normal videos
13:03 - all of the lectures have their own
13:05 - project files as downloadable resources
13:07 - so you can start from the beginning or
13:08 - pick up from anywhere you want
13:10 - this was my first course essentially
13:12 - showcasing making a game
13:13 - exactly the way that i make my own games
13:15 - using code
13:16 - but then i also made another massive
13:18 - course this one all about making games
13:20 - internally using visual scripting
13:22 - i specifically designed the course to
13:23 - include not one but three games
13:25 - in order to cover lots of different
13:27 - genres this was an interesting challenge
13:29 - and it definitely showed me how it is
13:31 - absolutely possible to build anything
13:33 - you want using solely visual scripting
13:35 - the action rpg and the fps are some
13:37 - pretty complex games and they all work
13:39 - perfectly without a single line of code
13:41 - and just like the builder defender
13:42 - course this one also starts completely
13:44 - from scratch and contains all the
13:46 - downloadable project files for
13:48 - all the unlectures so all in all i'm
13:50 - really happy with those two courses and
13:51 - based on the reviews it seems that
13:53 - people like them as well
13:54 - i definitely want to do some more
13:55 - although they do take a massive amount
13:57 - of time so it won't be a while before
13:59 - the next one
13:59 - speaking of courses i also made an
14:01 - interesting video comparing the pros and
14:03 - cons of free tutorials versus paid
14:05 - courses
14:05 - in there i talk about the various
14:07 - differences and how courses are better
14:09 - for
14:09 - learning all the tiny things that no one
14:11 - mentions in a normal tutorial
14:13 - and i also talk about how tutorials are
14:15 - excellent if you already know what
14:16 - you're looking for
14:17 - it's a really great video and i'd
14:19 - encourage you to check it out if you
14:20 - haven't already there's tons of benefits
14:22 - to both types if you know how to use
14:24 - them
14:24 - alright so that was the year 2020. tons
14:27 - of awesome stuff with 115 videos in
14:29 - total
14:30 - check the page on the website which
14:32 - contains links to all of these videos
14:33 - and a bunch more
14:34 - there might be some there that you may
14:36 - not have seen and you might find quite
14:37 - useful
14:38 - i'd love to hear from you which ones you
14:40 - found the most useful
14:41 - thank you all for continuing to watch
14:43 - the videos i really hope you've learned
14:44 - a ton from them and i hope to continue
14:46 - making content that you find
14:48 - educational and entertaining this video
14:50 - is made possible thanks to these awesome
14:52 - supporters
14:53 - go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get
14:55 - some perks and help keep the videos free
14:57 - for everyone
14:58 - so again thank you all so much for
15:00 - watching and i'll see you next time

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and now that we're in 2021 let's take a look at some of the best unity videos of 2020. there were a total of 115 videos published covering all sorts of topics everything from simple tutorials to machine learning effects game analysis complete courses and much much more i made a really nice page with the more interesting videos grouped into a bunch of categories check that out if you want to browse these videos in your own time there's too many awesome ones for me to mention in just this video the year actually started off quite well back in january the channel hit 100 000 subscribers so thank you all for that and i really hope you've learned a ton from all of these videos then a video that took a massive amount of work to make my game dev journey in there i talk about how i started programming 20 years ago making irc scripts then i moved on to flash and finally to unity i'm really happy with that video it's a really nice summary of all the projects that i've done in all that time it was a total of over 40 games and it should also serve as an inspiration to you to take your own time on your own journey and just focus on getting better day by day then when the whole thing of 2020 started i made a video on my tips from working from home i've been working from home for many many years now so if you're just starting hopefully my tips can help you then for a really interesting complete game named wash your hands this was obviously very topical at the time and it was also the very first time that i experimented making a 3d video i mainly stick with 2d since making textures is easier than 3d meshes but i had some asset packs laying around so that's what i used it's an interesting minigame you go around clearing up all the nasty particles while telling people to wash their hands and visually i'm quite pleased with the end result some really good looking 3d world with some flat sprites and lots and lots of effects i made a bunch more complete games one of them was i made doom in unity it was great to remake one of the old time classics and make it work exactly like the original another one was a simple match 3 game i needed this for a video that i was planning so i made it from scratch in just under 6 hours and recorded the whole thing and i also participated in the mixing game jam where i made a really interesting racing rts in just 48 hours as the name implies it's a mix of racing and rts where you drive around the car and also control a bunch of other car units it's a very unique design speaking of complete games this year was also when i launched the code monkey steam app i've been thinking about doing something like this for ages and finally i managed to do it i wanted something to group all the videos and all the games that i've made into one nice complete package and that's exactly what it is it's completely free so we'll go ahead pick it up on steam it includes all of the various games that i've made on the channel like the wash your hands game that i just mentioned so you can easily get the app and play through all those games it also has some really interesting interactive tutorials it's a nice minigame that teaches you c sharp and unity as well as game design also looks really good with some nice assets and on the app there's also a section for my own steam games and more importantly they have a list of the various tutorial videos that i've made where i remade some of those elements so for example you can go and play my steam games and then go watch those videos to see how those systems were made really interesting stuff as for unit tools and features i also covered a bunch of them i made a simple video on unt analytics definitely something you should use when making your own games another one on game simulation which is a very interesting tool that lets you run your game tons and tons of times on the cloud in parallel it's very useful for testing your game thousands of times and coming up with the perfect balance levels i also made a video on the visual effect graph this is how you can exploit the power of the gpu to render millions and millions of particles i did a general overview and then a nice scatter effect and finally near the end of the year i got into machine learning using unity ml agents this is a fascinating toolkit that is actually very easy to use and gives you the full power of machine learning i cover the basics of machine learning then how to use imitation learning and how to teach in ai how to play flappy bird and drive a car machine learning has a massive amount of potential so definitely and look forward to some more videos on how you can use this tool to help you make better games back in march i made a ton of dots videos covering physics lists prefabs events and subscenes i implemented pathfinding in dots and i even made an awesome video on how you can combine super fast dots pathfinding with normal game objects that was really awesome and insanely fast so back then i covered lots of topics and i even made a complete game internally using dots just to showcase how it was already very capable at the time i haven't been back to using dots since then but based on how good it was already a year ago i can't wait to try it again i also experimented with a different type of video watching some popular aaa games and analyzing their trailers to see how all of those mechanics are made start off with the very first video analyzing the watch dogs trailer looking at all the mechanics shown in the trailer and teaching you how you could build them in your own games then i analyzed the spiderman trailer which is full of solid mechanics to learn from and then ghost of tsushima which really has some interesting sound mechanics visual effects and a hook shot this is an interesting format that i definitely want to keep doing the only issue with this is that it requires me to find some good gameplay trailer that showcases a bunch of things usually those trailers come out at e3 and since there was no e3 last year that kind of limits things but there's lots of awesome ones from previous years so i'll probably be looking at those game design is really a timeless discipline so you can learn just as much from older titles as well as from new ones and in december when cyberpunk launched i did another similar experiment except instead of watching the trailer i played through the game and selected a bunch of mechanics to then go remake in unity this format has the benefit that i don't need to find the perfect official gameplay trailer i can just play the game myself the goal with this was to show you how these aaa games look impossibly complex but many of the things they do you can definitely do them for yourself in unity and remaking those mechanics was a lot of fun so this is also a format that i intend to keep doing as for tutorials there were obviously tons of them one of the main reasons why i started this channel was to share my knowledge with all of you and also because i wanted to explore tons of different topics and continue on my own learning journey so with that one really awesome miniseries was on a crafting system back in 2019 i made an inventory system and then in 2020 i made a minecraft like crafting system built on top of it it works exactly as you expect drag the recipe in the correct position and drag the output item later i made a video on scriptable objects this is how you can define a data structure to create individual objects to hold some data i also made a video on custom inspectors with custom fields images buttons and so on and finally i combined everything and made the crafting system with scriptable objects and a custom editor it's super easy and very visual to create a completely brand new item and define a brand new recipe for how to make it i'm really happy with the final result on this one definitely need to use it more often in some more videos i made a shadowgraph overview video just teaching the basics for how it works and then some tutorial videos on interesting effects one of them on a simple grassland shader it makes the sprite deform in such a way that it looks like wind and another one for a really awesome building construction effect i really need an effect like this for my course and this is what i came up with i really like how it looks it seems as if the building is being printed line by line really cool also related to shadowgraph i made a video on how to use the shadow graph to make custom pose processing effects so every effect that i've already covered like for example the solve can be applied to tone on screen one really interesting video was on converting 2d into 3d and vice versa i've made a lot of videos using 2ds demo because it's simply easier for me to draw sprites than make meshes but for the most part all of my videos work both in 2d and 3d but i do see that comment a lot going into something like the inventory system video and asking if it works in 3d so i made this video to showcase how easy it is to convert systems between 2d and 3d it's usually very very easy there were a bunch of videos regarding enemies starting off with a simple ai just teaching how to use a basic state machine to make some sort of basic enemy logic then a battle system for spawning enemies when the player gets near or triggers some sort of condition i made a really awesome boss fight again using a state machine to define an interesting boss battle with various stages also made a melee combat system that features smart targeting so it knows which target it should prioritize and the video covering several methods for how to find targets pick the one that best suits your needs also related was the video on various methods for shooting projectiles all of them with pros and cons it all depends on what projectile you're trying to simulate then i made two player controllers one of them very standard just a normal topdown player controller you can move around that has physics and collisions and so on it even features an instant dash and nice nodule this is the standard controller that i use in most of my topdown videos and another really interesting one based on a modular design so the whole thing is based on building several modules that then work on top of each other you can use a module that just has some dumb movement or easily swap it out for one that uses pathfinding use one for player control or swap it out for one with enemy ai it's a really interesting design and by going through it you will learn a ton of things like using csharp interface for some more ai i also made a simple tower defense ai place down towers and have them target enemies then a video on a simple rts control system i definitely would like to make some more rts videos as soon as i have the time and if you're a fan of games like xcom i made an awesome grid combat system its turn base features two different teams and it's based on a grid it's a great starting point for any strategy game i made a video on using several methods of interacting with objects using a button position item and so on i show it being used on a door but really they can be used for any object then for some more general videos i made one on the math behind splines and how you can make some really awesome smooth shapes you can then use them to move a car around or make some roads or really just any smooth curve somewhat related to that is the video on animation curves and how you can use them for so much more than just animation one video on a simple chat bubble this is the example like i used in my game battleground tycoon a really great video on animated cursors so this one is exactly what i use in my survivor squad games and i also made a tone tip that works perfectly always is on screen and follows the mouse then a video on how to make unity as a transparent window this was a lot of fun to research you can essentially do anything you can with unity and use it as an overlay on top of your desktop one example was i made a simple assistant like the ones that existed back in the 90s this is also how i made the annotation program that i then used in the game dev reacts videos and another interesting one was in making a launcher you make a unity program that then launches other programs so this one is pretty much exactly how my cmap works it's a hub for all the other projects that i've made there were a bunch of c sharp focused videos first of all very quick video showcasing c sharp basics in just 10 minutes it gives you a great overview of the language then some videos going indepth on various csharp topics one on the basics of loops the various types you have and how each differ from each other a video on events and how they help you keep your code clean and nicely decoupled also a video on delegates which lets you store a function inside a field very useful one covering interfaces which lets you define certain behavior on your types like for example having an interface for every object that can be damaged and one on generics which are insanely useful then let you write code that works with any class so this is extensively used in my grid class and finally i made a super useful video on my process for solving the very common error of null reference exceptions in there i mentioned my stepbystep process for how i always solve that error if you go through all those videos you will certainly learn a ton about csharp and program and as i've already mentioned i made tons of dots videos and machine learning tutorials so yep in 2020 there were tons of topics covered this year everything from simple to complex some based on programming others based on rendering others on game design and various unity tools i'd definitely love to hear from you which ones you found most useful this year was also when i finally decided to try making some complete courses i've wanted for a long time to do some complete courses essentially they allow me to cover a lot more and speak about a lot more things that i just can't fit in a 20 minute video so with that in mind i first made the bundler defender course i'm really happy with the final result you can definitely learn a ton which is applicable to a lot of genres like city builders tower defense survival games and so on the course starts completely from scratch the very first video is on creating a brand new empty project and it goes step by step until the final completed game it's around 20 hours so i can definitely go into a lot more depth than in my normal videos all of the lectures have their own project files as downloadable resources so you can start from the beginning or pick up from anywhere you want this was my first course essentially showcasing making a game exactly the way that i make my own games using code but then i also made another massive course this one all about making games internally using visual scripting i specifically designed the course to include not one but three games in order to cover lots of different genres this was an interesting challenge and it definitely showed me how it is absolutely possible to build anything you want using solely visual scripting the action rpg and the fps are some pretty complex games and they all work perfectly without a single line of code and just like the builder defender course this one also starts completely from scratch and contains all the downloadable project files for all the unlectures so all in all i'm really happy with those two courses and based on the reviews it seems that people like them as well i definitely want to do some more although they do take a massive amount of time so it won't be a while before the next one speaking of courses i also made an interesting video comparing the pros and cons of free tutorials versus paid courses in there i talk about the various differences and how courses are better for learning all the tiny things that no one mentions in a normal tutorial and i also talk about how tutorials are excellent if you already know what you're looking for it's a really great video and i'd encourage you to check it out if you haven't already there's tons of benefits to both types if you know how to use them alright so that was the year 2020. tons of awesome stuff with 115 videos in total check the page on the website which contains links to all of these videos and a bunch more there might be some there that you may not have seen and you might find quite useful i'd love to hear from you which ones you found the most useful thank you all for continuing to watch the videos i really hope you've learned a ton from them and i hope to continue making content that you find educational and entertaining this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone so again thank you all so much for watching and i'll see you next time
