00:43 - lecture on the localization package this
00:45 - is a really awesome Unity tool to help
00:47 - you localize your games which is
00:48 - something that see themselves highly
00:50 - recommends that you do it's one of the
00:51 - things that massively increase your

00:54 - algorithm thankfully the tool is super
00:56 - easy to use so you should definitely
00:57 - include it in your games then there's a
00:59 - lecture on the decal projector this is
01:01 - something that a lot of people don't
01:03 - really know that exists it's how you can
01:05 - project a Sprite onto any geometry in
01:07 - the world this is not just a flat quad
01:09 - it is actually projected onto the world
01:11 - so it's perfect for things like blood
01:12 - splatter things like bullet holes
01:14 - graffiti or even some coins on the floor
01:16 - or even just some dirt to populate your
01:18 - levels then there's a lecture on cloud
01:21 - Diagnostics this is pretty much a must
01:23 - have tool you absolutely must enable
01:25 - this in your games it enables you to see
01:27 - on the dashboard what kind of bugs your
01:29 - players are encountering without having
01:31 - to rely on manual reports so this is
01:33 - super useful for helping make your game
01:35 - as bug free as possible and related to
01:37 - that the next lecture is on the user
01:39 - reporting tool this one is meant for
01:41 - manual player reports you can include a
01:44 - screenshot and all kinds of data like a
01:46 - save file to really help you track down
01:48 - issues and fix them then there's the
01:49 - lecture on the textmesh pro fallback
01:51 - feature this is another thing many
01:53 - people don't know about it's how you can

01:57 - font if the current one does not have a
01:59 - glyph for a certain character and
02:01 - finally a lecture on the frame debugger
02:03 - this is a really useful tool for helping
