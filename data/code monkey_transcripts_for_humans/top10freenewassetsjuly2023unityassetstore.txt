00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for July
00:09 - 23 in this first video I'll be covering
00:11 - a list of free assets and next ones I'll
00:13 - be covering paint ads and tools let me
00:15 - know in the comments if you pick up any
00:16 - of these and what you intend to do with
00:17 - them also right now there's a mega
00:19 - bundle on the acid store it's got 30
00:21 - assets for 30 bucks on the first year
00:23 - you've got some nice animations some
00:25 - pixel monsters you've got a bunch of
00:26 - sound effects there's some nice modular
00:28 - pixel characters then down into the
00:31 - second tier if you had a nice nature
00:33 - pack made by cinti a and localization
00:35 - tool a bad word on filter a really nice
00:37 - book flipping Shader and a ton of assets
00:39 - for making a nice low poly mining cave
00:41 - and last year this one has a 97 off
00:43 - discount so if just one of these looks
00:45 - interesting then you can go ahead and
00:46 - get it there's only four days left so if
00:48 - you're interested definitely get it
00:49 - quickly alright so on to the top 10 list
00:51 - starting off with a nice animation pack
00:53 - with a bunch of tonking interacting
00:55 - animations usually there aren't that
00:57 - many free animation packs and this one
00:59 - looks quite unique it features 16
01:01 - animations so things like happy crying
01:03 - laughing it's got some Applause angry
01:06 - hungry so I could see this being great
01:07 - for some kind of party game or maybe
01:09 - something likes my party then for a nice
01:11 - and simple tool here is one for sorting
01:13 - your hiking this one is definitely a
01:15 - problem when the hierarchy has tons and
01:17 - tons of objects storing them can be a
01:19 - nice way to keep things organized you
01:21 - can sort everything sort by alphabetical
01:23 - or reverse sort by name or by position
01:26 - you can select which specific ones to
01:28 - sort or really just sort all children
01:29 - it's a nice and simple tool that does
01:31 - just one thing and does it very well
01:33 - then for some nice assets here is a
01:35 - Japanese bar it looks really nice and
01:37 - cozy it includes the bar some decoration
01:39 - a bunch of sushi and sake props it even
01:42 - has some playing cards some water
01:43 - buckets money and a nice cash register
01:46 - only on pretty unique pack then for
01:48 - another tool here is one called go now
01:50 - goat means going oriented action planner
01:52 - so it's a way of handling AI it looks
01:54 - surprisingly great for a free asset if
01:57 - you'd like to experiment with this kind
01:58 - of AI then this looks like you really
02:00 - great tool you define your goals and
02:01 - your actions define them either with
02:03 - config files or with code then you can
02:05 - visualize all the units and what
02:07 - decisions they are making it use the job
02:08 - system so it's super performant and has
02:10 - some really detailed documentation very
02:12 - interesting then if you have UI objects
02:14 - that you'd like to animate here is it
02:16 - you want to help you do that basically
02:17 - you can use this Shader and then this
02:19 - tool to easily modify any of the
02:21 - properties on that material there is no
02:23 - need to create tons of materials for
02:25 - every single individual change you can
02:27 - apply an override to just that one
02:28 - object you can modify the scale color
02:30 - rotation offset and all of these
02:32 - overrides can also be animated which
02:34 - gives you a ton of control over your UI
02:36 - definitely very useful to make UI
02:37 - animations much much simpler next for
02:40 - some assets here is a pack with a bunch
02:42 - of low poly rocks it's got a nice
02:44 - variety of sounds so you've got snow
02:45 - grass desert and rock there's also a
02:48 - nice variety of shapes there's some
02:50 - really big ones and some tiny Pebbles
02:51 - it's always great to have one of these
02:53 - packs to populate your world then if you
02:55 - want to organize objects in 3D space
02:57 - here is a nice thing to do that I'm
02:59 - pretty sure I've seen the paid version
03:00 - of this tune before it looks really
03:02 - useful for quickly organizing objects
03:04 - I'm not entirely sure what are the
03:05 - limitations of this free version you
03:07 - have full control over where the objects
03:09 - are positioned you can define a shape
03:10 - size margin and padding you can animate
03:13 - the objects as they are positioned
03:14 - animate them using a curve or a simple
03:16 - lerb or rigid body or any custom
03:18 - animation it automatically works with
03:20 - meshes Sprites texts colliders and even
03:22 - UI objects next if you're working on a
03:24 - medieval game and need some props here
03:26 - is a nice pack it's got some fences some
03:28 - four boards crates benches and various
03:31 - items so a nice and simple pack that you
03:33 - can use to populate your world then for
03:35 - another simple tool that does just one
03:36 - thing and does dwell here is a simple
03:38 - web transport like name implies this
03:40 - helps you handle Connections in a web
03:42 - build apparently this is also what
03:43 - mirror and fishnet use in the background
03:45 - so it should be very stable very robust
03:47 - soon this kind of thing can be very
03:49 - useful if you have some kind of non-game
03:51 - program that you're building in unity
03:53 - and you want to access it through the
03:54 - web it's a low level Library so it's up
03:56 - to you to Define what data you want to
03:58 - send over the network or maybe just see
04:00 - the character here is a nice Minotaur it
04:02 - really reminds me of the minotaurs that
04:03 - I fought in Oblivion it's a pretty nice
04:05 - character model with a nice double-edged
04:07 - weapon it includes the character with
04:09 - some high quality textures along with
04:10 - some 17 animations if you like this
04:12 - style then this have has tons more
04:14 - characters alright so those are my top
04:16 - 10 free new apps on the ENT Sr for July
04:18 - 23 there's a link so in the description
04:20 - and also check out my own print pass on
04:22 - sword alright hope that's useful check
04:24 - out these videos to learn some more
04:25 - thanks to these awesome patreon
04:27 - supporters for making these videos
04:28 - possible but thank you for watching and
04:30 - I'll see you next time
