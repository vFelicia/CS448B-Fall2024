00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and yesterday Unity finally announced
00:04 - some proper AI tools the secret to life
00:06 - is to find something you love to do and
00:09 - do it every day a few months ago all
00:10 - they showed was just a vague teaser but
00:12 - now we have info on actual proper tools
00:14 - one is called Muse and one is called
00:16 - sentis and beyond that there's also a
00:18 - new category on the asset store with all
00:20 - these AI tools there are obviously
00:22 - questions about copyright and what data
00:24 - sets they are using the answer is
00:26 - actually pretty vague right now I found
00:27 - a bunch of completely responses I'll
00:29 - mention what I found my research in a
00:30 - little bit but first let's look at the
00:32 - tools what they are starting with unity
00:34 - Muse which is the AI tool to assist you
00:37 - during the creation process this one has
00:39 - two parts text and sketches now on the
00:42 - text part one interesting thing that
00:44 - they mentioned in the blog post is how
00:45 - it uses AI to search through the
00:47 - documentation training resources and
00:49 - support content it is all that in order
00:51 - to get you structured accurate and
00:53 - up-to-date information from yinty now I
00:55 - find this part extremely interesting
00:56 - since one big problem with tools like
00:58 - chatgpt is housing Nations which is how
01:01 - it confidently gives you an answer even
01:03 - if it's wrong so I'm definitely very
01:05 - curious about this focus on supposedly
01:06 - accurate results including working code
01:08 - samples like I mentioned in my chatgpt
01:11 - video I would not use it to generate
01:12 - code only for brainstorming design
01:14 - questions which is exactly how I've been
01:16 - using Chachi PT in my own game Thinking
01:18 - guardians but who knows perhaps the code
01:20 - that this produces so good that I won't
01:22 - start using it honestly I really doubt
01:24 - it but I'm very curious to test this
01:26 - claim we can pause the video to see the
01:28 - answers to the question how do I make a
01:29 - match 3 game first it literally shows
01:32 - that it knows what is a metric game so
01:34 - that's a good start I wonder what would
01:35 - happen if you asked in a more obscure
01:37 - genre then it says first you need a game
01:39 - board and suggest unity's tunnel map
01:41 - system which Yip is a good option
01:43 - importantly here is the one which refers
01:45 - to the extra links on the bottom this is
01:47 - really good so people can learn more
01:48 - detail about certain topics next it
01:50 - suggests using physics now personally I
01:52 - wouldn't really use physics on a Mastery
01:54 - game but it's definitely a valid option
01:56 - it correctly tells you to use the 2D
01:58 - physics system with 2D component again
02:00 - with an extra link for extra information
02:02 - then for step 3 it actually goes quite
02:04 - vague it says you need to implement the
02:06 - core mechanics of a match 3 game so you
02:08 - need to make the scripts to handle the
02:10 - matching clearing and scoring then you
02:12 - need to spawn New pieces and move
02:13 - current pieces to fill the gaps actually
02:15 - did a Mastery game from scratch quite a
02:18 - while ago and yep I did have to do all
02:19 - this but I do find it a bit odd how the
02:22 - answer is so vague honestly this feels
02:24 - like that one meme about how to draw an
02:26 - owl how you first draw two circles and
02:28 - then you draw the rest of the owl but
02:30 - one key thing about Tunes like chechi PT
02:32 - is being able to ask follow-up questions
02:34 - so I do wonder how detailed they would
02:36 - go if you ask for more detail on this
02:38 - third point then it also makes some nice
02:40 - suggestions based on existing Unity
02:42 - tools to have things like mailboxes
02:44 - Cloud save and authentication this is
02:46 - actually a great thing because a lot of
02:47 - people might not know about tons of
02:49 - tools that ENT has I made my entire
02:51 - Unity overview course directly to answer
02:53 - this question so this is a great thing
02:54 - so all in all this is a pretty decent
02:56 - overview of what is a match 3 and how
02:58 - you could build one although again I I
03:00 - wonder if this would be enough info for
03:01 - a complete beginner I guess the answer
03:03 - really comes down to how much detail it
03:05 - would give you if you ask for firm
03:07 - clarification on that third point then
03:08 - we can see the demo it asks another
03:10 - question with some more detail on how to
03:12 - create a Sprite and rotate it so you
03:14 - import an image then it tells you
03:15 - difference between having the editor set
03:17 - up in 2D or 3D which is actually a
03:19 - pretty important thing this is something
03:20 - that can trip a beginner so this is
03:22 - really great then it gives some very
03:24 - beginner friendly instructions once
03:25 - again alongside some helpful links and
03:27 - finally gives a super simple script so
03:29 - this part this text-based tool this
03:31 - doesn't really seem anything too
03:32 - impressive but it's also not necessarily
03:34 - unimpressive it's really just like many
03:36 - other tools that already exist now much
03:38 - more interesting to me are the other
03:39 - parts of this tool how you can just use
03:42 - text to generate animations like for
03:44 - example do a backflip personally I have
03:46 - no skills as an animator so this would
03:48 - be extremely useful to me I always hate
03:50 - having to look at the accessor to find
03:51 - all kinds of Animation packs to try to
03:53 - figure out which one contains whatever
03:55 - specific animation I'm looking for so if
03:57 - I could just type some text and get a
03:59 - quick draft animation that would be
04:00 - wonderful one thing that I do hope this
04:02 - will has is refinement meaning ask a
04:05 - question and then being able to ask
04:06 - follow-ups that is something that is
04:08 - liking to almost kind of like Dolly
04:09 - where everything must be generated from
04:11 - just one prompt and you can really ask
04:13 - follow questions like can we chat GPT so
04:16 - I really hope this won't last for doing
04:17 - that like for example do a backflip okay
04:19 - now do it a bit more intense now jump a
04:21 - bit higher and so on I think that would
04:22 - be great another use case is Sprite
04:24 - texture generation but also extra
04:26 - interesting is how you can draw sketches
04:28 - so you don't don't have to generate the
04:30 - entire image with just one prompt you
04:32 - draw to select the areas you want to
04:34 - generate and then you give the prompt
04:35 - lately I've been using the Photoshop AI
04:37 - beta which has exactly this feature and
04:40 - I have found that extremely useful I
04:42 - find this workflow much better than
04:43 - having to generate the entire image with
04:45 - just one prompt this is great for
04:47 - creating tons of variation where you can
04:48 - just select one part of the image and
04:50 - easily create tons of variation for that
04:52 - although of course you can also generate
04:53 - entire things like entire textures and
04:55 - looking at the demo the generated
04:57 - materials do seem to work quite well at
04:59 - scale with no visible seams or
05:00 - repetition now the terrain does look
05:02 - pretty basic some people on Twitter were
05:04 - pointing out how this rain really looks
05:06 - like a game from the early 2000s but
05:08 - again keep in mind this is just one
05:10 - material if you were to mix multiple
05:11 - materials generated by this and you add
05:13 - a bunch of props then I think this ring
05:15 - will look quite good so this full
05:16 - material generation also seems pretty
05:18 - interesting now on the blog post they
05:20 - also mentioned how this tune will help
05:22 - you both in the editor and on the web so
05:24 - it sounds like that means there won't be
05:26 - some kind of website that you can access
05:27 - it to but then it will also will be
05:29 - accessible directly from inside the
05:31 - editor so that's great oh no from this
05:33 - tool Unity Muse I don't see much use for
05:35 - the generic text-based AI but the other
05:37 - use cases do seem externally useful I
05:40 - would love to be able to easily generate
05:41 - some animations with text and generate
05:43 - some random iterations of different
05:45 - Sprites for my games so I definitely
05:47 - can't wait to try this out and explore
05:49 - all of its limitations now the next
05:51 - signal this one is called DND centers
05:53 - and this is how you can embed an AI
05:55 - model in the UNT runtime which will run
05:57 - on every platform that Unity supports so
05:59 - that includes mobile PC web consoles and
06:01 - so on what this means is really that
06:03 - there's no Cloud hosting or no Server
06:05 - Connection needed at all once your model
06:07 - is trained it just runs locally on the
06:09 - player machines so after you train it
06:11 - there are no costs to you as developer
06:12 - and of course with this being local it
06:14 - also helps with latency which is usually
06:16 - a big problem with things like using AI
06:18 - to generate some NPC response the demo
06:21 - showcases someone talking to a character
06:22 - that is being driven by AI what
06:24 - hairstyles would you choose if you had
06:26 - hair if I had hair I would probably go
06:28 - for a mess people not plumbing through I
06:30 - like how they look on other people and I
06:33 - think they're easy to maintain now they
06:35 - don't specify exactly how AI is used I
06:37 - assume they are using AI for the initial
06:39 - speech to text recognition then probably
06:41 - using it for text to voice generation
06:43 - and perhaps even for the mouth animation
06:45 - however while the selling point on this
06:48 - is being local on device with no latency
06:50 - the video doesn't necessarily show that
06:52 - there are Cuts before every response I
06:54 - have no idea if they cut just because it
06:56 - took a bit too long to reply or really
06:58 - just make the video more interesting
06:59 - with some zooms and also on this
07:01 - specific demo on this specific use case
07:03 - personally this is something that I
07:05 - really have no interest in a while ago
07:07 - Nvidia announced another similar tool
07:09 - where again you could chat with a random
07:11 - NPC you could ask it whatever you want
07:13 - and again my reaction to that was
07:15 - exactly the same personally I have never
07:17 - once played the game where I thought to
07:19 - myself oh I wish I could talk to this
07:21 - random NPC for hours on end about
07:22 - anything that's really just something I
07:24 - have never had a desire to do in any
07:26 - game I just want to talk to the NPC get
07:28 - the info information that whatever
07:30 - designer came up with and then go ahead
07:32 - and keep doing some gameplay but then
07:34 - again that's just because personally I
07:36 - prefer some more mechanically focused
07:37 - games as opposed to things that are very
07:39 - story based so I could see that for a
07:42 - player who enjoys something like
07:43 - Adventure Point and click games for that
07:45 - I can see how it could be a selling
07:47 - point to be able to talk to every NPC
07:49 - for as long as you want now suddenly
07:51 - there's not much more detail on this
07:52 - tune the idea of having an inference
07:54 - engine running on devices potentially
07:56 - quite interesting but my bigger question
07:58 - is how exactly are you training the AI
08:00 - model so how much that does need how do
08:03 - you actually train it is it just by
08:05 - using the regular Unity ml agents
08:07 - package is sent is really just a
08:09 - rebranding or a new name for what
08:11 - they've had for a long time which was
08:13 - Barracuda it's been a long time since I
08:15 - touched them in Legends definitely want
08:16 - to get back to it at some point
08:17 - hopefully there won't be some more
08:19 - details on the specifics of how this
08:21 - tune works and then there's also an
08:23 - update for the SSR now there is a
08:25 - specific category for verified AI
08:27 - Solutions and there's already quite out
08:29 - of them Honestly by now there are
08:31 - hundreds of AI tools all over the place
08:32 - I try to keep up with the pace of AI but
08:34 - there's just way too much stuff here
08:36 - you've got some 3D asset generators some
08:38 - NPC AI dialogue and behavior there's
08:40 - some image generation voice generation
08:42 - liquids and even testing so lots of
08:45 - stuff and if you want to try it out most
08:47 - of these Tunes are free to test and by
08:49 - the way there's even more tools these up
08:50 - top are just the highlights that are
08:52 - actually verified but there's a bunch
08:54 - more that claim to use AI to do all
08:56 - kinds of things like music generation
08:57 - integration with machine learning and a
08:59 - bunch more so if you're interested go
09:01 - browse the SSR and see this category now
09:03 - for a pretty big question what data sets
09:05 - were these two on screened on and what
09:07 - about issues with copyright suddenly I
09:09 - cannot find a definitive answer when I
09:12 - spoke with the unity AI team behind
09:13 - closed doors back at GDC back then they
09:16 - told me it was extremely important for
09:18 - them to actually own the data sets which
09:19 - is excellent however over here when
09:21 - people ask for what data sets are using
09:23 - the answer is extremely vague they just
09:26 - say they license a large language model
09:28 - and FedEx some Unity docs so it sounds
09:31 - like they use something like chechi PT
09:32 - and then fine-tuned it with DNT
09:34 - knowledge but this part this really says
09:36 - absolutely nothing about the art
09:37 - generation tools however someone asked
09:40 - this question on Twitter and some of you
09:42 - replied who is the SVP of innovation at
09:44 - unity and here it says it's their own
09:46 - data set called Runa I literally cannot
09:49 - find any mention of anything called Runa
09:51 - outside of this Suite so no idea what
09:53 - that refers to is that an art asset or
09:55 - animation no idea another interesting
09:57 - tweet is by Natalie who works at
09:59 - Graphics at weather which is part of
10:01 - unity and again this says in relation to
10:03 - this weird alien creature how it was
10:05 - built on custom data which was ethically
10:07 - sourced and again my question is what
10:09 - data does that refer to is it the math
10:11 - movements is it the backflip animation
10:13 - that we saw is it the voice generation
10:14 - really no idea personally I think it is
10:17 - extremely important to be very clear
10:18 - about where the data sets came from and
10:20 - that there are no copyright issues I
10:22 - think that is absolutely essential
10:24 - before any series devs will risk using
10:26 - these zones in their commercial games so
10:28 - I really hope they clear up all this
10:29 - confusion and give a clear answer about
10:31 - each type of AI generation and which
10:33 - specific data sets they were trained on
10:34 - alright so that's the latest on unti
10:37 - tools if you're interested they are part
10:39 - of their AI better program which you can
10:41 - go sign up to gain access for the
10:42 - upcoming host beta personally I already
10:44 - signed up months ago when they first
10:46 - showed the teaser if I get access to the
10:48 - beta I'll definitely try them out so
10:49 - stay tuned alright hope that's useful
10:51 - check out these videos to learn some
10:53 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
10:55 - supporters for making these videos
10:56 - possible thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and yesterday Unity finally announced some proper AI tools the secret to life is to find something you love to do and do it every day a few months ago all they showed was just a vague teaser but now we have info on actual proper tools one is called Muse and one is called sentis and beyond that there's also a new category on the asset store with all these AI tools there are obviously questions about copyright and what data sets they are using the answer is actually pretty vague right now I found a bunch of completely responses I'll mention what I found my research in a little bit but first let's look at the tools what they are starting with unity Muse which is the AI tool to assist you during the creation process this one has two parts text and sketches now on the text part one interesting thing that they mentioned in the blog post is how it uses AI to search through the documentation training resources and support content it is all that in order to get you structured accurate and uptodate information from yinty now I find this part extremely interesting since one big problem with tools like chatgpt is housing Nations which is how it confidently gives you an answer even if it's wrong so I'm definitely very curious about this focus on supposedly accurate results including working code samples like I mentioned in my chatgpt video I would not use it to generate code only for brainstorming design questions which is exactly how I've been using Chachi PT in my own game Thinking guardians but who knows perhaps the code that this produces so good that I won't start using it honestly I really doubt it but I'm very curious to test this claim we can pause the video to see the answers to the question how do I make a match 3 game

this but I do find it a bit odd how the answer is so vague honestly this feels like that one meme about how to draw an owl how you first draw two circles and then you draw the rest of the owl but one key thing about Tunes like chechi PT is being able to ask followup questions so I do wonder how detailed they would go if you ask for more detail on this third point then it also makes some nice suggestions based on existing Unity tools to have things like mailboxes Cloud save and authentication this is actually a great thing because a lot of people might not know about tons of tools that ENT has I made my entire Unity overview course directly to answer this question so this is a great thing so all in all this is a pretty decent overview of what is a match 3 and how you could build one although again I I wonder if this would be enough info for a complete beginner I guess the answer really comes down to how much detail it would give you if you ask for firm clarification on that third point then we can see the demo it asks another question with some more detail on how to create a Sprite and rotate it so you import an image then it tells you difference between having the editor set up in 2D or 3D which is actually a pretty important thing this is something that can trip a beginner so this is really great then it gives some very beginner friendly instructions once again alongside some helpful links and finally gives a super simple script so this part this textbased tool this doesn't really seem anything too impressive but it's also not necessarily unimpressive it's really just like many other tools that already exist now much more interesting to me are the other parts of this tool how you can just use text to generate animations like for example do a backflip personally I have no skills as an animator so this would be extremely useful to me I always hate having to look at the accessor to find all kinds of Animation packs to try to figure out which one contains whatever specific animation I'm looking for so if I could just type some text and get a quick draft animation that would be wonderful one thing that I do hope this will has is refinement meaning ask a question

can we chat GPT so I really hope this won't last for doing that like for example do a backflip okay now do it a bit more intense now jump a bit higher and so on I think that would be great another use case is Sprite texture generation but also extra interesting is how you can draw sketches so you don't don't have to generate the entire image with just one prompt you draw to select the areas you want to generate and then you give the prompt lately I've been using the Photoshop AI beta which has exactly this feature and I have found that extremely useful I find this workflow much better than having to generate the entire image with just one prompt this is great for creating tons of variation where you can just select one part of the image and easily create tons of variation for that although of course you can also generate entire things like entire textures and looking at the demo the generated materials do seem to work quite well at scale with no visible seams or repetition now the terrain does look pretty basic some people on Twitter were pointing out how this rain really looks like a game from the early 2000s but again keep in mind this is just one material if you were to

they also mentioned how this tune will help you both in the editor and on the web so it sounds like that means there won't be some kind of website that you can access it to but then it will also will

interested go browse the SSR and see this category now for a pretty big question what data sets were these two on screened on and what about issues with copyright suddenly I cannot find a definitive answer when I spoke with the unity AI team behind closed doors back at GDC back then they told me it was extremely important for them to actually own the data sets which is excellent however over here when people ask for what data sets are using the answer is extremely vague they just say they license a large language model and FedEx some Unity docs so it sounds like they use something like chechi PT and then finetuned it with DNT knowledge but this part this really says absolutely nothing about the art generation tools however someone asked this question on Twitter and some of you replied who is the SVP of innovation at unity and here it says it's their own data set called Runa I literally cannot find any mention of anything called Runa outside of this Suite so no idea what that refers to is that an art asset or animation no idea another interesting tweet is by Natalie who works at Graphics at weather which is part of unity and again this says in relation to this weird alien creature how it was built on custom data which was ethically sourced and again my question is what data does that refer to is it the math movements is it the backflip animation that we saw is it the voice generation really no idea personally I think it is extremely important to be very clear about where the data sets came from and that there are no copyright issues I think that is absolutely essential before any series devs will risk using these zones in their commercial games so I really hope they clear up all this confusion and give a clear answer about each type of AI generation and which specific data sets they were trained on alright so that's the latest on unti tools if you're interested they are part of their AI better program which you can go sign up to gain access for the upcoming host beta personally I already signed up months ago when they first showed the teaser if I get access to the beta I'll definitely try them out so stay tuned alright hope that's useful check
