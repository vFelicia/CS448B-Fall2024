00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so here's a challenge making open World
00:04 - Games is generally really difficult
00:05 - that's one of those genres where it
00:07 - really takes a triple A team so kind of
00:09 - similar to MMOs however nowadays there
00:11 - are tons of really awesome tools that
00:13 - can help you make a game just like that
00:14 - so the challenge is using all of these
00:16 - tools and assets at my disposal can I
00:18 - make an open world game in one week
00:19 - that's the challenge that I attempted so
00:21 - let's see if I manage to achieve this
00:23 - goal stick around to the end to see the
00:25 - final result and check the link in the
00:26 - description for a list of all the
00:28 - essence tools that I used in making this
00:29 - a reality and actually right now all of
00:31 - those are on sale as part of the UNT
00:32 - summer sale on the S store you can find
00:35 - anything from visuals effects tools game
00:37 - templates Shader systems and a bunch
00:39 - more tons of awesome stuff all that any
00:41 - nice discounts so check it out with the
00:43 - link in the description also this video
00:45 - is sponsored by unity so I start my
00:47 - challenge with the most obvious thing
00:48 - which is actually on making the map this
00:50 - is actually a topic that I've wanted to
00:51 - research for quite some time making
00:53 - large worlds like this one requires
00:54 - connecting multiple terrains together
00:56 - and actually streaming them in and out
00:57 - of memory so for that this was the
00:59 - perfect excuse to learn how to use the
01:01 - tool that I've been meaning to look at
01:02 - for quite some time that to only this
01:04 - guy which is a warm building tool it's
01:06 - one of the highest rated assets on the
01:07 - store it has thousands of five star
01:09 - reviews although I was always a little
01:10 - bit intimidated because it's such a
01:12 - powerful and complex serial so it takes
01:14 - a bit to learn but if you want to make
01:15 - an open Run game then a tone like this
01:17 - one is absolutely perfect and actually
01:19 - after diving through the documentation
01:21 - learning how to use it it is actually
01:22 - surprisingly easy it has tons of options
01:24 - to enable you to get the exact open
01:26 - world that you want to build but if you
01:28 - just want something basic then just
01:29 - following the guided setup that will
01:31 - make you quite a really nice world now
01:32 - importantly this also handles the thing
01:34 - that I thought was going to be extremely
01:36 - complex which is the world streaming and
01:38 - guy already handles that automatically
01:40 - we need to find the world size you
01:41 - define it as the size per each terrain
01:43 - as well as the towns for how many
01:45 - terrains you've got on the X and the y
01:47 - axis then when you generate everything
01:49 - is already generated split per each in
01:51 - rain and then it automatically streams
01:53 - those pieces in and out as you move
01:54 - through them so here is a huge open
01:56 - world that I can fly around and all of
01:58 - the various pieces as you can see there
01:59 - are all automatically streamed it's
02:01 - really impressive how easy this was to
02:03 - set up if I were to build this whole
02:05 - system by myself it would have taken me
02:06 - months whereas over here by using this
02:09 - um I just spent a few hours reading
02:10 - their documentation doing some testing
02:11 - and here it is a nice functional open
02:13 - world so this is a really great
02:15 - practical example of how using great
02:17 - tools can massively speed up your
02:18 - development and help you save months or
02:20 - even years of development then with the
02:22 - basic map working I got it set it up to
02:24 - unlock example like I wanted I wanted
02:26 - something like a dark alien sci-fi
02:28 - planet and for that the first thing that
02:30 - I did is one of the things that I've
02:31 - talked about many times previously in
02:33 - the channel one of the simplest things
02:34 - you can do to greatly improve the vision
02:36 - for your game is just changing out the
02:37 - Skybox for that I use the on Sky pack
02:40 - which is a huge pack with over 200
02:42 - skyboxes everything from some hyper
02:44 - realistic ones to some anime ones in
02:46 - this case I picked one that looked nice
02:47 - in sci-fi nice and dark just change the
02:49 - colors for the directional light a
02:51 - little bit and everything already
02:52 - unlocked immediately different and now
02:54 - that the map was done it was time to
02:56 - work on the player I wanted a first
02:58 - person player with first person hands
03:00 - this is another topic that I've been
03:01 - meaning to look at and finally this was
03:03 - the perfect reason to do that I found a
03:05 - nice pack with some first person hands
03:06 - and animations now it is very important
03:08 - that the hands are actually ringed so
03:10 - that I can actually build some
03:11 - animations although the animations
03:13 - included in this bag those are already
03:15 - right it already includes some magic
03:17 - animations which is perfect for example
03:19 - what I want then with the animations
03:20 - working I needed some kind of character
03:22 - controller so yet again I took this
03:24 - opportunity to look into another asset
03:26 - that I've been meaning to look at it's
03:27 - the kinematic character controller and
03:29 - this one actually used to be paid then
03:31 - was made free just a while ago this is
03:33 - one of the highest rated character
03:34 - controls on the store it supports pretty
03:36 - much any terrain so it works on slopes
03:38 - edges steps and so on it even has custom
03:40 - inverted gravity so it's really
03:42 - adaptable so anyways I just imported
03:44 - this one into the project I added my
03:46 - first person hands on top and with that
03:48 - I had my nice first person controller
03:49 - with that done I then just took my
03:51 - working character controller with the
03:53 - hands picked it up from my testing scene
03:54 - and drop it on the map scene and just
03:56 - with that here is my character working
03:58 - falsely I've got a character with my
03:59 - nice hands and animation perfectly
04:01 - walking around this fast huge open world
04:03 - terrain again it's really impressive how
04:05 - I got this far this quickly just by
04:07 - using a ton of really useful tools and
04:09 - assets then the next thing that I wanted
04:10 - was a plane to travel long distances in
04:13 - my mind I was thinking something like
04:14 - just cause where you can essentially
04:16 - spawn a plane that spawns in front of
04:17 - you and you can use it to travel long
04:18 - distances so I grabbed a plane visual
04:21 - from the sentient military pack however
04:23 - I also did not want it to look like a
04:25 - regular plane this game is meant to be
04:26 - kind of sci-fi and for that I actually
04:29 - used another Super useful tool called
04:30 - colorize this one lets you easily change
04:33 - colors for specific parts of the mesh
04:34 - and it works especially well on low poly
04:36 - meshes you can change the color and
04:38 - importantly you can also change or add a
04:40 - mission so in my case I spent a little
04:42 - bit of time just reading documentation
04:43 - learning about this tool then I just
04:45 - changed the color of the plane on
04:46 - various parts and added some emission to
04:48 - the engines yet another excellent way of
04:50 - improving the visuals for your game is
04:52 - just using a nice custom Shader for this
04:54 - use case there are tons and tons of
04:55 - excellent examples on the store there's
04:57 - many really useful really creative
04:58 - shaders personally I always really enjoy
05:01 - the anime aesthetic so I pick quimly
05:03 - this one is a great asset with tons of
05:05 - options to help you make your game sound
05:06 - Shaden which by the way this is also the
05:08 - exact same Shader that I'm using in my
05:10 - own upcoming steam game dinky Guardians
05:12 - go ahead and edit your wishlist so I
05:14 - have this Shader to the plane and the
05:15 - character's hands and everything looks
05:17 - great then while the player is in first
05:19 - person the enemies are going to be in
05:21 - third person so for that I need some
05:22 - third person animations and for the
05:24 - enemies I wanted them to pretty much
05:25 - just use some melee attacks and for that
05:27 - I found this excellent pack with a bunch
05:29 - of fighting animations the character I'm
05:31 - using is taken from another city pack
05:33 - and it's a regular humanoid character so
05:35 - it already Works automatically with any
05:36 - humanoid animation however for this
05:39 - particular pack this one with some funny
05:40 - animations this one only has fighting
05:42 - animations so it actually doesn't have
05:43 - something basic like a basic one for the
05:46 - animation now thankfully Unity actually
05:48 - has a third person accent it's a
05:50 - character controller that also includes
05:52 - some basic animations so I just use the
05:54 - basic wonk animation from that pack and
05:55 - all the attack animations from the other
05:57 - pack then I get to work on the plane
05:59 - controller this is another thing that I
06:00 - could probably use an essay from the
06:02 - store but I wanted something pretty
06:03 - basic so I just built it myself the
06:05 - tricky part was only handling the
06:06 - rotation since planes can rotate in any
06:08 - axis I did it like I normally do by just
06:11 - changing the Euler angles and that
06:13 - actually caused it to break down
06:14 - completely although thankfully this
06:15 - solution was pretty simple just rotate
06:17 - using quaternions instead of Euler
06:19 - angles and with that yep the plane was
06:21 - working I just added some forward
06:22 - movement I made a basic script for
06:24 - spawning the plane grabbing onto it and
06:26 - jumping out so pretty much the exact
06:28 - same logic that you see in some games
06:30 - like just cause it's a great mechanic
06:32 - for large open World Games next was
06:34 - making some basic enemy AI I use a super
06:37 - simple State machine pretty much it
06:38 - doesn't like I covered in a video a long
06:40 - time ago it just finds a Player move
06:42 - towards it and attacks the animations
06:43 - are triggered so all of it is pretty
06:45 - simple for the player it also needs some
06:48 - attacks so I made it shoot bolts out of
06:50 - the hands for the awesome particles I
06:52 - use the all-in-one VFX toolkit this one
06:54 - isn't actually an asset with just a
06:56 - bunch of particle effects but rather
06:57 - it's a tool for making particle effects
06:59 - although so it does come with some
07:01 - pre-made particles so I use some of
07:03 - those and only added some slight
07:04 - modifications the other part is the
07:07 - animation for shooting bolts out of the
07:08 - hands the hand animation did have some
07:10 - handshoot animations but the wind up was
07:12 - a bit waiting long so here's a quick
07:15 - empty tab that also covered in a
07:16 - previous video if you have some
07:18 - animation that you download from NASA
07:20 - pack chances are it won't show up as
07:21 - read-only so you cannot modify it but
07:23 - you can select the animation duplicate
07:25 - it and now the duplicate the animation
07:27 - that one will be editable I did just
07:29 - that and then I cut the first three
07:30 - frames to make it nice and snappy then
07:32 - since I have attacks I also needed some
07:34 - way to deal on damage and for that I
07:36 - actually use my own free has it the
07:38 - health system it's a super basic account
07:40 - system I just attach it to the enemy
07:42 - added some basic Collision logic to the
07:44 - projectiles added some extra particles
07:46 - on hit and that's it it's done also the
07:49 - main part of this open world game is in
07:50 - our Castle's place all over the world
07:52 - the way the player captures those
07:54 - castles is by destroying the castle
07:55 - heart so for building this once again I
07:57 - use a bunch of prefabs from the
07:59 - all-in-one VFX pack I just played with
08:01 - some settings to make it a little bit
08:03 - more chaotic so added a bunch more
08:04 - Distortion then I just made a nice
08:06 - animation with a cinemasion camera to
08:08 - make it rotate around go up and increase
08:09 - the size of all the facts just did
08:11 - something like that and the end result
08:13 - looks pretty nice with that part down
08:15 - then I polish the logic for jumping on
08:17 - the plane this required making some
08:19 - slight custom animations for example the
08:21 - pack that I was using for the hands is
08:22 - to have any animation for bringing the
08:24 - hand down and for editing and creating
08:26 - animations directly inside Unity for
08:28 - that I use a super useful tool called
08:29 - umotion it's a really great asset if you
08:32 - want to animate directly inside Unity
08:33 - it's especially great because for
08:35 - example with humanoid animations you
08:37 - cannot edit them inside Unity by default
08:39 - but you can with this asset so I made
08:41 - some simple animations coupled with some
08:43 - simple effects I also made a simple
08:45 - Trail render that is shot towards the
08:46 - plane and without jumping up to the
08:48 - plane looks pretty great next was
08:50 - handling the logic for when the player
08:52 - captures a castle I want the world to
08:54 - essentially change color how I did that
08:56 - was some basic logic that played around
08:58 - within light and the volume weight it's
09:00 - just some basic logic checking the
09:01 - player distance to the castle and seeing
09:03 - if the castle has already been captured
09:05 - with that done I got busy on manually
09:07 - placing castles all over this huge world
09:09 - then I made a minimap although this time
09:11 - since I won the full map I did not
09:13 - actually do it like I covered in a
09:15 - previous video where I use a second
09:16 - camera instead of over here I just took
09:18 - a screenshot of the entire world and
09:20 - made a texture then manually placed all
09:22 - the castle icons after that I also used
09:25 - my own asset the mouse cursor system Pro
09:26 - this is a super easy to use asset that
09:29 - allows you to add custom animated
09:30 - cursors to your game in this case I just
09:32 - attached some basic components and use a
09:35 - nice attack cursor on top of the castles
09:36 - and a move cursor elsewhere it's a super
09:39 - simple addition but looks really nice
09:40 - then I also implemented a nice Waypoint
09:43 - mechanic I can click anywhere in the map
09:45 - and it will spawn a huge Waypoint that
09:47 - is visible from very far away this is
09:49 - great for navigation in this huge open
09:50 - world then I populated all the castles
09:52 - with enemies and I use the excellent
09:54 - a-star pathfinding project to make them
09:56 - avoid walls put it all together and here
09:58 - is the final game
10:00 - alright so here I've got my player
10:02 - character I can walk around I can shoot
10:04 - volts from my arms
10:06 - I can also open up the map to see where
10:07 - I am in this huge open world
10:10 - and I can see I'm right next to a nice
10:11 - Castle so let's go into down
10:14 - so let's fall straight there
10:17 - and if there's a castle right there so
10:19 - let's approach it
10:20 - and as soon as we go inside yep we do
10:22 - see a whole bunch of enemies so let's
10:24 - try to take them out and avoid them as
10:25 - they try to attack me
10:34 - all right on the enemies are down so now
10:35 - I can take out the castle heart so just
10:38 - fire tons of Bones get it down and there
10:40 - you go a really nice death animation
10:42 - there you go shaking going up
10:48 - any of the castle heart is gone the
10:50 - castle has been captured so the light up
10:52 - there turned green and the visuals on
10:55 - the post processing don't also change so
10:57 - instead of being very dark now there's
10:59 - quite a bit of light now I can use the
11:01 - map again and see okay there's another
11:02 - Castle up there so let's go there I can
11:04 - place the Waypoint and if there's the
11:06 - Waypoint so let's summon in my plane and
11:09 - let me go straight onto it and again I'm
11:11 - on my plane so now I'm traveling a nice
11:13 - long distance super fast and right now
11:15 - the color has changed because I entered
11:17 - into enemy territory and there it is my
11:19 - Waypoint and the castle so I can now
11:21 - jump out and there you go the plane
11:23 - these pawns and here I've Got Another
11:24 - Castle that I can now capture
11:27 - so now you go inside I take out all the
11:29 - enemies then I take out the heart
11:36 - and if there is another Castle nice and
11:38 - captured alright so that's a game that I
11:40 - built now looking at this I would say
11:42 - that I did complete the challenge
11:43 - successfully I did indeed manage to make
11:45 - an open world game all by myself in a
11:47 - pretty short period of time so this is a
11:49 - great practical example of just how
11:51 - powerful and great tones can be how a
11:53 - solo Indie Dev nowadays can do something
11:55 - that previously would have taken weeks
11:56 - and a team of hundreds of people all the
11:59 - stones that are used are currently on
12:00 - sale on the SSR as part of their summer
12:02 - sale so if you'd like to make a game
12:04 - like this one definitely look into those
12:05 - Hills and check out everything else on
12:07 - the sale you can find anything from
12:09 - visuals effects tools game templates
12:11 - Shader systems and a bunch more there's
12:13 - tons of awesome stuff all of it with a
12:15 - nice discount so check out the tools
12:17 - that I use Link in the description and
12:18 - perhaps challenge yourself to build
12:20 - something that would have been
12:21 - previously impossible and use all the
12:22 - tools at your disposal to bring your
12:24 - vision to life alright hope that's
12:26 - useful check out these videos to learn
12:27 - some more thanks to these awesome
12:29 - patreon supporters for making these
12:31 - videos possible thank you for watching
12:33 - and I'll see you next time
12:38 - [Music]
12:40 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so here's a challenge making open World Games is generally really difficult that's one of those genres where it really takes a triple A team so kind of similar to MMOs however nowadays there are tons of really awesome tools that can help you make a game just like that so the challenge is using all of these tools and assets at my disposal can I make an open world game in one week that's the challenge that I attempted so let's see if I manage to achieve this goal stick around to the end to see the final result and check the link in the description for a list of all the essence tools that I used in making this a reality and actually right now all of those are on sale as part of the UNT summer sale on the S store you can find anything from visuals effects tools game templates Shader systems and a bunch more tons of awesome stuff all that any nice discounts so check it out with the link in the description also this video is sponsored by unity so I start my challenge with the most obvious thing which is actually on making the map this is actually a topic that I've wanted to research for quite some time making large worlds like this one requires connecting multiple terrains together and actually streaming them in and out of memory so for that this was the perfect excuse to learn how to use the tool that I've been meaning to look at for quite some time that to only this guy which is a warm building tool it's one of the highest rated assets on the store it has thousands of five star reviews although I was always a little bit intimidated because it's such a powerful and complex serial so it takes a bit to learn but if you want to make an open Run game then a tone like this one is absolutely perfect and actually after diving through the documentation learning how to use it it is actually surprisingly easy it has tons of options to enable you to get the exact open world that you want to build but if you just want something basic then just following the guided setup that will make you quite a really nice world now importantly this also handles the thing that I thought was going to be extremely complex which is the world streaming and guy already handles that automatically we need to find the world size you define it as the size per each terrain as well as the towns for how many terrains you've got on the X

steam game dinky Guardians go ahead and edit your wishlist so I have this Shader to the plane and the character's hands and everything looks great then while the player is in first person the enemies are going to be in third person so for that I need some third person animations and for the enemies I wanted them to pretty much just use some melee attacks and for that I found this excellent pack with a bunch of fighting animations the character I'm using is taken from another city pack and it's a regular humanoid character so it already Works automatically with any humanoid animation however for this particular pack this one with some funny animations this one only has fighting animations so it actually doesn't have something basic like a basic one for the animation now thankfully Unity actually has a third person accent it's a character controller that also includes some basic animations so I just use the basic wonk animation from that pack and all the attack animations from the other pack then I get to work on the plane controller this is another thing that I could probably use an essay from the store but I wanted something pretty basic so I just built it myself the tricky part was only handling the rotation since planes can rotate in any axis I did it like I normally do by just changing the Euler angles and that actually caused it to break down completely although thankfully this solution was pretty simple just rotate using quaternions instead of Euler angles and with that yep the plane was working I just added some forward movement I made a basic script for spawning the plane grabbing onto it and jumping out so pretty much the exact same logic that you see in some games like just cause it's a great mechanic for large open World Games next was making some basic enemy AI I use a super simple State machine pretty much it doesn't like I covered in a video a long time ago it just finds a Player move towards it and attacks the animations are triggered so all of it is pretty simple for the player it also needs some attacks so I made it shoot bolts out of the hands for the awesome particles I use the allinone VFX toolkit this one isn't actually an asset with just a bunch of particle effects but rather it's a tool for making particle effects although so it does come with some premade particles so I use some of those and only added some slight modifications the other part is the animation for shooting bolts out of the hands the hand animation did have some handshoot animations but the wind up was a bit waiting long so here's a quick empty tab that also covered in a previous video if you have some animation that you download from NASA pack chances are it won't show up as readonly so you cannot modify it but you can select the animation duplicate it and now the duplicate the animation that one will be editable I did just that and then I cut the first three frames to make it nice and snappy then since I have attacks I also needed some way to deal on damage and for that I actually use my own free has it the health system it's a super basic account system I just attach it to the enemy added some basic Collision logic to the projectiles added some extra particles on hit and that's it it's done also the main part of this open world game is in our Castle's place all over the world the way the player captures those castles is by destroying the castle heart so for building this once again I use a bunch of prefabs from the allinone VFX pack I just played with some settings to make it a little bit more chaotic so added a bunch more Distortion then I just made a nice animation with a cinemasion camera to make it rotate around go up and increase the size of all the facts just did something like that and the end result looks pretty nice with that part down then I polish the logic for jumping on the plane this required making some slight custom animations for example the pack that I was using for the hands is to have any animation for bringing the hand down and for editing and creating animations directly inside Unity for that I use a super useful tool called umotion it's a really great asset if you want to animate directly inside Unity it's especially great because for example with humanoid animations you cannot edit them inside Unity by default but you can with this asset so I made some simple animations coupled with some simple effects I also made a simple Trail render that is shot towards the plane and without jumping up to the plane looks pretty great next was handling the logic for when the player captures a castle I want the world to essentially change color how I did that was some basic logic that played around within light and the volume weight it's just some basic logic checking the player distance to the castle and seeing if the castle has already been captured with that done I got busy on manually placing castles all over this huge world then I made a minimap although this time since I won the full map I did not actually do it like I covered in a previous video where I use a second camera instead of over here I just took a screenshot of the entire world and made a texture then manually placed all the castle icons after that I also used my own asset the mouse cursor system Pro this is a super easy to use asset that allows you to add custom animated cursors to your game in this case I just attached some basic components and use a nice attack cursor on top of the castles and a move cursor elsewhere it's a super simple addition but looks really nice then I also implemented a nice Waypoint mechanic I can click anywhere in the map and it will spawn a huge Waypoint that is visible from very far away this is great for navigation in this huge open world then I populated all the castles with enemies and I use the excellent astar pathfinding project to make them avoid walls put it all together and here is the final game alright so here I've got my player character I can walk around I can shoot volts from my arms I can also open up the map to see where I am in this huge open world and I can see I'm right next to a nice Castle so let's go into down so let's fall straight there and if there's a castle right there so let's approach it and as soon as we go inside yep we do see a whole bunch of enemies so let's try to take them out and avoid them as they try to attack me all right on the enemies are down so now I can take out the castle heart so just fire tons of Bones get it down and there you go a really nice death animation there you go shaking going up any of the castle heart is gone the castle has been captured so the light up there turned green and the visuals on the post processing don't also change so instead of being very dark now there's quite a bit of light now I can use the map again and see okay there's another Castle up there so let's go there I can place the Waypoint and if there's the Waypoint so let's summon in my plane and let me go straight onto it and again I'm on my plane so now I'm traveling a nice long distance super fast and right now the color has changed because I entered into enemy territory and there it is my Waypoint and the castle so I can now jump out and there you go the plane these pawns and here I've Got Another Castle that I can now capture so now you go inside I take out all the enemies then I take out the heart and if there is another Castle nice and captured alright so that's a game that I built now looking at this I would say that I did complete the challenge successfully I did indeed manage to make an open world game all by myself in a pretty short period of time so this is a great practical example of just how powerful and great tones can be how a solo Indie Dev nowadays can do something that previously would have taken weeks and a team of hundreds of people all the stones that are used are currently on sale on the SSR as part of their summer sale so if you'd like to make a game like this one definitely look into those Hills and check out everything else on the sale you can find anything from visuals effects tools game templates Shader systems and a bunch more there's tons of awesome stuff all of it with a nice discount so check out the tools that I use Link in the description and perhaps challenge yourself to build something that would have been previously impossible and use all the tools at your disposal to bring your vision to life alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
