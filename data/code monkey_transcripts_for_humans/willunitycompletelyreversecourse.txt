00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - okay so here let's analyze what I think
00:04 - will happen next also look at some
00:06 - answers on why this even happened then
00:08 - my advice on some changes that Unity
00:10 - could make and finally my advice to you
00:11 - going forward but first just the quick
00:13 - question in the title will ENT roll back
00:15 - these changes right now A lot of people
00:16 - are wondering if this truly is the
00:18 - platform or if there's a tiny chance for
00:20 - a reversal my quick answer is if you're
00:22 - waiting for a reversal then I would say
00:24 - don't wait if a phone reversal is the
00:26 - absolute only thing that would keep you
00:27 - in unity if so or simply if you film
00:30 - trust is damage Beyond repair then my
00:32 - simple advice is just move on to
00:33 - something else because personally I do
00:35 - not believe a big reversal is coming
00:36 - here are three reasons on why I think
00:38 - that now when I made the second video on
00:40 - this topic which was one day after the
00:42 - announcement and pretty much everything
00:43 - was on fire back then I generally
00:45 - believe there was a potential for a
00:47 - reversal considering the intensity of
00:48 - the backlash but given the recent
00:50 - updates where all they did was clarify
00:52 - what cuts as an insole and basically
00:54 - just to find some exceptions based on
00:55 - that it does seem like a reversal is
00:57 - really not coming at all at best they
00:59 - are willing to do do some compromises
01:01 - like we saw the exception on charity
01:02 - bundles demos and reinstalls but it
01:04 - generally does seem like they are really
01:06 - committed to going down this path
01:07 - basically since then the backlash has
01:09 - continued there's even a Twitter account
01:10 - tracking all these statements from all
01:12 - the various Studios who pretty much have
01:13 - just said they're not going to use int
01:15 - anymore basically the general consensus
01:17 - is there are devs there are in the
01:18 - middle of development and they won't
01:19 - keep using Unity to the end but most of
01:21 - them they feel that this is done
01:23 - irreparable harm and can no longer trust
01:25 - unity and will no longer use it in
01:26 - future projects so basically with that
01:28 - that's another reason why I don't think
01:29 - there will be a reversal basically a lot
01:32 - of people have already made up their
01:33 - minds and they won't quit UNT regardless
01:35 - of what happens so if you were to play
01:37 - Devil's Advocate and look at the Quant
01:38 - hard facts from minty side they
01:40 - basically got two options they can
01:42 - either revert this pricing or they can
01:44 - keep it now if they revert then those
01:47 - people who film this own situation has
01:48 - broken trust Beyond repair those will
01:50 - not return so they've still quit unity
01:53 - and of course by reverting the changes
01:55 - they obviously won't make any revenue
01:56 - from this thing whereas if they keep the
01:58 - new pricing then the have still quite
02:00 - TNT just the same but they do get extra
02:03 - Revenue perhaps the ones that say and
02:05 - pay the fee perhaps it won't be enough
02:06 - to offset the loss of all of these
02:08 - licenses so basically if you play that
02:10 - one's that there's really no benefit on
02:11 - them to go back so that's another reason
02:13 - why I really don't believe there won't
02:15 - be a reversal I think at this point they
02:16 - are really committed to going down this
02:17 - path no matter what and yet another
02:19 - reason is something that they actually
02:20 - themselves say on the various official
02:22 - posts they mentioned how these changes
02:24 - will not affect 90 of customers meaning
02:26 - they only impact the top 10 percent now
02:28 - unt's business is very top heavy they
02:30 - really only make money from a tiny
02:32 - handful of super huge devs those are
02:34 - devs that make things like engine impact
02:35 - and Marvel snap those are the ones that
02:37 - really make the money meaning that
02:39 - looking at all the posts on this Twitter
02:41 - account have gone through pretty much
02:42 - all of them and all I see are Indie devs
02:44 - the reality is unity's customers aren't
02:46 - really Indies like you or me it's the
02:48 - developers making the mega hits so in
02:50 - terms of backlash against these changes
02:51 - those aren't really the only ones that
02:52 - matter and I cannot find any public
02:55 - statements from those big developers
02:56 - although I assume there are some serious
02:58 - discussions happening behind all zores
03:00 - again at this point it really goes back
03:01 - to Simple Math if all of these
03:03 - developers quit but the likes of Marvel
03:05 - snap stays and happily pays the fee if
03:07 - so then it can actually be a net
03:08 - positive for them in terms of short-term
03:10 - profits so again if you're hoping for a
03:12 - phone reversal I don't believe it won't
03:13 - happen now if you're curious as to why
03:15 - this fee even came to be why this idea
03:17 - was even thought of in the first place
03:19 - there's a great Twitter thread with tons
03:21 - and tons of infos by someone who was
03:22 - there in the very early stages of this
03:24 - discussion which apparently happened one
03:25 - year ago now I highly encourage you to
03:27 - read this home thread if you want to get
03:29 - an inside look on why all this happened
03:30 - basically the core idea is that UNT
03:32 - spends a ton of money making the engine
03:34 - relevant supporting tons of unique
03:36 - platforms that is certainly very
03:37 - expensive and for the most part UNT has
03:40 - not made a profit I believe they only
03:41 - went into the green for these last two
03:42 - quarters and with interest rates rising
03:45 - and investment dollars pretty much
03:46 - drying up they desperately need more
03:47 - Revenue they can't really go back in the
03:49 - red just like it says here 80 of users
03:51 - don't pay anything at all basically it's
03:53 - the ads business that runs the engine
03:54 - now most people see UNT as a game engine
03:57 - that does ads on the side but the
03:59 - business reality is actually on the
04:00 - exact opposite Unity is really in that
04:02 - company with an engine on the side so
04:04 - they desperately need to get more money
04:05 - but ads are based on how many games
04:07 - people play and how much advertisers pay
04:09 - meaning they don't have much control
04:11 - over that what they can directly control
04:12 - is indeed get more revenue from the
04:14 - engine side of the business by
04:15 - introducing as a ref share or just like
04:17 - we saw a per game fee so this is yet
04:19 - another reason why it really does not
04:21 - seem that they are unlikely to go back
04:22 - on this they desperately need to make
04:24 - the company profitable in any way now if
04:26 - they are truly committed to going down
04:28 - this path if a complete reversal is
04:29 - absolutely not in the cards then here
04:31 - are my suggestions for how to make
04:33 - pretty much the best of a bad situation
04:34 - also before I mention my suggestions
04:37 - here is the same disclaimer that I made
04:39 - in my very first video I am a steam pc
04:41 - solo Indie Dev so my suggestions are
04:44 - coming from that one very specific point
04:45 - of view I am not a mobile expert I am
04:48 - not a free-to-play expert so I do hope
04:50 - that Unity won't listen to my
04:52 - suggestions but I also hope that they
04:54 - won't consult experts in all the other
04:55 - areas of game development when deciding
04:58 - what specific changes to implement the
04:59 - industry tree is huge and changes that
05:01 - might be good for one sector might be
05:03 - terrible for another one Unity have
05:04 - mentioned how the spirit of this program
05:06 - is really for them to succeed when
05:07 - developers succeed they have mentioned
05:09 - how it's not their intention to bankrupt
05:11 - anyone but right now just based on these
05:13 - rules just based on this chart it is
05:14 - technically possible for a developer to
05:16 - go bankrupt basically if your Revenue
05:18 - per user is under the fee amount then
05:20 - you're pretty much on the path to
05:21 - bankruptcy or simply just the case that
05:23 - they're talking about revenue and not
05:24 - profit so if your profit margins are so
05:27 - small that you cannot afford the fee
05:28 - then once again you go down to
05:29 - bankruptcy back to this Twitter thread
05:31 - there's actually a nice graph over here
05:33 - with some nice math and this personally
05:35 - shows the problem with the Pern sound
05:37 - model here you can see how some examples
05:39 - of fee is actually pretty fair for
05:40 - example up here Pokemon go they would
05:42 - pay literally 0.1 percent their revenue
05:44 - I think anyone would call 0.1 percent to
05:47 - be perfectly reasonable and also we can
05:48 - see that it is much better when compared
05:50 - to a flight Revenue share model so for
05:52 - Pokemon go making 60k under the parent
05:54 - selfie they would pay 60 bucks whereas
05:57 - under unreal is five percent they would
05:58 - pay three grand so definitely a much
06:00 - better deal however while the view works
06:03 - fine for this one case which is heavily
06:04 - monetizing its users it absolutely
06:06 - completely fails on games like for
06:07 - example over here Among Us in this case
06:09 - the FIFA Among Us would be a whopping 55
06:12 - or for an even worse result here is a
06:14 - hyper casual game called Bridge race and
06:16 - for this one the fee would actually be
06:18 - 180 now that is obviously completely
06:20 - insane if your fee is higher than your
06:22 - Revenue then you can obviously only end
06:24 - in bankruptcy and over here the
06:26 - following comments will point out
06:27 - exactly the same problem and basically
06:29 - the proposed solution is it would be
06:31 - individually negotiated with UNT so
06:33 - basically as things sent right now
06:34 - basically you would have to trust their
06:35 - intentions you would have to trust that
06:37 - they generally do not wish the bankrupt
06:39 - developers and you would also need to
06:40 - trust that if this scenario were to
06:42 - happen they would actually make an
06:43 - exception and help you not go bankrupt
06:45 - but right now obviously trust is
06:47 - something that UNT lacks so here's my
06:49 - very simple feedback on this issue if
06:51 - the intention is genuinely to merely
06:53 - make money when developers also make
06:54 - money and not bankrupt them if that
06:56 - truly and genuinely is the intention
06:58 - behind this fee then I believe believe
07:00 - that the rules should clearly reflect
07:01 - that meaning my suggestion would be just
07:03 - at a simple Revenue cap something like
07:05 - three percent or five percent so the fee
07:07 - would either be the parent selfie or the
07:09 - revenue royalty whichever one is most so
07:11 - in this example on Pokemon go would pay
07:13 - 60 bucks and then Among Us would pay
07:15 - four bucks again if the goal is indeed
07:17 - to only succeed when developers succeed
07:18 - then I believe that this very simple
07:20 - rule would make that call a reality
07:21 - while keeping developers safe from these
07:23 - insane edge cases now for some more
07:25 - feedback my suggestion regarding the
07:27 - issues with insounds on different
07:29 - devices again in Tia said it is not in
07:31 - the spirit that this program to
07:32 - overcharge the bumpers that's why they
07:34 - want back the fee on green songs and
07:35 - demos but they still confirm that it
07:37 - sounds on different devices those will
07:39 - be charged and the reason for that is
07:41 - because they don't want to track
07:42 - identity across devices that would
07:44 - pretty much break a ton of privacy laws
07:46 - I can understand how it's secondly
07:48 - impossible to track this over multiple
07:49 - devices without breaking those laws so
07:51 - my suggestion to solve this problem is
07:53 - very simple just allow developers to
07:55 - self-report like for example just allow
07:57 - me to send you a screenshot of my sim
07:58 - stats and do the math based is on copy
08:00 - sold if there's a huge discrepancy
08:02 - between the self-reported numbers and
08:04 - the estimates then sure go ahead and dig
08:05 - deeper but most developers are going to
08:07 - be honest so I do not believe that
08:09 - self-reporting with only two tons of
08:10 - fraud so once again if it truly is your
08:12 - intention to not punish the bumpers if
08:15 - the problem with Multi-Device installs
08:16 - is simply privacy laws then this should
08:18 - be a very simple fix by doing the math
08:20 - based on copy sold and allowing
08:22 - developers to self-report their stats
08:24 - using that it wouldn't allow developers
08:25 - like me to sell games on Steam and then
08:27 - allow those people to install the game
08:28 - on any advice they own like for example
08:30 - their PC and also on their steam deck
08:32 - without incurring extra fees and the
08:33 - self-report feature with also some of
08:35 - the Privacy problems instead of trying
08:37 - to detect piracy which is essentially an
08:39 - impossible problem once again just
08:41 - allowed the film port to self-report and
08:42 - do the math based on those numbers and
08:44 - not whatever method you have for the
08:46 - Technic piracy which again currently
08:47 - developers do not trust unity and so far
08:49 - UNT has responded to the privacy
08:51 - concerns with basically just trust them
08:52 - just trust their super magic algorithm
08:54 - whereas if you don't have self-reporting
08:56 - then there's really no trust needed the
08:58 - developer gives you their real numbers
08:59 - and math is based on that also just
09:01 - another simple suggestion apparently
09:03 - yunty personal now requires an internet
09:05 - connection for three days I don't know
09:06 - if this is new if this was already the
09:08 - case or it changed alongside this fee
09:10 - either way I really don't see why this
09:12 - needs to exist I assume it's to prevent
09:14 - some kind of abuse but I really have no
09:16 - idea on what exactly that abuse could be
09:17 - so maybe there's a good reason for it
09:19 - but I generally cannot see it so unless
09:22 - I'm missing something super important my
09:23 - suggestion would simply be just remove
09:25 - this requirement it's a free version
09:27 - this is for hobbies this is for people
09:28 - who are actually trying to learn making
09:30 - small games there's no reason to force
09:32 - them to have an internet connection and
09:34 - my final suggestion is not really mine
09:36 - but it's actually from Frey and several
09:38 - other people basically make the changes
09:40 - only apply to Unity 2024 and Beyond then
09:42 - also other people have expanded upon
09:44 - this and basically asked for a terms of
09:45 - service that is logged to a specific
09:47 - version that way technically Unity would
09:49 - be legally unable to make changes like
09:51 - this after the fact now while I think
09:53 - these changes would be great personally
09:55 - I really don't expect these to happen
09:56 - and the reason is based on the same
09:57 - analysis on why I don't think they want
09:59 - reverse course the entire Point behind
10:01 - this change is to get money from the
10:03 - likes of Pokemon go and gentian impact
10:04 - those games were launched years ago and
10:06 - they continued to live nowadays so if
10:08 - they were to modify the terms to make it
10:10 - so that the new fee is only applicable
10:11 - to Future games they would simply not
10:13 - get money from those games so that is
10:15 - why well I think this change would
10:16 - generally be great I really don't have
10:18 - much hope of it happening finally here's
10:21 - one very simple suggestion this chart
10:23 - over here really has one very
10:24 - nonsensical part and it's really this
10:26 - entire comment over here for ENT
10:28 - personal there is absolutely no reason
10:30 - why anyone would ever pay 20 cents per
10:32 - install the reason is because apparently
10:34 - the elements update instantly the second
10:35 - you change license so basically if you
10:38 - have a game and it has 200 000 installs
10:40 - and has made a hundred ninety thousand
10:42 - dollars then at that point you would
10:43 - just buy ENT Pro which instantly raised
10:45 - the limit to one mill so basically
10:46 - there's absolutely no logical reason why
10:48 - anyone would pay this fee based on this
10:50 - my very simple advice is just get rid of
10:52 - this entire side just add a revenue
10:54 - threshold on the free version pretty
10:56 - much like it was before if you make over
10:58 - a million dollars then you have to
10:59 - switch to Pro that's really it if you do
11:01 - that then you can completely cut down
11:03 - this column and nothing changes I
11:04 - believe that will really help simplify
11:06 - things since there's absolutely no
11:07 - reason why anyone would ever pay this
11:09 - one specific fee and now that I've given
11:11 - my feedback to Unity let me give you the
11:13 - viewer the unity developer my advice on
11:15 - what to do like I said taking the
11:17 - assumption that these changes are not
11:19 - going to reverse the fee is here to stay
11:21 - so with that assumption let's take some
11:22 - time to look at them as I said you can
11:24 - completely ignore the personal side that
11:26 - makes no sense if you get close to this
11:27 - you just get Unity Pro so let's just
11:29 - worry about this column this meltdown
11:31 - threshold now my advice to you is simply
11:33 - do the exact same thing that I did on
11:35 - the very first video on this topic
11:36 - basically just look at this chart
11:38 - analyze these rules carefully and calmly
11:40 - and decide what do you want to do next
11:41 - like I mentioned my own use case my
11:44 - games will never make a million dollars
11:45 - so my decision is simply I won't keep
11:47 - using Unity because for my specific use
11:49 - case I will never pay anything if your
11:52 - use case is also steam pc in the games
11:54 - if so then chances are you will never go
11:57 - over to this limit so you will never
11:58 - have to pay any fee now if your use case
12:00 - are free to play mobile games where you
12:02 - expect to only be able to monetize each
12:04 - user at under a dollar if so then I
12:06 - would definitely highly advise you
12:07 - against using Unity unless you somehow
12:10 - trust them enough to give you a special
12:11 - deal or yet another thing you can do is
12:13 - as many people I point out for some
12:15 - people the numbers don't matter at all
12:17 - for some people they don't care if the
12:19 - numbers are fair or unfair for some
12:21 - people what matters most is trust and
12:23 - they feel that ENT can never be trusted
12:24 - again if that's you then here my advice
12:27 - is you should probably quit Unity unless
12:28 - you feel there's some way they can
12:30 - regain your trust although again if the
12:32 - only way that they could regain your
12:33 - trust is to revert these changes then I
12:35 - really don't think this will happen and
12:37 - now let me also address some very valid
12:38 - points that people directed at me when I
12:40 - said that I won't keep using Unity
12:41 - because the fees do not apply to me most
12:43 - comments were saying something like okay
12:45 - so the fees right now don't affect you
12:46 - but tomorrow they couldn't lower the
12:48 - limit to a low amount which would affect
12:49 - you and my answer to that is yep that
12:51 - could definitely happen they could
12:53 - change the terms tomorrow and change
12:54 - them to something much much worse
12:56 - however personally I see that's really
12:58 - true of everything I'm right here on
13:00 - YouTube which is also a company that is
13:01 - known for changing crazy things that no
13:03 - one wanted technically I could wake up
13:05 - tomorrow and my channel would be
13:06 - completely demonetized or just outright
13:09 - deleted or another example seem could
13:11 - suddenly decide tomorrow to up their
13:12 - rate from 30 to 90 technically that
13:15 - could happen so personally for this
13:17 - argument I really don't find Productive
13:19 - to panic about all the bad things that
13:21 - definitely could happen instead for me I
13:23 - assume a look at the current reality and
13:24 - just adapt to it if tomorrow Unity
13:26 - changed these terms once more then I
13:28 - will once again read the new terms and
13:30 - come to a new decision that's also the
13:31 - exact same reason why personally I don't
13:33 - consider the trust factor in making my
13:35 - decision I've never really relied on
13:37 - trusting or distrusting Unity for me it
13:40 - is merely a tool it is a tool with
13:42 - certain capabilities and of course a
13:43 - certain cost if the capabilities or the
13:46 - cost changes then I will analyze new
13:48 - reality and once again adapt to it at
13:50 - the end of the day this is really your
13:51 - decision so make your decision on what
13:53 - engine you want to use based on whatever
13:55 - criteria you decide like I said in the
13:57 - previous two videos I'm not trying to
13:58 - change anyone's mind whether you stay or
14:00 - quit Unity either way that's fine by me
14:02 - all I can say is I generally wish you
14:05 - the best of luck in your game Dev
14:06 - Journey regardless of what engine you
14:07 - choose to use alright so thanks for
14:09 - watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey okay so here let's analyze what I think will happen next also look at some answers on why this even happened then my advice on some changes that Unity could make and finally my advice to you going forward but first just the quick question in the title will ENT roll back these changes right now A lot of people are wondering if this truly is the platform or if there's a tiny chance for a reversal my quick answer is if you're waiting for a reversal then I would say don't wait if a phone reversal is the absolute only thing that would keep you in unity if so or simply if you film trust is damage Beyond repair then my simple advice is just move on to something else because personally I do not believe a big reversal is coming here are three reasons on why I think that now when I made the second video on this topic which was one day after the announcement and pretty much everything was on fire back then I generally believe there was a potential for a reversal considering the intensity of the backlash but given the recent updates where all they did was clarify what cuts as an insole and basically just to find some exceptions based on that it does seem like a reversal is really not coming at all at best they are willing to do do some compromises like we saw the exception on charity bundles demos and reinstalls but it generally does seem like they are really committed to going down this path basically since then the backlash has continued there's even a Twitter account tracking all these statements from all the various Studios who pretty much have just said they're not going to use int anymore basically the general consensus is there are devs there are in the middle of development and they won't keep using Unity to the end but most of them they feel that this is done irreparable harm and can no longer trust unity and will no longer use it in future projects so basically with that that's another reason why I don't think there will be a reversal basically a lot of people have already made up their minds and they won't quit UNT regardless of what happens so if you were to play Devil's Advocate and look at the Quant hard facts from minty side they basically got two options they can either revert this pricing or they can keep it now if they revert then those people who film this own situation has broken trust Beyond repair those will not return so they've still quit unity and of course by reverting the changes they obviously won't make any revenue from this thing whereas if they keep the new pricing then the have still quite TNT just the same but they do get extra Revenue perhaps the ones that say and pay the fee perhaps it won't be enough to offset the loss of all of these licenses so basically if you play that one's that there's really no benefit on them to go back so that's another reason why I really don't believe there won't be a reversal I think at this point they are really committed to going down this path no matter what and yet another reason is something that they actually themselves say on the various official posts they mentioned how these changes will not affect 90 of customers meaning they only impact the top 10 percent now unt's business is very top heavy they really only make money from a tiny handful of super huge devs those are devs that make things like engine impact and Marvel snap those are the ones that really make the money meaning that looking at all the posts on this Twitter account have gone through pretty much all of them and all I see are Indie devs the reality is unity's customers aren't really Indies like you or me it's the developers making the mega hits so in terms of backlash against these changes those aren't really the only ones that matter and I cannot find any public statements from those big developers although I assume there are some serious discussions happening behind all zores again at this point it really goes back to Simple Math if all of these developers quit but the likes of Marvel snap stays and happily pays the fee if so then it can actually be a net positive for them in terms of shortterm profits so again if you're hoping for a phone reversal I don't believe it won't happen now if you're curious as to why this fee even came to be why this idea was even thought of in the first place there's a great Twitter thread with tons and tons of infos by someone who was there in the very early stages of this discussion which apparently happened one year ago now I highly encourage you to read this home thread if you want to get an inside look on why all this happened basically the core idea is that UNT spends a ton of money making the engine relevant supporting tons of unique platforms that is certainly very expensive and for the most part UNT has not made a profit I believe they only went into the green for these last two quarters and with interest rates rising and investment dollars pretty much drying up they desperately need more Revenue they can't really go back in the red just like it says here 80 of users don't pay anything at all basically it's the ads business that runs the engine now most people see UNT as a game engine that does ads on the side but the business reality is actually on the exact opposite Unity is really in that company with an engine on the side so they desperately need to get more money but ads are based on how many games people play and how much advertisers pay meaning they don't have much control over that what they can directly control is indeed get more revenue from the engine side of the business by introducing as a ref share or just like we saw a per game fee so this is yet another reason why it really does not seem that they are unlikely to go back on this they desperately need to make the company profitable in any way now if they are truly committed to going down this path if a complete reversal is absolutely not in the cards then here are my suggestions for how to make pretty much the best of a bad situation also before I mention my suggestions here is the same disclaimer that I made in my very first video I am a steam pc solo Indie Dev so my suggestions are coming from that one very specific point of view I am not a mobile expert I am not a freetoplay expert so I do hope that Unity won't listen to my suggestions but I also hope that they won't consult experts in all the other areas of game development when deciding what specific changes to implement the industry tree is huge and changes that might be good for one sector might be terrible for another one Unity have mentioned how the spirit of this program is really for them to succeed when developers succeed they have mentioned how it's not their intention to bankrupt anyone but right now just based on these rules just based on this chart it is technically possible for a developer to go bankrupt basically if your Revenue per user is under the fee amount then you're pretty much on the path to bankruptcy or simply just the case that they're talking about revenue and not profit so if your profit margins are so small that you cannot afford the fee then once again you go down to bankruptcy back to this Twitter thread there's actually a nice graph over here with some nice math and this personally shows the problem with the Pern sound model here you can see how some examples of fee is actually pretty fair for example up here Pokemon go they would pay literally 0.1 percent their revenue I think anyone would call 0.1 percent to be perfectly reasonable and also we can see that it is much better when compared to a flight Revenue share model so for Pokemon go making 60k under the parent selfie they would pay 60 bucks whereas under unreal is five percent they would pay three grand so definitely a much better deal however while the view works fine for this one case which is heavily monetizing its users it absolutely completely fails on games like for example over here Among Us in this case the FIFA Among Us would be a whopping 55 or for an even worse result here is a hyper casual game called Bridge race and for this one the fee would actually be 180 now that is obviously completely insane if your fee is higher than your Revenue then you can obviously only end in bankruptcy and over here the following comments will point out exactly the same problem and basically the proposed solution is it would be individually negotiated with UNT so basically as things sent right now basically you would have to trust their intentions you would have to trust that they generally do not wish the bankrupt developers and you would also need to trust that if this scenario were to happen they would actually make an exception and help you not go bankrupt but right now obviously trust is something that UNT lacks so here's my very simple feedback on this issue if the intention is genuinely to merely make money when developers also make money and not bankrupt them if that truly and genuinely is the intention behind this fee then I believe believe that the rules should clearly reflect that meaning my suggestion would be just at a simple Revenue cap something like three percent or five percent so the fee would either be the parent selfie or the revenue royalty whichever one is most so in this example on Pokemon go would pay 60 bucks and then Among Us would pay four bucks again if the goal is indeed to only succeed when developers succeed then I believe that this very simple rule would make that call a reality while keeping developers safe from these insane edge cases now for some more feedback my suggestion regarding the issues with insounds on different devices again in Tia said it is not in the spirit that this program to overcharge the bumpers that's why they want back the fee on green songs and demos but they still confirm that it sounds on different devices those will be charged and the reason for that is because they don't want to track identity across devices that would pretty much break a ton of privacy laws I can understand how it's secondly impossible to track this over multiple devices without breaking those laws so my suggestion to solve this problem is very simple just allow developers to selfreport like for example just allow me to send you a screenshot of my sim stats and do the math based is on copy sold if there's a huge discrepancy between the selfreported numbers and the estimates then sure go ahead and dig deeper but most developers are going to be honest so I do not believe that selfreporting with only two tons of fraud so once again if it truly is your intention to not punish the bumpers if the problem with MultiDevice installs is simply privacy laws then this should be a very simple fix by doing the math based on copy sold and allowing developers to selfreport their stats using that it wouldn't allow developers like me to sell games on Steam and then allow those people to install the game on any advice they own like for example their PC and also on their steam deck without incurring extra fees and the selfreport feature with also some of the Privacy problems instead of trying to detect piracy which is essentially an impossible problem once again just allowed the film port to selfreport and do the math based on those numbers and not whatever method you have for the Technic piracy which again currently developers do not trust unity and so far UNT has responded to the privacy concerns with basically just trust them just trust their super magic algorithm whereas if you don't have selfreporting then there's really no trust needed the developer gives you their real numbers and math is based on that also just another simple suggestion apparently yunty personal now requires an internet connection for three days I don't know if this is new if this was already the case or it changed alongside this fee either way I really don't see why this needs to exist I assume it's to prevent some kind of abuse but I really have no idea on what exactly that abuse could be so maybe there's a good reason for it but I generally cannot see it so unless I'm missing something super important my suggestion would simply be just remove this requirement it's a free version this is for hobbies this is for people who are actually trying to learn making small games there's no reason to force them to have an internet connection and my final suggestion is not really mine but it's actually from Frey and several other people basically make the changes only apply to Unity 2024 and Beyond then also other people have expanded upon this and basically asked for a terms of service that is logged to a specific version that way technically Unity would be legally unable to make changes like this after the fact now while I think these changes would be great personally I really don't expect these to happen and the reason is based on the same analysis on why I don't think they want reverse course the entire Point behind this change is to get money from the likes of Pokemon go and gentian impact those games were launched years ago and they continued to live nowadays so if they were to modify the terms to make it so that the new fee is only applicable to Future games they would simply not get money from those games so that is why well I think this change would generally be great I really don't have much hope of it happening finally here's one very simple suggestion this chart over here really has one very nonsensical part and it's really this entire comment over here for ENT personal there is absolutely no reason why anyone would ever pay 20 cents per install the reason is because apparently the elements update instantly the second you change license so basically if you have a game and it has 200 000 installs and has made a hundred ninety thousand dollars then at that point you would just buy ENT Pro which instantly raised the limit to one mill so basically there's absolutely no logical reason why anyone would pay this fee based on this my very simple advice is just get rid of this entire side just add a revenue threshold on the free version pretty much like it was before if you make over a million dollars then you have to switch to Pro that's really it if you do that then you can completely cut down this column and nothing changes I believe that will really help simplify things since there's absolutely no reason why anyone would ever pay this one specific fee and now that I've given my feedback to Unity let me give you the viewer the unity developer my advice on what to do like I said taking the assumption that these changes are not going to reverse the fee is here to stay so with that assumption let's take some time to look at them as I said you can completely ignore the personal side that makes no sense if you get close to this you just get Unity Pro so let's just worry about this column this meltdown threshold now my advice to you is simply do the exact same thing that I did on the very first video on this topic basically just look at this chart analyze these rules carefully and calmly and decide what do you want to do next like I mentioned my own use case my games will never make a million dollars so my decision is simply I won't keep using Unity because for my specific use case I will never pay anything if your use case is also steam pc in the games if so then chances are you will never go over to this limit so you will never have to pay any fee now if your use case are free to play mobile games where you expect to only be able to monetize each user at under a dollar if so then I would definitely highly advise you against using Unity unless you somehow trust them enough to give you a special deal or yet another thing you can do is as many people I point out for some people the numbers don't matter at all for some people they don't care if the numbers are fair or unfair for some people what matters most is trust and they feel that ENT can never be trusted again if that's you then here my advice is you should probably quit Unity unless you feel there's some way they can regain your trust although again if the only way that they could regain your trust is to revert these changes then I really don't think this will happen and now let me also address some very valid points that people directed at me when I said that I won't keep using Unity because the fees do not apply to me most comments were saying something like okay so the fees right now don't affect you but tomorrow they couldn't lower the limit to a low amount which would affect you and my answer to that is yep that could definitely happen they could change the terms tomorrow and change them to something much much worse however personally I see that's really true of everything I'm right here on YouTube which is also a company that is known for changing crazy things that no one wanted technically I could wake up tomorrow and my channel would be completely demonetized or just outright deleted or another example seem could suddenly decide tomorrow to up their rate from 30 to 90 technically that could happen so personally for this argument I really don't find Productive to panic about all the bad things that definitely could happen instead for me I assume a look at the current reality and just adapt to it if tomorrow Unity changed these terms once more then I will once again read the new terms and come to a new decision that's also the exact same reason why personally I don't consider the trust factor in making my decision I've never really relied on trusting or distrusting Unity for me it is merely a tool it is a tool with certain capabilities and of course a certain cost if the capabilities or the cost changes then I will analyze new reality and once again adapt to it at the end of the day this is really your decision so make your decision on what engine you want to use based on whatever criteria you decide like I said in the previous two videos I'm not trying to change anyone's mind whether you stay or quit Unity either way that's fine by me all I can say is I generally wish you the best of luck in your game Dev Journey regardless of what engine you choose to use alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
