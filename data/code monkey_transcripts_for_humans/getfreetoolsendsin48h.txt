00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and right now there's a sale with tons
00:04 - of interesting tools and assets on a
00:06 - nice discount and on top of that there's
00:08 - three tools you can get commonly for
00:09 - free all you need to do is just add them
00:11 - to your cart and apply the coupon tombox
00:13 - and the total won't be free this video's
00:15 - picture on sponsor is seriesgamejobs.com
00:17 - are you looking for unity work find out
00:20 - hundreds of companies seeking unity devs
00:21 - right now sign up for the free weekly
00:24 - email digest and get access to the
00:25 - search tool built specifically for unity
00:27 - and unreal jobs so as i was saying
00:29 - there's three tools you can get commonly
00:31 - for free the first one is called love
00:33 - hate it's a personality simulator so
00:36 - this would be perfect if you're working
00:38 - on an rpg or really any game with either
00:40 - characters or factions you define
00:43 - personality traits and how they affect
00:44 - the final mood either positive or
00:46 - negative it's got tons of five star
00:48 - reviews so if you need this kind of
00:50 - system then this one seems great the
00:52 - next free tool is a touch gestures tool
00:55 - usually when people ask me in the
00:57 - comments for how they can handle swipes
00:59 - drags and all kinds of gestures usually
01:02 - my answer is that it's really best to
01:03 - use some pre-made tool instead of trying
01:05 - to build it yourself so this is a great
01:07 - one
01:08 - features all of the standard ones you
01:10 - can think of so you've got zoom rotate
01:12 - pan tap swipe and tons more
01:15 - also includes a shape and image
01:16 - recognition which is pretty interesting
01:19 - and it even includes on-screen touch
01:20 - buttons
01:21 - so really like i said you're probably
01:23 - better off using a proper tool instead
01:25 - of building it yourself and here's a
01:27 - great one and again it's completely free
01:28 - so definitely get this one right away if
01:30 - you have any interest in mobile games
01:32 - and the final free tool is resize pro
01:35 - this is a texture resize tool it takes
01:37 - any texture you have in any format and
01:40 - just resizes it
01:41 - so if you have some mega textures that
01:43 - you use in development but you want some
01:44 - smaller versions for mobile then maybe
01:46 - this can help generate all those
01:48 - textures and it also works during
01:50 - runtime so for example if you take a
01:53 - screenshot while playing the game and
01:54 - you want to show it in game kind of like
01:56 - how i showed in the save file screenshot
01:58 - video you could take a screenshot and
02:00 - then use this tool to make it smaller
02:01 - and make that save file much more
02:03 - compressed
02:04 - so it's a pre-focused tool and it does
02:06 - exactly what you expect now this free
02:08 - giveaway is ending pretty soon it ends
02:10 - in just three days so go ahead and get
02:12 - it as quickly as possible you just add
02:14 - them to your cart then apply the coupon
02:15 - tombox and after that the total will be
02:17 - free so beyond these free tools there's
02:20 - a bunch more assets on a 50 discount
02:23 - like for example up here you've got a
02:24 - download system and a quest machine both
02:26 - of these are very high rated assets they
02:29 - do exactly what you expect so this one
02:31 - helps you handle dialogues so any
02:33 - communication between any characters and
02:35 - this one helps you handle quests so set
02:37 - up the goals rewards keep a log and so
02:39 - on then if you're using opsif or ufps
02:42 - you've got a bunch of plugins then a
02:43 - whole bunch of realistic characters
02:45 - then down here there's a nice system for
02:47 - some volumetric clouds and then also a
02:50 - super fast line renderer so if your game
02:51 - uses lots of lines for drawing or maybe
02:53 - some effects or something like that this
02:55 - could be a great addition and then down
02:57 - here there's a bunch more really
02:58 - interesting tools for example you've got
03:00 - the curved one which i actually did a
03:02 - full review on this asset you can go

03:06 - really interesting effect it really

03:11 - assault shader effect then a nice
03:13 - wireframe shader for a really
03:15 - interesting look and a bunch of these
