00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's talk about the number one
00:04 - most important skill you need if you
00:05 - want to be a successful indie game
00:07 - developer with this skill you have a
00:09 - chance to find success and without it
00:11 - you are guaranteed to fail now i don't
00:13 - like videos where they tease the answer
00:14 - to keep you watching until the end so
00:16 - here it is the number one skill is
00:17 - marketing but do keep watching to know
00:20 - why that is the most important skill and
00:22 - in this video i'll also give you some
00:23 - helpful links on how you can start
00:25 - learning indie game marketing as well as
00:27 - some metrics for you to track and a
00:29 - checklist to follow to have the best
00:30 - chance of finding success with your
00:32 - games now if you're a game developer you
00:34 - might be upset to hear that marketing is
00:36 - the most important skill you might be
00:38 - thinking oh i really just want to make
00:40 - games i don't like working on marketing
00:42 - and i get that but regardless of how you
00:45 - feel about it this really is the most
00:47 - important skill nowadays we live in what
00:49 - is called an attention economy attention
00:51 - is really the most valuable resource
00:53 - that is why the going with platforms
00:55 - like youtube and facebook their goal is
00:57 - to keep you on the side for as long as
00:58 - possible it's because your attention has
01:00 - value it's also why a company like
01:03 - netflix says their biggest competitor is
01:05 - not movie studios but rather games like
01:06 - fortnite there's a million things
01:08 - competing for your attention and more
01:10 - importantly for the attention of your
01:11 - players marketing is simply the study of
01:14 - attention and how to get it that is why
01:16 - it's an extremely important skill that
01:17 - you absolutely need to learn now let me
01:19 - also clarify what i mean by most
01:21 - important here i'm talking in the
01:23 - context of wanting to become a
01:25 - professional indie game developer
01:27 - meaning that you want to make a living
01:28 - from making games you want to make games
01:30 - that sell internet profits so you can
01:32 - keep making more games and keep this as
01:34 - your job
01:35 - but on the other hand if your goal is to
01:37 - make games simply as a hobby just for
01:39 - fun
01:40 - then for that marketing is much less
01:42 - important but it's still pretty
01:43 - important since even if you're doing it
01:45 - as a hobby i'm guessing you still want
01:47 - people to play your games so regardless
01:49 - of your goal you're still going to need
01:50 - to attract the dungeon and as soon as
01:52 - some people hear that they should do
01:54 - marketing some people go straight into
01:55 - the default answer which is oh i don't
01:57 - worry about it a good game just sells
01:59 - itself so let me tell you right away
02:01 - that is absolutely not true the quality
02:04 - bar is really high nowadays being good
02:06 - is not good enough having a good game is
02:09 - the absolute bare minimum requirement
02:11 - there are tons of games coming out that
02:12 - are really good but without marketing
02:14 - then people simply don't know about them
02:16 - so they never sell so a great game that
02:18 - no knows about will not sell itself if
02:21 - you are a regular on this channel then
02:22 - you know i do a top 10 list of the best
02:25 - new games released every month fighting
02:27 - games for that list is pretty easy
02:29 - there's tons of awesome new games every
02:31 - single month the tricky part is really
02:33 - cutting it down to just 10
02:35 - and every time i make one of those
02:36 - videos i see tons of games that look
02:38 - really cool but have almost no sales
02:41 - for example look at this game that came
02:42 - out a few months ago it looks like a
02:44 - very well made retro shooter it's got a
02:47 - nice art style lots of effects and it's
02:49 - a relatively popular genre and the
02:51 - reviews it received are indeed positive
02:54 - so this looks like a great game
02:56 - but based on the reviews and using the
02:58 - box and lighter method which means you
03:00 - multiply the reviews by between 20 and
03:01 - 70 so around 40. with 50 reviews we can
03:05 - assume this game sold around 2 000
03:06 - copies which at this price point of 10
03:09 - means only about 10k gross revenue which
03:12 - after seems cut any refunds or
03:14 - chargebacks and taxes after all of that
03:17 - it might be just about ak net
03:19 - now maybe if the developer lives in a
03:21 - place with a really low cost of living
03:23 - or maybe if this game was made insanely
03:26 - fast in some like under 3 months in that
03:28 - case maybe it's not such a horrible
03:30 - number but regardless of that based on
03:32 - the quality of the game you would
03:33 - definitely assume a better result so the
03:35 - question is why did this one not find
03:37 - success i'm going to mention some
03:39 - metrics you can track in a bit the main
03:41 - ones being followers and wishlists
03:43 - if you go to steam to be you can see
03:45 - that this game had just 300 followers
03:47 - before release so probably only around a
03:50 - thousand wishlists
03:51 - that means very few people knew about
03:53 - the game even fewer were notified when
03:55 - the game was released and even fewer
03:57 - then picked it up which in turn means it
03:59 - was buried on steam under thousands of
04:01 - other games by the way if you're the
04:03 - developer of this game please don't take
04:04 - this the wrong way i'm not saying the
04:06 - game is banned quite the opposite from
04:08 - looking at the trailer in the reviews it
04:10 - seems like a great game and i believe
04:11 - with some good marketing it would have
04:13 - sold much much better
04:14 - and i didn't just cherry pick one
04:16 - specific game to make my point you can
04:18 - go browse the steam new releasing list
04:20 - and see for yourself just how many games
04:22 - look great but don't even have 50
04:24 - reviews and just like i mentioned in
04:26 - those top 10 new releases videos the
04:28 - reason why i do those is so i can keep
04:30 - up to date with what's coming out and
04:32 - see what is finding success
04:34 - so researching those games and doing
04:35 - those videos is a way for me personally
04:37 - to keep studying and learning about
04:39 - marketing so that my future games have a
04:41 - better chance to find success
04:42 - also another example one of the reasons
04:44 - why i started this channel was
04:46 - specifically to tackle this problem i
04:48 - was studying steam more and more and i
04:50 - learned that discoverability was really
04:51 - only getting harder and harder
04:53 - if i wanted to find success with my
04:55 - games i could not rely on steam finding
04:57 - the players for me
04:59 - steam will only help you sell your game
05:01 - if you can prove that your game can sell
05:03 - meaning that if you don't get that
05:04 - initial amount of sales then your game
05:06 - will simply be lost in a sea of
05:08 - thousands of other games but if you do
05:10 - make that initial push then c will do
05:12 - the rest if you take the effort to do
05:14 - some marketing and you get some people
05:16 - excited for your game and get them to
05:18 - pick it up on day one if you do that the
05:20 - sim algorithm will see your game is
05:22 - getting sales which in turn will promote
05:23 - it to more and more people leading to
05:25 - more and more sales so one of the
05:27 - reasons why i started this channel was
05:28 - for marketing reasons so that i could
05:30 - gather an audience by sharing my
05:32 - knowledge with some useful videos then
05:34 - hopefully that audience would pick up my
05:35 - games whenever i release them and by
05:37 - selling a bunch of copies on day one
05:39 - that would signal to the steam algorithm
05:41 - to push the game and have a successful
05:42 - launch that was my original plan however
05:45 - i must say if you're thinking of doing
05:46 - the exact same thing i would caution you
05:48 - to think about what type of audience
05:50 - you're trying to attract for me i enjoy
05:53 - learning and teaching things so i made a
05:55 - tutorial channel but it turns out that a
05:57 - game dev audience is very different from
05:59 - a game playing audience i initially
06:01 - assumed that a lot of people would
06:02 - follow my tutorials and be curious to
06:04 - know where the knowledge came from so
06:06 - they would then pick up my games to see
06:08 - them i have a bundle on the code monkey
06:10 - website but in almost 4 years and over
06:13 - 20 million views it's only sold maybe
06:14 - 500 copies and now i definitely
06:17 - understand that personally i'm more of a
06:19 - game dev than a game player and i
06:20 - definitely find that i like the time to
06:22 - actually play games so all of that to
06:24 - say be intentional about what type of
06:26 - audience you want to attract
06:28 - there are several people doing some more
06:30 - developed content and that type does
06:32 - seem to translate into sales for example
06:34 - on the top you have denny his devlogs
06:37 - are extremely entertaining they
06:38 - definitely appeal to a more general game
06:40 - playing audience and as such all these
06:42 - games have been massive hits another
06:44 - example is thin matrix he gathered an
06:46 - audience over several years making
06:48 - devlogs and when the game came out it
06:50 - sold tons of copies and then steam
06:52 - pushed it to more and more people making
06:53 - it a massive success so using youtube is
06:56 - absolutely an excellent way to do it
06:58 - just make sure you target the right
06:59 - audience with regards to how to learn
07:02 - indie game marketing here are some very
07:03 - harmful links first of all you have the
07:05 - clark tank this was a show made by ryan
07:08 - clark who runs a very successful indie
07:10 - game company that made huge hits they
07:13 - made games like crypt of the necrodancer
07:15 - and cadence of hyrule
07:16 - the clark tank was a weekly show where
07:18 - he would go through the steam charts and
07:20 - analyze why each game was doing well he
07:23 - doesn't do it anymore but you can still
07:24 - go watch the old episodes there's tons
07:26 - of excellent info there and he also made
07:28 - possibly one of the best tanks of all
07:30 - time on how to consistently make
07:32 - profitable indie games marketing is an
07:34 - extremely important part of that process
07:36 - and an excellent companion video all
07:38 - about how to analyze hooks
07:40 - i would highly highly encourage you to
07:42 - watch that video and study it marketing
07:44 - becomes much much easier if your game
07:46 - idea has a good hook
07:47 - on the other hand if your game has no
07:49 - hook or a generic hook like it's just
07:52 - another generic 2d pixel platformer in
07:55 - that case marketing becomes even more
07:56 - difficult i can also highly recommend
07:59 - the newsletter game discover co it's a
08:01 - weekly newsletter all about indie game
08:03 - marketing analyzing why some games find
08:05 - success and tons of stats on how indie
08:07 - games are selling
08:09 - another great one for marketing is chris
08:11 - tsukowski he's got a vlog with tons of
08:13 - useful articles and even some youtube
08:15 - videos where he analyzes various store
08:17 - pages
08:18 - i also made some videos myself a while
08:20 - ago on some checklists of what you
08:22 - should do before and after launching on
08:23 - scene
08:24 - lots of the things on that checklist are
08:26 - all about marketing so you can see just
08:28 - how important it is so i would encourage
08:30 - you to study all of those sources if you
08:32 - do you won't be much better off than
08:34 - most indie devs and greatly greatly
08:36 - increase your chances of finding success
08:38 - now as to how you actually do it there
08:41 - are many many ways to do marketing the
08:43 - most basic prerequisite is simply having
08:45 - a public steam page the most impactful
08:47 - thing in marketing is simply time the
08:50 - quicker you get your steam page up and
08:51 - running the more time you have to gather
08:53 - wishlists and wishlists build up over
08:55 - time so the longer you have your page
08:57 - receiving wishlist the better
08:59 - then like i mentioned a while ago one of
09:00 - the main ones is youtube if you have the
09:03 - right kind of personality you can
09:04 - attempt the danny style with lots of
09:06 - funny clips and some extreme editing as
09:09 - for me i definitely do not have that
09:10 - kind of personality so that type of
09:12 - content would definitely not work for me
09:14 - but you can also do some more chill dev
09:16 - vlogs i made a video quite a while ago
09:18 - covering a bunch of devlogs like i
09:20 - mentioned themed matrix is a good one
09:23 - you also have flow studio that recently
09:25 - released a successful game
09:27 - you have lumber mill and devdog and many
09:29 - more feel free to check those out to see
09:31 - what style best fits you and your game
09:34 - also it doesn't have to be just develops
09:36 - maybe if you have a sandbox game you
09:39 - could make a channel with some funny
09:40 - clips or some weird unexpected things
09:42 - that happen in your game remember that
09:44 - the goal is attention so do whatever you
09:46 - can do that brings in the most intention
09:48 - another place you can do some marketing
09:50 - would be on twitter although in terms of
09:52 - results i believe this one is quite
09:54 - limited
09:54 - but still you should be making some
09:56 - gifts and perhaps one of them will go
09:58 - viral
09:59 - then as you're making those gifts you
10:00 - can also post them on imager
10:03 - i think this one also has kind of lost
10:04 - its power nowadays but you might get
10:06 - lucky and make it go viral then of
10:08 - course you have reddit depending on what
10:11 - game you're making you can find a
10:12 - subreddit specific for the audience
10:14 - you're looking for
10:16 - for example there's a tycoon subreddit
10:18 - there's one for turn-based strategy or
10:20 - maybe you can even post in subreddits of
10:22 - other popular games similar to yours
10:25 - but do be careful with red rules some
10:27 - silver edits are very strict about
10:29 - self-promotion
10:30 - there's also tick tock personally i have
10:33 - not explored this one yet i'm not
10:34 - familiar with it but i did hear some
10:36 - indies are finding quite a lot of
10:38 - success
10:38 - then a tried and true method you have a
10:41 - mailing list just have a sign up form on
10:43 - your website mention it whenever you
10:45 - mention your game and keep growing that
10:47 - list
10:48 - usually people who sign up to a mailing
10:49 - list are already pre-interested so
10:51 - growing this one is very difficult but
10:53 - very powerful another technique a lot of
10:55 - people have used successfully is making
10:57 - a free prologue
10:59 - so kind of like making a free demo if
11:01 - you design the demo correctly and it
11:03 - leaves people wanting more then you will
11:05 - likely gather a nice amount of wishlist
11:07 - and related to that free prologue
11:09 - something more recent are the steam
11:10 - festivals i believe they have some rules
11:13 - on when you can submit but if you can
11:15 - definitely take advantage of it for
11:17 - example the game i mentioned a while ago
11:19 - lens island by floyd studio they
11:21 - benefited massively from participating
11:23 - in this team festival
11:24 - it's great for gathering tons and tons
11:26 - of wishlists even if those then convert
11:28 - less than the organic questions and of
11:30 - course you also have paid marketing this
11:32 - one will naturally depend on the funds
11:34 - you have available as well as the price
11:36 - of your game
11:38 - if you have a very cheap five dollar
11:40 - game it's pretty difficult to make paid
11:41 - marketing work
11:42 - but if your game is 15 or 20 dollars
11:45 - then at that point it becomes much more
11:47 - doable
11:48 - so those are just a bunch of ways you
11:49 - can do some marketing you might be
11:51 - thinking to yourself okay that sounds
11:53 - good but it's way too much work so again
11:55 - let me remind you that the alternative
11:57 - to doing no marketing is getting no
11:59 - sales
12:00 - so either you put in the work or you
12:02 - have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a
12:04 - reality whether you like it or not
12:06 - as for metrics specifically on steam
12:09 - there's some you should track like i've
12:11 - already mentioned the most important one
12:12 - is wishlists wishlists are one of the
12:15 - ways that the steam algorithm learns
12:16 - that your game is popular the more wish
12:19 - list you have at launch the more steam
12:20 - will promote your game and everyone who
12:22 - wish list will receive a notification
12:24 - when your game launches
12:26 - then the more those wishlists convert
12:28 - the more steam promotes your game
12:29 - further and further another one related
12:31 - to it are followers these are people who
12:34 - click on the follow button on your store
12:35 - page it means they will receive
12:37 - notifications of any announcements you
12:39 - post
12:40 - so followers are kind of like super
12:42 - wishlists
12:43 - as for specific numbers naturally higher
12:45 - is better you should aim for at the very
12:48 - least having around 1500 followers and 5
12:50 - 000 wishlists if you've been working on
12:53 - your game for many years and you
12:54 - generally believe in its quality and
12:56 - you're under that number in that case i
12:58 - would honestly delay the launch and
13:00 - focus hard on marketing until you
13:01 - achieve those you only get one launch
13:03 - it's nearly impossible to come back
13:05 - after a bad one there were some reports
13:07 - although i don't think they've been
13:09 - confirmed that seam has some sort of bar
13:11 - at around 10 000 wish lists meaning that
13:14 - if you get that much you will
13:15 - automatically get much more visibility
13:16 - on the lunch
13:18 - again not sure if that's a fact or just
13:20 - a rumor but regardless more is better so
13:22 - yes the number one most important skill
13:24 - if you want to be successful in the game
13:26 - developer is indeed marketing regardless
13:29 - of how you feel about that it is simply
13:30 - the reality if you refuse to do it then
13:33 - your game will most likely be a flop so
13:35 - do work hard to make your game as best
13:37 - as it can be but also work hard to
13:39 - actually tell lots of people about it
13:41 - this one is a really important topic so
13:43 - i'm really glad i made this video i'm
13:45 - happy you made it to the end and i
13:47 - really really hope this information
13:49 - helps you make your game a huge success
13:51 - now go ahead and hit the like button so
13:53 - more people can find this video and help
13:55 - those people not waste their time by
13:56 - ignoring marketing alright thank you for
13:58 - watching and i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's talk about the number one most important skill you need if you want to be a successful indie game developer with this skill you have a chance to find success and without it you are guaranteed to fail now i don't like videos where they tease the answer to keep you watching until the end so here it is the number one skill is marketing but do keep watching to know why that is the most important skill and in this video i'll also give you some helpful links on how you can start learning indie game marketing as well as some metrics for you to track and a checklist to follow to have the best chance of finding success with your games now if you're a game developer you might be upset to hear that marketing is the most important skill you might be thinking oh i really just want to make games i don't like working on marketing and i get that but regardless of how you feel about it this really is the most important skill nowadays we live in what is called an attention economy attention is really the most valuable resource that is why the going with platforms like youtube and facebook their goal is to keep you on the side for as long as possible it's because your attention has value it's also why a company like netflix says their biggest competitor is not movie studios but rather games like fortnite there's a million things competing for your attention and more importantly for the attention of your players marketing is simply the study of attention and how to get it that is why it's an extremely important skill that you absolutely need to learn now let me also clarify what i mean by most important here i'm talking in the context of wanting to become a professional indie game developer meaning that you want to make a living from making games you want to make games that sell internet profits so you can keep making more games and keep this as your job but on the other hand if your goal is to make games simply as a hobby just for fun then for that marketing is much less important but it's still pretty important since even if you're doing it as a hobby i'm guessing you still want people to play your games so regardless of your goal you're still going to need to attract the dungeon and as soon as some people hear that they should do marketing some people go straight into the default answer which is oh i don't worry about it a good game just sells itself so let me tell you right away that is absolutely not true the quality bar is really high nowadays being good is not good enough having a good game is the absolute bare minimum requirement there are tons of games coming out that are really good but without marketing then people simply don't know about them so they never sell so a great game that no knows about will not sell itself if you are a regular on this channel then you know i do a top 10 list of the best new games released every month fighting games for that list is pretty easy there's tons of awesome new games every single month the tricky part is really cutting it down to just 10 and every time i make one of those videos i see tons of games that look really cool but have almost no sales for example look at this game that came out a few months ago it looks like a very well made retro shooter it's got a nice art style lots of effects and it's a relatively popular genre and the reviews it received are indeed positive so this looks like a great game but based on the reviews and using the box and lighter method which means you multiply the reviews by between 20 and 70 so around 40. with 50 reviews we can assume this game sold around 2 000 copies which at this price point of 10 means only about 10k gross revenue which after seems cut any refunds or chargebacks and taxes after all of that it might be just about ak net now maybe if the developer lives in a place with a really low cost of living or maybe if this game was made insanely fast in some like under 3 months in that case maybe it's not such a horrible number but regardless of that based on the quality of the game you would definitely assume a better result so the question is why did this one not find success i'm going to mention some metrics you can track in a bit the main ones being followers and wishlists if you go to steam to be you can see that this game had just 300 followers before release so probably only around a thousand wishlists that means very few people knew about the game even fewer were notified when the game was released and even fewer then picked it up which in turn means it was buried on steam under thousands of other games by the way if you're the developer of this game please don't take this the wrong way i'm not saying the game is banned quite the opposite from looking at the trailer in the reviews it seems like a great game and i believe with some good marketing it would have sold much much better and i didn't just cherry pick one specific game to make my point you can go browse the steam new releasing list and see for yourself just how many games look great but don't even have 50 reviews and just like i mentioned in those top 10 new releases videos the reason why i do those is so i can keep up to date with what's coming out and see what is finding success so researching those games and doing those videos is a way for me personally to keep studying and learning about marketing so that my future games have a better chance to find success also another example one of the reasons why i started this channel was specifically to tackle this problem i was studying steam more and more and i learned that discoverability was really only getting harder and harder if i wanted to find success with my games i could not rely on steam finding the players for me steam will only help you sell your game if you can prove that your game can sell meaning that if you don't get that initial amount of sales then your game will simply be lost in a sea of thousands of other games but if you do make that initial push then c will do the rest if you take the effort to do some marketing and you get some people excited for your game and get them to pick it up on day one if you do that the sim algorithm will see your game is getting sales which in turn will promote it to more and more people leading to more and more sales so one of the reasons why i started this channel was for marketing reasons so that i could gather an audience by sharing my knowledge with some useful videos then hopefully that audience would pick up my games whenever i release them and by selling a bunch of copies on day one that would signal to the steam algorithm to push the game and have a successful launch that was my original plan however i must say if you're thinking of doing the exact same thing i would caution you to think about what type of audience you're trying to attract for me i enjoy learning and teaching things so i made a tutorial channel but it turns out that a game dev audience is very different from a game playing audience i initially assumed that a lot of people would follow my tutorials and be curious to know where the knowledge came from so they would then pick up my games to see them i have a bundle on the code monkey website but in almost 4 years and over 20 million views it's only sold maybe 500 copies and now i definitely understand that personally i'm more of a game dev than a game player and i definitely find that i like the time to actually play games so all of that to say be intentional about what type of audience you want to attract there are several people doing some more developed content and that type does seem to translate into sales for example on the top you have denny his devlogs are extremely entertaining they definitely appeal to a more general game playing audience and as such all these games have been massive hits another example is thin matrix he gathered an audience over several years making devlogs and when the game came out it sold tons of copies and then steam pushed it to more and more people making it a massive success so using youtube is absolutely an excellent way to do it just make sure you target the right audience with regards to how to learn indie game marketing here are some very harmful links first of all you have the clark tank this was a show made by ryan clark who runs a very successful indie game company that made huge hits they made games like crypt of the necrodancer and cadence of hyrule the clark tank was a weekly show where he would go through the steam charts and analyze why each game was doing well he doesn't do it anymore but you can still go watch the old episodes there's tons of excellent info there and he also made possibly one of the best tanks of all time on how to consistently make profitable indie games marketing is an extremely important part of that process and an excellent companion video all about how to analyze hooks i would highly highly encourage you to watch that video and study it marketing becomes much much easier if your game idea has a good hook on the other hand if your game has no hook or a generic hook like it's just another generic 2d pixel platformer in that case marketing becomes even more difficult i can also highly recommend the newsletter game discover co it's a weekly newsletter all about indie game marketing analyzing why some games find success and tons of stats on how indie games are selling another great one for marketing is chris tsukowski he's got a vlog with tons of useful articles and even some youtube videos where he analyzes various store pages i also made some videos myself a while ago on some checklists of what you should do before and after launching on scene lots of the things on that checklist are all about marketing so you can see just how important it is so i would encourage you to study all of those sources if you do you won't be much better off than most indie devs and greatly greatly increase your chances of finding success now as to how you actually do it there are many many ways to do marketing the most basic prerequisite is simply having a public steam page the most impactful thing in marketing is simply time the quicker you get your steam page up and running the more time you have to gather wishlists and wishlists build up over time so the longer you have your page receiving wishlist the better then like i mentioned a while ago one of the main ones is youtube if you have the right kind of personality you can attempt the danny style with lots of funny clips and some extreme editing as for me i definitely do not have that kind of personality so that type of content would definitely not work for me but you can also do some more chill dev vlogs i made a video quite a while ago covering a bunch of devlogs like i mentioned themed matrix is a good one you also have flow studio that recently released a successful game you have lumber mill and devdog and many more feel free to check those out to see what style best fits you and your game also it doesn't have to be just develops maybe if you have a sandbox game you could make a channel with some funny clips or some weird unexpected things that happen in your game remember that the goal is attention so do whatever you can do that brings in the most intention another place you can do some marketing would be on twitter although in terms of results i believe this one is quite limited but still you should be making some gifts and perhaps one of them will go viral then as you're making those gifts you can also post them on imager i think this one also has kind of lost its power nowadays but you might get lucky and make it go viral then of course you have reddit depending on what game you're making you can find a subreddit specific for the audience you're looking for for example there's a tycoon subreddit there's one for turnbased strategy or maybe you can even post in subreddits of other popular games similar to yours but do be careful with red rules some silver edits are very strict about selfpromotion there's also tick tock personally i have not explored this one yet i'm not familiar with it but i did hear some indies are finding quite a lot of success then a tried and true method you have a mailing list just have a sign up form on your website mention it whenever you mention your game and keep growing that list usually people who sign up to a mailing list are already preinterested so growing this one is very difficult but very powerful another technique a lot of people have used successfully is making a free prologue so kind of like making a free demo if you design the demo correctly and it leaves people wanting more then you will likely gather a nice amount of wishlist and related to that free prologue something more recent are the steam festivals i believe they have some rules on when you can submit but if you can definitely take advantage of it for example the game i mentioned a while ago lens island by floyd studio they benefited massively from participating in this team festival it's great for gathering tons and tons of wishlists even if those then convert less than the organic questions and of course you also have paid marketing this one will naturally depend on the funds you have available as well as the price of your game if you have a very cheap five dollar game it's pretty difficult to make paid marketing work but if your game is 15 or 20 dollars then at that point it becomes much more doable so those are just a bunch of ways you can do some marketing you might be thinking to yourself okay that sounds good but it's way too much work so again let me remind you that the alternative to doing no marketing is getting no sales so either you put in the work or you have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a reality whether you like it or not as for metrics specifically on steam there's some you should track like i've already mentioned the most important one is wishlists wishlists are one of the ways that the steam algorithm learns that your game is popular the more wish list you have at launch the more steam will promote your game and everyone who wish list will receive a notification when your game launches then the more those wishlists convert the more steam promotes your game further and further another one related to it are followers these are people who click on the follow button on your store page it means they will receive notifications of any announcements you post so followers are kind of like super wishlists as for specific numbers naturally higher is better you should aim for at the very least having around 1500 followers and 5 000 wishlists if you've been working on your game for many years and you generally believe in its quality and you're under that number in that case i would honestly delay the launch and focus hard on marketing until you achieve those you only get one launch it's nearly impossible to come back after a bad one there were some reports although i don't think they've been confirmed that seam has some sort of bar at around 10 000 wish lists meaning that if you get that much you will automatically get much more visibility on the lunch again not sure if that's a fact or just a rumor but regardless more is better so yes the number one most important skill if you want to be successful in the game developer is indeed marketing regardless of how you feel about that it is simply the reality if you refuse to do it then your game will most likely be a flop so do work hard to make your game as best as it can be but also work hard to actually tell lots of people about it this one is a really important topic so i'm really glad i made this video i'm happy you made it to the end and i really really hope this information helps you make your game a huge success now go ahead and hit the like button so more people can find this video and help those people not waste their time by ignoring marketing alright thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
