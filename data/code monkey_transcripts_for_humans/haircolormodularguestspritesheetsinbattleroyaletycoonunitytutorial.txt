00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're continuing to create
00:03 - modular spreadsheets as used in battle
00:05 - round tycoon we're going to further
00:06 - increase the randomization of our
00:08 - characters by adding hair collet let's
00:10 - begin
00:13 - okay so here's our dynamically created
00:15 - spreadsheet it is composed of a base
00:17 - price sheet then added on top of that we
00:20 - have a body that on top of that we have
00:22 - our head which itself is composed of a
00:24 - basehead plus some hair and some beard
00:26 - with just these options we already have
00:29 - a lot of variation but now we're going
00:31 - to go one step further and make our hair
00:33 - color also randomizer the game is out no
00:35 - one seems so check it out to see what
00:37 - I'm teaching here apply to a real game
00:38 - so here are all the spreadsheets first
00:41 - there's the base with just the hand and
00:42 - the foot then we've got a beard which is
00:45 - when we're currently using which is
00:47 - already tinted and brown same thing for
00:49 - our hair and then we have the base head
00:51 - spreadsheet so now we're going to do
00:53 - instead of using the hair that is
00:54 - already tinted we're going to use a
00:56 - white texture which is what we're going
00:58 - to use to tend with a certain color
01:00 - we're going to use a multiplication
01:02 - filter so the white parts won't be the
01:04 - exact color of our tent and the great
01:06 - parts won't be interpolated somewhere in
01:08 - between so let's go to the code and
01:10 - let's go to where we're creating our
01:13 - texture in here so first we grab the
01:15 - base pixels and we set them on our
01:17 - texture okay then we are grabbing the
01:19 - head pixels based on our base head which
01:21 - is the same thing we want to do right
01:23 - now then on top of that we're grabbing
01:25 - the hair pixels and then we merge the
01:27 - color array of the hair pixels on top of
01:30 - the head pixels so before we do this
01:32 - merge we want to tend the hair pixels
01:34 - that we grab from the texture so let's
01:36 - go down here to make a function I'm
01:39 - going to make a private void tint color
01:41 - array we're going to receive a color
01:45 - array for our base array and a color for
01:48 - the tent so we're going to cycle through
01:50 - every pixel so do a four and then we
01:56 - apply the tint to each pixel so we set
01:59 - the base array of in X I read to be the
02:04 - red color x the tint right
02:07 - then do the same thing for all the
02:09 - others so we have our function which
02:13 - multiplies the tint towards whatever is
02:16 - on the base around so we can now go all
02:18 - the way up here and before we merge our
02:21 - color arrays let's tint the corner
02:24 - right we want to tend the hair pixels
02:26 - and let's define a hair color to tint it
02:30 - with so in here to find a color for the
02:32 - hair color and here I'm going to go into
02:35 - the u tones class in order to use the
02:38 - get string from color this function is
02:40 - part of the code monkey utilities that
02:42 - you can grab for free from unity code
02:43 - Montcalm and this is very helpful
02:45 - because lets me calculate a color using
02:48 - a hex string alright so I have here a
02:51 - hexadecimal code for our color we take
02:53 - that hair color and we apply that tint
02:55 - into our hair pixels which will now be
02:57 - simply white so after we have tinted
03:00 - then we merge it into the head pixels
03:02 - and do the same thing as previously and
03:04 - for now let's disable the beard so in
03:06 - here set it to false and here set the
03:09 - hair always to true okay so we should
03:12 - now be able to test our code and see the
03:13 - color of our hair and yep there's the
03:16 - sprite sheet using blond hair as you can
03:18 - see the pixels are correctly multiplying
03:20 - the white part is exactly blond and the
03:23 - darker areas of the hair FA darker blond
03:25 - cone okay so now that we have this on
03:27 - our hair we can simply apply to our
03:29 - beard now we could have a different
03:32 - color for the hair and for the beard but
03:33 - normally the colors are the same so
03:36 - let's define our hair color out here
03:45 - okay so here I have an array of a bunch
03:47 - of hair colors I am picking a random one
03:50 - from the array then I tint the hair
03:53 - pixels with the hair color and down here
03:55 - I need to do the same thing for the
03:56 - appeared pixels tentaclear pixels with
03:59 - the same hair color
04:00 - and everything else is exactly the same
04:02 - I'm so only having hair on 70% of time
04:04 - same thing for the beard and some
04:06 - randomizing between 0 and 4 in order to
04:08 - get all the indexes so let's see and yet
04:11 - there's a spreadsheet being created with
04:13 - many different hair colors that are
04:15 - applied both to the hair and also to the
04:17 - beard the 10 that we've made works with
04:20 - any color so if it fits with your game
04:22 - you can feel free to tint it in any
04:24 - color you like like pink or blue the
04:26 - game is out now on Steam so check it out
04:28 - to see what I'm teaching here apply to a
04:29 - real game so there you have it we create
04:31 - our previous spreadsheet and add in more
04:33 - randomization with different hair counts
04:35 - in the next video we're going to tell
04:37 - the base face in order to
04:38 - different skin colors as always he can
04:40 - download the project files in utilities
04:41 - from Endicott monkey comm if you have
04:44 - any questions post them in the comments
04:45 - and I'll do my best incident subscribe
04:47 - for more videos and I'll see you next
04:48 - time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're continuing to create modular spreadsheets as used in battle round tycoon we're going to further increase the randomization of our characters by adding hair collet let's begin okay so here's our dynamically created spreadsheet it is composed of a base price sheet then added on top of that we have a body that on top of that we have our head which itself is composed of a basehead plus some hair and some beard with just these options we already have a lot of variation but now we're going to go one step further and make our hair color also randomizer the game is out no one seems so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game so here are all the spreadsheets first there's the base with just the hand and the foot then we've got a beard which is when we're currently using which is already tinted and brown same thing for our hair and then we have the base head spreadsheet so now we're going to do instead of using the hair that is already tinted we're going to use a white texture which is what we're going to use to tend with a certain color we're going to use a multiplication filter so the white parts won't be the exact color of our tent and the great parts won't be interpolated somewhere in between so let's go to the code and let's go to where we're creating our texture in here so first we grab the base pixels and we set them on our texture okay then we are grabbing the head pixels based on our base head which is the same thing we want to do right now then on top of that we're grabbing the hair pixels and then we merge the color array of the hair pixels on top of the head pixels so before we do this merge we want to tend the hair pixels that we grab from the texture so let's go down here to make a function I'm going to make a private void tint color array we're going to receive a color array for our base array and a color for the tent so we're going to cycle through every pixel so do a four and then we apply the tint to each pixel so we set the base array of in X I read to be the red color x the tint right then do the same thing for all the others so we have our function which multiplies the tint towards whatever is on the base around so we can now go all the way up here and before we merge our color arrays let's tint the corner right we want to tend the hair pixels and let's define a hair color to tint it with so in here to find a color for the hair color and here I'm going to go into the u tones class in order to use the get string from color this function is part of the code monkey utilities that you can grab for free from unity code Montcalm and this is very helpful because lets me calculate a color using a hex string alright so I have here a hexadecimal code for our color we take that hair color and we apply that tint into our hair pixels which will now be simply white so after we have tinted then we merge it into the head pixels and do the same thing as previously and for now let's disable the beard so in here set it to false and here set the hair always to true okay so we should now be able to test our code and see the color of our hair and yep there's the sprite sheet using blond hair as you can see the pixels are correctly multiplying the white part is exactly blond and the darker areas of the hair FA darker blond cone okay so now that we have this on our hair we can simply apply to our beard now we could have a different color for the hair and for the beard but normally the colors are the same so let's define our hair color out here okay so here I have an array of a bunch of hair colors I am picking a random one from the array then I tint the hair pixels with the hair color and down here I need to do the same thing for the appeared pixels tentaclear pixels with the same hair color and everything else is exactly the same I'm so only having hair on 70% of time same thing for the beard and some randomizing between 0 and 4 in order to get all the indexes so let's see and yet there's a spreadsheet being created with many different hair colors that are applied both to the hair and also to the beard the 10 that we've made works with any color so if it fits with your game you can feel free to tint it in any color you like like pink or blue the game is out now on Steam so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game so there you have it we create our previous spreadsheet and add in more randomization with different hair counts in the next video we're going to tell the base face in order to different skin colors as always he can download the project files in utilities from Endicott monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best incident subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
