00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - GDC was last week and unity invited me
00:04 - and a bunch of other kind of creators so
00:06 - here let's do a quick recap of
00:08 - everything that I saw mainly on the
00:10 - topic of the feature of unity based on
00:12 - the roadmap talk this involves dots
00:14 - multiplayer rendering new ugs tunnel
00:16 - several new samples and a bunch more
00:18 - then EMT also had some exclusive talks
00:21 - where we saw a bit more detail on a
00:23 - bunch of tools like for example the
00:24 - recently unveiled dntai a lot of it is
00:27 - behind NDA but still there are some
00:28 - details that I can share there was also
00:30 - a general q a at gedc where tons of
00:33 - people asked all kinds of interesting
00:34 - questions
00:35 - and we had a meet up where lots of
00:37 - people showed up which was really great
00:39 - this was my very first GDC so this was
00:41 - an awesome very busy week here I'm going
00:43 - to try to cover everything in this quick
00:45 - recap video so let's do it and like I
00:47 - said ENT flew me over there so this
00:49 - video is sponsored by yinty okay so
00:51 - starting off with the thing that most
00:52 - people are interested in which was the
00:54 - roadmap Tonk I believe they won't be
00:56 - publishing this one and some more talks
00:57 - on their YouTube channel in the coming
00:59 - days the roadmap covered quite a lot of
01:01 - things a bunch of those are already out
01:03 - in version 22.2 a bunch more are coming
01:06 - out or getting some upgrades with the 22
01:08 - LTS which should be coming out in the
01:10 - next few months and finally we got a
01:11 - bunch of previews on what's coming up in
01:13 - 23.1 and Beyond this talk actually
01:15 - started in a very important Way by
01:17 - reiterating what they've already said
01:19 - several times before which is how
01:20 - they're always looking for feedback
01:22 - every tool they build there's always a
01:24 - way to get in contact with the team you
01:25 - can post on Discord Forums on Reddit
01:27 - personally I know that recently as I was
01:30 - researching game server hosting and
01:31 - Matchmaker I had a bunch of questions
01:32 - and feedback which I post on the forums
01:34 - then one thing they've been doing
01:36 - recently are the game Focus blog posts
01:38 - where they talk about all kinds of
01:40 - things they've been doing all related to
01:41 - game development and they've also done a
01:43 - bunch of devlets this is where one team
01:45 - from UNT won't be present for an entire
01:47 - day and you can ask them any questions
01:49 - you want so if you have any issues or
01:51 - feedback with unity definitely go ahead
01:53 - and tell them that's the main way that
01:54 - the engine improves for everyone the
01:56 - thing that most people want to hear
01:57 - about is on dots which continues to be
01:59 - on track for hitting 1.0 production
02:01 - ready in the 22 MTS version so that
02:04 - should be out before summer the 1.0
02:06 - version is actually already out in
02:07 - preview I've made a pretty detailed
02:09 - tutorial on it and the final 1.0 version
02:11 - should be very similar to that honestly
02:13 - for this part what stuck out me the most
02:15 - was simply just how many examples
02:16 - already exist of games using dots even
02:19 - though it's not technically production
02:20 - ready there aren't really many games
02:21 - using it either currently in production
02:23 - or already out the mini XML for this
02:26 - talk was heroish it's a nice action
02:28 - strategy game that doesn't really have
02:29 - hundreds of thousands of units but still
02:31 - benefited from using dots another
02:34 - example is re-rising which use dots for
02:36 - worm streaming the recent game Axion
02:38 - also had a huge scale with tons of
02:40 - systems detonation racing was one that
02:43 - was showcased in a previous Tonk and
02:44 - uses dots for control and determinism
02:46 - then the game Hassan Mars uses it for
02:49 - massive simulation scale and in
02:51 - multiplayer the game hysteria is using
02:52 - netcode for entities also very important
02:54 - is how all of these games are using a
02:56 - hybrid workflow meaning they are
02:58 - combining entities and game objects
03:00 - instead of going 100 empties that means
03:02 - that the workflows that you've already
03:04 - learned using Game objects they are
03:06 - still very much applicable when working
03:07 - with entities now if you use writer as
03:10 - your code editor then it's also getting
03:11 - a huge upgrade to support the dots
03:13 - workflows it helps you quickly create
03:15 - systems and inspect the generated source
03:17 - code you can easily create Bakers and
03:19 - authoring components as well as
03:21 - generating some aspects it also helps
03:23 - you find problems in your code like for
03:25 - example some missing queries so if you
03:27 - use render and you want to work with
03:28 - dots this can really help you speed up
03:30 - development also on dots you might have
03:32 - heard a while ago they acquired a really
03:34 - awesome dance character controller that
03:36 - used to be a paid asset but now it's
03:38 - free instead of being on the SSR it is
03:40 - now in the package manager each package
03:42 - has its own verification process but
03:43 - hopefully this one will also hit 1.0
03:45 - verified alongside the dots 1.0 also one
03:48 - very important detail that I heard in
03:50 - one of the exclusive Tonks was their
03:51 - plans for Dots in the future after 1.0
03:53 - obviously they are working on building
03:55 - upon this 1.0 base in the future they
03:57 - won't be adding things like a dots
03:59 - animation system however very very
04:01 - importantly is how they made it very
04:02 - clear that the primary focus for Dots is
04:04 - stability and Bug fixes over adding new
04:07 - features they really want this to be a
04:09 - very solid release that will help you
04:10 - build games that were simply not
04:11 - possible previously so the focus is
04:13 - first on stability and only secondly on
04:15 - adding new features then the other
04:17 - really big area they've been working on
04:18 - this past year and they are continuing
04:20 - is multiplayer as you might know netcode
04:22 - for game object is already production
04:23 - writing I made a phone free course on it
04:26 - a while ago it's already a very capable
04:28 - very robust tool set network for game
04:30 - objects is meant for small scale co-op
04:32 - games so an excellent example that they
04:34 - showed is she performs it's a perfect
04:36 - example of the small scale Co-op game
04:38 - then for super fast competitive games
04:41 - you have an echo for entities I believe
04:43 - this one is also meant to hit 1.0
04:45 - alongside the 22 LTS version and one
04:48 - really awesome piece of news is how they
04:49 - have taken the awesome Mega City demo
04:51 - that the bump for Dots a long time ago
04:53 - and they refactored it to make it work
04:55 - with dots 1.0 and also made it using
04:57 - netcode for NTS so this is a really
04:59 - awesome fully working sample with up to
05:01 - 64 players and it should be coming soon
05:03 - related to multiplayer is the entire
05:05 - Unity gaming Services Suite of tools
05:07 - they already have tons of them I've
05:09 - already covered quite a lot of them for
05:11 - example in my free multiplayer course I
05:13 - use NECA frame objects then I use Lobby
05:16 - to create a Lobby and relay to handle
05:17 - the connections later on I also made
05:19 - dedicated tutorials for using Matchmaker
05:22 - and Game Server hosting and of course
05:24 - all of those tools require
05:25 - authentication and I've also covered
05:27 - cloudcon delivery in my ultimate TNT
05:29 - ovary course coming soon are also a
05:31 - bunch more interesting tools there's
05:33 - Unity friends to help you easily manage
05:35 - a friend list you until leaderboards to
05:38 - help you track player scores and
05:40 - something really exciting which is user
05:42 - generated content I actually got to see
05:43 - a bunch more details on this one too on
05:45 - an exclusive talk in their offices I'm
05:47 - not allowed to share any details but I
05:49 - can say that what I saw looks really
05:51 - awesome I generally think this will be
05:53 - an excellent addition to this entire ugs
05:55 - tool Sac nowadays user generated content
05:57 - is a really big thing players really
05:59 - enjoy it and having a way to add it much
06:01 - more easily to your game is an excellent
06:03 - thing and of course they also
06:04 - highlighted how all of these symbols are
06:06 - engine agnostic meaning that you could
06:08 - use any of these in a game made with
06:10 - unreal Arc though like for example Apex
06:12 - Legends is not made with the NTM engine
06:15 - but it does use unity's Game Server
06:17 - hosting then for a bunch more ugs
06:19 - announcements Cloud code is getting
06:21 - c-sharp support instead of just
06:22 - JavaScript it is also getting some
06:24 - triggers and events so you can run logic
06:26 - periodically instead of just when called
06:28 - upon by a player Cloud save is getting
06:30 - support for binary data instead of just
06:32 - Json this way you can store anything you
06:34 - want remote config is also being
06:37 - expanded to support both Json and basic
06:39 - strings you can also add rules to
06:41 - prevent incorrect data so no there's a
06:43 - bunch of new tools and plenty of
06:45 - improvements to already existing ones
06:46 - something obviously very important to a
06:48 - successful game are Graphics this
06:51 - portion actually started with a really
06:52 - nice statistic nowadays most games are
06:55 - already using one of the two script mode
06:56 - render pipelines either urp or ajrp and
07:00 - something very important for visuals is
07:01 - simply performance their attacks 12 is
07:04 - finally fully production ready this one
07:06 - has been in preview for ages so it's
07:07 - great to finally see it come out this
07:09 - gives you a great performance boost
07:10 - pretty much across the board with
07:12 - regards to lighting adaptive Pro volumes
07:15 - is the one big feature coming soon
07:16 - handling light probes is always a pain
07:18 - so this is definitely a welcome addition
07:20 - these are currently already available in
07:22 - ajrp and they are coming to urp in 23.1
07:25 - basically this helps you easily Place
07:26 - light probes in your world another great
07:28 - addition is per pixel Lighting on light
07:30 - probes this helps you generate much more
07:33 - accurate lighting when using light
07:34 - probes especially on very large objects
07:36 - another feature are lighting scenarios
07:38 - this is how you can bake lights in
07:40 - various ways and then seamlessly swap
07:42 - between them
07:43 - this makes building a then night cycle
07:45 - really easy
07:46 - speaking of making the GPU on light
07:48 - mapper is coming out of preview in 23.2
07:50 - this is another one that I had been in
07:52 - preview for a very long time and they've
07:55 - also managed to lower the requirements
07:56 - from 4 gigabytes down to 2 gigabytes
07:58 - already in 22.2 is the excellent water
08:01 - system for egrp it already looks really
08:04 - gorgeous with the ability to simulate
08:05 - all kinds of bodies of water for a bunch
08:07 - more rendering announcements for it was
08:10 - rendering in urp which allows you to
08:11 - have tons and tons of Lights found the
08:14 - Crossfade which makes for some really
08:15 - smooth transitions you have decal layers
08:18 - so you can place down some decals and
08:19 - not have it affect certain objects then
08:22 - temporal anti-aliasing which can really
08:23 - help cut down on the kind of Shimmer
08:25 - effect the Shader graph phone screen
08:27 - masternode is excellent for making
08:28 - custom post processing effects there is
08:30 - also something called custom rendered
08:32 - textures now this actually unrelated to
08:34 - the usual render textures instead this
08:36 - is about generating a texture using
08:38 - nothing but a Shader hdrp is getting
08:41 - some really awesome looking volumetric
08:43 - fog and there's a whole bunch of samples
08:45 - that you can try out also the shaders
08:47 - using the enemy's demo they are
08:48 - available for you to download and
08:49 - inspect I also saw a really impressive
08:51 - Ziva demo on the show floor basically
08:54 - this is facial motion driven by Machine
08:56 - learning which means you can achieve it
08:57 - in a really tiny size the guy at the
08:59 - booth mentioned how the original enemy's
09:01 - demo required something like a gigabyte
09:03 - of data just for the facial performance
09:04 - whereas with a civil puppet they could
09:07 - get very close to the same level of
09:08 - quality which is 15 megabytes it still
09:10 - encounters quite a bit to create a Ziva
09:12 - pump end that costs apparently eighteen
09:14 - hundred dollars but you can imagine how
09:16 - over time as that cost comes down soon
09:18 - enough every NPC in an indie game could
09:20 - have this level of quality for facial
09:21 - capture another tool that is also owned
09:24 - by unity but personally I've never used
09:25 - it is speed train
09:27 - this one continues getting updates it
09:29 - has exists for many many years I
09:31 - actually saw a really nice demo at the
09:32 - UNT booth and it looks really powerful
09:34 - and actually pretty simple to use I need
09:37 - to do some research but I might do a
09:38 - tutorial on this sometime in the future
09:39 - then swines which are already available
09:41 - in 22 and they are being used more often
09:44 - like in letting you create Dynamic
09:45 - meshes to populate your worlds you can
09:47 - also merge meshes create multiple splits
09:50 - and so on
09:51 - and for urp the one big update is
09:53 - actually the brand new sample scene now
09:55 - this is one simple scene but really it's
09:57 - three in one you have an intro area
09:59 - where it showcases photorealistic
10:01 - visuals then there's a garden showcasing
10:03 - a more stylized look with tons of
10:05 - dynamic lights and finally there's a
10:07 - space game showcasing a hyper stylized
10:09 - scene with some really nice custom
10:10 - lighting I'm definitely looking forward
10:12 - to trying out this simple when it comes
10:14 - out then the evfx graph is also getting
10:16 - improvements in 22 LTS they are adding
10:19 - instancing support
10:20 - this lets you spawn multiple instances
10:22 - of the exact same effect with very
10:24 - little CPU overhead there are also some
10:26 - Boolean ports that let you enable or
10:28 - disable only certain parts of an effect
10:30 - you can now write custom agent LSL
10:32 - blocks so if you have some logic where
10:34 - it's easier to just write the code
10:35 - instead of using nodes and this can
10:37 - really help you you can mix both nodes
10:39 - and code and perhaps most impressive of
10:42 - all is six when lighting this lets you
10:44 - bake lighting from multiple directions
10:46 - all in the same flipbook on different
10:48 - channels then you can place that object
10:50 - that effect anywhere in the world and it
10:52 - works perfectly in any lighting
10:54 - condition the results look really
10:55 - awesome wherever the effect is placed it
10:57 - always looks good there's also a blog
10:59 - post diving into more detail on this one
11:01 - and of course another pillar of unity is
11:03 - how it runs on everything it supports
11:05 - basically every platform so there are a
11:07 - bunch more improvements when it comes to
11:08 - mobile now this is an area that I don't
11:10 - know much about but new features do seem
11:12 - very useful like for example mentioning
11:14 - the config files directly inside Unity
11:16 - desktop and console got some incremental
11:18 - builds this feature was actually already
11:20 - be super helpful to me when I was making
11:22 - my multiplayer course in there I had to
11:24 - make builds all the time and thanks to
11:26 - this incremental builds feature making
11:28 - each of those builds was super easy
11:29 - really fast then you can soon deploy to
11:32 - Chrome OS and there's rm64 support
11:34 - coming to Windows for the web this is
11:37 - also getting a ton of improvements
11:38 - mobile and browser support has been
11:40 - lacking for quite a while but now
11:42 - they're really working on it and
11:43 - something pretty amazing is webgl
11:45 - multi-threading so soon enough you won't
11:47 - be able to run multi-threaded native C
11:49 - plus code on a webgl build that is
11:52 - really impressive another very important
11:53 - platform is XR so that's VR and AR
11:56 - it's also another topic that I'd love to
11:58 - cover whenever I can find the time again
12:01 - they support pretty much every platform
12:02 - including the recently released
12:04 - PlayStation VR2 and metaquest pro for
12:06 - psvr 2 they added support for foviated
12:08 - rendering this one feature really helps
12:11 - on performance another performance
12:13 - feature is single pass rendering this
12:15 - really reduces CPU overhead when
12:17 - rendering both eyes as well as haptics
12:19 - and audio and again lots of awesome
12:21 - games already out on Playstation VR2 all
12:24 - of them made with yinty for input the XR
12:27 - interaction toolkit continues getting
12:28 - updates and something really impressive
12:31 - is the simulation package this helps you
12:33 - test AR and VR directly in the editor
12:35 - without having to physically put on a
12:37 - headset there are a bunch more
12:38 - interaction examples coming soon as well
12:40 - as some project templates so really
12:42 - regardless of your target platform Unity
12:44 - has a team working on it then for some
12:46 - smaller but still very important
12:47 - improvements on rating 22 is the bone
12:50 - package management with this you can
12:52 - select and manage multiple packages at
12:53 - once really useful they also added
12:55 - support for the USC found format this
12:58 - apparently really widely used in many
12:59 - Industries addressables now gives you a
13:02 - addressable build Report with this you
13:04 - can identify how the asset bundles are
13:06 - being created for code they are
13:08 - updating.net migrating to Microsoft's
13:10 - course CLR as well as continue the
13:12 - improvements to enter play mode faster
13:14 - there are also unifying their existing
13:16 - asynchronous code base making it to use
13:18 - the regular c-sharp async await keywords
13:21 - you can already see this unification in
13:23 - action in all of the ugs tools like the
13:25 - 11 really they already use async await
13:28 - in similar ways the input system
13:30 - continues getting updates in the future
13:32 - they are working on streamlining the
13:33 - getting started process the memory
13:35 - profiler is now a verified package ey
13:38 - tonkit got a bunch more upgrades
13:40 - including a really awesome sample that
13:42 - is already out as well as some more
13:44 - search improvements including searching
13:45 - through right-click menus and a whole
13:48 - bunch more so Unity truly is massive
13:50 - nowadays so many areas so many use cases
13:52 - it's impossible to cover everything that
13:54 - everything is doing but this roadmap
13:56 - really shows you the scale of the engine
13:58 - there are so many things already out and
13:59 - so many still to come in every area one
14:02 - very important thing that was absent
14:03 - from the road map was actually announced
14:05 - literally on that very same day was
14:07 - yinty AI this is an extremely important
14:09 - topic so I'm actually going to cover
14:10 - this in a separate dedicated video I
14:12 - want to do that because I imagine tons
14:14 - of people are going to be looking for
14:15 - info specifically on the anti AI so I
14:17 - want to separate that from the general
14:19 - roadmap and GDC recap but for now I can
14:21 - say that the response has been pre-mixed
14:23 - and most of it actually for a very good
14:25 - reason since it's extremely light on
14:27 - details but I can also say that Unity
14:29 - had an exclusive session where they
14:31 - showed us the tools that they're working
14:32 - on and what are their goals and getting
14:34 - principles with unity alley and based on
14:37 - what I've seen I would say that the team
14:38 - is very much on the right track they are
14:40 - very focused on doing it ethically and
14:42 - correctly it's all behind NDA so I can't
14:44 - say too much but I'm going to cover that
14:46 - in a bit more detail in the next video
14:47 - they also have a signup form I've Linked
14:50 - In the description so if you want go
14:51 - ahead and sign up and stay tuned for the
14:53 - video later this week one very
14:55 - interesting topic was right at the end
14:56 - it was the ENT q a a basically about a
14:59 - dozen Unity people from all kinds of
15:01 - teams were there ready to answer
15:03 - anything all the questions were
15:05 - extremely varied on all kinds of topics
15:06 - I wrote them all down so here's some
15:08 - quick highlights one of the more
15:10 - important questions was with regards to
15:12 - empty answers if you've ever been there
15:14 - then you know there's a really annoying
15:15 - bug where it replaces the word high with
15:17 - Anonymous which makes so many answers
15:19 - nearly impossible to read a while ago
15:22 - EMT actually planned on doing something
15:23 - pretty dumb they were going to close in
15:25 - the answers and can only remove it from
15:27 - the internet obviously the response from
15:29 - the community was very negative and very
15:31 - intense thankfully unity and listened to
15:33 - that feedback and walked back on their
15:34 - plans so even the answer still exists
15:36 - but it does exist with that bug and a
15:38 - very old very hard to use platform the
15:41 - answer to this is that instead of fixing
15:43 - just that one specific bug they're
15:44 - actually working on upgrading the entire
15:46 - platform itself so rather than just a
15:48 - Band-Aid they are working on a proper
15:50 - Unity answers platform no details on any
15:52 - timeline but hopefully soon related to
15:54 - feedback someone asked why does ent have
15:56 - so many options there is Discord Reddit
15:59 - forums GitHub threads and many more the
16:01 - answer is that each platform serves a
16:03 - different purpose and personally I very
16:05 - much agree with that answer personally I
16:07 - do not like Discord because I don't have
16:09 - the time for a real-time platform so I
16:11 - can't really use it I much prefer the
16:13 - asynchronous form but tons of people do
16:15 - love Discord so in this case I would
16:17 - definitely say more options is
16:18 - definitely better then someone asked
16:20 - about mixing local and online co-op with
16:22 - Nesco for game objects meaning for
16:24 - example have a game where you have two
16:26 - local clients playing in the same
16:27 - session and two more online clients you
16:30 - need to answer that right now it's not
16:32 - really made for that but it is something
16:33 - they are actively working on they're
16:36 - working on abstracting out the netcode
16:37 - layer which would then enable you to
16:39 - create a domain local client
16:40 - someone asks an interesting question on
16:42 - the ENT bug reports and what does won't
16:44 - fix mean
16:45 - the answer is it can actually mean
16:47 - several things it could be there's
16:49 - already a valid workaround or it could
16:51 - be that this specific bug is some of
16:53 - using a different better tool or it
16:55 - could simply be that the number of users
16:57 - affected by it is a tiny number and
16:59 - fixing it would actually require a
17:00 - massive refactor of whatever system it
17:02 - involves and based on that it's simply
17:04 - not worth it to take developers from
17:05 - other projects to fix whatever that bug
17:07 - is one interesting question was with
17:09 - regards to accessibility and what is
17:11 - Unity doing about that their answer is
17:13 - they are in the beginning stages of
17:15 - implementing accessibility options to
17:17 - the UNT editor itself so that everyone
17:18 - can make aims and for game accessibility
17:21 - there is apparently a colorblindness
17:23 - post-processing sample which you can
17:24 - inspect in the Shader graph samples and
17:27 - if you want to learn more about this
17:28 - topic then they also recommend the
17:29 - website gameaccessibilityguidelines.com
17:32 - then for a two-part question are unity
17:34 - themselves working on some kind of
17:36 - multiplayer multi-platform game the
17:38 - answer to the first part is Unity making
17:40 - a game themselves the answer is no some
17:42 - people always get annoyed at that answer
17:43 - but honestly I can see their point of
17:45 - view their answer is they already use
17:47 - the engine themselves through the
17:49 - various programs they have where they
17:50 - work closely with developers this way
17:52 - they can improve the engine by having a
17:54 - team constantly go out and interact with
17:55 - dozens of unique projects instead of
17:57 - having just a single in-house team
17:59 - building a single project I definitely
18:01 - wish gigai had continued but I can also
18:03 - see their point of view and the second
18:05 - part of that question is with regards to
18:07 - multi-platform
18:08 - the answer is this is a tricky subject
18:10 - because pretty much everything related
18:12 - to platforms like the console sdks all
18:14 - of that is behind strict NDA so they
18:16 - can't really share any specifics on it
18:18 - but they did mention they are actively
18:20 - working on providing some kind of
18:21 - abstraction and some ways to help you
18:23 - pass certification then someone asked
18:25 - about upgrading a ENT version and how it
18:27 - sucks to be stuck on a known version and
18:29 - doing an upgrade could be too high risk
18:31 - so what to do about that and which
18:33 - version to pick when starting a new
18:35 - project the answer is depending on your
18:37 - death cycle you should choose the
18:39 - version that won't be on LTS by the time
18:40 - you release so for example if you're
18:42 - launching a game in the next six months
18:44 - go ahead and use version 22 which won't
18:45 - be in LTS by then but if you're for
18:47 - example more than a year out then
18:49 - perhaps use version 23 and with regards
18:51 - to upgrades they mentioned that they've
18:53 - been working on simplifying that process
18:54 - and I can definitely confirm that is the
18:56 - case I remember back in the unity five
18:59 - days that upgrading the UNT version
19:00 - really meant fixing tons and tons of
19:02 - bugs whereas nowadays honestly I don't
19:04 - remember the last time that I had issues
19:06 - upgrading I can take a version from
19:08 - Unity 2019 and upgrade it to 22 and
19:11 - everything works fine
19:12 - one thing that could cause issues are
19:14 - the graphics since those have gone
19:16 - through some pretty significant changes
19:17 - over the past few years the answer to
19:19 - that one is check the Apex website and
19:21 - look at the upgrade guides someone asked
19:23 - a question on what resources to help
19:25 - students learn Unity pointed out that
19:27 - there are plenty of courses and
19:28 - tutorials on untl learn they also have
19:31 - tons of resources on resources.dmt.com
19:33 - their free ebooks are especially
19:36 - excellent I've read a bunch of them and
19:38 - they do contain tons of awesome info so
19:40 - that's unt's answer and of course my own
19:42 - answer in terms of learning material is
19:44 - I would suggest browse this Channel or
19:46 - just YouTube in general then there was a
19:48 - high school teacher helping their kids
19:50 - make a punk game using NGO and trying to
19:52 - deploy to webgl but it didn't work the
19:55 - answer is that nope right now webgl does
19:57 - not work with UNT transport the version
20:00 - 1.0 doesn't work on the web because it
20:02 - has no websocket whereas Transformer 2.0
20:04 - will support it it is currently an
20:06 - experimental and it might be production
20:08 - ready in 2020s so that's a bunch of
20:10 - questions this q a section was pretty
20:13 - great lots of interesting questions
20:14 - including things that I'd never thought
20:16 - to ask about then one thing that
20:18 - happened during GDC was actually the
20:19 - Meetup this was mainly organized by Matt
20:21 - from Game Dev guide and and mark from
20:23 - game maker sungit I then really
20:25 - announced it myself because it was my
20:27 - very first GDC so I had no idea if I was
20:29 - going to be busy watching some talks at
20:31 - that time
20:32 - but I did end up going I was there
20:34 - alongside a bunch of other awesome
20:35 - content creators and tons of people
20:37 - showed up I'm gonna say that I am very
20:39 - much an introvert so I was pretty
20:40 - stressed out about going to a Meetup but
20:42 - thankfully everyone was super nice
20:44 - even though I don't use the camera in my
20:46 - videos there was still a bunch of people
20:47 - that recognized me and said hello
20:49 - it was awesome to meet so many people
20:51 - working on so many interesting unique
20:52 - projects there was someone building a
20:54 - game like Animal Crossing and using my
20:56 - grid system tutorials to make the house
20:58 - furniture system someone was working on
21:00 - a game and needed to learn pathfinding
21:02 - and they used my video to learn the
21:03 - algorithm a bunch of people said they
21:05 - were going through my turn-based
21:06 - strategy course
21:07 - then also spoke to someone who was
21:09 - building an MMO another one working on
21:11 - the Diablo like all in all tons of
21:13 - awesome people working on lots of
21:14 - different projects and everyone was
21:16 - super nice so thank you all to everyone
21:18 - who showed up I hope you had fun meeting
21:20 - myself and all the other content
21:21 - creators if you don't know any of these
21:23 - then go ahead and subscribe to them the
21:25 - Meetup did go really well so hopefully
21:27 - next year let's do this again beyond
21:29 - that since this was my very first GDC
21:31 - everything was so new to me I very much
21:33 - enjoyed walking around the show floor
21:35 - looking out all the awesome things on
21:36 - display
21:37 - there were lots of awesome motion
21:39 - capture suits a bunch of server tools
21:41 - some audio tools lots of AR glasses and
21:44 - tons more companies that I have no idea
21:45 - what they actually do just by looking at
21:47 - the booth I also enjoyed watching the
21:49 - various booths for each country as
21:51 - someone who loves management and
21:52 - simulation games I definitely enjoy the
21:54 - Germany booth there was a section for
21:56 - the ngf awards with tons of awesome
21:58 - Indie Games also some game Publishers
22:00 - which is where I found out the awesome
22:02 - game Dyson Sphere program is actually
22:03 - getting a really nice update soon then
22:05 - it was fun to see both the unity and
22:07 - unreal boo side by side both had some
22:10 - learning sessions to learn how to use
22:11 - the engine a bunch of demos showcasing
22:13 - all kinds of tools
22:15 - and of course Showcases of lots of games
22:17 - built using the engines looking at those
22:19 - really tells you how the engines are
22:21 - just zooms it's all up to the developers
22:23 - to use the tools to make some awesome
22:24 - games
22:25 - Unity had Ship of Fools Undisputed and a
22:28 - bunch of mobile and tablet games then
22:30 - unreal had like a dragon Edition blue
22:32 - protocol and Hi-Fi Rush so both of them
22:35 - really showcase how the engines can be
22:36 - used to build any awesome game you can
22:38 - think of although I would say unreal
22:40 - actually had the better booth for one
22:41 - simple reason they had free cookies and
22:43 - Olive cookies so my suggestion to Unity
22:46 - is definitely add some cookies to the
22:47 - booth next year
22:48 - okay so that's my recap of gdc23 tons of
22:52 - awesome stuff this was a really busy
22:53 - week as always the featuring looks
22:55 - bright lots of great tools and updates
22:57 - already out and more coming in the
22:59 - future
22:59 - stay tuned for tutorials on a bunch of
23:01 - these new tools like for example int
23:03 - friends and leaderboards and stay tuned
23:05 - for the video covering neon TI coming
23:07 - later this week thank you to everyone
23:09 - who came to the Meetup and said hello
23:10 - thank you to Unity for flying me over
23:13 - for my very first CDC thank you for
23:15 - watching and I'll see you next time
23:25 - foreign

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey GDC was last week and unity invited me and a bunch of other kind of creators so here let's do a quick recap of everything that I saw mainly on the topic of the feature of unity based on the roadmap talk this involves dots multiplayer rendering new ugs tunnel several new samples and a bunch more then EMT also had some exclusive talks where we saw a bit more detail on a bunch of tools like for example the recently unveiled dntai a lot of it is behind NDA but still there are some details that I can share there was also a general q a at gedc where tons of people asked all kinds of interesting questions and we had a meet up where lots of people showed up which was really great this was my very first GDC so this was an awesome very busy week here I'm going to try to cover everything in this quick recap video so let's do it and like I said ENT flew me over there so this video is sponsored by yinty okay so starting off with the thing that most people are interested in which was the roadmap Tonk I believe they won't be publishing this one and some more talks on their YouTube channel in the coming days the roadmap covered quite a lot of things a bunch of those are already out in version 22.2 a bunch more are coming out or getting some upgrades with the 22 LTS which should be coming out in the next few months and finally we got a bunch of previews on what's coming up in 23.1 and Beyond this talk actually started in a very important Way by reiterating what they've already said several times before which is how they're always looking for feedback every tool they build there's always a way to get in contact with the team you can post on Discord Forums on Reddit personally I know that recently as I was researching game server hosting and Matchmaker I had a bunch of questions and feedback which I post on the forums then one thing they've been doing recently are the game Focus blog posts where they talk about all kinds of things they've been doing all related to game development and they've also done a bunch of devlets this is where one team from UNT won't be present for an entire day and you can ask them any questions you want so if you have any issues or feedback with unity definitely go ahead and tell them that's the main way that the engine improves for everyone the thing that most people want to hear about is on dots which continues to be on track for hitting 1.0 production ready in the 22 MTS version so that should be out before summer the 1.0 version is actually already out in preview I've made a pretty detailed tutorial on it and the final 1.0 version should be very similar to that honestly for this part what stuck out me the most was simply just how many examples already exist of games using dots even though it's not technically production ready there aren't really many games using it either currently in production or already out the mini XML for this talk was heroish it's a nice action strategy game that doesn't really have hundreds of thousands of units but still benefited from using dots another example is rerising which use dots for worm streaming the recent game Axion also had a huge scale with tons of systems detonation racing was one that was showcased in a previous Tonk and uses dots for control and determinism then the game Hassan Mars uses it for massive simulation scale and in multiplayer the game hysteria is using netcode for entities also very important is how all of these games are using a hybrid workflow meaning they are combining entities and game objects instead of going 100 empties that means that the workflows that you've already learned using Game objects they are still very much applicable when working with entities now if you use writer as your code editor then it's also getting a huge upgrade to support the dots workflows it helps you quickly create systems and inspect the generated source code you can easily create Bakers and authoring components as well as generating some aspects it also helps you find problems in your code like for example some missing queries so if you use render and you want to work with dots this can really help you speed up development also on dots you might have heard a while ago they acquired a really awesome dance character controller that used to be a paid asset but now it's free instead of being on the SSR it is now in the package manager each package has its own verification process but hopefully this one will also hit 1.0 verified alongside the dots 1.0 also one very important detail that I heard in one of the exclusive Tonks was their plans for Dots in the future after 1.0 obviously they are working on building upon this 1.0 base in the future they won't be adding things like a dots animation system however very very importantly is how they made it very clear that the primary focus for Dots is stability and Bug fixes over adding new features they really want this to be a very solid release that will help you build games that were simply not possible previously so the focus is first on stability and only secondly on adding new features then the other really big area they've been working on this past year and they are continuing is multiplayer as you might know netcode for game object is already production writing I made a phone free course on it a while ago it's already a very capable very robust tool set network for game objects is meant for small scale coop games so an excellent example that they showed is she performs it's a perfect example of the small scale Coop game then for super fast competitive games you have an echo for entities I believe this one is also meant to hit 1.0 alongside the 22 LTS version and one really awesome piece of news is how they have taken the awesome Mega City demo that the bump for Dots a long time ago and they refactored it to make it work with dots 1.0 and also made it using netcode for NTS so this is a really awesome fully working sample with up to 64 players and it should be coming soon related to multiplayer is the entire Unity gaming Services Suite of tools they already have tons of them I've already covered quite a lot of them for example in my free multiplayer course I use NECA frame objects then I use Lobby to create a Lobby and relay to handle the connections later on I also made dedicated tutorials for using Matchmaker and Game Server hosting and of course all of those tools require authentication and I've also covered cloudcon delivery in my ultimate TNT ovary course coming soon are also a bunch more interesting tools there's Unity friends to help you easily manage a friend list you until leaderboards to help you track player scores and something really exciting which is user generated content I actually got to see a bunch more details on this one too on an exclusive talk in their offices I'm not allowed to share any details but I can say that what I saw looks really awesome I generally think this will be an excellent addition to this entire ugs tool Sac nowadays user generated content is a really big thing players really enjoy it and having a way to add it much more easily to your game is an excellent thing and of course they also highlighted how all of these symbols are engine agnostic meaning that you could use any of these in a game made with unreal Arc though like for example Apex Legends is not made with the NTM engine but it does use unity's Game Server hosting then for a bunch more ugs announcements Cloud code is getting csharp support instead of just JavaScript it is also getting some triggers and events so you can run logic periodically instead of just when called upon by a player Cloud save is getting support for binary data instead of just Json this way you can store anything you want remote config is also being expanded to support both Json and basic strings you can also add rules to prevent incorrect data so no there's a bunch of new tools and plenty of improvements to already existing ones something obviously very important to a successful game are Graphics this portion actually started with a really nice statistic nowadays most games are already using one of the two script mode render pipelines either urp or ajrp and something very important for visuals is simply performance their attacks 12 is finally fully production ready this one has been in preview for ages so it's great to finally see it come out this gives you a great performance boost pretty much across the board with regards to lighting adaptive Pro volumes is the one big feature coming soon handling light probes is always a pain so this is definitely a welcome addition these are currently already available in ajrp and they are coming to urp in 23.1 basically this helps you easily Place light probes in your world another great addition is per pixel Lighting on light probes this helps you generate much more accurate lighting when using light probes especially on very large objects another feature are lighting scenarios this is how you can bake lights in various ways and then seamlessly swap between them this makes building a then night cycle really easy speaking of making the GPU on light mapper is coming out of preview in 23.2 this is another one that I had been in preview for a very long time and they've also managed to lower the requirements from 4 gigabytes down to 2 gigabytes already in 22.2 is the excellent water system for egrp it already looks really gorgeous with the ability to simulate all kinds of bodies of water for a bunch more rendering announcements for it was rendering in urp which allows you to have tons and tons of Lights found the Crossfade which makes for some really smooth transitions you have decal layers so you can place down some decals and not have it affect certain objects then temporal antialiasing which can really help cut down on the kind of Shimmer effect the Shader graph phone screen masternode is excellent for making custom post processing effects there is also something called custom rendered textures now this actually unrelated to the usual render textures instead this is about generating a texture using nothing but a Shader hdrp is getting some really awesome looking volumetric fog and there's a whole bunch of samples that you can try out also the shaders using the enemy's demo they are available for you to download and inspect I also saw a really impressive Ziva demo on the show floor basically this is facial motion driven by Machine learning which means you can achieve it in a really tiny size the guy at the booth mentioned how the original enemy's demo required something like a gigabyte of data just for the facial performance whereas with a civil puppet they could get very close to the same level of quality which is 15 megabytes it still encounters quite a bit to create a Ziva pump end that costs apparently eighteen hundred dollars but you can imagine how over time as that cost comes down soon enough every NPC in an indie game could have this level of quality for facial capture another tool that is also owned by unity but personally I've never used it is speed train this one continues getting updates it has exists for many many years I actually saw a really nice demo at the UNT booth and it looks really powerful and actually pretty simple to use I need to do some research but I might do a tutorial on this sometime in the future then swines which are already available in 22 and they are being used more often like in letting you create Dynamic meshes to populate your worlds you can also merge meshes create multiple splits and so on and for urp the one big update is actually the brand new sample scene now this is one simple scene but really it's three in one you have an intro area where it showcases photorealistic visuals then there's a garden showcasing a more stylized look with tons of dynamic lights and finally there's a space game showcasing a hyper stylized scene with some really nice custom lighting I'm definitely looking forward to trying out this simple when it comes out then the evfx graph is also getting improvements in 22 LTS they are adding instancing support this lets you spawn multiple instances of the exact same effect with very little CPU overhead there are also some Boolean ports that let you enable or disable only certain parts of an effect you can now write custom agent LSL blocks so if you have some logic where it's easier to just write the code instead of using nodes and this can really help you you can mix both nodes and code and perhaps most impressive of all is six when lighting this lets you bake lighting from multiple directions all in the same flipbook on different channels then you can place that object that effect anywhere in the world and it works perfectly in any lighting condition the results look really awesome wherever the effect is placed it always looks good there's also a blog post diving into more detail on this one and of course another pillar of unity is how it runs on everything it supports basically every platform so there are a bunch more improvements when it comes to mobile now this is an area that I don't know much about but new features do seem very useful like for example mentioning the config files directly inside Unity desktop and console got some incremental builds this feature was actually already be super helpful to me when I was making my multiplayer course in there I had to make builds all the time and thanks to this incremental builds feature making each of those builds was super easy really fast then you can soon deploy to Chrome OS and there's rm64 support coming to Windows for the web this is also getting a ton of improvements mobile and browser support has been lacking for quite a while but now they're really working on it and something pretty amazing is webgl multithreading so soon enough you won't be able to run multithreaded native C plus code on a webgl build that is really impressive another very important platform is XR so that's VR and AR it's also another topic that I'd love to cover whenever I can find the time again they support pretty much every platform including the recently released PlayStation VR2 and metaquest pro for psvr 2 they added support for foviated rendering this one feature really helps on performance another performance feature is single pass rendering this really reduces CPU overhead when rendering both eyes as well as haptics and audio and again lots of awesome games already out on Playstation VR2 all of them made with yinty for input the XR interaction toolkit continues getting updates and something really impressive is the simulation package this helps you test AR and VR directly in the editor without having to physically put on a headset there are a bunch more interaction examples coming soon as well as some project templates so really regardless of your target platform Unity has a team working on it then for some smaller but still very important improvements on rating 22 is the bone package management with this you can select and manage multiple packages at once really useful they also added support for the USC found format this apparently really widely used in many Industries addressables now gives you a addressable build Report with this you can identify how the asset bundles are being created for code they are updating.net migrating to Microsoft's course CLR as well as continue the improvements to enter play mode faster there are also unifying their existing asynchronous code base making it to use the regular csharp async await keywords you can already see this unification in action in all of the ugs tools like the 11 really they already use async await in similar ways the input system continues getting updates in the future they are working on streamlining the getting started process the memory profiler is now a verified package ey tonkit got a bunch more upgrades including a really awesome sample that is already out as well as some more search improvements including searching through rightclick menus and a whole bunch more so Unity truly is massive nowadays so many areas so many use cases it's impossible to cover everything that everything is doing but this roadmap really shows you the scale of the engine there are so many things already out and so many still to come in every area one very important thing that was absent from the road map was actually announced literally on that very same day was yinty AI this is an extremely important topic so I'm actually going to cover this in a separate dedicated video I want to do that because I imagine tons of people are going to be looking for info specifically on the anti AI so I want to separate that from the general roadmap and GDC recap but for now I can say that the response has been premixed and most of it actually for a very good reason since it's extremely light on details but I can also say that Unity had an exclusive session where they showed us the tools that they're working on and what are their goals and getting principles with unity alley and based on what I've seen I would say that the team is very much on the right track they are very focused on doing it ethically and correctly it's all behind NDA so I can't say too much but I'm going to cover that in a bit more detail in the next video they also have a signup form I've Linked In the description so if you want go ahead and sign up and stay tuned for the video later this week one very interesting topic was right at the end it was the ENT q a a basically about a dozen Unity people from all kinds of teams were there ready to answer anything all the questions were extremely varied on all kinds of topics I wrote them all down so here's some quick highlights one of the more important questions was with regards to empty answers if you've ever been there then you know there's a really annoying bug where it replaces the word high with Anonymous which makes so many answers nearly impossible to read a while ago EMT actually planned on doing something pretty dumb they were going to close in the answers and can only remove it from the internet obviously the response from the community was very negative and very intense thankfully unity and listened to that feedback and walked back on their plans so even the answer still exists but it does exist with that bug and a very old very hard to use platform the answer to this is that instead of fixing just that one specific bug they're actually working on upgrading the entire platform itself so rather than just a BandAid they are working on a proper Unity answers platform no details on any timeline but hopefully soon related to feedback someone asked why does ent have so many options there is Discord Reddit forums GitHub threads and many more the answer is that each platform serves a different purpose and personally I very much agree with that answer personally I do not like Discord because I don't have the time for a realtime platform so I can't really use it I much prefer the asynchronous form but tons of people do love Discord so in this case I would definitely say more options is definitely better then someone asked about mixing local and online coop with Nesco for game objects meaning for example have a game where you have two local clients playing in the same session and two more online clients you need to answer that right now it's not really made for that but it is something they are actively working on they're working on abstracting out the netcode layer which would then enable you to create a domain local client someone asks an interesting question on the ENT bug reports and what does won't fix mean the answer is it can actually mean several things it could be there's already a valid workaround or it could be that this specific bug is some of using a different better tool or it could simply be that the number of users affected by it is a tiny number and fixing it would actually require a massive refactor of whatever system it involves and based on that it's simply not worth it to take developers from other projects to fix whatever that bug is one interesting question was with regards to accessibility and what is Unity doing about that their answer is they are in the beginning stages of implementing accessibility options to the UNT editor itself so that everyone can make aims and for game accessibility there is apparently a colorblindness postprocessing sample which you can inspect in the Shader graph samples and if you want to learn more about this topic then they also recommend the website gameaccessibilityguidelines.com then for a twopart question are unity themselves working on some kind of multiplayer multiplatform game the answer to the first part is Unity making a game themselves the answer is no some people always get annoyed at that answer but honestly I can see their point of view their answer is they already use the engine themselves through the various programs they have where they work closely with developers this way they can improve the engine by having a team constantly go out and interact with dozens of unique projects instead of having just a single inhouse team building a single project I definitely wish gigai had continued but I can also see their point of view and the second part of that question is with regards to multiplatform the answer is this is a tricky subject because pretty much everything related to platforms like the console sdks all of that is behind strict NDA so they can't really share any specifics on it but they did mention they are actively working on providing some kind of abstraction and some ways to help you pass certification then someone asked about upgrading a ENT version and how it sucks to be stuck on a known version and doing an upgrade could be too high risk so what to do about that and which version to pick when starting a new project the answer is depending on your death cycle you should choose the version that won't be on LTS by the time you release so for example if you're launching a game in the next six months go ahead and use version 22 which won't be in LTS by then but if you're for example more than a year out then perhaps use version 23 and with regards to upgrades they mentioned that they've been working on simplifying that process and I can definitely confirm that is the case I remember back in the unity five days that upgrading the UNT version really meant fixing tons and tons of bugs whereas nowadays honestly I don't remember the last time that I had issues upgrading I can take a version from Unity 2019 and upgrade it to 22 and everything works fine one thing that could cause issues are the graphics since those have gone through some pretty significant changes over the past few years the answer to that one is check the Apex website and look at the upgrade guides someone asked a question on what resources to help students learn Unity pointed out that there are plenty of courses and tutorials on untl learn they also have tons of resources on resources.dmt.com their free ebooks are especially excellent I've read a bunch of them and they do contain tons of awesome info so that's unt's answer and of course my own answer in terms of learning material is I would suggest browse this Channel or just YouTube in general then there was a high school teacher helping their kids make a punk game using NGO and trying to deploy to webgl but it didn't work the answer is that nope right now webgl does not work with UNT transport the version 1.0 doesn't work on the web because it has no websocket whereas Transformer 2.0 will support it it is currently an experimental and it might be production ready in 2020s so that's a bunch of questions this q a section was pretty great lots of interesting questions including things that I'd never thought to ask about then one thing that happened during GDC was actually the Meetup this was mainly organized by Matt from Game Dev guide and and mark from game maker sungit I then really announced it myself because it was my very first GDC so I had no idea if I was going to be busy watching some talks at that time but I did end up going I was there alongside a bunch of other awesome content creators and tons of people showed up I'm gonna say that I am very much an introvert so I was pretty stressed out about going to a Meetup but thankfully everyone was super nice even though I don't use the camera in my videos there was still a bunch of people that recognized me and said hello it was awesome to meet so many people working on so many interesting unique projects there was someone building a game like Animal Crossing and using my grid system tutorials to make the house furniture system someone was working on a game and needed to learn pathfinding and they used my video to learn the algorithm a bunch of people said they were going through my turnbased strategy course then also spoke to someone who was building an MMO another one working on the Diablo like all in all tons of awesome people working on lots of different projects and everyone was super nice so thank you all to everyone who showed up I hope you had fun meeting myself and all the other content creators if you don't know any of these then go ahead and subscribe to them the Meetup did go really well so hopefully next year let's do this again beyond that since this was my very first GDC everything was so new to me I very much enjoyed walking around the show floor looking out all the awesome things on display there were lots of awesome motion capture suits a bunch of server tools some audio tools lots of AR glasses and tons more companies that I have no idea what they actually do just by looking at the booth I also enjoyed watching the various booths for each country as someone who loves management and simulation games I definitely enjoy the Germany booth there was a section for the ngf awards with tons of awesome Indie Games also some game Publishers which is where I found out the awesome game Dyson Sphere program is actually getting a really nice update soon then it was fun to see both the unity and unreal boo side by side both had some learning sessions to learn how to use the engine a bunch of demos showcasing all kinds of tools and of course Showcases of lots of games built using the engines looking at those really tells you how the engines are just zooms it's all up to the developers to use the tools to make some awesome games Unity had Ship of Fools Undisputed and a bunch of mobile and tablet games then unreal had like a dragon Edition blue protocol and HiFi Rush so both of them really showcase how the engines can be used to build any awesome game you can think of although I would say unreal actually had the better booth for one simple reason they had free cookies and Olive cookies so my suggestion to Unity is definitely add some cookies to the booth next year okay so that's my recap of gdc23 tons of awesome stuff this was a really busy week as always the featuring looks bright lots of great tools and updates already out and more coming in the future stay tuned for tutorials on a bunch of these new tools like for example int friends and leaderboards and stay tuned for the video covering neon TI coming later this week thank you to everyone who came to the Meetup and said hello thank you to Unity for flying me over for my very first CDC thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
