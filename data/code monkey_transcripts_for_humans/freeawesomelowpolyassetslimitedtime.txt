01:20 - pack is excellent if you're a regular
01:22 - viewer of this channel then you've
01:24 - already seen a bunch of these assets i
01:26 - really like this low poly style so i've
01:27 - used them in tons of my videos for
01:29 - example i've used the battle round pack
01:31 - in the third person shooter video i use
01:34 - the fantasy pack in the house building
01:36 - system video then i also use the heist
01:38 - pack in the destruction video as well as
01:41 - some particles from the particle effects
01:43 - pack and in the ambient occlusion video
01:45 - i use the city pack which is one of the
01:47 - free assets so if you've seen those
01:49 - videos and you'd like to check out those
01:50 - assets then this sale is a great
01:52 - opportunity and all the characters in
01:54 - all of these cindy packs have humanoid
01:56 - rigs meaning you can use them with any
01:58 - humanoid animations like for example
02:00 - anything you can grab from miximo as an
02:02 - example over here i've got the city pack
02:05 - so this is the demo scene as you can see
02:07 - it's huge with tons of buildings lots of
02:09 - vehicles lots of props objects just
02:11 - about everything so again this home pack
02:14 - is completely free so that's quite
02:15 - amazing and you can browse all of the
02:17 - project files to see for example over
02:19 - here all the various characters so let's
02:21 - go to a random position
02:23 - and then just click and drag a character
02:25 - there it is as you can see the character
02:27 - already comes with an animated component
02:29 - and importantly it has the avatar
02:31 - assigned so this is the avatar that is
02:33 - included in meshwell so you've got the
02:35 - actual model and inside you've got the
02:36 - avatar this is how you can retarget
02:39 - animations and again you can verify that
02:41 - the character over here on the rig is
02:42 - indeed set as humanoid so then you can
02:45 - go to miximo.com it's a great website
02:47 - for free animations then just select
02:50 - whatever animation you want so let's say
02:52 - this one just click on download
02:54 - for the type select fbx for unity
02:57 - everything else can be pretty standard
02:59 - then you just drop it in your project
03:00 - here it is
03:01 - so you get an fbx and inside you've got
03:03 - the animation so the first thing is just
03:05 - make sure this animation on the rig it
03:07 - is set to humanoid now you can just make
03:09 - an animated controller
03:12 - assign this controller then drag the new
03:14 - animation
03:15 - and yeah there's the animation working

03:19 - so all the characters in all the packs
03:20 - can be used with any animations and of
03:22 - course all the cars can be used with any
03:24 - car controller and all of the buildings
