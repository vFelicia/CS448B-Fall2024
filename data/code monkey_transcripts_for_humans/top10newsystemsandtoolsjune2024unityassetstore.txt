00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI the assur
00:02 - is full of awesome tools and assets to
00:04 - help you make your own games there's
00:05 - more and more awesome stuff coming out
00:06 - every month so in this video let's check
00:08 - out some highlights for June 24th this
00:09 - one is a list of paid systems and tools
00:11 - in the last video I already covered the
00:13 - best free new assets and next one I'll
00:14 - be covering top visuals and effects as
00:16 - always there's links to the ass in the
00:17 - description and as a bonus you can use
00:18 - the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10% off
00:20 - your order and unity is also running a
00:22 - nice sale right now there's a bunch of
00:23 - messes at 35 bucks so for some of these
00:26 - that means that's a pretty deep discount
00:27 - here's the tool for motion matching
00:29 - animation you can make some really
00:30 - awesome mags with this CTI pack maybe
00:32 - pick up this one if you working on a
00:33 - cute game maybe this huge pack with 900
00:36 - low poly weapons or this one with a
00:37 - mountain of customizable characters you
00:39 - can even watch my character
00:40 - customization tutorial or this parkour
00:42 - and climbing system or this really
00:44 - awesome looking alien environment maybe
00:46 - get this nice slow poly monster bundle
00:48 - or a really interesting traffic control
00:49 - system it says here you can get an extra
00:51 - 10% off with this coupon so based on the
00:53 - name I'm guessing this sale is ending
00:55 - this June so there's only a few days
00:56 - left so if you're interested definitely
00:57 - get it quickly oh and there's also a
00:59 - Humble Bundle with with a mountain of
01:00 - realistic stuff some of these are in
01:02 - real assets and some are unity these all
01:04 - have a really nice realistic style
01:06 - you've got towns Islands there's a
01:07 - viking Village a really nice Work Camp a
01:09 - bunch of characters some kind of modular
01:11 - Temple there's tons of props items and
01:14 - so on check it out with the link in the
01:15 - description all right so starting off
01:17 - with an interesting tool that combines
01:18 - splines and decals so usually there are
01:21 - tools that use splines to generate
01:22 - meshes but this one is different it uses
01:24 - spines in order to play some decal decal
01:27 - in case you don't know is basically just
01:28 - projecting an image onto an ex existing
01:30 - geometry so for example that means you
01:32 - can use this to place some dirt directly
01:34 - on top of your road mesh you can place
01:36 - some dirt or for example some Road lines
01:37 - you can also draw some footprints on top
01:39 - of some kind of Sandy environment and of
01:41 - course it's all using the Spain tool
01:43 - which makes it really easy to position
01:44 - it exactly where you want it you can
01:46 - make straight lines make curves all
01:47 - kinds of things so it's a really great
01:49 - combination of two great tools splines
01:51 - and decals next here's a really awesome
01:53 - outline tool now there are actually tons
01:55 - of these but those usually do it the
01:57 - super simple way which really just
01:58 - scales up the model approach works but
02:00 - usually leaves lots of gaps in the
02:02 - corners whereas on this one this asset
02:04 - does not have that issue the outline is
02:06 - really perfect all around the model even
02:08 - on some harsh Corners it looks really
02:09 - great on pretty much any kind of object
02:11 - so if you use an outline effect in your
02:13 - game and you want them to be super high
02:15 - quality then definitely look at this one
02:16 - then here's a super useful tool called
02:18 - mesh extractor I'm pretty sure I covered
02:20 - version 1.0 of this tool in this video
02:22 - series many years ago so version two is
02:24 - out right now this tool does exactly
02:26 - what it says it helps you extract a mesh
02:28 - from another mesh so for example if you
02:30 - have a model with a lamb tied to a pole
02:32 - you can just extract just a lamb if you
02:34 - have a box of apples you can just grab a
02:36 - single Apple so this is one of those
02:38 - helper tools that is actually really
02:39 - useful in many use cases where the
02:41 - assets that you want to use aren't 100%
02:44 - exactly what you need maybe you just
02:45 - need some part of it if you look at the
02:47 - many assets that you already own you
02:49 - will probably see how you already have
02:50 - tons of stuff although some of it might
02:52 - be merged into one mesh with multiple
02:54 - objects so with this you can just
02:55 - extract some piece from it then for a
02:57 - nice UI tool here is a great looking
02:59 - soft mask the built-in mask that un has
03:01 - is only a harsh mask so it's only on or
03:04 - off there's no fade so this tool helps
03:06 - you add that you can add a mess texture
03:07 - and then easily play around with the
03:09 - mask capacity and fall off you can also
03:11 - stack masks one on top of another so you
03:13 - can make some really interesting effects
03:15 - and it also support some text all in all
03:17 - a really useful really neat tool for
03:18 - your UI it gives you quite a lot more
03:20 - control allowing you to make some really
03:22 - interesting uis next if you get
03:24 - frustrated with clicking on scene View
03:26 - and picking the wrong object if so then
03:28 - look at this tool usually what happens
03:30 - is when clicking on an object it selects
03:31 - the LOD instead of the parent object
03:33 - itself that can be quite annoying so
03:35 - this tool helps minimize that problem by
03:37 - helping you select the object you likely
03:39 - wanted to select it has a bunch of rules
03:41 - like selecting the LED group instead of
03:43 - individual lods it can ignore the UI and
03:45 - drain objects and so on and you can also
03:47 - customize it in terms of colors so
03:49 - really nice tool if you're frustrated
03:51 - with object selection this is one of
03:52 - those tools that can definitely help
03:53 - speed up level design by quite a lot
03:56 - then here's another really simple but
03:58 - potentially very useful tool called
03:59 - scene notes it does exactly what it says
04:01 - it lets you place objects in your scene
04:03 - and add some notes to them this can be
04:05 - really useful for doing things like in
04:07 - list of tasks that you still need to do
04:09 - if they are related to something like
04:11 - level design it can be better to add
04:12 - note in the world space itself instead
04:14 - of adding for some kind of task list you
04:16 - can add notes to remind yourself of
04:18 - various things like why you added a
04:20 - certain house on a certain place maybe
04:22 - also a note to display the position that
04:23 - triggers some kind of boss fight so
04:25 - plenty of use cases the notes can have
04:27 - both a short title and a longer
04:29 - description you can create categories to
04:31 - organize your notes and then you can
04:32 - even tag them as start or completed on
04:35 - all really nice simple tool or perhaps
04:37 - you're making something with cameras or
04:38 - photos if so here is a tool to help you
04:40 - get hand and figure tracking definitely
04:42 - a niche tool but if you need this then
04:44 - this looks to be extremely accurate you
04:45 - can create some actual 3D meshes for the
04:48 - hands with the correct position in 3D
04:49 - space or you can just use some basic
04:51 - standard 2D hand shapes this works with
04:53 - a webcam live stream or it can also work
04:56 - with a simple video or some photos you
04:58 - just feed that onto the algorithm and
04:59 - generates the external hand mesh so this
05:01 - could be really great for making some
05:03 - interesting very different games maybe
05:04 - play around with a connect or something
05:06 - like that or you could also make some
05:07 - non-game apps you can use hand shapes to
05:09 - do all kinds of things for example you
05:11 - could create some kind of home
05:12 - automation then set up a camera pointing
05:14 - somewhere and instead of using your
05:15 - voice to control your home you could use
05:17 - some hand signals or perhaps use it to
05:19 - Define some Naruto hand signs so lots of
05:21 - interesting unique ideas to be used with
05:23 - this one this is the windows version and
05:25 - they also have versions for all other
05:26 - platforms next here's another asset that
05:28 - I'm pretty sure I covered the original
05:30 - version before in this series it's
05:31 - diable terrain 2D this one is version
05:33 - 2.0 it does exactly what it says it
05:35 - helps you dig 2D terrains right away it
05:37 - reminds me of playing worms as a kid
05:39 - destroying the terrain in those games
05:41 - was always a lot of fun basically just
05:42 - dig down and call an air strike that was
05:44 - always fun if You' like to make a game
05:46 - kind of like worms if so then this asset
05:48 - would be a really great starting point
05:49 - you can dig anywhere you want in the
05:51 - terrain any shape you want you can dig
05:53 - holes or cut off massive amounts you can
05:55 - also add physics to the remaining parts
05:57 - so if you cut off something from
05:58 - everything else it won't fall down and
06:00 - the terrain of course can have whatever
06:01 - Vision you want so you can dig through
06:03 - dirt Rock grass or really anything next
06:05 - if you're working on a 2d combat game
06:07 - look at this hit system it basically
06:09 - helps you easily place and set up hit
06:11 - boxes specifically how to combine hitbox
06:13 - shapes at various animation points
06:15 - handling hitbox is always a really
06:17 - tricky thing in games you want the hit
06:18 - to only connect if the weapon or the
06:20 - fist or something like that if that one
06:22 - actually touches the enemy so not just
06:24 - in general and of course you also want
06:26 - it to do only on certain parts of the
06:27 - animation like when actually striking
06:29 - and not when for example pulling the
06:31 - fist back so doing all that can be quite
06:33 - tricky so a tool like this one can
06:34 - really help you out you can define
06:36 - various hitboxes to Define when on the
06:38 - animation they show up so maybe for
06:40 - example you have a small hitbox at
06:42 - animation time of something like. 3 and
06:44 - then need a large hitbox at 04 until
06:46 - 10.8 something like that then depending
06:47 - on hit or miss you can spawn some really
06:49 - nice particle effects or if you're
06:51 - working in 3D and you want to build an
06:52 - entire world then look at this tool it's
06:54 - a node based World creator so instead of
06:57 - manually building the terrain piece by
06:58 - piece and setting all textures instead
07:00 - of that you use a node based workflow
07:02 - where each node defines Logic for
07:04 - generating the entire world naturally
07:05 - since it is based on logic it means that
07:07 - you can easily generate super huge
07:09 - worlds basically just keeps reusing the
07:11 - same logic to generate more and more and
07:13 - it also works with live editing meaning
07:14 - as you modify the nodes you can see the
07:16 - results in real time all right so those
07:18 - are my top 10 new tools and systems on
07:19 - the UN assur for June 24 there's link to
07:22 - all in the description and as a bonus
07:23 - you can use the coupon code Mony 10 to
07:24 - get 10% off your order all right hope
07:26 - that's useful check out these videos to
07:28 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
07:30 - patreon supporters for making these
07:32 - videos possible thank you for watching
07:34 - and I'll see you next time
