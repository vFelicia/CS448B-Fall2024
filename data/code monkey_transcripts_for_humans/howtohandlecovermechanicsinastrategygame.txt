00:00 - so as you move your units you can get
00:01 - them behind either no cover or Low cover
00:03 - or High cover the cover basically
00:06 - impacts the hit chance that enemies have
00:08 - to hit you so cating that hit chance is
00:09 - really just some simple math when
00:11 - attacking a Target when cating the
00:12 - accuracy if the target is in some kind
00:14 - of High cover if so then give a big
00:16 - penalty to the accuracy if it's on Low
00:18 - cover just a slight penalty and if there
00:20 - is no cover then no penalty always
00:21 - remember how really a lot of these games
00:23 - are really just about simple
00:24 - calculations the tricky part is really
00:26 - just balancing all these numbers make it
00:27 - a really satisfying experience
