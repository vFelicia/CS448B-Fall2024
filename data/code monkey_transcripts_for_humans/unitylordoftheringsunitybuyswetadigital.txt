00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and for some news unity has just
00:04 - acquired what it digital that is the vfx
00:06 - studio responsible for bringing movies
00:08 - like the lord of the rings and avatar to
00:10 - life with unity buying them that means
00:12 - that you will soon be able to use all
00:13 - the tools that they use to make those
00:15 - movies with those super high fidelity
00:16 - visuals you can see the entire blog post
00:18 - to see all the tools that will soon be
00:20 - available for example one of them is a
00:23 - path razor so for some super realistic
00:25 - lighting then a physics based simulation
00:27 - tool with a bunch of effects water fire
00:29 - smoke and so on
00:30 - then some physically accurate lighting
00:32 - and color then there's a puppet rigging
00:35 - system a bunch of facial tag for facial
00:37 - capture a really interesting one with
00:39 - some tools for hair fur and everything
00:41 - so it supports simulating growth as well
00:43 - as grooming then some world building
00:45 - some vegetation an advanced liquid smoke
00:48 - and fire simulation
00:50 - and tons more for just about everything
00:52 - as you can see most of these have to do
00:53 - with visuals so for me since i'm
00:55 - primarily a programmer i'm not sure if i
00:57 - won't be able to use many of these but
00:59 - if you're an artist then the possibility
01:00 - of accessing all these super high end
01:02 - tools is awesome and perhaps more
01:04 - important than the tools is that they're
01:06 - also buying their entire asset library
01:08 - so these are hyper realistic scan assets
01:10 - with extremely high quality
01:12 - now one thing that unreal has had for
01:14 - quite some time is the quixote mega
01:16 - scans where they have tons and tons of
01:18 - acid scanned directly from real life so
01:20 - this seems like it might be similar to
01:22 - that if they've been building this
01:24 - library for 20-some years and it's bound
01:26 - to be full of awesome assets if you work
01:28 - on hyper-realistic games and this
01:30 - library sounds like it will be extremely
01:31 - useful
01:32 - now this was just announced so there's
01:34 - not much details on this so no idea what
01:36 - the license will be how much it will
01:37 - cost and so on
01:39 - but it does seem really awesome so
01:40 - hopefully there will be some more
01:41 - details by the end of the year now the
01:43 - song purchase is really interesting
01:45 - because until now it's been mainly
01:46 - unreal who were interested in using game
01:49 - engines for movie making whereas unity
01:51 - has been more focused on other things
01:53 - like architecture building automotive
01:55 - and so on but with this purchase clearly
01:57 - they see the unity engine as being very
01:59 - useful for movie making as well the
02:01 - price was 1.6 billion which is a pretty
02:03 - decent amount for a company like unity
02:05 - so they definitely do see unity for
02:07 - movies as a big part of their long-term
02:09 - plan of that means that if you're using
02:11 - unity at all then this news is yet
02:13 - another great news that unity is here to
02:15 - stay for a very long time and it's
02:17 - getting more and more use cases so
02:19 - whatever you learn using the engine
02:21 - won't possibly help you get into movie
02:23 - making or the vfx industry or tons of
02:25 - other things now my question to you is
02:27 - how many of you are working or wouldn't
02:29 - like to work on a game with realistic
02:31 - visuals
02:32 - for me i'm a big fan of the low poly
02:34 - style so when i eventually start working
02:36 - on my next steam game that's probably
02:37 - the sound be going with
02:39 - but if you're a fan of the hyper
02:40 - realistic style then this is great news
02:42 - for you alright so thanks for watching
02:44 - and i'll see you next time
02:55 - [Music]
02:58 - you
