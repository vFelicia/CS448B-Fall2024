00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - here let's check out this gorgeous scene
00:04 - that showcases just how good unity can
00:06 - look
00:06 - this is based on the high definition
00:08 - render pipeline which is all about
00:10 - giving you the absolutely best visuals
00:12 - possible
00:12 - this render pipeline is meant to target
00:14 - consoles and pcs as opposed to the
00:16 - universal render pipeline which is meant
00:18 - for running games on any device
00:20 - with hdrp you can make some extremely
00:22 - realistic stunning looking visuals and
00:24 - all of it based on real world values
00:26 - so if you set your materials cameras and
00:28 - lights with the exact same values as
00:30 - they have in the real world you should
00:31 - get some excellent visuals
00:32 - i've already made a video a while ago
00:34 - introducing agrp
00:36 - in there i talk about how to install it
00:37 - or how to add it to an existing project
00:39 - i go over the various options and tools
00:41 - and everything you can do to make your
00:42 - game look gorgeous
00:44 - check that video linked in the
00:45 - description now this one is the new
00:47 - template that just came out with dnt
00:49 - 2020.2 and it showcased the power of
00:51 - hdrp in three gorgeous scenarios
00:54 - first of all you've got an outside scene
00:56 - lit by the sun
00:57 - then you've got an indoor scene which
00:59 - also has some indoor lights as well as
01:00 - some sunlight
01:01 - and then a completely indoor scene they
01:04 - all look extremely realistic
01:06 - and despite looking so good it is also
01:08 - very performant i've got a geforce 980
01:11 - which is a 5 year old gpu
01:12 - and the scene is running at 80 to 100
01:14 - frames per second so it looks great and
01:16 - plays great
01:17 - now let's explore the scene to see how
01:19 - it works but before we do that
01:21 - this video is sponsored by skillshare
01:23 - skillshare is an online learning

02:18 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
02:20 - video and supporting the channel
02:21 - starting off on the outdoor scene we've
02:23 - got our nice sunroof
02:25 - and over here we've got a really good
02:27 - looking unity sphere
02:28 - so you can really zoom in and see just
02:30 - how much detail it has
02:32 - so it's got some roughness normals looks
02:34 - very metallic and has a really nice
02:36 - shine
02:37 - and it all interacts perfectly with the
02:38 - outdoor light which is just a standard
02:40 - directional light
02:41 - on the scene you can inspect everything
02:43 - so you can click directly on the wall
02:44 - and over here see all the various
02:46 - materials and as you can see it's using
02:47 - the standard hdrp inlet shader
02:50 - so over here you see tons and tons of
02:52 - options this is just how detailed agrp
02:54 - can be
02:55 - so you don't need any complex custom
02:57 - made shaders you can use the standard
02:59 - hdrp only shader and everything looks
03:01 - gorgeous
03:02 - so you've got the sphere and then this
03:03 - whole thing is lit by the directional
03:05 - light
03:06 - so you can select it and see how it's
03:07 - set up and you can see how it's defined
03:09 - by temperature and intensity
03:11 - just the same as in real world values so
03:13 - over here you've got a certain
03:14 - temperature you can make the sunlight a
03:16 - bit colder or warmer
03:17 - you can play around the intensity and so
03:19 - on then on the camera itself you also
03:21 - have a lot of physical values
03:23 - so here if you expand this yep there you
03:25 - go so you can play around with sensor
03:26 - size iso shutter speed and so on so like
03:28 - i mentioned before if you have a
03:30 - knowledge of photography in the real
03:31 - world you can really apply that same
03:33 - knowledge right here
03:34 - then on the scene view if you're looking
03:35 - like this it looks all very clean but
03:37 - you can toggle gizmos and yep now you
03:39 - see everything that makes up this
03:40 - gorgeous scene
03:41 - so one of the things that you see you
03:43 - see tons of decals in order to make the
03:44 - scene look really alive
03:46 - if you select on decals and manually
03:48 - enable and disable them you can see the
03:50 - huge difference
03:51 - there's tons of them placed all the way
03:53 - throughout the level in order to make
03:54 - the scene look more natural and if you
03:55 - disable them it looks a bit too perfect
03:58 - so this is using just the standard decom
03:59 - projector and in the hierarchy you can
04:02 - also see and select the
04:03 - light probe and see how you have light
04:04 - probes all the way throughout this level
04:07 - as well as the same thing for a whole
04:08 - bunch of reflection pros
04:10 - so right here we've got a reflection
04:11 - probe for the outside another one for
04:13 - inside and so
04:14 - on okay so this is the outdoor scene
04:16 - looking really gorgeous
04:18 - then as we go inside we come across my
04:20 - favorite scene
04:22 - so this is a really good looking scene
04:24 - combining both indoor and outdoor
04:25 - lighting
04:26 - and it's got a really nice plant in case
04:28 - nonetheless so
04:29 - right away you can see some gorgeous
04:31 - volumetric light so look at that looking
04:33 - really good
04:34 - then you can see some particles made
04:36 - with vfx wraps so look at those
04:37 - butterflies yep those are particles
04:39 - you can also see a whole bunch of dust
04:41 - scattered throughout in here
04:42 - and then you've got examples of
04:43 - real-world materials so you've got some
04:45 - glass as well as some metal
04:47 - and by the way if you find the video
04:49 - helpful consider subscribing and hitting
04:50 - the like button
04:51 - it really helps out the channel once
04:53 - again we can pause the scene to inspect
04:55 - the whole thing
04:56 - so you can see over here it's using this
04:58 - glass material so you can pretty much
05:00 - just copy paste this material and use it
05:02 - in your own games
05:03 - then you also got the frame which has a
05:04 - metal black material
05:06 - and pretty much everywhere you look you
05:07 - can see some gorgeous lighting so if you
05:09 - look up here yep you can see
05:10 - just perfect lighting so it's perfectly
05:13 - complicating all the light some of the
05:14 - light bounces that come from outside
05:16 - bounce down there and end up in there if
05:18 - we enable gizmos we can see everything
05:20 - so you can see the sunlight comes from
05:21 - there then over here all of these ones
05:23 - each individual one has the sunlight
05:25 - so you can see it's using a spotlight
05:27 - and here you've got a mix
05:28 - of real world lights and baking lights
05:31 - so to see the lighting settings you can
05:32 - go into window
05:34 - go into rendering and lighting and here
05:36 - you can inspect all the settings that
05:38 - they use to make this whole thing look
05:39 - so gorgeous
05:40 - so you got tons of indirect samples and
05:42 - some direct samples
05:44 - then you also have some environment
05:45 - light and over here you can see all of
05:47 - the big light maps
05:48 - and just another lighting relating thing
05:50 - if you go into window rendering here
05:52 - you've got the light explorer
05:54 - and this one shows you all the lights in
05:55 - the scene as well as all of their
05:57 - parameters
05:58 - so here you see all their cold
05:59 - temperature the intensity the range and
06:01 - so on
06:01 - and as i mentioned previously we also
06:03 - got some really good looking particles
06:05 - here
06:06 - so look at this butterfly there they are
06:08 - all the butterflies just flying around
06:10 - and if they are particles and they are
06:12 - built using the vfx graph
06:14 - so you can just double click and edit it
06:16 - and up here you can see the whole graph
06:18 - see how it works and everything now i've
06:20 - already covered the basics for the vfx
06:22 - graph in another video so go check that
06:23 - out if you want to see how it works
06:25 - but yep you can just take this and
06:26 - pretty much copy paste and use it in
06:28 - your own projects so you've got the
06:29 - spawn initialize the particle you update
06:31 - the particle and then some output
06:33 - so you've got these really good looking
06:35 - butterflies then you also have some
06:37 - falling leaves
06:38 - and then here you also have just a whole
06:40 - bunch of dust so when you put all of
06:42 - that together you end up with this
06:44 - really awesome scene
06:45 - looking really really good then
06:46 - afterwards we go into our full indoor
06:49 - scene
06:49 - and by the way here we also see the
06:50 - transition so tons of exposure so it's
06:53 - really wide and then as we go in yep it
06:55 - automatically updates
06:56 - so the exposure transitions from really
06:58 - bright to really dark and then
07:00 - updates now that is done using a volume
07:03 - since again if you look in the hierarchy
07:05 - you can find all the volumes
07:06 - so right here you've got the volumes and
07:08 - if we turn on the gizmos we can see
07:10 - so you've got this volume here on the
07:12 - corridor this is a local volume with a
07:14 - certain plant distance
07:15 - and it's modifying the exposure and then
07:17 - outside here we've got the skylight with
07:19 - a different exposure
07:20 - so you can see on all the volumes all
07:21 - the various post-processing effects that
07:23 - they have
07:24 - and on the global volume you can see all
07:26 - the base ones so you can see screen
07:27 - space reflections film grain motion blur
07:29 - you got some bloom really nice
07:31 - some ambient collision a bunch of fog
07:33 - exposure tone mapping and so on
07:35 - all right so here we go into our fully
07:38 - indoor scene
07:39 - so the outside light the outside
07:41 - sunlight is not affecting this scene at
07:43 - all it's only lit by these local lights
07:46 - and up there you also have an emission
07:48 - light here you can inspect the material
07:50 - inside it's using the curve wall and up
07:52 - here it's using an emissive light strip
07:54 - and it simply has some emission so
07:57 - that's that light
07:58 - then on the other side you also see a
08:00 - whole bunch of lights
08:01 - so these are standard spotlights and you
08:04 - can also see that they are also using a
08:05 - light cookie right in here
08:07 - so as i move yep you can see it move
08:09 - around so it looks really good
08:11 - so all that looks really great and we
08:13 - also got a smaller nice unity sphere
08:15 - and then over here we've got another
08:17 - scene so just nice chair and a whole
08:19 - bunch of lights
08:20 - so this is a great example of a fully
08:22 - indoor only scene so there's no
08:24 - directional light in here on all the
08:25 - directional light stops right in there
08:27 - alright so this is the new hdrp template
08:30 - as you can see unity is definitely
08:32 - capable of making some really gorgeous
08:33 - graphics
08:34 - to play around with it for yourself just
08:36 - go ahead create a new project using
08:37 - unity 20.2
08:39 - and select the agrp template so this is
08:41 - a great showcase to demonstrate just how
08:43 - good unt can look
08:44 - you have all of these tools at your
08:46 - disposal all the shaders volumes and
08:48 - lights
08:48 - and it's up to you to put them all
08:49 - together and create something awesome
08:51 - if you found the video helpful consider
08:53 - liking and subscribing don't forget for

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey here let's check out this gorgeous scene that showcases just how good unity can look this is based on the high definition render pipeline which is all about giving you the absolutely best visuals possible this render pipeline is meant to target consoles and pcs as opposed to the universal render pipeline which is meant for running games on any device with hdrp you can make some extremely realistic stunning looking visuals and all of it based on real world values so if you set your materials cameras and lights with the exact same values as they have in the real world you should get some excellent visuals i've already made a video a while ago introducing agrp in there i talk about how to install it or how to add it to an existing project i go over the various options and tools and everything you can do to make your game look gorgeous check that video linked in the description now this one is the new template that just came out with dnt 2020.2 and it showcased the power of hdrp in three gorgeous scenarios first of all you've got an outside scene lit by the sun then you've got an indoor scene which also has some indoor lights as well as some sunlight and then a completely indoor scene they all look extremely realistic and despite looking so good it is also very performant i've got a geforce 980 which is a 5 year old gpu and the scene is running at 80 to 100 frames per second so it looks great and plays great now let's explore the scene to see how it works but before we do that this video is sponsored by skillshare skillshare is an

we've got our nice sunroof and over here we've got a really good looking unity sphere so you can really zoom in and see just how much detail it has so it's got some roughness normals looks very

games then you also got the frame which has a metal black material and pretty much everywhere you look you can see some gorgeous lighting so if you look up here yep you can see just perfect lighting so it's perfectly complicating all the light some of the light bounces that come from outside bounce down there and end up in there if we enable gizmos we can see everything so you can see the sunlight comes from there then over here all of these ones each individual one has the sunlight so you can see it's using a spotlight and here you've got a mix of real world lights and baking lights so to see the lighting settings you can go into window go into rendering and lighting and here you can inspect all the settings that they use to make this whole thing look so gorgeous so you got tons

rendering here you've got the light explorer and this one shows you all the lights in the scene as well as all of their parameters so here you see all their cold temperature the intensity the range and so on and as i mentioned previously we also got some really good looking particles here so look at this butterfly there they are all the butterflies just flying around and if they are particles
