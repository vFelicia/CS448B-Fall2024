00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - create a graph in unity we're going to
00:05 - add some buttons to manually modify our
00:07 - graph let's begin
00:11 - so I have my graph here and it is
00:13 - showing some values and changing the
00:15 - visual types now let's add some buttons
00:17 - to be able to manually select what
00:19 - visual type we want so let's go into the
00:21 - editor onto the UI on to the window
00:24 - graph let's start off by creating a new
00:26 - button so create an empty game object
00:28 - and let's name this bar chart but let's
00:32 - add an image for the background so UI
00:35 - image this will be our background and
00:39 - let's add another one for our icon so
00:41 - the background make it in black and like
00:44 - that for the icon I have an icon here
00:47 - for the bar chart icon let's make the
00:50 - size a bit smaller and like that okay
00:53 - this is our button now let's add the
00:55 - button you are a script the script is
00:57 - part of the code monkey Tonys that you
00:59 - can grab for free from unity code monkey
01:01 - calm this script helps me count your
01:03 - mouse events on this particular game
01:05 - object so for example I have the hover
01:07 - behavior type I'm going to set it to
01:09 - change color I want to change the icon
01:12 - color when it's normal let's leave it on
01:15 - pure white and when the mouse is over
01:17 - let's make it tinted in green
01:19 - alright let's position our button in
01:21 - this corner in here now let's duplicate
01:24 - it and this won't be the line graph
01:27 - button and let's change the icon for the
01:30 - in line graph icon and keep everything
01:33 - else the same
01:33 - we still got B button UI changing the
01:36 - color on mouse-over
01:37 - okay so that our buttons are setup and
01:40 - let's go to the code so here on D code
01:42 - let's go and find the reference for our
01:46 - buttons so that's on the transform fine
01:48 - and we call the first 1 bar chart button
01:51 - and get the components of type button UI
01:55 - and on the click func which is a
01:58 - function triggered when clicked on the
02:00 - button it will execute this action and
02:03 - this action won't do something so now we
02:06 - need to make a function that only takes
02:08 - a visual type and keeps the exact same
02:10 - values so in order to do that we need to
02:12 - first cache all the values that were
02:13 - used on last time this function was
02:15 - called so let's set up some member
02:17 - variables to store all this
02:28 - okay so we now have member variables to
02:30 - cache the values that were used on the
02:33 - last time the function was cone
02:34 - so now let's store them in here so let's
02:38 - store this top value list equals our
02:40 - felon list and do the same for all the
02:42 - others now for the max visible mount
02:48 - we're going to store it after validating
02:50 - it which will make it easier to change
02:52 - afterwards so we are now storing the
02:54 - values whenever the function is called
02:56 - that means we can now go here and make
02:58 - another function that will only receive
03:01 - the graph visual so a private void sat
03:04 - graph visual and inside we're going to
03:07 - receive a parameter of type I graphed
03:09 - visual graphic visual okay and we're
03:12 - going to call the show where a function
03:14 - using our cached values so the value
03:17 - list then we're going to use this graph
03:19 - visual so now to keep things clean let's
03:21 - use this stuff the only stuff that and
03:23 - this starts max visible and so on okay
03:28 - so we can now use this function to only
03:30 - modify the graph visual so that's what
03:32 - we're going to call up here when you got
03:34 - the bar chart button then we're going to
03:36 - call set the graph visual using our bar
03:39 - chart visual and then we have the button
03:42 - for the line graph button which won't
03:46 - set it to the line graph visual all
03:48 - right
03:49 - so let's test all right so here's our
03:51 - graph being displayed as a bar chart our
03:54 - buttons as you can see the column
03:55 - changes on mouse-over so that's very
03:57 - nice
03:57 - hey now if I click on the line graph yep
04:00 - there you go we change to use the in
04:01 - line graphical and again click back and
04:03 - I can swap back and forth great so we
04:06 - can now manually change the visual
04:07 - representation of our graph now let's
04:10 - set up some buttons to change the
04:11 - visible amount so back in the editor in
04:14 - here let's duplicate this and add
04:16 - another button on the side for this one
04:18 - let's call it decrease the visible
04:21 - amount button and on the right side
04:23 - we're going to have a increase visible
04:26 - amount button so let's set the icons a
04:29 - minus icon and a plus icon
04:32 - okay now let's have to the code and in
04:35 - here let's also capture those buttons so
04:37 - first of all the decrease visible amount
04:40 - button which will do something different
04:43 - from this and then we have the increase
04:46 - visible amount button so now we need
04:50 - functions to increase and decrease the
04:52 - visible amount so it's going here and
04:54 - make a private boy first of all let's
04:56 - see the increase the visible amount and
05:01 - inside we're just going to call the main
05:03 - function so again show brown I'm going
05:06 - to show it using this dot val enlist
05:07 - this not graph visual and then for the
05:10 - max visible mount use this dot max
05:13 - visible mount and since we are
05:14 - increasing then increase it by one then
05:17 - again this target axis label X and the y
05:20 - alright now let's copy this and make the
05:23 - decrease the visible amount instead of
05:27 - increasing by one we decrease it by one
05:29 - okay
05:29 - now up here let's call these functions
05:32 - so on the increase call the increase on
05:34 - decrease called the decrease alright
05:36 - let's test the code okay there we go
05:39 - it is currently showing all of the
05:40 - values in our graph so if I hit - yup
05:44 - there you go it starts off at day two
05:45 - goes until day 15 and I can do it do it
05:48 - and again it is only showing the last
05:50 - six days on our graph and I can also
05:53 - increase and it goes until it shows the
05:56 - entire thing so we cannot modify the max
05:59 - visible amount so now let's finish it by
06:01 - adding functions to modify the M labels
06:03 - so in here let's make a function to set
06:06 - the label for the X into y so first of
06:09 - all a private void set get axis label X
06:13 - and in here we're going to receive or
06:16 - we're using for the label X so it's
06:18 - exactly same thing in here and we're
06:21 - going to call very much the same as in
06:24 - here call using the cash the values
06:26 - instead of using this not get access and
06:28 - label X use the one called in this
06:31 - function then do another function to
06:33 - modify the y
06:37 - okay so we now have two functions to
06:39 - modify the axis labels so now let's go
06:42 - into the editor in here we're going to
06:45 - make two buttons for swapping let's say
06:47 - between dollars and euros so let's
06:49 - duplicate it here let's say the dollar
06:52 - button and on the right side we have the
06:56 - euro button set the icons ok our buttons
07:00 - are set up now in our code let's go up
07:03 - here we have the references so first we
07:06 - have the dollar button and then we have
07:10 - the euro button we're going to use the
07:14 - set gap X's and label Y we're going to
07:17 - leave the X as is and someone is showing
07:20 - the day so leave that one we're going to
07:22 - modify the Y and for the dollar we're
07:24 - essentially going to send the same
07:25 - function that we're using so this one
07:28 - which takes a float and returns the
07:30 - dollar sign and then it rounds off the
07:32 - value in that white position and then
07:34 - for the Euro
07:36 - let's show as euros and we're going to
07:39 - take the value and divide it by an
07:42 - exchange rate so let's say 1.18 app and
07:45 - then round out the whole thing
07:46 - alright so let's test okay here's the
07:49 - graph here you can see all the values on
07:51 - our y-axis and if I click on dollar
07:54 - nothing changes son says the exact same
07:56 - thing and on euro and yep there you go
07:59 - everything was converted into euros so
08:01 - in here you see dollars and euros so we
08:03 - can easily swap our labels and we could
08:06 - if we want to do the same thing on the
08:08 - x-axis all the other buttons don't work
08:10 - so we can show one less values or show
08:13 - them all so and we can still swap
08:16 - between the line graph and bar charts so
08:18 - there you have it we took our graph and
08:19 - added some buttons to manually modify
08:21 - how our data is displayed in the graph
08:23 - in the next video we're going to add
08:25 - some tooltips to display the exact value
08:27 - of each data point as always you can
08:29 - download the project files in utilities
08:31 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
08:33 - any questions post them in the comments
08:34 - and I'll do my best answer them
08:35 - subscribe for more videos and I'll see
08:37 - you next time

hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're continuing to create a graph in unity we're going to add some buttons to manually modify our graph let's begin so I have my graph here and it is showing some values and changing the visual types now let's add some buttons to be able to manually select what visual type we want so let's go into the editor onto the UI on to the window graph let's start off by creating a new button so create an empty game object and let's name this bar chart but let's add an image for the background so UI image this will be our background and let's add another one for our icon so the background make it in black and like that for the icon I have an icon here for the bar chart icon let's make the size a bit smaller and like that okay this is our button now let's add the button you are a script the script is part of the code monkey Tonys that you can grab for free from unity code monkey calm this script helps me count your mouse events on this particular game object so for example I have the hover behavior type I'm going to set it to change color I want to change the icon color when it's normal let's leave it on pure white and when the mouse is over let's make it tinted in green alright let's position our button in this corner in here now let's duplicate it and this won't be the line graph button and let's change the icon for the in line graph icon and keep everything else the same we still got B button UI changing the color on mouseover okay so that our buttons are setup and let's go to the code so here on D code let's go and find the reference for our buttons so that's on the transform fine and we call the first 1 bar chart button and get the components of type button UI and on the click func which is a function triggered when clicked on the button it will execute this action and this action won't do something so now we need to make a function that only takes a visual type and keeps the exact same values so in order to

max visible mount we're going to store it after validating it which will make it easier to change afterwards so we are now storing the values whenever the function is called that means we can now go here and make another function that will only receive the graph visual so a private void sat graph visual and inside we're going to receive a parameter of type I graphed visual graphic visual okay and we're going to call the show where a function using our cached values so the value list then we're going to use this graph visual so now to keep things clean let's use this stuff the only stuff that and this starts max visible and so on okay so we can now use this function to only modify the graph visual so that's what we're going to call up here when you got the bar chart button then we're going to call set the graph visual using our bar chart visual and then we have the button for the line graph button which won't set it to the line graph visual all right so let's test all right so here's our graph being displayed as a bar chart our buttons as you can see the column changes on mouseover so that's very nice hey now if I click on the line graph yep there you go we change to use the in line graphical and again click back and I can swap back and forth great so we can now manually change the visual representation of our graph now let's set up some buttons to change the visible amount so back in the editor in here let's duplicate this and add another button on the side for this one let's call it decrease the visible amount button and on the right side we're going to have a increase visible amount button so let's set the icons a minus icon and a plus icon okay now let's have to the code and in here let's also capture those buttons so first of all the decrease visible amount button which will do something different from this and then we have the increase visible amount button so now we need functions to increase and decrease the visible amount so it's going here and make a private boy first of all let's see the increase the visible amount and inside we're just going to call the main function so again show brown I'm going to show it using this dot val enlist this not graph visual and then for the max visible mount use this dot max visible mount and since we are increasing then increase it by one then again this target axis label X and the y alright now let's copy this and make the decrease the visible amount instead of increasing by one we decrease it by one okay now up here let's call these functions so on the increase call the increase on decrease called the decrease alright let's test the code okay there we go it is currently showing all of the values in our graph so if I hit yup there you go it starts off at day two goes until day 15 and I can do it do it and again it is only showing the last six days on our graph and I can also increase and it goes until it shows the entire thing so we cannot modify the max visible amount so now let's finish it by adding functions to modify the M labels so in here let's make a function to set the label for the X into y so first of all a private void set get axis label X and in here we're going to receive or we're using for the label X so it's exactly same thing in here and we're going to call very much the same as in here call using the cash the values instead of using this not get access and label X use the one called in this function then do another function to modify the y okay so we now have two functions to modify the axis labels so now let's go into the editor in here we're going to make two buttons for swapping let's say between dollars and euros so let's duplicate it here let's say the dollar button and on the right side we have the euro button set the icons ok our buttons are set up now in our code let's go up here we have the references so first we have the dollar button and then we have the euro button we're going to use the set gap X's and label Y we're going to leave the X as is and someone is showing the day so leave that one we're going to modify the Y and for the dollar we're essentially going to send the same function that we're using so this one which takes a float and returns the dollar sign and then it rounds off the value in that white position and then for the Euro let's show as euros and we're going to take the value and divide it by an exchange rate so

exact same thing and on euro and yep there you go everything was converted into euros so in here you see dollars and euros so we can easily swap our labels and we could if we want to do the same thing on the xaxis all the other buttons don't work so we can show one less values or show them all so and we can still swap between the line graph and bar charts so there you have it we took our graph and added some buttons to manually modify how our data is displayed in the graph in the next video we're going to add some tooltips to display the exact value of each data point as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
