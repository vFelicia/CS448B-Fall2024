00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - so a while ago I made a video talking
00:04 - about an excellent indie game called
00:05 - punch a bunch that just released and
00:07 - found massive success by my estimates
00:09 - it's owned about 13 000 copies in just
00:11 - two weeks making about 200 000 in
00:14 - Revenue that's a huge hit really awesome
00:16 - but recently I also launched my own
00:18 - steam game and results are very much a
00:20 - family with almost zero players so the
00:22 - big question is what is the big
00:23 - difference between these two games now I
00:25 - should point out that I'm using the word
00:27 - failure here with some very very heavy
00:29 - quotation marks the game that I'm
00:30 - talking about is Kitchen chaos this is
00:32 - the game that was fully built in my free
00:34 - complete course I added it to seem just
00:36 - for fun just make it easier for people
00:37 - who wanted to easily play the final game
00:39 - before starting the course so I wasn't
00:41 - really trying to make this a successful
00:43 - launch or anything so that is why it's
00:44 - not really a failure at all like I
00:46 - mentioned in the video is game devluck
00:48 - success means different things to
00:49 - different people so for this specific
00:51 - game I didn't add it to steam with the
00:53 - hopes of getting thousands of downloads
00:54 - I added it just for fun so based on my
00:56 - goals it actually was successful but
00:58 - still this is an excellent data point to
01:00 - end analyze how Sim releases can do how
01:02 - one game can launch and sell 10 000
01:04 - copies while another one gets almost
01:05 - zero now if you're a regular on this
01:07 - channel you've heard me mention
01:08 - repeatedly the importance of wishlists
01:10 - you might be sick of hearing me talk
01:11 - about it but the reason why I mentioned
01:13 - it so often is exactly because of this
01:14 - it is so extremely important these two
01:16 - games are the perfect example of that
01:18 - for punch a bunch the game was developed
01:20 - over three years and all that time he
01:22 - made tons of devlogs which helped him
01:24 - gather around 20 000 wishlists by the
01:26 - time the game launched because of that
01:28 - as soon as the game was released a bunch
01:30 - of people got some steam notifications
01:31 - that the game was out then some of those
01:33 - people bought it then steam saw that the
01:34 - game was selling and showed it to more
01:36 - people and so on and on so those
01:38 - wishlists helped it get a successful
01:39 - launch whereas for my game I made this
01:42 - theme page quickly as I was building the
01:43 - course at the same time then I made it
01:45 - public and I launched the game when the
01:47 - course video went live which was pretty
01:48 - much as quickly as I could launch it
01:49 - seem requires you to have the coming
01:51 - soon page visible for two weeks before
01:53 - launching and that's exactly how long it
01:54 - was visible I think I just mentioned it
01:56 - in a single video and during a live
01:58 - stream before release so the result on
02:00 - this game launched with just 600
02:01 - wishlists that is a tiny tiny amount for
02:04 - contacts usually if you want to find
02:06 - success then the bare minimum you should
02:07 - have is at the very least 5000 a better
02:10 - amount is at least 10 000. those are the
02:12 - goals that I set for my proper steam
02:13 - game tournament Liberation so for
02:15 - kitchen chaos with under a thousand
02:16 - wishlists that is essentially zero wish
02:18 - list which in turn means almost no one
02:20 - was notified when the game was released
02:21 - and in turn no one picked it up which
02:23 - means the same algorithm really just
02:25 - ignored the game again let me point out
02:27 - that for this game I didn't have the
02:28 - goal of making this a steam success or
02:30 - anything so I'm personally okay with the
02:31 - result I wasn't expecting anything
02:33 - different but the lesson to you is
02:35 - imagine that instead of having the goal
02:36 - of just putting it on scene for fun
02:38 - imagine that I had worked on this game
02:40 - for two years and I was hoping it would
02:42 - sell tons of copies if there were the
02:43 - case then this would be a catastrophic
02:45 - failure so if you make a game and you
02:47 - work on it really hard for a real long
02:49 - time with the hopes of finding success
02:50 - if you ignore my advice and ignore
02:52 - marketing and don't get a wishlist or
02:54 - tell anything about your game if you do
02:56 - that and you suddenly launch the game if
02:57 - you do then this is what will happen no
02:59 - one will know that your game exists no
03:01 - one won't buy it and no one won't play
03:03 - it so if you don't want that to happen
03:04 - with your games then I would highly
03:06 - highly encourage you to listen to my
03:07 - advice watch my video on the most
03:09 - important skill start studying about
03:10 - marketing start Gathering some wishlists
03:12 - through whatever method you can find so
03:14 - that hopefully when your game final
03:16 - launches you actually find the success
03:17 - that you're after I should also point
03:19 - out that part of marketing is choosing a
03:21 - good idea that is marketable and
03:22 - interesting the main reason this game
03:24 - didn't find success is indeed because of
03:26 - lack of wishlist but a second equally
03:28 - important reason is that the game is
03:30 - really nothing special now obviously
03:31 - that's intentional this was a game made
03:33 - permanently for a course so it was
03:35 - intentionally made to be simple and
03:36 - generic but obviously in your own games
03:38 - you don't want that one extremely
03:39 - important video that I mentioned in the
03:41 - marketing video is won by Ryan Clark
03:42 - it's an excellent video all about
03:44 - finding good hooks definitely watch that
03:46 - to validate that your idea is actually
03:48 - marketable having a marketable idea
03:50 - makes marketing a whole lot simpler so
03:52 - if your goal only still finds success as
03:53 - an indie Dev don't do what I did with
03:55 - this quick game instead pick a good idea
03:58 - and start Gathering wishlist as soon as
03:59 - you can if you do that then like I said
04:01 - in the Game Dev Vlog video I believe
04:03 - that success can be achieved also let me
04:05 - take this time to listen to my own
04:06 - advice so let me mention my proper steam
04:08 - game that I'm working on with the hope
04:10 - that it does find success it's called
04:11 - turnover Liberation it's an interesting
04:13 - mix of genres with turn-based strategy
04:15 - automation crafting resource Gathering
04:17 - and so on check it out to the link
04:18 - description and add it to your wishlist
04:19 - alright hope that's useful check out
04:22 - these videos to learn some more thanks
04:24 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
04:26 - making these videos possible thank you
04:28 - for watching and I'll see you next time
