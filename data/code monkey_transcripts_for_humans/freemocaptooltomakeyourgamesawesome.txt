00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - normally doing moap animation is
00:03 - something that requires lots of money
00:05 - and tons of equipment however here let's
00:07 - see a tool called anim motive that lets
00:09 - you record map animations of very high
00:11 - quality although this is also so much
00:12 - more than just a map animation tool you
00:14 - can create fullon Cuts scenes or short
00:16 - films basically you can set up a world
00:19 - then you can play some lights play some
00:20 - cameras and position them exactly where
00:22 - you want them just like you would in a
00:23 - normal film set then you can use some
00:26 - props you can write the script and just
00:27 - act the way you act is you literally
00:29 - embody the characters that you place on
00:31 - the scene and then move and talk and do
00:33 - whatever you want you can have a
00:34 - director control the camera movement or
00:36 - swap between cameras you can also
00:38 - control an invisible character and do
00:39 - some really cool handheld camera
00:41 - movement you can make animations with
00:43 - multiple characters like two people
00:44 - talking to each other or an attacker and
00:46 - Defender animations so for example you
00:48 - record one character then cut move to
00:51 - the other character and record some more
00:53 - this makes the final animation be
00:54 - perfectly sync or you can do all this in
00:56 - collaboration with other people in real
00:58 - time either in a shared VR space where
01:00 - everyone is in VR or just some people in
01:02 - VR like just the actors and have the
01:04 - others on a regular desktop like
01:06 - director then you can either render
01:07 - video from what all the camera see or
01:10 - export this animation onto an fpx file
01:12 - which you can then load inside blender
01:14 - or unity and use in any way you want
01:16 - this is a really awesome tool I
01:17 - definitely enjoyed my time playing with
01:19 - it this video is sponsored by anim
01:21 - motive but I wouldn't do a sponsored
01:23 - video if I didn't think this human was
01:24 - generally awesome so I do think this is
01:26 - great and extremely useful especially
01:28 - for Indie devs while also being being
01:30 - completely free to try out so after
01:31 - watching this video definitely go ahead
01:33 - check the link in the description to go
01:34 - try it out like I said this has a ton of
01:37 - use cases I'll go through a bunch of
01:39 - them in the ways that I think can help
01:40 - you make your own games and then I'll
01:42 - also do a quick getting started tutorial
01:44 - it's actually surprisingly easy to get
01:45 - started now as an in developer the main
01:47 - use case that I thought of right away
01:48 - was just quickly making some very custom
01:50 - animations nowadays the accur is really
01:53 - awesome you can very quickly very easily
01:55 - find tons of animations however they
01:57 - usually come in some really huge pack
01:58 - and not as individual animations so if
02:00 - you need just one very specific thing
02:02 - like just a simple hand wve picking up a
02:05 - giant pack with 100 animation just to
02:07 - get the one you want and hope that it's
02:08 - exactly as you want that can be quite
02:10 - annoying quite timec consuming so
02:11 - instead in just 60 seconds you can pick
02:13 - up your headset and easily record the
02:15 - exact animation you want so this tool is
02:17 - really excellent for helping you speed
02:18 - up iteration time which as a need Dev is
02:21 - definitely one of the most valuable
02:22 - things you have or another use case is
02:24 - for making some super custom animations
02:26 - like for example if you have a character
02:28 - sitting at a desk working on a computer
02:29 - most animation packs are really for
02:31 - things like attacks and movement
02:32 - animations so finding an animation for
02:35 - something very specific like just
02:36 - working on a computer that is actually
02:38 - quite tricky again you can very quickly
02:40 - just put on a headset and record the
02:42 - exact animation you want it can be
02:43 - working on a computer it can be eating a
02:45 - burger doing some fancy ninja moves
02:48 - maybe some bicep curls shooting a spider
02:50 - web from the wrist pulling a simple
02:52 - lever hammering a nail and so on finding
02:54 - animation packs for such unique
02:56 - animations is actually really hard but
02:58 - in 60 seconds you can really just put on
03:00 - the headset and create the exact
03:01 - animation you want very easily then of
03:03 - course you can just export and import it
03:05 - into Unity or blender if you want to
03:07 - tweak something another excellent use
03:08 - case for recording multiple character
03:10 - animations now this one is really
03:12 - especially cool for me I'm a Sol
03:14 - developer I work just by myself so the
03:16 - ability to do Moab to create animations
03:18 - that involve multiple characters and do
03:20 - that just by myself is really awesome
03:22 - for example something super simple just
03:24 - making two characters talk to one
03:25 - another I can just Place both characters
03:27 - in the scene then I can body the first
03:29 - character and record the animation then
03:31 - stop recording embody the second
03:33 - character record again and yep now this
03:35 - records both animations at the exact
03:36 - same time I'm really amazed at how well
03:38 - this workflow works even when it's just
03:41 - a single developer jumping back and
03:42 - forth another example something that is
03:44 - usually pretty tricky is doing attacker
03:46 - and Defender animations basically
03:48 - attacks that involve two characters
03:49 - usually that's really tricky to sync in
03:51 - order to make sure that the attack and
03:52 - Defender act at the exact same time but
03:55 - over here I can just Place both
03:56 - characters exctly what I want I can
03:58 - embody one I can do my attack then I can
04:01 - jump into the other one do the defender
04:02 - animation and Y there it is a perfect
04:04 - attacker Defender animation directly
04:06 - inside of my un game and again it only
04:08 - took me a few minutes to record this
04:10 - completely custom animation one really
04:11 - awesome really cool thing is actually
04:13 - scale for example here I have a scene
04:15 - with an adult and a child if I embody
04:17 - the adult so here is the view everything
04:20 - looks pretty normal now if I go out and
04:22 - I embody the child and yep look at that
04:24 - now I can see everything exactly as the
04:26 - child's eye see importantly no the scale
04:29 - of everything it's all scaled correctly
04:30 - based on the size of the character that
04:32 - I'm embodying I think this is actually
04:33 - really awesome this is a really cool
04:35 - feature it really takes the character
04:37 - size into account when doing anything to
04:38 - see all kinds of perspective that way
04:40 - makes it really perfect to record an
04:41 - animation on a small child or a huge or
04:44 - creature as an actor you don't have to
04:46 - pretend that you're looking at a
04:47 - different place than what you're looking
04:48 - at as you embody the character the
04:50 - entire world gets scaled up or down
04:52 - depending on the size of your character
04:53 - they actually initially started building
04:55 - this tool for making virtual production
04:57 - for kid shows so this also perfect for
04:59 - just making simple cut scenes or short
05:01 - films you can select the scene
05:03 - background then place your characters
05:05 - place your lights and all your cameras
05:06 - and as always remember how you can do
05:08 - all this either completely Solo or
05:09 - together with multiple people online at
05:11 - the same time so for example you can
05:13 - have multiple actors embody each
05:15 - character also by the way you can also
05:17 - enable the headset microphone in order
05:18 - to automatically add lip syncing as the
05:20 - character stalk so you set up the actors
05:22 - and have someone set up the light so
05:24 - really position them set up the color
05:25 - temperature and so on then you can have
05:27 - someone control the camera either a
05:29 - fixed camera from a fixed Viewpoint and
05:31 - control the field of view and all those
05:32 - settings or it can also have a realtime
05:35 - camera you can embody a invisible
05:36 - character inside of VR then hold the
05:38 - camera and literally move it around or
05:40 - alternatively just have a director to
05:42 - manage all of it which by the way those
05:43 - don't need to be in VR you can have some
05:46 - users in VR and some users on a normal
05:48 - desktop another quick mention is how you
05:50 - can also enable physics on the object
05:51 - which can make your scenes feel quite a
05:53 - bit more natural and also a bit strange
05:54 - when seeing for example the fingers over
05:56 - here on this character the way the
05:57 - fingers move around with physics
05:59 - actually quite interesting so anyways
06:01 - you can set up the scene you can start
06:02 - recording and get a ton of takes done
06:04 - super quickly put it all together and
06:06 - you can really record an entire ciz
06:07 - sequence cut scene and do all that at
06:09 - lightning fast speed another cool use
06:11 - case is for making game trailers you can
06:14 - load your own custom assets to use when
06:15 - recording you're not limited to just the
06:17 - built-in assets you can load
06:19 - environments characters props or really
06:21 - anything so for example here is a custom
06:24 - environment with some characters and
06:25 - props that I grab from an asset pack
06:26 - that I own let's say for example these
06:28 - were the exact same assets that I was
06:29 - using to build my game now over here I
06:31 - can just act out some scenario for the
06:33 - game trailer this can be really awesome
06:35 - for making your trailers quite a bit
06:36 - more interesting by having something
06:38 - other than just gameplay footage and
06:40 - again with an motive you can record this
06:42 - footage and iterate upon it super
06:43 - quickly now here's a super quick getting
06:45 - start guy you just download and install
06:47 - and motive then create a brand new
06:50 - project you create a new scene and open
06:52 - it then put on your headset just make
06:54 - sure it's connected to your computer
06:56 - wait for others to join if you want
06:57 - multiplayer otherwise just start in
06:59 - single player so here I am inside the
07:01 - scene now I can just select the
07:03 - character and place it in the world I
07:04 - can point at the character and embody it
07:06 - there's the mirror image showing exactly
07:08 - what I look like now I can do whatever
07:10 - animation I want like for example just a
07:12 - simple wave also by the way you can
07:13 - modify the hand shape to a bunch of
07:15 - different ones or you can customize all
07:17 - these hand shapes then if you want to
07:18 - make a cut scene you can continue adding
07:20 - some cameras and lights but in this case
07:22 - let's say all we want is just a simple
07:24 - animation so I hold the Y button for a
07:26 - while in order to start recording now
07:28 - record my animation and press the button
07:30 - again to stop and now I can go into
07:32 - export and let's export as an fbx and
07:35 - yep here we have the fun fbx is a pre-
07:37 - universal format we can open this in
07:39 - blender to do whatever we want or just
07:41 - straight into unity and yep here it is
07:43 - in unity just loads as a normal humanoid
07:45 - animation so here is a standard
07:47 - character and if I the animation yep
07:49 - there it is everything works so I really
07:51 - just made a custom animation in a few
07:52 - seconds this is really awesome now in
07:54 - terms of requirements all you need is
07:56 - just a Windows 10 PC and a VR headset
07:58 - with a Link cable or wireless link in my
08:00 - case I've been using it with the Quest 2
08:02 - and I have the Oculus Link cable if you
08:05 - have a quest Pro you can also do some
08:06 - full face capture and for really
08:08 - high-end use cases this also works with
08:10 - the xense performance capture suit this
08:12 - is a pre- serious very expensive suit if
08:14 - you need absolutely perfect motion
08:16 - capture then sure go ahead and use it
08:18 - but chances are you don't need it using
08:19 - a Quest SE like I've been doing Works
08:21 - actually surprisingly great the only
08:22 - obvious limitation is of course you can
08:24 - only control the upper body so you can't
08:26 - really do animations for like doing back
08:28 - flips or kicks although the legs and the
08:30 - elbow ik is actually still very good in
08:32 - all my testing I never really got the
08:34 - characters into strange positions and in
08:36 - terms of pricing you can try it out for
08:38 - free which I think is really awesome if
08:39 - you already have a headset then it's
08:41 - literally free so definitely go ahead
08:42 - and try it out with the link in the
08:43 - description the free tier has the exact
08:45 - same features as all the other tiers the
08:47 - limitation is non-commercial use which
08:49 - really means that you can use this in
08:51 - all the game jams you want and then if
08:53 - you do find it extremely useful and you
08:54 - want to use it in a commercial project
08:56 - you can pick up the Indian license which
08:58 - is actually quite affordable so so this
08:59 - is a really awesome tool I definitely
09:01 - enjoyed my time playing with it the main
09:03 - thing that impressed me is really the
09:04 - ease of use and the iteration speed when
09:06 - making your own games if you need some
09:07 - kind of custom animation instead of
09:09 - spending hours cycling through tons of
09:11 - Animation packs to find the one
09:12 - animation you need instead you just put
09:14 - on the headset and in 60 seconds you
09:16 - have a really awesome complete custom
09:17 - animation so definitely go ahead and try
09:19 - it out check the link in the description
09:20 - and I really do hope that this tool
09:22 - helps you bring your Game Dev dreams to
09:24 - life thanks to Animoto for sponsoring
09:25 - this video thank you for watching and
09:27 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey normally doing moap animation is something that requires lots of money and tons of equipment however here let's see a tool called anim motive that lets you record map animations of very high quality although this is also so much more than just a map animation tool you can create fullon Cuts scenes or short films basically you can set up a world then you can play some lights play some cameras and position them exactly where you want them just like you would in a normal film set then you can use some props you can write the script and just act the way you act is you literally embody the characters that you place on the scene and then move and talk and do whatever you want you can have a director control the camera movement or swap between cameras you can also control an invisible character and do some really cool handheld camera movement you can make animations with multiple characters like two people talking to each other or an attacker and Defender animations so for example you record one character then cut move to the other character and record some more this makes the final animation be perfectly sync or you can do all this in collaboration with other people in real time either in a shared VR space where everyone is in VR or just some people in VR like just the actors and have the others on a regular desktop like director then you can either render video from what all the camera see or export this animation onto an fpx file which you can then load inside blender or unity and use in any way you want this is a really awesome tool I definitely enjoyed my time playing with it this video is sponsored by anim motive but I wouldn't do a sponsored video if I didn't think this human was generally awesome so I do think this is great and extremely useful especially for Indie devs while also being being completely free to try out so after watching this video definitely go ahead check the link in the description to go try it out like I said this has a ton of use cases I'll go through a bunch of them in the ways that I think can help you make your own games and then I'll also do a quick getting started tutorial it's actually surprisingly easy to get started now as an in developer the main use case that I thought of right away was just quickly making some very custom animations nowadays the accur is really awesome you can very quickly very easily find tons of animations however they usually come in some really huge pack and not as individual animations so if you need just one very specific thing like just a simple hand wve picking up a giant pack with 100 animation just to get the one you want and hope that it's exactly as you want that can be quite annoying quite timec consuming so instead in just 60 seconds you can pick up your headset and easily record the exact animation you want so this tool is really excellent for helping you speed up iteration time which as a need Dev is definitely one of the most valuable things you have or another use case is for making some super custom animations like for example if you have a character sitting at a desk working on a computer most animation packs are really for things like attacks and movement animations so finding an animation for something very specific like just working on a computer that is actually quite tricky again you can very quickly just put on a headset and record the exact animation you want it can be working on a computer it can be eating a burger doing some fancy ninja moves maybe some bicep curls shooting a spider web from the wrist pulling a simple lever hammering a nail and so on finding animation packs for such unique animations is actually really hard but in 60 seconds you can really just put on the headset and create the exact animation you want very easily then of course you can just export and import it into Unity or blender if you want to tweak something another excellent use case for recording multiple character animations now this one is really especially cool for me I'm a Sol developer I work just by myself so the ability to do Moab to create animations that involve multiple characters and do that just by myself is really awesome for example something super simple just making two characters talk to one another I can just Place both characters in the scene then I can body the first character and record the animation then stop recording embody the second character record again and yep now this records both animations at the exact same time I'm really amazed at how well this workflow works even when it's just a single developer jumping back and forth another example something that is usually pretty tricky is doing attacker and Defender animations basically attacks that involve two characters usually that's really tricky to sync in order to make sure that the attack and Defender act at the exact same time but over here I can just Place both characters exctly what I want I can embody one I can do my attack then I can jump into the other one do the defender animation and Y there it is a perfect attacker Defender animation directly inside of my un game and again it only took me a few

make your scenes feel quite a bit more natural and also a bit strange when seeing for example the fingers over here on this character the way the fingers move around with physics actually quite interesting so anyways you can set up the scene you can start recording and get a ton of takes done super quickly put it all together and you can really record an entire ciz sequence cut scene and do all that at lightning fast speed another cool use case is for making game trailers you can load your own custom assets to use when recording you're not limited to just the builtin assets you can load environments characters props or really anything so for example here is a custom environment with some characters and props that I grab from an asset pack that I own let's say for example these were the exact same assets that I was using to build my game now over here I can just act out some scenario for the game trailer this can be really awesome for making your trailers quite a bit more interesting by having something other than just gameplay footage and again with an motive you can record this footage and iterate upon it super quickly now here's a super quick getting start guy you just download and install and motive then create a brand new project you create a new scene and open it then put on your headset just make sure it's connected to your computer wait for others to join if you want multiplayer otherwise just start in single player so here I am inside the scene now I can just select the character and place it in the world I can point at the character and embody it there's the mirror image showing exactly what I look like now I can do whatever animation I want like for example just a simple wave also by the way you can modify the hand shape to a bunch of
