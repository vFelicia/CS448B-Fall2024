00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI the
00:02 - asseta is full of awesome tools and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - April 24 in this first video I'll be
00:11 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:12 - ones I'll be covering paid ass and tools
00:14 - let me know in the comments if you pick
00:15 - up any of these and what you intend to
00:16 - do with them also quick update on my C
00:18 - course I'm currently editing the first
00:20 - few lectures for the advance section
00:22 - which will be out soon and the free
00:23 - YouTube video with the intermediate
00:25 - section that one w't be out on next
00:26 - Monday also course students and channel
00:28 - members get access to the private
00:29 - community Discord as well as the QA and
00:31 - live streams that happen every Saturday
00:33 - so if you have any questions join the
00:34 - live stream and ask and I'll do my best
00:35 - to help all right so on to the top 10
00:37 - list starting off with a fun one all
00:39 - about generating gears you can Define
00:41 - how many gears you want then how many
00:43 - teeth per Gear and where exactly does
00:45 - the chain connect it's all precedently
00:47 - generated so it looks really great you
00:49 - can apply and move all kinds of Gears
00:51 - with all kinds of teeth and it all makes
00:52 - sense honestly this looks quite complex
00:54 - for a free asset I just recently got
00:56 - into cycling and whenever I get into
00:58 - something I go on YouTube and watch tons
01:00 - of videos on that topic and in this case
01:02 - I just watched some videos on how
01:03 - bicycle gears work now as fascinating So
01:06 - based on that if you'd like to make some
01:07 - kind of Simulator game involving gears
01:09 - and this asset is perfect next if you
01:11 - need a low poly character check out this
01:13 - one it's a pretty nice original design
01:15 - so if you're tired of the standard low
01:17 - poly sort of cinti style if so then this
01:19 - looks like a great alternative it is low
01:22 - poly but clearly a different style this
01:23 - one kind of reminds me of the game
01:25 - absolver it's a humanoid character so
01:27 - you can combine it with any animations
01:29 - then then here's a bit of a strange one
01:31 - it's a warehouse this is an asset
01:33 - officially made by unity apparently it's
01:36 - what they use for their digital twin
01:37 - tools it's a complete Warehouse so you
01:40 - have all kinds of shelves cargo
01:42 - equipment and a bunch of workers this is
01:44 - technically meant for making a virtual
01:45 - Warehouse just like you would have in
01:47 - real life and then you can do something
01:49 - like train an AI robot to learn how to
01:51 - walk around this warehouse and do all
01:52 - kinds of tasks and after training it you
01:54 - can then place that robot in Real Life
01:56 - and it will know how to navigate that
01:58 - real world environment I'm a say the
02:00 - concept of digital twins is something
02:02 - that does fascinate me in an alternate
02:04 - universe where I hadn't gotten into game
02:05 - development if so I think I would have
02:07 - gotten into robotics working on these
02:09 - kinds of systems then for a nice tool
02:11 - here is hierarchy designer the default
02:13 - Unity hierarchy is super basic there's
02:15 - really no way to organize things which
02:17 - can make it quite tricky when you have a
02:19 - complex scene setup whereas with a tool
02:21 - like this you can make it much more
02:22 - organized by applying a bunch of folders
02:24 - or you can make some things much more
02:26 - visible with some icons or some colors
02:28 - this one looks quite impressive
02:29 - impressive really capable and all in all
02:32 - it's a free tool next for some fun
02:34 - visuals here are some loading screen VFX
02:36 - this is the kind of thing you can see
02:38 - during various cutcenes in a Sci-Fi game
02:40 - where the character is interacting with
02:41 - some screen or maybe for example instead
02:43 - of a cut scene you could use this just
02:45 - in regular gameplay so in some game kind
02:47 - of like that space where you control a
02:49 - character whenever the player interacts
02:50 - with some computer you could show this
02:52 - kind of loading screen it looks very
02:53 - good very satified perfectly matches
02:55 - that aspect you've got several colors to
02:57 - choose which one you prefer or maybe
02:59 - inste you need a tool to highlight some
03:01 - object or character if so check out this
03:03 - one it's a post procing effect to
03:05 - highlight characters or some object on
03:07 - screen this is really excellent for
03:08 - doing things like tutorials where you
03:10 - really want to guide the players to look
03:12 - at one very specific spot this one
03:14 - includes lots of effects for different
03:16 - ways you can highlight objects some are
03:18 - pixelated some are just a round circle
03:20 - so you can apply this in various ways
03:22 - this is a very useful tool for all kinds
03:24 - of scenarios or if you want you can just
03:26 - download and inspect it to learn how to
03:28 - make some custom post Crossing effects
03:30 - and then here's a fun pack with a bunch
03:32 - of ships and planes every time I see a
03:34 - pack like this with a bunch of vehicles
03:36 - I always say the same thing I really
03:38 - wish I had the time to build a complete
03:39 - RTS game as a kid I spent a lot of time
03:42 - playing Age of Empires and Command and
03:43 - Conquer for making those kinds of games
03:45 - all you really need is just a pack like
03:47 - this one just a bunch of things with
03:48 - some Vehicles some planes boats cars and
03:51 - so on you just need those and just make
03:53 - different colors and suddenly you have
03:54 - multiple factions you can control or
03:56 - maybe with the same pack you could make
03:58 - one of those arcade helicopter Gam just
04:00 - fly a helicopter around some kind of
04:01 - base and shoot down cars and vehicles
04:04 - then for another nice visual tool here
04:05 - is mini Shadow this one lets you cast a
04:08 - shadow on an imaginary plane meaning
04:10 - it's not an actual Shadow it's not
04:12 - controlled by any lights it's not based
04:14 - on having a lit material or anything
04:15 - like that it's really a fake Shadow and
04:18 - you can cast Shadows from either 2D or
04:20 - 3D objects then you can play around with
04:22 - various settings modify the intensity or
04:24 - the attenuation of the mask and then if
04:25 - you need to upgrade your game's visuals
04:27 - one of the best ways to do that is with
04:29 - a Sky Box like this one this one is a
04:31 - pack with 15 super high resolution Sky
04:34 - boxes they all look really nice and
04:35 - stylized you've got lots of variation
04:37 - between some blue clear skies or some
04:39 - gorgeous sunsets or if instead you need
04:41 - some kind of weird monster creature
04:43 - check out this one it's really weird a
04:45 - very unique design very flash-like it's
04:47 - got all kinds of weird appendages and
04:49 - also includes some strange animations
04:51 - like swimming and punching while
04:53 - submersed I guess it makes sense for
04:54 - some kind of water creature and it also
04:56 - comes with some really cool strange bone
04:58 - axe weapon so if you wanted you could
05:00 - just take this weapon and use that with
05:02 - some kind of human character all right
05:03 - so those are my top 10 free new assets
05:05 - on the UR for April 24 there's links
05:08 - well in the description and also check
05:09 - out my own fre Pedas on store all right
05:11 - hope that's useful check out these
05:13 - videos to learn some more thanks to
05:15 - these awesome patreon supporters for
05:16 - making these videos possible thank you
05:18 - for watching and I'll see you next
05:24 - [Music]
05:27 - time
