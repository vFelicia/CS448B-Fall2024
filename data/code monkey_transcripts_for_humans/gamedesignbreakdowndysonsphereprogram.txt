00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and this is my game dev review of dyson
00:04 - sphere program a game made with unity
00:06 - it's developed by youth cat studio which
00:08 - is a small five person studio so it's
00:10 - very impressive when you see the scale
00:11 - of the game
00:12 - here i will do a brief review of the
00:14 - game and then give you my thoughts from
00:15 - my point of view as a game developer
00:17 - as well as give you some tips for how
00:19 - you can improve your own games
00:20 - by the way this is my second game dev
00:22 - review and i've made a playlist and a
00:24 - steam curator page to group them all
00:26 - my goal is to continue making these to
00:28 - give you some great game design tips
00:30 - using these games as an example check
00:32 - out all the reviews in the steam curator
00:34 - page or on the playlist
00:35 - so dyson sphere program is a sci-fi
00:37 - factory automation game
00:39 - you control your mecha and start off
00:40 - manually mining basic resources
00:43 - then you do some research and start
00:44 - building some machines to do the mining
00:46 - for you
00:47 - you take those base materials and turn
00:48 - them into more and more complex items
00:51 - then eventually when you start needing
00:53 - some more space to build or some more
00:54 - exotic resources you will leave your
00:56 - home and begin colonizing other
00:58 - planets and just like the name of the
01:00 - game implies eventually you start
01:01 - needing more and more energy so you
01:03 - build a dyson sphere to harvest
01:05 - energy directly from the sun the game
01:07 - has an excellent sense of progression
01:09 - you're never stopped there's always
01:10 - something to do some new research to
01:12 - unlock
01:13 - a new item to craft or some optimization
01:15 - to be done visually the game looks great
01:17 - it's got this nice cartooning look with
01:19 - high saturation
01:20 - all the planets are nicely round with
01:22 - some great terrain and some great
01:23 - atmospheric effects
01:25 - the stars also look visually very
01:26 - impressive everything from neutron stars
01:29 - to red dwarfs to black holes they all
01:31 - look great
01:31 - the look of the game is really very
01:33 - inviting and relaxing which works well
01:35 - with all the automation happening in the
01:37 - background
01:38 - it is a complex game but also a somewhat
01:40 - relaxing game because there's no combat
01:42 - so there's really not many penalties to
01:44 - not making things 100 efficient
01:46 - and on the other hand it's really
01:48 - satisfying to build the perfect
01:49 - production line and just watch all of
01:51 - the machines working perfectly
01:53 - and the scale of the game is obviously
01:55 - massive the game is randomly generated
01:57 - so the first thing you do
01:58 - is generate a random universe you can
02:00 - make it really massive or
02:02 - relatively small each of these stars has
02:04 - multiple planets orbiting around them
02:06 - so even the smallest universe is already
02:08 - pretty massive as i said there's all
02:10 - kinds of stars from neutron stars to
02:12 - white dwarfs to black holes
02:13 - so if you're into astronomy then the
02:15 - game is just fun to be around in
02:17 - everything is accurately simulated all
02:19 - the planets have their orbits along with
02:20 - their moons
02:21 - visually these stars and black holes
02:23 - look great some planets are tidally
02:24 - locked and so on
02:26 - then on this story the game actually has
02:28 - a bit of story at least relative to a
02:29 - simulation management game
02:31 - i mean you don't see much of it but the
02:33 - core concept behind it is actually quite
02:35 - interesting the idea is that humanity
02:37 - now spends more time in virtual reality
02:39 - as opposed to the real world but with
02:41 - more and more people naturally they need
02:43 - more and more energy to run that virtual
02:45 - reality
02:45 - so it's a simple concept but works great
02:47 - for giving the game a reason to explore
02:49 - the cosmos and gather more and more
02:51 - energy and resources
02:52 - if you enjoy factory automation games
02:54 - like factorio
02:55 - production line or satisfactory then
02:57 - you'll certainly enjoy this one
02:59 - they had a successful kickstarter last
03:01 - year where they raised fifteen thousand
03:03 - dollars
03:04 - and now in just the first week they
03:05 - already sold over three hundred and
03:07 - fifty thousand copies
03:09 - this is a very inspiring story of a
03:10 - small studio finding massive monumental
03:12 - success with an excellent game
03:14 - so if you're a fan of this type of game
03:16 - then this is an absolute must play
03:18 - now here's my thoughts from my point of
03:20 - view as a game developer as well as some
03:22 - takeaways for you to improve your own
03:24 - games
03:25 - i will go through each point
03:26 - highlighting what i think the game does
03:27 - well and what lessons you can learn from
03:29 - it
03:30 - the game is out in early access but it's
03:32 - already extremely stable and
03:34 - feature rich i've played it for over 30
03:36 - hours and i haven't encountered any bugs
03:39 - this is definitely one of those games
03:40 - where you can easily get a ton of
03:42 - enjoyment
03:42 - right now and then play it again in a
03:44 - few years after the phone release
03:46 - even performance has not been an issue
03:48 - in late game with tons and tons of
03:49 - machines and thousands of items moving
03:51 - around the game still runs extremely
03:53 - smooth
03:54 - so as a developer if you decide to go
03:56 - with early access
03:57 - then this is something that you need to
03:58 - be careful with gone are the days
04:00 - of players looking at early access games
04:03 - and accepting tons of bugs or no content
04:05 - if you launch into our only access then
04:07 - this is your competition an extremely
04:08 - well made game with already tons and
04:10 - tons of content
04:12 - now the good news is that if you do do
04:14 - it right then you won't be massively
04:16 - rewarded just like this game
04:17 - thanks to the success of this very first
04:19 - week these developers already have more
04:21 - than enough funds to fully build their
04:23 - complete vision over the next few years
04:25 - also i'm quite impressed with how the
04:27 - game is built with unity
04:28 - i remember a long time ago when i first
04:31 - played factorio
04:32 - i remember researching and coming to the
04:34 - conclusion that in order to support such
04:35 - a huge amount of objects it really
04:37 - needed a custom engine
04:39 - but fast forward to now a few years
04:41 - later and this is possible
04:42 - as you might know unity has been pushing
04:44 - hard for performance these past few
04:46 - years
04:46 - the dot stack has the potential for
04:48 - extreme performance and i wonder if this
04:50 - game is using any part of it or maybe
04:52 - some custom ecs solution
04:54 - either way the massive scale combined
04:56 - with excellent performance is a very
04:57 - inspiring feat of engineering
04:59 - i want to get back into that soon and
05:01 - when i do i will definitely be
05:02 - experimenting with making a mini game on
05:04 - this scale
05:05 - just to be able to see how far we can
05:06 - push it one tiny excellent thing about
05:09 - the game is how the inventory splitting
05:10 - works
05:11 - you right click and then move the mouse
05:13 - left or right to select what amount you
05:15 - want to split
05:16 - it is a much better and much more
05:17 - intuitive system than what games usually
05:19 - do
05:20 - which is pop up a window where then you
05:22 - input an amount or spam the increase or
05:24 - decrease buttons
05:25 - that's an example of a tiny tiny thing
05:27 - that greatly improves the feel of the
05:28 - game
05:29 - i just wish this same system was also
05:31 - added to the replicator
05:32 - using a slider would be much better than
05:34 - spamming the plus or minus buttons
05:36 - or at least had the ability to hold down
05:37 - the button and by the way if you find
05:39 - the video helpful consider subscribing
05:41 - and hitting the like button
05:42 - it really helps out the channel another
05:44 - thing that the game does great is like i
05:46 - said the entire star system is simulated
05:49 - as you're playing
05:50 - so right in the beginning when you're in
05:51 - the very first planet you actually see
05:53 - the star making daytime and nighttime
05:55 - depending on its position on the sky
05:57 - adding a day night cycle is usually
05:59 - relatively easy doesn't have to be 100
06:01 - accurate like this game
06:02 - and by adding it you will make your game
06:04 - feel a lot more believable
06:06 - you can queue up actions and one very
06:08 - good decision about it is how it
06:09 - locks the camera as you hold down shift
06:12 - if the camera did keep following the
06:13 - player then it would be very tricky to
06:15 - click
06:15 - exactly where you want it so when you
06:17 - add actions and abilities to your games
06:19 - make sure the player can use them
06:20 - without
06:21 - unnecessary frustration another tiny but
06:24 - very useful thing is what you can see on
06:25 - the upper right corner
06:27 - you see the version as well as the theme
06:29 - name of the account playing
06:30 - this can be very useful especially for
06:32 - early access games if you see a video on
06:34 - youtube showcasing some sort of bug
06:37 - you can verify the version and then know
06:39 - if you've already fixed that bug or not
06:41 - like i said this is very useful
06:42 - especially for early access games or
06:44 - games that are in constant development
06:46 - feel free to put any debug data in the
06:48 - corner so you can essentially get bug
06:49 - reports just by watching people play
06:51 - your game on youtube
06:52 - when you open the inventory you see the
06:54 - commands for how to interact with it
06:56 - it's always helpful to give the player a
06:57 - reminder of all the mechanics you have
06:59 - in your game rather than just showing
07:01 - them once in the tutorial and never
07:02 - mentioning it again
07:04 - for example i know that i forgot the
07:05 - commands instantly and looked at the
07:07 - tutorial many many times over my
07:09 - playthrough
07:09 - this is also visible when you're doing
07:11 - other actions like for example placing
07:13 - down conveyor belts
07:14 - so if possible give the player reminders
07:16 - of all the actions they can take
07:18 - just make sure you don't do it in an
07:20 - annoying way after the first time just
07:22 - show them at the corner of the screen
07:24 - and not always as some flashy thing on
07:26 - top
07:26 - one of the things i do wish the game had
07:28 - was a smaller view of the replicator
07:31 - in the beginning of the game you will be
07:33 - doing a lot of the crafting manually
07:35 - and in order to see the progress you can
07:36 - only see it with the replicator window
07:38 - open
07:39 - this window is pretty big so it's quite
07:40 - annoying to keep it open at all times
07:42 - it would be great if it just had a small
07:45 - widget showcasing the replicator queue
07:46 - so you could easily see it at a glance
07:48 - or maybe the developers made that an
07:51 - intentional choice to discourage manual
07:52 - crafting
07:53 - if so then personally i don't think this
07:55 - decision achieves the desired effect
07:57 - other than annoying the player in the
07:59 - very beginning of the game
08:00 - remember that most players don't play
08:02 - games to completion in fact very few
08:04 - actually complete games so make sure the
08:06 - start of your game is the best it can be
08:08 - otherwise people will never see all the
08:10 - cool stuff that you place at the end
08:12 - always keep in mind what the player will
08:14 - spend most of their time doing
08:15 - if the player is spending most of the
08:17 - time looking at an annoying window then
08:18 - that's a problem
08:20 - the simple solution here is a smaller
08:21 - window just showing the current progress
08:23 - without occupying tons of space
08:25 - that wouldn't let the player quickly see
08:27 - it at a glance without also removing the
08:29 - option for the phone window
08:31 - another thing that i wish the game had
08:32 - was some sort of indication as to
08:34 - whether or not the player is in range
08:36 - this is not a god game you are indeed
08:38 - moving a
08:39 - individual character and if you are too
08:42 - far then you cannot inspect a building
08:44 - you have to move closer to see
08:45 - it but there is no indication to the
08:47 - player if the distance is enough
08:48 - so either it works or doesn't whenever
08:51 - possible you should always make sure
08:52 - that the player actions have some sort
08:54 - of feedback or some sort of response
08:56 - the player should always be aware of the
08:58 - fact that the game received or did not
09:00 - receive a certain input
09:02 - in this case adding a warning every time
09:04 - it failed would be
09:05 - way too annoying but adding a slight
09:07 - visual indicator like for example
09:09 - just changing the visual bounding box
09:11 - from white to green
09:12 - that would go a long way to making the
09:13 - game feel just a tiny bit more
09:15 - responsive
09:16 - another great design decision is how
09:18 - dismantling objects is free
09:20 - usually you actually want your demolish
09:22 - to have a certain cost
09:23 - in order to encourage the player to
09:24 - think carefully the first time they
09:26 - build something
09:27 - but in games like this one where the
09:29 - primary focus is on
09:30 - optimizing your supply routes and
09:32 - increasing efficiency in this case
09:34 - you really want the player to not be
09:35 - punished for reworking and rebuilding
09:37 - how their production lines work
09:39 - so if you want to encourage careful
09:41 - thinking make demolish have a cost
09:42 - on the other hand if you want to
09:44 - encourage experimentation make demolish
09:46 - be free
09:47 - however there is one somewhat negative
09:49 - thing when you're dismantling objects
09:51 - there's no confirmation whatsoever if
09:53 - you click it gets dismantled
09:55 - if it is a building with items inside
09:57 - you get the items placed in your
09:58 - inventory
09:59 - but if you have no space then they are
10:01 - simply lost forever
10:02 - another thing that compounds this issue
10:04 - is that when you enter the build mode it
10:06 - does a slight zoom out which contributes
10:08 - to clicking on the wrong thing
10:10 - i mentioned previously how the camera
10:11 - stops moving when you queue up actions
10:13 - which lets you click where you want
10:15 - and here we see the problem with not
10:16 - doing that it greatly increases the
10:18 - chances of a misclick
10:19 - on the one hand i get why there's no
10:21 - confirmation you want dismantling to be
10:23 - as seamless as possible
10:25 - but on the other hand accidentally
10:26 - removing a building is always annoying
10:28 - and losing items is always terrible
10:30 - my solution here would be to remove the
10:32 - automatic zoom out when
10:34 - entering build mode in order to prevent
10:35 - misclicks and to add a tiny confirmation
10:38 - box
10:38 - on top of the mouse position if the
10:40 - number of items was large or complex
10:43 - that way you could easily remove
10:44 - conveyor belts without issues
10:46 - but removing a building with expensive
10:48 - items inside would require confirmation
10:50 - whenever you have actions that can lead
10:52 - to somewhat serious permanent
10:53 - consequences
10:54 - like for example losing a bunch of items
10:56 - you should always ask the player for
10:58 - confirmation
10:59 - another excellent tiny thing when you're
11:01 - playing the correct way to rotate the
11:03 - camera is by holding down the middle
11:04 - mouse button
11:06 - however you might forget that and
11:08 - actually try rotating by holding the
11:09 - right mouse button
11:11 - if you do this then the game notices
11:12 - that and if you try doing it for a few
11:14 - seconds it shows a pop-up telling you
11:16 - the correct way to rotate the camera
11:18 - this is an excellent way to teach the
11:20 - player if while doing your own play
11:22 - testing you find that your testers
11:24 - intuitively do an action different than
11:26 - the intended you can either
11:28 - change the action or do this and listen
11:30 - to the incorrect action to make a pop-up
11:32 - to remind the player of the correct
11:33 - action
11:34 - right now the game doesn't feature any
11:36 - combat but they're planning to add it in
11:38 - a future update
11:39 - i've played the game for over 30 hours
11:41 - and i didn't feel the lack of combat at
11:42 - all
11:43 - there's more than enough to do with
11:45 - building a huge factory and setting up
11:46 - all the supply chains on the whole
11:48 - universe
11:49 - so that brings a very important game
11:51 - design question when making your own
11:53 - games you have to remember that more
11:55 - mechanics and features
11:56 - is not necessarily better sometimes
11:58 - adding more mechanics really just
12:00 - downloads your design and makes the game
12:01 - worse
12:02 - in this example right now the game is
12:04 - excellent
12:05 - if you add a subpar combat system on top
12:07 - then that won't possibly take the player
12:09 - away from the good part of building the
12:11 - factories
12:11 - and make the game actually worse but of
12:13 - course it is also impossible that they
12:15 - implement it in such a way that
12:16 - complements the building and doesn't
12:18 - distract from it
12:19 - so the lesson to you is more mechanics
12:21 - aren't necessarily better
12:22 - and if you do add some new feature make
12:24 - sure it actually improves the game
12:26 - as usual prototyping is always your
12:28 - friend so i look forward to playing this
12:30 - game again in the full release to see
12:32 - how they ended up implementing combat
12:34 - alright so those are my thoughts on
12:35 - dyson sphere program a game made with
12:37 - yinty
12:38 - i definitely love playing this one it's
12:40 - really my kind of game
12:41 - if you're a fan of factory automation
12:43 - management games then this is a must
12:44 - play
12:45 - as a unity developer it is excellent to
12:47 - have this game as an example for the
12:49 - kind of scale that is possible to
12:50 - achieve with the engine
12:52 - by the way this is my second game dev
12:53 - review and i've made a playlist and a
12:55 - steam creator page to group them all
12:57 - my goal is to continue making these to
12:59 - give you some great game design tips
13:00 - using these games as
13:01 - examples check out all of the reviews in
13:04 - the steam curator page or on the
13:05 - playlist
13:07 - if you enjoyed the video and found my
13:08 - thoughts on game design helpful consider
13:10 - liking and subscribing
13:11 - this video is made possible thanks to

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this is my game dev review of dyson sphere program a game made with unity it's developed by youth cat studio which is a small five person studio so it's very impressive when you see the scale of the game here i will do a brief review of the game and then give you my thoughts from my point of view as a game developer as well as give you some tips for how you can improve your own games by the way this is my second game dev review and i've made a playlist and a steam curator page to group them all my goal is to continue making these to give you some great game design tips using these games as an example check out all the reviews in the steam curator page or on the playlist so dyson sphere program is a scifi factory automation game you control your mecha and start off manually mining basic resources then you do some research and start building some machines to do the mining for you you take those base materials and turn them into more and more complex items then eventually when you start needing some more space to build or some more exotic resources you will leave your home and begin colonizing other planets and just like the name of the game implies eventually you start needing more and more energy so you build a dyson sphere to harvest energy directly from the sun the game has an excellent sense of progression you're never stopped there's always something to do some new research to unlock a new item to craft or some optimization to be done visually the game looks great it's got this nice cartooning look with high saturation all the planets are nicely round with some great terrain and some great atmospheric effects the stars also look visually very impressive everything from neutron stars to red dwarfs to black holes they all look great the look of the game is really very inviting and relaxing which works well with all the automation happening in the background it is a complex game but also a somewhat relaxing game because there's no combat so there's really not many penalties to not making things 100 efficient and on the other hand it's really satisfying to build the perfect production line and just watch all of the machines working perfectly and the scale of the game is obviously massive the game is randomly generated so the first thing you do is generate a random universe you can make it really massive or relatively small each of these stars has multiple planets orbiting around them so even the smallest universe is already pretty massive as i said there's all kinds of stars from neutron stars to white dwarfs to black holes so if you're into astronomy then the game is just fun to be around in everything is accurately simulated all the planets have their orbits along with their moons visually these stars and black holes look great some planets are tidally locked and so on then on this story the game actually has a bit of story at least relative to a simulation management game i mean you don't see much of it but the core concept behind it is actually quite interesting the idea is that humanity now spends more time in virtual reality as opposed to the real world but with more and more people naturally they need more and more energy to run that virtual reality so it's a simple concept but works great for giving the game a reason to explore the cosmos and gather more and more energy and resources if you enjoy factory automation games like factorio production line or satisfactory then you'll certainly enjoy this one they had a successful kickstarter last year where they raised fifteen thousand dollars and now in just the first week they already sold over three hundred and fifty thousand copies this is a very inspiring story of a small studio finding massive monumental success with an excellent game so if you're a fan of this type of game then this is an absolute must play now here's my thoughts from my point of view as a game developer as well as some takeaways for you to improve your own games i will go through each point highlighting what i think the game does well and what lessons you can learn from it the game is out in early access but it's already extremely stable and feature rich i've played it for over 30 hours and i haven't encountered any bugs this is definitely one of those games where you can easily get a ton of enjoyment right now and then play it again in a few years after the phone release even performance has not been an issue in late game with tons and tons of machines and thousands of items moving around the game still runs extremely smooth so as a developer if you decide to go with early access then this is something that you need to be careful with gone are the days of players looking at early access games and accepting tons of bugs or no content if you launch into our only access then this is your competition an extremely well made game with already tons and tons of content now the good news is that if you do do it right then you won't be massively rewarded just like this game thanks to the success of this very first week these developers already have more than enough funds to fully build their complete vision over the next few years also i'm quite impressed with how the game is built with unity i remember a long time ago when i first played factorio i remember researching and coming to the conclusion that in order to support such a huge amount of objects it really needed a custom engine but fast forward to now a few years later and this is possible as you might know unity has been pushing hard for performance these past few years the dot stack has the potential for extreme performance and i wonder if this game is using any part of it or maybe some custom ecs solution either way the massive scale combined with excellent performance is a very inspiring feat of engineering i want to get back into that soon and when i do i will definitely be experimenting with making a mini game on this scale just to be able to see how far we can push it one tiny excellent thing about the game is how the inventory splitting works you right click and then move the mouse left or right to select what amount you want to split it is a much better and much more intuitive system than what games usually do which is pop up a window where then you input an amount or spam the increase or decrease buttons that's an example of a tiny tiny thing that greatly improves the feel of the game i just wish this same system was also added to the replicator using a slider would be much better than spamming the plus or minus buttons or at least had the ability to hold down the button and by the way if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and hitting the like button it really helps out the channel another thing that the game does great is like i said the entire star system is simulated as you're playing so right in the beginning when you're in the very first planet you actually see the star making daytime and nighttime depending on its position on the sky adding a day night cycle is usually relatively easy doesn't have to be 100 accurate like this game and by adding it you will make your game feel a lot more believable you can queue up actions and one very good decision about it is how it locks the camera as you hold down shift if the camera did keep following the player then it would be very tricky to click exactly where you want it so when you add actions and abilities to your games make sure the player can use them without unnecessary frustration another tiny but very useful thing is what you can see on the upper right corner you see the version as well as the theme name of the account playing this can be very useful especially for early access games if you see a video on youtube showcasing some sort of bug you can verify the version and then know if you've already fixed that bug or not like i said this is very useful especially for early access games or games that are in constant development feel free to put any debug data in the corner so you can essentially get bug reports just by watching people play your game on youtube when you open the inventory you see the commands for how to interact with it it's always helpful to give the player a reminder of all the mechanics you have in your game rather than just showing them once in the tutorial and never mentioning it again for example i know that i forgot the commands instantly and looked at the tutorial many many times over my playthrough this is also visible when you're doing other actions like for example placing down conveyor belts so if possible give the player reminders of all the actions they can take just make sure you don't do it in an annoying way after the first time just show them at the corner of the screen and not always as some flashy thing on top one of the things i do wish the game had was a smaller view of the replicator in the beginning of the game you will be doing a lot of the crafting manually and in order to see the progress you can only see it with the replicator window open this window is pretty big so it's quite annoying to keep it open at all times it would be great if it just had a small widget showcasing the replicator queue so you could easily see it at a glance or maybe the developers made that an intentional choice to discourage manual crafting if so then personally i don't think this decision achieves the desired effect other than annoying the player in the very beginning of the game remember that most players don't play games to completion in fact very few actually complete games so make sure the start of your game is the best it can be otherwise people will never see all the cool stuff that you place at the end always keep in mind what the player will spend most of their time doing if the player is spending most of the time looking at an annoying window then that's a problem the simple solution here is a smaller window just showing the current progress without occupying tons of space that wouldn't let the player quickly see it at a glance without also removing the option for the phone window another thing that i wish the game had was some sort of indication as to whether or not the player is in range this is not a god game you are indeed moving a individual character and if you are too far then you cannot inspect a building you have to move closer to see it but there is no indication to the player if the distance is enough so either it works or doesn't whenever possible you should always make sure that the player actions have some sort of feedback or some sort of response the player should always be aware of the fact that the game received or did not receive a certain input in this case adding a warning every time it failed would be way too annoying but adding a slight visual indicator like for example just changing the visual bounding box from white to green that would go a long way to making the game feel just a tiny bit more responsive another great design decision is how dismantling objects is free usually you actually want your demolish to have a certain cost in order to encourage the player to think carefully the first time they build something but in games like this one where the primary focus is on optimizing your supply routes and increasing efficiency in this case you really want the player to not be punished for reworking and rebuilding how their production lines work so if you want to encourage careful thinking make demolish have a cost on the other hand if you want to encourage experimentation make demolish be free however there is one somewhat negative thing when you're dismantling objects there's no confirmation whatsoever if you click it gets dismantled if it is a building with items inside you get the items placed in your inventory but if you have no space then they are simply lost forever another thing that compounds this issue is that when you enter the build mode it does a slight zoom out which contributes to clicking on the wrong thing i mentioned previously how the camera stops moving when you queue up actions which lets you click where you want and here we see the problem with not doing that it greatly increases the chances of a misclick on the one hand i get why there's no confirmation you want dismantling to be as seamless as possible but on the other hand accidentally removing a building is always annoying and losing items is always terrible my solution here would be to remove the automatic zoom out when entering build mode in order to prevent misclicks and to add a tiny confirmation box on top of the mouse position if the number of items was large or complex that way you could easily remove conveyor belts without issues but removing a building with expensive items inside would require confirmation whenever you have actions that can lead to somewhat serious permanent consequences like for example losing a bunch of items you should always ask the player for confirmation another excellent tiny thing when you're playing the correct way to rotate the camera is by holding down the middle mouse button however you might forget that and actually try rotating by holding the right mouse button if you do this then the game notices that and if you try doing it for a few seconds it shows a popup telling you the correct way to rotate the camera this is an excellent way to teach the player if while doing your own play testing you find that your testers intuitively do an action different than the intended you can either change the action or do this and listen to the incorrect action to make a popup to remind the player of the correct action right now the game doesn't feature any combat but they're planning to add it in a future update i've played the game for over 30 hours and i didn't feel the lack of combat at all there's more than enough to do with building a huge factory and setting up all the supply chains on the whole universe so that brings a very important game design question when making your own games you have to remember that more mechanics and features is not necessarily better sometimes adding more mechanics really just downloads your design and makes the game worse in this example right now the game is excellent if you add a subpar combat system on top then that won't possibly take the player away from the good part of building the factories and make the game actually worse but of course it is also impossible that they implement it in such a way that complements the building and doesn't distract from it so the lesson to you is more mechanics aren't necessarily better and if you do add some new feature make sure it actually improves the game as usual prototyping is always your friend so i look forward to playing this game again in the full release to see how they ended up implementing combat alright so those are my thoughts on dyson sphere program a game made with yinty i definitely love playing this one it's really my kind of game if you're a fan of factory automation management games then this is a must play as a unity developer it is excellent to have this game as an example for the kind of scale that is possible to achieve with the engine by the way this is my second game dev review and i've made a playlist and a steam creator page to group them all my goal is to continue making these to give you some great game design tips using these games as examples check out all of the reviews in the steam curator page or on the playlist if you enjoyed the video and found my thoughts on game design helpful consider liking and subscribing this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com
