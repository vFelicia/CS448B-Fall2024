02:45 - hey everyone how's it going
02:48 - thanks for being here all right
02:54 - all right great
02:56 - all right hey everyone
03:00 - okay let me set this up
03:05 - all right so basically the goal here is
03:08 - lately I've been working on a free
03:10 - expansion to my turn-based strategy
03:12 - course trying to add multi-level support
03:14 - and right now I'm still in the research
03:16 - phase and the one thing that I need to
03:18 - research right now is basically how am I
03:20 - going to handle the pathfinding links
03:22 - for the various Wars as well as how to
03:24 - handle the visibility so that's pretty
03:27 - much my my going for this live stream I
03:29 - need to do this research so I might as
03:31 - well do it live so all right thank you
03:34 - for being here and let's get to it and
03:36 - I'll try to answer as many questions as
03:37 - I can
03:38 - all right okay so first of all just
03:41 - trying it out
03:44 - and
03:46 - yep okay so here is the game pretty
03:48 - basic and basically I implemented can I
03:51 - hide that one okay apparently I hide
03:52 - though uh yeah so I basically just
03:54 - implemented some nice links so this
03:56 - character can go up to the second floor
03:58 - or down to the first one really great
04:00 - all right except the issue right now is
04:02 - that the link is pretty much fixed so
04:05 - that's the first thing that I want to
04:06 - handle
04:07 - I want to be able to but why was that
04:09 - one invisible did I modify that
04:12 - all right I I was testing out the former
04:15 - visibility right that's that's why so
04:17 - let me actually disable this for now
04:19 - I'll work on the visibility afterwards
04:21 - for now I don't want that for now I
04:23 - first just want to
04:25 - handle the pathfinding links so and then
04:27 - when I click I can go up and there you
04:29 - go jumps up and he jumps down okay great
04:34 - uh all right so the first thing that I
04:36 - want is to handle the pathfinding links
04:39 - and for that
04:41 - for some learning to make multiplayer oh
04:44 - that's awesome hey I'm glad you're
04:46 - enjoying it yeah multiplayer used to be
04:47 - so tricky but nowadays thanks to all
04:49 - these awesome tools multiplayer is super
04:52 - easy nowadays well as easy as can be
04:54 - that's it multiplayer is always it's
04:56 - always tricking but thanks to the tools
04:58 - now it is much easier all right
05:01 - watching your videos for I don't know
05:03 - how many years now oh nice thank you
05:04 - thanks for being here for so long but
05:06 - until you're awesome ah thank you hey
05:08 - I'm glad you liked the videos I hope the
05:10 - videos have been very helpful in those
05:12 - so many years all right okay hey and a
05:15 - custom character hey chillies hey nice
05:18 - thanks uh okay right so let me first of
05:21 - all remember how I was handling the
05:23 - pathfinding links
05:26 - so where's my script uh here it is and I
05:29 - had yeah right I made the pathfinding
05:31 - links where I've got the a b and I just
05:34 - made it manually right yep exactly
05:37 - pretty much I got a list of pathfinding
05:39 - links and I just manually created them
05:41 - okay
05:42 - so now I would want
05:45 - uh some way to show this in the editor
05:47 - so let me actually I gotta make it
05:50 - serializable right yeah but let's make
05:52 - first a easy sharp script for the path
05:56 - finding link and call it mono Behavior
05:59 - so that it shows up as a component
06:03 - so that's like ultimate character
06:05 - controller uh personally I normally
06:08 - stick with simpler assets so I prefer
06:10 - assets that do just one tiny thing and
06:12 - do it very well so I'm not necessarily
06:14 - personally I don't really tend to use
06:16 - super complex character controllers that
06:18 - do a billion things but that's just me
06:20 - that really depends some people really
06:21 - like having some pre-made things with
06:24 - tons and tons of features so if you're
06:26 - like that then by all means go ahead and
06:28 - use it so it pretty much depends on do
06:31 - you like doing things from scrunch or do
06:33 - you need something extremely Advanced
06:34 - because if you do something extremely
06:35 - Advanced that is going to take you
06:37 - several months to build then yeah
06:38 - picking up a ready-made tool will
06:40 - definitely helps so yeah basically the
06:42 - answer is depends on you maybe for you
06:44 - it's great or maybe it might be best to
06:46 - build it from scratch so sorry but yeah
06:49 - there's no objective answer uh right so
06:52 - if you're here let me make a serialized
06:54 - film of type pathfinding link for the
06:57 - path
06:58 - training link and I need to mark this as
07:01 - serializable so serialize the bone all
07:04 - right
07:05 - and just with this
07:09 - if there's a screen yeah nice thanks for
07:11 - answering yeah of course uh go to gym
07:13 - yeah of course I love it uh all right so
07:16 - let me try making a simple empty game
07:19 - object for ah crap I press Ctrl P
07:21 - instead of shift p uh for a path finding
07:25 - link
07:26 - and let me add the pathfinding not this
07:29 - one not this one
07:30 - the mono Behavior okay uh
07:34 - oh right is it because it's the
07:38 - it's got grid positions oh right so I
07:40 - need to make the grid position
07:41 - serializable as well
07:43 - all right that's interesting
07:45 - or actually no
07:49 - uh
07:52 - okay that's an interesting question hmm
07:56 - be careful this in dark mode sorry no I
07:58 - can't dark mode burns my eyes if I look
08:00 - at it for more than a second my eyes
08:01 - start to bleed so sorry nope can't do it
08:05 - um right so the issue here is I would
08:08 - like to make a editor tool in order to
08:10 - be able to visualize the grid position
08:11 - links except should I be using great
08:14 - positions I probably shouldn't so you
08:16 - know let me actually modify this
08:18 - so instead of having a puffing link I
08:21 - think I should probably have effective
08:23 - three for the link position a
08:27 - another one for line position B so have
08:29 - this instead of that one
08:33 - and yep now I got two Vector Threes And
08:36 - basically now I'm going to position them
08:37 - okay so this might be best and then I
08:39 - convert those into grid positions and
08:41 - hopefully that should work but
08:44 - okay all right so let's try this and
08:46 - then maybe I will see perhaps the great
08:48 - position works best so anyways just
08:50 - researching so start with this and then
08:52 - we'll see okay so now the thing is I
08:55 - gotta refer to my own tutorial in order
08:57 - to remember
08:58 - how do I add the position handles and
09:02 - apparently I have to use unseen GUI and
09:05 - then use handles.position handle
09:08 - all right so let's try this out but does
09:10 - this have to be in an editor script
09:12 - that's my question
09:14 - private on scene GUI
09:17 - does this one only exist in the editor
09:20 - this is going to throw an error
09:22 - I'm not sure
09:30 - yeah actually editor tools one of those
09:32 - things that haven't really worked with
09:35 - it too much yeah
09:37 - isn't that good considered best solution
09:39 - for a multiplayer I mean what about
09:41 - Photon mirror I've only used netcode so
09:43 - I can only say that one is great
09:45 - depending on the types of games that you
09:47 - want to make but from what I've heard
09:49 - pretty much all of them are excellent so
09:52 - yeah I would say oh why am I playing the
09:54 - game there's no need to play uh yeah
09:56 - pretty much all of those Tunes are
09:58 - excellent nowadays so just pick whatever
10:00 - you want okay so for this one to work I
10:03 - think it does need to
10:07 - so really oh nice awesome hey that's
10:10 - awesome it's actually it's a it's not
10:13 - insanely difficult but it is a very nice
10:15 - challenge yeah working on this expansion
10:17 - has been quite fun uh okay so I think I
10:20 - need an editor
10:22 - and inside I'm going to need the
10:24 - pathfinding mono Behavior editor script
10:29 - and I think like this
10:32 - it should work I just need to make sure
10:34 - using Unity editor
10:36 - and now I need to once again go re-watch
10:40 - my script
10:44 - that's a goal yeah
10:46 - is this course free the turn-based
10:48 - strategy course no that one is paid
10:50 - although I did make a a free tutorial on
10:54 - the first version on the Prototype that
10:56 - I made
10:57 - so if you'd like to see the original
10:59 - prototype that I made before making the
11:01 - entire course you can see that and you
11:03 - can download the project files for that
11:04 - one but yeah the phone step-by-step
11:06 - course that one is a regular paid course
11:08 - uh okay so
11:12 - uh right so I need to watch my own video
11:15 - to remember
11:16 - how do you do
11:18 - the custom editors I don't remember the
11:20 - syntax in the
11:22 - beginning
11:26 - oh is it on the on drug gizmos no I
11:28 - don't think so that's where the jawline
11:30 - that's not what I want
11:31 - nope
11:34 - uh what's the name
11:40 - ah there you go all right so I've got to
11:42 - extend editor and do custom editors all
11:44 - right so let's see syntax that I was
11:45 - looking for
11:47 - so make this of type editor and let's
11:49 - use the not this custom editor
11:52 - of type of and the type is the path
11:56 - finding link mono Behavior
12:01 - all right yep I think it's like this and
12:04 - now I think I should be able to do on
12:06 - scene GUI now this one debug.log if I do
12:10 - a log now I should be able to see the
12:12 - log
12:13 - stripy and Trigger path oh nice
12:15 - that was a fun system yeah it's actually
12:17 - something that is surprisingly easy to
12:19 - do
12:20 - so that's fun yeah I like this and yep
12:23 - there you go got the Unseen okay great
12:25 - uh all right so let me
12:31 - uh
12:32 - okay so I had the Onsen GUI and really
12:36 - the only thing that I needed was yep
12:38 - that's that's the thing the himmel dot
12:39 - position himmel
12:41 - and then I just need to be able to get
12:43 - all right let's see Target okay so let
12:46 - me try to figure out how this works
12:49 - so first of all I grab the Target and
12:52 - the target this is a type object so I'm
12:54 - going to convert this into a path
12:57 - finding link mono Behavior
13:00 - so that's this guy
13:03 - and now with this one I should be able
13:06 - to go is it himmels dot position handle
13:09 - and this one takes a position and a
13:12 - rotation so the position is going to be
13:14 - the pathfinding length Model Behavior
13:15 - Dot uh position a what did I call it
13:21 - all right because uh yeah for editor
13:24 - tools I probably should make these
13:25 - private instead of public just so I can
13:27 - access them from there
13:30 - so over here for the link position a
13:33 - puttering dot identity
13:35 - okay so in theory that should show that
13:37 - one let's see
13:40 - so trying to mess with it from when the
13:42 - multiplayer expansion won't drop uh I
13:45 - don't know I've started researching
13:47 - research I've started writing the
13:49 - beginning parts of it and I've done
13:53 - quite a lot of research so I really just
13:54 - need to handle the length and the
13:56 - visibility
13:57 - then I still gotta write a lot of things
14:01 - so hopefully before the end this month
14:03 - that's pretty much as far as I can say
14:05 - so perhaps in two weeks something like
14:07 - that that's the hope uh okay right so
14:10 - now I do have a second position handle
14:13 - and now I just need to see all right
14:15 - that's the thing I need to do a begin
14:17 - change check this one gives me the new
14:19 - position
14:20 - so effective three this is going to be
14:22 - the new link position a
14:25 - and I need to do what is an editor GUI
14:29 - in order to do a begin change check and
14:32 - then editor GUI dot end change check and
14:35 - this one returns in Boolean if something
14:37 - changes
14:39 - so if something changes let me go into
14:41 - the Pathfinder link Model Behavior the
14:43 - link position a and set it to the new
14:45 - link position a
14:48 - all right I think that's really it do I
14:51 - need to serialize the object I'm not
14:52 - sure
14:55 - specific reason not to use VAR instead
14:56 - of phone class name personally just
14:58 - because I don't like VAR I think I find
15:00 - that VAR tends to obscure the code more
15:03 - than helps so personally I don't really
15:05 - like it I like being extremely explicit
15:08 - but there's nothing inherently wrong
15:10 - with it so if you don't like it then yep
15:12 - by all means go ahead and use it so yeah
15:14 - personally I don't like it but that's
15:16 - just personal preference uh all right
15:19 - okay so this working I can modify this
15:21 - position handle and it shows down so
15:22 - that's great
15:24 - now the one thing is I would like to
15:25 - know how to hide the default pathfinding
15:28 - link position the default game object
15:30 - because that one is pretty useless
15:32 - so I'll have to do some research on how
15:35 - to hide that one but at least this one
15:37 - is working so then I just need to do
15:41 - uh can I do the same thing for the
15:44 - second one so for the pathfinding link
15:46 - position B
15:50 - uh and then I put the B on the new B
15:56 - like this I should be able to change
15:57 - both of them except for that one to move
16:00 - I just need that one to be offset in
16:01 - order to be able to move it and I can
16:03 - move it so now I can put a link over
16:05 - there and put this link roughly over
16:08 - there so I know the Y needs to be on
16:10 - three and then I can position a rough
16:12 - like that so this one is on 6 3 14. 6
16:16 - something and 12. and there you go okay
16:19 - that's the links all right so that's
16:21 - great
16:23 - only from when yeah all right hi thanks
16:26 - for being here all right
16:32 - instead of calling handle why not use an
16:33 - interface I'm not sure what you mean by
16:35 - that what interface does the editor use
16:38 - I'm not sure
16:41 - can convert the URL to MP3 but doesn't
16:44 - seem to work in YouTube links
16:47 - uh I have no idea
16:52 - I mean YouTube links when you access
16:54 - YouTube link it doesn't actually give
16:55 - you a video
16:57 - so you have to somehow seek through the
17:00 - video in order to download on the bytes
17:02 - yeah I don't know for for dealing with
17:05 - HTTP requests I've only done things
17:07 - where I grabbed the entire thing right
17:10 - away so things that have to do with
17:12 - streaming yeah for that sorry I have no
17:15 - idea how down would be handled that is
17:17 - quite tricky
17:20 - uh okay right so
17:22 - okay so that's pretty much all that I
17:25 - need in order to get the editor working
17:27 - hey Desmond says hi hi Desmond uh all
17:30 - right so
17:32 - now that I have this working the next
17:34 - question is how do I put the pathfinding
17:37 - links and I think perhaps a good way is
17:40 - when we go into
17:42 - oh let me actually make a nice function
17:44 - so a public going to return a
17:46 - pathfinding link
17:48 - no not the editor it's not the one that
17:50 - I want the amount of behavior so this
17:52 - one doesn't need the answer going so
17:54 - this one at finding link get pathfinding
17:57 - link
17:58 - and this one going to return going to
18:00 - create a new Pathfinder link and the
18:02 - grid position a level Grid dot instance
18:06 - dot get the grid position on the link
18:09 - position a
18:12 - so I do this same thing for the grid
18:14 - position B
18:17 - and yep that's pretty much it so this
18:19 - Returns the Pathfinder link must stream
18:21 - slightly cool yeah I'm definitely trying
18:22 - to do them a bit more whenever I have to
18:24 - do some research I might as well do it
18:27 - live and try to answer some questions do
18:29 - some things so it's always a bit more
18:30 - fun rather than working alone all the
18:33 - time it's a bit of a different hey
18:34 - greetings from India nice there's links
18:36 - you're making for stairs and such yep
18:38 - these links can be whatever you want so
18:39 - it can be stairs and letters something
18:41 - like that pretty much just connects a
18:42 - position on a grid position on Circle 4
18:45 - to another position then visually that
18:47 - can be whatever you want to be yeah
18:51 - a good way to deal with an after image
18:55 - what do you mean by after image
18:58 - so I'm only thinking about Dragon Ball
19:00 - where you got like
19:02 - and after image where they move really
19:03 - quickly so that would be more of a
19:05 - visual effect so something using the VFX
19:07 - ref
19:08 - so I'm not sure what you mean by that
19:11 - an after image with a permanent mesh
19:14 - I guess maybe you could duplicate a mesh
19:16 - is that what you mean definitely get a
19:17 - mesh and make it kind of like a
19:19 - transparent like the character Trails
19:21 - behind when moving fast yeah I guess
19:23 - that would be one way to do it as the
19:25 - character is moving around you pretty
19:26 - much just copy the mesh
19:28 - you instantiate a new mesh using that
19:30 - mesh data I assume you're working with a
19:32 - skin mesh render and I believe you can
19:33 - work with the with the skin measure and
19:36 - the vertices so yeah I guess that would
19:38 - be it make a simple full timer so every
19:40 - x amount of seconds it just copies the
19:42 - mesh and just creates that mesh on that
19:45 - position as the
19:46 - as the skin mesh really continues going
19:48 - so pretty much just instantiate the
19:50 - brand new fix mesh yeah that would be a
19:53 - funny fact that sounds interesting
19:55 - um
19:57 - uh okay what was I doing uh right so
20:01 - I've got the editor okay so I've got the
20:02 - pathfinding link Model Behavior and
20:04 - basically I just need to let me go into
20:06 - the pathfinding and I think the best way
20:10 - is Let's Make a transform and call it
20:14 - pathfinding link
20:17 - container something like this
20:19 - so then I'm going to go pathfinding link
20:22 - list
20:23 - pathfinding light not the container
20:25 - pathfinding link list annual list okay
20:28 - then for each for each transform
20:31 - pathfinding link transform in the
20:34 - pathfliner link container I cycle
20:36 - through all the children then the
20:38 - pathfinding link transform in order to
20:41 - get the component or try and get
20:42 - components that's probably for the best
20:44 - out of path finding link mono Behavior
20:48 - so out on the final link Model Behavior
20:51 - so I try to do a trigger component on
20:55 - that then I take the pathfinding link
20:56 - mono behavior and I get the pathfinding
20:59 - link and go into the pathfinding link
21:02 - list in order to add this new one and
21:06 - that way I no longer need anything like
21:08 - that
21:09 - all right great okay
21:13 - so this should actually be working very
21:15 - well already now I can easily create all
21:18 - kinds of links okay
21:21 - you keep yourself up to date with new
21:23 - ENT features Yeah by trying I try to
21:26 - read their blog keep up to date with all
21:28 - the news watch various Unity YouTube
21:30 - channels do all kinds of things so yeah
21:33 - I try to keep up to date and of course I
21:35 - got uh contact with the UNT team itself
21:38 - so every time they do something new a
21:39 - lot of times they send me updates
21:41 - directly so yep I try to keep up to date
21:44 - as much as possible
21:46 - mentioning a project with 100 devs who
21:48 - is trying to do that that is definitely
21:50 - tricky yeah that is a whole nother skill
21:52 - set how do you manage a massive team
21:54 - with tons of people doing all kinds of
21:56 - things that is definitely one skill set
21:58 - that I do not have so yeah if you're
22:01 - trying to do that best of luck uh okay
22:04 - so let's make one link there and another
22:06 - one in there so let's put this one on
22:08 - position one
22:10 - and let me make it quite a bit smaller
22:13 - so on the size of four okay let's put a
22:15 - link there and another one there
22:17 - so for that all right I need to make an
22:20 - empty game object for the pathfind thing
22:22 - ah crap I can't write
22:24 - link container
22:27 - let's reset this and now inside I put on
22:29 - the pathway link so I got this one and
22:31 - I'm going to have another one in there
22:33 - and in there so on zero and zero
22:37 - okay so now I've got the super funny
22:39 - links so the character should be able to
22:41 - jump right through here or through here
22:43 - and everything should work
22:44 - okay so my team why is burning while
22:48 - watching oh sorry but the same thing
22:50 - happened to me with dark mode dark mode
22:52 - really burns my eye so that is why I
22:54 - cannot use it uh and obviously as usual
22:57 - I forgot to drag a reference that always
22:59 - happens so let me just drag the
23:01 - container reference and try it out again
23:03 - all right
23:06 - see what GDC conferences yeah so there
23:09 - were I watched a bunch of the unity ones
23:12 - but yeah there are I actually do have a
23:14 - GDC pass with access to the GDC volt so
23:18 - yeah I I've been trying to find the time
23:21 - but hopefully when I do find Tom I can
23:23 - watch some of those awesome talks and
23:25 - look at that it did work
23:27 - right so some of you might not know the
23:30 - importance of what just happened but let
23:31 - me tell you it is quite amazing
23:33 - yeah so essentially I've managed to
23:36 - create
23:37 - pathfinding links let me actually add
23:39 - because I got I keep testing this one
23:41 - with
23:42 - uh where did I add the the things I
23:46 - don't even know yeah the action points
23:47 - let me put it on 10 just so I don't have
23:50 - to test quite a lot
23:57 - all right because yeah this is actually
23:59 - quite amazing so I can take this
24:01 - character and I can jump up to the
24:02 - second floor I can go through here and I
24:05 - can jump down or jump up through this
24:07 - one so yep I've got a nice connection
24:08 - between both of them let's create some
24:10 - more links just to verify that yep
24:12 - everything is indeed working perfectly
24:14 - so where's the pivot on this one
24:16 - let me go down and say yep I want to
24:19 - make another link on that one so put
24:22 - this one on 10 let me duplicate this
24:24 - wall put another one on this 25 and
24:28 - stretch it out a little bit all right so
24:31 - let me just make another pathfinding
24:34 - link
24:34 - and this one I'm gonna fall in there and
24:37 - go up roughly around there so let me put
24:40 - the position so this one's on 8 and 25.
24:45 - oh did I catch it in the middle
24:48 - or no maybe not
24:50 - yeah I think it's 24 yeah I think this
24:52 - one might be a little bit too big it's
24:53 - okay uh 24 and on 10. so on this one let
24:57 - me just
24:58 - yeah this one apparently should be a
25:00 - tiny bit smaller
25:03 - is it 9.5
25:06 - I don't know I guess we shouldn't see it
25:07 - let's test all right
25:10 - give us a link a little graphic at least
25:12 - yeah sure I mean I'm only working on the
25:14 - on the uh functionality of it right now
25:17 - hey and look at that it does work so I
25:20 - can go and now I can jump down through
25:21 - that one and yeah there you go so
25:23 - basically just working on getting the
25:25 - functionality working and yep then
25:27 - obviously you would put some kind of
25:28 - ladder in here instead of the instead of
25:31 - the animation being just a falling down
25:32 - animation you'd have a proper leather
25:34 - climb animation and so on but yep all
25:37 - the logic is indeed working
25:39 - all right great
25:43 - next version of your great tutorial on
25:44 - your site seems like it's missing a step
25:48 - around when you add the TMP debug prefab
25:52 - uh it's been a while since I wrote that
25:55 - so yeah okay sure thanks for the tip on
25:58 - I'll keep that in mind let me write a
26:00 - note here
26:06 - all right I'll keep that in mind thanks
26:10 - okay
26:13 - how'd you make it so each person is
26:14 - watching the video has their character
26:16 - on screen well that's
26:17 - a simple connection with the YouTube API
26:20 - I've got a bunch of tutorials related to
26:22 - that so on this page it's the page where
26:25 - you can customize your character but on
26:27 - the bottom over here I also got links to
26:29 - various tutorials that I made so a
26:31 - tutorials for how I made this
26:33 - transparent DNT window another one for
26:35 - how I made the mesh based animations
26:36 - then how I made an HTTP request from
26:39 - Unity so that's how I'm contacting the
26:40 - YouTube API in order to get the messages
26:42 - and finally these characters these are
26:44 - the ones that I use in my game Battle
26:45 - Royal Tycoon so that's pretty much how I
26:48 - made that okay
26:50 - all right so here I created the links
26:53 - and all of them work so adding new links
26:55 - to this level is super easy just need to
26:57 - add them over here and everything works
26:59 - perfectly all right great you're awesome
27:01 - hey you too nice
27:03 - um
27:04 - right so let me think
27:06 - what else was I trying to do
27:10 - so I got the links right now okay right
27:12 - so another thing that I want is just to
27:14 - make sure that everything does work let
27:15 - me make yet another four so let me
27:18 - duplicate the floor put it up on 6.001
27:22 - just so there's no is that fighting
27:24 - I'll even put it something like this
27:27 - so on 3 31 about 31 32.
27:33 - uh
27:36 - is that it always a bit confused I don't
27:38 - remember when I made the
27:41 - what is the origin
27:43 - right it needs to be on an odd number so
27:46 - yeah this one's actually on 31 I think
27:49 - 31.5 either way just a visual I'll worry
27:53 - about that in a bit so like this
27:57 - okay so pretty much got a second floor
27:59 - there let me just add some more walls so
28:03 - put them on nine enough six
28:05 - all right another one over there so
28:08 - minus
28:10 - minus 1.5
28:13 - yep something like this
28:15 - and definitely get this one put it on
28:17 - six all right so I got a nice third
28:19 - floor
28:20 - and let's also put a wall just so it
28:23 - makes a bit more sense as to how the
28:24 - character is jumping
28:26 - so perhaps on
28:28 - 25 something like that
28:30 - okay
28:33 - let's put it like this
28:35 - just playing around the visuals a little
28:36 - bit all right okay great
28:39 - I think going on dots and ECS uh I think
28:42 - the plan is selling to hit 1.0 by the
28:44 - time that
28:45 - that the LTS version comes out which
28:48 - should be sometime soon I hope they said
28:50 - a few weeks in in
28:53 - um
28:53 - GDC which was quite a while ago so yeah
28:57 - I'm guessing the LTS version should be
28:59 - around anytime now and when it happens
29:02 - yep I think dots 1.0 should be coming
29:05 - out so yep as far as I know everything
29:07 - that is on the plan so it's only works
29:10 - as far as I know it's not a Bend or
29:11 - anything like that all right so
29:15 - so I don't know I need to do is go into
29:18 - my level Grid and instead of being two
29:21 - floors let's put and say this more or
29:24 - less three-fourths and for the link let
29:26 - me make another link and this one lets
29:28 - it connect from there and go up go up on
29:33 - two four six I think
29:35 - let me go and just make sure yep
29:40 - so on 4 24 4 26. all right so got
29:45 - another link so I should be able to go
29:46 - up there so let's see
29:49 - all right
29:52 - okay so let me pick this one up and I
29:55 - can jump onto this link that's great and
29:57 - if there you go I can go there and I can
29:59 - go into this link and I can go into the
30:02 - third form all right that's pretty
30:04 - awesome
30:06 - all right
30:08 - yeah this has been a a fun thing to work
30:11 - on being able to add multiple fours
30:14 - really increase the amount of level
30:15 - complexity that you can build so that is
30:18 - really nice no kitchen chaos mobile
30:20 - controls come uh the answer is whenever
30:22 - I have time that's that's the answer to
30:24 - so many of my projects yep it's
30:27 - definitely on my list so I don't know
30:29 - when but hopefully soon
30:34 - all right okay so the multi-floors did
30:37 - work all right that's great
30:39 - now the next thing that I want to
30:41 - research is how am I going to handle the
30:43 - visibility that is tricky
30:46 - so if you don't have the wall there uh
30:48 - without the wall is just a vision so if
30:50 - I hide this one the link is still there
30:52 - so all that matters is that there's a
30:54 - pathfinding link between these two
30:55 - positions so that's pretty much the only
30:57 - thing that matters
30:59 - so while we're in a wall that's just a
31:01 - visual so you could add a proper uh
31:04 - leather over here you could add a proper
31:06 - leather animation so pretty much just
31:08 - the main thing that I'm working on is
31:10 - just making sure that the logic works
31:11 - and yep then it's up to you up to anyone
31:14 - who wants to implement any kind of
31:16 - visuals on top so it can be whatever you
31:18 - want can be a basic jump animation
31:20 - that's that's what I'm using here just
31:22 - because I don't know how to make
31:23 - animations
31:25 - so yeah that is why over here I just
31:27 - made a super basic animation just
31:29 - jumping up falling down but this
31:31 - animation can be whatever you want so
31:32 - yep
31:34 - so when it comes to climbing Leathers
31:36 - jumping falling down that's really just
31:37 - a visual so it's very easy to add the
31:39 - visuals on top of the logic attention
31:42 - I'm logic so much Ah that's awesome
31:44 - I'm glad the videos have been helpful to
31:46 - you
31:47 - give them jet packs yep you can
31:49 - definitely you could definitely apply
31:51 - some jetpack logic some flying logic
31:53 - pretty much all of that is possible yeah
31:59 - show what it looks like without the wall
32:00 - yeah the wall doesn't doesn't matter so
32:02 - if I disable this one the one object is
32:05 - no longer there but yep it can still go
32:06 - because the link is there so the link is
32:08 - commonly separate from the wall so it
32:09 - has nothing to do with any visuals so I
32:12 - can go and it doesn't have any more
32:13 - action points
32:14 - ah crap now they're going to shoot me oh
32:16 - boy they're gonna take 10 10 steps all
32:19 - right but yeah the wall is just visual
32:21 - so yeah
32:24 - uh okay right so the other thing that I
32:27 - want to research is how am I going to
32:30 - handle the visibility because the issue
32:31 - is there's a floor down here except when
32:34 - I'm up here it's really hard to work
32:36 - with this one so I got to figure out
32:37 - some way of hiding these visuals as the
32:40 - camera Zooms in and zooms out
32:43 - so let's see that all right
32:45 - not a cartoon monkey nope I'm a regular
32:49 - human just like you
32:51 - uh okay right so for that one I was
32:54 - thinking about some kind of floor
32:56 - visibility script that says what floor
32:58 - it is
33:00 - and then in order to either show or hide
33:03 - this one so probably void show in order
33:06 - to make these basic Shore height
33:08 - functions I'm going to work with the
33:12 - game object renders so one just shows
33:14 - one just hides
33:16 - yeah right just the renderer right yeah
33:24 - so
33:26 - yeah the thing that I need to remember
33:27 - is how was I handling the the camera
33:31 - that was tricking
33:35 - one of the few YouTubers you can
33:36 - understand without subtitles so really
33:38 - wow that's awesome sometimes I'm a bit
33:40 - self-conscious about my weird accent but
33:43 - hey if you can understand that's awesome
33:45 - I'm glad you I'm glad you can understand
33:47 - it yeah
33:48 - uh right
33:51 - curiosity do you plan to do tutorial on
33:53 - how to make Rhythm games one day that's
33:56 - a very Niche genre so yeah I don't know
33:58 - about that I definitely enjoy playing
34:00 - them I used to enjoy what was it called
34:03 - Step Mania that was it right yeah that
34:06 - was a really awesome game I was really
34:08 - addicted to that for quite a while
34:11 - so
34:13 - yeah it was that many yeah really
34:15 - awesome so yeah I was really addicted to
34:17 - this playing just with my fingers
34:19 - instead of with the feet but yeah this
34:21 - was really awesome so yeah Rhythm games
34:22 - they are fun but yeah covering them in
34:25 - the tutorial I'm not sure that's a a bit
34:27 - way too Niche that's the thing about
34:28 - YouTube whenever I dedicate some time to
34:31 - a video and the videos always say quite
34:33 - a lot of time several hours so if I'm
34:36 - going to make something I need to
34:38 - I need to choose things that might do
34:40 - well although sometimes I can definitely
34:43 - afford to do some videos that doesn't
34:46 - don't get that many views just for fun
34:47 - but yeah who knows maybe one day I'll
34:49 - uncover that genre I mean if I had
34:51 - infinite time I would love to cover
34:52 - pretty much every genre in existence
34:55 - but yeah suddenly I don't have a time
34:57 - machine so yeah I wish that were
35:00 - possible but not really uh right
35:07 - 2D uh the issue yeah the issue is that
35:10 - unity's nav mesh component that is
35:12 - really made just for 3D so yeah if
35:15 - you're working on 2D nav meshes then
35:18 - really my advice to you is to use the
35:20 - a-star path finding
35:22 - finding
35:24 - so that's my advice pretty much is get
35:27 - the a-star pathfinding asset which
35:29 - actually only they do have the a-star
35:31 - pathfinding project they actually do
35:34 - have a free version that's pretty much
35:37 - how I started when I was first of
35:40 - reverse Bay yeah when I was first
35:41 - working on my first steam game Survivor
35:43 - Squad and obviously I had no money so
35:46 - when I started I was actually using the
35:47 - free version and I only upgraded to the
35:50 - pro version just when I had pretty much
35:52 - the game commonly done so yeah if you're
35:54 - working in 2D pathfinding I would highly
35:56 - encourage you to look into either this
35:58 - one or some other pathfinding solution
36:00 - because yeah as far as I know unity's
36:02 - navmesh really is not built for
36:04 - pathfinding I think they do have
36:07 - uh I think there are some extras that
36:09 - make it support 2D but yeah for the most
36:12 - part yeah I would recommend something
36:13 - like this instead of trying to get down
36:15 - to work
36:17 - uh
36:18 - uh okay so for shooting and hiding
36:21 - basically I just need to remember how
36:22 - was I handling the camera because I
36:24 - don't remember that
36:25 - how did I handle the camera was the
36:28 - camera controller
36:29 - perhaps
36:31 - uh right because this one has the zoom
36:33 - the zoom Target follow offset
36:37 - yep that's what I'm using right yep
36:41 - okay right so I need to access the
36:42 - camera so let me make a public static
36:45 - camera controller for the instance where
36:47 - they get any private set
36:49 - and let's make your prize wide awake and
36:52 - on the way except the instance of this
36:55 - and now I'm going to need a function
36:58 - uh uh float let's say get camera height
37:03 - and I'm going to return the target file
37:05 - offset.y
37:07 - okay
37:09 - so this and now on this one let me go
37:12 - into the camera controller access the
37:15 - instance in order to get the camera
37:16 - height so let's see float for the camera
37:19 - height and now basically on this one I
37:22 - need to Define
37:24 - how am I going to show it but it can't
37:27 - be based just on the floor height
37:31 - yeah because the camera is under no if
37:33 - it is
37:34 - hmm
37:38 - uh
37:39 - [Music]
37:42 - because I got what do I do do I do well
37:45 - let me just do a debug download just to
37:47 - see what the camera height doesn't like
37:49 - and then see
37:51 - about other engines compared to Unity I
37:53 - think nowadays as developers we are
37:55 - really spawned for choice because pretty
37:58 - much every single engine is excellent so
38:00 - yeah personally I love unity I keep
38:03 - using Unity because it's an excellent
38:05 - engine can do anything that I want to do
38:07 - but thankfully nowadays pretty much all
38:09 - the engines are great so pretty much
38:12 - just pick one and start learning it okay
38:15 - why is this not updating or is it zoomed
38:18 - up okay it's it was zoomed in uh
38:21 - right so essentially
38:23 - uh
38:25 - yeah do I do it plus one
38:28 - so when it's on four I want to hide
38:30 - these visuals is that what I'm going to
38:31 - do
38:32 - uh uh all right
38:36 - okay so let's define a float for the
38:39 - show height
38:42 - and basically I'm going to show if the
38:44 - camera height
38:46 - it is bigger than what's going to level
38:48 - Grid and get the four Heights
38:55 - plus some offsets is that what I do yeah
38:57 - I think
38:58 - yeah
38:59 - float for the uh for height offset
39:05 - something like this
39:08 - so won't show height if that one is
39:11 - above that one
39:14 - so if you'll hide then I'm going to show
39:17 - and if not then I'm going to hide
39:21 - okay all right so let's try it out and
39:24 - see if this works
39:30 - position on a 3D pathfinding solution
39:34 - oh that's what do you mean by 3D do you
39:36 - mean like grids like voxel grids or 3D
39:40 - terrain because rain is essentially flat
39:44 - the question is do you have positions
39:46 - above other or other positions because
39:48 - terrain we're just going up then
39:50 - essentially you just need a a flat
39:52 - pathfinding solution so that one pretty
39:54 - much anything works I mean either way I
39:56 - would always recommend the Acer
39:57 - pathwaying project I was telling you
39:59 - about that a while ago so either way
40:01 - that's the main one that I would
40:02 - recommend
40:03 - for pathfinding for super simple things
40:06 - yeah sure I would use uh unity's
40:09 - built-in navmesh but for anything more
40:10 - complex for pathfinding that's pretty
40:13 - much what I would do
40:15 - Rhythm games are more than just DDR
40:17 - equipment yeah I yeah beat saber is
40:20 - definitely some that I love I spend a
40:22 - lot of time so yeah it's another one
40:24 - those things where if I had a time
40:26 - machine I would love to be able to have
40:27 - infinite time in order to spend some
40:30 - time researching VR and yep I'd love to
40:32 - make some kind of beat saber clone to
40:33 - really see how it works
40:35 - so yeah that's another one of those
40:37 - things that is permanently on my to-do
40:39 - list and hopefully one day I should I
40:42 - will hopefully be able to get it someday
40:44 - maybe
40:45 - uh okay
40:47 - so if I go in if there go at some point
40:50 - that one disappears all right okay so I
40:53 - think
40:55 - yeah pretty much just play around the
40:56 - offset but at least the logic is right
40:58 - there
41:00 - so now the question is do I apply this
41:04 - yeah I think that's kind of the issues
41:06 - that I have to manually apply this
41:08 - component
41:09 - to every single object
41:13 - yeah that's the
41:15 - that's the only downside of this I think
41:18 - now that I need to manually add this to
41:20 - every single one so I paste component as
41:24 - new so all of these are on the first
41:25 - floor this one is also on the first
41:27 - floor and now this one up here this one
41:30 - is going to be on the second floor now
41:32 - let me copy this component
41:35 - and on this one this one in this one
41:38 - these are also on the second floor right
41:42 - oh did I add to this one already no that
41:44 - one you don't have a two let me remove
41:47 - this one
41:48 - that one is on two
41:50 - that one is also on two why did I add to
41:51 - this one
41:53 - oh then I add to the base one
41:57 - okay that I don't work oh right because
41:59 - I split down I think anyways
42:02 - all right so
42:03 - yeah the components are a bit
42:06 - on it's a bit manual but let's see if
42:09 - this works all right
42:11 - so time to learn how to juggle with a
42:13 - pen well I learned that like 15 years
42:15 - ago that is why I pretty much just know
42:16 - two tricks but yeah that's not something
42:20 - that I've learned recently
42:24 - integrate manager that holds on four
42:26 - references yep definitely right now I'm
42:28 - just focused on trying to get it working
42:30 - and then I'll worry about making it
42:32 - performing but yep so far so here is the
42:34 - third floor and as I zoom in
42:37 - and all right because this one's on the
42:39 - second floor
42:41 - but is that one
42:44 - okay that one should be hiding but it's
42:47 - not hiding let me put the scene view
42:48 - side by side or to be able to see what
42:51 - is happening
42:53 - yeah why is that one not
42:56 - yeah they all vanish at once why
43:00 - did I not put it on too I did put oh
43:02 - never mind I didn't multiply it right so
43:05 - the four height times the what did I
43:08 - quality for
43:12 - and pause the offset okay that is why
43:15 - the second one wasn't working all right
43:19 - tried using UI token I've done some
43:21 - research on it and it does seem
43:24 - uh it was already very stable very much
43:27 - production ready when I first saw it
43:29 - when I first saw when I last saw it
43:31 - which was several months ago so yeah by
43:33 - now I would say that one is probably
43:34 - very close to production ready so yeah
43:38 - I won't that's another one of those
43:39 - things as soon as I have the time yep I
43:41 - definitely want to make a tutorial in
43:43 - order to figure out how it actually
43:44 - works okay so I think I should increase
43:46 - the think about a little bit otherwise
43:48 - it's a bit too hard
43:50 - but yeah only four height offset let's
43:52 - put it on 2f
43:54 - and I just need to on the camera
43:55 - controller also make it zoom out by a
43:57 - little bit more so instead of tovaf
43:59 - let's put it 15f okay
44:02 - programming is so interesting yes it is
44:04 - that's why I love it it's a never-ending
44:07 - challenge you can do anything you can
44:09 - build anything as long as you have the
44:11 - skills for it anything goes that is
44:13 - really awesome
44:15 - had a chance to play Tears against them
44:17 - yet nope I did go ahead and pick it up
44:19 - actually got it here
44:21 - got a nice
44:23 - where's my camera yeah nice so yeah when
44:26 - to pick up the copy earlier this morning
44:28 - but yeah still trying to get a bunch of
44:31 - work done so that I can then go play a
44:33 - little bit so yeah hopefully in a little
44:36 - bit after this live stream yep that's
44:37 - the plan try to do it see what it does I
44:40 - really love playing breath of wild so
44:42 - yeah this year was my my switch was
44:45 - essentially dead because I hadn't uh
44:48 - I mean the last time I used it was when
44:51 - was it yeah Pokemon let's go Pikachu was
44:55 - that the one which wasn't like three
44:56 - years ago yeah that was the last time
44:58 - that I used my switch so yeah pretty
44:59 - much just played breath one Mario and
45:03 - that Pokemon game yeah so
45:05 - so yeah because that my switch was
45:07 - essentially dead I was trying to get it
45:09 - alive while ago and yep in a little bit
45:11 - I want to go play uh right
45:14 - so yep the visibility isn't it working
45:16 - so I can see everything happening on the
45:19 - third floor I can zoom in in order to
45:21 - see everything happening on this one and
45:23 - zoom down and I see everything happening
45:25 - on this one all right that's pretty
45:27 - great
45:34 - you see making an RPG game is worth it
45:36 - nowadays sure I mean RPG means a ton of
45:39 - things so
45:41 - yeah it really depends on what you mean
45:43 - by that but in general yep RPG can
45:46 - definitely still be I mean depends on
45:48 - your target platform it really depends
45:49 - on what you mean but yeah there are
45:51 - plenty of very successful RPGs if you
45:53 - ask about Platformers then at that point
45:55 - I would say probably not because that's
45:57 - really difficult
45:58 - but RPGs RPGs usually kind of like a
46:01 - sub-genre or like a secondary genre so
46:04 - yeah you can apply RPG mechanics to tons
46:06 - of other genres so yeah
46:09 - video on how you quickly navigate around
46:10 - visual script yeah or not visual script
46:13 - visual studio uh yeah I thought about
46:16 - making a video on the most used
46:18 - shortcuts but yeah for the most part uh
46:22 - actually most things aren't really
46:24 - Visual Studio like just move instead of
46:26 - moving the cursor one one character at a
46:28 - time you press Ctrl and it goes by the
46:31 - entire word so this alone is super
46:33 - useful so that and shift that is really
46:35 - useful for selecting a bunch of things
46:37 - then just knowing you how to select and
46:39 - and so on then I've got a an extension
46:42 - which actually helps me move the cursor
46:44 - up and down by about five lines so this
46:46 - is really good for quickly moving up or
46:48 - quick one moving down
46:50 - then what else being able to have
46:52 - control Dash in order to open up
46:54 - something else so path finding and there
46:57 - you go I can open up the pathfinding
46:58 - script
46:59 - then what else control tab in order to
47:02 - swap between them
47:04 - uh you can do control RR in order to
47:07 - rename things so yeah I definitely would
47:09 - like to do a video on a bunch of those
47:12 - shortcuts because yeah learning how to
47:14 - use your IDE properly that definitely
47:16 - helps you in your uh and becoming a lot
47:19 - more efficient so yeah that's definitely
47:21 - something quite
47:23 - uh quite useful to know all right
47:26 - uh
47:31 - this become an update for turn-based
47:33 - strategy course yep that's exactly it so
47:34 - I'm pretty much just researching in
47:36 - order to be able to do the next free
47:38 - course expansion so yep
47:44 - the engine is good for self-expression
47:46 - system create for independent developers
47:48 - yeah I mean it's amazing that you can
47:51 - do pretty much anything with unity and
47:54 - with any game engine that is actually
47:56 - quite amazing do you have any thoughts
47:57 - on Visual Studio versus jetbrains uh I
48:00 - don't know I don't have any I've heard
48:02 - great things about chat brings writer
48:04 - but personally I haven't tried it
48:06 - because simply because I mean uh Visual
48:09 - Studio already does everything that I
48:10 - want to do so that is why I pretty much
48:13 - have no reason to try to switch because
48:16 - I mean pretty much is I just use the IDE
48:18 - mostly just for writing code I don't use
48:20 - any special features or abilities or
48:22 - something like that so yeah for the most
48:25 - part I've only used Visual Studio but I
48:27 - have heard great things from writer so
48:29 - if you don't like it then yep go ahead
48:31 - and use it okay
48:33 - dude those guys walking on the motor
48:35 - party screen that's just interaction
48:36 - with the YouTube API so if you go on to
48:40 - this page down here at the bottom I've
48:43 - got the various tutorials where I cover
48:44 - the various things so it's a transparent
48:46 - TNT window the characters are some mesh
48:48 - based animation and they're just
48:50 - interacting with YouTube API with an
48:51 - HTTP request that's pretty much it
48:54 - uh all right so honestly these two tasks
48:57 - were pretty much the only things that I
48:59 - want to do for this live stream so
49:02 - I guess I could see yeah I guess I could
49:04 - see okay so what is the best way for me
49:07 - to handle this
49:11 - see that's actually an interesting
49:12 - question with regards to
49:15 - uh performance
49:18 - is this a concern or not how long
49:20 - actually let's oh why don't I try
49:23 - finding out let's open up the analysis
49:25 - the profiler
49:27 - and let me put on the Deep profile
49:31 - to make it so instead of making them
49:33 - invisible you just lower that opacity uh
49:35 - for that basically you would need to
49:36 - work with the with the material and
49:40 - actually
49:41 - I was thinking of not doing that because
49:43 - it's a bit
49:44 - too complicated but honestly it might
49:47 - not be as complicated and let me just
49:48 - see
49:49 - if I can easily access yeah that's the
49:52 - issue because this one doesn't take that
49:55 - one into account yeah that's a problem
49:58 - basically the way you do it would be by
50:00 - modifying the alpha
50:01 - but yeah this Shader that that I use
50:06 - over here this Shader does not support
50:08 - changing the alpha so that is kind of
50:10 - the issue
50:12 - basically the way you do it you wouldn't
50:14 - lure the alpha in order to make it a lot
50:16 - more transparent
50:18 - but yeah if this one does not support
50:19 - the iPhone
50:21 - because yeah it doesn't so suddenly yeah
50:23 - that makes it quite a bit more tricky
50:25 - yeah
50:27 - oh it's super chat name thank you thanks
50:29 - so much thermal vibration or using a
50:31 - tune sound Shader with the latest couple
50:34 - with the latest couple LTS after a
50:37 - bigger project I keep getting GPU
50:38 - Timeout on a 40 series
50:41 - GPU timeout what do you mean by that
50:44 - when doing uh light map baking is that
50:47 - it
50:49 - I mean that's going to depend on how big
50:51 - is your world but yeah
50:54 - yeah I'm using the
50:56 - the uh there's the asset store
51:00 - oh actually I got it or no because I
51:03 - didn't yeah I didn't make a thing on it
51:06 - but yeah I'm using
51:07 - quimly
51:09 - or squiggly
51:12 - quickly
51:14 - so yep that's the
51:16 - asset then I was using pre-grade
51:19 - stylized Shader so if you want to make
51:22 - things nice and size then this Shader is
51:24 - pretty great has tons of options
51:26 - so yeah
51:28 - and if you're having issues with
51:32 - yeah GPU timeout
51:36 - swap chain yeah I'm pretty sure I've
51:37 - seen that error that's annoying uh but
51:40 - yeah if the issues with like baking then
51:42 - the answer is start off on the lowest
51:43 - settings possible and then slowly
51:45 - increase them pretty much
51:48 - otherwise I'm not sure what you mean by
51:50 - GPU timeout
51:56 - can you please explain the gaps between
51:57 - unity and real I mean those are
51:59 - different engines
52:01 - gaps I don't know I don't know enough
52:03 - about unreal to know what it lacks I
52:06 - know that Unity is a bit behind on the
52:09 - super high-end things CNT is currently
52:11 - working on some pretty amazing the uh
52:13 - what what did I call the Adaptive Pro
52:16 - volumes
52:18 - so they're working on a
52:21 - not crap they're working on
52:24 - something to essentially compete with
52:26 - Lumen and this one does seem quite
52:28 - impressive
52:30 - so yeah that's that would be one gap
52:33 - which is how unreal already has Lumen
52:35 - whereas Unity is only beginning to work
52:37 - on it but at least the things that they
52:39 - are working it does seem quite
52:40 - impressive
52:41 - there was a gift with everything working
52:44 - in action
52:47 - right here on this one you can play
52:49 - around
52:50 - yeah you can do a bunch of things so
52:52 - yeah this one is Stone development but
52:54 - it looks
52:56 - really great yeah I can't wait for this
52:57 - signal to come out to
52:59 - to the um
53:02 - to urp right now it's already available
53:03 - on the egrp but for me I use Erp for the
53:06 - most part so that is why
53:09 - oh that's super chat thank you uh with
53:12 - flat kid heavy GPU swap chain air with
53:14 - uplines
53:17 - okay I'm not sure I've never seen that
53:19 - error
53:21 - I mean it will have some workload
53:23 - depending on how many objects how many
53:25 - outlines you're adding
53:27 - but
53:30 - yeah with the flat kit yeah I haven't
53:32 - used that one but as far as I know that
53:33 - one is supposed to also be pretty good
53:35 - isn't it
53:37 - yeah it's this one
53:39 - yeah I haven't used this one I've only
53:41 - used quimly and pixelizer and a bunch of
53:43 - others so I haven't used this one
53:45 - specifically but I would assume they
53:47 - have some optimizations in order to make
53:49 - it work
53:50 - on just uh
53:52 - on just one dracon so
53:55 - yeah I'm not sure I've never used it so
53:58 - yeah I don't know if it has any issues
54:00 - with
54:01 - heavy work mode Unity repent and crashes
54:04 - yeah that's on because this one has tons
54:06 - of positive reviews so I don't know
54:08 - maybe try contacting the developer I
54:11 - don't know something like that
54:14 - um
54:17 - Okay so
54:19 - all right so I was thinking so should I
54:22 - upgrade this or not
54:24 - because I like the all right that's what
54:26 - I was doing I forgot to get a bit
54:28 - distracted for a while but yeah
54:30 - essentially I wanted to open up the
54:32 - analysis the profiler in order to enable
54:34 - the profile let's not record and let's
54:36 - head on play
54:37 - hey good morning
54:39 - uh
54:41 - uh let's just start playing all right
54:43 - let me select this one
54:45 - and let's now hit on record
54:48 - yeah right now they shouldn't
54:51 - oh crap something went
54:53 - wrong or did I pause oh I just like it
54:56 - once all right
54:57 - so I pick one
55:01 - and uh that's the thing does this have
55:04 - yeah it does have a search okay good so
55:06 - I was trying to see okay how am I going
55:07 - to find my script just in case this one
55:09 - isn't too intense because right away I'm
55:12 - looking at times in milliseconds right
55:15 - away it does not seem to be intense at
55:17 - all but let's see
55:19 - so the four visibility
55:22 - yeah it is literally taking 0.0 so yeah
55:27 - so this kind of I guess this is a good
55:29 - example as to when should you worry
55:31 - about updating something and when you
55:33 - shouldn't because basically this script
55:35 - this script that I wrote here this one
55:37 - is technically it's technically not very
55:39 - performant because running this script
55:41 - on every update on every single object
55:43 - that has one of those components
55:45 - attached so supposedly this isn't super
55:47 - performant but at the same time as you
55:49 - can see it is literally taking 0.00
55:51 - milliseconds so whilst technically this
55:54 - isn't very performant well secondly you
55:56 - could definitely optimize this
55:58 - as you can see if it is on 0.0 then
56:00 - probably there's no reason why you
56:02 - should waste time optimizing so yeah
56:08 - uh all right so let me actually open up
56:11 - something else since this one
56:13 - was actually easier than I thought let
56:16 - me actually go into the ugc project in
56:18 - order to see a bunch of things
56:20 - want to learn in real engine can I
56:23 - suggest some coursework no sorry
56:25 - I only know about Unity so yeah this is
56:28 - the wrong channel to ask about in real
56:30 - stuff
56:30 - uh right but how would you optimize it I
56:34 - mean you would basically have just one
56:35 - manager component where it would cycle
56:37 - through all of them and pretty much you
56:39 - would only grab the camera height once
56:41 - it would only do the calculations for
56:43 - the floor height ones you would only
56:46 - call the show if it was actually hidden
56:47 - it would only come to hide if it was
56:49 - shown so yeah there are plenty plenty of
56:51 - ways to pretty much optimize this to
56:53 - make sure that all of these things don't
56:55 - run tons and tons of times and only run
56:57 - as many times as needed
56:59 - so yeah tons of things you could do to
57:02 - really improve upon this
57:07 - so much oh crap let's uh open up the
57:10 - project on the other one
57:18 - send one video on how to connect Dynamic
57:20 - utilities like the conveyor belts
57:25 - Dynamic utility I mean the issue with
57:27 - that is that it's a very specific thing
57:30 - meaning that it's very specific to a
57:32 - specific game so making something
57:35 - generic about
57:37 - how to connect a power system to a
57:39 - conveyor belt system yeah that's kind of
57:41 - the issue that's always that's one of
57:43 - the problems with making tutorials is
57:44 - how do I make it appealing to not just
57:47 - one type of person but many people how
57:49 - do I make it useful to several people so
57:52 - yeah that's a
57:53 - that's the tricky part but yeah for the
57:55 - most part it's really you just got a
57:57 - list of items and you somehow interact
58:00 - with that list by doing something like
58:02 - having power consumers and Power
58:04 - emitters something like that so yeah
58:07 - that's a it's a fun system to make I
58:09 - definitely enjoyed making it but yeah
58:11 - making a tutorial on that is quite a bit
58:13 - tricky
58:14 - to manage to get the modding stuff
58:16 - working yep I didn't uh the main thing
58:18 - that was missing was just the how do I
58:21 - unload the
58:22 - the things
58:28 - showing how to build connections between
58:30 - the nodes I mean for the most part that
58:32 - is really just a list of
58:34 - no day node B each node has a position
58:37 - and then visually you draw a list so you
58:40 - draw a line between them so
58:43 - the visual part or the in logic part is
58:46 - around just a list and the visual part
58:47 - can be whatever you want so yeah it's a
58:51 - trying to figure out a nice way to
58:52 - present that in a tutorial that is a bit
58:54 - of the tricky part
58:57 - um
58:57 - yeah sure so I was working on the on the
59:00 - modding and it did work quite well so
59:04 - basically end up the main issue was with
59:06 - the with the meshes and now I don't
59:09 - remember how I was doing it right
59:12 - uh
59:13 - uh yeah because I don't like this yeah
59:15 - so I got the save and then I got the
59:17 - load and it does actually work right
59:19 - yeah I come into this one out hey good
59:21 - morning
59:22 - um
59:23 - Yeah so basically the way that I made
59:25 - work was by using I try to look into how
59:28 - it was possible to unload an uh obj at
59:31 - runtime and the only way that I could
59:33 - find was using a free
59:37 - the obj Importer
59:41 - what was it called
59:42 - yeah I think it was this one
59:44 - it was right
59:48 - uh
59:49 - yeah right it was this one so yeah
59:51 - apparently Unity does not have a
59:53 - built-in way of working but apparently
59:55 - with that asset I can essentially take a
59:57 - path for some kind of mesh obj data and
60:00 - I can take down I can load it import it
60:03 - convert it into a mesh then on that mesh
60:05 - I can grab the mesh status so the versus
60:07 - triangles and UVS and then with that
60:09 - mesh data I can convert that into Json
60:12 - then that Json I convert them to bytes
60:14 - so obviously this is not the most uh
60:17 - optimized way of doing it but it does
60:19 - work convert that into a bytes and save
60:21 - the whole thing so basically on my demo
60:24 - here so let me actually stop this one or
60:26 - this one
60:28 - and on this one it actually did work
60:30 - hey once again thanks for the super
60:32 - chant sorry I couldn't be more helpful
60:34 - but yeah try to contact the dev that is
60:37 - probably the best thing you can do
60:39 - [Music]
60:39 - um
60:40 - right so here if I go what about
60:42 - materials and shaders and stuff uh
60:44 - basically for this type of mudding I'm
60:45 - just using textures so there you go open
60:48 - up and here I have a nice little uh what
60:52 - was it a battery right
60:53 - yeah so I added this battery component
60:56 - and it worked perfectly basically just
60:58 - got the battery and then I've got the
61:00 - texture
61:02 - and I pretty much just take both those
61:03 - and I convert those into this my mod
61:06 - file or not this one this one byte save
61:08 - so this is pretty much the mod file so
61:10 - just 1.7 megabytes which contains this
61:12 - contains the recipe that's on and so on
61:17 - so yeah this actually worked out pretty
61:19 - well
61:21 - so the ugc
61:23 - uh research did go quite well
61:27 - uh
61:29 - yep it does simplify quite a bit so this
61:31 - is actually quite good all right so yeah
61:33 - the ugc video hopefully that should be
61:35 - out soon I still need to talk with the
61:37 - ugc
61:38 - ugc team in order to figure out if it
61:41 - does work and yeah for the turn based
61:44 - strategy This research was actually
61:46 - quite helpful so I did manage to do that
61:49 - now I just need to write some notes in
61:50 - order to start writing the lectures for
61:52 - the course
61:53 - and then the free update should be out
61:55 - sometime before the end of this month
61:57 - but yeah this was quite fun
62:01 - hey thanks for the Super Chat blender to
62:04 - UNT portal is great experimental
62:07 - with this experiment there's a package
62:09 - blender to Unity what is the blender TNT
62:12 - portal blender to Unity portal
62:16 - is that a thing or are you just saying
62:17 - about about importing things
62:23 - Oh you mean it exports directly from
62:25 - blender into Unity right but for modding
62:29 - basically what I need is I need a a file
62:32 - and you have an okay so yeah yeah
62:34 - basically for modding I just need a
62:36 - separate file just to have the mesh data
62:38 - that I need to dynamically be able to
62:40 - unload that file in order to create the
62:41 - mod so that other people can load that
62:43 - so yeah that's the tricky part is making
62:45 - it work without having blender or any
62:48 - kind of 3D modeling in the mix
62:50 - all right
62:52 - can we see your dog when you're done
62:53 - working I mean they're asleep so I don't
62:56 - think so but yeah I gotta I gotta figure
62:58 - out a way to have multiple cameras and
63:01 - yeah then I could point one at them and
63:03 - that would be a fun second live stream
63:05 - camera uh
63:07 - [Music]
63:08 - all right so yeah so over here the
63:10 - multiform wars expansion it is working
63:12 - quite well
63:14 - even though yeah the uh
63:17 - yeah in terms of performance adding a
63:19 - third level
63:21 - really does make it quite a bit slower
63:25 - yeah that's kind of the issue so perhaps
63:27 - it won't be a third expansion perhaps
63:30 - working on some performance improvements
63:33 - because yeah on this one yeah you can
63:35 - see a little a little sluggish whenever
63:38 - the character moves a different grid
63:39 - position it definitely slows down by
63:42 - quite a bit and that's just basically
63:43 - because over here look at all these game
63:46 - objects of the grid system visual yeah
63:48 - this really should be a mesh
63:50 - so yeah definitely need to
63:53 - figure out how to optimize that quite a
63:55 - bit but yeah the logic for having
63:57 - multiple fours isn't it working so here
63:59 - I have a third form I can even zoom in
64:01 - zoom out oh right I need to
64:03 - sort that out
64:05 - oh that's actually a good question
64:08 - I guess so I put them on the characters
64:10 - themselves because I can take this
64:12 - character
64:13 - and I can go
64:15 - all the way over there
64:21 - right so I can move oh on the floor I
64:25 - also need to
64:27 - okay
64:31 - all right so
64:36 - okay trying to think how do I handle
64:38 - this
64:40 - because then I use a mesh render let me
64:43 - actually so I thought this one was
64:45 - yeah I guess right I need the
64:48 - renderer so I think this one is actually
64:50 - already
64:51 - should already be working so if I take
64:53 - the unit inside I take the character
64:58 - not the character but the uh actual skin
65:02 - mesh render and over here I add the
65:04 - other one
65:06 - so what did I add what did I called I
65:09 - don't remember the name D4 visibility
65:13 - so ah crap where's the
65:17 - the floor visibility
65:19 - okay let me just update this just to
65:22 - make another one so bull Dynamic for
65:26 - position
65:30 - all right new super chant
65:33 - oh hey thanks again it's called Mish
65:35 - sync Works vice versa in real time
65:38 - so that's for what let's say
65:40 - blender mesh sink
65:44 - oh it's a yinty thing
65:46 - wow that looks interesting
65:49 - synchronizing meshes and models
65:55 - wait so you can edit it inside Unity
66:00 - oh I guess it goes both ways is that the
66:02 - thing
66:06 - create a server and connects to it
66:12 - okay that seems interesting
66:15 - okay
66:18 - yeah I have no I have no experience with
66:21 - or I don't have much experience with
66:23 - blender 3D modeling those kinds of
66:25 - things
66:26 - so yeah I can't tell exactly what is
66:29 - impressive but yep it doesn't look great
66:31 - to be able to essentially animate and be
66:33 - able to see all the key points all of
66:35 - them positioned perfectly yeah that does
66:37 - sound quite interesting nice
66:41 - okay
66:43 - KD 3 might be handy here yep in order to
66:45 - handle that visibility but actually the
66:47 - issue is not quite so much with finding
66:50 - the things to show and hide the issue is
66:52 - basically that right now on the grid
66:54 - positions on the floor all of them are
66:55 - instantiated so that is why that is the
66:59 - thing that takes the most amount of time
67:01 - is that it actually has like a thousand
67:04 - individual game objects of them being
67:06 - shown hidden and so on
67:08 - it's personal to somehow open the file
67:09 - manager in unity and get it to work in
67:11 - the exportable
67:12 - uh maybe you can work with the uh with
67:17 - the windows API maybe if you work with
67:19 - that directly it might be able to work
67:21 - but yeah I'm not entirely sure usually
67:25 - for a file manager inside your game you
67:27 - really have to build it yourself so you
67:29 - have to use the regular c-sharp things
67:31 - in order to
67:32 - grab the folders grab the files and show
67:34 - them somewhere in the game
67:36 - but technically using the the windows
67:39 - API might work so that's pretty much the
67:42 - same thing as how I create the
67:43 - characters down here so the transparency
67:45 - window overlay this one works by
67:47 - interacting directly with the windows
67:49 - API
67:50 - so yeah yes that's what it where I would
67:53 - try to see how that works
67:58 - so you've turned the link transforms
67:59 - into Vector 3 points on a singling the
68:02 - issue isn't the link transforms it's
68:04 - with the the line Transformers they're
68:06 - not causing any issues the issue with
68:08 - the Slowdown is run just the the visuals
68:11 - because all of these visuals they are
68:13 - all individual game objects so as I
68:15 - select all of these these are all
68:17 - individual game objects and that is
68:19 - obviously very costly to have thousands
68:21 - of these so as I got three forwards I
68:23 - essentially got can I enable them yeah I
68:25 - can show them out once but yeah pretty
68:27 - much all these positions up here
68:30 - let me see where's this one yeah there
68:32 - you go that position is in there in
68:33 - there and so on look at all of these
68:35 - tons and tons of them
68:37 - so this one for example which is on a
68:40 - place where it doesn't even exist
68:41 - [Music]
68:42 - but all right let's see red white it's
68:45 - the mesh render
68:46 - yeah look at this one that one isn't
68:47 - even a position that has reachable but
68:49 - the way that it works right now it's not
68:50 - even testing for anything so one quick
68:53 - optimization would be to only create the
68:55 - visuals on external walkable positions
68:58 - so that would work
69:00 - but the main thing is really just
69:02 - convert all these Visions onto a tile
69:04 - map so it's kind of what I did when I
69:06 - made the town map quite a long time ago
69:10 - uh Yep this one the custom tile map
69:12 - so on this one pretty much all of these
69:14 - positions make up just a single mesh so
69:17 - that's pretty much how we do it if I
69:18 - wanted to improve the performance on
69:20 - this one
69:21 - pretty much just convert them all into a
69:23 - single mesh
69:24 - and that would be quite a lot more
69:26 - performance
69:29 - and to only create them when the
69:31 - character is selected Maybe
69:34 - sure if you use the object pulling then
69:37 - instantiating just these ones that could
69:40 - work but uh yeah uh anyway so let me
69:44 - just fix this my voice is already messed
69:46 - up so I'm gonna go in a bit
69:51 - let me just quickly try to get this to
69:52 - work so that when I have a character and
69:56 - I go up there and over here as I zoom it
69:59 - hides the walls but it does not hide
70:01 - that player so I want to hide that
70:02 - player
70:06 - so over here can we do Dynamic
70:09 - pathfinding is in real time
70:11 - I don't know what you mean by that
70:12 - because pathfinding is always in real
70:15 - time
70:16 - so I'm not internally sure
70:19 - what you mean by that
70:23 - do you mean modifying the pathfinding
70:25 - because that's kind of what I'm this
70:27 - game already has that so of these all of
70:30 - these positions these are unwalkable
70:32 - because there's something on it without
70:34 - baking navmesh well then you
70:38 - so you're talking about actually
70:39 - modifying the padlock for example over
70:41 - here this position is not walkable but
70:43 - if I throw grenade over there that one
70:45 - is destroyed and yep no this position is
70:47 - now wonkable so that's just updating the
70:49 - actual word position so that depends on
70:50 - what Pathfinder you're using if you're
70:52 - using navmesh then if you have to rebake
70:54 - the position wherever things change and
70:57 - if you're using something like I'm using
70:59 - here so a grid pathfinding system that
71:01 - that depends on how you handle the Grid
71:02 - in this case it is really as simple as
71:05 - the um
71:07 - path node is that what I called it the
71:09 - path node just swapping his Wonka bone
71:11 - from fonsi 2 and yep there you go it
71:13 - becomes walkable alright so let me just
71:16 - quickly sort this out so
71:19 - on the floor visibility I've got the
71:21 - dynamic 4 position
71:24 - so if this one is true if so then let's
71:28 - go into four level Grid
71:30 - instance dot get floor
71:33 - I think just like this it should work
71:36 - that this transformed that position
71:40 - So based on like this if that one is on
71:44 - that one
71:45 - you have video on this grid navigation
71:48 - system yep I mean I have a
71:51 - step by step ah step-by-step thing in
71:54 - the phone course but if you want just
71:56 - the pathfinding then yep I've covered
71:58 - the Asar pathway algorithm and how it
72:00 - works it's a very fascinating algorithm
72:02 - takes a while to click but yeah then
72:04 - it's really powerful Yep this is using a
72:06 - star yep uh right so
72:10 - let's see if this modification changes
72:12 - once again thanks so so much for the
72:14 - super channel for the nice tool hint
72:17 - that was nice all right so jump into
72:19 - that one and as I go
72:21 - and no oh right because wait three no
72:26 - because he is hiding but he only hides
72:32 - oh wait
72:33 - no that makes no sense
72:40 - why is this one
72:43 - uh I guess depends on the transformed
72:45 - opposition
72:46 - yeah what position does this one have
72:48 - that's the question
72:52 - okay let me try this out
72:55 - or maybe I just didn't change it yeah
72:57 - probably just yeah of course I just
72:59 - forgot to tell the bullion that would do
73:01 - it all right
73:06 - so let me go up there and as I zoom in
73:09 - if they go it hides the walls and also
73:11 - the player now I just need to apply it
73:13 - over there to that one but yep that's
73:15 - pretty much it
73:17 - and yeah I guess I also need a Tylenol
73:19 - for because right now I would not be
73:22 - able to click underneath because the
73:24 - clicks would be blocked right
73:27 - so if I go there now I try to walk on
73:31 - that lower floor
73:32 - and right now if I zoom in I can't see
73:35 - it but I cannot click on it because I'm
73:37 - actually clicking on top of that so I
73:40 - need to go underneath and now it works
73:41 - all right so I just need another one
73:45 - so did I call it dynamic
73:48 - dynamic
73:51 - uh so just another one for disable
73:55 - Collider this one is set as false and
73:59 - I'll rename that
74:01 - so on the disable Collider
74:06 - let me get a
74:08 - private collider game object Collider
74:15 - so if I want to disable this Collider
74:20 - if so then on the game object calendar
74:22 - equals get component of type con later
74:26 - so I get this one and then down here on
74:29 - the high if disable game object calendar
74:32 - if so set this one that enabled equals
74:35 - false right because I want to hide it
74:38 - and if not
74:40 - put it on true
74:42 - okay
74:44 - so now on this one
74:47 - well first of all let me modify just the
74:49 - unit
74:52 - okay so on the unit itself on the skin
74:55 - mesh render uh then in for position okay
74:58 - and then on this one on this one let's
75:00 - disable this collider and now I should
75:03 - be able to walk when that one is
75:05 - invisible
75:06 - okay let's see
75:08 - What type of game I make
75:10 - if you're a beginner I would recommend
75:11 - you start with super basic games I
75:14 - actually have a really interesting video
75:15 - that I made a long time ago which is
75:17 - still very much valid nowadays which is
75:19 - this one
75:21 - and basically my advice is start with
75:23 - super simple games so things like Flappy
75:25 - Bird maybe Space Invaders maybe snake
75:28 - start off with those those will really
75:31 - give you quite a bit of starting
75:32 - knowledge and if you can do those then
75:34 - you should be able to do more complex
75:35 - ones okay so basically the issue is that
75:37 - as I click it was clicking on the second
75:39 - floor even as the visuals were hidden
75:42 - but now the visuals should be hiding
75:44 - also the calendar now as I click and
75:46 - there you go it does move all right
75:48 - awesome so now I can move around on the
75:50 - other floor and on this one I can go
75:52 - into the first one and there you go I
75:54 - got units above units below any of
75:56 - everything works with multiple grids and
75:59 - everything works right
76:00 - okay great
76:04 - all right so
76:07 - I've always already messed up but some
76:10 - of this was quite successful
76:12 - tried procedural development sorry I'm
76:15 - not sure what you mean by that
76:16 - I've done a bunch of procedural REI but
76:19 - yeah I don't know
76:21 - um will this be uploaded Yep this will
76:23 - have a VOD so yeah
76:27 - is there a way to build my own
76:28 - programming language in unity
76:30 - uh you can build visual it's actually
76:33 - just a while ago uh
76:38 - uh oh crap what was it called the graph
76:40 - view I think that's the one the unity
76:42 - graph view API so yep you can build your
76:45 - own your own kind of trees using the UI
76:49 - Builder and graph View
76:50 - so yeah if you want to do those kinds of
76:52 - things go ahead and use that one use
76:55 - YouTube live chat API for getting that
76:56 - yep that's exactly it I am using that
76:59 - API I'm doing a basic HTTP request from
77:02 - Unity so I've got the tutorial on the
77:04 - end of that page pretty much just using
77:06 - that in order to contact the YouTube API
77:08 - in order to show it over here uh display
77:11 - RPG course yep that's exactly the goal
77:13 - so right now I'm still in the research
77:15 - phase and I've got to write the entire
77:17 - expansion and in the end Yep this won't
77:20 - come out as a free expansion all right
77:22 - okay
77:24 - okay so that's gonna be it my voice is
77:27 - already messed up I can barely Tonk but
77:29 - some of this was nice this was
77:30 - productive I did manage to do everything
77:32 - that I want to do so I mentioned to do a
77:33 - bunch of research now I just need to
77:35 - record in lectures uh write record edit
77:38 - them and so on so yeah still quite a bit
77:40 - of work but yeah this was productive all
77:42 - right so nice
77:44 - okay so I think that's gonna be it so
77:48 - thank you all so much for joining me let
77:50 - me just set everything up
77:52 - let me just go into that one
77:55 - and all right
77:57 - okay so that's going to be it for me so
77:59 - I hope you have a pleasant day I'm gonna
78:01 - try to play a little bit of Zelda that
78:04 - should be fun so I'm going to try to
78:06 - enjoy that alright so yeah thank you all
78:09 - so much for being here and I'll see you
78:11 - next time alright bye everyone
78:37 - yeah
78:39 - foreign
79:09 - foreign

Cleaned transcript:

foreign foreign foreign hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right all right great all right hey everyone okay let me set this up all right so basically the goal here is lately I've been working on a free expansion to my turnbased strategy course trying to add multilevel support and right now I'm still in the research phase and the one thing that I need to research right now is basically how am I going to handle the pathfinding links for the various Wars as well as how to handle the visibility so that's pretty much my my going for this live stream I need to do this research so I might as well do it live so all right thank you for being here and let's get to it and I'll try to answer as many questions as I can all right okay so first of all just trying it out and yep okay so here is the game pretty basic and basically I implemented can I hide that one okay apparently I hide though uh yeah so I basically just implemented some nice links so this character can go up to the second floor or down to the first one really great all right except the issue right now is that the link is pretty much fixed so that's the first thing that I want to handle I want to be able to but why was that one invisible did I modify that all right I I was testing out the former visibility right that's that's why so let me actually disable this for now I'll work on the visibility afterwards for now I don't want that for now I first just want to handle the pathfinding links so and then when I click I can go up and there you go jumps up and he jumps down okay great uh all right so the first thing that I want is to handle the pathfinding links and for that for some learning to make multiplayer oh that's awesome hey I'm glad you're enjoying it yeah multiplayer used to be so tricky but nowadays thanks to all these awesome tools multiplayer is super easy nowadays well as easy as can be that's it multiplayer is always it's always tricking but thanks to the tools now it is much easier all right watching your videos for I don't know how many years now oh nice thank you thanks for being here for so long but until you're awesome ah thank you hey I'm glad you liked the videos I hope the videos have been very helpful in those so many years all right okay hey and a custom character hey chillies hey nice thanks uh okay right so let me first of all remember how I was handling the pathfinding links so where's my script uh here it is and I had yeah right I made the pathfinding links where I've got the a b and I just made it manually right yep exactly pretty much I got a list of pathfinding links and I just manually created them okay so now I would want uh some way to show this in the editor so let me actually I gotta make it serializable right yeah but let's make first a easy sharp script for the path finding link and call it mono Behavior so that it shows up as a component so that's like ultimate character controller uh personally I normally stick with simpler assets so I prefer assets that do just one tiny thing and do it very well so I'm not necessarily personally I don't really tend to use super complex character controllers that do a billion things but that's just me that really depends some people really like having some premade things with tons and tons of features so if you're like that then by all means go ahead and use it so it pretty much depends on do you like doing things from scrunch or do you need something extremely Advanced because if you do something extremely Advanced that is going to take you several months to build then yeah picking up a readymade tool will definitely helps so yeah basically the answer is depends on you maybe for you it's great or maybe it might be best to build it from scratch so sorry but yeah there's no objective answer uh right so if you're here let me make a serialized film of type pathfinding link for the path training link and I need to mark this as serializable so serialize the bone all right and just with this if there's a screen yeah nice thanks for answering yeah of course uh go to gym yeah of course I love it uh all right so let me try making a simple empty game object for ah crap I press Ctrl P instead of shift p uh for a path finding link and let me add the pathfinding not this one not this one the mono Behavior okay uh oh right is it because it's the it's got grid positions oh right so I need to make the grid position serializable as well all right that's interesting or actually no uh okay that's an interesting question hmm be careful this in dark mode sorry no I can't dark mode burns my eyes if I look at it for more than a second my eyes start to bleed so sorry nope can't do it um right so the issue here is I would like to make a editor tool in order to be able to visualize the grid position links except should I be using great positions I probably shouldn't so you know let me actually modify this so instead of having a puffing link I think I should probably have effective three for the link position a another one for line position B so have this instead of that one and yep now I got two Vector Threes And basically now I'm going to position them okay so this might be best and then I convert those into grid positions and hopefully that should work but okay all right so let's try this and then maybe I will see perhaps the great position works best so anyways just researching so start with this and then we'll see okay so now the thing is I gotta refer to my own tutorial in order to remember how do I add the position handles and apparently I have to use unseen GUI and then use handles.position handle all right so let's try this out but does this have to be in an editor script that's my question private on scene GUI does this one only exist in the editor this is going to throw an error I'm not sure yeah actually editor tools one of those things that haven't really worked with it too much yeah isn't that good considered best solution for a multiplayer I mean what about Photon mirror I've only used netcode so I can only say that one is great depending on the types of games that you want to make but from what I've heard pretty much all of them are excellent so yeah I would say oh why am I playing the game there's no need to play uh yeah pretty much all of those Tunes are excellent nowadays so just pick whatever you want okay so for this one to work I think it does need to so really oh nice awesome hey that's awesome it's actually it's a it's not insanely difficult but it is a very nice challenge yeah working on this expansion has been quite fun uh okay so I think I need an editor and inside I'm going to need the pathfinding mono Behavior editor script and I think like this it should work I just need to make sure using Unity editor and now I need to once again go rewatch my script that's a goal yeah is this course free the turnbased strategy course no that one is paid although I did make a a free tutorial on the first version on the Prototype that I made so if you'd like to see the original prototype that I made before making the entire course you can see that and you can download the project files for that one but yeah the phone stepbystep course that one is a regular paid course uh okay so uh right so I need to watch my own video to remember how do you do the custom editors I don't remember the syntax in the beginning oh is it on the on drug gizmos no I don't think so that's where the jawline that's not what I want nope uh what's the name ah there you go all right so I've got to extend editor and do custom editors all right so let's see syntax that I was looking for so make this of type editor and let's use the not this custom editor of type of and the type is the path finding link mono Behavior all right yep I think it's like this and now I think I should be able to do on scene GUI now this one debug.log if I do a log now I should be able to see the log stripy and Trigger path oh nice that was a fun system yeah it's actually something that is surprisingly easy to do so that's fun yeah I like this and yep there you go got the Unseen okay great uh all right so let me uh okay so I had the Onsen GUI and really the only thing that I needed was yep that's that's the thing the himmel dot position himmel and then I just need to be able to get all right let's see Target okay so let me try to figure out how this works so first of all I grab the Target and the target this is a type object so I'm going to convert this into a path finding link mono Behavior so that's this guy and now with this one I should be able to go is it himmels dot position handle and this one takes a position and a rotation so the position is going to be the pathfinding length Model Behavior Dot uh position a what did I call it all right because uh yeah for editor tools I probably should make these private instead of public just so I can access them from there so over here for the link position a puttering dot identity okay so in theory that should show that one let's see so trying to mess with it from when the multiplayer expansion won't drop uh I don't know I've started researching research I've started writing the beginning parts of it and I've done quite a lot of research so I really just need to handle the length and the visibility then I still gotta write a lot of things so hopefully before the end this month that's pretty much as far as I can say so perhaps in two weeks something like that that's the hope uh okay right so now I do have a second position handle and now I just need to see all right that's the thing I need to do a begin change check this one gives me the new position so effective three this is going to be the new link position a and I need to do what is an editor GUI in order to do a begin change check and then editor GUI dot end change check and this one returns in Boolean if something changes so if something changes let me go into the Pathfinder link Model Behavior the link position a and set it to the new link position a all right I think that's really it do I need to serialize the object I'm not sure specific reason not to use VAR instead of phone class name personally just because I don't like VAR I think I find that VAR tends to obscure the code more than helps so personally I don't really like it I like being extremely explicit but there's nothing inherently wrong with it so if you don't like it then yep by all means go ahead and use it so yeah personally I don't like it but that's just personal preference uh all right okay so this working I can modify this position handle and it shows down so that's great now the one thing is I would like to know how to hide the default pathfinding link position the default game object because that one is pretty useless so I'll have to do some research on how to hide that one but at least this one is working so then I just need to do uh can I do the same thing for the second one so for the pathfinding link position B uh and then I put the B on the new B like this I should be able to change both of them except for that one to move I just need that one to be offset in order to be able to move it and I can move it so now I can put a link over there and put this link roughly over there so I know the Y needs to be on three and then I can position a rough like that so this one is on 6 3 14. 6 something and 12. and there you go okay that's the links all right so that's great only from when yeah all right hi thanks for being here all right instead of calling handle why not use an interface I'm not sure what you mean by that what interface does the editor use I'm not sure can convert the URL to MP3 but doesn't seem to work in YouTube links uh I have no idea I mean YouTube links when you access YouTube link it doesn't actually give you a video so you have to somehow seek through the video in order to download on the bytes yeah I don't know for for dealing with HTTP requests I've only done things where I grabbed the entire thing right away so things that have to do with streaming yeah for that sorry I have no idea how down would be handled that is quite tricky uh okay right so okay so that's pretty much all that I need in order to get the editor working hey Desmond says hi hi Desmond uh all right so now that I have this working the next question is how do I put the pathfinding links and I think perhaps a good way is when we go into oh let me actually make a nice function so a public going to return a pathfinding link no not the editor it's not the one that I want the amount of behavior so this one doesn't need the answer going so this one at finding link get pathfinding link and this one going to return going to create a new Pathfinder link and the grid position a level Grid dot instance dot get the grid position on the link position a so I do this same thing for the grid position B and yep that's pretty much it so this Returns the Pathfinder link must stream slightly cool yeah I'm definitely trying to do them a bit more whenever I have to do some research I might as well do it live and try to answer some questions do some things so it's always a bit more fun rather than working alone all the time it's a bit of a different hey greetings from India nice there's links you're making for stairs and such yep these links can be whatever you want so it can be stairs and letters something like that pretty much just connects a position on a grid position on Circle 4 to another position then visually that can be whatever you want to be yeah a good way to deal with an after image what do you mean by after image so I'm only thinking about Dragon Ball where you got like and after image where they move really quickly so that would be more of a visual effect so something using the VFX ref so I'm not sure what you mean by that an after image with a permanent mesh I guess maybe you could duplicate a mesh is that what you mean definitely get a mesh and make it kind of like a transparent like the character Trails behind when moving fast yeah I guess that would be one way to do it as the character is moving around you pretty much just copy the mesh you instantiate a new mesh using that mesh data I assume you're working with a skin mesh render and I believe you can work with the with the skin measure and the vertices so yeah I guess that would be it make a simple full timer so every x amount of seconds it just copies the mesh and just creates that mesh on that position as the as the skin mesh really continues going so pretty much just instantiate the brand new fix mesh yeah that would be a funny fact that sounds interesting um uh okay what was I doing uh right so I've got the editor okay so I've got the pathfinding link Model Behavior and basically I just need to let me go into the pathfinding and I think the best way is Let's Make a transform and call it pathfinding link container something like this so then I'm going to go pathfinding link list pathfinding light not the container pathfinding link list annual list okay then for each for each transform pathfinding link transform in the pathfliner link container I cycle through all the children then the pathfinding link transform in order to get the component or try and get components that's probably for the best out of path finding link mono Behavior so out on the final link Model Behavior so I try to do a trigger component on that then I take the pathfinding link mono behavior and I get the pathfinding link and go into the pathfinding link list in order to add this new one and that way I no longer need anything like that all right great okay so this should actually be working very well already now I can easily create all kinds of links okay you keep yourself up to date with new ENT features Yeah by trying I try to read their blog keep up to date with all the news watch various Unity YouTube channels do all kinds of things so yeah I try to keep up to date and of course I got uh contact with the UNT team itself so every time they do something new a lot of times they send me updates directly so yep I try to keep up to date as much as possible mentioning a project with 100 devs who is trying to do that that is definitely tricky yeah that is a whole nother skill set how do you manage a massive team with tons of people doing all kinds of things that is definitely one skill set that I do not have so yeah if you're trying to do that best of luck uh okay so let's make one link there and another one in there so let's put this one on position one and let me make it quite a bit smaller so on the size of four okay let's put a link there and another one there so for that all right I need to make an empty game object for the pathfind thing ah crap I can't write link container let's reset this and now inside I put on the pathway link so I got this one and I'm going to have another one in there and in there so on zero and zero okay so now I've got the super funny links so the character should be able to jump right through here or through here and everything should work okay so my team why is burning while watching oh sorry but the same thing happened to me with dark mode dark mode really burns my eye so that is why I cannot use it uh and obviously as usual I forgot to drag a reference that always happens so let me just drag the container reference and try it out again all right see what GDC conferences yeah so there were I watched a bunch of the unity ones but yeah there are I actually do have a GDC pass with access to the GDC volt so yeah I I've been trying to find the time but hopefully when I do find Tom I can watch some of those awesome talks and look at that it did work right so some of you might not know the importance of what just happened but let me tell you it is quite amazing yeah so essentially I've managed to create pathfinding links let me actually add because I got I keep testing this one with uh where did I add the the things I don't even know yeah the action points let me put it on 10 just so I don't have to test quite a lot all right because yeah this is actually quite amazing so I can take this character and I can jump up to the second floor I can go through here and I can jump down or jump up through this one so yep I've got a nice connection between both of them let's create some more links just to verify that yep everything is indeed working perfectly so where's the pivot on this one let me go down and say yep I want to make another link on that one so put this one on 10 let me duplicate this wall put another one on this 25 and stretch it out a little bit all right so let me just make another pathfinding link and this one I'm gonna fall in there and go up roughly around there so let me put the position so this one's on 8 and 25. oh did I catch it in the middle or no maybe not yeah I think it's 24 yeah I think this one might be a little bit too big it's okay uh 24 and on 10. so on this one let me just yeah this one apparently should be a tiny bit smaller is it 9.5 I don't know I guess we shouldn't see it let's test all right give us a link a little graphic at least yeah sure I mean I'm only working on the on the uh functionality of it right now hey and look at that it does work so I can go and now I can jump down through that one and yeah there you go so basically just working on getting the functionality working and yep then obviously you would put some kind of ladder in here instead of the instead of the animation being just a falling down animation you'd have a proper leather climb animation and so on but yep all the logic is indeed working all right great next version of your great tutorial on your site seems like it's missing a step around when you add the TMP debug prefab uh it's been a while since I wrote that so yeah okay sure thanks for the tip on I'll keep that in mind let me write a note here all right I'll keep that in mind thanks okay how'd you make it so each person is watching the video has their character on screen well that's a simple connection with the YouTube API I've got a bunch of tutorials related to that so on this page it's the page where you can customize your character but on the bottom over here I also got links to various tutorials that I made so a tutorials for how I made this transparent DNT window another one for how I made the mesh based animations then how I made an HTTP request from Unity so that's how I'm contacting the YouTube API in order to get the messages and finally these characters these are the ones that I use in my game Battle Royal Tycoon so that's pretty much how I made that okay all right so here I created the links and all of them work so adding new links to this level is super easy just need to add them over here and everything works perfectly all right great you're awesome hey you too nice um right so let me think what else was I trying to do so I got the links right now okay right so another thing that I want is just to make sure that everything does work let me make yet another four so let me duplicate the floor put it up on 6.001 just so there's no is that fighting I'll even put it something like this so on 3 31 about 31 32. uh is that it always a bit confused I don't remember when I made the what is the origin right it needs to be on an odd number so yeah this one's actually on 31 I think 31.5 either way just a visual I'll worry about that in a bit so like this okay so pretty much got a second floor there let me just add some more walls so put them on nine enough six all right another one over there so minus minus 1.5 yep something like this and definitely get this one put it on six all right so I got a nice third floor and let's also put a wall just so it makes a bit more sense as to how the character is jumping so perhaps on 25 something like that okay let's put it like this just playing around the visuals a little bit all right okay great I think going on dots and ECS uh I think the plan is selling to hit 1.0 by the time that that the LTS version comes out which should be sometime soon I hope they said a few weeks in in um GDC which was quite a while ago so yeah I'm guessing the LTS version should be around anytime now and when it happens yep I think dots 1.0 should be coming out so yep as far as I know everything that is on the plan so it's only works as far as I know it's not a Bend or anything like that all right so so I don't know I need to do is go into my level Grid and instead of being two floors let's put and say this more or less threefourths and for the link let me make another link and this one lets it connect from there and go up go up on two four six I think let me go and just make sure yep so on 4 24 4 26. all right so got another link so I should be able to go up there so let's see all right okay so let me pick this one up and I can jump onto this link that's great and if there you go I can go there and I can go into this link and I can go into the third form all right that's pretty awesome all right yeah this has been a a fun thing to work on being able to add multiple fours really increase the amount of level complexity that you can build so that is really nice no kitchen chaos mobile controls come uh the answer is whenever I have time that's that's the answer to so many of my projects yep it's definitely on my list so I don't know when but hopefully soon all right okay so the multifloors did work all right that's great now the next thing that I want to research is how am I going to handle the visibility that is tricky so if you don't have the wall there uh without the wall is just a vision so if I hide this one the link is still there so all that matters is that there's a pathfinding link between these two positions so that's pretty much the only thing that matters so while we're in a wall that's just a visual so you could add a proper uh leather over here you could add a proper leather animation so pretty much just the main thing that I'm working on is just making sure that the logic works and yep then it's up to you up to anyone who wants to implement any kind of visuals on top so it can be whatever you want can be a basic jump animation that's that's what I'm using here just because I don't know how to make animations so yeah that is why over here I just made a super basic animation just jumping up falling down but this animation can be whatever you want so yep so when it comes to climbing Leathers jumping falling down that's really just a visual so it's very easy to add the visuals on top of the logic attention I'm logic so much Ah that's awesome I'm glad the videos have been helpful to you give them jet packs yep you can definitely you could definitely apply some jetpack logic some flying logic pretty much all of that is possible yeah show what it looks like without the wall yeah the wall doesn't doesn't matter so if I disable this one the one object is no longer there but yep it can still go because the link is there so the link is commonly separate from the wall so it has nothing to do with any visuals so I can go and it doesn't have any more action points ah crap now they're going to shoot me oh boy they're gonna take 10 10 steps all right but yeah the wall is just visual so yeah uh okay right so the other thing that I want to research is how am I going to handle the visibility because the issue is there's a floor down here except when I'm up here it's really hard to work with this one so I got to figure out some way of hiding these visuals as the camera Zooms in and zooms out so let's see that all right not a cartoon monkey nope I'm a regular human just like you uh okay right so for that one I was thinking about some kind of floor visibility script that says what floor it is and then in order to either show or hide this one so probably void show in order to make these basic Shore height functions I'm going to work with the game object renders so one just shows one just hides yeah right just the renderer right yeah so yeah the thing that I need to remember is how was I handling the the camera that was tricking one of the few YouTubers you can understand without subtitles so really wow that's awesome sometimes I'm a bit selfconscious about my weird accent but hey if you can understand that's awesome I'm glad you I'm glad you can understand it yeah uh right curiosity do you plan to do tutorial on how to make Rhythm games one day that's a very Niche genre so yeah I don't know about that I definitely enjoy playing them I used to enjoy what was it called Step Mania that was it right yeah that was a really awesome game I was really addicted to that for quite a while so yeah it was that many yeah really awesome so yeah I was really addicted to this playing just with my fingers instead of with the feet but yeah this was really awesome so yeah Rhythm games they are fun but yeah covering them in the tutorial I'm not sure that's a a bit way too Niche that's the thing about YouTube whenever I dedicate some time to a video and the videos always say quite a lot of time several hours so if I'm going to make something I need to I need to choose things that might do well although sometimes I can definitely afford to do some videos that doesn't don't get that many views just for fun but yeah who knows maybe one day I'll uncover that genre I mean if I had infinite time I would love to cover pretty much every genre in existence but yeah suddenly I don't have a time machine so yeah I wish that were possible but not really uh right 2D uh the issue yeah the issue is that unity's nav mesh component that is really made just for 3D so yeah if you're working on 2D nav meshes then really my advice to you is to use the astar path finding finding so that's my advice pretty much is get the astar pathfinding asset which actually only they do have the astar pathfinding project they actually do have a free version that's pretty much how I started when I was first of reverse Bay yeah when I was first working on my first steam game Survivor Squad and obviously I had no money so when I started I was actually using the free version and I only upgraded to the pro version just when I had pretty much the game commonly done so yeah if you're working in 2D pathfinding I would highly encourage you to look into either this one or some other pathfinding solution because yeah as far as I know unity's navmesh really is not built for pathfinding I think they do have uh I think there are some extras that make it support 2D but yeah for the most part yeah I would recommend something like this instead of trying to get down to work uh uh okay so for shooting and hiding basically I just need to remember how was I handling the camera because I don't remember that how did I handle the camera was the camera controller perhaps uh right because this one has the zoom the zoom Target follow offset yep that's what I'm using right yep okay right so I need to access the camera so let me make a public static camera controller for the instance where they get any private set and let's make your prize wide awake and on the way except the instance of this and now I'm going to need a function uh uh float let's say get camera height and I'm going to return the target file offset.y okay so this and now on this one let me go into the camera controller access the instance in order to get the camera height so let's see float for the camera height and now basically on this one I need to Define how am I going to show it but it can't be based just on the floor height yeah because the camera is under no if it is hmm uh because I got what do I do do I do well let me just do a debug download just to see what the camera height doesn't like and then see about other engines compared to Unity I think nowadays as developers we are really spawned for choice because pretty much every single engine is excellent so yeah personally I love unity I keep using Unity because it's an excellent engine can do anything that I want to do but thankfully nowadays pretty much all the engines are great so pretty much just pick one and start learning it okay why is this not updating or is it zoomed up okay it's it was zoomed in uh right so essentially uh yeah do I do it plus one so when it's on four I want to hide these visuals is that what I'm going to do uh uh all right okay so let's define a float for the show height and basically I'm going to show if the camera height it is bigger than what's going to level Grid and get the four Heights plus some offsets is that what I do yeah I think yeah float for the uh for height offset something like this so won't show height if that one is above that one so if you'll hide then I'm going to show and if not then I'm going to hide okay all right so let's try it out and see if this works position on a 3D pathfinding solution oh that's what do you mean by 3D do you mean like grids like voxel grids or 3D terrain because rain is essentially flat the question is do you have positions above other or other positions because terrain we're just going up then essentially you just need a a flat pathfinding solution so that one pretty much anything works I mean either way I would always recommend the Acer pathwaying project I was telling you about that a while ago so either way that's the main one that I would recommend for pathfinding for super simple things yeah sure I would use uh unity's builtin navmesh but for anything more complex for pathfinding that's pretty much what I would do Rhythm games are more than just DDR equipment yeah I yeah beat saber is definitely some that I love I spend a lot of time so yeah it's another one those things where if I had a time machine I would love to be able to have infinite time in order to spend some time researching VR and yep I'd love to make some kind of beat saber clone to really see how it works so yeah that's another one of those things that is permanently on my todo list and hopefully one day I should I will hopefully be able to get it someday maybe uh okay so if I go in if there go at some point that one disappears all right okay so I think yeah pretty much just play around the offset but at least the logic is right there so now the question is do I apply this yeah I think that's kind of the issues that I have to manually apply this component to every single object yeah that's the that's the only downside of this I think now that I need to manually add this to every single one so I paste component as new so all of these are on the first floor this one is also on the first floor and now this one up here this one is going to be on the second floor now let me copy this component and on this one this one in this one these are also on the second floor right oh did I add to this one already no that one you don't have a two let me remove this one that one is on two that one is also on two why did I add to this one oh then I add to the base one okay that I don't work oh right because I split down I think anyways all right so yeah the components are a bit on it's a bit manual but let's see if this works all right so time to learn how to juggle with a pen well I learned that like 15 years ago that is why I pretty much just know two tricks but yeah that's not something that I've learned recently integrate manager that holds on four references yep definitely right now I'm just focused on trying to get it working and then I'll worry about making it performing but yep so far so here is the third floor and as I zoom in and all right because this one's on the second floor but is that one okay that one should be hiding but it's not hiding let me put the scene view side by side or to be able to see what is happening yeah why is that one not yeah they all vanish at once why did I not put it on too I did put oh never mind I didn't multiply it right so the four height times the what did I quality for and pause the offset okay that is why the second one wasn't working all right tried using UI token I've done some research on it and it does seem uh it was already very stable very much production ready when I first saw it when I first saw when I last saw it which was several months ago so yeah by now I would say that one is probably very close to production ready so yeah I won't that's another one of those things as soon as I have the time yep I definitely want to make a tutorial in order to figure out how it actually works okay so I think I should increase the think about a little bit otherwise it's a bit too hard but yeah only four height offset let's put it on 2f and I just need to on the camera controller also make it zoom out by a little bit more so instead of tovaf let's put it 15f okay programming is so interesting yes it is that's why I love it it's a neverending challenge you can do anything you can build anything as long as you have the skills for it anything goes that is really awesome had a chance to play Tears against them yet nope I did go ahead and pick it up actually got it here got a nice where's my camera yeah nice so yeah when to pick up the copy earlier this morning but yeah still trying to get a bunch of work done so that I can then go play a little bit so yeah hopefully in a little bit after this live stream yep that's the plan try to do it see what it does I really love playing breath of wild so yeah this year was my my switch was essentially dead because I hadn't uh I mean the last time I used it was when was it yeah Pokemon let's go Pikachu was that the one which wasn't like three years ago yeah that was the last time that I used my switch so yeah pretty much just played breath one Mario and that Pokemon game yeah so so yeah because that my switch was essentially dead I was trying to get it alive while ago and yep in a little bit I want to go play uh right so yep the visibility isn't it working so I can see everything happening on the third floor I can zoom in in order to see everything happening on this one and zoom down and I see everything happening on this one all right that's pretty great you see making an RPG game is worth it nowadays sure I mean RPG means a ton of things so yeah it really depends on what you mean by that but in general yep RPG can definitely still be I mean depends on your target platform it really depends on what you mean but yeah there are plenty of very successful RPGs if you ask about Platformers then at that point I would say probably not because that's really difficult but RPGs RPGs usually kind of like a subgenre or like a secondary genre so yeah you can apply RPG mechanics to tons of other genres so yeah video on how you quickly navigate around visual script yeah or not visual script visual studio uh yeah I thought about making a video on the most used shortcuts but yeah for the most part uh actually most things aren't really Visual Studio like just move instead of moving the cursor one one character at a time you press Ctrl and it goes by the entire word so this alone is super useful so that and shift that is really useful for selecting a bunch of things then just knowing you how to select and and so on then I've got a an extension which actually helps me move the cursor up and down by about five lines so this is really good for quickly moving up or quick one moving down then what else being able to have control Dash in order to open up something else so path finding and there you go I can open up the pathfinding script then what else control tab in order to swap between them uh you can do control RR in order to rename things so yeah I definitely would like to do a video on a bunch of those shortcuts because yeah learning how to use your IDE properly that definitely helps you in your uh and becoming a lot more efficient so yeah that's definitely something quite uh quite useful to know all right uh this become an update for turnbased strategy course yep that's exactly it so I'm pretty much just researching in order to be able to do the next free course expansion so yep the engine is good for selfexpression system create for independent developers yeah I mean it's amazing that you can do pretty much anything with unity and with any game engine that is actually quite amazing do you have any thoughts on Visual Studio versus jetbrains uh I don't know I don't have any I've heard great things about chat brings writer but personally I haven't tried it because simply because I mean uh Visual Studio already does everything that I want to do so that is why I pretty much have no reason to try to switch because I mean pretty much is I just use the IDE mostly just for writing code I don't use any special features or abilities or something like that so yeah for the most part I've only used Visual Studio but I have heard great things from writer so if you don't like it then yep go ahead and use it okay dude those guys walking on the motor party screen that's just interaction with the YouTube API so if you go on to this page down here at the bottom I've got the various tutorials where I cover the various things so it's a transparent TNT window the characters are some mesh based animation and they're just interacting with YouTube API with an HTTP request that's pretty much it uh all right so honestly these two tasks were pretty much the only things that I want to do for this live stream so I guess I could see yeah I guess I could see okay so what is the best way for me to handle this see that's actually an interesting question with regards to uh performance is this a concern or not how long actually let's oh why don't I try finding out let's open up the analysis the profiler and let me put on the Deep profile to make it so instead of making them invisible you just lower that opacity uh for that basically you would need to work with the with the material and actually I was thinking of not doing that because it's a bit too complicated but honestly it might not be as complicated and let me just see if I can easily access yeah that's the issue because this one doesn't take that one into account yeah that's a problem basically the way you do it would be by modifying the alpha but yeah this Shader that that I use over here this Shader does not support changing the alpha so that is kind of the issue basically the way you do it you wouldn't lure the alpha in order to make it a lot more transparent but yeah if this one does not support the iPhone because yeah it doesn't so suddenly yeah that makes it quite a bit more tricky yeah oh it's super chat name thank you thanks so much thermal vibration or using a tune sound Shader with the latest couple with the latest couple LTS after a bigger project I keep getting GPU Timeout on a 40 series GPU timeout what do you mean by that when doing uh light map baking is that it I mean that's going to depend on how big is your world but yeah yeah I'm using the the uh there's the asset store oh actually I got it or no because I didn't yeah I didn't make a thing on it but yeah I'm using quimly or squiggly quickly so yep that's the asset then I was using pregrade stylized Shader so if you want to make things nice and size then this Shader is pretty great has tons of options so yeah and if you're having issues with yeah GPU timeout swap chain yeah I'm pretty sure I've seen that error that's annoying uh but yeah if the issues with like baking then the answer is start off on the lowest settings possible and then slowly increase them pretty much otherwise I'm not sure what you mean by GPU timeout can you please explain the gaps between unity and real I mean those are different engines gaps I don't know I don't know enough about unreal to know what it lacks I know that Unity is a bit behind on the super highend things CNT is currently working on some pretty amazing the uh what what did I call the Adaptive Pro volumes so they're working on a not crap they're working on something to essentially compete with Lumen and this one does seem quite impressive so yeah that's that would be one gap which is how unreal already has Lumen whereas Unity is only beginning to work on it but at least the things that they are working it does seem quite impressive there was a gift with everything working in action right here on this one you can play around yeah you can do a bunch of things so yeah this one is Stone development but it looks really great yeah I can't wait for this signal to come out to to the um to urp right now it's already available on the egrp but for me I use Erp for the most part so that is why oh that's super chat thank you uh with flat kid heavy GPU swap chain air with uplines okay I'm not sure I've never seen that error I mean it will have some workload depending on how many objects how many outlines you're adding but yeah with the flat kit yeah I haven't used that one but as far as I know that one is supposed to also be pretty good isn't it yeah it's this one yeah I haven't used this one I've only used quimly and pixelizer and a bunch of others so I haven't used this one specifically but I would assume they have some optimizations in order to make it work on just uh on just one dracon so yeah I'm not sure I've never used it so yeah I don't know if it has any issues with heavy work mode Unity repent and crashes yeah that's on because this one has tons of positive reviews so I don't know maybe try contacting the developer I don't know something like that um Okay so all right so I was thinking so should I upgrade this or not because I like the all right that's what I was doing I forgot to get a bit distracted for a while but yeah essentially I wanted to open up the analysis the profiler in order to enable the profile let's not record and let's head on play hey good morning uh uh let's just start playing all right let me select this one and let's now hit on record yeah right now they shouldn't oh crap something went wrong or did I pause oh I just like it once all right so I pick one and uh that's the thing does this have yeah it does have a search okay good so I was trying to see okay how am I going to find my script just in case this one isn't too intense because right away I'm looking at times in milliseconds right away it does not seem to be intense at all but let's see so the four visibility yeah it is literally taking 0.0 so yeah so this kind of I guess this is a good example as to when should you worry about updating something and when you shouldn't because basically this script this script that I wrote here this one is technically it's technically not very performant because running this script on every update on every single object that has one of those components attached so supposedly this isn't super performant but at the same time as you can see it is literally taking 0.00 milliseconds so whilst technically this isn't very performant well secondly you could definitely optimize this as you can see if it is on 0.0 then probably there's no reason why you should waste time optimizing so yeah uh all right so let me actually open up something else since this one was actually easier than I thought let me actually go into the ugc project in order to see a bunch of things want to learn in real engine can I suggest some coursework no sorry I only know about Unity so yeah this is the wrong channel to ask about in real stuff uh right but how would you optimize it I mean you would basically have just one manager component where it would cycle through all of them and pretty much you would only grab the camera height once it would only do the calculations for the floor height ones you would only call the show if it was actually hidden it would only come to hide if it was shown so yeah there are plenty plenty of ways to pretty much optimize this to make sure that all of these things don't run tons and tons of times and only run as many times as needed so yeah tons of things you could do to really improve upon this so much oh crap let's uh open up the project on the other one send one video on how to connect Dynamic utilities like the conveyor belts Dynamic utility I mean the issue with that is that it's a very specific thing meaning that it's very specific to a specific game so making something generic about how to connect a power system to a conveyor belt system yeah that's kind of the issue that's always that's one of the problems with making tutorials is how do I make it appealing to not just one type of person but many people how do I make it useful to several people so yeah that's a that's the tricky part but yeah for the most part it's really you just got a list of items and you somehow interact with that list by doing something like having power consumers and Power emitters something like that so yeah that's a it's a fun system to make I definitely enjoyed making it but yeah making a tutorial on that is quite a bit tricky to manage to get the modding stuff working yep I didn't uh the main thing that was missing was just the how do I unload the the things showing how to build connections between the nodes I mean for the most part that is really just a list of no day node B each node has a position and then visually you draw a list so you draw a line between them so the visual part or the in logic part is around just a list and the visual part can be whatever you want so yeah it's a trying to figure out a nice way to present that in a tutorial that is a bit of the tricky part um yeah sure so I was working on the on the modding and it did work quite well so basically end up the main issue was with the with the meshes and now I don't remember how I was doing it right uh uh yeah because I don't like this yeah so I got the save and then I got the load and it does actually work right yeah I come into this one out hey good morning um Yeah so basically the way that I made work was by using I try to look into how it was possible to unload an uh obj at runtime and the only way that I could find was using a free the obj Importer what was it called yeah I think it was this one it was right uh yeah right it was this one so yeah apparently Unity does not have a builtin way of working but apparently with that asset I can essentially take a path for some kind of mesh obj data and I can take down I can load it import it convert it into a mesh then on that mesh I can grab the mesh status so the versus triangles and UVS and then with that mesh data I can convert that into Json then that Json I convert them to bytes so obviously this is not the most uh optimized way of doing it but it does work convert that into a bytes and save the whole thing so basically on my demo here so let me actually stop this one or this one and on this one it actually did work hey once again thanks for the super chant sorry I couldn't be more helpful but yeah try to contact the dev that is probably the best thing you can do um right so here if I go what about materials and shaders and stuff uh basically for this type of mudding I'm just using textures so there you go open up and here I have a nice little uh what was it a battery right yeah so I added this battery component and it worked perfectly basically just got the battery and then I've got the texture and I pretty much just take both those and I convert those into this my mod file or not this one this one byte save so this is pretty much the mod file so just 1.7 megabytes which contains this contains the recipe that's on and so on so yeah this actually worked out pretty well so the ugc uh research did go quite well uh yep it does simplify quite a bit so this is actually quite good all right so yeah the ugc video hopefully that should be out soon I still need to talk with the ugc ugc team in order to figure out if it does work and yeah for the turn based strategy This research was actually quite helpful so I did manage to do that now I just need to write some notes in order to start writing the lectures for the course and then the free update should be out sometime before the end of this month but yeah this was quite fun hey thanks for the Super Chat blender to UNT portal is great experimental with this experiment there's a package blender to Unity what is the blender TNT portal blender to Unity portal is that a thing or are you just saying about about importing things Oh you mean it exports directly from blender into Unity right but for modding basically what I need is I need a a file and you have an okay so yeah yeah basically for modding I just need a separate file just to have the mesh data that I need to dynamically be able to unload that file in order to create the mod so that other people can load that so yeah that's the tricky part is making it work without having blender or any kind of 3D modeling in the mix all right can we see your dog when you're done working I mean they're asleep so I don't think so but yeah I gotta I gotta figure out a way to have multiple cameras and yeah then I could point one at them and that would be a fun second live stream camera uh all right so yeah so over here the multiform wars expansion it is working quite well even though yeah the uh yeah in terms of performance adding a third level really does make it quite a bit slower yeah that's kind of the issue so perhaps it won't be a third expansion perhaps working on some performance improvements because yeah on this one yeah you can see a little a little sluggish whenever the character moves a different grid position it definitely slows down by quite a bit and that's just basically because over here look at all these game objects of the grid system visual yeah this really should be a mesh so yeah definitely need to figure out how to optimize that quite a bit but yeah the logic for having multiple fours isn't it working so here I have a third form I can even zoom in zoom out oh right I need to sort that out oh that's actually a good question I guess so I put them on the characters themselves because I can take this character and I can go all the way over there right so I can move oh on the floor I also need to okay all right so okay trying to think how do I handle this because then I use a mesh render let me actually so I thought this one was yeah I guess right I need the renderer so I think this one is actually already should already be working so if I take the unit inside I take the character not the character but the uh actual skin mesh render and over here I add the other one so what did I add what did I called I don't remember the name D4 visibility so ah crap where's the the floor visibility okay let me just update this just to make another one so bull Dynamic for position all right new super chant oh hey thanks again it's called Mish sync Works vice versa in real time so that's for what let's say blender mesh sink oh it's a yinty thing wow that looks interesting synchronizing meshes and models wait so you can edit it inside Unity oh I guess it goes both ways is that the thing create a server and connects to it okay that seems interesting okay yeah I have no I have no experience with or I don't have much experience with blender 3D modeling those kinds of things so yeah I can't tell exactly what is impressive but yep it doesn't look great to be able to essentially animate and be able to see all the key points all of them positioned perfectly yeah that does sound quite interesting nice okay KD 3 might be handy here yep in order to handle that visibility but actually the issue is not quite so much with finding the things to show and hide the issue is basically that right now on the grid positions on the floor all of them are instantiated so that is why that is the thing that takes the most amount of time is that it actually has like a thousand individual game objects of them being shown hidden and so on it's personal to somehow open the file manager in unity and get it to work in the exportable uh maybe you can work with the uh with the windows API maybe if you work with that directly it might be able to work but yeah I'm not entirely sure usually for a file manager inside your game you really have to build it yourself so you have to use the regular csharp things in order to grab the folders grab the files and show them somewhere in the game but technically using the the windows API might work so that's pretty much the same thing as how I create the characters down here so the transparency window overlay this one works by interacting directly with the windows API so yeah yes that's what it where I would try to see how that works so you've turned the link transforms into Vector 3 points on a singling the issue isn't the link transforms it's with the the line Transformers they're not causing any issues the issue with the Slowdown is run just the the visuals because all of these visuals they are all individual game objects so as I select all of these these are all individual game objects and that is obviously very costly to have thousands of these so as I got three forwards I essentially got can I enable them yeah I can show them out once but yeah pretty much all these positions up here let me see where's this one yeah there you go that position is in there in there and so on look at all of these tons and tons of them so this one for example which is on a place where it doesn't even exist but all right let's see red white it's the mesh render yeah look at this one that one isn't even a position that has reachable but the way that it works right now it's not even testing for anything so one quick optimization would be to only create the visuals on external walkable positions so that would work but the main thing is really just convert all these Visions onto a tile map so it's kind of what I did when I made the town map quite a long time ago uh Yep this one the custom tile map so on this one pretty much all of these positions make up just a single mesh so that's pretty much how we do it if I wanted to improve the performance on this one pretty much just convert them all into a single mesh and that would be quite a lot more performance and to only create them when the character is selected Maybe sure if you use the object pulling then instantiating just these ones that could work but uh yeah uh anyway so let me just fix this my voice is already messed up so I'm gonna go in a bit let me just quickly try to get this to work so that when I have a character and I go up there and over here as I zoom it hides the walls but it does not hide that player so I want to hide that player so over here can we do Dynamic pathfinding is in real time I don't know what you mean by that because pathfinding is always in real time so I'm not internally sure what you mean by that do you mean modifying the pathfinding because that's kind of what I'm this game already has that so of these all of these positions these are unwalkable because there's something on it without baking navmesh well then you so you're talking about actually modifying the padlock for example over here this position is not walkable but if I throw grenade over there that one is destroyed and yep no this position is now wonkable so that's just updating the actual word position so that depends on what Pathfinder you're using if you're using navmesh then if you have to rebake the position wherever things change and if you're using something like I'm using here so a grid pathfinding system that that depends on how you handle the Grid in this case it is really as simple as the um path node is that what I called it the path node just swapping his Wonka bone from fonsi 2 and yep there you go it becomes walkable alright so let me just quickly sort this out so on the floor visibility I've got the dynamic 4 position so if this one is true if so then let's go into four level Grid instance dot get floor I think just like this it should work that this transformed that position So based on like this if that one is on that one you have video on this grid navigation system yep I mean I have a step by step ah stepbystep thing in the phone course but if you want just the pathfinding then yep I've covered the Asar pathway algorithm and how it works it's a very fascinating algorithm takes a while to click but yeah then it's really powerful Yep this is using a star yep uh right so let's see if this modification changes once again thanks so so much for the super channel for the nice tool hint that was nice all right so jump into that one and as I go and no oh right because wait three no because he is hiding but he only hides oh wait no that makes no sense why is this one uh I guess depends on the transformed opposition yeah what position does this one have that's the question okay let me try this out or maybe I just didn't change it yeah probably just yeah of course I just forgot to tell the bullion that would do it all right so let me go up there and as I zoom in if they go it hides the walls and also the player now I just need to apply it over there to that one but yep that's pretty much it and yeah I guess I also need a Tylenol for because right now I would not be able to click underneath because the clicks would be blocked right so if I go there now I try to walk on that lower floor and right now if I zoom in I can't see it but I cannot click on it because I'm actually clicking on top of that so I need to go underneath and now it works all right so I just need another one so did I call it dynamic dynamic uh so just another one for disable Collider this one is set as false and I'll rename that so on the disable Collider let me get a private collider game object Collider so if I want to disable this Collider if so then on the game object calendar equals get component of type con later so I get this one and then down here on the high if disable game object calendar if so set this one that enabled equals false right because I want to hide it and if not put it on true okay so now on this one well first of all let me modify just the unit okay so on the unit itself on the skin mesh render uh then in for position okay and then on this one on this one let's disable this collider and now I should be able to walk when that one is invisible okay let's see What type of game I make if you're a beginner I would recommend you start with super basic games I actually have a really interesting video that I made a long time ago which is still very much valid nowadays which is this one and basically my advice is start with super simple games so things like Flappy Bird maybe Space Invaders maybe snake start off with those those will really give you quite a bit of starting knowledge and if you can do those then you should be able to do more complex ones okay so basically the issue is that as I click it was clicking on the second floor even as the visuals were hidden but now the visuals should be hiding also the calendar now as I click and there you go it does move all right awesome so now I can move around on the other floor and on this one I can go into the first one and there you go I got units above units below any of everything works with multiple grids and everything works right okay great all right so I've always already messed up but some of this was quite successful tried procedural development sorry I'm not sure what you mean by that I've done a bunch of procedural REI but yeah I don't know um will this be uploaded Yep this will have a VOD so yeah is there a way to build my own programming language in unity uh you can build visual it's actually just a while ago uh uh oh crap what was it called the graph view I think that's the one the unity graph view API so yep you can build your own your own kind of trees using the UI Builder and graph View so yeah if you want to do those kinds of things go ahead and use that one use YouTube live chat API for getting that yep that's exactly it I am using that API I'm doing a basic HTTP request from Unity so I've got the tutorial on the end of that page pretty much just using that in order to contact the YouTube API in order to show it over here uh display RPG course yep that's exactly the goal so right now I'm still in the research phase and I've got to write the entire expansion and in the end Yep this won't come out as a free expansion all right okay okay so that's gonna be it my voice is already messed up I can barely Tonk but some of this was nice this was productive I did manage to do everything that I want to do so I mentioned to do a bunch of research now I just need to record in lectures uh write record edit them and so on so yeah still quite a bit of work but yeah this was productive all right so nice okay so I think that's gonna be it so thank you all so much for joining me let me just set everything up let me just go into that one and all right okay so that's going to be it for me so I hope you have a pleasant day I'm gonna try to play a little bit of Zelda that should be fun so I'm going to try to enjoy that alright so yeah thank you all so much for being here and I'll see you next time alright bye everyone yeah foreign foreign foreign
