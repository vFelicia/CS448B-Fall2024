00:00 - hey everyone so i've been working like
00:02 - crazy for a while now and i'm almost
00:04 - done with the complete visual scripting
00:05 - course
00:06 - this course is focused on making
00:07 - complete games without writing a single
00:09 - line of code
00:10 - i'm nearing the final stages and i'm
00:12 - really happy with the current result
00:13 - i've managed to implement tons of
00:15 - features both simple and complex and so
00:17 - far i still haven't yet reached the
00:19 - limits of visual scripting at all
00:21 - it really is an insanely powerful tool
00:23 - and definitely capable of making games
00:24 - only with visual scripting and also
00:26 - another side benefit
00:28 - is as you go along and learn to use
00:29 - visual scripting you also start to
00:31 - understand programming concepts
00:32 - so visual scripting is also a great
00:34 - stepping stone for starting to learn
00:36 - programming
00:37 - since you will be exposing yourself to
00:38 - logic and programming concepts while
00:40 - working on it
00:41 - i specifically designed this course to
00:42 - include making several games from
00:44 - scratch so you can learn to apply visual
00:46 - scripting to any genre you can think of
00:48 - so the first game is a platformer it
00:50 - starts off simple just handling player
00:52 - movement jumping collisions and so on
00:54 - all without writing a single line of
00:56 - code then over time more elements are
00:58 - added then the game really starts to
00:59 - take shape
01:00 - so by the end there's moving platforms
01:02 - multiple levels hazards coins
01:04 - lava and so on the second game is an
01:07 - action rpg
01:08 - this one is a pre-complete game with
01:10 - tons of features so it's got multiple
01:12 - weapons multiple enemies and hazards
01:14 - there's coins and pickups there's
01:16 - dungeons with portals cannons and lava
01:18 - so the final game is really feature rich
01:20 - and once again all of this
01:22 - built without writing a single line of
01:24 - code so this one is more complex thanks
01:26 - to building on top of the knowledge
01:28 - gained while making the platformer game
01:30 - both games are included in course from
01:31 - start to finish and they are set up to
01:33 - provide a nice smooth learning curve
01:35 - so first you'll learn the absolute
01:37 - basics in the platform and then continue
01:39 - learning and apply that based knowledge
01:40 - to the rpg game
01:42 - so this is a great course both for
01:44 - absolute beginners who want to start
01:45 - communicating from scratch and also
01:47 - great for more advanced users who want
01:48 - to see more advanced use cases for
01:50 - visual scripting
01:52 - or just want to see how to design and
01:53 - implement some interesting mechanics
01:55 - even if your goal is writing code
01:57 - instead of visual scripting this course
01:58 - is still very useful
02:00 - i chose to go with program and naming
02:02 - for the visual scripting nodes
02:03 - so if you want to write some code you
02:05 - can easily translate all of these nodes
02:07 - and convert these games into
02:08 - normal c sharp now one thing if you've
02:11 - heard me mention the visual scripting
02:12 - course before you might have noticed
02:14 - that i mentioned three games which were
02:16 - the platformer the action rpg and also a
02:18 - first person shooter
02:20 - now at lunch the course will have the
02:21 - platformer and the rpg game and then the
02:24 - fps project will be added later on as a
02:26 - free update to the course
02:27 - so initially i wanted to launch the
02:29 - course with all of them but my primary
02:31 - focus is always on quality and in order
02:33 - to hit a level of quality for the course
02:34 - that i was happy with
02:36 - these two games took quite a bit longer
02:37 - than expected so instead of making all
02:39 - three games slightly worse i opted to
02:41 - first focus on making these two as high
02:43 - quality as possible
02:44 - and now that i'm really happy with how
02:46 - these two came out i can get to work on
02:47 - making the third one with enough time to
02:49 - make it really high quality
02:51 - so like i said it will be added as a
02:52 - completely free update and it should be
02:54 - done sometime next month
02:56 - okay so if you're interested in the
02:57 - course go to the link in the description
02:59 - and sign up or hit the bell icon and
03:01 - i'll let you know when it's available
03:02 - i'm in the final stages so it shouldn't
03:04 - be done within next week
03:05 - alright so thanks for watching i really
03:07 - hope you'll enjoy the course
03:08 - and i'll see you next time
03:20 - you
