00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - to make a custom UI mesh mask this way
00:04 - we can make a mesh out of any shape and
00:05 - mask out multiple parts of our UI while
00:08 - using just a single mask let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:17 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:19 - and this channel is all about helping
00:21 - you will learn how to make your own
00:22 - games with nf2 torrents made by a
00:24 - professional indie game developer so if
00:26 - you find the video helpful consider
00:27 - subscribing ok so this is one of those
00:30 - videos where I had a problem I did some
00:32 - research and I couldn't really find easy
00:33 - solution so if you're researching the
00:35 - same thing that I was which is how to
00:37 - making a mesh mask in the UI then
00:39 - hopefully this video won't help you now
00:41 - I need this because I wanted to mask
00:43 - multiple parts of the UI I wanted to
00:46 - have multiple lines of text and smoothly
00:48 - reveal each of them you can easily make
00:50 - a mask by creating a UI object adding an
00:52 - image and a mask component and then put
00:54 - whatever you want to mask as a child of
00:56 - that object however in doing it this way
00:58 - you don't mean to do just this image you
01:00 - can mask multiple children but you
01:02 - cannot mask using multiple parents so
01:04 - you cannot compose a mask of multiple
01:06 - objects now one simple solution is to
01:08 - make a texture with the Alpha Channel in
01:10 - the shape that you want
01:11 - so using this texture with two squares
01:13 - and yep it shows both parts of the
01:15 - annoying object however now we using
01:18 - this approach we're working with
01:19 - textures which makes animation relly
01:21 - tricky if I want to animate this I would
01:23 - need to smoothly make some of the mask
01:25 - pixels visible and that would be a very
01:27 - clunky way of doing things I was working
01:29 - on the code monkey steam app which by
01:31 - the way you can connect on link in the
01:32 - description to add it to your wish list
01:34 - I wanted to have some text on the
01:36 - interactive tutorials and using math to
01:38 - show parts of it over time so I needed
01:40 - to combine a mesh with a custom shape
01:42 - that I could easily animate to follow
01:43 - multiple text lines ok so here's what
01:46 - we're going to talk over here is this
01:48 - text object we just a buncha tests and
01:50 - it's inside a mask object now as I press
01:53 - point yep there you go you can see that
01:55 - the mask object is growing and smoothly
01:57 - showing the text now if we pause we can
01:59 - look at the mask and if there's the
02:02 - shape growing which shows the text
02:03 - behind it so we can hide the mask
02:04 - graphic and yep that's how it looks so
02:06 - far doing for a single line will work
02:08 - just fine using a simple image but then
02:10 - the issue is we want this mask to stay
02:13 - invisible and we aren't an add an other
02:15 - one so that we can continue masking out
02:17 - the various other lines so over here is
02:19 - the final result using multiple quads to
02:22 - make a single mesh mask over here you
02:24 - can see the final misshape which is a
02:26 - single mesh which itself is composed of
02:28 - three separate quads
02:29 - so you can build whatever mesh shape you
02:31 - want either through code or by manually
02:33 - building a mesh and using it as a mask
02:36 - so this is how you can make a custom
02:38 - mesh to mask out your UI this videos

02:55 - calm thank you to the patreon sponsor
02:58 - and thank you to these awesome

03:05 - keep the videos free for everyone all
03:07 - right so this circle let's get to it
03:09 - okay so here we are in our starring
03:11 - scene and let's go into the UI canvas
03:14 - here and let's create a text object
03:24 - alright so here's some basic text now we
03:27 - want to mask it so let's first look at
03:29 - how a basic UI mask works and the way we
03:32 - do that is we create a new UI let's make
03:34 - it an image then here we add a component
03:37 - we add a mask component and now to mask
03:40 - something we just need to make it a
03:41 - child of this object so just drag that
03:43 - one on there and yep just like that the
03:45 - text is now only visible whilst inside
03:47 - the shape of this image now right now
03:50 - the source image in here is set to null
03:52 - so this is displaying a basic rectangle
03:54 - but you can assign any texture in here
03:56 - so for example let's use a circle and
03:59 - there you go now the mass takes on the
04:00 - shape of a circle so this is how you
04:02 - make a very basic mask you have the
04:04 - parent with an image and a mask and then
04:06 - you have whatever children you want and
04:08 - it masks out the children now the issue
04:10 - comes when let's say that we want to
04:12 - show this part of the text and then this
04:14 - part as well now since masks works based
04:17 - on the shape of the parent we can only
04:19 - have a single mask shape so the mask
04:21 - works based on what this image is
04:23 - rendered now like I said when possible
04:25 - approach is to make a texture with the
04:27 - shape that you want so down here I have
04:29 - this texture here just two squares and
04:32 - the rest of it is alpha transparent so
04:35 - if instead I apply this one and yep just
04:37 - like that I am masking out two parts of
04:39 - the underlying object so if your goal is
04:42 - just a fixed mass CheY
04:43 - then this approach won't do however
04:45 - since this is based on a texture and
04:47 - it's alpha Channel it makes it very
04:48 - tricky to modify in order to modify it I
04:51 - would have to play around with setting
04:52 - these pixels to fully opaque and so and
04:55 - so on so that would not be the best
04:56 - approach so instead let's create a
04:58 - custom mask shape let's create a new C
05:01 - sharp script call this the mesh mask ey
05:05 - and now here we're going to create our
05:07 - own custom mask type now to do that we
05:10 - just need to extend instead of
05:11 - monobehaviour we're going to extend mask
05:13 - upon graphic which is inside using unity
05:18 - engine dot UI so there it is let's just
05:23 - hit save and see now here and let's
05:25 - remove the mask and our image component
05:27 - and send let's add our nice script and
05:29 - yep just like that already shows a few
05:31 - fields so these are on from the mask
05:33 - eval graphic base class now for now
05:35 - let's leave everything at default let's
05:37 - just change the color to a nice green to
05:39 - make it very visible all right now back
05:42 - in the code here in order to make our
05:44 - custom mesh we're going to override one
05:46 - of the functions it's called the
05:47 - populate mesh now this one gets called
05:52 - automatically by the UI system to create
05:54 - the mesh of our mask ammonal graphic and
05:56 - this function has an argument of type
05:58 - vertex helper so it's a nice humper
06:00 - class to help us handle mesh shapes now
06:02 - the first thing we do is to make sure
06:04 - that you clear whatever the current
06:05 - shape of our mesh is so you're going to
06:07 - the vertex comfort and we just call
06:09 - clear okay and now it's in here that we
06:13 - can set up our customized shape so let's
06:14 - start off with a very simple square all
06:20 - right we have to find a position for all
06:22 - our vertices and then we just access the
06:24 - vertex helper to add a UI vertex quad
06:35 - all right so just like that now one
06:38 - thing here in order for this to actually
06:39 - work we need to give the UI vertex a
06:41 - color if you only were to add empty it
06:44 - just won't work I'm not sure why but
06:46 - just give it a random color and it works
06:48 - so this is really all it takes we clear
06:50 - the current my shape and then we add our
06:52 - custom vertices and if we go back into
06:54 - the editor any for any way we see our
06:57 - mask shape so here there is just basic
06:59 - quad with 50 by 50 all right great
07:02 - so our object is creating the mesh and
07:05 - making it masculine and in order to make
07:07 - it an actual mask we just need to add
07:09 - the mask component and just like that
07:11 - yep there it is and we can either show
07:13 - or hide the mask graphic okay so now
07:15 - let's see how this helps us solve the
07:17 - original problem of having a mask with
07:19 - multiple shapes down here we can make
07:21 - another UI vertex quad alright so we
07:31 - have our original quad and one next to
07:33 - it and if we go back and if there is we
07:36 - have our two visual quads so we have a
07:38 - single mask parent and by using a custom
07:41 - mesh we can mask out multiple areas of
07:43 - our underlying object so there it is
07:45 - alright awesome now we need to do is
07:47 - really just extend upon this concept so
07:50 - here let's try and making our mask let's
07:52 - just increase the size over time all
07:58 - right just like that we should see a
08:00 - rectangle stretching however when you go
08:02 - back here it doesn't actually work so
08:04 - our mesh shape is not actually
08:06 - increasing that is because we are
08:08 - missing one thing which is in here the
08:10 - UI system only calls this function when
08:12 - it absolutely needs you meaning that it
08:14 - does not call it automatically on every
08:16 - frame so if we want to do that we can
08:19 - make our predatory update and in here we
08:21 - tell it to update on vertices so we just
08:24 - go set vertices as dirty and they won't
08:26 - update so just like that now this should
08:29 - update on every frame and if there it is
08:31 - now we have our custom mess shape and
08:33 - mating over time awesome all right so
08:36 - now with this you can obviously use
08:38 - whatever mashup you want it doesn't have
08:40 - to be just a simple rectangle so for
08:43 - example you could make a mesh in the
08:44 - shape of a star and just rotate around
08:45 - or really any
08:47 - you want to animate and in any way you
08:49 - want alright so here is the final script
09:06 - that I made for the code monkey steam
09:08 - app it has the mesh mesh UI script then
09:11 - as a child of it it has the same text
09:13 - object and then over here I have a
09:15 - container with a bunch of children and
09:17 - each of them has a simple script just
09:18 - with two fields so just a fold for the
09:21 - start time and another one for the total
09:23 - time so that's eternal amount of time
09:25 - that this rectangle will take to reach
09:26 - its final shape so this object has this
09:28 - shape and each of them is covering one
09:30 - line and then they must mesh you why
09:32 - over here has a reference to the mask
09:34 - container and it simply applies those
09:36 - masks let's see there it is and all of a
09:38 - sudden yep there you go there's the
09:40 - masked shape being created over time so
09:42 - here it is with the game and the scene
09:43 - view side by side and you can indeed see
09:45 - the mesh shape constantly growing so
09:47 - this is a great way to smoothly scroll
09:49 - over some text in any matter you want as
09:51 - I said I researched this while working
09:53 - on the code monkey steam app if you
09:55 - haven't yet then please check the link
09:57 - in the description and add it to your
09:58 - wish list I'm trying to build something
09:59 - really cool and it should hopefully be

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to learn how to make a custom UI mesh mask this way we can make a mesh out of any shape and mask out multiple parts of our UI while using just a single mask let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you will learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing ok so this is one of those videos where I had a problem I did some research and I couldn't really find easy solution so if you're researching the same thing that I was which is how to making a mesh mask in the UI then hopefully this video won't help you now I need this because I wanted to mask multiple parts of the UI I wanted to have multiple lines of text and smoothly reveal each of them you can easily make a mask by creating a UI object adding an image and a mask component and then put whatever you want to mask as a child of that object however in doing

them out at bat Adventure calm thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone all right so this circle let's get to it okay so here we are in our starring scene and let's go into the UI canvas here and let's create a text object alright so here's some basic text now we want to mask it so let's first look at how a basic UI mask works and the way we do that is we create a new UI let's make it an image then here we add a component we add a
