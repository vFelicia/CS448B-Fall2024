01:49 - thank you
02:17 - [Music]
02:20 - alright hey everyone how's it going
02:22 - thanks for being here
02:24 - all right
02:26 - quite a lot of people already here wow
02:28 - nice thank you
02:30 - all right so hopefully this should be
02:32 - fun okay everything seems to be correct
02:34 - all right
02:38 - okay great all right thank you Daniel
02:41 - for becoming a channel member and thanks
02:43 - again for sharing for a nice cup of
02:45 - coffee that's always useful so thank you
02:47 - so much
02:48 - all right hey everyone okay
02:51 - impressed this kind of inventory you
02:53 - have you mean the characters yeah I've
02:55 - been working on this lately usually I
02:58 - got my characters on on screen but for
02:59 - this one for this stream I'm planning to
03:02 - try out something different so we're
03:04 - going to make a sort of q a sort of a
03:08 - quiz where I can post a question then
03:10 - you can vote in chat and then we can see
03:12 - and learn a bunch of things together
03:14 - that's pretty much the goal with this
03:15 - live stream as usual it's an experiment
03:18 - so hopefully it won't break so hopefully
03:21 - everything here so far is working
03:22 - correctly all right
03:25 - okay great so let's see how this goes
03:31 - all right so just first of all just for
03:33 - testing let me actually make a simple
03:36 - question
03:38 - so just for testing
03:44 - let's go Create a quiz
03:47 - and there you go
03:48 - all right so let me just
03:50 - hide the background where's my
03:53 - background the background okay great all
03:55 - right so there you go a very
03:57 - simple and basic quiz and basically you
03:59 - vote in chat by doing vote and then
04:01 - either A or B
04:03 - that's pretty much the goal and let's
04:05 - see if all of this works correctly
04:07 - so as you vote there you go the little
04:09 - characters they move there it's recently
04:12 - but all right look at that
04:15 - all right that's great so far it seems
04:17 - to be working correctly all right
04:21 - so we got a lot of votes
04:23 - seems to be pretty much 50 50. so that's
04:26 - interesting so I'm going to vote myself
04:28 - a zone so in my case I'm going to go
04:30 - with dogs so I'm going to vote B
04:34 - and there you go
04:36 - all right and look at that cats are
04:38 - winning
04:39 - all right I mean I'm just happy that
04:42 - it's working so yeah
04:47 - so basically yeah instead of just saying
04:49 - A or B say uh uh uh exclamation point
04:54 - vote and then either A or B
04:58 - so basically all the people that are
05:00 - still waiting they are up here and then
05:03 - the character moves into one or the
05:04 - other position once you actually vote
05:08 - and actually mine did not move
05:13 - did I find some bug no there you go
05:15 - there's my character
05:16 - going into the B position
05:18 - all right great
05:20 - look at that it's pretty much 50 30. uh
05:24 - that's funny
05:27 - all right but yeah look at that
05:28 - perfectly 50 50 oh dog's winning
05:32 - okay so the system is indeed working all
05:35 - right
05:36 - and then well the next part is when
05:40 - there's a question when the time is just
05:42 - visual so I can then manually end it and
05:45 - I can either say one question is correct
05:47 - or all of them are correct so in this
05:49 - case
05:50 - um they are correct so let's go ahead
05:52 - end the quiz and there you go they're
05:54 - all correct they're all happy everybody
05:56 - succeed all right great okay so it seems
06:00 - the system is working so far so that's
06:02 - right
06:03 - so there you go can I vote C none of
06:05 - them no really no
06:07 - and right away I noticed there's a bug
06:10 - seeing the aren't supposed to be visible
06:12 - so apparently when I finish they all
06:13 - become green but that's okay all right
06:15 - that works fine
06:17 - all right okay
06:20 - okay so basically I'm going to try to
06:23 - show some questions and you can vote on
06:24 - the answer then I can talk about some
06:27 - learning thing related to the question
06:28 - and in meantime sure you can post
06:31 - questions in
06:32 - in chat and I'll do my best to try to
06:34 - keep this thing managed okay
06:38 - in some kind of
06:41 - YouTube integration yes this is using
06:43 - the uh the Youtube API
06:46 - and if you want to customize your own
06:49 - character just like you can see a bunch
06:51 - of people have custom characters then I
06:53 - see a Spider-Man around here somewhere
06:56 - uh anyway there's my character which has
06:58 - a custom Sprite and there you go look at
07:00 - that there's a nice Raymond so
07:01 - Timberland Jones there you go and ice on
07:04 - anybody else using custom characters
07:07 - nope just one all right so yeah
07:10 - basically you can go into this link and
07:13 - if you want you can draw on top of it
07:14 - and then your character won't have a
07:16 - custom Sprite so it's just a nice fun
07:18 - thing
07:19 - and if you want to know how I made this
07:21 - I actually also covered it down here
07:23 - there's a bunch of links so there's the
07:25 - transparency window which actually isn't
07:27 - being used here this is just a regular
07:28 - window then the characters they are
07:30 - using some mesh based animations and for
07:33 - interacting with the YouTube API that is
07:34 - using an HTTP request from Unity that's
07:37 - pretty much it so oh no something pretty
07:39 - simple but yeah it looks pretty fun look
07:41 - at that ring man that looks pretty cool
07:43 - okay great all right so let me just get
07:47 - ready to start posting the first proper
07:49 - question
07:51 - once again thank you so much for sharing
07:53 - for the cup of coffee thank you so much
07:54 - and thank you Daniel new channel
07:55 - remember so this one oh look at that a
07:57 - new channel member thank you unless
07:59 - thank you that's cool it's awesome when
08:01 - I come back to this overlay and
08:03 - everything suddenly Works magically
08:05 - uh asking what happened to the
08:07 - multiplayer section yep I'm still
08:08 - working on it I'm currently researching
08:10 - what is the best way to convert the game
08:13 - to multiplayer so I'm selling the
08:15 - research phase then I've got to I've got
08:17 - to make a prototype then I have to
08:19 - record on uh write on the lectures then
08:21 - I have to record everything then I have
08:22 - to edit and then publish so hopefully by
08:25 - the end of this month it should have the
08:27 - multiplayer course should be out
08:29 - hopefully by the end of this month
08:30 - hopefully
08:32 - all right okay so
08:35 - let me first post a first post the first
08:39 - question
08:40 - okay this is a bit tricky because I
08:42 - gotta do it manually but sure let me
08:44 - just put it can I put it side by side
08:46 - okay like that's good
08:48 - okay so that's the first option
08:51 - and the second option the third option
08:53 - and hopefully everything won't work
08:55 - correctly
08:56 - there you go create quiz and there you
08:57 - go the brand new question so what is the
08:59 - name of the game relating to the game in
09:02 - the free course so is it kitchen chaos
09:04 - cloner cooked or Chef chaos so go ahead
09:07 - and post your vote in the chat
09:09 - and let's see if all of you know
09:11 - all right
09:14 - and obviously on the side here I've got
09:16 - the page for the websites on we're going
09:18 - to go through a bunch of lectures and
09:20 - answer a bunch of questions do a bunch
09:22 - of things
09:23 - so let's see if one of you know the
09:25 - first basic question I mean the clue is
09:26 - kind of on screen but yeah let's see
09:29 - let's see if all of you know it just
09:31 - expand a little bit all right
09:34 - all right look at that so there's two
09:36 - song Theory people on C and for some
09:39 - reason some people aren't even though
09:40 - there's no d right now some people
09:42 - wouldn't be and most people over here on
09:44 - a there you go look that all those
09:46 - people there's Raymond there oh look
09:49 - there's a Spiderman I know who all right
09:51 - that's nice another Rayman
09:54 - is it supposed to have two Raymonds or
09:56 - is that a bug I don't know okay
10:00 - let me vote myself as well so I'm going
10:02 - to vote a
10:04 - so let's see
10:07 - and all right
10:14 - okay so there's something time left
10:17 - actually played around with the timer I
10:21 - mean hey yep there you are
10:25 - all right
10:29 - for phone to PC that's why there's two
10:30 - Raymonds yeah maybe
10:32 - it's just funny that's great
10:37 - voting you won't crash everything no
10:38 - hopefully not you can try to vote e just
10:41 - won't do anything just won't recognize
10:42 - because at most there's only four
10:44 - options so hopefully the code is correct
10:46 - how do we change our character sprite
10:48 - just follow the guide on the website
10:51 - all right so there you go there's a
10:53 - question and let me go ahead and the
10:55 - quiz and the correct one for this one is
10:58 - obviously a kitchen chaos someone's in
11:00 - the quiz and there you go everybody's
11:02 - really happy
11:03 - nice okay so most people got it right
11:06 - some people see them waiting some people
11:08 - put BNC and so on and over here we've
11:10 - got the leaderboard so let's see by the
11:12 - end how many so pretty much this is the
11:14 - number of correct questions and on the
11:16 - right side is the percentage so right
11:18 - now so far two correct questions 100 so
11:21 - pretty much everybody over here on the
11:22 - on the leaderboards all of them got it
11:24 - right
11:26 - and everything suddenly froze oh God
11:30 - something bad happened
11:31 - actually something bad apparently didn't
11:33 - happen
11:35 - uh
11:38 - uh exactly happened
11:43 - not sure but okay let's keep going and
11:46 - hopefully it won't break completely
11:49 - if there's something strange move
11:51 - position direct was destroyed
11:56 - okay all right anyways
11:59 - hopefully everything is still working
12:01 - correctly all right so that's great so
12:03 - I've validated that my nice little tool
12:05 - that's where someone for the no it's not
12:08 - because someone voted e Apparently one
12:10 - of these characters was destroyed for
12:11 - some reason but then some code is still
12:14 - getting it so right over here can I put
12:17 - it here there you go got a missing
12:19 - reference exception so some object is
12:20 - still finding something so it kind of
12:22 - broke but let's hope it doesn't actually
12:24 - cause a crash anyways if it does I can
12:27 - only just restart it I've got a nice
12:29 - load for the leaderboard so that should
12:31 - be fun and thank you once again and
12:33 - listen there you go and you shall
12:34 - remember another one rookie thank you so
12:37 - much all right that's nice I don't know
12:40 - how many channel members this has so
12:42 - it's a fun feature all right okay so let
12:44 - me just
12:45 - so yes the answer of course was kitchen
12:47 - chaosa was the correct answer so here it
12:49 - is it's a fun name I don't like it I
12:51 - think it was cool
12:52 - all right so let's begin
12:55 - let's see so let's see another easy
12:57 - question just make sure that you all
12:59 - understand how to vote
13:02 - so let's go just basing in all of the
13:05 - options and create the quiz there you go
13:08 - here is the new question so Hong Kong is
13:09 - the free course is it a two hours B five
13:12 - hours or C 10 hours
13:15 - so let's see if all of you know how much
13:16 - is it
13:17 - so let's see
13:20 - all right
13:23 - they're going lots of votes I'm going to
13:25 - vote myself as well
13:27 - which is kind of odd though because if
13:29 - you can see me then technically you know
13:31 - yeah maybe I shouldn't vote otherwise
13:33 - that might be a little bit cheating when
13:35 - it becomes a more complex questions so
13:38 - let's see all right
13:42 - and there you go most people voting on
13:44 - 10 hours
13:47 - let's see if that is indeed correct all
13:48 - right
13:49 - like about font front Sprite for Rayman
13:52 - looks really weird now yeah with all of
13:55 - the other ones facing forward but so I
13:57 - think Rayman looks great I mean when I
13:59 - was coming up with design for these
14:00 - characters for this machine mission
14:02 - system actually it was around the time
14:04 - when Prison Architect came out
14:06 - so that was more the sort of inspiration
14:08 - doing something simple like that rather
14:10 - than Raymond but yep Raymond also works
14:12 - perfectly with this tunnel since there
14:14 - are no arms and so on yeah this matter
14:16 - seeks capital or not nope on the code I
14:18 - made sure to check for that so if you
14:20 - post if you write with or without space
14:22 - it works if you put an uppercase on
14:24 - lowercase it works so hopefully it
14:26 - should work most of the time
14:29 - new sound pop-up is UI in unity
14:32 - oh yeah yeah this is inside Unity so
14:34 - here is a window I can even drag it and
14:36 - so on so yeah this one is inside Unity
14:39 - it is not a OBS uh element even though
14:42 - those are sometimes fun
14:44 - even vote box looks weird especially
14:46 - since it looks to the side oh right if
14:49 - you purchased
14:51 - right here moving that yeah I guess if
14:54 - he moves down that would be yeah then
14:55 - actually see movie if he moves on I
14:58 - guess that would be a bit tricky
15:00 - I got a meal from him is that so that's
15:02 - great all right so yeah let's end this
15:04 - one and obviously the correct question
15:05 - is indeed C so let's put the answer
15:08 - isn't DT so let's end the quiz and there
15:10 - you go all of them celebrating so yep
15:12 - that is indeed the correct question all
15:14 - right so congrats everyone that's great
15:18 - how did you do that you mean the
15:20 - elements one they are using the uh
15:22 - YouTube API and if you want to know how
15:24 - to make you just pretty much just have
15:26 - to do an HTTP request
15:28 - from inside unity and you can interact
15:30 - with the YouTube API and that's pretty
15:32 - much how it works so you can watch that
15:33 - video and that's pretty much how it goes
15:36 - was there a guy on age hearing maybe he
15:38 - was on the way to see and that is why he
15:40 - stopped in the middle when I stopped so
15:42 - that's probably why all right okay so
15:44 - let's go
15:46 - and yeah let's start with a proper
15:51 - question
15:52 - so let's go create the quiz let me
15:54 - select all of the possible options
15:58 - and this one and this one and let's put
16:03 - it like that and let's see okay so let's
16:05 - create a brand new question okay so here
16:07 - it is so this is on the lecture for the
16:10 - creative project and the question is
16:12 - which anti version did I use in the
16:13 - course so was it the 2021 LTS the 2022
16:17 - Tech version or was it the 23 Alpha
16:19 - version
16:20 - so go ahead post your votes and this one
16:22 - is with regards to the create project
16:25 - manager so by the way over here on the
16:27 - website here is the course molecule and
16:29 - if you click on one of these it
16:30 - automatically Scrolls down so there you
16:32 - go the question is related to in lecture
16:33 - one for creating the project
16:37 - all right so people voting some people
16:39 - saying LTS some people saying tech let's
16:41 - see which is which
16:43 - all right
16:53 - okay so there you go everybody Boeing
16:57 - all right
17:00 - foreign
17:06 - end the quiz and see which one is the
17:10 - correct question correct answer
17:12 - and there you go you have the correct
17:14 - answer is indeed over here B and it is
17:16 - the tech version
17:17 - so usually Technically when it comes to
17:19 - UNT versions you should probably stick
17:21 - with the NTS version but the only reason
17:23 - why I went with the tech version for
17:25 - this uh course is because I want the
17:27 - course I want the video to stay up to
17:29 - date for as long as possible so
17:31 - technically usually you should use LTS I
17:34 - just went to Tech because Tech is going
17:35 - to translate going to turn into the LTS
17:38 - version in about two weeks two months so
17:41 - yes technically you should always use
17:42 - LTS the only reason why I didn't is to
17:44 - make sure that the video stays up to
17:46 - date for as long as possible but yeah in
17:48 - your own projects definitely stick with
17:49 - LTS which in about two or three months
17:51 - usually around March or April that's
17:54 - when Unity launches their brand new MTS
17:56 - version So at around that time 22 should
17:58 - turn into LTS so at that time you should
18:00 - be able to use that one
18:02 - all right so there you go that's a nice
18:04 - question
18:05 - and everything is a bit a bit like that
18:09 - yeah maybe I'll I'll restart the overall
18:12 - oh no it's good now okay I don't know
18:14 - sometimes becomes a bit strange all
18:16 - right and once again thank you so much
18:18 - for becoming Channel member another one
18:20 - Timbo Jones yeah thank you thank you for
18:22 - becoming a channel member thank you
18:24 - all right okay so that was the first
18:27 - proper question so congratulations and
18:29 - over here on the right side still see a
18:30 - bunch of people with all four correct
18:32 - 100 so that's great let's see let's see
18:35 - how much this one is by the end okay
18:38 - all right so let's go for the next
18:40 - question so let's create a brand new
18:43 - quiz
18:45 - for this lecture
18:47 - go with yes
18:50 - or no
18:56 - and there you go all right so let's see
18:59 - the next question so let's create the
19:01 - quiz and there you go here is the
19:02 - question so this one is with regards to
19:04 - lecture two so that's in layout picture
19:06 - so this one is do you know about the
19:08 - pivot Center and local logo buttons so
19:11 - do you yes no maybe can you repeat the
19:13 - question so let's see who gets this
19:16 - reference and yeah there you go so the
19:19 - questions with regards to the pivot
19:20 - Center and local Global buttons these
19:22 - are extremely important you definitely
19:24 - need to know about them so let's see how
19:26 - many of you know about them so this one
19:28 - is kind of a general knowledge question
19:30 - so let's see but it is something that I
19:32 - cover in the unity layout lecture
19:35 - so let's see out of this question
19:39 - all right
19:41 - so most people are getting TS that's
19:43 - awesome
19:44 - because this is actually two very
19:46 - important buttons that a lot of people
19:48 - don't know about so yeah
19:51 - someone asking how many questions are
19:53 - there in total I'm not sure I mean I
19:54 - think that's going to be limited to the
19:56 - time for the live stream so I'm going to
19:58 - do this for about one hour so let's see
20:00 - how many questions we can get through in
20:03 - that time okay
20:06 - all right so there you go still got a
20:07 - bit more and over here on the side I've
20:09 - got a nice
20:10 - test project so I can use that one to
20:13 - demonstrate whether something is all
20:15 - right so let's see
20:20 - there you go 20 seconds
20:23 - how many of you yes six people no 11
20:25 - Maybe
20:27 - until you repeat the question
20:29 - all right so let's see do you know about
20:31 - these buttons
20:35 - for some reason the owners constantly
20:37 - doing something that's strange uh all
20:40 - right okay so let's go ahead end the
20:42 - quiz and for this one there's really no
20:45 - wrong answer because it's a general so
20:47 - congratulations to all of you all right
20:49 - so the pivot Center on local button so
20:51 - let me put a nice testing window over
20:53 - here so here is a basic testing project
20:56 - just to test it out and basically the
20:57 - buttons that I'm referring to are the
20:59 - ones up here on the scene view so
21:00 - there's this one on this side which says
21:02 - Center or pivot and there's another one
21:04 - which is global or local and basically
21:06 - these are extremely important so for
21:08 - example if you've got a game object
21:09 - let's make it a cube instead so let's
21:11 - make an empty Cube there you go here is
21:14 - a cube
21:15 - and if inside I put another object so
21:19 - let's say I put another Cube inside this
21:21 - Cube and for this other Cube let's put
21:23 - it somewhere on the sign
21:25 - so now if I select the parent object and
21:28 - if over there it is Select non-pivot
21:30 - look at where the transform handle is
21:32 - it's right there it's exactly on the
21:34 - origin of that object however if up
21:36 - there if now I change to center now
21:38 - instead of being on the pivot now it's
21:39 - over there on the center so if you
21:41 - didn't know about this and for example
21:42 - you tried rotating now if you try
21:44 - rotating you would assume that it would
21:46 - rotate right over there where the handle
21:48 - is but if you move to the side
21:50 - and actually right now yeah right
21:52 - because it's moving on the if you look
21:54 - over there it is now rotating just on
21:56 - the Y but also moving on the X and also
21:58 - moving on the Z so if I move it even
22:00 - further away and now it's like this one
22:03 - there you go with that one set to center
22:04 - now it actually selects the transform
22:06 - handle right on the center and if I
22:08 - rotate it look over there it's not just
22:10 - rotating on the Y if I rotate on the
22:12 - wire it rotates like this but if I
22:14 - rotate on the handle it rotates like
22:15 - that
22:16 - so this is something that is usually
22:18 - very confusing if you don't know what is
22:19 - going on so if you were to rotate here
22:21 - you would be very confused as to why
22:23 - it's not rotating around the tool handle
22:24 - so that is why this is extremely
22:26 - important and pretty much in 99 of cases
22:28 - you want to leave this one on pivot
22:30 - that's that way it makes sense so if you
22:32 - rotate over there it rotates on the
22:34 - pivot exactly as it should so example
22:36 - like this
22:37 - and the next one that one is the local
22:39 - or Global so that is with regards to
22:42 - rotation so for example let's say on the
22:45 - parent I rotate this one let's rotate it
22:47 - point it upwards like this
22:49 - so like this this is set on local mode
22:51 - and look at how the handles are rotated
22:54 - kind of slanted whereas if I put this in
22:56 - global now the handles have the global
22:58 - rotation
23:01 - so regardless of how the object is
23:02 - rotated these are always like this so if
23:04 - I move over here on the red arrow you
23:07 - would assume that it moves just on the I
23:09 - think the red is the Zen or now it's in
23:11 - CX you would think by this you would
23:13 - only move on the X
23:15 - whereas if I put it on local if I put
23:18 - them like this this one is moved based
23:19 - on the rotation that the object is in so
23:21 - if you want to put an object in front of
23:23 - it somewhere like this and you won't
23:25 - just push the object to the side then
23:27 - it's usually better to use it on local
23:28 - whereas if you want to move it relative
23:30 - to the world itself put it on global and
23:32 - move it around
23:33 - so yeah basically these two are some of
23:36 - the things that can really drive you
23:37 - crazy if you don't know about them so in
23:39 - most cases you really want to leave this
23:40 - one on pivot and this one either on
23:42 - local or Global depending on the use
23:44 - case so that's one of those things that
23:46 - a lot of people don't know about and can
23:47 - definitely drive you crazy if you don't
23:49 - know so hopefully now a bunch of you
23:50 - have learned something new so hopefully
23:52 - that's nice
23:54 - all right so that was a question and
23:55 - that one there was no wrong answer so
23:57 - congratulations to all of you
23:59 - all right great
24:02 - why do you name the channel and Code
24:03 - Monkey
24:04 - I always like the the term Code Monkey
24:06 - even though technically it's supposed to
24:08 - be kind of a negative but I always found
24:11 - it was pretty fun so yeah when I
24:13 - actually wanted to name my my game
24:15 - Studio I wanted to name it that
24:18 - but there was already a developer called
24:21 - Code Monkey so I couldn't use it for my
24:22 - game Studio but when it came time to
24:24 - making it for this
24:25 - for this YouTube channel for this one
24:27 - decided hey why don't I go back to that
24:29 - to that idea that I had previously so
24:31 - yeah and yep there's also a song called
24:34 - Code Monkey which is almost so pretty
24:36 - fun
24:37 - all right okay so let's go and thank you
24:40 - so much Timbo Jones thank you all right
24:42 - okay so let's go into the next question
24:44 - so this one is going to be on the
24:46 - lecture on Visual Studio
24:48 - so let's go ahead create the quiz all
24:50 - right so here is the question so in the
24:52 - lecture for visual studio so what Visual
24:54 - Studio extension did I use for the extra
24:55 - colors in the code so was it called
24:58 - Commodore plus is it nothing is it just
25:00 - a visual studio this phone defaults or
25:03 - is it vs4 so go ahead post your votes
25:09 - and let me open up visual studio over
25:12 - here just so we can see in a little bit
25:15 - all right
25:19 - there you go a bunch of votes coming in
25:22 - okay all right my visual studio is
25:26 - opening
25:27 - let me just make sure that I
25:30 - uh I always forget where the extensions
25:35 - the installed ones yep that's what I'm
25:38 - okay great uh now let me go back and see
25:41 - chat because I can't see it right now
25:44 - all right there you go Okay so
25:48 - go ahead if I knew this was coming up on
25:50 - the test I'd have studied more for it
25:52 - yep I mean everything is on the test so
25:55 - yeah go ahead and
25:57 - hopefully this helps you gain some
25:59 - knowledge that's going with this with
26:01 - this nice little live stream so we can
26:02 - all learn together and hopefully it
26:05 - should be fun
26:06 - all right okay
26:08 - so there you go 20 seconds left go ahead
26:10 - and post your vote so it seems a lot of
26:11 - people are confident in seeing is that
26:13 - correct some people are still over here
26:15 - stuck on D I don't know why because
26:17 - there's no d right now but yeah all
26:20 - right so let's see which one is correct
26:24 - make my game using kitchen Carol's
26:26 - assets yep go ahead and use yes in your
26:28 - own projects
26:30 - I hope you like it I skipped this one so
26:32 - I'm doing the majority yeah usually that
26:34 - is probably a a a good approach in this
26:38 - little quiz if you go with the majority
26:39 - I wonder maybe there's a question that
26:42 - the majority won't go wrong I don't know
26:44 - let's see all right so let's go ahead
26:46 - and see which one is the correct answer
26:48 - and the correct answer is C indeed it is
26:51 - the ashfora yep so that it is my
26:54 - character isn't appearing yep there it
26:55 - is right there
26:56 - all right so this is a really nice
26:59 - extension let me just
27:02 - so here is my visual studio and
27:04 - basically on extensions magic extensions
27:07 - and over here if you search for online
27:09 - you'll find vsphora
27:12 - and there you go it adds color to your
27:13 - Visual Studio text editor so this is the
27:16 - one that I use in the course and
27:17 - basically what it does it adds a bunch
27:19 - more colors so look at this over here
27:21 - the default in the case in a nice pink
27:22 - so the switch and nice orange and the
27:25 - types in a different color than the
27:27 - functions in another color then the
27:29 - built-in Unity functions in a different
27:31 - color and so on so basically adds a
27:33 - whole bunch of colors let me see if I've
27:34 - got a more complex project somewhere in
27:38 - here so I've got a big project
27:41 - uh let me find something a bit more
27:44 - complex
27:46 - okay so let's see this on the game
27:48 - Handler setup
27:49 - and there you go so we got a bunch more
27:51 - colors so like this with all these
27:52 - colors you know there you go nice string
27:55 - nice comments so with this I find this
27:57 - is a it's pretty much the only extension
27:59 - that I have outside of defaults and I
28:01 - find that it helps quite a lot having
28:03 - all these colors really makes the code
28:04 - much easier to read much easier to see
28:06 - okay here's the return else if and so on
28:09 - here's the type of function call and so
28:11 - on so yep I would definitely recommend
28:13 - you grab this extension so that is
28:15 - called and yep 61 of you did indeed
28:19 - correctly guess so yep congratulations
28:22 - all right
28:25 - okay so that was the correct answer okay
28:27 - what about resharper that's an add-on
28:30 - yeah I've heard great things about
28:31 - resharper but I've never actually used
28:33 - it too much but yeah I do know that it
28:35 - does a lot of things same thing with uh
28:37 - what is it called jetbrains Rider a lot
28:40 - of people also like that idea for me I
28:42 - stick when I stick with the visual
28:44 - studio just because it's what I know but
28:46 - yeah
28:47 - basically nowadays there's pretty much
28:48 - no wrong option anything you choose all
28:51 - the tools nowadays are pretty excellent
28:53 - so yeah sorry I don't know if there's a
28:55 - similar one for for Rider no idea
29:00 - is there an alternative for vs format oh
29:03 - yeah that's right I'm sorry I don't
29:05 - think they're I mean I'm sure there is
29:07 - so if you search for something
29:10 - oh right there is made by the same
29:12 - company that made Richard oh really I
29:14 - didn't know that that's nice uh yeah so
29:16 - for visual studio on Mac you probably
29:18 - need to Google it I'm sure there's there
29:20 - has to be something related to I mean
29:22 - it's just that in color so there has to
29:24 - be but yeah sorry I don't know it's a
29:27 - vs4 is Windows only so yeah don't really
29:30 - know for that one okay
29:35 - all right so that's the question and
29:37 - over here on the right side yep it's
29:39 - only got a bunch of people with a
29:40 - hundred percent I wonder how long is
29:42 - this going to keep up all right so let's
29:44 - see
29:45 - the next question
29:49 - did I close this question I did right
29:51 - yeah now I forget uh yeah okay so let's
29:54 - see the next question
29:56 - so this one is from lecture four
30:01 - so over here let me just scroll down to
30:03 - lecture 4 which is one of the most
30:04 - important lectures it's a lecture on
30:06 - code style and naming rules so let's see
30:09 - what is the question
30:10 - and there you go okay so here's the
30:12 - question which is which one of these is
30:14 - correct so Pascal case camel case and
30:17 - snake case
30:18 - all right so go ahead and make your
30:19 - votes and which one of these is correct
30:23 - these are the names for the
30:25 - capitalization of the letters the words
30:28 - and so on
30:29 - so these are the three main types that
30:32 - most people use
30:34 - so Pascal case is it capitalized in
30:37 - front and middle or is it uh lowercase
30:39 - over there uppercase in there is camel
30:42 - case and lowercase and then uppercase or
30:43 - upper and upper is it lower and then
30:46 - phone case is snake case with an
30:49 - underscore with Dash with DOT let's see
30:52 - which one is it
30:54 - okay all right so go ahead make your
30:57 - votes
30:58 - and let us see all right so a lot of
31:00 - people are really confident in a so is
31:03 - that the one that is correct
31:07 - all right I just decided on Unity versus
31:09 - other platforms when I started which was
31:12 - back in 2012 that was when I started
31:15 - researching uh game engines because I
31:17 - wanted to move on from Flash and make
31:18 - something that I could play on my on my
31:21 - PC and yeah back then Unity was the only
31:24 - option so it kind of went by default but
31:26 - yeah since then uh it works for building
31:29 - any kind of game that I can think of so
31:31 - yeah
31:31 - that is why so I started because it was
31:34 - the only option and I kept with it
31:36 - because it's a great tool works great so
31:38 - that's pretty much the answer
31:40 - all right so which one is correct and
31:43 - everybody is really confident on a
31:45 - there's a bunch of people lost here on D
31:47 - A bunch of people on c and a bunch of
31:49 - people on B love you hey and love you
31:51 - too thanks for being here all right so
31:54 - let us see let's end the quiz and let's
31:57 - see which one is indeed correct and if
32:00 - there you go it is indeed option A so
32:02 - congratulations to all of you all right
32:04 - that's awesome it's awesome that so many
32:06 - people didn't know this one all right
32:08 - that was great
32:09 - yeah that is great so yeah if you
32:14 - if you haven't seen the course yet
32:15 - definitely go ahead watch a YouTube
32:17 - video it's linked in the description and
32:19 - definitely make sure to pay attention to
32:20 - this lecture specifically just learning
32:23 - this is one of the things that will
32:25 - massively grow your skills as a
32:26 - programmer so definitely make sure you
32:28 - always use the correct naming rules I
32:31 - mean correct is a bit of a wrong word
32:32 - the important thing is that you are
32:34 - consistent so whatever naming rules you
32:36 - follow doesn't matter you can follow
32:38 - Pascal case for functions or maybe use
32:40 - pastel case for for class names or maybe
32:43 - use it for fields or maybe properties
32:45 - whatever you want so you can use
32:46 - whatever naming rules on whatever thing
32:49 - you want the most important thing when
32:51 - it comes to code style naming rules just
32:52 - being consistent so whatever you do
32:54 - whatever you choose come up with a sound
32:57 - that makes sense to you and then stick
32:58 - with it that's pretty much it alright so
33:01 - congratulations to all of you where's my
33:02 - character there you go somewhere in here
33:05 - what should I do when I finish your
33:07 - course well you can go and try building
33:08 - an original game if you want go ahead
33:11 - take the knowledge that you gained from
33:12 - the course and try building something
33:14 - nice and original and hopefully you will
33:16 - have gained quite a nice amount of
33:18 - knowledge that won't enable you to build
33:19 - pretty much any game you can
33:23 - okay so yeah congratulations once again
33:25 - and over here almost there got a bunch
33:27 - of people not on 100 which is great
33:29 - because it means that hopefully you'll
33:31 - learn something new so definitely don't
33:33 - feel bad if you get one of these
33:34 - questions wrong the home point is to
33:36 - learn so yeah if you get it wrong you
33:38 - can learn something then that is awesome
33:40 - you learned it all right great
33:44 - okay
33:45 - Turtle it's been two years since I
33:47 - started my Kim Dev journey and even the
33:49 - most helpful person hey Aaron Collins VR
33:51 - hey that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad
33:54 - to hear that I'm always very happy to
33:56 - hear that people have enjoyed tutorials
33:58 - that they have helped you in any way so
34:00 - yeah that is awesome best of luck in all
34:02 - of your Game Dev Journeys and all of
34:04 - your individual ones hopefully the
34:06 - videos help you so we can all just make
34:08 - games and have fun together so hopefully
34:11 - all right
34:13 - some kept the boxes in there yeah
34:15 - they're like oh hey CPU hey thanks for
34:17 - being here yeah there you go got a bunch
34:19 - more custom characters yeah keeping the
34:22 - boxes in there the Box are meant for
34:23 - guiding you don't necessarily
34:25 - but yeah it's kind of funny head right
34:27 - and there you go it is the head pointing
34:28 - right
34:29 - all right okay so let's go on to the
34:31 - next question yeah I think I'm going a
34:33 - bit slow because it's already been 40
34:35 - minutes okay so let's go let's
34:39 - I keep forgetting that if I end the the
34:41 - question or not I think I did yeah okay
34:44 - so the next one is on post-processing
34:46 - and once again we are going to have
34:50 - another interesting four options
34:54 - so let's go let's create the quiz all
34:56 - right so there's a question this one is
34:58 - with regards to the post-processing
34:59 - lecture there you go someone answered
35:02 - already okay so with regards to post
35:03 - processing should you add
35:05 - post-processing as soon as possible so
35:07 - yes no maybe can you repeat the question
35:10 - so let's see which is which
35:12 - all right go ahead and start voting and
35:14 - let's see what do all of you vote for
35:16 - this one let's see it's gonna be fun
35:19 - all right
35:25 - okay
35:27 - all right there you go so on this one
35:29 - got a nice mix yes no all right
35:33 - let us see what do all of you so this
35:35 - one is really hard so the electron post
35:37 - processing which actually yeah actually
35:39 - got the the thing over here so let's see
35:43 - the post-processing lecture
35:46 - and if I go put it on plane
35:50 - yeah that's kind of the issue with
35:52 - having an 11 hour is that I can't really
35:54 - click in there to see it I gotta
35:57 - go to the sign there you go adding some
36:00 - nice visual assets then adding a volume
36:03 - component and starting to add a bunch
36:04 - there you go look at that a lot of Bloom
36:06 - way too much Bloom got a nice little
36:09 - checklist to make sure that everything
36:10 - loads and playing around with empty
36:12 - analyzing and so on there you go I'll
36:15 - just trying to make the visuals actually
36:17 - look pretty good
36:19 - all right so there you go 10 more
36:21 - seconds let's see so it seems the
36:23 - majority thinks that it's no so is that
36:24 - the correct answer I don't know let's
36:26 - see
36:31 - all right
36:33 - there you go
36:34 - two seconds one second and let's end the
36:36 - quiz and which one is the correct answer
36:38 - and the answer is all of them are
36:40 - correct basically when it comes to
36:42 - post-processing usually you probably
36:44 - shouldn't do it like literally at the
36:46 - first thing so you should probably focus
36:48 - on the actual mechanics and the actual
36:49 - things so personally for me post
36:51 - processing is something that I'll leave
36:53 - later on in the process when I actually
36:55 - want to show the game to someone so when
36:57 - I want to when I want to promote it and
36:59 - so on however one thing that a lot of
37:02 - people have mentioned which I do think
37:03 - that it makes a lot of sense which is
37:05 - post processing can also help you with
37:06 - regards to motivation so if you're the
37:08 - kind of person who has trouble with
37:10 - motivation motivating yourself with
37:13 - actually continuing to work on the game
37:15 - if that's the the kind of mindset that
37:18 - you have then post-processing can
37:19 - actually help because by post processing
37:21 - originally making sure that your Visions
37:23 - look quite a bit better so if you focus
37:26 - on that in the very beginning that can
37:27 - actually help you stick with the project
37:29 - for the long run which in turn obviously
37:31 - helps you actually finish that project
37:32 - so for me personally the answer is no I
37:35 - don't really do it as soon as possible I
37:37 - take it for quite a bit later on in the
37:40 - depth process so I focus on the actual
37:41 - mechanics first but I can definitely see
37:44 - how for some people who have issues with
37:46 - motivation or that sort of thing then
37:47 - making the game actually look good I
37:50 - think it was actually Mark Brown when he
37:51 - was working on his prototype that he
37:53 - said that working on the visuals for
37:55 - quite a bit actually helped them stay
37:56 - motivated because the game actually
37:58 - looked good instead of just being a
38:00 - bunch of Cubes
38:01 - so basically the answer for this post
38:03 - processing as soon as possible that
38:05 - depends on you for me personally I'll
38:06 - leave it a bit later on but for a lot of
38:08 - people but for some other people maybe
38:10 - working on it in the beginning in order
38:12 - to make something look good that might
38:14 - help so yeah pretty much no wrong answer
38:16 - there so congratulations to all of them
38:18 - and Super Chat thank you
38:20 - create my first game just because of
38:23 - your awesome lessons it's announcing for
38:25 - wishlist Ah that's awesome so what is
38:27 - the name you have to say the name
38:30 - whenever you talk about your game so
38:32 - yeah that's awesome I hope it does well
38:34 - yeah and I hope it's also quite a bit uh
38:37 - further away in terms of
38:39 - the actual launch so I hope you left
38:41 - some time for Gathering wishlists
38:44 - so I think I think uh YouTube probably
38:48 - doesn't allow links but if you post the
38:50 - game name
38:51 - hopefully it's your job
38:53 - oh and by the way uh the game kitchen
38:55 - chaos is also available for free on
38:57 - Steam so if you want to play the final
38:59 - game if you want to have some fun go
39:00 - ahead and if you want go ahead and write
39:02 - a review so there are 10 reviews so now
39:04 - it shows up with the score so let's do
39:06 - it yeah
39:08 - all right it's okay
39:11 - so yeah so that was fun so all right so
39:15 - I hope that was a nice teachable moment
39:16 - about post-processing yes or no
39:19 - all right okay so let's go on to the
39:21 - next one all right
39:25 - name is yeah there's a Super Chat cute
39:27 - hey name is paratives won't be out in
39:30 - three months or something to implement
39:32 - multiplayer wow okay multiplayer that's
39:35 - a bit of a a tricky one
39:38 - I'm curious
39:40 - so where's the search bar why is steam
39:43 - so so tiny uh
39:48 - para types
39:50 - oh God Is It Horror yeah horror is not
39:53 - my thing sorry so yeah I will not be
39:55 - playing this but yeah I mean uh looking
39:58 - at the trailer it doesn't look good I
39:59 - mean horror that's one of the main
40:00 - things where you definitely need to make
40:03 - it look the part and it certainly
40:04 - doesn't work the part so congratulations
40:07 - okay so all of you if you want to
40:09 - support this developer go ahead and add
40:11 - to your wish list
40:13 - heading multiplayer yeah or in
40:15 - multiplayer that's a interesting one
40:17 - what was that one that was a mega hit
40:19 - there was a mega hit multiplayer game
40:21 - recently I don't remember the name but
40:23 - yeah it can definitely do well but yeah
40:26 - horror is not my thing so either way I
40:28 - definitely wish you the best of luck in
40:30 - your multiplayer Journey
40:32 - all right okay ah so let's see
40:35 - multiplayer is a tricky one free course
40:37 - on multiplayer yeah hopefully in a
40:39 - little bit I mean technically you can
40:41 - definitely uh use what you learn from
40:43 - making uh the kitchen chaos game you can
40:46 - definitely
40:47 - what I'm going to cover in the
40:49 - multiplayer course you could definitely
40:50 - use it to convert that and learn about
40:52 - how to make a horror game that would
40:54 - definitely work
40:55 - so yeah that's a great news once you
40:57 - learn how a tune Works applying it to a
40:59 - multitude of different game genres that
41:02 - always works
41:04 - all right okay so let's move on to the
41:07 - next lecture so this one like your next
41:09 - question so this one is going to be on
41:12 - the character controller
41:15 - all right so let's see for this one how
41:18 - many people get this question right only
41:20 - let's create the quiz and there you go
41:22 - okay so question this one is on lecture
41:24 - seven so that's an electron on the
41:26 - character controller should you make all
41:28 - of your variables public so a no yes or
41:32 - yes because I want to torture my
41:34 - programmer teammates
41:36 - so let's see how many of you get this
41:38 - one I would hope that it's most of you
41:40 - because this is something that I repeat
41:42 - over and over again so I hope that if
41:44 - your wreck and Learning Channel that
41:46 - hopefully this one is pretty much
41:48 - automatic
41:50 - so let's hope so let's see
41:52 - and there you go lots of people and yep
41:54 - someone over there stuck in the yep
41:56 - there you go yeah I'm not supposed to be
41:58 - staying there yeah probably not
42:00 - all right so let's see how many of you
42:04 - all right
42:08 - so this one is on the lecture on the
42:11 - character controller which is pretty
42:13 - much the first really median lecture on
42:15 - the course before this it's all setting
42:17 - up importing the assets and so on so
42:19 - this is the one that really gets hits
42:21 - the ground running on making some nice
42:24 - some nice codes and by the way if you're
42:27 - following the course definitely make
42:28 - sure to check this website because I've
42:29 - had the frequently asked questions to a
42:31 - bunch of these lectures so if you want
42:33 - to know some things chances are you can
42:36 - go up here and there's possibly a
42:37 - question that you have it's already been
42:39 - answered over here so for example if the
42:41 - code isn't running if you don't see the
42:43 - logs so possibly you didn't name the
42:45 - player exactly you didn't attach the
42:47 - object maybe update is not written
42:49 - exactly and so on if you only see a
42:50 - single message that probably is on the
42:52 - collapse button and so on so yeah lots
42:55 - of interesting questions here that a
42:57 - bunch of people have asked
42:58 - and yeah so I'm constantly updating this
43:01 - so if you're following the course
43:03 - definitely make sure you check out this
43:04 - nice companion page okay so that's it so
43:07 - let's go ahead and the quiz and see
43:10 - which one is the answer for this one
43:13 - and yep of course the answer is indeed a
43:15 - so no you should not make all of your
43:18 - variables bubbling so hopefully for all
43:20 - of you so there's a bunch of you said
43:22 - yes and yes because you want to torture
43:24 - a bunch of people so maybe but yeah the
43:27 - answer is indeed no they should not
43:29 - automatically be public in fact they
43:32 - should never be public so pretty much
43:34 - I don't think I generally don't think
43:36 - I've ever seen a use case for public
43:37 - well the exception would be on
43:39 - scriptable objects so for those I
43:41 - usually do make them public because on a
43:44 - scriptable object which I always deal as
43:46 - a read-only data container but yeah for
43:48 - regular variables yeah they should never
43:50 - be public there's no reason to be public
43:52 - why never is because I actually cover
43:54 - that in detail so
43:57 - if it's probably best to watch a
43:59 - dedicated video instead of me repeating
44:01 - the same thing over again but pretty
44:02 - much when you make it public you are
44:04 - enabling both read and write access from
44:06 - anywhere so if I can actually go here
44:10 - can I create
44:11 - something
44:14 - uh
44:16 - there you go I think I can
44:18 - all right
44:20 - so let's see if I can if I can do
44:22 - something like this
44:25 - okay so basically you shouldn't do it
44:28 - because you are enabling read and write
44:29 - access from anything so for example over
44:32 - here I got a public a float for the move
44:35 - speed and let's say this is the
44:36 - character script
44:38 - and then I've got another one so public
44:40 - class for the enemy
44:42 - so the enemy is doing something
44:44 - and over here the enemy has a reference
44:48 - to the character so the character so
44:49 - this is the player character and then on
44:53 - Fred void update
44:55 - for some reason the enemy decides that
44:57 - it wants to mess up the character so it
44:59 - can go into the character set the move
45:01 - speed equals zero and there you go this
45:03 - one is perfectly valid code so the enemy
45:05 - can suddenly modify the move speed on
45:07 - the character and everything breaks and
45:08 - your player can no longer move because
45:10 - you accidentally modified something when
45:12 - it should never be modified so basically
45:14 - by making it public you are enabling
45:16 - both read and write axes from any other
45:18 - class so if you have a thousand classes
45:20 - in your code base then that's a thousand
45:22 - points where you might be modifying this
45:24 - which might cause all kinds of breakage
45:26 - things in your game so you don't want
45:28 - that
45:29 - whereas if you make this private then
45:31 - you know for certain only the code
45:32 - inside this last can actually modify
45:34 - this field this one cannot access it
45:36 - because that one is private so this one
45:38 - no longer can cause that bug and
45:40 - suddenly break everything because the
45:41 - player has no movement
45:43 - so that's the super quick explanation of
45:46 - it but definitely go ahead and watch the
45:48 - dedicated video
45:49 - if you just follow this one room then
45:51 - that's one of the simplest things you
45:53 - can do that will massively increase the
45:55 - quality of a code so definitely make
45:57 - sure you do it
45:59 - okay all right
46:05 - talking about an absolute is quite wrong
46:07 - well I would love for someone to tell me
46:09 - generally I would agree there's uh most
46:12 - things in Game Dev they aren't really
46:13 - absolute so there are best practices and
46:15 - so on however when it comes to public
46:17 - variables I generally do not see there
46:20 - is a single possible positive use case
46:22 - there really isn't you are enabling both
46:25 - read and write access from anything it
46:27 - just really makes everything much worse
46:29 - it just it just makes the code much
46:31 - harder to read much harder to understand
46:33 - so yeah when it comes to public
46:34 - variables I have never seen a positive
46:37 - use case so yeah for this one I would
46:39 - definitely use the absolutes definitely
46:41 - never ever use it that's pretty much it
46:44 - all right
46:45 - not get bruise on your hand by
46:48 - constantly forcing the water bottle to
46:50 - close I mean this one is pretty soft so
46:51 - yeah
46:52 - or I guess maybe my head is a bit too
46:55 - hard that's maybe it yeah but is there a
46:57 - video on lecture it covers this
46:58 - integrated chat voting scene I did make
47:01 - some cover some there's some tutorial
47:03 - links down here at the bottom of this
47:05 - page but basically uh it's just really
47:07 - working with the YouTube API so the
47:09 - YouTube API has a way to get the live
47:11 - chat comments so that's what it does I'm
47:13 - doing an HTTP request from inside Unity
47:16 - so there's a dedicated tutorial here so
47:18 - I do that in order to ask YouTube to get
47:20 - me the in live chat comments then I use
47:22 - that to spawn some characters and show
47:24 - some nice chat bubbles so that's pretty
47:26 - much it pretty soon hey thanks for being
47:28 - here on live that's nice yeah these live
47:31 - streams are are a bit random So yeah
47:33 - thank you all for
47:34 - for being here all right okay
47:37 - so let's go on to the next question so
47:40 - this one's gonna be on lecture eight so
47:43 - let's create the quiz
47:45 - and let's see this question
47:50 - a b and c now that I'm noticing yeah I
47:53 - think all the questions only have ABC I
47:55 - don't think I include any anyways okay
47:57 - all right so let's get once again thanks
47:59 - for the Super Chat and there's a cute
48:01 - Super Chat all right hey clippy that's
48:04 - nice I miss clippy it was fun thanks for
48:07 - being awesome hey thanks for being here
48:08 - uh that's nice all right so for the next
48:12 - question so let's create the next
48:13 - question okay so this one is going to be
48:16 - on lecture eight so that is the lecture
48:18 - on the character Visual and rotation
48:20 - so in this lecture what is the
48:22 - difference between lerp and slurp so his
48:24 - difference that slurp sounds bad which I
48:27 - guess maybe a little bit uh is it that
48:29 - LARP works with vectors and smaller
48:31 - ports and directions or layer ports with
48:33 - directions and similar ports with
48:35 - vectors by saying all this is a bit
48:38 - tricky
48:40 - all right so go ahead and vote
48:43 - and let's see oh boy there's seems to be
48:46 - a lot of mixed feelings about this one
48:48 - okay so let's see
48:50 - how many of you get this right
48:52 - this is one of those things that is
48:54 - actually super useful and it's also
48:57 - something that I have a dedicated video
48:59 - on well sort of dedicated it's actually
49:01 - a short video because it's something
49:03 - super simple
49:04 - but yeah if you want to learn about lerp
49:07 - or slurp which both work pretty much the
49:09 - same way definitely go ahead and watch
49:11 - this video so let's see how many of you
49:13 - get this right
49:15 - okay so it seems the nice majority is
49:17 - going with b and a bunch of people think
49:19 - that slurp sounds bad which I don't
49:21 - think I can disagree with okay and let's
49:25 - see so vectors or directions so which
49:27 - one works with which
49:29 - so let us see
49:31 - all right
49:33 - our vectors directions that depends on
49:35 - each person I guess for directions what
49:37 - I mean is kind of like a vector always
49:39 - with a magnitude of one whereas with
49:42 - Vector I mean a vector that can have any
49:44 - magnitude so maybe it's a tiny Vector
49:46 - maybe it's super long whereas the
49:48 - direction that one always has the same
49:49 - thing and just rotates points at
49:51 - different positions so that's kind of
49:53 - what I mean but yeah technically not
49:55 - possibly not the correct technical term
49:57 - but yeah I'm not a mathematician so yeah
49:59 - I don't know
50:01 - turn on for slurp well I covered LARP
50:03 - over here and slurp works pretty much
50:06 - exactly the same way except for one tiny
50:09 - difference which is this difference so
50:11 - is it vectors or is directions all right
50:13 - so let's go ahead and end the quiz
50:16 - and see which one is it
50:19 - and just make sure that I don't make the
50:21 - mistake myself alright so let's end the
50:24 - quiz and there you go yep the answer is
50:26 - over here indeed being solar works with
50:29 - vectors whereas slurp works with
50:30 - directions now the important thing with
50:33 - this one is for example if you make a
50:35 - interpolation between a vector pointing
50:37 - right and then a vector pointing left if
50:39 - you do that and you use slurp then
50:40 - basically it's going to rotate because
50:42 - it's going to work with directions
50:43 - whereas if you use it with alert then
50:46 - basically this Vector is going to shrink
50:48 - and then pretty much do a 180 and stick
50:50 - around there so that might sound a bit
50:52 - confusing so maybe this but yeah pretty
50:55 - much on
50:57 - if I can I make some quick testing code
51:00 - so if I write this testing just you show
51:04 - you in action let me just quickly
51:07 - make this
51:09 - so testing
51:13 - like void update Motel transform
51:18 - dot forward
51:20 - okay so let's do over here so with a
51:22 - nice testing script
51:25 - so basically transform that forward
51:27 - let's do a a math F dot slurp
51:31 - slurp what's up nothing at that I want
51:34 - the vector three which by the way
51:35 - there's Alert in both meth F and that
51:38 - and let's go into new Vector three
51:41 - four let's go on left so minus one
51:44 - zero zero
51:47 - and then find that Delta time
51:50 - okay transform Dot forward equals this
51:53 - okay so let's do a basic lerp and let's
51:56 - see what this does and over here let me
51:58 - just create an object
52:00 - put the testing
52:02 - and just let me
52:05 - okay actually I probably should have
52:07 - prepared these testing scenes
52:09 - beforehand but
52:15 - uh ah crap it already has
52:20 - okay
52:22 - yeah I'm trying to
52:24 - figure this out trying to make this
52:27 - trying to show the
52:30 - the thing in action
52:35 - uh right yeah I definitely should
52:39 - okay all right so let's see
52:43 - [Music]
52:47 - okay yeah pretty much so let me just
52:50 - rotate this
52:52 - okay something like this so let's see
52:54 - the okay so here is the demo that I'm
52:56 - showing
52:57 - so basically what matters over there the
52:59 - blue arrow So currently this one is
53:01 - using slurp so let's see what this one
53:04 - does so if I hit on play look at that
53:06 - blue arrow and let's see what it does
53:07 - and there you go it rotates around like
53:10 - that so look what it does
53:13 - next one like this I'm not sure if it's
53:15 - going to but let's see now let's swap it
53:19 - out for a lerp and let's see with LARP
53:21 - what this one does
53:23 - and if I go ahead and I hit on plane
53:28 - foreign
53:33 - okay
53:37 - oh is it not moving yeah I should
53:39 - probably add a log so we can see
53:42 - transform
53:44 - dot forward
53:49 - oh right because yeah so actually with
53:52 - this uh
53:54 - yeah with this demo actually work isn't
53:57 - going to work because transformer.4 is
54:00 - always going to be in normalized value
54:01 - so so that's funny so for the thing that
54:04 - I wanted to test doesn't actually work
54:05 - so let's do a vector 3 for the test
54:08 - vector
54:09 - and over here on what's instead use the
54:11 - test vector
54:12 - and print it out okay so I can't really
54:16 - see it visually because yeah you can
54:19 - upload before us back yeah exactly I
54:20 - forgot about that because it normalizes
54:23 - automatically
54:24 - So based on like this we should be able
54:26 - to see so there you go so this is the
54:28 - alert which that one should probably
54:30 - start off on you
54:31 - one zero zero
54:34 - okay so let's see what this does using
54:37 - lerp
54:39 - slurp always looks better than my
54:40 - experience yeah pretty much if you're
54:42 - handling rotations then lyric won't
54:44 - probably always look better so slurp
54:46 - sorry okay so this one is using lerp and
54:49 - basically the starting Vector is one
54:51 - zero so a vector point to right and look
54:53 - how this the vector basically becomes
54:55 - shorter and shorter until it gets into
54:57 - zero and then flips around to the other
54:59 - end and then becomes so basically we can
55:01 - shorter and then goes out whereas if you
55:03 - use slurp this one actually use
55:06 - directions instead of using a vector
55:09 - so if we go into this one let's see
55:12 - instead of becoming shortened let's see
55:13 - what it actually does
55:15 - so let's look at the vectors
55:17 - and there you go so it starts off in one
55:19 - and instead of becoming shortened this
55:20 - one actually rotates so this one goes
55:22 - down on the set so it goes down like
55:23 - this and rotates around instead of
55:25 - becoming shorter and pointing the other
55:27 - way so basically that's pretty much the
55:28 - difference so alert works with vectors
55:31 - so it works with multiple magnitudes
55:33 - whereas slower ports with Direction so
55:35 - if you're handling rotations you should
55:37 - probably stick with using slurp since
55:39 - that one is going to rotate around even
55:40 - when you do 180 degrees whereas with
55:42 - more the character would suddenly flip
55:44 - around
55:45 - so that's pretty much the answer okay so
55:47 - that was a bit a bit tricky trying to do
55:50 - a demo live but hopefully for those of
55:53 - you who didn't know about the
55:55 - differences between slurp and lerp
55:57 - hopefully that was educational and
55:59 - thanks again clipping thank you
56:01 - all right okay so let's go on to the
56:04 - next question so where is it let's go
56:07 - into this one so let's create the quiz
56:11 - and with this one
56:14 - and this one and this one
56:18 - okay all right so let's create a brand
56:21 - new question okay so this one is on
56:24 - lecture nine so this is the lecture on
56:26 - animations so if an animation has a
56:28 - property in yellow saying missing what
56:30 - exactly is the problem so is the problem
56:32 - that there is no child object with that
56:34 - exact name is it that the animation file
56:36 - is corrupted or was the animation not
56:38 - added to the animator State machine
56:40 - so now let me as you try to answer them
56:43 - let me quickly
56:44 - try to showcase the problem in action
56:46 - and I've got a visitor right now
56:49 - okay so let me just
56:53 - IDK that I
56:56 - alright so this is what I'm what I'm
56:58 - talking about there that one is in
57:00 - yellow so what does that mean
57:02 - go ahead and post your questions so
57:05 - there you go what does that one in
57:06 - yellow mean
57:09 - putting D for doggo
57:12 - yeah
57:16 - it's almost it's almost dinner time so
57:18 - that's why he's
57:20 - starting to get stressed
57:23 - all right what's his her name his and
57:26 - it's Tico and sister Tekken she's over
57:31 - there sleeping so yeah
57:32 - she usually stays sleeping and he's the
57:34 - one that that comes out
57:37 - all right
57:38 - okay so let's see which one is which
57:41 - multiplier Coast do you know if it's
57:43 - going to be Photon engine nope it's
57:45 - going to be using netcode for game
57:46 - objects so that's unity's uh
57:50 - the built-in official multiplayer
57:52 - solution so that's pretty much my
57:54 - digging
57:57 - from Japan
58:01 - all right okay
58:03 - all right okay so let's see and see
58:07 - which one is the answer so the answer as
58:09 - to why that one is in yellow saying
58:10 - missing
58:11 - so let's end the quiz and see which one
58:14 - is the correct answer and drum roll and
58:16 - there you go the answer is indeed over
58:18 - here a so the answer is there's no child
58:20 - object with that exact name
58:23 - should I have the same name in fact yes
58:24 - correct yes uh yeah basically when this
58:27 - happens is because there's no sound of
58:29 - this object named exactly head this is
58:32 - one of the annoying things about
58:33 - animations is that it's actually based
58:35 - on strings so it's all based on names so
58:38 - most of you probably already know that I
58:40 - hate strings for identifying things and
58:42 - basically the reason why this one is
58:43 - saying missing is because I went ahead
58:45 - and I modified this one so I renamed
58:47 - this one to head 2 so now if I play the
58:49 - animation that one isn't actually going
58:50 - to play the animation because it doesn't
58:52 - have any object named exactly head so
58:55 - the solution to this is either go up
58:57 - here and you can click you can click
58:59 - once you select and then wait a bit and
59:01 - then click again and you can rename the
59:02 - object so if I go over here and I rename
59:05 - this property to head 2 to match the one
59:07 - over there there you go now it's no
59:08 - longer in yellow so now it does fine now
59:10 - if I move there you go it does oh boy
59:13 - this is really
59:15 - it's really why is this so
59:18 - yeah I don't know it's very strange uh
59:20 - yeah so like this there you go the head
59:22 - is indeed moving up whereas if I put it
59:25 - back into that one
59:27 - where it says missing now I move around
59:28 - now the head does not move so this is
59:31 - always based on strings it's always
59:32 - based on the exact names that is one
59:34 - annoying thing so if you ever have this
59:36 - problem you just have to make sure to
59:38 - rename so that it matches exactly as the
59:41 - child was named when the animation was
59:43 - recorded So if you do that then you have
59:45 - the animation plays correctly
59:48 - all right
59:50 - okay so that was a fun one so
59:54 - most of you apparently already knew that
59:55 - so yeah it's not completely free yep it
59:57 - is netcode itself is free then you've
59:59 - got the very easy GS tools those are
60:02 - paid for but yep netcode itself is
60:04 - indeed free
60:08 - their idea work being stolen copied I
60:11 - would say if you're talking about game
60:13 - ideas everybody has a million game idea
60:16 - so definitely definitely do not
60:19 - definitely don't worry about that about
60:21 - people stealing your game ideas
60:23 - everybody has ideas ideas are diamond
60:25 - doesn't what really matters is execution
60:27 - so definitely don't worry definitely
60:29 - share your ideas with people talk about
60:30 - it and so on
60:32 - if you put head under body yeah exactly
60:35 - uh oh boy I'm moving the wrong window uh
60:38 - where's my other one if we have way too
60:40 - many windows open so it's quite tricky
60:41 - yeah if over here this one is a prefab
60:44 - but if I try moving can I try moving
60:47 - inside a preface yeah it breaks the
60:49 - whole thing
60:51 - can I duplicate this one and go into
60:54 - where's my prefab unpack completely yeah
60:57 - and now if I go in here
60:59 - and let's rename this one or let's
61:01 - remaining this one so put it on head if
61:03 - now I put the head inside the body
61:06 - and there you go now that one's also
61:07 - missing because yep like CPU mentioned
61:09 - it has to be the correct pass so this
61:11 - one is missing this one actually has the
61:12 - correct name but there's no direct child
61:14 - of this object named head that one is a
61:17 - child of the other one so if I were to
61:18 - make this one a channel that one there
61:20 - you go that does fix
61:21 - all right okay
61:24 - so that was a fun question
61:26 - all right now let's see what else okay
61:30 - so it was the electron animation so
61:32 - that's actually pretty fun I actually
61:33 - made the animations on this game myself
61:35 - so I'm correct I'm talking about the the
61:37 - kitchen counts so they're pretty pretty
61:39 - happy with how those came out these are
61:41 - simple animations but they worked pretty
61:43 - well
61:44 - all right so let's see another question
61:46 - this one is a quick and simple one so
61:49 - let's put it
61:51 - let's put it just 30 seconds because
61:52 - it's the super simple one so let's go on
61:55 - to the next question can I move my
61:56 - character by chat no it goes
61:57 - automatically it goes randomly and then
62:00 - as you vote it goes there
62:03 - specs of the equipment you choose let me
62:04 - just post the quiz uh specs well my GPU
62:08 - is like a 30 90 I think my monitors are
62:12 - like 10 years old my keyboard actually
62:15 - just bought it recently because my other
62:17 - one actually died
62:19 - so yeah
62:21 - my CPU I have no idea I built it like
62:24 - two years ago so my specs aren't
62:25 - anything I mean I guess my GPU is the
62:27 - only thing uh 3090 is definitely
62:29 - overkill for a lot of people but since I
62:31 - have to do a lot of video rendering for
62:33 - me it's really helpful to be able to
62:35 - render a video and not have to wait
62:36 - hours on end
62:38 - I mean even with that rendering the the
62:41 - course which is a 10 hour video
62:42 - rendering that one took quite a long
62:45 - time took like three hours
62:47 - which is actually pretty fast uh three
62:49 - hours to render a 10 hour video but then
62:51 - uploading that's the main thing that
62:53 - took quite a long time
62:55 - all right
62:56 - specs do you think a person needs to be
62:57 - able to start making game the answer is
62:59 - anything literally whatever you have
63:00 - right now as long as it's a computer
63:02 - because ENT doesn't run on mobile as
63:05 - long as it's a computer then yep all
63:08 - right so yeah this was a a simple
63:10 - question can you use an orthograph
63:11 - camera in a 3D game and the answer is
63:13 - yep you can
63:15 - so let me end the quiz and the answer is
63:17 - a yep you can use an orthographic camera
63:20 - even in a 3D game so there you go
63:22 - congrats to all of you tunic using
63:24 - orthography camera yeah probably
63:27 - it's a definitely a gorgeous game
63:29 - technique that was that was awesome I
63:31 - think for the course yeah that's great
63:32 - if you're gonna run the potato you're
63:34 - going yeah
63:36 - minimap tutorial yep that one also use a
63:38 - yeah but basically if some of you don't
63:40 - know what exactly is an orthographic
63:42 - camera so here is my demo scene so this
63:45 - one is for the main menu for kitchen
63:47 - chaos and if I select the camera where's
63:50 - my camera there you go my main camera
63:51 - and over here it set as perspective so
63:53 - this is like a it's what you usually
63:55 - think about when you think of a 3D
63:57 - camera but you can put it as
63:59 - orthographic and basically orthographic
64:01 - means that it doesn't I don't know the
64:03 - technical concern doesn't go out to the
64:05 - sides so pretty much any object in any
64:07 - position doesn't get distorted it always
64:09 - gets it always looks exactly the same so
64:11 - over here the characters they all look
64:12 - perfectly the same even though they are
64:14 - at different distances whereas with a
64:16 - prospective camera this one up front is
64:18 - much bigger and the ones on front are
64:20 - more squished I don't know the technical
64:23 - terms that's pretty much it but yeah so
64:25 - yeah even with 3D meshes you can still
64:27 - use a orthograph camera or even with two
64:30 - uh 2D Sprites which by the way over the
64:32 - characters over here these are all
64:34 - actual flat these Sprites so I can
64:37 - actually show the the if I can show
64:41 - here is the scene view that is running
64:43 - the game right now
64:45 - and if I go over there there you go look
64:48 - at that all of the characters they are
64:49 - all flat Sprites look at that they're on
64:52 - flat pointing straight at the camera so
64:54 - yeah this is a 3D scene so the
64:56 - characters are moving on the z-axis and
64:58 - yep there you go they are flat
65:00 - characters with a perspective camera
65:02 - which I can zoom in and zoom out and for
65:04 - the zoom in method this one is modifying
65:06 - the field of view so like this lower
65:08 - field of view and back out and a wider
65:10 - field of view so you can see a bit of uh
65:12 - on the corners there becomes a bit more
65:15 - like that
65:17 - right so that was another fun one so we
65:20 - put just this one on the side like that
65:22 - so there you go you can definitely use
65:24 - orthographic cameras in 3D games that
65:26 - does work and can definitely be good all
65:28 - right
65:30 - can you add subtitles yeah sorry but
65:33 - getting subtitles for multiple languages
65:35 - for the 10 hour course that would be
65:37 - quite tricky to do so yeah ideally I'd
65:41 - love to but yeah that would be quite
65:43 - tricky
65:50 - I mean even adding just in Portuguese
65:52 - the amount of work that it would take to
65:54 - translate in 11 hours that would be
65:57 - quite tricky so yeah
66:00 - how you learned unity and programming
66:01 - well back when I started learning back
66:03 - in 2012 YouTube tutorials weren't really
66:06 - a thing so I learned by trial and error
66:08 - just try to build something then it
66:10 - doesn't work it breaks so then go on
66:12 - Google and find some mysterious forums
66:13 - talking about things so that's pretty
66:16 - much it so back in my day I learned
66:19 - pretty much based on trial and error
66:21 - trying to do something doesn't work
66:23 - finding an error I mean the good news
66:25 - that Unity uses c-sharp and c-sharp is
66:27 - widely used so even back then so I
66:30 - couldn't find Unity specific things but
66:32 - I could definitely find C sharp related
66:33 - things so yeah that's pretty much how I
66:36 - learned so nowadays all of you are very
66:38 - lucky that you have lots of tutorials to
66:40 - teach you guided step by step yeah
66:42 - basically the videos that I make
66:44 - nowadays are the videos that I wish I
66:45 - had when I got certain which was yeah 10
66:48 - years ago
66:50 - yeah over 10 years ago because I started
66:52 - using Unity it was in December of 2012.
66:54 - so we are now in 23 so yep it's been
66:57 - over 10 years since I've been using
66:59 - Unity so yeah definitely quite a lot all
67:02 - right
67:02 - why didn't you use an async method to
67:05 - load the scene just because the scene is
67:07 - is super quick so in order to unload the
67:10 - loading scene the loading scene is super
67:12 - small so yeah I'm loading that one
67:14 - without async doesn't really matter so
67:16 - yeah if you want to do something more
67:18 - complex then yeah definitely use the
67:20 - async method but for simple use cases
67:21 - the regular non-async method that works
67:25 - great
67:26 - only multiplayer course be phone server
67:28 - authoritative and nope I mean the goal
67:31 - of this game it's really a a casual
67:34 - Co-op game so for that one I'm probably
67:36 - going to keep things simple and just
67:38 - stick with using uh client authoritative
67:40 - because there's no it's a co-op game so
67:43 - there's pretty much no issue with
67:45 - cheating but yeah that is one topic that
67:47 - I very much would like to cover in a
67:49 - feature dedicated tutorial
67:51 - all right okay so that's fun so let's go
67:54 - on to the next lecture
67:56 - uh all right so let's go with this one
68:00 - so let's Create a quiz
68:02 - and this one is a big one
68:06 - so let's see well let's see if this one
68:09 - actually fits the UI I hope so otherwise
68:11 - it's going to be tricky
68:12 - so let's go create the quiz for the next
68:15 - question so there you go this one is on
68:16 - lecture 12. so there is one over here on
68:19 - collision detection
68:21 - so the question is what is the
68:23 - difference between overlap box and
68:24 - boxcast
68:26 - so is it a overnight box sets if there's
68:28 - a collision on the target area and
68:30 - boxcasts if there's a collision anywhere
68:32 - between two points or is it being
68:35 - overlapbox the CD boxcast is reading or
68:38 - is it seeing over on that box is better
68:40 - suited for characters and boxcast for
68:42 - objects so go ahead and post your votes
68:44 - in chat
68:45 - alright so let's see so this one is a
68:48 - slightly tricky one I've seen a bunch of
68:51 - comments I've been answering comments
68:52 - for the course and yeah a bunch of
68:54 - people do have a question similar to
68:56 - this so let's see
69:00 - and let me prepare a simple testing
69:03 - scene
69:06 - where's my oh it's over here on this
69:08 - side okay
69:10 - all right so let me just
69:14 - okay
69:19 - all right so go ahead and vote I'm just
69:21 - preparing a simple testing scene
69:26 - okay
69:30 - all right so on Chats on vote and look
69:33 - at that seems people are convinced that
69:34 - it's a so is that correct and some
69:36 - people think that overlap box is 2D
69:38 - boxcast is 3D
69:40 - okay so let's see so this is the on the
69:43 - Collision detection and once again the
69:45 - FAQ
69:46 - actually the FAQ is kind of answering
69:48 - the question here so
69:50 - I guess that's a good thing about the
69:52 - FAQ but yeah kind of screws up the the
69:54 - quiz here but anyways go ahead and vote
69:57 - the whole point is knowledge it's not
69:59 - really it's not really about and look at
70:01 - that still tons of people getting 100 so
70:04 - getting all the questions right so on
70:06 - that's awesome congrats all right so
70:08 - let's go ahead and end this question and
70:10 - let's see which one is the answer
70:14 - and indeed the correct answer if there
70:17 - you go the correct answer is indeed a
70:19 - which is overlap box this if there's a
70:21 - collision just on the target area
70:22 - whereas the box has tests if there's a
70:25 - collision anywhere between the two
70:27 - points so yep that is the difference
70:28 - between those two
70:30 - so let me pick up a simple testing scene
70:32 - so here I've got a testing scene so
70:34 - let's say this is a wall and this one
70:36 - actually has a leather and let's say
70:38 - you've got a character over here and the
70:40 - character wants to move to this position
70:41 - so if you do if the character is here
70:43 - and you do an overlap box over here on
70:46 - this position then two on returned
70:47 - phones because it won't find any
70:49 - colliders because there are no colliders
70:50 - directly on this position whereas if you
70:52 - use a boxcast basically what the boxes
70:54 - does is it moves a virtual box or a
70:56 - virtual shape depends if it's a box has
70:59 - sphere cast and so on if it's a box gas
71:01 - then basically the physics system will
71:03 - move a virtual box in the virtual
71:05 - physics space and it will move from A to
71:07 - B and in that movement it won't find
71:09 - anything that collides within between
71:11 - the points A and B so in this case if
71:13 - you do an overlap box it won't just as
71:15 - this position and return false but if
71:17 - you were to do a box cast it would start
71:19 - from here and move a virtual box onto
71:21 - this direction and it would find this
71:23 - wall in the middle so that would really
71:24 - turn true because it would indeed find
71:26 - something
71:27 - so that is the difference between those
71:29 - two if you had a big distance and you
71:32 - want to make sure like for example for a
71:33 - a bullet if you want to fire a bullet
71:36 - you don't want to just test on point a
71:38 - and point B you want to test if there's
71:40 - a Wong or a character or anything in
71:42 - between point a and point B because the
71:44 - bullet is probably going to move a ton
71:45 - of distance between one frame and the
71:47 - other one so for a bullet you really
71:49 - want to do a cast instead of just an
71:50 - overlap because you want to test if
71:52 - there's anything in between the two
71:53 - points
71:55 - so that is the difference between those
71:56 - two and definitely knowing those
71:58 - differences are very important and once
72:00 - again it's over here on the FAQ on the
72:02 - website so if you're following the
72:03 - course definitely make sure you check
72:05 - the website page okay right
72:09 - recommend paying your model or musician
72:11 - or attempt to find somebody for free I
72:13 - mean I guess depends on what is your
72:14 - goal if you're trying to make games
72:16 - commercially then yeah you should
72:18 - definitely
72:19 - pay for for the essence but if you're
72:21 - doing it just for fun just as a hobby
72:23 - then yeah definitely find someone who
72:26 - also wants to
72:27 - we also want to try out their improving
72:30 - their modeling skills and build the game
72:31 - together with no goal of profit so
72:33 - pretty much depends on your goals both
72:35 - can definitely work my custom character
72:37 - yep let me just check this out so let me
72:40 - refresh the page which actually takes a
72:42 - little bit but okay so let's see
72:46 - I can't speak of any English very
72:48 - because I'm from Egypt but I can
72:50 - understand some words alright that's
72:51 - awesome I mean
72:53 - we always uh it's always a learning
72:55 - process for me I learned English by
72:58 - watching Cartoon Network as a kid that's
73:00 - pretty much how I learned so yeah
73:03 - so yeah if you're here if you can
73:05 - understand a few things and yep over
73:07 - time you will definitely learn more and
73:09 - more so yeah just keep exposing yourself
73:11 - to English things
73:13 - yeah you will eventually learn that's
73:15 - how I learned so yeah
73:16 - uh okay so I'm just checking the the
73:20 - validation
73:22 - thing trying to see
73:25 - yeah I really need to update this code
73:27 - because it's quite a bit slow
73:32 - uh
73:36 - I'm just looking at things
73:40 - uh so far
73:43 - okay there's a bunch of
73:45 - okay so let me validate these new
73:48 - characters
73:50 - okay so I'm validating a bunch of them
73:55 - by the way there are some that uh some
73:58 - people have included custom characters
73:59 - but they did not link their YouTube
74:02 - account so some of these won't show up
74:04 - but the others should let me just
74:06 - update the character customization
74:10 - so that should be
74:12 - updating now I hope there you go there's
74:15 - a nice new custom character so there you
74:17 - go if you just joined recently so you
74:19 - can draw on your own character make your
74:21 - own character and let me just where's my
74:23 - chat what's my chat
74:25 - there you go like that you can follow
74:27 - the tutorial in order to customize it
74:30 - and so on
74:31 - there you go another nice custom
74:33 - character Never Their CPU with a nice
74:35 - character anyone else there's me with a
74:38 - nice character and there you go Timbo
74:40 - Jones with nice Rayman and anyone else
74:43 - there was a Spider-Man a while ago no I
74:45 - guess no more all right okay
74:48 - okay
74:50 - how'd you manage to pay the bills while
74:51 - making games you mentioned never worth
74:53 - nine to five well I mean first of all it
74:55 - helps that I live in Portugal where
74:57 - there's a relative low cost of living so
75:00 - when I started I could make a living on
75:03 - something like six or seven hundred
75:05 - bucks
75:06 - so by the time that I was also well the
75:09 - more important thing is I was living
75:11 - with my parents until I made enough
75:13 - money with my games to move out so
75:14 - that's the first thing so I was making
75:17 - games for there you go Spider-Man's back
75:19 - uh yeah so I was making uh flash games
75:22 - for about five years and I was still
75:24 - living with my parents because that
75:25 - couldn't pay enough but yeah by the end
75:27 - I was already making about five or six
75:30 - hundred bucks a month and then I went on
75:32 - to see him and that started actually
75:33 - making some decent money so yeah pretty
75:36 - much the answer is low cost of living
75:37 - plus living with parents plus having a
75:41 - nice ramp up of experience so for about
75:44 - five years that I was making games I
75:46 - wasn't really making enough
75:47 - so that's pretty much it
75:50 - Super Chat thank you do you have any
75:52 - predictions on when multiplayer won't
75:54 - come out I I'm hoping by the end of this
75:57 - month but honestly I don't know I mean I
76:01 - I've done a bunch of research I've done
76:04 - a little bit of the Prototype but yeah
76:06 - they're still still a lot of work to do
76:08 - I still got to research a lot more I
76:10 - still gotta finish the Prototype then I
76:12 - got it right on the lectures and I gotta
76:13 - record them then I gotta edit them and
76:15 - then finally publish them so I'm hoping
76:18 - I can do all of that within this month
76:20 - so
76:21 - maybe on the last week of this month or
76:23 - maybe the first or second week of March
76:26 - so I don't know but yeah hopefully
76:28 - hopefully it won't be too long hopefully
76:34 - all right great
76:36 - and there we go
76:37 - uh
76:40 - all right okay so let's go on to the
76:43 - next question so where was I
76:49 - okay so let's go with this one so this
76:51 - is a fun one uh yeah it's almost dinner
76:56 - time so I'm going to have to close in a
77:00 - little bit okay bye
77:03 - okay so let's just
77:06 - go into the next one
77:10 - all right so there you go brand new
77:12 - question so this one is on lecture 15.
77:16 - so let's see lecture 15 that is the one
77:18 - on the selected count original any
77:20 - Singleton okay
77:22 - so what is the cause of the flickering
77:24 - bug and let me actually show that book
77:28 - that I mean
77:29 - uh
77:31 - oh boy I need that uh is it two objects
77:34 - don't worry about the time I'm going to
77:36 - yeah because I actually need to
77:39 - uh let me just make a quick
77:42 - a quick testing scene yeah because I
77:44 - probably should have prepared the
77:45 - testing scenes beforehand
77:49 - uh
77:51 - just need to pick up something
77:59 - okay oh
78:04 - okay
78:18 - uh trying to
78:25 - oh boy it didn't yeah I didn't plan this
78:29 - this demo ahead of time
78:32 - so
78:35 - me
78:36 - like this like this
78:39 - just select a different material
78:42 - anything
78:45 - [Music]
78:46 - duh boy
78:48 - oh actually
78:50 - oh because I remember that I saw this a
78:52 - little bit uh yeah sorry for the a bit
78:56 - of chaos right now I'm
78:59 - yeah because I did
79:03 - now I can't find it
79:05 - uh where's my where's my
79:09 - I'm trying to find something and I can't
79:11 - find it
79:12 - there you go that's the one
79:15 - there you go okay so that's the that's
79:17 - the bug that I want to show Okay so
79:19 - let's go in here so there you go
79:22 - look at this look at this flick ring so
79:25 - this is what I mean so what is the cause
79:27 - of this flickering bug where the texture
79:30 - is smiggling back and forth
79:31 - so is it that two objects are on the
79:33 - mathematically exact position is the GPU
79:35 - broken or is it a physics solution so
79:37 - there you go this is debug so if all of
79:39 - you if some of you didn't know what I
79:41 - mean by that go ahead and vote
79:44 - and let me look at chat yeah this one is
79:46 - a bit tricky
79:49 - and
79:51 - oh boy there's even a fully ring over
79:53 - here yeah someone over there does have
79:55 - the the right answer there you go oh boy
79:59 - let me end this because this flickering
80:00 - is driving me crazy and yep the answer
80:02 - is indeed a it is two objects are on the
80:05 - mathematically exact position or like
80:08 - these people mention more the more
80:10 - technical term is Z fighting so it's
80:13 - more in the Z buffer so basically since
80:15 - this quad is literally on position
80:17 - where's the position
80:19 - there you go it's literally on zero just
80:21 - like the floor object these two are on
80:24 - the exact same thing so this is a very
80:26 - nasty visual issue so if you have this
80:28 - one solution is super simple literally
80:29 - just put this a tiny bit off there you
80:32 - go just like this just by moving it by
80:34 - 0.01 and now no longer got the problem
80:36 - so Yep this is called Z fighting because
80:38 - both are on the exact same depth so that
80:41 - is what makes it quite annoying so if
80:43 - you have that now you know just make
80:45 - sure that one of the objects is not on
80:47 - the exact perfect position and
80:49 - everything will be nice and fixed all
80:51 - right okay so that was a bit a bit
80:54 - tricky to set up the demo I guess next
80:56 - time I gotta prepare demos ahead of time
81:00 - okay
81:03 - do you have a Discord Channel I don't
81:05 - but uh CPU over here has a nice Discord
81:09 - channel so if you want to it's called
81:10 - United programming
81:13 - so just found it find it in Discord so
81:16 - if you want Discord go ahead on there
81:18 - basically I tried having a Discord and
81:20 - didn't work because I'm already insanely
81:22 - busy trying to answer all the comments
81:24 - course questions emails all those things
81:26 - it is always super difficult to keep up
81:28 - so I really couldn't keep up with one
81:30 - more thing especially since Discord is
81:32 - real time so that is why I couldn't do
81:35 - it alright so
81:37 - thank you so much for the Super Chat
81:40 - and got another one
81:42 - did not get the YouTube notification
81:44 - arrive late oh well this one's going to
81:47 - be saved and this one is hopefully a bit
81:49 - educational so hopefully for people who
81:51 - are catching this after a while so
81:53 - hopefully that's nice yeah stream
81:55 - announcements post on Discord hope you
81:57 - have a great time thank you uh there is
81:59 - an email on the website so if you log in
82:01 - if you go into your user page you can
82:04 - sign up to be notified and yeah it won't
82:07 - send that
82:10 - okay all right so let me do a bunch more
82:13 - questions because it's already 6 30 so I
82:15 - gotta stop in a little bit
82:18 - okay so let's see this one this one is a
82:20 - a fun one so
82:22 - let me copy the options
82:25 - that one and that one and down
82:29 - all right so there you go another
82:30 - question this one is related to lecture
82:33 - 18 so that is an electron player pickup
82:35 - and c-sharp interface so the question
82:37 - how many interfaces and base classes can
82:40 - a class implement or extend so is it a
82:43 - multiple interfaces but only one base
82:45 - less or is it being a multiple base less
82:48 - but only one interface or is it c as
82:50 - many as you want so if you got basses
82:52 - and interfaces how many can you
82:54 - implement slash extend
82:56 - so what team
82:58 - and thank you so much talks for the
82:59 - Super Chat thank you another one cute oh
83:02 - boy there's even more cue thank you so
83:04 - much sorry if I I miss them yeah I'm
83:06 - trying to keep up with everything uh
83:08 - subhari yeah that's a nice name thank
83:11 - you for everything you do for asking you
83:12 - hey thank you for the Super Chat and
83:13 - thanks for being here yeah I mean these
83:16 - live streams really it's a two-way thing
83:18 - so it only works if I'm here and if all
83:20 - of you are here watching so thank you
83:22 - all so much for being here on this
83:23 - random
83:24 - is it using I don't even know what day
83:26 - it is it is using right yeah I think so
83:29 - uh yeah so so thank you all for being
83:31 - here
83:35 - when I make every correct answer it's
83:37 - not exactly I think I did try to yeah I
83:40 - tried to change it a little bit so yeah
83:45 - uh your program C sharp for living that
83:48 - to think about it for a second yeah I
83:51 - mean that that is a perfectly natural
83:53 - thing even for me I've been making games
83:56 - programming and using entity for so long
83:58 - and if there's still many things that I
84:00 - have to use my brain think for a little
84:02 - bit so yeah
84:03 - so much for the videos you make that's
84:04 - awesome all right so yeah it seems
84:07 - there's literally nobody else on the
84:09 - other one
84:10 - so if I end the quiz
84:12 - and in the quiz any up there you go it
84:14 - is indeed correct so basically you can
84:16 - Implement multiple interfaces but you
84:19 - can only extend one base less that is
84:21 - one of the limitations and one of the
84:23 - reasons why you should use interfaces
84:25 - over base classes and also inheritance
84:28 - is always a I talk about that in
84:31 - actually don't remember which one is it
84:33 - on the kitchen object but I don't know I
84:34 - talk about it on the
84:36 - on the course about the issues with
84:38 - inheritance and how it can definitely
84:40 - become quite tricky quite quickly so it
84:43 - is something that you can use because it
84:44 - is a very powerful thing but definitely
84:46 - you have to be careful when you use them
84:48 - whereas with interface personally I'm a
84:51 - huge fan of interface I think they are
84:52 - awesome especially since with uh so C
84:55 - sharp 7 you can use default
84:56 - implementations
84:57 - so that means you can write an interface
84:59 - and actually write the code so if you
85:02 - don't know what I'm talking about here's
85:03 - a quick test
85:05 - so instead of making a public class you
85:07 - can make it an interface so I my
85:10 - interface
85:11 - you can do this and then inside you can
85:13 - have a function my function and do
85:18 - something and then on a class you would
85:20 - implement this interface and again as it
85:22 - says on the question you can Implement
85:24 - multiple interface
85:25 - both of the c-sharp 7 you can also do
85:28 - something awesome which is over here
85:30 - you can do a default implementation so
85:33 - if you have an interface and already
85:34 - have a bunch of objects that Implement
85:36 - that interface and you want to add
85:38 - something new you can add a default
85:39 - implementation and everything won't work
85:42 - perfectly so you don't have to actually
85:43 - add the implementation but you can if
85:45 - you want to so interface are super
85:47 - awesome for example if you got a game
85:48 - and some objects have an inventory and
85:51 - some objects don't you can use an
85:52 - interface to say I has enter I has
85:56 - inventory and Implement that interface
85:58 - on any object that has an inventory so
86:00 - interface are super powerful
86:03 - and there is something that I definitely
86:05 - use quite a lot in the course and I've
86:06 - got a dedicated video on them so if you
86:08 - don't know about interfaces definitely
86:10 - watch the course and then definitely
86:11 - watch that video
86:13 - okay so yeah another awesome thing so I
86:16 - hope some of you are learning something
86:18 - new from this even though I'm looking on
86:20 - the side most people got 100 right so
86:22 - I'm not sure maybe I should have made
86:24 - the questions quite a bit harder maybe
86:27 - okay
86:29 - uh all right so let's do
86:32 - one more and then I think that's gonna
86:34 - be it because my voice already messed up
86:37 - how did you sell your first games well
86:39 - my first games were made with flash and
86:40 - back with flash that was uh basically it
86:43 - was sponsoring so basically a a company
86:46 - a sponsor would uh pay the flash
86:49 - developer and then it would show up a
86:51 - logo of that company with a link to the
86:53 - website and so on so usually those were
86:55 - flashy importance so I would make a game
86:57 - I would put it on a website for selling
86:59 - flash games then a company who contacted
87:01 - me say we'll give you 300 bucks if you
87:03 - put the link the logo with our custom
87:06 - animation and so on yeah pretty much
87:08 - kind of like a publisher that's that's
87:09 - kind of what they did yeah they had the
87:11 - game portals so for example a lot of you
87:13 - probably already know armor games so
87:15 - that was one of the big ones back then
87:18 - yeah pretty much
87:20 - uh okay right so thank you so much for
87:22 - the Super Chat and there's another one
87:24 - oh boy there's even more I'm sorry I'm
87:26 - trying to keep up uh Olivia I'm
87:28 - assistant engineer and thinking of going
87:30 - into coding games on a task apart from
87:32 - coding for your games did you work as a
87:34 - coder somewhere else and nope the answer
87:36 - is nope I didn't I pretty much just I've
87:39 - never had a regular job so if any of you
87:41 - have questions with regards to finding a
87:42 - job in the industry I am not the right
87:44 - person to to answer about that because
87:46 - yeah I've never had a
87:48 - a job anywhere else doing anything else
87:51 - although I have done a lot of things by
87:53 - myself so I've done some some regular
87:55 - applications I've done some websites a
87:58 - bunch of things so I have done a lot of
88:00 - things but not professionally and
88:02 - professionally making games that's
88:03 - pretty much the only thing I've ever
88:05 - done so thanks so much only VA for the
88:08 - super Channel thanks so much another one
88:10 - whatever you're saying and is it was
88:12 - this a
88:14 - hey yeah because my overlay does not
88:16 - support the what is it called the
88:18 - stickers
88:19 - I don't know but thank you so much Tech
88:22 - vir Singh Is that how you pronounce it
88:24 - that's a nice name nice
88:26 - chess lab that's one uh okay so
88:29 - let me put another question here
88:33 - so one more question okay so this one is
88:36 - hopefully a bit trickier
88:39 - so let's see this one
88:42 - how it goes
88:45 - okay so this one is actually related to
88:47 - lecture
88:49 - 14. so this one about c-sharp events and
88:53 - C sharp events you use something called
88:54 - a function signature so the question is
88:56 - what is a function signature so is it a
88:58 - the function name is it B the return
89:00 - type and parameter types or is it C the
89:03 - return type the function name the
89:05 - parameter types and parameter names so
89:07 - which one of these is correct so which
89:09 - one of these relates to the function
89:11 - signature so let's see go ahead and
89:13 - start to vote and let's see
89:17 - you should probably add a nice clock
89:19 - what is that
89:21 - oh boy now I don't remember countdown is
89:23 - that the thing the British game show
89:25 - which has a a nice timer with a nice
89:28 - sound that was fun uh
89:32 - uh all right so there you go lots of
89:34 - votes
89:35 - I didn't even see it's gonna be funny
89:37 - looking at this uh the chat rate for
89:40 - this for this stream is quite
89:43 - interesting lots of spikes lots of
89:45 - things anyways uh yeah
89:49 - all right
89:54 - it's countdown I only know countdown
89:56 - because of the skit on on uh the IT
90:01 - Crowd that was really funny where Moss
90:04 - becomes really hardcore into countdown
90:06 - becomes a famous person within that
90:09 - Circle that was fun
90:10 - all right
90:13 - okay so people are voting seems the
90:15 - majority thinks that it's C the return
90:17 - type the function name the parameter
90:19 - types and the parameter names
90:21 - how do you make better character design
90:24 - I mean that's an art question so I am
90:27 - definitely not the right person to teach
90:28 - about art so yep nice to netenba
90:32 - uh that was really funny yeah
90:36 - I still I still memorize the uh what's
90:40 - it called the the replacement to 999
90:44 - what's that one oh one one eight nine
90:46 - nine nine eight eight one nine five nine
90:50 - one one nine
90:52 - oh God no I forgot
90:55 - 723
90:58 - oh God no I forgot the last numbers
91:00 - uh anyway that was fun okay uh I had a
91:04 - spin pen like you you search for pen
91:05 - tricks and so on and that's uh what's a
91:08 - b bone not Super Chat cute thank you so
91:10 - much hey CPU it's live quiz seems to be
91:12 - very fun thanks for doing them yeah this
91:14 - was a fun idea that I had and so far
91:16 - it's working great I mean this is a UNT
91:17 - window and so far it hasn't crashed
91:19 - everything is working so yeah I'm very
91:21 - I'm very pleased with this so if all of
91:23 - you are enjoying this I will hopefully
91:25 - be doing more in the future all right so
91:29 - yeah the function signature so let's go
91:31 - ahead and end the quiz and let's see
91:33 - which one is the correct answer
91:36 - and for this one I really need a drum
91:40 - roll so I should probably have a drum
91:42 - roll and there you go and there you go
91:44 - the answer is B so now the majority was
91:47 - actually wrong for the first time wow
91:49 - that is interesting so yep the answer is
91:51 - B for the function signature what
91:53 - matters is the return type and the
91:55 - parameter types meaning that the
91:57 - function name and the parameter names
91:58 - that does not matter so you can have a
92:01 - function with different names different
92:03 - parameter names as long as the types are
92:05 - correct that is the one thing that
92:07 - really does matter all right so look at
92:09 - that yeah for this one I won yeah that
92:12 - definitely got a bunch of people off 100
92:14 - so there you go rookie at 100 with 16
92:17 - right answers
92:19 - what do I win I'm not sure I should
92:21 - probably come up with some prizes some
92:22 - things yeah remember that from here
92:24 - download gets video yeah that's nice
92:25 - awesome yeah because that is for
92:27 - delegates so if uh some of you don't
92:30 - know what I'm talking about for example
92:32 - let's make over here
92:34 - a delegate
92:37 - my delegate returns an INT an INT and
92:42 - has a string for some kind of parameter
92:46 - and now I can make a private void uh up
92:51 - right and my function
92:54 - with a string my string
92:58 - and this one
93:00 - is a function return minus one just to
93:03 - get rid of that error and basically over
93:06 - here this function does match this
93:08 - delegate signature so basically what
93:10 - matters is the return time so they both
93:12 - return end and they both have a string
93:14 - parameter now the actual name the
93:16 - delegate does not have to match and the
93:17 - actual name of the parameter also does
93:19 - not have to match so if I make a private
93:21 - a field of type my delegates so my
93:25 - delegate field if I do this I can do my
93:27 - delegate equals my function
93:29 - and yep there you go that does work
93:31 - because this one does have the exact
93:33 - same signature as that delegate so they
93:35 - both return in they both have a string
93:37 - and it does not matter that this one is
93:39 - called parameter over here is my string
93:41 - that does not matter for the function
93:42 - signature all that matters are the types
93:44 - of this so yeah look at that so A bunch
93:47 - of you actually got it wrong so that was
93:49 - fun
93:50 - so that means that a bunch of you uh
93:52 - learned something new so hopefully that
93:54 - is the positive takeaway so nice
93:57 - training your streams are so creative
93:58 - yeah thank you so much thank you for the
94:01 - super Channel thank you for being here
94:02 - thank you for watching that is fun
94:04 - another Super Chat you and there's even
94:05 - more Hey
94:06 - whenever you have time search and watch
94:09 - this video speed up compile times in
94:11 - unity with assembly definitions yeah I
94:13 - do have a lecture about assembly
94:15 - definitions on my ultimate TNT overview
94:17 - course
94:18 - so this one
94:22 - who made that is that a a oh look at
94:25 - that there it is live right now that's
94:27 - one uh
94:29 - oh times in UNT with simile definitions
94:34 - is this an official oh it's the one from
94:36 - Game Dev guide yep definitely assembly
94:38 - definitions if you have problems with
94:40 - compilation time definitely use them
94:41 - basically that's one way that you can
94:43 - split your code into multiple assemblies
94:45 - so if you modify just one line of code
94:48 - on one file you won't actually recompile
94:50 - the entire game which if you don't use
94:52 - assembly definitions and that's what
94:53 - happens you modify a single file and it
94:55 - won't recompile every single file
94:57 - whereas if you use assembly definitions
94:59 - by modifying one file will only
95:01 - recompile that assembly so if you have a
95:03 - huge code base it can still be really
95:05 - fast to compile as long as it's nicely
95:07 - separated into different assemblies on
95:09 - different parts so whenever you modify
95:11 - something only that assembly gets
95:13 - recompiled so if you use tons tons of
95:15 - them then even on a huge project it can
95:18 - definitely be super fast
95:20 - all right
95:21 - so yeah thanks for sharing for that tip
95:23 - so those of you who don't know similar
95:24 - definitions definitely watch this video
95:26 - Game Dev guide usually has great videos
95:28 - or if you have my ultimately in the
95:30 - overview of course I also have a lecture
95:32 - on that so yeah that is really awesome
95:33 - thank you
95:34 - not Super Chat tuned
95:39 - sorry about the name or your tutorials
95:41 - yeah that's great make journal series on
95:43 - how to host your multiplayer game using
95:46 - unity's new cloud game server hosting
95:47 - multiplayer yep that is definitely one
95:49 - of the things that I do want to cover
95:51 - I'm hoping to cover that on the upcoming
95:54 - multiplayer course and I'm also
95:56 - hopefully hoping to make a separate
95:58 - tutorial just on that subject so yeah
96:00 - that is definitely something that I
96:01 - definitely want to cover although I
96:03 - haven't done any research yet so I'm not
96:05 - sure I'm not sure when but yep
96:08 - definitely on the plan definitely
96:09 - something that I want to do so thank you
96:11 - so much
96:12 - not a super chat okay winner can choose
96:15 - a video idea I mean that would be a fun
96:18 - one a fun prize but I already have way
96:22 - too much work so I'm not sure that would
96:23 - be very doable I think if I made that
96:25 - the price I'm not sure I could guarantee
96:27 - that I would end up making it so yeah
96:30 - that would be fun but yeah I've got I
96:32 - have to say like a video ideas
96:33 - definitely something that I don't have
96:35 - I've got a billion things that I wish I
96:37 - could make if only I could clone myself
96:39 - so that I could work on 10 different
96:41 - ideas at the same time I'd love to do
96:43 - that so yeah that would be that would be
96:46 - fun thank you so much
96:47 - another Super Chat yeah there you go
96:50 - choose a video idea that would be fun so
96:52 - yeah thank you so much
96:53 - all right
96:55 - okay so that was a a fun question all
96:58 - right so I think that's gonna be it
97:00 - because I'm already my voice is already
97:02 - pretty messed up I can't talk way too
97:04 - much
97:06 - some people are at 100 last question
97:08 - yeah the 100 is just questions uh
97:13 - answers versus the total so yeah so for
97:17 - example over here barricade answered 15
97:20 - and got 15 right even though there were
97:22 - apparently at least 16 questions so yeah
97:24 - that's the the percentage is not
97:26 - percentage of total questions it's
97:27 - answered versus correct
97:29 - okay all right so I think that's gonna
97:32 - be it
97:32 - I need to go
97:34 - eat something drink something and my
97:37 - dogs are
97:44 - okay all right okay so I think that is
97:49 - gonna be it okay
97:51 - so let me just put this I'm Gonna Leave
97:53 - This on for a little bit and then let's
97:56 - see
97:58 - all right so let me just organize
98:00 - everything and it is correct
98:04 - all right so yeah thank you all so much
98:05 - for being here on this live stream this
98:07 - was a different thing it was an
98:08 - experiment and well so far it went
98:10 - pretty well so I'm pretty happy with how
98:12 - it went so hopefully all of you enjoyed
98:14 - it so hopefully a bit more in the in the
98:17 - future so my plan for this year is
98:18 - definitely doing a bunch more live
98:20 - streams and experiment with different
98:21 - things kind of like this so hopefully
98:23 - you enjoyed it so thank you all so much
98:25 - for being here so let me just prepare
98:27 - things and I gotta go like this all
98:30 - right all right so yeah thank you all so
98:32 - much for being here thank you so much

Cleaned transcript:

foreign thank you foreign thank you alright hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right quite a lot of people already here wow nice thank you all right so hopefully this should be fun okay everything seems to be correct all right okay great all right thank you Daniel for becoming a channel member and thanks again for sharing for a nice cup of coffee that's always useful so thank you so much all right hey everyone okay impressed this kind of inventory you have you mean the characters yeah I've been working on this lately usually I got my characters on on screen but for this one for this stream I'm planning to try out something different so we're going to make a sort of q a sort of a quiz where I can post a question then you can vote in chat and then we can see and learn a bunch of things together that's pretty much the goal with this live stream as usual it's an experiment so hopefully it won't break so hopefully everything here so far is working correctly all right okay great so let's see how this goes all right so just first of all just for testing let me actually make a simple question so just for testing let's go Create a quiz and there you go all right so let me just hide the background where's my background the background okay great all right so there you go a very simple and basic quiz and basically you vote in chat by doing vote and then either A or B that's pretty much the goal and let's see if all of this works correctly so as you vote there you go the little characters they move there it's recently but all right look at that all right that's great so far it seems to be working correctly all right so we got a lot of votes seems to be pretty much 50 50. so that's interesting so I'm going to vote myself a zone so in my case I'm going to go with dogs so I'm going to vote B and there you go all right and look at that cats are winning all right I mean I'm just happy that it's working so yeah so basically yeah instead of just saying A or B say uh uh uh exclamation point vote and then either A or B so basically all the people that are still waiting they are up here and then the character moves into one or the other position once you actually vote and actually mine did not move did I find some bug no there you go there's my character going into the B position all right great look at that it's pretty much 50 30. uh that's funny all right but yeah look at that perfectly 50 50 oh dog's winning okay so the system is indeed working all right and then well the next part is when there's a question when the time is just visual so I can then manually end it and I can either say one question is correct or all of them are correct so in this case um they are correct so let's go ahead end the quiz and there you go they're all correct they're all happy everybody succeed all right great okay so it seems the system is working so far so that's right so there you go can I vote C none of them no really no and right away I noticed there's a bug seeing the aren't supposed to be visible so apparently when I finish they all become green but that's okay all right that works fine all right okay okay so basically I'm going to try to show some questions and you can vote on the answer then I can talk about some learning thing related to the question and in meantime sure you can post questions in in chat and I'll do my best to try to keep this thing managed okay in some kind of YouTube integration yes this is using the uh the Youtube API and if you want to customize your own character just like you can see a bunch of people have custom characters then I see a SpiderMan around here somewhere uh anyway there's my character which has a custom Sprite and there you go look at that there's a nice Raymond so Timberland Jones there you go and ice on anybody else using custom characters nope just one all right so yeah basically you can go into this link and if you want you can draw on top of it and then your character won't have a custom Sprite so it's just a nice fun thing and if you want to know how I made this I actually also covered it down here there's a bunch of links so there's the transparency window which actually isn't being used here this is just a regular window then the characters they are using some mesh based animations and for interacting with the YouTube API that is using an HTTP request from Unity that's pretty much it so oh no something pretty simple but yeah it looks pretty fun look at that ring man that looks pretty cool okay great all right so let me just get ready to start posting the first proper question once again thank you so much for sharing for the cup of coffee thank you so much and thank you Daniel new channel remember so this one oh look at that a new channel member thank you unless thank you that's cool it's awesome when I come back to this overlay and everything suddenly Works magically uh asking what happened to the multiplayer section yep I'm still working on it I'm currently researching what is the best way to convert the game to multiplayer so I'm selling the research phase then I've got to I've got to make a prototype then I have to record on uh write on the lectures then I have to record everything then I have to edit and then publish so hopefully by the end of this month it should have the multiplayer course should be out hopefully by the end of this month hopefully all right okay so let me first post a first post the first question okay this is a bit tricky because I gotta do it manually but sure let me just put it can I put it side by side okay like that's good okay so that's the first option and the second option the third option and hopefully everything won't work correctly there you go create quiz and there you go the brand new question so what is the name of the game relating to the game in the free course so is it kitchen chaos cloner cooked or Chef chaos so go ahead and post your vote in the chat and let's see if all of you know all right and obviously on the side here I've got the page for the websites on we're going to go through a bunch of lectures and answer a bunch of questions do a bunch of things so let's see if one of you know the first basic question I mean the clue is kind of on screen but yeah let's see let's see if all of you know it just expand a little bit all right all right look at that so there's two song Theory people on C and for some reason some people aren't even though there's no d right now some people wouldn't be and most people over here on a there you go look that all those people there's Raymond there oh look there's a Spiderman I know who all right that's nice another Rayman is it supposed to have two Raymonds or is that a bug I don't know okay let me vote myself as well so I'm going to vote a so let's see and all right okay so there's something time left actually played around with the timer I mean hey yep there you are all right for phone to PC that's why there's two Raymonds yeah maybe it's just funny that's great voting you won't crash everything no hopefully not you can try to vote e just won't do anything just won't recognize because at most there's only four options so hopefully the code is correct how do we change our character sprite just follow the guide on the website all right so there you go there's a question and let me go ahead and the quiz and the correct one for this one is obviously a kitchen chaos someone's in the quiz and there you go everybody's really happy nice okay so most people got it right some people see them waiting some people put BNC and so on and over here we've got the leaderboard so let's see by the end how many so pretty much this is the number of correct questions and on the right side is the percentage so right now so far two correct questions 100 so pretty much everybody over here on the on the leaderboards all of them got it right and everything suddenly froze oh God something bad happened actually something bad apparently didn't happen uh uh exactly happened not sure but okay let's keep going and hopefully it won't break completely if there's something strange move position direct was destroyed okay all right anyways hopefully everything is still working correctly all right so that's great so I've validated that my nice little tool that's where someone for the no it's not because someone voted e Apparently one of these characters was destroyed for some reason but then some code is still getting it so right over here can I put it here there you go got a missing reference exception so some object is still finding something so it kind of broke but let's hope it doesn't actually cause a crash anyways if it does I can only just restart it I've got a nice load for the leaderboard so that should be fun and thank you once again and listen there you go and you shall remember another one rookie thank you so much all right that's nice I don't know how many channel members this has so it's a fun feature all right okay so let me just so yes the answer of course was kitchen chaosa was the correct answer so here it is it's a fun name I don't like it I think it was cool all right so let's begin let's see so let's see another easy question just make sure that you all understand how to vote so let's go just basing in all of the options and create the quiz there you go here is the new question so Hong Kong is the free course is it a two hours B five hours or C 10 hours so let's see if all of you know how much is it so let's see all right they're going lots of votes I'm going to vote myself as well which is kind of odd though because if you can see me then technically you know yeah maybe I shouldn't vote otherwise that might be a little bit cheating when it becomes a more complex questions so let's see all right and there you go most people voting on 10 hours let's see if that is indeed correct all right like about font front Sprite for Rayman looks really weird now yeah with all of the other ones facing forward but so I think Rayman looks great I mean when I was coming up with design for these characters for this machine mission system actually it was around the time when Prison Architect came out so that was more the sort of inspiration doing something simple like that rather than Raymond but yep Raymond also works perfectly with this tunnel since there are no arms and so on yeah this matter seeks capital or not nope on the code I made sure to check for that so if you post if you write with or without space it works if you put an uppercase on lowercase it works so hopefully it should work most of the time new sound popup is UI in unity oh yeah yeah this is inside Unity so here is a window I can even drag it and so on so yeah this one is inside Unity it is not a OBS uh element even though those are sometimes fun even vote box looks weird especially since it looks to the side oh right if you purchased right here moving that yeah I guess if he moves down that would be yeah then actually see movie if he moves on I guess that would be a bit tricky I got a meal from him is that so that's great all right so yeah let's end this one and obviously the correct question is indeed C so let's put the answer isn't DT so let's end the quiz and there you go all of them celebrating so yep that is indeed the correct question all right so congrats everyone that's great how did you do that you mean the elements one they are using the uh YouTube API and if you want to know how to make you just pretty much just have to do an HTTP request from inside unity and you can interact with the YouTube API and that's pretty much how it works so you can watch that video and that's pretty much how it goes was there a guy on age hearing maybe he was on the way to see and that is why he stopped in the middle when I stopped so that's probably why all right okay so let's go and yeah let's start with a proper question so let's go create the quiz let me select all of the possible options and this one and this one and let's put it like that and let's see okay so let's create a brand new question okay so here it is so this is on the lecture for the creative project and the question is which anti version did I use in the course so was it the 2021 LTS the 2022 Tech version or was it the 23 Alpha version so go ahead post your votes and this one is with regards to the create project manager so by the way over here on the website here is the course molecule and if you click on one of these it automatically Scrolls down so there you go the question is related to in lecture one for creating the project all right so people voting some people saying LTS some people saying tech let's see which is which all right okay so there you go everybody Boeing all right foreign end the quiz and see which one is the correct question correct answer and there you go you have the correct answer is indeed over here B and it is the tech version so usually Technically when it comes to UNT versions you should probably stick with the NTS version but the only reason why I went with the tech version for this uh course is because I want the course I want the video to stay up to date for as long as possible so technically usually you should use LTS I just went to Tech because Tech is going to translate going to turn into the LTS version in about two weeks two months so yes technically you should always use LTS the only reason why I didn't is to make sure that the video stays up to date for as long as possible but yeah in your own projects definitely stick with LTS which in about two or three months usually around March or April that's when Unity launches their brand new MTS version So at around that time 22 should turn into LTS so at that time you should be able to use that one all right so there you go that's a nice question and everything is a bit a bit like that yeah maybe I'll I'll restart the overall oh no it's good now okay I don't know sometimes becomes a bit strange all right and once again thank you so much for becoming Channel member another one Timbo Jones yeah thank you thank you for becoming a channel member thank you all right okay so that was the first proper question so congratulations and over here on the right side still see a bunch of people with all four correct 100 so that's great let's see let's see how much this one is by the end okay all right so let's go for the next question so let's create a brand new quiz for this lecture go with yes or no and there you go all right so let's see the next question so let's create the quiz and there you go here is the question so this one is with regards to lecture two so that's in layout picture so this one is do you know about the pivot Center and local logo buttons so do you yes no maybe can you repeat the question so let's see who gets this reference and yeah there you go so the questions with regards to the pivot Center and local Global buttons these are extremely important you definitely need to know about them so let's see how many of you know about them so this one is kind of a general knowledge question so let's see but it is something that I cover in the unity layout lecture so let's see out of this question all right so most people are getting TS that's awesome because this is actually two very important buttons that a lot of people don't know about so yeah someone asking how many questions are there in total I'm not sure I mean I think that's going to be limited to the time for the live stream so I'm going to do this for about one hour so let's see how many questions we can get through in that time okay all right so there you go still got a bit more and over here on the side I've got a nice test project so I can use that one to demonstrate whether something is all right so let's see there you go 20 seconds how many of you yes six people no 11 Maybe until you repeat the question all right so let's see do you know about these buttons for some reason the owners constantly doing something that's strange uh all right okay so let's go ahead end the quiz and for this one there's really no wrong answer because it's a general so congratulations to all of you all right so the pivot Center on local button so let me put a nice testing window over here so here is a basic testing project just to test it out and basically the buttons that I'm referring to are the ones up here on the scene view so there's this one on this side which says Center or pivot and there's another one which is global or local and basically these are extremely important so for example if you've got a game object let's make it a cube instead so let's make an empty Cube there you go here is a cube and if inside I put another object so let's say I put another Cube inside this Cube and for this other Cube let's put it somewhere on the sign so now if I select the parent object and if over there it is Select nonpivot look at where the transform handle is it's right there it's exactly on the origin of that object however if up there if now I change to center now instead of being on the pivot now it's over there on the center so if you didn't know about this and for example you tried rotating now if you try rotating you would assume that it would rotate right over there where the handle is but if you move to the side and actually right now yeah right because it's moving on the if you look over there it is now rotating just on the Y but also moving on the X and also moving on the Z so if I move it even further away and now it's like this one there you go with that one set to center now it actually selects the transform handle right on the center and if I rotate it look over there it's not just rotating on the Y if I rotate on the wire it rotates like this but if I rotate on the handle it rotates like that so this is something that is usually very confusing if you don't know what is going on so if you were to rotate here you would be very confused as to why it's not rotating around the tool handle so that is why this is extremely important and pretty much in 99 of cases you want to leave this one on pivot that's that way it makes sense so if you rotate over there it rotates on the pivot exactly as it should so example like this and the next one that one is the local or Global so that is with regards to rotation so for example let's say on the parent I rotate this one let's rotate it point it upwards like this so like this this is set on local mode and look at how the handles are rotated kind of slanted whereas if I put this in global now the handles have the global rotation so regardless of how the object is rotated these are always like this so if I move over here on the red arrow you would assume that it moves just on the I think the red is the Zen or now it's in CX you would think by this you would only move on the X whereas if I put it on local if I put them like this this one is moved based on the rotation that the object is in so if you want to put an object in front of it somewhere like this and you won't just push the object to the side then it's usually better to use it on local whereas if you want to move it relative to the world itself put it on global and move it around so yeah basically these two are some of the things that can really drive you crazy if you don't know about them so in most cases you really want to leave this one on pivot and this one either on local or Global depending on the use case so that's one of those things that a lot of people don't know about and can definitely drive you crazy if you don't know so hopefully now a bunch of you have learned something new so hopefully that's nice all right so that was a question and that one there was no wrong answer so congratulations to all of you all right great why do you name the channel and Code Monkey I always like the the term Code Monkey even though technically it's supposed to be kind of a negative but I always found it was pretty fun so yeah when I actually wanted to name my my game Studio I wanted to name it that but there was already a developer called Code Monkey so I couldn't use it for my game Studio but when it came time to making it for this for this YouTube channel for this one decided hey why don't I go back to that to that idea that I had previously so yeah and yep there's also a song called Code Monkey which is almost so pretty fun all right okay so let's go and thank you so much Timbo Jones thank you all right okay so let's go into the next question so this one is going to be on the lecture on Visual Studio so let's go ahead create the quiz all right so here is the question so in the lecture for visual studio so what Visual Studio extension did I use for the extra colors in the code so was it called Commodore plus is it nothing is it just a visual studio this phone defaults or is it vs4 so go ahead post your votes and let me open up visual studio over here just so we can see in a little bit all right there you go a bunch of votes coming in okay all right my visual studio is opening let me just make sure that I uh I always forget where the extensions the installed ones yep that's what I'm okay great uh now let me go back and see chat because I can't see it right now all right there you go Okay so go ahead if I knew this was coming up on the test I'd have studied more for it yep I mean everything is on the test so yeah go ahead and hopefully this helps you gain some knowledge that's going with this with this nice little live stream so we can all learn together and hopefully it should be fun all right okay so there you go 20 seconds left go ahead and post your vote so it seems a lot of people are confident in seeing is that correct some people are still over here stuck on D I don't know why because there's no d right now but yeah all right so let's see which one is correct make my game using kitchen Carol's assets yep go ahead and use yes in your own projects I hope you like it I skipped this one so I'm doing the majority yeah usually that is probably a a a good approach in this little quiz if you go with the majority I wonder maybe there's a question that the majority won't go wrong I don't know let's see all right so let's go ahead and see which one is the correct answer and the correct answer is C indeed it is the ashfora yep so that it is my character isn't appearing yep there it is right there all right so this is a really nice extension let me just so here is my visual studio and basically on extensions magic extensions and over here if you search for online you'll find vsphora and there you go it adds color to your Visual Studio text editor so this is the one that I use in the course and basically what it does it adds a bunch more colors so look at this over here the default in the case in a nice pink so the switch and nice orange and the types in a different color than the functions in another color then the builtin Unity functions in a different color and so on so basically adds a whole bunch of colors let me see if I've got a more complex project somewhere in here so I've got a big project uh let me find something a bit more complex okay so let's see this on the game Handler setup and there you go so we got a bunch more colors so like this with all these colors you know there you go nice string nice comments so with this I find this is a it's pretty much the only extension that I have outside of defaults and I find that it helps quite a lot having all these colors really makes the code much easier to read much easier to see okay here's the return else if and so on here's the type of function call and so on so yep I would definitely recommend you grab this extension so that is called and yep 61 of you did indeed correctly guess so yep congratulations all right okay so that was the correct answer okay what about resharper that's an addon yeah I've heard great things about resharper but I've never actually used it too much but yeah I do know that it does a lot of things same thing with uh what is it called jetbrains Rider a lot of people also like that idea for me I stick when I stick with the visual studio just because it's what I know but yeah basically nowadays there's pretty much no wrong option anything you choose all the tools nowadays are pretty excellent so yeah sorry I don't know if there's a similar one for for Rider no idea is there an alternative for vs format oh yeah that's right I'm sorry I don't think they're I mean I'm sure there is so if you search for something oh right there is made by the same company that made Richard oh really I didn't know that that's nice uh yeah so for visual studio on Mac you probably need to Google it I'm sure there's there has to be something related to I mean it's just that in color so there has to be but yeah sorry I don't know it's a vs4 is Windows only so yeah don't really know for that one okay all right so that's the question and over here on the right side yep it's only got a bunch of people with a hundred percent I wonder how long is this going to keep up all right so let's see the next question did I close this question I did right yeah now I forget uh yeah okay so let's see the next question so this one is from lecture four so over here let me just scroll down to lecture 4 which is one of the most important lectures it's a lecture on code style and naming rules so let's see what is the question and there you go okay so here's the question which is which one of these is correct so Pascal case camel case and snake case all right so go ahead and make your votes and which one of these is correct these are the names for the capitalization of the letters the words and so on so these are the three main types that most people use so Pascal case is it capitalized in front and middle or is it uh lowercase over there uppercase in there is camel case and lowercase and then uppercase or upper and upper is it lower and then phone case is snake case with an underscore with Dash with DOT let's see which one is it okay all right so go ahead make your votes and let us see all right so a lot of people are really confident in a so is that the one that is correct all right I just decided on Unity versus other platforms when I started which was back in 2012 that was when I started researching uh game engines because I wanted to move on from Flash and make something that I could play on my on my PC and yeah back then Unity was the only option so it kind of went by default but yeah since then uh it works for building any kind of game that I can think of so yeah that is why so I started because it was the only option and I kept with it because it's a great tool works great so that's pretty much the answer all right so which one is correct and everybody is really confident on a there's a bunch of people lost here on D A bunch of people on c and a bunch of people on B love you hey and love you too thanks for being here all right so let us see let's end the quiz and let's see which one is indeed correct and if there you go it is indeed option A so congratulations to all of you all right that's awesome it's awesome that so many people didn't know this one all right that was great yeah that is great so yeah if you if you haven't seen the course yet definitely go ahead watch a YouTube video it's linked in the description and definitely make sure to pay attention to this lecture specifically just learning this is one of the things that will massively grow your skills as a programmer so definitely make sure you always use the correct naming rules I mean correct is a bit of a wrong word the important thing is that you are consistent so whatever naming rules you follow doesn't matter you can follow Pascal case for functions or maybe use pastel case for for class names or maybe use it for fields or maybe properties whatever you want so you can use whatever naming rules on whatever thing you want the most important thing when it comes to code style naming rules just being consistent so whatever you do whatever you choose come up with a sound that makes sense to you and then stick with it that's pretty much it alright so congratulations to all of you where's my character there you go somewhere in here what should I do when I finish your course well you can go and try building an original game if you want go ahead take the knowledge that you gained from the course and try building something nice and original and hopefully you will have gained quite a nice amount of knowledge that won't enable you to build pretty much any game you can okay so yeah congratulations once again and over here almost there got a bunch of people not on 100 which is great because it means that hopefully you'll learn something new so definitely don't feel bad if you get one of these questions wrong the home point is to learn so yeah if you get it wrong you can learn something then that is awesome you learned it all right great okay Turtle it's been two years since I started my Kim Dev journey and even the most helpful person hey Aaron Collins VR hey that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad to hear that I'm always very happy to hear that people have enjoyed tutorials that they have helped you in any way so yeah that is awesome best of luck in all of your Game Dev Journeys and all of your individual ones hopefully the videos help you so we can all just make games and have fun together so hopefully all right some kept the boxes in there yeah they're like oh hey CPU hey thanks for being here yeah there you go got a bunch more custom characters yeah keeping the boxes in there the Box are meant for guiding you don't necessarily but yeah it's kind of funny head right and there you go it is the head pointing right all right okay so let's go on to the next question yeah I think I'm going a bit slow because it's already been 40 minutes okay so let's go let's I keep forgetting that if I end the the question or not I think I did yeah okay so the next one is on postprocessing and once again we are going to have another interesting four options so let's go let's create the quiz all right so there's a question this one is with regards to the postprocessing lecture there you go someone answered already okay so with regards to post processing should you add postprocessing as soon as possible so yes no maybe can you repeat the question so let's see which is which all right go ahead and start voting and let's see what do all of you vote for this one let's see it's gonna be fun all right okay all right there you go so on this one got a nice mix yes no all right let us see what do all of you so this one is really hard so the electron post processing which actually yeah actually got the the thing over here so let's see the postprocessing lecture and if I go put it on plane yeah that's kind of the issue with having an 11 hour is that I can't really click in there to see it I gotta go to the sign there you go adding some nice visual assets then adding a volume component and starting to add a bunch there you go look at that a lot of Bloom way too much Bloom got a nice little checklist to make sure that everything loads and playing around with empty analyzing and so on there you go I'll just trying to make the visuals actually look pretty good all right so there you go 10 more seconds let's see so it seems the majority thinks that it's no so is that the correct answer I don't know let's see all right there you go two seconds one second and let's end the quiz and which one is the correct answer and the answer is all of them are correct basically when it comes to postprocessing usually you probably shouldn't do it like literally at the first thing so you should probably focus on the actual mechanics and the actual things so personally for me post processing is something that I'll leave later on in the process when I actually want to show the game to someone so when I want to when I want to promote it and so on however one thing that a lot of people have mentioned which I do think that it makes a lot of sense which is post processing can also help you with regards to motivation so if you're the kind of person who has trouble with motivation motivating yourself with actually continuing to work on the game if that's the the kind of mindset that you have then postprocessing can actually help because by post processing originally making sure that your Visions look quite a bit better so if you focus on that in the very beginning that can actually help you stick with the project for the long run which in turn obviously helps you actually finish that project so for me personally the answer is no I don't really do it as soon as possible I take it for quite a bit later on in the depth process so I focus on the actual mechanics first but I can definitely see how for some people who have issues with motivation or that sort of thing then making the game actually look good I think it was actually Mark Brown when he was working on his prototype that he said that working on the visuals for quite a bit actually helped them stay motivated because the game actually looked good instead of just being a bunch of Cubes so basically the answer for this post processing as soon as possible that depends on you for me personally I'll leave it a bit later on but for a lot of people but for some other people maybe working on it in the beginning in order to make something look good that might help so yeah pretty much no wrong answer there so congratulations to all of them and Super Chat thank you create my first game just because of your awesome lessons it's announcing for wishlist Ah that's awesome so what is the name you have to say the name whenever you talk about your game so yeah that's awesome I hope it does well yeah and I hope it's also quite a bit uh further away in terms of the actual launch so I hope you left some time for Gathering wishlists so I think I think uh YouTube probably doesn't allow links but if you post the game name hopefully it's your job oh and by the way uh the game kitchen chaos is also available for free on Steam so if you want to play the final game if you want to have some fun go ahead and if you want go ahead and write a review so there are 10 reviews so now it shows up with the score so let's do it yeah all right it's okay so yeah so that was fun so all right so I hope that was a nice teachable moment about postprocessing yes or no all right okay so let's go on to the next one all right name is yeah there's a Super Chat cute hey name is paratives won't be out in three months or something to implement multiplayer wow okay multiplayer that's a bit of a a tricky one I'm curious so where's the search bar why is steam so so tiny uh para types oh God Is It Horror yeah horror is not my thing sorry so yeah I will not be playing this but yeah I mean uh looking at the trailer it doesn't look good I mean horror that's one of the main things where you definitely need to make it look the part and it certainly doesn't work the part so congratulations okay so all of you if you want to support this developer go ahead and add to your wish list heading multiplayer yeah or in multiplayer that's a interesting one what was that one that was a mega hit there was a mega hit multiplayer game recently I don't remember the name but yeah it can definitely do well but yeah horror is not my thing so either way I definitely wish you the best of luck in your multiplayer Journey all right okay ah so let's see multiplayer is a tricky one free course on multiplayer yeah hopefully in a little bit I mean technically you can definitely uh use what you learn from making uh the kitchen chaos game you can definitely what I'm going to cover in the multiplayer course you could definitely use it to convert that and learn about how to make a horror game that would definitely work so yeah that's a great news once you learn how a tune Works applying it to a multitude of different game genres that always works all right okay so let's move on to the next lecture so this one like your next question so this one is going to be on the character controller all right so let's see for this one how many people get this question right only let's create the quiz and there you go okay so question this one is on lecture seven so that's an electron on the character controller should you make all of your variables public so a no yes or yes because I want to torture my programmer teammates so let's see how many of you get this one I would hope that it's most of you because this is something that I repeat over and over again so I hope that if your wreck and Learning Channel that hopefully this one is pretty much automatic so let's hope so let's see and there you go lots of people and yep someone over there stuck in the yep there you go yeah I'm not supposed to be staying there yeah probably not all right so let's see how many of you all right so this one is on the lecture on the character controller which is pretty much the first really median lecture on the course before this it's all setting up importing the assets and so on so this is the one that really gets hits the ground running on making some nice some nice codes and by the way if you're following the course definitely make sure to check this website because I've had the frequently asked questions to a bunch of these lectures so if you want to know some things chances are you can go up here and there's possibly a question that you have it's already been answered over here so for example if the code isn't running if you don't see the logs so possibly you didn't name the player exactly you didn't attach the object maybe update is not written exactly and so on if you only see a single message that probably is on the collapse button and so on so yeah lots of interesting questions here that a bunch of people have asked and yeah so I'm constantly updating this so if you're following the course definitely make sure you check out this nice companion page okay so that's it so let's go ahead and the quiz and see which one is the answer for this one and yep of course the answer is indeed a so no you should not make all of your variables bubbling so hopefully for all of you so there's a bunch of you said yes and yes because you want to torture a bunch of people so maybe but yeah the answer is indeed no they should not automatically be public in fact they should never be public so pretty much I don't think I generally don't think I've ever seen a use case for public well the exception would be on scriptable objects so for those I usually do make them public because on a scriptable object which I always deal as a readonly data container but yeah for regular variables yeah they should never be public there's no reason to be public why never is because I actually cover that in detail so if it's probably best to watch a dedicated video instead of me repeating the same thing over again but pretty much when you make it public you are enabling both read and write access from anywhere so if I can actually go here can I create something uh there you go I think I can all right so let's see if I can if I can do something like this okay so basically you shouldn't do it because you are enabling read and write access from anything so for example over here I got a public a float for the move speed and let's say this is the character script and then I've got another one so public class for the enemy so the enemy is doing something and over here the enemy has a reference to the character so the character so this is the player character and then on Fred void update for some reason the enemy decides that it wants to mess up the character so it can go into the character set the move speed equals zero and there you go this one is perfectly valid code so the enemy can suddenly modify the move speed on the character and everything breaks and your player can no longer move because you accidentally modified something when it should never be modified so basically by making it public you are enabling both read and write axes from any other class so if you have a thousand classes in your code base then that's a thousand points where you might be modifying this which might cause all kinds of breakage things in your game so you don't want that whereas if you make this private then you know for certain only the code inside this last can actually modify this field this one cannot access it because that one is private so this one no longer can cause that bug and suddenly break everything because the player has no movement so that's the super quick explanation of it but definitely go ahead and watch the dedicated video if you just follow this one room then that's one of the simplest things you can do that will massively increase the quality of a code so definitely make sure you do it okay all right talking about an absolute is quite wrong well I would love for someone to tell me generally I would agree there's uh most things in Game Dev they aren't really absolute so there are best practices and so on however when it comes to public variables I generally do not see there is a single possible positive use case there really isn't you are enabling both read and write access from anything it just really makes everything much worse it just it just makes the code much harder to read much harder to understand so yeah when it comes to public variables I have never seen a positive use case so yeah for this one I would definitely use the absolutes definitely never ever use it that's pretty much it all right not get bruise on your hand by constantly forcing the water bottle to close I mean this one is pretty soft so yeah or I guess maybe my head is a bit too hard that's maybe it yeah but is there a video on lecture it covers this integrated chat voting scene I did make some cover some there's some tutorial links down here at the bottom of this page but basically uh it's just really working with the YouTube API so the YouTube API has a way to get the live chat comments so that's what it does I'm doing an HTTP request from inside Unity so there's a dedicated tutorial here so I do that in order to ask YouTube to get me the in live chat comments then I use that to spawn some characters and show some nice chat bubbles so that's pretty much it pretty soon hey thanks for being here on live that's nice yeah these live streams are are a bit random So yeah thank you all for for being here all right okay so let's go on to the next question so this one's gonna be on lecture eight so let's create the quiz and let's see this question a b and c now that I'm noticing yeah I think all the questions only have ABC I don't think I include any anyways okay all right so let's get once again thanks for the Super Chat and there's a cute Super Chat all right hey clippy that's nice I miss clippy it was fun thanks for being awesome hey thanks for being here uh that's nice all right so for the next question so let's create the next question okay so this one is going to be on lecture eight so that is the lecture on the character Visual and rotation so in this lecture what is the difference between lerp and slurp so his difference that slurp sounds bad which I guess maybe a little bit uh is it that LARP works with vectors and smaller ports and directions or layer ports with directions and similar ports with vectors by saying all this is a bit tricky all right so go ahead and vote and let's see oh boy there's seems to be a lot of mixed feelings about this one okay so let's see how many of you get this right this is one of those things that is actually super useful and it's also something that I have a dedicated video on well sort of dedicated it's actually a short video because it's something super simple but yeah if you want to learn about lerp or slurp which both work pretty much the same way definitely go ahead and watch this video so let's see how many of you get this right okay so it seems the nice majority is going with b and a bunch of people think that slurp sounds bad which I don't think I can disagree with okay and let's see so vectors or directions so which one works with which so let us see all right our vectors directions that depends on each person I guess for directions what I mean is kind of like a vector always with a magnitude of one whereas with Vector I mean a vector that can have any magnitude so maybe it's a tiny Vector maybe it's super long whereas the direction that one always has the same thing and just rotates points at different positions so that's kind of what I mean but yeah technically not possibly not the correct technical term but yeah I'm not a mathematician so yeah I don't know turn on for slurp well I covered LARP over here and slurp works pretty much exactly the same way except for one tiny difference which is this difference so is it vectors or is directions all right so let's go ahead and end the quiz and see which one is it and just make sure that I don't make the mistake myself alright so let's end the quiz and there you go yep the answer is over here indeed being solar works with vectors whereas slurp works with directions now the important thing with this one is for example if you make a interpolation between a vector pointing right and then a vector pointing left if you do that and you use slurp then basically it's going to rotate because it's going to work with directions whereas if you use it with alert then basically this Vector is going to shrink and then pretty much do a 180 and stick around there so that might sound a bit confusing so maybe this but yeah pretty much on if I can I make some quick testing code so if I write this testing just you show you in action let me just quickly make this so testing like void update Motel transform dot forward okay so let's do over here so with a nice testing script so basically transform that forward let's do a a math F dot slurp slurp what's up nothing at that I want the vector three which by the way there's Alert in both meth F and that and let's go into new Vector three four let's go on left so minus one zero zero and then find that Delta time okay transform Dot forward equals this okay so let's do a basic lerp and let's see what this does and over here let me just create an object put the testing and just let me okay actually I probably should have prepared these testing scenes beforehand but uh ah crap it already has okay yeah I'm trying to figure this out trying to make this trying to show the the thing in action uh right yeah I definitely should okay all right so let's see okay yeah pretty much so let me just rotate this okay something like this so let's see the okay so here is the demo that I'm showing so basically what matters over there the blue arrow So currently this one is using slurp so let's see what this one does so if I hit on play look at that blue arrow and let's see what it does and there you go it rotates around like that so look what it does next one like this I'm not sure if it's going to but let's see now let's swap it out for a lerp and let's see with LARP what this one does and if I go ahead and I hit on plane foreign okay oh is it not moving yeah I should probably add a log so we can see transform dot forward oh right because yeah so actually with this uh yeah with this demo actually work isn't going to work because transformer.4 is always going to be in normalized value so so that's funny so for the thing that I wanted to test doesn't actually work so let's do a vector 3 for the test vector and over here on what's instead use the test vector and print it out okay so I can't really see it visually because yeah you can upload before us back yeah exactly I forgot about that because it normalizes automatically So based on like this we should be able to see so there you go so this is the alert which that one should probably start off on you one zero zero okay so let's see what this does using lerp slurp always looks better than my experience yeah pretty much if you're handling rotations then lyric won't probably always look better so slurp sorry okay so this one is using lerp and basically the starting Vector is one zero so a vector point to right and look how this the vector basically becomes shorter and shorter until it gets into zero and then flips around to the other end and then becomes so basically we can shorter and then goes out whereas if you use slurp this one actually use directions instead of using a vector so if we go into this one let's see instead of becoming shortened let's see what it actually does so let's look at the vectors and there you go so it starts off in one and instead of becoming shortened this one actually rotates so this one goes down on the set so it goes down like this and rotates around instead of becoming shorter and pointing the other way so basically that's pretty much the difference so alert works with vectors so it works with multiple magnitudes whereas slower ports with Direction so if you're handling rotations you should probably stick with using slurp since that one is going to rotate around even when you do 180 degrees whereas with more the character would suddenly flip around so that's pretty much the answer okay so that was a bit a bit tricky trying to do a demo live but hopefully for those of you who didn't know about the differences between slurp and lerp hopefully that was educational and thanks again clipping thank you all right okay so let's go on to the next question so where is it let's go into this one so let's create the quiz and with this one and this one and this one okay all right so let's create a brand new question okay so this one is on lecture nine so this is the lecture on animations so if an animation has a property in yellow saying missing what exactly is the problem so is the problem that there is no child object with that exact name is it that the animation file is corrupted or was the animation not added to the animator State machine so now let me as you try to answer them let me quickly try to showcase the problem in action and I've got a visitor right now okay so let me just IDK that I alright so this is what I'm what I'm talking about there that one is in yellow so what does that mean go ahead and post your questions so there you go what does that one in yellow mean putting D for doggo yeah it's almost it's almost dinner time so that's why he's starting to get stressed all right what's his her name his and it's Tico and sister Tekken she's over there sleeping so yeah she usually stays sleeping and he's the one that that comes out all right okay so let's see which one is which multiplier Coast do you know if it's going to be Photon engine nope it's going to be using netcode for game objects so that's unity's uh the builtin official multiplayer solution so that's pretty much my digging from Japan all right okay all right okay so let's see and see which one is the answer so the answer as to why that one is in yellow saying missing so let's end the quiz and see which one is the correct answer and drum roll and there you go the answer is indeed over here a so the answer is there's no child object with that exact name should I have the same name in fact yes correct yes uh yeah basically when this happens is because there's no sound of this object named exactly head this is one of the annoying things about animations is that it's actually based on strings so it's all based on names so most of you probably already know that I hate strings for identifying things and basically the reason why this one is saying missing is because I went ahead and I modified this one so I renamed this one to head 2 so now if I play the animation that one isn't actually going to play the animation because it doesn't have any object named exactly head so the solution to this is either go up here and you can click you can click once you select and then wait a bit and then click again and you can rename the object so if I go over here and I rename this property to head 2 to match the one over there there you go now it's no longer in yellow so now it does fine now if I move there you go it does oh boy this is really it's really why is this so yeah I don't know it's very strange uh yeah so like this there you go the head is indeed moving up whereas if I put it back into that one where it says missing now I move around now the head does not move so this is always based on strings it's always based on the exact names that is one annoying thing so if you ever have this problem you just have to make sure to rename so that it matches exactly as the child was named when the animation was recorded So if you do that then you have the animation plays correctly all right okay so that was a fun one so most of you apparently already knew that so yeah it's not completely free yep it is netcode itself is free then you've got the very easy GS tools those are paid for but yep netcode itself is indeed free their idea work being stolen copied I would say if you're talking about game ideas everybody has a million game idea so definitely definitely do not definitely don't worry about that about people stealing your game ideas everybody has ideas ideas are diamond doesn't what really matters is execution so definitely don't worry definitely share your ideas with people talk about it and so on if you put head under body yeah exactly uh oh boy I'm moving the wrong window uh where's my other one if we have way too many windows open so it's quite tricky yeah if over here this one is a prefab but if I try moving can I try moving inside a preface yeah it breaks the whole thing can I duplicate this one and go into where's my prefab unpack completely yeah and now if I go in here and let's rename this one or let's remaining this one so put it on head if now I put the head inside the body and there you go now that one's also missing because yep like CPU mentioned it has to be the correct pass so this one is missing this one actually has the correct name but there's no direct child of this object named head that one is a child of the other one so if I were to make this one a channel that one there you go that does fix all right okay so that was a fun question all right now let's see what else okay so it was the electron animation so that's actually pretty fun I actually made the animations on this game myself so I'm correct I'm talking about the the kitchen counts so they're pretty pretty happy with how those came out these are simple animations but they worked pretty well all right so let's see another question this one is a quick and simple one so let's put it let's put it just 30 seconds because it's the super simple one so let's go on to the next question can I move my character by chat no it goes automatically it goes randomly and then as you vote it goes there specs of the equipment you choose let me just post the quiz uh specs well my GPU is like a 30 90 I think my monitors are like 10 years old my keyboard actually just bought it recently because my other one actually died so yeah my CPU I have no idea I built it like two years ago so my specs aren't anything I mean I guess my GPU is the only thing uh 3090 is definitely overkill for a lot of people but since I have to do a lot of video rendering for me it's really helpful to be able to render a video and not have to wait hours on end I mean even with that rendering the the course which is a 10 hour video rendering that one took quite a long time took like three hours which is actually pretty fast uh three hours to render a 10 hour video but then uploading that's the main thing that took quite a long time all right specs do you think a person needs to be able to start making game the answer is anything literally whatever you have right now as long as it's a computer because ENT doesn't run on mobile as long as it's a computer then yep all right so yeah this was a a simple question can you use an orthograph camera in a 3D game and the answer is yep you can so let me end the quiz and the answer is a yep you can use an orthographic camera even in a 3D game so there you go congrats to all of you tunic using orthography camera yeah probably it's a definitely a gorgeous game technique that was that was awesome I think for the course yeah that's great if you're gonna run the potato you're going yeah minimap tutorial yep that one also use a yeah but basically if some of you don't know what exactly is an orthographic camera so here is my demo scene so this one is for the main menu for kitchen chaos and if I select the camera where's my camera there you go my main camera and over here it set as perspective so this is like a it's what you usually think about when you think of a 3D camera but you can put it as orthographic and basically orthographic means that it doesn't I don't know the technical concern doesn't go out to the sides so pretty much any object in any position doesn't get distorted it always gets it always looks exactly the same so over here the characters they all look perfectly the same even though they are at different distances whereas with a prospective camera this one up front is much bigger and the ones on front are more squished I don't know the technical terms that's pretty much it but yeah so yeah even with 3D meshes you can still use a orthograph camera or even with two uh 2D Sprites which by the way over the characters over here these are all actual flat these Sprites so I can actually show the the if I can show here is the scene view that is running the game right now and if I go over there there you go look at that all of the characters they are all flat Sprites look at that they're on flat pointing straight at the camera so yeah this is a 3D scene so the characters are moving on the zaxis and yep there you go they are flat characters with a perspective camera which I can zoom in and zoom out and for the zoom in method this one is modifying the field of view so like this lower field of view and back out and a wider field of view so you can see a bit of uh on the corners there becomes a bit more like that right so that was another fun one so we put just this one on the side like that so there you go you can definitely use orthographic cameras in 3D games that does work and can definitely be good all right can you add subtitles yeah sorry but getting subtitles for multiple languages for the 10 hour course that would be quite tricky to do so yeah ideally I'd love to but yeah that would be quite tricky I mean even adding just in Portuguese the amount of work that it would take to translate in 11 hours that would be quite tricky so yeah how you learned unity and programming well back when I started learning back in 2012 YouTube tutorials weren't really a thing so I learned by trial and error just try to build something then it doesn't work it breaks so then go on Google and find some mysterious forums talking about things so that's pretty much it so back in my day I learned pretty much based on trial and error trying to do something doesn't work finding an error I mean the good news that Unity uses csharp and csharp is widely used so even back then so I couldn't find Unity specific things but I could definitely find C sharp related things so yeah that's pretty much how I learned so nowadays all of you are very lucky that you have lots of tutorials to teach you guided step by step yeah basically the videos that I make nowadays are the videos that I wish I had when I got certain which was yeah 10 years ago yeah over 10 years ago because I started using Unity it was in December of 2012. so we are now in 23 so yep it's been over 10 years since I've been using Unity so yeah definitely quite a lot all right why didn't you use an async method to load the scene just because the scene is is super quick so in order to unload the loading scene the loading scene is super small so yeah I'm loading that one without async doesn't really matter so yeah if you want to do something more complex then yeah definitely use the async method but for simple use cases the regular nonasync method that works great only multiplayer course be phone server authoritative and nope I mean the goal of this game it's really a a casual Coop game so for that one I'm probably going to keep things simple and just stick with using uh client authoritative because there's no it's a coop game so there's pretty much no issue with cheating but yeah that is one topic that I very much would like to cover in a feature dedicated tutorial all right okay so that's fun so let's go on to the next lecture uh all right so let's go with this one so let's Create a quiz and this one is a big one so let's see well let's see if this one actually fits the UI I hope so otherwise it's going to be tricky so let's go create the quiz for the next question so there you go this one is on lecture 12. so there is one over here on collision detection so the question is what is the difference between overlap box and boxcast so is it a overnight box sets if there's a collision on the target area and boxcasts if there's a collision anywhere between two points or is it being overlapbox the CD boxcast is reading or is it seeing over on that box is better suited for characters and boxcast for objects so go ahead and post your votes in chat alright so let's see so this one is a slightly tricky one I've seen a bunch of comments I've been answering comments for the course and yeah a bunch of people do have a question similar to this so let's see and let me prepare a simple testing scene where's my oh it's over here on this side okay all right so let me just okay all right so go ahead and vote I'm just preparing a simple testing scene okay all right so on Chats on vote and look at that seems people are convinced that it's a so is that correct and some people think that overlap box is 2D boxcast is 3D okay so let's see so this is the on the Collision detection and once again the FAQ actually the FAQ is kind of answering the question here so I guess that's a good thing about the FAQ but yeah kind of screws up the the quiz here but anyways go ahead and vote the whole point is knowledge it's not really it's not really about and look at that still tons of people getting 100 so getting all the questions right so on that's awesome congrats all right so let's go ahead and end this question and let's see which one is the answer and indeed the correct answer if there you go the correct answer is indeed a which is overlap box this if there's a collision just on the target area whereas the box has tests if there's a collision anywhere between the two points so yep that is the difference between those two so let me pick up a simple testing scene so here I've got a testing scene so let's say this is a wall and this one actually has a leather and let's say you've got a character over here and the character wants to move to this position so if you do if the character is here and you do an overlap box over here on this position then two on returned phones because it won't find any colliders because there are no colliders directly on this position whereas if you use a boxcast basically what the boxes does is it moves a virtual box or a virtual shape depends if it's a box has sphere cast and so on if it's a box gas then basically the physics system will move a virtual box in the virtual physics space and it will move from A to B and in that movement it won't find anything that collides within between the points A and B so in this case if you do an overlap box it won't just as this position and return false but if you were to do a box cast it would start from here and move a virtual box onto this direction and it would find this wall in the middle so that would really turn true because it would indeed find something so that is the difference between those two if you had a big distance and you want to make sure like for example for a a bullet if you want to fire a bullet you don't want to just test on point a and point B you want to test if there's a Wong or a character or anything in between point a and point B because the bullet is probably going to move a ton of distance between one frame and the other one so for a bullet you really want to do a cast instead of just an overlap because you want to test if there's anything in between the two points so that is the difference between those two and definitely knowing those differences are very important and once again it's over here on the FAQ on the website so if you're following the course definitely make sure you check the website page okay right recommend paying your model or musician or attempt to find somebody for free I mean I guess depends on what is your goal if you're trying to make games commercially then yeah you should definitely pay for for the essence but if you're doing it just for fun just as a hobby then yeah definitely find someone who also wants to we also want to try out their improving their modeling skills and build the game together with no goal of profit so pretty much depends on your goals both can definitely work my custom character yep let me just check this out so let me refresh the page which actually takes a little bit but okay so let's see I can't speak of any English very because I'm from Egypt but I can understand some words alright that's awesome I mean we always uh it's always a learning process for me I learned English by watching Cartoon Network as a kid that's pretty much how I learned so yeah so yeah if you're here if you can understand a few things and yep over time you will definitely learn more and more so yeah just keep exposing yourself to English things yeah you will eventually learn that's how I learned so yeah uh okay so I'm just checking the the validation thing trying to see yeah I really need to update this code because it's quite a bit slow uh I'm just looking at things uh so far okay there's a bunch of okay so let me validate these new characters okay so I'm validating a bunch of them by the way there are some that uh some people have included custom characters but they did not link their YouTube account so some of these won't show up but the others should let me just update the character customization so that should be updating now I hope there you go there's a nice new custom character so there you go if you just joined recently so you can draw on your own character make your own character and let me just where's my chat what's my chat there you go like that you can follow the tutorial in order to customize it and so on there you go another nice custom character Never Their CPU with a nice character anyone else there's me with a nice character and there you go Timbo Jones with nice Rayman and anyone else there was a SpiderMan a while ago no I guess no more all right okay okay how'd you manage to pay the bills while making games you mentioned never worth nine to five well I mean first of all it helps that I live in Portugal where there's a relative low cost of living so when I started I could make a living on something like six or seven hundred bucks so by the time that I was also well the more important thing is I was living with my parents until I made enough money with my games to move out so that's the first thing so I was making games for there you go SpiderMan's back uh yeah so I was making uh flash games for about five years and I was still living with my parents because that couldn't pay enough but yeah by the end I was already making about five or six hundred bucks a month and then I went on to see him and that started actually making some decent money so yeah pretty much the answer is low cost of living plus living with parents plus having a nice ramp up of experience so for about five years that I was making games I wasn't really making enough so that's pretty much it Super Chat thank you do you have any predictions on when multiplayer won't come out I I'm hoping by the end of this month but honestly I don't know I mean I I've done a bunch of research I've done a little bit of the Prototype but yeah they're still still a lot of work to do I still got to research a lot more I still gotta finish the Prototype then I got it right on the lectures and I gotta record them then I gotta edit them and then finally publish them so I'm hoping I can do all of that within this month so maybe on the last week of this month or maybe the first or second week of March so I don't know but yeah hopefully hopefully it won't be too long hopefully all right great and there we go uh all right okay so let's go on to the next question so where was I okay so let's go with this one so this is a fun one uh yeah it's almost dinner time so I'm going to have to close in a little bit okay bye okay so let's just go into the next one all right so there you go brand new question so this one is on lecture 15. so let's see lecture 15 that is the one on the selected count original any Singleton okay so what is the cause of the flickering bug and let me actually show that book that I mean uh oh boy I need that uh is it two objects don't worry about the time I'm going to yeah because I actually need to uh let me just make a quick a quick testing scene yeah because I probably should have prepared the testing scenes beforehand uh just need to pick up something okay oh okay uh trying to oh boy it didn't yeah I didn't plan this this demo ahead of time so me like this like this just select a different material anything duh boy oh actually oh because I remember that I saw this a little bit uh yeah sorry for the a bit of chaos right now I'm yeah because I did now I can't find it uh where's my where's my I'm trying to find something and I can't find it there you go that's the one there you go okay so that's the that's the bug that I want to show Okay so let's go in here so there you go look at this look at this flick ring so this is what I mean so what is the cause of this flickering bug where the texture is smiggling back and forth so is it that two objects are on the mathematically exact position is the GPU broken or is it a physics solution so there you go this is debug so if all of you if some of you didn't know what I mean by that go ahead and vote and let me look at chat yeah this one is a bit tricky and oh boy there's even a fully ring over here yeah someone over there does have the the right answer there you go oh boy let me end this because this flickering is driving me crazy and yep the answer is indeed a it is two objects are on the mathematically exact position or like these people mention more the more technical term is Z fighting so it's more in the Z buffer so basically since this quad is literally on position where's the position there you go it's literally on zero just like the floor object these two are on the exact same thing so this is a very nasty visual issue so if you have this one solution is super simple literally just put this a tiny bit off there you go just like this just by moving it by 0.01 and now no longer got the problem so Yep this is called Z fighting because both are on the exact same depth so that is what makes it quite annoying so if you have that now you know just make sure that one of the objects is not on the exact perfect position and everything will be nice and fixed all right okay so that was a bit a bit tricky to set up the demo I guess next time I gotta prepare demos ahead of time okay do you have a Discord Channel I don't but uh CPU over here has a nice Discord channel so if you want to it's called United programming so just found it find it in Discord so if you want Discord go ahead on there basically I tried having a Discord and didn't work because I'm already insanely busy trying to answer all the comments course questions emails all those things it is always super difficult to keep up so I really couldn't keep up with one more thing especially since Discord is real time so that is why I couldn't do it alright so thank you so much for the Super Chat and got another one did not get the YouTube notification arrive late oh well this one's going to be saved and this one is hopefully a bit educational so hopefully for people who are catching this after a while so hopefully that's nice yeah stream announcements post on Discord hope you have a great time thank you uh there is an email on the website so if you log in if you go into your user page you can sign up to be notified and yeah it won't send that okay all right so let me do a bunch more questions because it's already 6 30 so I gotta stop in a little bit okay so let's see this one this one is a a fun one so let me copy the options that one and that one and down all right so there you go another question this one is related to lecture 18 so that is an electron player pickup and csharp interface so the question how many interfaces and base classes can a class implement or extend so is it a multiple interfaces but only one base less or is it being a multiple base less but only one interface or is it c as many as you want so if you got basses and interfaces how many can you implement slash extend so what team and thank you so much talks for the Super Chat thank you another one cute oh boy there's even more cue thank you so much sorry if I I miss them yeah I'm trying to keep up with everything uh subhari yeah that's a nice name thank you for everything you do for asking you hey thank you for the Super Chat and thanks for being here yeah I mean these live streams really it's a twoway thing so it only works if I'm here and if all of you are here watching so thank you all so much for being here on this random is it using I don't even know what day it is it is using right yeah I think so uh yeah so so thank you all for being here when I make every correct answer it's not exactly I think I did try to yeah I tried to change it a little bit so yeah uh your program C sharp for living that to think about it for a second yeah I mean that that is a perfectly natural thing even for me I've been making games programming and using entity for so long and if there's still many things that I have to use my brain think for a little bit so yeah so much for the videos you make that's awesome all right so yeah it seems there's literally nobody else on the other one so if I end the quiz and in the quiz any up there you go it is indeed correct so basically you can Implement multiple interfaces but you can only extend one base less that is one of the limitations and one of the reasons why you should use interfaces over base classes and also inheritance is always a I talk about that in actually don't remember which one is it on the kitchen object but I don't know I talk about it on the on the course about the issues with inheritance and how it can definitely become quite tricky quite quickly so it is something that you can use because it is a very powerful thing but definitely you have to be careful when you use them whereas with interface personally I'm a huge fan of interface I think they are awesome especially since with uh so C sharp 7 you can use default implementations so that means you can write an interface and actually write the code so if you don't know what I'm talking about here's a quick test so instead of making a public class you can make it an interface so I my interface you can do this and then inside you can have a function my function and do something and then on a class you would implement this interface and again as it says on the question you can Implement multiple interface both of the csharp 7 you can also do something awesome which is over here you can do a default implementation so if you have an interface and already have a bunch of objects that Implement that interface and you want to add something new you can add a default implementation and everything won't work perfectly so you don't have to actually add the implementation but you can if you want to so interface are super awesome for example if you got a game and some objects have an inventory and some objects don't you can use an interface to say I has enter I has inventory and Implement that interface on any object that has an inventory so interface are super powerful and there is something that I definitely use quite a lot in the course and I've got a dedicated video on them so if you don't know about interfaces definitely watch the course and then definitely watch that video okay so yeah another awesome thing so I hope some of you are learning something new from this even though I'm looking on the side most people got 100 right so I'm not sure maybe I should have made the questions quite a bit harder maybe okay uh all right so let's do one more and then I think that's gonna be it because my voice already messed up how did you sell your first games well my first games were made with flash and back with flash that was uh basically it was sponsoring so basically a a company a sponsor would uh pay the flash developer and then it would show up a logo of that company with a link to the website and so on so usually those were flashy importance so I would make a game I would put it on a website for selling flash games then a company who contacted me say we'll give you 300 bucks if you put the link the logo with our custom animation and so on yeah pretty much kind of like a publisher that's that's kind of what they did yeah they had the game portals so for example a lot of you probably already know armor games so that was one of the big ones back then yeah pretty much uh okay right so thank you so much for the Super Chat and there's another one oh boy there's even more I'm sorry I'm trying to keep up uh Olivia I'm assistant engineer and thinking of going into coding games on a task apart from coding for your games did you work as a coder somewhere else and nope the answer is nope I didn't I pretty much just I've never had a regular job so if any of you have questions with regards to finding a job in the industry I am not the right person to to answer about that because yeah I've never had a a job anywhere else doing anything else although I have done a lot of things by myself so I've done some some regular applications I've done some websites a bunch of things so I have done a lot of things but not professionally and professionally making games that's pretty much the only thing I've ever done so thanks so much only VA for the super Channel thanks so much another one whatever you're saying and is it was this a hey yeah because my overlay does not support the what is it called the stickers I don't know but thank you so much Tech vir Singh Is that how you pronounce it that's a nice name nice chess lab that's one uh okay so let me put another question here so one more question okay so this one is hopefully a bit trickier so let's see this one how it goes okay so this one is actually related to lecture 14. so this one about csharp events and C sharp events you use something called a function signature so the question is what is a function signature so is it a the function name is it B the return type and parameter types or is it C the return type the function name the parameter types and parameter names so which one of these is correct so which one of these relates to the function signature so let's see go ahead and start to vote and let's see you should probably add a nice clock what is that oh boy now I don't remember countdown is that the thing the British game show which has a a nice timer with a nice sound that was fun uh uh all right so there you go lots of votes I didn't even see it's gonna be funny looking at this uh the chat rate for this for this stream is quite interesting lots of spikes lots of things anyways uh yeah all right it's countdown I only know countdown because of the skit on on uh the IT Crowd that was really funny where Moss becomes really hardcore into countdown becomes a famous person within that Circle that was fun all right okay so people are voting seems the majority thinks that it's C the return type the function name the parameter types and the parameter names how do you make better character design I mean that's an art question so I am definitely not the right person to teach about art so yep nice to netenba uh that was really funny yeah I still I still memorize the uh what's it called the the replacement to 999 what's that one oh one one eight nine nine nine eight eight one nine five nine one one nine oh God no I forgot 723 oh God no I forgot the last numbers uh anyway that was fun okay uh I had a spin pen like you you search for pen tricks and so on and that's uh what's a b bone not Super Chat cute thank you so much hey CPU it's live quiz seems to be very fun thanks for doing them yeah this was a fun idea that I had and so far it's working great I mean this is a UNT window and so far it hasn't crashed everything is working so yeah I'm very I'm very pleased with this so if all of you are enjoying this I will hopefully be doing more in the future all right so yeah the function signature so let's go ahead and end the quiz and let's see which one is the correct answer and for this one I really need a drum roll so I should probably have a drum roll and there you go and there you go the answer is B so now the majority was actually wrong for the first time wow that is interesting so yep the answer is B for the function signature what matters is the return type and the parameter types meaning that the function name and the parameter names that does not matter so you can have a function with different names different parameter names as long as the types are correct that is the one thing that really does matter all right so look at that yeah for this one I won yeah that definitely got a bunch of people off 100 so there you go rookie at 100 with 16 right answers what do I win I'm not sure I should probably come up with some prizes some things yeah remember that from here download gets video yeah that's nice awesome yeah because that is for delegates so if uh some of you don't know what I'm talking about for example let's make over here a delegate my delegate returns an INT an INT and has a string for some kind of parameter and now I can make a private void uh up right and my function with a string my string and this one is a function return minus one just to get rid of that error and basically over here this function does match this delegate signature so basically what matters is the return time so they both return end and they both have a string parameter now the actual name the delegate does not have to match and the actual name of the parameter also does not have to match so if I make a private a field of type my delegates so my delegate field if I do this I can do my delegate equals my function and yep there you go that does work because this one does have the exact same signature as that delegate so they both return in they both have a string and it does not matter that this one is called parameter over here is my string that does not matter for the function signature all that matters are the types of this so yeah look at that so A bunch of you actually got it wrong so that was fun so that means that a bunch of you uh learned something new so hopefully that is the positive takeaway so nice training your streams are so creative yeah thank you so much thank you for the super Channel thank you for being here thank you for watching that is fun another Super Chat you and there's even more Hey whenever you have time search and watch this video speed up compile times in unity with assembly definitions yeah I do have a lecture about assembly definitions on my ultimate TNT overview course so this one who made that is that a a oh look at that there it is live right now that's one uh oh times in UNT with simile definitions is this an official oh it's the one from Game Dev guide yep definitely assembly definitions if you have problems with compilation time definitely use them basically that's one way that you can split your code into multiple assemblies so if you modify just one line of code on one file you won't actually recompile the entire game which if you don't use assembly definitions and that's what happens you modify a single file and it won't recompile every single file whereas if you use assembly definitions by modifying one file will only recompile that assembly so if you have a huge code base it can still be really fast to compile as long as it's nicely separated into different assemblies on different parts so whenever you modify something only that assembly gets recompiled so if you use tons tons of them then even on a huge project it can definitely be super fast all right so yeah thanks for sharing for that tip so those of you who don't know similar definitions definitely watch this video Game Dev guide usually has great videos or if you have my ultimately in the overview of course I also have a lecture on that so yeah that is really awesome thank you not Super Chat tuned sorry about the name or your tutorials yeah that's great make journal series on how to host your multiplayer game using unity's new cloud game server hosting multiplayer yep that is definitely one of the things that I do want to cover I'm hoping to cover that on the upcoming multiplayer course and I'm also hopefully hoping to make a separate tutorial just on that subject so yeah that is definitely something that I definitely want to cover although I haven't done any research yet so I'm not sure I'm not sure when but yep definitely on the plan definitely something that I want to do so thank you so much not a super chat okay winner can choose a video idea I mean that would be a fun one a fun prize but I already have way too much work so I'm not sure that would be very doable I think if I made that the price I'm not sure I could guarantee that I would end up making it so yeah that would be fun but yeah I've got I have to say like a video ideas definitely something that I don't have I've got a billion things that I wish I could make if only I could clone myself so that I could work on 10 different ideas at the same time I'd love to do that so yeah that would be that would be fun thank you so much another Super Chat yeah there you go choose a video idea that would be fun so yeah thank you so much all right okay so that was a a fun question all right so I think that's gonna be it because I'm already my voice is already pretty messed up I can't talk way too much some people are at 100 last question yeah the 100 is just questions uh answers versus the total so yeah so for example over here barricade answered 15 and got 15 right even though there were apparently at least 16 questions so yeah that's the the percentage is not percentage of total questions it's answered versus correct okay all right so I think that's gonna be it I need to go eat something drink something and my dogs are okay all right okay so I think that is gonna be it okay so let me just put this I'm Gonna Leave This on for a little bit and then let's see all right so let me just organize everything and it is correct all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here on this live stream this was a different thing it was an experiment and well so far it went pretty well so I'm pretty happy with how it went so hopefully all of you enjoyed it so hopefully a bit more in the in the future so my plan for this year is definitely doing a bunch more live streams and experiment with different things kind of like this so hopefully you enjoyed it so thank you all so much for being here so let me just prepare things and I gotta go like this all right all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here thank you so much and I'll see you next time foreign thank you thank you foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign
