With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - 2023 is finally here and for some of you
00:05 - hopefully that means you decided to make
00:06 - this year you finally publish your first
00:08 - game here are some of my tips for how
00:11 - you can achieve that or how to set goals
00:13 - in general and in the end I will also
00:15 - talk about my own personal goals both as
00:17 - a steam Game Dev as well as YouTube and
00:19 - some more personal goals setting actual
00:21 - clear goals is one of the best things
00:23 - you can do for yourself
00:24 - having clear goals is kind of like
00:26 - driving on a race track you can see
00:27 - where the track goes and you know that
00:29 - if you keep following the track you will
00:31 - reach the end whereas with our goals
00:33 - it's kind of like driving in the desert
00:34 - there's no clear indication where you're
00:36 - going maybe you're going forwards or
00:37 - maybe not I'm pretty sure there have
00:39 - been some studies that show how just
00:41 - writing down your goals massively
00:42 - increase your chances of success so if
00:44 - there is something you really want to do
00:45 - like for example on punish your first
00:47 - game then take some time to write down a
00:49 - clear goal something that I personally
00:51 - find very useful is setting smart goals
00:53 - that's an acronym the S is for specific
00:57 - meaning defining clear numbers or
00:59 - actions rather than vague descriptions
01:00 - like for example launch a game on Steam
01:03 - DM is measurable meaning you can measure
01:06 - progress and completion like for example
01:08 - you've completed 10 out of 20 Mechanics
01:10 - for your game
01:11 - the A is for achievable meaning
01:13 - something you can actually achieve so
01:15 - don't set a goal like I want to build
01:17 - Call of Duty or World of Warcraft by
01:19 - myself if you're working solo make sure
01:21 - you select a project that is doable by a
01:23 - solo developer with your skill set Dr is
01:26 - for Relevant meaning goals that make
01:28 - sense to you for example multiplayer
01:30 - games do tend to do very well but if you
01:32 - don't like playing and making single
01:34 - player games then build that build what
01:36 - makes sense to you rather than chasing
01:37 - just what is popular and the T is for
01:39 - time bound meaning there should be a
01:41 - time limit on the goal for example
01:43 - launch your first game on scene by June
01:45 - 23. personally I find This Acronym to be
01:48 - extremely useful whenever I have
01:49 - something that I want to do I always
01:51 - think back to it for some clear steps
01:52 - actually made a really great video all
01:54 - the way back in 2020 so the video is
01:56 - three years old but the content in the
01:58 - video is really Timeless it's just as
02:00 - valid today as it was back then I even
02:02 - renamed that video just now so it's
02:04 - titled 7 steps to become a game
02:06 - developer in 2023 go watch that video to
02:09 - see a clearly defined path for how you
02:10 - can achieve article here's a super quick
02:13 - summary
02:14 - first build a bunch of super small games
02:16 - to get acquainted with the tools then
02:18 - watch some basic and also intermediate
02:20 - tutorials on both unity and c-sharp this
02:22 - step helps you familiarize yourself with
02:24 - exactly what is possible
02:26 - after that create a very simple game
02:28 - it's very important that it's a complete
02:30 - Game meaning something playable from
02:32 - start to finish so it's not a prototype
02:34 - then read the excellent book clean code
02:36 - and research clean code principles this
02:39 - will improve your skills as developer
02:40 - and programmer tenfold then make a three
02:42 - month game and very importantly publish
02:44 - it on the steam or the App Store this
02:46 - will help you learn the process of
02:47 - actually launching a game and getting
02:49 - player reviews after that read and study
02:52 - code complete this is another excellent
02:54 - book it's even more detailed than clean
02:56 - code it won't really help solidify your
02:59 - knowledge of clean code which will
03:00 - massively help you build any game you
03:02 - can imagine and finally make and publish
03:04 - a complete 6 month game you can follow
03:06 - all these steps in one year and if you
03:08 - do then in 2024 you won't look back and
03:10 - be amazed at how much you've grown
03:11 - definitely go watch that video to see
03:13 - all of these steps in detail like I said
03:15 - the advice in that is really Timeless
03:16 - that clear path is just as applicable
03:19 - now as it was back then and it will
03:20 - still be applicable many years from now
03:22 - now one thing that a lot of people
03:23 - struggle with is actually a word that I
03:25 - really don't like that is motivation I
03:27 - seen lots of comments like that on these
03:29 - kinds of Game Dev goals videos there's
03:31 - only tons of people saying how do you
03:32 - keep working on a game when you lose
03:34 - motivation personally I don't think you
03:36 - should rely on motivation at all the
03:37 - reason is because that word that feeling
03:39 - is not really in your control it comes
03:41 - and goes it's very random instead of
03:42 - motivation what you should do is you
03:44 - should rely on self-discipline which you
03:46 - can control so my advice to you is if
03:48 - this is something you truly want to do
03:49 - then go ahead and do it regardless if
03:51 - you feel motivated or not treated it
03:53 - with a seriousness that you feel about
03:55 - Disco If you really want to do it then
03:57 - go do it whether you feel like it or not
03:59 - I know that sounds overly simplistic but
04:01 - that really is the only way there's no
04:02 - magic on way to suddenly create a burst
04:04 - of motivation from thin air when you
04:06 - don't feel like it there are times when
04:08 - Game Dev is hard even if you don't love
04:09 - the game you're making there will be
04:11 - Parts you don't like for example for me
04:13 - I hate making trailers but if I want to
04:15 - launch my game I know I have to make it
04:17 - I also hate worrying about music and
04:19 - sound effects but again if I want to
04:21 - achieve my goal of completing the game
04:22 - then I have to push through those parts
04:24 - I don't want to do any of those but I
04:26 - know they have to to be done so I know
04:27 - the only way is to push through it one
04:29 - person whose content has helped me out a
04:31 - lot in my own personal journey is Brian
04:32 - Tracy specifically his talks on
04:34 - self-discipline the best way I've heard
04:36 - described is very simple self-discipline
04:38 - is the ability to make yourself do all
04:40 - the things you know you need to do
04:41 - whether you feel like it or not so if
04:43 - making a game is truly a goal you do
04:45 - want to achieve then don't rely on
04:47 - motivation instead remember this quote
04:49 - remember self-discipline is difficult
04:51 - but it is within your control if you
04:53 - want some more practical tips on
04:54 - day-to-day scheduling then another great
04:56 - video was one I made in the beginning of
04:58 - 2021 everything changed it's all about
05:00 - my 8 tips for working from home
05:02 - effectively you obviously need to adapt
05:04 - into your own life depending on how much
05:05 - time you have to dedicate the Game Dev
05:07 - but in general those steps should help
05:08 - and I feel curious to know my own goals
05:10 - for 2023 the first one is something I've
05:13 - already spoken about I want to launch my
05:15 - next team game tournamental Liberation I
05:16 - want to launch it this year the plan is
05:18 - in Q3 so hopefully around July August
05:21 - and this is also a good point to mention
05:22 - how the amount of detail you need in
05:24 - defining steps for your goals really
05:26 - depends on on your own level of
05:27 - experience with whatever you're trying
05:28 - to do for example in my case I don't
05:30 - necessarily need a super detailed
05:32 - step-by-step guide to launch my game
05:33 - this is something I've done many times
05:35 - so it's something I already know how to
05:37 - do even though scope is always very
05:38 - tricky to get right even with a lot of
05:40 - experience I do believe the design that
05:42 - I want to build is doable in this time
05:43 - frame given my skill set so to achieve
05:46 - this goal launch this game I don't have
05:47 - a super detailed step-by-step guide I
05:49 - have a list of mechanics that I need to
05:51 - build and the belief that I'll be able
05:52 - to build them within the time limit
05:53 - another very important goal is one that
05:55 - was actually delayed it's building a
05:57 - complete free course on making a game
05:59 - and making it multiplayer initially this
06:01 - gun was meant to be completed in last
06:03 - December it was meant to be a much
06:05 - simpler game but the scope kind of got
06:06 - out of hand so it was delayed all the
06:08 - way to January now I'm aiming for mid to
06:11 - late January it will be a complete free
06:13 - about 10 hour course on making a
06:15 - complete multiplayer game from start to
06:17 - finish I'm really happy with how it's
06:18 - coming out so I can't wait to finish it
06:20 - and hear what you won't think then
06:21 - another gone for this year is something
06:23 - I've been waiting for ages Unity dots
06:25 - should be if only released around on
06:26 - March April so around that time I want
06:29 - to make a really detailed course on
06:30 - making a game using Unity dots I'm
06:32 - really excited about this tool set and
06:34 - all the kinds of games that can be built
06:35 - and that will be built over the coming
06:37 - years so I can't wait to explore that
06:39 - area during this year those are my three
06:41 - very clear goals for this year for some
06:43 - more soft goals I would like to do a
06:45 - bunch more live streams I always enjoy
06:47 - doing these but at the same time I'm not
06:49 - really a very social person so being on
06:50 - camera takes a ton of energy for me just
06:52 - like with game development in general
06:54 - this is a question all about experience
06:55 - I know the more I do them the easier it
06:57 - will be so I do want to do some more
06:59 - another goal is really just keeping the
07:00 - status quo I always aim for publishing
07:02 - three videos per week sometimes too this
07:05 - year since I have those really complex
07:06 - goals of making a game and two courses
07:08 - it won't be tricky to stick to that
07:10 - schedule but I will try my best in order
07:12 - to achieve that goal of keeping the same
07:13 - rate of videos one of my most important
07:15 - goals this year is finally hiring an
07:17 - editor so far I've been wearing this
07:18 - channel for almost 5 years and it's
07:20 - always been just me writing recording
07:22 - editing doing everything so I've
07:24 - recently experimented with hiring some
07:25 - editors if you see seen the video on is
07:27 - Game Dev all about luck that one is the
07:29 - first video on this channel not edited
07:31 - by me hopefully hiring an editor won't
07:33 - give me some more time that I can focus
07:34 - on doing the things that I actually want
07:36 - to do and the things that I'm actually
07:37 - good at I want to do those things rather
07:39 - than doing editing which I don't enjoy
07:41 - and I'm not good at and for some fun
07:43 - YouTube goals I'd love to hit 500k Subs
07:46 - that would mean 85k subs this year which
07:48 - is definitely doable and for another
07:50 - round number I'd love to hit 50 million
07:52 - total views which would also mean about
07:54 - 18 million views this year that would be
07:56 - something like 40 growth from last year
07:58 - which would be pretty insane so this is
07:59 - one of those moonshot goals even if I
08:01 - miss it I will still be quite happy
08:03 - these are my work related goals and for
08:05 - me something that is absolutely
08:07 - essential to my life is Fitness I
08:09 - generally could not do everything that I
08:10 - do without working out that really is
08:12 - the main reason that I've been able to
08:13 - work non-sav for the past about seven
08:15 - years without suffering burnout I don't
08:17 - have Vacations or holidays or even
08:19 - weekends I work every single day about 8
08:22 - to 10 hours per day the only way that
08:23 - I'm able to do that is because well
08:25 - first of all I have my dogs I really
08:27 - love them and because of them I take
08:28 - regular breaks to take them on wonks
08:30 - that really helps and every day I also
08:33 - make a break to go to the gym to work
08:34 - out so related to that my personal
08:36 - fitness goals are to hit a new deadlift
08:38 - PR I injured my back about a year ago so
08:40 - 22 was mostly doing Physio and just
08:42 - recuperating now that I'm back to normal
08:44 - I'd love to hit a new PR this year my
08:46 - Max deadlift was 185 kilos so I'd love
08:48 - to beat that obviously all while
08:50 - focusing on safety first same thing on
08:52 - the bench press I had to do some
08:54 - shoulder physio so I had to phone back
08:55 - for a few months but now back to normal
08:57 - my Max was 110 kilos and I'd love to
08:59 - beat that lately I've been running quite
09:01 - a lot just recently did a 10k run in 48
09:04 - minutes which for me is insanely fast
09:06 - the best I've ever done now I'd love to
09:08 - train to be able to do a 20K run and
09:10 - finally get down to about 10 body fat
09:12 - just briefly just to see what my button
09:14 - looks like personally I have a lot of
09:15 - trouble with food control I have a huge
09:17 - appetite so this is definitely a tough
09:19 - one and one that I've actually quote
09:21 - unquote filmed every year for many years
09:22 - my advice to you is make some kind of
09:25 - Fitness part of your life you don't
09:26 - don't have to take it as seriously as I
09:28 - do personally I love it so I work out a
09:29 - ton but you don't have to do it as
09:31 - intensely as I do but whatever you do
09:33 - definitely make sure you do something
09:34 - sitting for 16 hours a day is really not
09:36 - good if you want to do this for a long
09:38 - time if you want to still be making
09:39 - games in your 70s then definitely take
09:41 - care of your health and fitness find out
09:43 - what works for you what you like maybe
09:45 - you don't like running maybe biking
09:47 - maybe dancing maybe bodybuilding maybe
09:49 - power lifting maybe football whatever it
09:51 - is find something Fitness related you
09:53 - like and do it take some breaks go out
09:54 - on walks and drink plenty of water also
09:56 - speaking of goals related to my fitness
09:58 - journey here's a funny story I know
10:00 - exactly when I started taking Fitness
10:01 - seriously I know that because it was
10:03 - exactly when I said a clear goal and I
10:05 - know exactly what caused me to have that
10:07 - click in my brain it was a video on
10:09 - featuring physics Channel he was
10:11 - embarking on his one-year journey of
10:12 - competing in a bodybu only show and he
10:14 - clearly outlined the plan to achieve his
10:16 - goal What specifically got me was when
10:18 - he talked about the clear plan with
10:19 - regards to macros how many grams of
10:21 - protein how many carbs and fats how many
10:23 - calories total and how the plan would
10:25 - change over time when I saw that white
10:27 - board that's when something clicked in
10:28 - my head after that I finally developed a
10:30 - clear plan until then I was learning
10:32 - about Fitness but I wasn't really
10:33 - following a clear plan I wasn't really
10:35 - paying attention to calories or macros
10:37 - or training splits but at that point I
10:39 - wrote down and defined the clear steps
10:41 - to achieve my goals for the next six
10:42 - months I tracked every food that I
10:44 - consumed and every workout doing that
10:46 - really helped me reach my fitness goals
10:48 - it was all because of that one video and
10:50 - that link in my brain so hopefully this
10:52 - video of mine will trigger that click in
10:54 - at least some of you which will
10:55 - hopefully mean that perhaps years from
10:57 - now you can look back on this video and
10:59 - remember that it was this video that
11:00 - made you set your goals and finally
11:02 - achieve them lastly on the topic of
11:03 - goals let me point out one very
11:05 - important thing setting goals is
11:07 - excellent just by clearly defining some
11:09 - goals you're already doing great and
11:11 - setting ambitious goals that are just
11:12 - slightly Out Of Reach is also excellent
11:14 - however when you eventually don't
11:16 - achieve one goal it is also extremely
11:18 - important not to be too harsh on
11:19 - yourself setting a goal is meant to be a
11:21 - positive thing something that will help
11:22 - you achieve whatever it is you want but
11:24 - if you then punish yourself because it
11:26 - didn't personally achieved it well then
11:28 - at that point it's a case of going one
11:29 - step forward and two steps back for
11:31 - example my own goal of launching third
11:33 - one Liberation by Q3 of this year I
11:35 - believe I can achieve that goal but also
11:36 - know it won't be challenging so there's
11:38 - a chance that I will quote unquote fail
11:40 - that goal and I might have to delay the
11:43 - game possibly to only launch it in
11:44 - January or February of 24 if that
11:47 - happens that will definitely suck but
11:48 - hopefully I won't be strong enough to
11:50 - not be too hard on myself because that
11:51 - would just not help at all if that does
11:53 - happen I hope I can take a deep breath
11:55 - and just keep working the plan so
11:57 - remember even if you quote unquote fail
11:58 - to achieve your goal you're still
12:00 - probably going to be better off than if
12:02 - you'd never Define the goal at all
12:03 - there's that quote shoot for the moon
12:05 - and even if you miss you will still land
12:06 - Among the Stars now go ahead write down
12:09 - a clear plan and make this year you
12:11 - finally achieve your goal with making
12:12 - and Publishing your game I wish you the
12:14 - absolute best of luck in your game Dev
12:16 - Journey

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey 2023 is finally here and for some of you hopefully that means you decided to make this year you finally publish your first game here are some of my tips for how you can achieve that or how to set goals in general and in the end I will also talk about my own personal goals both as a steam Game Dev as well as YouTube and some more personal goals setting actual clear goals is one of the best things you can do for yourself having clear goals is kind of like driving on a race track you can see where the track goes and you know that if you keep following the track you will reach the end whereas with our goals it's kind of like driving in the desert there's no clear indication where you're going maybe you're going forwards or maybe not I'm pretty sure there have been some studies that show how just writing down your goals massively increase your chances of success so if there is something you really want to do like for example on punish your first game then take some time to write down a clear goal something that I personally find very useful is setting smart goals that's an acronym the S is for specific meaning defining clear numbers or actions rather than vague descriptions like for example launch a game on Steam DM is measurable meaning you can measure progress and completion like for example you've completed 10 out of 20 Mechanics for your game the A is for achievable meaning something you can actually achieve so don't set a goal like I want to build Call of Duty or World of Warcraft by myself if you're working solo make sure you select a project that is doable by a solo developer with your skill set Dr is for Relevant meaning goals that make sense to you for example multiplayer games do tend to do very well but if you don't like playing and making single player games then build that build what makes sense to you rather than chasing just what is popular and the T is for time bound meaning there should be a time limit on the goal for example launch your first game on scene by June 23. personally I find This Acronym to be extremely useful whenever I have something that I want to do I always think back to it for some clear steps actually made a really great video all the way back in 2020 so the video is three years old but the content in the video is really Timeless it's just as valid today as it was back then I even renamed that video just now so it's titled 7 steps to become a game developer in 2023 go watch that video to see a clearly defined path for how you can achieve article here's a super quick summary first build a bunch of super small games to get acquainted with the tools then watch some basic and also intermediate tutorials on both unity and csharp this step helps you familiarize yourself with exactly what is possible after that create a very simple game it's very important that it's a complete Game meaning something playable from start to finish so it's not a prototype then read the excellent book clean code and research clean code principles this will improve your skills as developer and programmer tenfold then make a three month game and very importantly publish it on the steam or the App Store this will help you learn the process of actually launching a game and getting player reviews after that read and study code complete this is another excellent book it's even more detailed than clean code it won't really help solidify your knowledge of clean code which will massively help you build any game you can imagine and finally make and publish a complete 6 month game you can follow all these steps in one year and if you do then in 2024 you won't look back and be amazed at how much you've grown definitely go watch that video to see all of these steps in detail like I said the advice in that is really Timeless that clear path is just as applicable now as it was back then and it will still be applicable many years from now now one thing that a lot of people struggle with is actually a word that I really don't like that is motivation I seen lots of comments like that on these kinds of Game Dev goals videos there's only tons of people saying how do you

described is very simple selfdiscipline is the ability to make yourself do all the things you know you need to do whether you feel like it or not so if making a game is truly a goal you do want to achieve then don't rely on motivation instead remember this quote remember selfdiscipline is difficult but it is within your control if you want some more practical tips on daytoday scheduling then another great video was one I made in the beginning of 2021 everything changed it's all about my 8 tips for working from home effectively you obviously need to adapt into your own life depending on how much time you have to dedicate the Game Dev but in general those steps should help and I feel curious to know my own goals for 2023 the first one is something I've already spoken about I want to launch my next team game tournamental Liberation I want to launch it this year the plan is in Q3 so hopefully around July August and this is also a good point to mention how the amount of detail you need in defining steps for your goals really depends on on your own level of experience with whatever you're trying to do for example in my case I don't necessarily need a super detailed stepbystep guide to launch my game this is something I've done many times so it's something I already know how to do even though scope is always very tricky to get right even with a lot of experience I do believe the design that I want to build is doable in this time frame given my skill set so to achieve this goal launch this game I don't have a super detailed stepbystep guide I have a list of mechanics that I need to build and the belief that I'll be able to build them within the time limit another very important goal is one that was actually delayed it's building a complete free course on making a game and making it multiplayer initially this gun was meant to be completed in last December it was meant to be a much simpler game but the scope kind of got out of hand so it was delayed all the way to January now I'm aiming for mid to late January it will be a complete free about 10 hour course on making a complete multiplayer game from start to finish I'm really happy with how it's coming out so I can't wait to finish it and hear what you won't think then another gone for this year is something I've been waiting for ages Unity dots should be if only released around on March April so around that time I want to make a really detailed course on making a game using Unity dots I'm really excited about this tool set and all the kinds of games that can be built and that will be built over the coming years so I can't wait to explore that area during this year those are my three very clear goals for this year for some more soft goals I would like to do a bunch more live streams I always enjoy doing these but at the same time I'm not really a very social person so being on camera takes a ton of energy for me just like with game development in general this is a question all about experience I know the more I do them the easier it will be so I do want to do some more another goal is really just keeping the status quo I always aim for publishing three videos per week sometimes too this year since I have those really complex goals of making a game and two courses it won't be tricky to stick to that schedule but I will try my best in order to achieve that goal of keeping the same rate of videos one of my most important goals this year is finally hiring an editor so far I've been wearing this channel for almost 5 years and it's always been just me writing recording editing doing everything so I've recently experimented with hiring some editors if you see seen the video on is Game Dev all about luck that one is the first video on this channel not edited by me hopefully hiring an editor won't give me some more time that I can focus on doing the things that I actually want to do and the things that I'm actually good at I want to do those things rather than doing editing which I don't enjoy and I'm not good at and for some fun YouTube goals I'd love to hit 500k Subs that would mean 85k subs this year which is definitely doable and for another round number I'd love to hit 50 million total views which would also mean about 18 million views this year that would be something like 40 growth from last year which would be pretty insane so this is one of those moonshot goals even if I miss it I will still be quite happy these are my work related goals and for me something that is absolutely essential to my life is Fitness I generally could not do everything that I do without working out that really is the main reason that I've been able to work nonsav for the past about seven years without suffering burnout I don't have Vacations or holidays or even weekends I work every single day about 8 to 10 hours per day the only way that I'm able to do that is because well first of all I have my dogs I really love them and because of them I take regular breaks to take them on wonks that really helps and every day I also make a break to go to the gym to work out so related to that my personal fitness goals are to hit a new deadlift PR I injured my back about a year ago so 22 was mostly doing Physio and just recuperating now that I'm back to normal I'd love to hit a new PR this year my Max deadlift was 185 kilos so I'd love to beat that obviously all while focusing on safety first same thing on the bench press I had to do some shoulder physio so I had to phone back for a few months but now back to normal my Max was 110 kilos and I'd love to beat that lately I've been running quite a lot just recently did a 10k run in 48 minutes which for me is insanely fast the best I've ever done now I'd love to train to be able to do a 20K run and finally get down to about 10 body fat just briefly just to see what my button looks like personally I have a lot of trouble with food control I have a huge appetite so this is definitely a tough one and one that I've actually quote unquote filmed every year for many years my advice to you is make some kind of Fitness part of your life you don't don't have to take it as seriously as I do personally I love it so I work out a ton but you don't have to do it as intensely as I do but whatever you do definitely make sure you do something sitting for 16 hours a day is really not good if you want to do this for a long time if you want to still be making games in your 70s then definitely take care of your health and fitness find out what works for you what you like maybe you don't like running maybe biking maybe dancing maybe bodybuilding maybe power lifting maybe football whatever it is find something Fitness related you like and do it take some breaks go out on walks and drink plenty of water also speaking of goals related to my fitness journey here's a funny story I know exactly when I started taking Fitness seriously I know that because it was exactly when I said a clear goal and I know exactly what caused me to have that click in my brain it was a video on featuring physics Channel he was embarking on his oneyear journey of competing in a bodybu only show and he clearly outlined the plan to achieve his goal What specifically got me was when he talked about the clear plan with regards to macros how many grams of protein how many carbs and fats how many calories total and how the plan would change over time when I saw that white board that's when something clicked in my head after that I finally developed a clear plan until then I was learning about Fitness but I wasn't really following a clear plan I wasn't really paying attention to calories or macros or training splits but at that point I wrote down and defined the clear steps to achieve my goals for the next six months I tracked every food that I consumed and every workout doing that really helped me reach my fitness goals it was all because of that one video and that link in my brain so hopefully this video of mine will trigger that click in at least some of you which will hopefully mean that perhaps years from now you can look back on this video and remember that it was this video that made you set your goals and finally achieve them lastly on the topic of goals let me point out one very important thing setting goals is excellent just by clearly defining some goals you're already doing great and setting ambitious goals that are just slightly Out Of Reach is also excellent however when you eventually don't achieve one goal it is also extremely important not to be too harsh on yourself setting a goal is meant to be a positive thing something that will help you achieve whatever it is you want but if you then punish yourself because it didn't personally achieved it well then at that point it's a case of going one step forward and two steps back for example my own goal of launching third one Liberation by Q3 of this year I believe I can achieve that goal but also know it won't be challenging so there's a chance that I will quote unquote fail that goal and I might have to delay the game possibly to only launch it in January or February of 24 if that happens that will definitely suck but hopefully I won't be strong enough to not be too hard on myself because that would just not help at all if that does happen I hope I can take a deep breath and just keep working the plan so remember even if you quote unquote fail to achieve your goal you're still probably going to be better off than if you'd never Define the goal at all there's that quote shoot for the moon and even if you miss you will still land Among the Stars now go ahead write down a clear plan and make this year you finally achieve your goal with making and Publishing your game I wish you the absolute best of luck in your game Dev Journey
