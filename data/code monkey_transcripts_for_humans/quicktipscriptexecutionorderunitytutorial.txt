00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - change the order in which scripts are
00:06 - run this is very important when you have
00:08 - one script that needs to execute before
00:10 - another one so let's see a simple
00:12 - scenario where this is needed so in here
00:14 - I have two scripts with mono behaviors
00:16 - the game hammer and Emani display the
00:19 - game hammer is just on an empty game
00:21 - object and the money display is on this
00:23 - UI window which contains a text to
00:25 - display the current money so here in the
00:28 - code on the game handler on awake we
00:31 - initialize a string variable and then we
00:33 - tell the money display to update its
00:35 - text here on the money display we have a
00:39 - static function which is what we're
00:40 - using from the game Handler and it
00:42 - simply sets the money text text to be
00:45 - our new string so this is very simple we
00:47 - only have the game hammer calling this
00:49 - function which is obtaining the text
00:51 - with a new string so let's run the code
00:53 - and see what happens and upon reading
00:55 - the code we have an error right here a
00:57 - no reference exception which if we can
00:59 - we can see that the no reference is on
01:01 - our instance this is giving us a null
01:03 - reference exception because the instance
01:05 - is currently not and the instance is now
01:07 - because we are calling this function
01:09 - before this script has had a chance to
01:11 - execute its awake so the fix for that is
01:14 - very simple we go into edit onto our
01:16 - project settings and then our script
01:18 - execution order and in here we can set
01:20 - the order in which the scripts are run
01:22 - so I can go in here and I want the money
01:25 - this point to run before the game Hamel
01:27 - so I can simply drag the script and put
01:29 - it above the default time the scripts
01:32 - run from top to bottom so that means the
01:33 - money display will run before the
01:35 - default time for all the other scripts
01:37 - if you don't set anything specific then
01:39 - unity won't decide for itself which may
01:42 - cause an error like we saw since we need
01:44 - money display to execute before game
01:46 - Handler and if we don't drag it then
01:48 - unity won't decide for itself what
01:49 - happens during default time so by doing
01:51 - this we are making sure the money
01:53 - display executes before the game
01:54 - happened so now let's run the code and
01:57 - if there is it correctly updated to save
01:59 - money a hundred so we now have first the
02:01 - money display being run which executes
02:03 - sits awake
02:04 - set the instance and then the game
02:05 - hemler executes sits awake which tells
02:08 - the money display to execute which now
02:10 - it already has an instance and that's it
02:12 - hope you found this tip useful alright
02:15 - see you next time
