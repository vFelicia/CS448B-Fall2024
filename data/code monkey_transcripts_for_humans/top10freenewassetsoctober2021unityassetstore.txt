00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset source full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some of the
00:09 - highlights it will release in september
00:11 - 2021
00:12 - in this first video i will be covering a
00:14 - list of free assets and in the next ones
00:16 - i will be covering paid assets and tools
00:18 - check out the phone playlist to see all
00:20 - of the highlights every month you might
00:22 - find something that would be perfect for
00:23 - whatever project you're currently
00:24 - working on by the way there's a mega
00:27 - bundle happening right now on the unity
00:29 - store as usual it's a super deep
00:30 - discount up to 95 off it contains lots
00:33 - of interesting tools so there's one to
00:35 - help you manage an inventory database
00:38 - another one for placing some decals and
00:40 - the terrain system there's a digging
00:42 - system you can slice meshes volumetric
00:44 - vfx and tons more as usual with such a
00:46 - deep discount it's worth it if just one
00:48 - of these assets looks interesting check
00:50 - it out with the link in the description
00:52 - alright so starting off with an official
00:54 - asset made by unity cardskins
00:57 - this is an official add-on to the
00:58 - karting micro game so it's made
01:00 - primarily for that but really these are
01:02 - just car meshes so if you have a carton
01:05 - game of any kind then this can be quite
01:07 - useful the cars themselves look great
01:09 - very nice as eyes and pre-varied in
01:11 - total you've got 12 unique vehicles for
01:13 - you to play with then if instead you
01:15 - need some 2d particle effects here's
01:17 - three great ones
01:19 - these are impact effects so great for
01:21 - damaging things one of them looks like
01:23 - some electric damage the other one more
01:26 - fire and smoke and the last one putting
01:27 - them both together
01:29 - they are simple and they all look great
01:31 - for some textures here's a nice pack
01:33 - they're in a hand painted sound so
01:35 - slightly cartoony you've got some grass
01:38 - ground and ground with rocks of them
01:40 - with multiple variations and in pretty
01:42 - high resolution the variations also have
01:45 - different light baked into them so it
01:47 - allows you to fake light in your
01:49 - terrains without actually using lights
01:51 - for some props and assets here is an
01:53 - office scene
01:54 - i really like this style pretty cute the
01:56 - screenshots look excellent i really like
01:58 - the black outline it's a pretty big pack
02:01 - for something that's free you've got a
02:03 - bunch of building parts and quite a nice
02:05 - amount of props next up for an
02:07 - interesting tool here is collider x
02:10 - this is a tool to help you make your
02:11 - scene much more performant it goes
02:13 - through all the objects in your scene
02:15 - and then based on your settings it
02:17 - either has a mesh collider which is
02:19 - pretty expensive or it simplifies the
02:21 - object and adds a simple unboxing
02:23 - leather so this can be useful for very
02:25 - quickly improving performance in your
02:27 - scenes when you have tons of colliders
02:29 - if you need some great looking weapons
02:31 - check out this pack features quite a lot
02:33 - of them for a free pack you've got a
02:35 - bunch of axes some shields bows dagger
02:38 - swords and a couple of stops all of them
02:40 - with multiple visuals for quite a bit of
02:42 - customization so if you're working on
02:44 - the phone melee game then this one is
02:46 - great up next you can add some life to
02:48 - your sapphire levels with these decals
02:51 - make your scene look much more realistic
02:53 - by adding a bunch of stickers everywhere
02:55 - in total over 30 stickers with a bunch
02:57 - of warnings caution instructions and so
03:00 - on pretty interesting
03:01 - then here's a pretty unique one called
03:03 - simplenet
03:05 - based on description this is a super
03:06 - simple bare bones networking library it
03:09 - doesn't say how it works but i would
03:10 - assume that it's based on simple c-sharp
03:12 - sockets
03:13 - so this one could be a great asset for
03:15 - you to download and inspect the code if
03:17 - you want to learn the basics of
03:18 - networking connections in c sharp
03:21 - if you're working on a pixel art sci-fi
03:23 - game then check out this pack
03:25 - features one character and two enemies
03:27 - it's got quite a bit of animations for
03:29 - the main character and a bunch of
03:31 - background items so this one is great if
03:33 - you want to just quickly add a visual to
03:35 - your platformer or if you want to play
03:37 - around with some spreadsheet animation
03:39 - and finally here's another one also
03:41 - officially made by unity this one is
03:43 - probably not of much interest to game
03:45 - developers but it's pretty interesting
03:47 - as you might know unity is expanding
03:48 - more and more into different areas and
03:50 - one of those is automotive so this one
03:53 - seems like it's a template for creating
03:55 - some sort of car dashboard if you're
03:57 - working on a realistic racing game then
03:59 - maybe you can take some parts from this
04:01 - some of the gauges look really nice
04:03 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
04:05 - assets on the unity assessor for
04:07 - september 2021 there's links to all in
04:09 - the description stay tuned for the next
04:11 - video covering paid assets and tools
04:13 - there's lots of awesome stuff there
04:15 - check out the phone playlist to see some
04:16 - more lists with free unpaid assets and
04:18 - let me know if you pick up any of these
04:19 - and what you intend to do with them also
04:21 - check out my own free and paid assets on
04:23 - the store alright hope that's useful
04:25 - check out these videos to learn some
04:26 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
04:29 - supporters from
