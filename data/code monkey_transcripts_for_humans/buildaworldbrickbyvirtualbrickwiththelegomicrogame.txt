00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - newly released lego micro game
00:03 - this is now the fourth micro game that
00:05 - unity has made and this one as the name
00:07 - implies it's all in partnership with
00:09 - lego
00:09 - it's a 3d third person platformer with
00:12 - some really interesting behavior breaks
00:13 - and brick building system
00:15 - let's begin
00:18 - [Music]
00:23 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:25 - and this channel is all about helping
00:26 - you learn how to make your own games
00:28 - with
00:28 - in-depth tutorials made by a
00:30 - professional indie game developer so if
00:31 - you find the video helpful consider
00:33 - subscribing
00:34 - alright so let's check out the lego
00:36 - micro game like i said including this
00:37 - one there's already 4 micro games
00:39 - available
00:40 - the micro games are great starting
00:41 - points especially for beginners or
00:43 - anyone who wants to quickly prototype
00:45 - something
00:46 - first was the 2d platformer then the
00:48 - cart micro game and then the fps
00:50 - microgame
00:51 - i covered the fps microgame and even
00:53 - made an awesome game using it as a base
00:55 - so go check it out to see what you can
00:56 - easily build when you take the micro
00:58 - game as a base
00:59 - this video is made possible thanks to
01:01 - these awesome supporters
01:02 - go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get
01:05 - some perks and help keep the videos free
01:07 - for everyone
01:08 - now here let's check out the latest one
01:10 - which is in lego microgreen
01:12 - now first up we need to install it in
01:14 - order to do that you need to be using
01:15 - unity hub 2.4
01:17 - so if you're on an older version make
01:19 - sure you update it
01:20 - then on the installs make sure you have
01:23 - a unity 2019.4 version and so on
01:26 - so this is the lts version in my case i
01:28 - have it installed already
01:30 - and then this version of the unity hub
01:32 - comes with an update to the new project
01:33 - window
01:34 - so go into the projects tab and here
01:37 - click on new
01:38 - now here make sure that it's showing the
01:40 - lts version so 2019.4
01:42 - and now the updated part is over here
01:44 - the templates section
01:46 - so you've got the default ones and then
01:48 - downloads and update on the list
01:49 - and when it's done you can scroll down
01:51 - to see all the various templates
01:53 - so down here one of the ones that you
01:54 - see is indeed the lego microgrid
01:56 - so when you see it just click on the
01:58 - download button and when that's done
02:00 - just select it
02:01 - alright so then here give it a name
02:02 - let's make it the lego micro game
02:05 - and just hit on create
02:14 - all right so here we are right away
02:16 - inside the micro game
02:18 - now here we see two options for getting
02:20 - started
02:21 - you can go ahead and explore on your own
02:23 - or you can start with the guided
02:25 - tutorials which is kind of the main
02:26 - point of the micro games they provide
02:28 - you with a guided path to learn and
02:29 - modify
02:30 - it teaches you about the various windows
02:32 - like the hierarchy inspector scene view
02:33 - and so on
02:34 - and also guides you to make some changes
02:36 - in the game and play them
02:37 - so you should definitely go through the
02:38 - tutorials especially if you are a
02:40 - beginner
02:40 - now in my case i won't go to explore
02:42 - since i've already done the tutorials
02:44 - and i want to showcase the game in
02:45 - action
02:46 - alright so we have the game let's hit
02:48 - play and try it out
02:49 - so here it is it's a third person action
02:51 - platformer
02:52 - so you've got basic movement along with
02:54 - jumping as well as a double jump
02:57 - and the whole world as you can see is
02:59 - made up of lego bricks over here we've
03:00 - got a platform
03:01 - made up of lego some pickups made of
03:03 - lego then over there we have a random
03:05 - creature
03:07 - and the world is all made up using lego
03:10 - so
03:11 - we've got a whole bunch of pickups we've
03:12 - got our double jump
03:24 - [Music]
03:25 - and then we even have a win condition so
03:27 - we touch this
03:28 - and there you go we won our nice micro
03:30 - game
03:33 - all right so that's the basics of the
03:34 - micro game now this particular micro
03:36 - game has some really interesting systems
03:38 - with behavior breaks and the brake
03:40 - building system
03:41 - essentially you can select tons of basic
03:43 - bricks just like real life lego and snap
03:45 - them into position
03:46 - again just like real life lego and then
03:48 - some breaks have some custom behavior
03:50 - that you can mix and match to make some
03:52 - really interesting complex behaviors
03:53 - so let's look at both of those systems
03:55 - first up over here on the scene view
03:58 - on the top left corner you can see these
04:00 - two buttons so the left one
04:02 - enables the brick building connections
04:04 - and the right one defines the brick
04:05 - selection
04:06 - so these two make up the brick building
04:08 - system so let's see what this does
04:10 - now in the project files you have tons
04:11 - of stuff to make pretty much anything
04:13 - you can think of
04:14 - and since it's lego everything is built
04:16 - up from a handful of basic bricks
04:18 - now over here on the island if you go
04:19 - into this right one you can see down
04:21 - here we have some basic bricks already
04:23 - placed
04:24 - so you can see we have a normal 2x4
04:26 - brick then we also have some
04:28 - ram brakes some plants and this one with
04:31 - the different connector
04:32 - so you have these but you also have more
04:34 - basic brick types
04:35 - if you click on this and you'll look in
04:37 - the inspector over here you can see
04:38 - they're all inside a game object named
04:40 - star bricks so this one was originally
04:43 - prefab so you can go over here into the
04:45 - prefabs folder
04:46 - go under lego models and in here you
04:48 - have the brick collections so you've got
04:50 - the starter brick which is all these
04:52 - then you also have another one named
04:53 - cool bricks so let's go up here to a
04:56 - different island let's go into this one
04:58 - and just drag the coil breaks on there
05:00 - just like that
05:01 - so here you can see we have a ton more
05:03 - of brick types so you've got some random
05:05 - circles you've got some extenders
05:07 - you've got different shapes of basic
05:09 - bricks so you've got pretty much
05:10 - anything that you can use to build just
05:12 - about anything so if you're familiar
05:14 - with lego in real life this should all
05:15 - be quite familiar
05:16 - now if you select a single brick like
05:18 - let's say this 2x4 one
05:20 - over here in the inspector you can see
05:22 - the attached components so you have
05:24 - a brick script and a lego acid script
05:26 - now in working with this micro game you
05:28 - really don't need to touch the scripts
05:29 - at all
05:30 - everything works simply with drag and
05:31 - drop now we do see a warning here
05:34 - it's saying we cannot recolor the brick
05:35 - because it is inside a prefab instance
05:38 - and that's because we are editing the
05:39 - bricks over here inside our actual cool
05:41 - bricks prefab
05:42 - so we don't want to directly modify
05:44 - these ones so we want to use these as a
05:46 - base and copy them and use them
05:47 - elsewhere
05:48 - so we want to duplicate it but before we
05:50 - do that let's go up here and make sure
05:52 - we have the brick building disabled
05:54 - okay so the connection is not enabled
05:56 - now over here click ctrl d
05:58 - so this duplicates our object so there
06:00 - you go we have our copy right here
06:02 - and now we can move it let's say move it
06:04 - just in there and in the hierarchy just
06:06 - drag the object outside of the prefab
06:09 - so just drag it up here yep it's no
06:10 - longer part of the prefab
06:12 - alright so here we have our normal brick
06:14 - and over here we can now see and we can
06:15 - access the tilting cone
06:17 - so for example let's go with different
06:19 - one so over here you can pick a yellow
06:22 - you can pick pink blue green and so on
06:25 - you even have
06:26 - slightly transparent so yup just like
06:28 - that looks really interesting looks
06:29 - exactly just like lego
06:31 - alright we have our brick now let's do
06:32 - the same thing to copy a standard 2x2
06:35 - brick so there's this one right here
06:37 - now again be careful that you see these
06:39 - other ones but these are behavior bricks
06:41 - so as you can see they have a bunch more
06:43 - scripts attached to them we're going to
06:45 - look at those in a bit
06:46 - but for now we want the basic brick
06:47 - shape so it's this one right here that
06:49 - doesn't have any more scripts
06:50 - so again let's just duplicate it drag it
06:52 - outside of the hierarchy
06:54 - and just move it near that one okay so
06:57 - we have our two nice bricks
06:58 - and now that we have these two let's use
07:00 - the brick building system
07:01 - so for that let's click on this button
07:03 - in order to enable the connections
07:04 - and now we click and drag on this brick
07:07 - and as soon as we start dragging it
07:08 - starts following the mouse so now we can
07:10 - let go of the mouse
07:11 - and now the brick is still following the
07:12 - mouse and the way it works is it
07:14 - automatically attaches to whatever is
07:16 - under the mouse
07:17 - so as i place the mouse over this yep
07:18 - there you go you can see that it snaps
07:20 - into the various valid positions
07:22 - so i can put it in there put it in there
07:23 - and so on so this will automatically
07:25 - snap into valid positions so you can
07:27 - connect these two breaks very simply
07:29 - so just click and if there you go it
07:31 - gets placed exactly on top on the
07:32 - perfect position
07:33 - now if i want i can leave the brick
07:35 - building system enabled and just hit
07:36 - ctrl d
07:37 - and now i'm holding another one of the
07:39 - example the same type and let's put it
07:40 - on this corner
07:41 - alright so there it is we have a basic
07:43 - brick shape so this is the brick
07:45 - building system
07:46 - it automatically snaps into the perfect
07:48 - positions now by the way before we go
07:50 - further let's just make one quick note
07:52 - here
07:52 - which is we drag the cool bricks prefab
07:55 - so here it is we have this one
07:57 - and as we saw in order to play around we
07:58 - should really take them away from the
08:00 - prefabs first
08:01 - so we can do the way that we did or
08:03 - another approach is over here right
08:04 - click on this one
08:06 - and then select unpack prefab completely
08:09 - so if you click on it and yep there you
08:10 - go now we have normal separate objects
08:12 - inside of a home prefab
08:14 - so that's just a quick tip for unpacking
08:16 - prefabs alright so we use the brake
08:18 - building system to make our very basic
08:20 - brick shape
08:21 - and now the other button next to it is
08:22 - for selecting a single brick
08:24 - or all of the connected bricks so in
08:26 - this case with this mode i can click and
08:28 - select just that one just down or just
08:29 - that one
08:30 - and if i click to select the other mode
08:32 - and i click it selects all three of them
08:34 - so it selects all the connected bricks
08:36 - now the other awesome system are the
08:37 - behavior bricks you can find them down
08:40 - here on the project files all inside
08:41 - this folder
08:42 - lego behavior bricks so this is a really
08:44 - awesome system
08:45 - essentially each one of these bricks has
08:47 - a specific behavior
08:49 - and then you can combine them and place
08:50 - them on top of objects to really define
08:52 - some complex behavior
08:53 - so it's sort of like visual scripting
08:55 - except instead of connecting dots in a
08:57 - virtual graph you place behavior objects
08:59 - physically in the world
09:00 - right now to play around with it let's
09:01 - use our nice shape so
09:03 - selecting the whole object and with the
09:05 - connection system enabled let's click
09:06 - and drag all right
09:07 - now let's go to where the player spawns
09:09 - so right here and let's drop it right in
09:11 - there
09:12 - all right so here it is our nice shape
09:14 - and by the way another thing
09:15 - you can rotate without these so just
09:17 - click and hold this and press alt d and
09:19 - there you go it rotates on the various
09:21 - directions all right so we have our nice
09:23 - basic shape
09:24 - and then down here we have our behavior
09:26 - bricks now let's try out the hover
09:29 - behavior
09:29 - so it's right here we have the hover
09:31 - behavior brick so make sure that brick
09:33 - building is enabled
09:35 - and now let's click and drag this
09:36 - anywhere on the scene and there you go
09:38 - now it's following the mouse
09:39 - and i would just go here and click to
09:40 - place it exactly on top of our object
09:43 - and if there we go that's it we've now
09:44 - added a nice hover behavior onto our
09:46 - shape
09:47 - so let's try hitting play and if right
09:49 - away we see our object and it is indeed
09:51 - hovering up and down
09:52 - so that's how the system works it's
09:54 - really simple you just place down
09:55 - behavior bricks and they do a certain
09:57 - action
09:58 - now like i said they can be combined in
10:00 - order to make some really awesome
10:01 - behaviors
10:01 - so our object has a hover behavior brick
10:04 - now let's also go here in order to add
10:06 - the rotate so again just drag it in
10:08 - there
10:08 - now it's following the mouse now i click
10:10 - and i place it right in there
10:11 - and now if we hit play and yep there you
10:14 - go now it's hovering and rotating so as
10:16 - you can see it's a really intuitive
10:17 - system
10:18 - you just connect the bricks and
10:19 - everything works and even though it is
10:21 - very simple to use it's also very
10:22 - powerful
10:23 - so for example let's go here on this
10:25 - area
10:26 - and let's look into our lego models
10:29 - let's go down here into environment
10:31 - and we have a nice mountain so just
10:33 - click and drag and place it right in
10:34 - there
10:35 - and now for example let's go into the
10:36 - behavior bricks and over here we have
10:38 - the explode brick so just click and drag
10:40 - and let's place it right on top of our
10:41 - mountain
10:42 - and then here on the script for the
10:44 - behavior breaks you can also play around
10:45 - the parameters
10:46 - so for example over here we have the
10:48 - power so we've got a power of 10
10:50 - let's make it quite a bit more intense
10:51 - let's put it something like 30. all
10:53 - right so
10:54 - this brick will explode and destroy the
10:55 - mountain and now like i said you can
10:57 - combine multiple things so over here on
10:59 - our special object let's add a nice
11:01 - touch
11:01 - trigger so down here we have a touch
11:03 - trigger which like
11:04 - name implies it won't trigger an action
11:06 - when the player touches it
11:07 - so just click and drag it onto the scene
11:09 - let's connect onto our object
11:11 - now over here you see the touch trigger
11:12 - script and here for the things you see
11:14 - the scope
11:15 - where you can select to affect all the
11:17 - connected bricks or just this brick
11:20 - and then you see the target which can be
11:22 - the connected actions
11:23 - or can be specific actions so connected
11:26 - will essentially activate all of these
11:28 - and specific actions you can then give
11:30 - it a specific action
11:31 - so in this case we want to touch this
11:33 - and explore the mountain
11:34 - all right so here let's put it with a
11:36 - size of one and now we need to assign
11:37 - the section so over here we have our
11:39 - exfoliate object so just click and drag
11:41 - and drop it right in there
11:42 - and down here on the sense this is what
11:44 - is going to sense war so you can be the
11:46 - player for all breaks or any specific
11:48 - bricks in our case we want it to be the
11:49 - player so when the player touches this
11:51 - it's going to explode the mountain and
11:53 - do a really nice explosion
11:55 - alright let's test alright so here we
11:57 - are we have our nice rotating object and
12:00 - over there we have the mountain with the
12:01 - explosion
12:02 - and now as i approach and as i touch
12:04 - this object
12:05 - boom yeah there you go the mountain
12:07 - explodes and everything goes out flying
12:09 - alright so you can see the complex
12:10 - behavior you can make by combining
12:12 - simple actions
12:13 - so we added a touch node then we
12:15 - connected to an explosion as soon as we
12:16 - touched it exploded
12:18 - now like you see this one takes actions
12:20 - so for example you could connect this to
12:22 - the rotate
12:23 - and for example rotate the door only
12:24 - when you touch a button
12:26 - you could make it touch to enable an
12:28 - elevator or so on so down here you can
12:30 - see all the various behavior bricks
12:31 - available
12:32 - so you've got the alive which makes
12:34 - something seem like it's alive so it
12:36 - jumps up and down
12:37 - then you can play some audio you can
12:39 - have an elevator moving a platform up
12:41 - and down
12:42 - you can have the explode you can have
12:44 - the hazard which does damage to the
12:46 - player
12:46 - you can have the hover which moves up
12:48 - and down you can have them look at which
12:50 - won't look at a specific point like for
12:51 - example
12:52 - the player then you have to lose which
12:54 - won't cause the player to lose the game
12:56 - you have the move moving in a certain
12:58 - direction you have nearby trigger which
13:00 - triggers when the player or anything
13:01 - that it's sensing is within a certain
13:03 - distance
13:04 - then the pickup trigger which gets
13:05 - triggered whenever you touch a pickup
13:08 - then the pickup which is like this one
13:09 - you can pick it up then the platform
13:11 - which is the same as the elevator but
13:12 - goes horizontally inside of vertically
13:14 - then a random trigger which triggers a
13:16 - random action at some point between
13:18 - these two values
13:19 - then the rotate which rotates an object
13:21 - the shoot which fires projectiles
13:24 - then the timer trigger which triggers an
13:26 - action after a certain amount of time
13:27 - the touch trigger which as we saw
13:29 - happens when something touches the
13:30 - object
13:31 - and the wind which makes you win the
13:33 - level so you see how you have some
13:35 - basic simple actions that you can then
13:36 - combine them into really interesting
13:38 - ways
13:38 - so for example you could make an enemy
13:40 - so over here let's go into characters
13:43 - and let's drag let's say this part right
13:46 - here
13:47 - then let's go into the behavior bricks
13:49 - and let's drag the lookout
13:50 - brick so this will make sure that the
13:53 - burden looks at the player
13:54 - and again here make sure that this
13:56 - object is rotated correctly so this one
13:58 - we want it to face forward
13:59 - so let's pick it up but to do that let's
14:01 - select just one to just pick up just the
14:03 - object
14:04 - so pick it up now press alt d to rotate
14:07 - and okay now the eye is facing forward
14:08 - so policing like that okay
14:10 - then let's also add a shooting brick
14:12 - again make sure that it's facing forward
14:14 - and selecting look at and down here
14:16 - let's make a pause of zero so it always
14:18 - looks at the player
14:19 - let's test and yep there we have a bird
14:22 - and wherever i go it's looking at the
14:23 - player
14:24 - and it's constantly firing projectiles
14:27 - and if it hits me
14:29 - yep there you go i'm dead alright so you
14:30 - can see how this system is so powerful
14:33 - you can combine all these behaviors in
14:34 - order to make some really interesting
14:36 - scenarios
14:37 - and then just like all of the other
14:38 - micro games you have a bunch of mods on
14:40 - the official unity learn website
14:42 - so these are all guided step-by-step
14:44 - tutorials to modify the micro game even
14:46 - further

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to look at the newly released lego micro game this is now the fourth micro game that unity has made and this one as the name implies it's all in partnership with lego it's a 3d third person platformer with some really interesting behavior breaks and brick building system let's begin hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing alright so let's check out the lego micro game like i said including this one there's already 4 micro games available the micro games are great starting points especially for beginners or anyone who wants to quickly prototype something first was the 2d platformer then the cart micro game and then the fps microgame i covered the fps microgame and even made an awesome game using it as a base so go check it out to see what you can easily build when you take the micro game as a base this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone now here let's check out the latest one which is in lego microgreen now first up we need to install it in order to do that you need to be using unity hub 2.4 so if you're on an older version make sure you update it then on the installs make sure you have a unity 2019.4 version and so on so this is the lts version in my case i have it installed already and then this version of the unity hub comes with an update to the new project window so go into the projects tab and here click on new now here make sure that it's showing the lts version so 2019.4 and now the updated part is over here the templates section so you've got the default ones and then downloads and update on the list and when it's done you can scroll down to see all the various templates so down here one of the ones that you see is indeed the lego microgrid so when you see it just click on the download button and when that's done just select it alright so then here give it a name let's make it the lego micro game and just hit on create all right so here we are right away inside the micro game now here we see two options for getting started you can go ahead and explore on your own or you can start with the guided tutorials which is kind of the main point of the micro games they provide you with a guided path to learn and modify it teaches you about the various windows like the hierarchy inspector scene view and so on and also guides you to make some changes in the game and play them so you should definitely go through the tutorials especially if you are a beginner now in my case i won't go to explore since i've already done the tutorials and i want to showcase the game in action alright so we have the game let's hit play and try it out so here it is it's a third person action platformer so you've got basic movement along with jumping as well as a double jump and the whole world as you can see is made up of lego bricks over here we've got a platform made up of lego some pickups made of lego then over there we have a random creature and the world is all made up using lego so we've got a whole bunch of pickups we've got our double jump and then we even have a win condition so we touch this and there you go we won our nice micro game all right so that's the basics of the micro game now this particular micro game has some really interesting systems with behavior breaks and the brake building system essentially you can select tons of basic bricks just like real life lego and snap them into position again just like real life lego and then some breaks have some custom behavior that you can mix and match to make some really interesting complex behaviors so let's look at both of those systems first up over here on the scene view on the top left corner you can see these two buttons so the left one enables the brick building connections and the right one defines the brick selection so these two make up the brick building system so let's see what this does now in the project files you have tons of stuff to make pretty much anything you can think of and since it's lego everything is built up from a handful of basic bricks now over here on the island if you go into this right one you can see down here we have some basic bricks already placed so you can see we have a normal 2x4 brick then we also have some ram brakes some plants and this one with the different connector so you have these but you also have more basic brick types if you click on this and you'll look in the inspector over here you can see they're all inside a game object named star bricks so this one was originally prefab so you can go over here into the prefabs folder go under lego models and in here you have the brick collections so you've got the starter brick which is all these then you also have another one named cool bricks so let's go up here to a different island let's go into this one and just drag the coil breaks on there just like that so here you can see we have a ton more of brick types so you've got some random circles you've got some extenders you've got different shapes of basic bricks so you've got pretty much anything that you can use to build just about anything so if you're familiar with lego in real life this should all be quite familiar now if you select a single brick like let's say this 2x4 one over here in the inspector you can see the attached components so you have a brick script and a lego acid script now in working with this micro game you really don't need to touch the scripts at all everything works simply with drag and drop now we do see a warning here it's saying we cannot recolor the brick because it is inside a prefab instance and that's because we are editing the bricks over here inside our actual cool bricks prefab so we don't want to directly modify these ones so we want to use these as a base and copy them and use them elsewhere so we want to duplicate it but before we do that let's go up here and make sure we have the brick building disabled okay so the connection is not enabled now over here click ctrl d so this duplicates our object so there you go we have our copy right here and now we can move it let's say move it just in there and in the hierarchy just drag the object outside of the prefab so just drag it up here yep it's no longer part of the prefab alright so here we have our normal brick and over here we can now see and we can access the tilting cone so for example let's go with different one so over here you can pick a yellow you can pick pink blue green and so on you even have slightly transparent so yup just like that looks really interesting looks exactly just like lego alright we have our brick now let's do the same thing to copy a standard 2x2 brick so there's this one right here now again be careful that you see these other ones but these are behavior bricks so as you can see they have a bunch more scripts attached to them we're going to look at those in a bit but for now we want the basic brick shape so it's this one right here that doesn't have any more scripts so again let's just duplicate it drag it outside of the hierarchy and just move it near that one okay so we have our two nice bricks and now that we have these two let's use the brick building system so for that let's click on this button in order to enable the connections and now we click and drag on this brick and as soon as we start dragging it starts following the mouse so now we can let go of the mouse and now the brick is still following the mouse and the way it works is it automatically attaches to whatever is under the mouse so as i place the mouse over this yep there you go you can see that it snaps into the various valid positions so i can put it in there put it in there and so on so this will automatically snap into valid positions so you can connect these two breaks very simply so just click and if there you go it gets placed exactly on top on the perfect position now if i want i can leave the brick building system enabled and just hit ctrl d and now i'm holding another one of the example the same type and let's put it on this corner alright so there it is we have a basic brick shape so this is the brick building system it automatically snaps into the perfect positions now by the way before we go further let's just make one quick note here which is we drag the cool bricks prefab so here it is we have this one and as we saw in order to play around we should really take them away from the prefabs first so we can do the way that we did or another approach is over here right click on this one and then select unpack prefab completely so if you click on it and yep there you go now we have normal separate objects inside of a home prefab so that's just a quick tip for unpacking prefabs alright so we use the brake building system to make our very basic brick shape and now the other button next to it is for selecting a single brick or all of the connected bricks so in this case with this mode i can click and select just that one just down or just that one and if i click to select the other mode and i click it selects all three of them so it selects all the connected bricks now the other awesome system are the behavior bricks you can find them down here on the project files all inside this folder lego behavior bricks so this is a really awesome system essentially each one of these bricks has a specific behavior and then you can combine them and place them on top of objects to really define some complex behavior so it's sort of like visual scripting except instead of connecting dots in a virtual graph you place behavior objects physically in the world right now to play around with it let's use our nice shape so selecting the whole object and with the connection system enabled let's click and drag all right now let's go to where the player spawns so right here and let's drop it right in there all right so here it is our nice shape and by the way another thing you can rotate without these so just click and hold this and press alt d and there you go it rotates on the various directions all right so we have our nice basic shape and then down here we have our behavior bricks now let's try out the hover behavior so it's right here we have the hover behavior brick so make sure that brick building is enabled and now let's click and drag this anywhere on the scene and there you go now it's following the mouse and i would just go here and click to place it exactly on top of our object and if there we go that's it we've now added a nice hover behavior onto our shape so let's try hitting play and if right away we see our object and it is indeed hovering up and down so that's how the system works it's really simple you just place down behavior bricks and they do a certain action now like i said they can be combined in order to make some really awesome behaviors so our object has a hover behavior brick now let's also go here in order to add the rotate so again just drag it in there now it's following the mouse now i click and i place it right in there and now if we hit play and yep there you go now it's hovering and rotating so as you can see it's a really intuitive system you just connect the bricks and everything works and even though it is very simple to use it's also very powerful so for example let's go here on this area and let's look into our lego models let's go down here into environment and we have a nice mountain so just click and drag and place it right in there and now for example let's go into the behavior bricks and over here we have the explode brick so just click and drag and let's place it right on top of our mountain and then here on the script for the behavior breaks you can also play around the parameters so for example over here we have the power so we've got a power of 10 let's make it quite a bit more intense let's put it something like 30. all right so this brick will explode and destroy the mountain and now like i said you can combine multiple things so over here on our special object let's add a nice touch trigger so down here we have a touch trigger which like name implies it won't trigger an action when the player touches it so just click and drag it onto the scene let's connect onto our object now over here you see the touch trigger script and here for the things you see the scope where you can select to affect all the connected bricks or just this brick and then you see the target which can be the connected actions or can be specific actions so connected will essentially activate all of these and specific actions you can then give it a specific action so in this case we want to touch this and explore the mountain all right so here let's put it with a size of one and now we need to assign the section so over here we have our exfoliate object so just click and drag and drop it right in there and down here on the sense this is what is going to sense war so you can be the player for all breaks or any specific bricks in our case we want it to be the player so when the player touches this it's going to explode the mountain and do a really nice explosion alright let's test alright so here we are we have our nice rotating object and over there we have the mountain with the explosion and now as i approach and as i touch this object boom yeah there you go the mountain explodes and everything goes out flying alright so you can see the complex behavior you can make by combining simple actions so we added a touch node then we connected to an explosion as soon as we touched it exploded now like you see this one takes actions so for example you could connect this to the rotate and for example rotate the door only when you touch a button you could make it touch to enable an elevator or so on so down here you can see all the various behavior bricks available so you've got the alive which makes something seem like it's alive so it jumps up and down then you can play some audio you can have an elevator moving a platform up and down you can have the explode you can have the hazard which does damage to the player you can have the hover which moves up and down you can have them look at which won't look at a specific point like for example the player then you have to lose which won't cause the player to lose the game you have the move moving in a certain direction you have nearby trigger which triggers when the player or anything that it's sensing is within a certain distance then the pickup trigger which gets triggered whenever you touch a pickup then the pickup which is like this one you can pick it up then the platform which is the same as the elevator but goes horizontally inside of vertically then a random trigger which triggers a random action at some point between these two values then the rotate which rotates an object the shoot which fires projectiles then the timer trigger which triggers an action after a certain amount of time the touch trigger which as we saw happens when something touches the object and the wind which makes you win the level so you see how you have some basic simple actions that you can then combine them into really interesting ways so for example you could make an enemy so over here let's go into characters and let's drag let's say this part right here then let's go into the behavior bricks and let's drag the lookout brick so this will make sure that the burden looks at the player and again here make sure that this object is rotated correctly so this one we want it to face forward so let's pick it up but to do that let's select just one to just pick up just the object so pick it up now press alt d to rotate and okay now the eye is facing forward so policing like that okay then let's also add a shooting brick again make sure that it's facing forward and selecting look at and down here let's make a pause of zero so it always looks at the player let's test and yep there we have a bird and wherever i go it's looking at the player and it's constantly firing projectiles and if it hits me yep there you go i'm dead alright so you can see how this system is so powerful you can combine all these behaviors in order to make some really interesting scenarios and then just like all of the other micro games you have a bunch of mods on the official unity learn website so these are all guided stepbystep tutorials to modify the micro game even further so at the time of this recording there are three mods available so one of them is on swapping the main camera with a different one included in the project another one is on including a locked area and last one is on building a custom enemy check them out on the official until earned website alright so that's the brand new lego micro game made by unity now these micro games are all really interesting and a great starting point for beginners to learn from if you haven't seen it yet then go watch the video on my awesome game based on the fps micro game it shows you what you can build by taking these micro games as base alright now go ahead open up unity and play with some legos this video is made possible thanks to these awesome
