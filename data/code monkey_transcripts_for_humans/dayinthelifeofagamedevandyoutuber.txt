00:03 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:05 - and this is my highly detailed Day in
00:08 - the Life video of a solo indie game
00:10 - developer and YouTuber
00:12 - my day starts off at 6am through various
00:14 - experiments I have found that my brain
00:16 - works so much better in the morning than
00:17 - night there's no noise or any
00:19 - instructions the whole world is really
00:20 - calm at this time which makes it super
00:22 - easy to stay focused being able to set
00:24 - your own hours to work when you're most
00:25 - effective is definitely one of the main
00:27 - benefits of being self-employed if you
00:29 - can I would definitely encourage you to
00:30 - experiment with different work schedules
00:31 - figure out what works best for you I get
00:34 - up I make a cup of coffee I sit down and
00:36 - the first thing I do is write my to-do
00:37 - list for a day I find it very important
00:39 - to work from a list so I've got to-do
00:41 - lists for all kinds of things everything
00:42 - from daily work tasks the only personal
00:44 - tasks things to do on my game videos to
00:46 - write record research and so on I write
00:49 - my main list and I pick up my laptop and
00:51 - I start working now one thing that I
00:52 - won't mention quite a lot in this video
00:54 - is how I like to change things
00:55 - constantly most of the day I tend to
00:57 - work on my desktop but when I wake up I
00:58 - like to work on my laptop just sitting
01:00 - on my couch for me keeping things
01:02 - different is crucial to be able to stay
01:04 - at maximum productivity throughout the
01:05 - day so I open up my laptop check my
01:07 - emails and check Twitter where I pretty
01:09 - much only follow unity and gamedaf
01:10 - people just see if anything happened or
01:12 - if there's any interesting posts then I
01:14 - answer all the questions on my courses
01:16 - and comments on YouTube this is
01:18 - something that I've done since the very
01:19 - beginning of this channel five years ago
01:21 - and I still keep doing it as Channel
01:22 - grows more and more this does become
01:24 - more and more time consuming but I still
01:26 - love it if it grows too much then one
01:28 - day at some point it will become
01:29 - impossible to answer everything but so
01:31 - far it's still manageable answering
01:33 - questions is a great way for me to get
01:34 - my brain certain sometimes there's some
01:36 - really interesting questions that really
01:38 - force me to think about some problem
01:39 - differently or learn something new it
01:41 - also forces me to put into words where I
01:43 - made some choices that I made so it's
01:44 - always great for both the person asking
01:46 - to get a very specific answer and also
01:48 - for me to get better at communicating
01:50 - why did something the way I did and what
01:52 - are the pros and cons then when I've
01:53 - answered all the questions if it's on
01:55 - before 7am I go research some topic or
01:57 - write some upcoming video I always have
01:59 - a near infinite amount of videos on my
02:00 - queue there's only so much stuff that
02:02 - I'd love to cover in research then at
02:04 - seven I take my first of many many
02:05 - breaks I take my dogs outside my dog
02:08 - Tico he's already a bit old and he has a
02:10 - small bladder so he really desperately
02:11 - needs to outside quickly we go out to
02:13 - order the tree and come back inside
02:16 - now I open up the desktop and like I
02:18 - said I like to work from a list
02:19 - personally I prefer to keep a physical
02:21 - to-do list so I really just write down
02:22 - by hand I like it physical so it's
02:24 - always right next to me instead of being
02:25 - on a desktop window as the work I'm
02:27 - currently working on my upcoming steam
02:29 - game thing Guardians it's a fun
02:30 - automation Colony building defense game
02:32 - it's coming out next week so go ahead
02:34 - edit your wishlist and stay tuned for
02:35 - the final release I really hope you'll
02:37 - enjoy the game now since at this time I
02:39 - don't have too long to do some work I
02:40 - make sure to pick some simple tasks
02:42 - while this day I worked on updating the
02:44 - theme store Page I rewrote the
02:45 - description and got some translators to
02:47 - unlocalize it in various languages then
02:49 - after two hours of nice focused work
02:51 - around 8 AM my brain is starting to
02:53 - become a bit too drained so it's time
02:54 - for a change and that's when I go to the
02:56 - gym this is another thing that is very
02:57 - crucial to me I generally believe that
03:00 - the main reason why I have never really
03:01 - suffered from serious burnout is simply
03:03 - because I never sacrificed my gym time
03:05 - or my sleep this is something where it's
03:07 - not just nice to have a break to do
03:09 - something different for me it's
03:10 - absolutely essential to keep functioning
03:12 - so I go there and lift some weights get
03:14 - a nice pump get my heart rate running
03:15 - and really just enjoy myself by doing
03:17 - something very different from just
03:18 - sitting in front of my computer I'm also
03:20 - currently training to run my first
03:22 - marathon so most days I also rent a gym
03:24 - and back it's been a nice challenge to
03:26 - combine both lifting and running I come
03:28 - back around 10 AM and as soon as I get
03:30 - home my dogs are always very excited so
03:31 - it's time to go for a walk I take my
03:33 - phone with me and this is a great time
03:35 - to catch up on some articles
03:36 - specifically the two game marketing
03:38 - newsletters that I've mentioned many
03:39 - times game discover KOA and Chris
03:41 - akowski going on a 20-minute dog walk is
03:43 - the perfect time to read a little bit
03:45 - and just enjoy nature or simply catch up
03:47 - on regular news for the game industry
03:49 - normally I check polygon for more gaming
03:51 - mainstream news and rock paper shotgun
03:53 - for more PC specific news as soon as I
03:56 - get back home it's time for my very
03:57 - first meal again find out what works
03:59 - best for you personally I really don't
04:01 - like working out with a heavy stomach so
04:03 - I normally work out fastened I only eat
04:05 - after I get back from gym I make my
04:07 - usual breakfast just yogurt with some
04:09 - protein and an apple it's about 350
04:11 - calories pretty nice with that ready
04:13 - it's usually around 10 20 so it's time
04:15 - to get back to work on my game again I
04:17 - go through my tutorial list and this
04:19 - time pick some more complex tasks this
04:21 - time I was working on finishing up the
04:23 - scripting Logic for the starting
04:24 - spaceship level this is pretty much
04:26 - where the game starts where something
04:27 - bad happens before of the mechanics
04:29 - actually unlock normally at this point
04:31 - this is where I get a nice chunk of
04:33 - undistracted work time which is usually
04:34 - very productive I normally keep my phone
04:36 - on silent and off to the side so there
04:38 - are really no distractions I like to put
04:40 - some music on the background lately I've
04:42 - been listening to either the chainsaw
04:43 - Man soundtrack or some 41 Greatest Hits
04:45 - then around 1pm once again my brain is
04:48 - starting to get tired so it's time for
04:49 - another break this time for lunch in
04:51 - reality I'm a pretty boring person when
04:53 - it comes to food I eat mostly the same
04:55 - thing almost every single day so my
04:57 - usual lunch is really just some nice
04:58 - round chicken with scrambled eggs very
05:00 - simple to cook very high in protein and
05:02 - taste great usually I eat at my PC and
05:04 - usually I eat while watching some
05:06 - YouTube videos either it's something
05:08 - random or I watch videos from other
05:09 - Unity video creators oh and by the way I
05:12 - also tend to watch videos on 2 or 3xpin
05:14 - this is something that I started doing a
05:16 - few years back and I slowly increase the
05:18 - speed nowadays for me watching a video
05:20 - at one time speed just normal speed that
05:22 - makes the person sound really drunk I
05:24 - use this plugin to set YouTube to any
05:26 - speed with this watching something at
05:28 - 2xp it means that a 10 minute video
05:29 - really only takes 5 minutes and since I
05:32 - slowly increase the speed over time I
05:33 - can still fully understand everything
05:35 - anyway so with my online Cheatin it's
05:37 - time to get back to work and at this
05:39 - time I normally work on something a bit
05:40 - different usually writing a video or
05:42 - doing some editing maybe recording or
05:44 - researching something again switching
05:46 - tasks is really one of the main things
05:47 - that allows me to stay productive the
05:49 - whole day it's honestly one of the big
05:51 - benefits of making both games and
05:52 - YouTube videos at the same time it can
05:54 - definitely be a ton of work doing two
05:56 - huge things but being able to jump
05:58 - between tasks is really nice so at this
06:00 - time I'm usually working on some videos
06:01 - but sometimes I'm simply doing just some
06:03 - admin work I am mostly just a one person
06:05 - team behind this channel my games my
06:07 - courses so if there's any bills that
06:09 - need paying or invoices to create it's
06:11 - up to me to do that I have to download
06:13 - the various receipts for my expenses and
06:15 - send them my accountant I need to check
06:17 - any taxes I need to pay and make sure
06:19 - that I pay them on time it's definitely
06:21 - annoying work but this is a proper
06:22 - business it's something that needs to be
06:24 - done so I can keep my job and keep doing
06:25 - everything legally around this time I
06:27 - also like to try reading a bit although
06:29 - honestly I don't do that as much as I
06:31 - would like I definitely need to schedule
06:32 - some time just for reading I'm pretty
06:34 - much constantly reading or rereading
06:36 - code complete too I highly highly
06:38 - recommend this book if you want to take
06:39 - your clean code skills to the next level
06:41 - and for fun earlier this year I picked
06:43 - up my very first manga I already love
06:45 - dragon ball so this was the perfect pick
06:47 - I've been really enjoying it although I
06:49 - haven't read much yet I'm only on the
06:50 - fourth chapter so on the awesome Goku
06:52 - Vegeta fight from the sansaga definitely
06:54 - want to keep reading it now it's time to
06:56 - take the dogs for another one this time
06:58 - might take a longer walk usually around
07:00 - 30 or 40 minutes and I usually take my
07:01 - earphones with me I download some
07:04 - podcasts or random videos onto my phone
07:05 - and go for a walk for gaming news I like
07:08 - to listen to the easy analyze podcast
07:09 - for General gaming videos I like to
07:11 - listen to game ranks for some industry
07:13 - insight and listen to the factor factor
07:15 - the and just for fun and listen to some
07:17 - Dragon Ball discussion videos or from
07:19 - learning more about YouTube and
07:20 - listening to Conan and Samir or creative
07:22 - support and every week I listen to the
07:24 - gamedev show so plenty of options to
07:25 - choose anything to enjoy on mile long
07:27 - however sometimes if I have some bug in
07:29 - my game that I just cannot solve or some
07:31 - random game design problem when that
07:33 - happens I don't take anything with me I
07:35 - find the time walking my dogs is
07:37 - absolutely excellent for General
07:38 - thinking and problem solving sometimes
07:40 - there's a problem that seems impossible
07:42 - to solve and suddenly after walking for
07:43 - a bit the solution becomes crystal clear
07:45 - as soon as I come back home it's back to
07:47 - work I might make some popcorn if I feel
07:50 - like a nice snack I eat lots of plain
07:52 - popcorn the whole day and also a bunch
07:53 - of this I don't know what is the exact
07:55 - name in English in Portuguese it's
07:57 - called Latina but in English I think
07:59 - gelatin is something completely
08:00 - different I think the correct word for
08:02 - this is jello anyways I'm definitely
08:04 - addicted to snacking I'm constantly
08:05 - eating so I try to eat low calorie foods
08:07 - come back to work this time it's pretty
08:09 - serious so I check out some nice complex
08:11 - sets on my game on this day I was
08:13 - working on the mechanics related to the
08:14 - operon system this is the world
08:16 - representation that is running while
08:18 - you're in a different world it's how the
08:20 - game keeps track of resources being
08:21 - generated in every world and transferred
08:23 - between them and when my brain starts to
08:25 - get foggy once again I change how I work
08:27 - usually in late afternoon I just grab my
08:29 - laptop and go somewhere else to work I
08:32 - go to a random coffee shop or the
08:33 - supermarket pretty much anywhere I can
08:35 - sit I use this time to either catch up
08:37 - and answer some more comments or
08:38 - research and write an upcoming video
08:40 - although once a week I don't actually
08:42 - work the whole afternoon something that
08:44 - I've been doing for over 10 years now is
08:45 - volunteering adding local dog shelter
08:47 - it's yet another thing that I do that
08:49 - does not involve sitting in front of the
08:51 - screen so it's yet another way that
08:52 - helps me avoid burnout I love dogs so
08:54 - it's really great to be able to go there
08:56 - help with the cleanup and feeding and of
08:58 - course play with them and here's a bonus
09:00 - fun fact the dogs that I have right now
09:01 - Tico and Teka they actually used to live
09:04 - in this shelter so I actually knew them
09:06 - for years before I ever adopted them I
09:08 - think they first went to shelter in
09:10 - about 2015 they are really great dogs
09:12 - but they are inseparable and there are
09:14 - not many people who want to adopt two
09:16 - ducks at once so they didn't live that
09:17 - the shelter pretty much their own lives
09:19 - and I saw them and played with them
09:20 - every time that I went there and then
09:22 - when my previous dog suddenly passed
09:24 - away in 2021 that's when I decided to
09:26 - adopt him so yeah doing this volunteer
09:28 - work at the shelter is really nice
09:30 - playing with dogs is yet another thing
09:32 - that doesn't inform screens at all and
09:33 - really helps me refresh so once again I
09:36 - really do believe this is yet another
09:37 - reason why I've never suffered from
09:38 - burnout then at the end of the afternoon
09:40 - at around 6 PM that is usually when my
09:42 - videos go live although this part is
09:44 - pretty automated I I watched a video and
09:46 - validate everything in the early
09:48 - afternoon then just set it to schedule
09:49 - to go live on both YouTube and my
09:51 - website the video emails on the website
09:53 - they're all sent automatically if you
09:55 - don't want to depend on the YouTube
09:56 - algorithm showing you videos you can set
09:58 - up your account on the website to
09:59 - receive emails at around 7 PM it's
10:01 - roughly dinner time although I don't
10:03 - actually normally eat a regular dinner
10:05 - like most people once again over time
10:07 - through experimentation I have learned
10:08 - what works for me and what doesn't
10:09 - growing up with my parents we always had
10:11 - a really heavy dinner around 9pm and I
10:14 - just found out that always made me
10:15 - really sluggish which then massively
10:17 - impacted my sleep so nowadays usually my
10:19 - dinner is really just some popcorn and
10:21 - some yogurt so something really light
10:22 - although keep in mind that definitely
10:24 - does not mean that I starve I simply eat
10:26 - a lot throughout the day in fact my big
10:28 - problem is always eating too much every
10:30 - day I normally eat around 3000 calories
10:32 - I then maybe do a little bit more work
10:34 - usually something wrong light perhaps
10:36 - just watching some videos for research
10:38 - or just entering some more comments and
10:40 - questions nothing too intense then at
10:42 - about a 30 I try to stop working
10:44 - although I still do some things somewhat
10:46 - related to work usually at this time
10:48 - it's when I like to watch videos from
10:49 - either a spider cat or wonderbots or
10:51 - orbital potato since I don't really have
10:54 - time to play games myself watching
10:56 - someone plays how I can keep up with all
10:57 - the awesome games that are coming out
10:59 - these three specific channels are really
11:01 - excellent if you're interested in the
11:03 - massive amount of indie games that come
11:04 - out each month again I watch them at
11:07 - about 2-3 X speed so a 40 minute video
11:09 - really just takes about 15 minutes I
11:11 - watch those as well as some random
11:13 - videos I like to watch a little bit of
11:14 - everything then around 9 9 30 then it's
11:17 - time for bed like I said I really don't
11:19 - sacrifice my sleep for anything so even
11:21 - though I do wake up pretty early I also
11:23 - go to bed very early I fall asleep and
11:25 - just get ready to do it all over again
11:27 - the next day
11:29 - all right so that's a day in my life I
11:31 - like making step-by-step tutorials so
11:33 - this is probably the most detailed in
11:34 - the life video that exists I hope you
11:36 - found it interesting to see how I
11:37 - managed my life hopefully some of this
11:39 - can be helpful to you although my main
11:41 - advice is really just experiment with
11:43 - yourself and figure out what works for
11:45 - you definitely do not just blindly copy
11:47 - my routine everyone is unique perhaps
11:49 - you work better at night perhaps it
11:51 - makes more sense for you to work out in
11:52 - the afternoon perhaps you prefer some
11:54 - like yoga overlifting or perhaps you
11:57 - prefer playing games instead of just
11:58 - watching them or perhaps you prefer
12:00 - solid and broken chunks of work instead
12:02 - of many breaks so really my best advice
12:04 - is really just do some experiments and
12:06 - figure out what works for you when you
12:07 - unload alright so now I gotta finish
12:09 - editing this video and get back to work
12:11 - I'm working really hard to make the best
12:13 - game that I can make the only state is
12:14 - just next week so stay tuned for that
12:16 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
12:18 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is my highly detailed Day in the Life video of a solo indie game developer and YouTuber my day starts off at 6am through various experiments I have found that my brain works so much better in the morning than night there's no noise or any instructions the whole world is really calm at this time which makes it super easy to stay focused being able to set your own hours to work when you're most effective is definitely one of the main benefits of being selfemployed if you can I would definitely encourage you to experiment with different work schedules figure out what works best for you I get up I make a cup of coffee I sit down and the first thing I do is write my todo list for a day I find it very important to work from a list so I've got todo lists for all kinds of things everything from daily work tasks the only personal tasks things to do on my game videos to write record research and so on I write my main list and I pick up my laptop and I start working now one thing that I won't mention quite a lot in this video is how I like to change things constantly most of the day I tend to work on my desktop but when I wake up I like to work on my laptop just sitting on my couch for me keeping things different is crucial to be able to stay at maximum productivity throughout the day so I open up my laptop check my emails and check Twitter where I pretty much only follow unity and gamedaf people just see if anything happened or if there's any interesting posts then I answer all the questions on my courses and comments on YouTube this is something that I've done since the very beginning of this channel five years ago and I still keep doing it as Channel grows more and more this does become more and more time consuming but I still love it if it grows too much then one day at some point it will become impossible to answer everything but so far it's still manageable answering questions is a great way for me to get my brain certain sometimes there's some really interesting questions that really force me to think about some problem differently or learn something new it also forces me to put into words where I made some choices that I made so it's always great for both the person asking to get a very specific answer and also for me to get better at communicating why did something the way I did and what are the pros and cons then when I've answered all the questions if it's on before 7am I go research some topic or write some upcoming video I always have a near infinite amount of videos on my queue there's only so much stuff that I'd love to cover in research then at seven I take my first of many many breaks I take my dogs outside my dog Tico he's already a bit old and he has a small bladder so he really desperately needs to outside quickly we go out to order the tree and come back inside now I open up the desktop and like I said I like to work from a list personally I prefer to keep a physical todo list so I really just write down by hand I like it physical so it's always right next to me instead of being on a desktop window as the work I'm currently working on my upcoming steam game thing Guardians it's a fun automation Colony building defense game it's coming out next week so go ahead edit your wishlist and stay tuned for the final release I really hope you'll enjoy the game now since at this time I don't have too long to do some work I make sure to pick some simple tasks while this day I worked on updating the theme store Page I rewrote the description and got some translators to unlocalize it in various languages then after two hours of nice focused work around 8 AM my brain is starting to become a bit too drained so it's time for a change and that's when I go to the gym this is another thing that is very crucial to me I generally believe that the main reason why I have never really suffered from serious burnout is simply because I never sacrificed my gym time or my sleep

it's usually around 10 20 so it's time to get back to work on my game again I go through my tutorial list and this time pick some more complex tasks this time I was working on finishing up the scripting Logic for the starting spaceship level this is pretty much where the game starts where something bad happens before of the mechanics actually unlock normally at this point this is where I get a nice chunk of undistracted work time which is usually very productive I normally keep my phone on silent and off to the side so there are really no distractions I like to put some music on the background lately I've been listening to either the chainsaw Man soundtrack or some 41 Greatest Hits then around 1pm once again my brain is starting to get tired so it's time for another break this time for lunch in reality I'm a pretty boring person when it comes to food I eat mostly the same thing almost every single day so my usual lunch is really just some nice round chicken with scrambled eggs very simple to cook very high in protein and taste great usually I eat at my PC and usually I eat while watching some YouTube videos either it's something random or I watch videos from other Unity video creators oh and by the way I also tend to watch videos on 2 or 3xpin this is something that I started doing a few years back and I slowly increase the speed nowadays for me watching a video at one time speed just normal speed that makes the person sound really drunk I use this plugin to set YouTube to any speed with this watching something at 2xp it means that a 10 minute video really only takes 5 minutes and since I slowly increase the speed over time I can still fully understand everything anyway so with my online Cheatin it's time to get back to work and at this time I normally work on something a bit different usually writing a video or doing some editing maybe recording or researching something again switching tasks is really one of the main things that allows me to stay productive the whole day it's honestly one of the big benefits of making both games and YouTube videos at the same time it can definitely be a ton of work doing two huge things but being able to jump between tasks is really nice so at this time I'm usually working on some videos but sometimes I'm simply doing just some admin work I am mostly just a one person team behind this channel my games my courses so if there's any bills that need paying or invoices to create it's up to me to do that I have to download the various receipts for my expenses and send them my accountant I need to check any taxes I need to pay and make sure that I pay them on time it's definitely annoying work but this is a proper business it's something that needs to be done so I can keep my job and keep doing everything legally around this time I also like to try reading a bit although honestly I don't do that as much as I would like I definitely need to schedule some time just for reading I'm pretty much constantly reading or rereading code complete too I highly highly recommend this book if you want to take your clean code skills to the next level and for fun earlier this year I picked up my very first manga I already love dragon ball so this was the perfect pick I've been really enjoying it although I haven't read much yet I'm only on the fourth chapter so on the awesome Goku Vegeta fight from the sansaga definitely want to keep reading it now it's time to take the dogs for another one this time might take a longer walk usually around 30 or 40 minutes and I usually take my earphones with me I download some podcasts or random videos onto my phone and go for a walk for gaming news I like to listen to the easy analyze podcast for General gaming videos I like to listen to game ranks for some industry insight and listen to the factor factor the and just for fun and listen to some Dragon Ball discussion videos or from learning more about YouTube and listening to Conan and Samir or creative support and every week I listen to the gamedev show so plenty of options to choose anything to enjoy on mile long however sometimes if I have some bug in my game that I just cannot solve or some random game design problem when that happens I don't take anything with me I find the time walking my dogs is absolutely excellent for General thinking and problem solving sometimes there's a problem that seems impossible to solve and suddenly after walking for a bit the solution becomes crystal clear as soon as I come back home it's back to work I might make some popcorn if I feel like a nice snack I eat lots of plain popcorn the whole day and also a bunch of this I don't know what is the exact name in English in Portuguese it's called Latina but in English I think gelatin is something completely different I think the correct word for this is jello anyways I'm definitely addicted to snacking I'm constantly eating so I try to eat low calorie foods come back to work this time it's pretty serious so I check out some nice complex sets on my game on this day I was working on the mechanics related to the operon system this is the world representation that is running while you're in a different world it's how the game keeps track of resources being generated in every world and transferred between them and when my brain starts to get foggy once again I change how I work usually in late afternoon I just grab my laptop and go somewhere else to work I go to a random coffee shop or the supermarket pretty much anywhere I can sit I use this time to either catch up and answer some more comments or research and write an upcoming video although once a week I don't actually work the whole afternoon something that I've been doing for over 10 years now is volunteering adding local dog shelter it's yet another thing that I do that does not involve sitting in front of the screen so it's yet another way that helps me avoid burnout I love dogs so it's really great to be able to go there help with the cleanup and feeding and of course play with them and here's a bonus fun fact the dogs that I have right now Tico and Teka they actually used to live in this shelter so I actually knew them for years before I ever adopted them I think they first went to shelter in about 2015 they are really great dogs but they are inseparable and there are not many people who want to adopt two ducks at once so they didn't live that the shelter pretty much their own lives and I saw them and played with them every time that I went there and then when my previous dog suddenly passed away in 2021 that's when I decided to adopt him so yeah doing this volunteer work at the shelter is really nice playing with dogs is yet another thing that doesn't inform screens at all and really helps me refresh so once again I really do believe this is yet another reason why I've never suffered from burnout then at the end of the afternoon at around 6 PM that is usually when my videos go live although this part is pretty automated I I watched a video and validate everything in the early afternoon then just set it to schedule to go live on both YouTube and my website the video emails on the website they're all sent automatically if you don't want to depend on the YouTube algorithm showing you videos you can set up your account on the website to receive emails at around 7 PM it's roughly dinner time although I don't actually normally eat a regular dinner like most people once again over time through experimentation I have learned what works for me and what doesn't growing up with my parents we always had a really heavy dinner around 9pm and I just found out that always made me really sluggish which then massively impacted my sleep so nowadays usually my dinner is really just some popcorn and some yogurt so something really light although keep in mind that definitely does not mean that I starve I simply eat a lot throughout the day in fact my big problem is always eating too much every day I normally eat around 3000 calories I then maybe do a little bit more work usually something wrong light perhaps just watching some videos for research or just entering some more comments and questions nothing too intense then at about a 30 I try to stop working although I still do some things somewhat related to work usually at this time it's when I like to watch videos from either a spider cat or wonderbots or orbital potato since I don't really have time to play games myself watching someone plays how I can keep up with all the awesome games that are coming out these three specific channels are really excellent if you're interested in the massive amount of indie games that come out each month again I watch them at about 23 X speed so a 40 minute video really just takes about 15 minutes I watch those as well as some random videos I like to watch a little bit of everything then around 9 9 30 then it's time for bed like I said I really don't sacrifice my sleep for anything so even though I do wake up pretty early I also go to bed very early I fall asleep and just get ready to do it all over again the next day all right so that's a day in my life I like making stepbystep tutorials so this is probably the most detailed in the life video that exists I hope you found it interesting to see how I managed my life hopefully some of this can be helpful to you although my main advice is really just experiment with yourself and figure out what works for you definitely do not just blindly copy my routine everyone is unique perhaps you work better at night perhaps it makes more sense for you to work out in the afternoon perhaps you prefer some like yoga overlifting or perhaps you prefer playing games instead of just watching them or perhaps you prefer solid and broken chunks of work instead of many breaks so really my best advice is really just do some experiments and figure out what works for you when you unload alright so now I gotta finish editing this video and get back to work I'm working really hard to make the best game that I can make the only state is just next week so stay tuned for that thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
