00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're considering to make
00:03 - a tool tip in unity we're going to take
00:05 - our tool tip and create a item stats
00:07 - window with various text fields and
00:09 - images let's begin
00:13 - so over here is the tooltip we have done
00:16 - so far it is great for displaying simple
00:18 - text to the player like the description
00:20 - of what each button does and extra
00:22 - information on each field as you can see
00:24 - it follows the mouse and we can update
00:26 - it in real time now in this video we
00:29 - want to reuse some of the code from
00:30 - distal tip to create a complex tone tip
00:33 - to shostats
00:33 - of these items in here so let's start
00:36 - off by making the complex tooltip in the
00:38 - editor we're going to duplicate our
00:40 - original tooltip comedy tooltip item so
00:44 - the first thing we need is a label for
00:46 - our name then we're also going to have a
00:49 - description of each item now we're going
00:51 - to position it going under the mouse so
00:54 - our tooltip is anchored on the lower
00:55 - left side and now for this one let's
00:57 - anchor it on the upper left side
01:18 - all right so this is the layout we're
01:20 - going with we have an item name then we
01:22 - have an atom description a image for the
01:25 - item and a bunch of stats that won't be
01:27 - different between each item okay so with
01:30 - our total created in the editor now
01:31 - let's take care of our class in order to
01:34 - do it we're going to start off by
01:35 - duplicating the total class that way we
01:38 - can reuse some code okay so we now have
01:42 - this class and now in here the code that
01:44 - we can reuse is the code for following
01:46 - the mouse and to make sure it does not
01:48 - leave the screen the whole difference
01:50 - here is our tool tip was anchored on the
01:52 - lower left side and now we are anchoring
01:54 - on the upper left side so in here
01:55 - instead of anchor position y plus we do
01:57 - a minus so just like that we should have
02:00 - our item stats tooltip correctly
02:02 - following the mouse now in the awake
02:04 - let's grab the reference to the various
02:06 - text fields okay so these are the
02:15 - various fields we have we have the name
02:16 - description and the various stats we no
02:19 - longer need to update in real time so we
02:20 - can remove this and on our show tooltip
02:23 - let's start off by making one where we
02:25 - only show the item name so start off
02:27 - things very simple in here we just set
02:30 - the name text text to be the item name
02:33 - okay we're not going to resize the
02:36 - background and here make the static
02:38 - version of this function which is just
02:40 - like this okay so our tooltip should be
02:47 - working for changing the item name so we
02:49 - can now go into the window in order to
02:51 - test this is the window that I have set
02:53 - up for testing it is a very basic window
02:56 - it just has some buttons which function
02:58 - and examine like these ones and on each
03:01 - button I have a simple component that
03:03 - contains the information out of each
03:04 - item this is the component that contains
03:07 - the information from each item it has a
03:09 - sprite a name description and these
03:11 - stats some script on the window let's
03:13 - first test it by using the tooltip item
03:16 - stats and add a tooltip let's add it to
03:20 - the first button
03:22 - and just say test item name okay so I
03:26 - see if our custom complex tooltip shows
03:28 - up when we pass the mouse over the first
03:30 - button okay here's the scene and there's
03:32 - the own tooltip still working perfectly
03:34 - fine and now when we pass the first
03:36 - button yep there you go there's our new
03:38 - complex tooltip being shown you can see
03:40 - that it has the test item name it has
03:42 - the layout we set and everything is
03:44 - working correctly all right so now
03:46 - obviously let's fill up the rest of the
03:48 - fields so we're going to change our show
03:50 - tooltip function now in here we need
03:52 - let's first receive a sprite for each
03:54 - item sprite then we get the item name
03:57 - then a string for the item description
03:59 - and then in for the stats so in here
04:03 - let's set all of our fields where's the
04:05 - name text and the description text okay
04:19 - so we now have our function receiving
04:21 - all the information that it needs so
04:22 - let's just update our static function
04:31 - and just like that our tooltip is now
04:33 - receiving all the information it needs
04:35 - so now let's go into the window items
04:37 - and again here in the editor just for
04:40 - testing I've had the item info component
04:42 - which contains all these fields
04:43 - so let's grab this for each button okay
04:58 - so we are cycling through our six
05:00 - buttons we grab the item info that is
05:03 - attached as a component to each of them
05:05 - and we add the tooltip onto that button
05:07 - using that items info all right so let's
05:10 - see if all of them are correctly showing
05:12 - their info okay so here we are and again
05:15 - the old tooltip still works perfectly
05:17 - fine and now when I pass over in item
05:20 - yep there you go there's all of these
05:22 - stats of each item being correctly
05:24 - updated it has an item name a
05:26 - description a image and the various
05:29 - stats none of them are
05:30 - dating correctly so as you can see we've
05:32 - reused the code to follow the mouse and
05:34 - keep the window on the screen which
05:36 - allowed this to make this complex
05:37 - relative very quickly and as you can see
05:40 - all the elements of the dynamic tooltip
05:42 - were created very simply so we could
05:44 - easily swap out the stats for bars
05:46 - instead of showing numbers so there you
05:48 - have it we took some code from our
05:50 - normal tooltip and made a complex item
05:52 - tooltips with multiple fields and images
05:54 - as always you can download the project
05:56 - files in utilities from unity code
05:57 - monkey comp if you have any questions
05:59 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
06:00 - best answer them subscribe for more

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're considering to make a tool tip in unity we're going to take our tool tip and create a item stats window with various text fields and images

stats some script on the window let's first test it by using the tooltip item stats and add a tooltip let's add it to the first button and just say test item name okay so I see if our custom complex tooltip shows up when we pass the mouse over the first button okay here's the scene and there's the own tooltip still working perfectly fine and now when we pass the first button yep there you go there's our new complex tooltip being shown you can see that it has the test item name it has the layout we set and everything is working correctly all right so now obviously let's fill up the rest of the fields so we're going to change our show tooltip function now in here we need let's first receive a sprite for each item sprite then we get the item name then a string for the item description and
