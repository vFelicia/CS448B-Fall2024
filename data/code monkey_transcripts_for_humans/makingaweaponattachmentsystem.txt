02:06 - thank you
02:22 - all right hey everyone how's it going
02:25 - all right thanks for being here
02:27 - let me know if everything is correct
02:28 - it's been quite a while since I lasted
02:30 - on live stream so hopefully in terms of
02:32 - tech everything is working correctly all
02:33 - right
02:43 - all right
02:45 - so hey everyone hey thanks for being
02:46 - here on this random Friday all right
02:48 - hope you're having a nice day okay so
02:51 - basically I got a bit of work that I
02:53 - wanted to do so I figured I might as
02:55 - well do it on a live stream so
02:57 - let's do this I'm basically going to try
02:59 - to do a weapon attachment system uh let
03:03 - me just hide the background
03:05 - all right so basically got a weapon and
03:08 - I want to modify the attachment so
03:09 - modify the stock the barrel the scope
03:12 - and so on so should be a fun system
03:15 - okay
03:17 - so let me
03:19 - just look at my to-do list everything
03:21 - seems fine and okay all right so I'm
03:23 - going to be
03:24 - film this out and feel free to ask any
03:26 - questions and I'll try them keep
03:28 - answering keep looking at chat and doing
03:29 - everything okay
03:31 - right so for the first task that I want
03:33 - I really want to
03:35 - just handle rotating the weapon so that
03:37 - should be a fun and easy one
03:40 - so let's start trying to make this a
03:43 - weapon attachment system
03:45 - start off by making a basic script
03:49 - s folder and inside let's do it same
03:53 - name and attach it
03:55 - all right
04:01 - stream quality is only 480 not 1080. is
04:03 - it
04:04 - is it for everyone because
04:07 - at least on my end it should be
04:09 - [Music]
04:14 - looking on the stream Health it says
04:15 - that it's healthy so
04:18 - okay so maybe there's a maybe just takes
04:20 - a while all right okay
04:22 - all right let's do this and yep
04:30 - all right I'm glad that it's looking
04:33 - good okay
04:34 - so first of all let me just make a void
04:37 - update
04:39 - and on update let me test input get
04:42 - mouse button
04:44 - uh no just Mouse button basically first
04:47 - of all I just want to rotate the weapon
04:49 - so let's see
04:51 - about local Singletons using SOS you
04:54 - mean like the the Ryan hippo script on
04:57 - object Tonk I think that one is
04:58 - interesting and definitely very very
05:00 - good when it comes to making a designer
05:03 - friendly workflow but personally for me
05:05 - I prefer using Code so for me I don't
05:07 - really use it but yeah if you do
05:09 - definitely go ahead and for those of you
05:11 - who don't know
05:13 - let me just put up the link it's
05:14 - actually a really great uh
05:16 - uh it was Ryan hippo I think that was
05:19 - his name
05:20 - let's pick the ball objects that was it
05:23 - the script ball object game architecture
05:25 - so if you don't know about it definitely
05:27 - go watch a tonk really great
05:30 - definitely a very interesting use case
05:31 - for more objects and how to design your
05:33 - games and on those kinds of things
05:37 - yeah this is going to be at least I
05:39 - think I put on the settings
05:41 - uh yeah it doesn't have DVR so yep this
05:45 - won't be record for afterwards
05:47 - all right okay so up here
05:49 - [Music]
05:49 - um
05:52 - trying to remember how do I get the
05:56 - the mouse position or the most danta I
05:59 - think that was it
06:05 - yeah I think that was it so private
06:07 - factor is this a two or three
06:10 - Z3
06:12 - for the last Mile's position
06:15 - and Vector 340 miles donta
06:19 - take the last Mouse position minus down
06:22 - let's just do a debug download just see
06:25 - what this says
06:27 - just a tub
06:29 - the input system is easier yeah probably
06:31 - I mean for me when I when I make some
06:33 - quick prototypes I only start with the
06:35 - with the Legacy input system just
06:38 - because I'm so used to it so just so
06:39 - automatic but yeah definitely that one
06:43 - is
06:43 - quite a bit all right I'm not updating
06:45 - are you from Portugal yep yes I am uh
06:49 - right so over here I need to update so
06:50 - the unless Mouse position equals input
06:53 - dot Mass position
06:55 - all right
06:56 - spider on your back wow that's scary
06:59 - let's hope not
07:02 - uh right so as I move
07:05 - yep okay that is working moving on the X
07:07 - and on the set all right great so let me
07:11 - grab the weapon
07:13 - so is there always film transform for
07:16 - the weapon transform
07:19 - so starting this one and basically I
07:22 - want to modify the Euler angles
07:24 - and I need to think how do I modify it
07:27 - let me go back
07:29 - over here so on the weapon where do I
07:32 - got this weapon
07:34 - so for rotating
07:36 - do I want yeah probably want the local
07:38 - but yeah so I want to rotate so that's
07:41 - on the Y and then a little bit on the X
07:44 - all right
07:45 - okay
07:47 - so
07:49 - uh so for the
07:52 - so for the x is going to be the most
07:54 - Delta dot Y and most down to dot X and
07:58 - then zero so something like this but
07:59 - obviously but uh rotate speed let's put
08:04 - it something really small otherwise it's
08:06 - going to be pretty massive
08:09 - so let's see
08:11 - it's not the interior another planet
08:14 - what
08:16 - thoughts about the ntai I think they I
08:19 - think it is really interesting the
08:20 - things that I saw behind closed doors at
08:22 - GDC they don't look very
08:25 - very interesting they're definitely
08:27 - going about it the right way I would say
08:28 - so I'm definitely very excited to see
08:30 - how that comes the most important thing
08:32 - is really how they're focusing on on
08:34 - owning their entire data set so that way
08:37 - as a game developer you don't have to be
08:39 - worried about being
08:40 - um
08:42 - you don't have to worry about being sued
08:44 - over anything because of because they
08:46 - don't own the
08:48 - the underlying data set or something so
08:50 - the fact they're focusing on that is
08:51 - actually super useful so I do think that
08:54 - is going to be quite nice
08:57 - uh
09:02 - oh did I make the
09:04 - welcome or angles
09:15 - but why is it did I not do
09:23 - because it is rotating in a strange way
09:31 - okay that's on
09:36 - just focus on the
09:38 - on the Y first
09:47 - all right make a video on full body FPS
09:50 - controller I would encourage you to to
09:54 - use the
09:55 - the uh
09:57 - what's it called the start assets
10:00 - I would definitely advise you to use
10:02 - those I mean there's no point in
10:04 - reinvent the wheel or at least open
10:06 - those and see how they've implemented
10:08 - for example on the third person shooter
10:10 - controller for that one I pretty much
10:11 - refactor that third person controller in
10:14 - order to make my own
10:15 - and yeah so I would say definitely do
10:17 - that instead of trying to build it on
10:19 - your own
10:20 - that is probably the best way
10:28 - oh is this not
10:37 - okay that's on
10:38 - [Music]
10:45 - why is it
10:48 - oh
10:53 - right so I actually need to update it
10:56 - afterwards yeah right I'm not updating
10:58 - every framing I thought that was strange
11:05 - yeah there you go so yeah
11:08 - thank you God might yep that was exactly
11:10 - it was not updating on every frame so
11:12 - like this yep now it does rotate exactly
11:14 - isn't done
11:15 - uh all right okay good so basically just
11:18 - something like this obviously cannot go
11:22 - way into that one so let me just
11:25 - the background the other one is going to
11:27 - rotate a little bit but
11:30 - let's see over here so I need to push it
11:32 - a bit more like this
11:34 - and just make it a a bit bigger just so
11:37 - that the background isn't visible
11:40 - all right so let's just copy this
11:42 - transform copy the component and paste
11:44 - it like this
11:46 - okay great all right
11:50 - so with that yep there you go I can
11:51 - rotate it like that let me also apply
11:54 - the other one
11:55 - so over here the mouse Delta dot y
11:57 - except for that one I really want to
12:00 - limit it but let's see how much do I
12:02 - clamp it
12:06 - as far as it's an out of issue with the
12:08 - UI I click can click on anything
12:11 - what do you mean click on anything with
12:13 - a first person controller you're not
12:15 - supposed to be
12:16 - clicking on anything so I'm not sure
12:19 - what you're trying to do
12:22 - basically in first person shouldn't be
12:25 - oh hey and you remember hey thank you
12:27 - ladies thank you that's nice I forgot
12:30 - that this every time I do a live stream
12:31 - I forget that these problems exist
12:35 - um yeah so basically if you're using an
12:36 - FPS controller then you have at some
12:38 - point you have to unlock the mouse if
12:40 - you actually want to click some buttons
12:41 - so you have to go into cursor and you
12:43 - have to set the lock State and by
12:45 - default you're probably going to have it
12:47 - as locked which means you can't see the
12:49 - cursor so you can't click on anything so
12:51 - you need to revert this one back into
12:52 - none so that you can actually see the
12:54 - cursor in order to be able to click on
12:56 - menus so that's pretty much the only
12:58 - thing you should need to do as long as
13:00 - the cursor is unlocked it should be able
13:01 - to click on any buttons so yeah I would
13:05 - assume that's the only issue uh right
13:08 - okay so this one is good except I don't
13:09 - want the weapon to rotate way too much
13:11 - just a little bit
13:13 - so let's see what kind of rotation is
13:15 - this uh let me get into the weapon
13:19 - I'll write this
13:21 - oh it's when I click on elsewhere okay
13:23 - sure yeah that works okay so I only want
13:25 - to go minus 15 to plus eight
13:30 - yeah minus 10 to 0.8 so I don't want to
13:32 - go way too much
13:33 - so math dot twimp dot clamp
13:39 - going for the
13:41 - float rotation y Min uh what did I say
13:45 - minus seven minus seven X rotation y Max
13:48 - let's say on plus 10 so clamp the mouse
13:54 - down to y
13:55 - between the rotation y Min and the
13:58 - rotation y Max
14:00 - so that's going to be the point for the
14:02 - rotation y
14:04 - EP and then I apply the rotation line
14:07 - actually it's rotation X I don't know
14:09 - why I was calling it y
14:10 - uh yep so over here let me put this one
14:14 - always rename your variables if
14:16 - something changes
14:19 - definitely always remember to do that
14:20 - okay all right hey super Channel thank
14:23 - you thanks for featuring minus near 10
14:25 - free assets oh that's awesome
14:27 - which one did you make
14:29 - nice all right I always go through it
14:32 - and always pick some interesting Essence
14:33 - and there's usually a lot of competition
14:35 - so if you made something and I sound
14:37 - like that means it was pretty good so
14:38 - all right congrats nice uh okay so this
14:41 - one
14:44 - it's a bit
14:47 - did I do LARP instead of no I did clamp
14:51 - oh right never mind yeah I'm doing it
14:53 - wrong I need to clamp the maximum not
14:55 - the thing that you actually
14:57 - modify so yeah it's actually I'm not
15:00 - going to go like this
15:01 - no actually take this I take the
15:05 - Oiler angles.x
15:08 - and I put it down
15:12 - and then do a new Vector three with this
15:14 - one then the weapon transform local dot
15:18 - y weapon transform local dot Z
15:23 - okay so basically on that one by the
15:25 - mouse down to dot why
15:27 - and okay I think that should be it
15:30 - all right
15:32 - how did you learn ninty by yourself
15:34 - making things on your own or from some
15:35 - YouTube channels well when I started
15:37 - learning that was in 2012 so back then
15:39 - there really weren't any uh YouTube
15:42 - channels so yeah I had to learn by
15:45 - myself pretty much that was
15:47 - it was tricky yeah lots of trial and
15:50 - error trying to search things look for
15:51 - c-sharp tutorials things on sack
15:53 - overflow and all those kinds of things
15:55 - so yeah it was definitely much stricter
15:57 - than it is nowadays nowadays you can
15:58 - just look at tons and tons of tutorials
16:00 - and you won't find tons of stuff but
16:03 - yeah back then I had to do it pretty
16:05 - much the hard way lots of trial and
16:06 - error reading documentation and so on so
16:08 - yeah definitely tricky definitely things
16:10 - are much easier nowadays
16:12 - okay
16:15 - why was this one not going at
16:20 - is this one is it the issue yeah I'm
16:22 - guessing this is going to be the issue
16:24 - with the yeah the alerts yeah they are
16:27 - they are manual So yeah thank you so
16:29 - much for the Super Chat and thank you so
16:30 - much new channel member that's nice uh
16:34 - right so basically my issue right now
16:36 - [Applause]
16:39 - thinking of making a horror game but
16:40 - don't know how to model well that's
16:42 - where assets come in which is the same
16:44 - thing for me I also don't know how to
16:45 - model so the way I do it is I use lots
16:49 - and lots of assets
16:51 - thanks only nowadays using us this yeah
16:54 - that's going to be the tricky thing ah
16:55 - crap I hate this uh
16:59 - damn it uh yeah so nowadays I would
17:01 - definitely encourage you to use some
17:03 - assets actually that's part of the
17:04 - reason why why I'm doing this is because
17:06 - the the Cindy store they've got a sale
17:09 - and basically the pack that I'm using
17:11 - here for the weapon attachment system is
17:13 - the one that is going to be on yep it's
17:15 - this one the military pack which is
17:17 - going to be 70 off next Monday
17:21 - so
17:23 - thanks did I call it
17:25 - Cindy store second link I don't remember
17:28 - uh
17:31 - nope
17:33 - dot Co
17:36 - Yeah so basically yeah that's why I'm
17:38 - doing this in order to use some assets
17:40 - because yeah I also don't know how to
17:42 - model so for me yeah I need to use some
17:45 - Assets in order to be able to do some
17:46 - interesting things but thankfully
17:47 - nowadays you can find assets and all
17:49 - kinds of things so yeah definitely buy
17:51 - it and use it to turn your vision into
17:53 - reality okay so the issue over here is
17:55 - that as I go up as usual always problems
17:57 - with oil or angles so it goes up and it
18:00 - snaps all the way down
18:01 - so how do I do this well I need to
18:04 - basically
18:05 - uh increase it by 316 Maybe
18:09 - that works
18:11 - so if I go 316f
18:14 - minus n360f what's that
18:17 - with this it should be like that I hope
18:24 - except no except that one is going to be
18:27 - ah crap
18:29 - actually going to be quite annoying how
18:31 - do you keep focused to finish a game
18:32 - basically you
18:34 - focus on using a nice to-do list so you
18:36 - always work from a plan so you define a
18:38 - plan to find the kinds of things that
18:40 - you want to do and you just do it day by
18:42 - day little by little every day that's
18:44 - pretty much it there's no secret answer
18:47 - you just have to try doing things do a
18:49 - tiny bit every single day and
18:52 - yeah just keep at it day over day that's
18:55 - the best thing that I can say is that
18:56 - the most important thing is really
18:58 - consistency so it doesn't matter if you
19:00 - work non-stop 12 hours a day that
19:02 - doesn't really matter what matters is
19:03 - working a tiny bit every single day for
19:05 - months on end that's pretty much it yep
19:07 - your game is the sum of 1 000 small
19:09 - success that is definitely a
19:12 - uh okay so this oh crap I always hate
19:15 - working with rotations and things always
19:19 - the issue uh okay so how do I
19:22 - fix this
19:24 - um
19:26 - okay let me think
19:29 - s uh local Oiler angles X
19:35 - equals this guy so
19:40 - I guess they can do if this one
19:42 - is bigger than
19:45 - is going to be 180.
19:47 - yeah I guess if it is bigger than 180
19:51 - then I can do minus equals
19:53 - 360.
19:56 - and with that like this it should
19:58 - hopefully be working so now I no longer
20:00 - need this
20:01 - I don't think
20:04 - so basically if that one goes above 180
20:06 - so if it goes in like 359 then it's
20:08 - going to subtract so it's going to go
20:09 - into negatives
20:11 - so hopefully this should work let's see
20:14 - well that's Chet CPT to get some rock
20:16 - out yeah actually that could possibly
20:18 - work but yep there you go finally
20:20 - figured it out so it's always the issues
20:22 - with going by 360 then it snaps back
20:24 - into zero and so on that is always super
20:26 - tricky but yeah thanks only does work so
20:28 - I can rotate One Direction another one
20:30 - only the axis is a bit on so I need to
20:33 - yeah rotate it on different but yep
20:35 - there you go that's exactly what I
20:36 - wanted so I want to be able to rotate
20:38 - the weapon maybe rotate it a little bit
20:40 - rotate a tiny bit up and down and just
20:42 - like that
20:43 - okay great let me just increase the
20:45 - rotation speed by a tiny bit just like
20:48 - this
20:49 - all right
20:52 - reassuring to see that even highly
20:54 - experience that I've done just code
20:55 - everything perfectly the first time yep
20:57 - that's exactly it I mean remember that
20:59 - when you see one of my videos what you
21:00 - see in the final video is the final
21:02 - thing after all the trial and error so
21:04 - yeah before I record the video I
21:06 - definitely go through this process I get
21:08 - a ton of issues in order to figure out
21:09 - what works and what doesn't so yeah
21:12 - just because you see the final video and
21:13 - everything goes well does not mean that
21:15 - I absolutely did it the first time no uh
21:18 - right okay so this part is working so
21:20 - that was just the basics just trying to
21:22 - make it rotate so that's fun okay so now
21:25 - let's actually do the proper attachment
21:26 - system
21:27 - so let me just see my notes because I
21:30 - was thinking about the design so
21:31 - basically I want some clickable buttons
21:34 - and I want them to be World buttons so
21:37 - that I can then
21:39 - I guess the thing is do I touch them
21:40 - inside or not that's a good question
21:45 - uh yeah I guess I could put them inside
21:47 - maybe try doing that so let's put inside
21:52 - put a canvas make it workspace maybe
21:55 - something like this
21:59 - so I'm going to have
22:01 - canvas and inside I'm going to have a UI
22:04 - button
22:07 - okay so let's put it really tiny
22:10 - and I'm going to want it to rotate to
22:13 - face the camera
22:15 - uh
22:17 - 0.5.1 you know that is way too big just
22:20 - get rid of the Sprite
22:22 - okay so basically I want a button that
22:24 - is going to be facing towards the camera
22:25 - so this is going to be the button for uh
22:28 - what am I going to count uh this is
22:30 - going to be for the barrel button
22:34 - okay something like this let's put it
22:37 - just a tiny bit
22:39 - okay and inside for the text let's say
22:42 - Baron
22:44 - put it in bold really tiny
22:47 - disable that and that where's the decks
22:51 - is it on the other side
22:53 - nope
22:56 - why did the font vanish
22:59 - that's all did I not importing
23:03 - text mesh Pro thing
23:08 - okay that's on
23:10 - so why the text mesh Pro not import the
23:13 - essentials
23:15 - that's range
23:17 - okay apparently oh never mind the window
23:20 - just showed up on my other screen that's
23:22 - why I didn't see it okay yeah that helps
23:25 - all right
23:27 - okay so let me select the font assets
23:29 - one of these two
23:36 - oh boy got some errors on the thing
23:41 - we create the game with JavaScript I
23:43 - mean this is Unity but yeah I guess in
23:45 - the past I have made some games using
23:47 - JavaScript
23:49 - that was uh actually I was trying mostly
23:52 - it was with PHP back when I wanted to
23:54 - make a a online game kind of like dark
23:57 - galaxy I really enjoyed playing that one
23:59 - that was really fun really interesting
24:03 - so
24:06 - so yeah I've definitely tried that
24:07 - record mug it sounds different well
24:09 - that's probably because I'm in I'm doing
24:11 - live streams so I'm not my voice is
24:13 - definitely different why is this guy not
24:15 - showing did I yeah bro yeah it messed up
24:18 - the Sprite asset okay so let me try
24:21 - doing oh crap I can't click under the
24:24 - people so let me just get read make new
24:27 - button Barrel button
24:30 - yeah the issue with the text mesh girl
24:32 - not showing up all right
24:35 - why have you been a Game Dev I've been
24:37 - using Unity since 2012.
24:40 - and I've been programming since I was
24:42 - about 10 so
24:43 - definitely been doing this for quite a
24:46 - long time
24:47 - uh right let me just
24:50 - grab the button
24:53 - actually ah crap sorry I can't read the
24:57 - messages right now I'm trying to
25:00 - yeah because the yeah because I should
25:02 - not rotate this guy I know instead just
25:05 - rotate the barrel thing
25:08 - and just need to make it a lot smaller
25:11 - than this
25:12 - and on the barrel button
25:20 - okay make it
25:22 - quite a bit more like this
25:26 - point
25:27 - two something like this all right okay
25:30 - finally ah crap I offset it no put it
25:33 - down there
25:35 - this one
25:37 - okay all right so that was quite a bit
25:39 - tricky actually
25:41 - because of the thing all right okay hey
25:44 - thank you for the Super Chat tunneler I
25:46 - was wondering if you have are planning
25:48 - to make an updated yinty analytics video
25:50 - yeah
25:52 - yeah there is a I did Cover analytics
25:54 - and there's a lecture there but yeah
25:56 - that lecture was
25:58 - quite a while ago and in the past few
26:00 - months they completely refactored it so
26:02 - yeah I definitely need to do that one
26:04 - right now because I haven't yet looked
26:06 - into how the new analytics Works what
26:08 - exactly changed I assume quite a lot of
26:10 - things change so yeah I'll definitely
26:13 - so yeah that's definitely part of the
26:15 - plan just don't know when I'll be able
26:17 - to do it that's always the it's always a
26:18 - tricky thing especially with that course
26:20 - which is should I spend my limited time
26:23 - on updating own lectures or covering new
26:25 - tools that is always the tricky question
26:28 - that always have trouble answering so
26:31 - yeah definitely part of the plan since
26:34 - that one is pretty much outdated so yeah
26:36 - that lecture hopefully soon I'll be able
26:38 - to update at least just down uh okay so
26:41 - look at the camera
26:44 - let me just make this one super simple
26:47 - one
26:48 - late update and over here let's see the
26:52 - trends form dot forward and I never
26:55 - remember if it's before it or not
26:57 - forward camera dot main transform.4 I'm
27:01 - pretty sure it's reversed I'm pretty
27:03 - sure that's how it's supposed to be
27:05 - okay
27:06 - it's gonna be an escape from tarkov yeah
27:08 - pretty much that is the one that I used
27:10 - as reference in order to figure out
27:13 - which one I should do so yep that's
27:16 - definitely the kind of thing that I'm
27:17 - going for
27:19 - all right
27:22 - did the kitchen chaos course and want to
27:24 - know if I can turn it into a co-op game
27:27 - yes when the the second part of that
27:30 - game second part of that course is on
27:32 - taking that game and converting into
27:34 - multiplayer so yes if you haven't
27:37 - done it yet definitely go ahead and
27:39 - follow the
27:40 - the free multiplier section so follow
27:42 - that one and if you can make it into a
27:45 - co-op game
27:46 - all right
27:48 - okay so basically yep it is working
27:50 - except apparently I did want the
27:52 - opposite
27:54 - so now reverse but just facing like that
27:56 - and this one also needs to be
27:58 - quite a bit smaller so let's put it
28:00 - maybe on point
28:02 - 3.1 we're going to have to
28:05 - modify all of this
28:08 - okay
28:10 - Barrel quite a bit tiny that's the issue
28:12 - with these it's kind of hard to
28:15 - crawl in order to be able to find but
28:17 - anyways sure okay so that works all
28:19 - right
28:19 - okay so thanks so much summer for the
28:21 - Super Chat yeah thank you all right so
28:24 - basically
28:25 - I got my canvas and I want and I want to
28:28 - be able to click on this button
28:31 - so
28:33 - let me go into the definitely going to
28:36 - need to refactor quite a lot of this I
28:39 - gotta say that writing code once on live
28:41 - stream it's quite a bit trickier my
28:43 - brain definitely works much much slower
28:45 - it's definitely much trickier to do
28:48 - things
28:50 - so yeah doing it on the live stream
28:52 - complicates things can I use your
28:54 - Utilities in the game I want to sound
28:55 - same yep feel free to use the utilities
28:57 - in your own games free or commercial yep
28:59 - go ahead I hope they help you in your
29:02 - game okay so the barrel button
29:06 - let me just actually I just want to test
29:08 - if I can actually click on the button
29:11 - yes or no
29:14 - so on the barrel button on click add in
29:17 - listener
29:19 - and over you just debug.log in order to
29:22 - bear on them
29:25 - all right
29:29 - how do you handle dealing with
29:30 - encountering games that are similar to
29:32 - the one you are working on uh the answer
29:34 - is don't worry about it pretty much I
29:35 - mean you can have two people that come
29:38 - up with the exact same uh design and
29:41 - even if you do two people that come up
29:42 - with the same design over the building
29:44 - of the game The Funnel games will be
29:46 - completely different so yeah I would say
29:48 - definitely don't worry about it unless
29:50 - you're actively trying to make a clone
29:52 - it it won't come out exactly the same
29:55 - thing so definitely don't worry about
29:57 - that if someone has a similar idea go
29:59 - ahead make your own
30:00 - whatever you do it is going to end up
30:02 - being quite different so yeah don't
30:04 - worry about that
30:06 - all right okay so the button does work I
30:08 - can select the barrel yeah that's one
30:10 - all right okay so let me
30:13 - uh okay so I got the basics
30:16 - I can rotate I can do a thing and now
30:18 - the main thing that I want is
30:20 - the parts okay so let's start by making
30:23 - the weapon part so can you see Sharp
30:25 - script weapon part so
30:28 - let's go inside and this one is going to
30:30 - be a script mode object with a create
30:32 - asset menu
30:34 - and okay so for this one let me see what
30:38 - do I need for it
30:41 - right I'm going to need a poem for the
30:44 - part type
30:47 - this is where I'm going to
30:50 - uh the final things okay so let's see
30:53 - I'm going to have a barrel then a barrel
30:54 - end
30:56 - then an under Barrel a stock a grip and
31:01 - a magazine something like that
31:04 - okay and for the parts I'm going to make
31:07 - it a problem with part type
31:10 - and the part type
31:12 - and then I guess if only transformed for
31:15 - the prefab that I'm going to instantiate
31:16 - okay
31:17 - I used to like the White theme because
31:20 - dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty
31:22 - much it if I put this on dark mode I
31:24 - couldn't stare it for more than three
31:25 - seconds so
31:27 - sorry but yep for me it has to be like
31:30 - that objects
31:35 - okay and inside let's make a weapon part
31:37 - so
31:39 - let's make it a barrel
31:42 - and actually let's start with the grip
31:44 - because that one is
31:45 - probably going to be easier so start
31:48 - with the grip and let's see all the
31:50 - parts that I got
31:53 - so we're here seeing all the assets You
31:55 - Can't customize the snow let's go oh
31:57 - yeah yeah I forgot about it but yeah
31:59 - definitely going to be able to customize
32:01 - the scope as well yep uh okay so for the
32:05 - grip that one
32:07 - should be the easiest one so this one
32:09 - has three separate grips okay so let's
32:12 - start by doing that what are the names
32:14 - grip one two three that's it
32:17 - yep okay so on this one let's call this
32:20 - script one
32:22 - grip two and grip three
32:25 - okay now the tricky thing about this
32:29 - kind of system is going to be how do I
32:32 - position them
32:34 - yeah because basically
32:36 - so the way these assets are set up
32:40 - so the body is like that but I actually
32:42 - want the body to be a bit more offset
32:46 - because right now the rotation is a bit
32:49 - strange
32:51 - so let me grab all of these
32:55 - and try to move them just a little bit
32:59 - just because yeah the body's supposed to
33:02 - be kind of like that okay good let me
33:04 - actually move it kind of like this all
33:06 - right uh okay so
33:09 - for the body nice and missions to show
33:12 - the chat messages yeah nice if you want
33:14 - to know I actually covered it on the
33:17 - oh God I always forget the
33:20 - yeah I actually didn't notice the
33:22 - message down here
33:23 - because there is you can customize your
33:26 - character on your live stream except I
33:28 - don't remember the oh God I always
33:31 - forget this one
33:32 - so
33:34 - customize
33:36 - live stream character yeah I don't think
33:39 - that's it I'm not gonna remember oh crap
33:41 - it shows up down here the link to
33:43 - customize it I always forget this this
33:45 - is always a thing that I forget but yeah
33:46 - basically you can customize your
33:47 - character and in there it also showcased
33:49 - all the all the things that you oh crap
33:52 - why can't I remember it
33:54 - I always forget that one I always forget
33:56 - what it's called
33:57 - uh
34:02 - nope
34:04 - damn it
34:08 - so I can figure out okay So eventually
34:11 - it's going to pop up the message down
34:12 - here so when it does let's see uh
34:15 - anyways Okay so
34:17 - I want to modify start off by modifying
34:20 - that one so
34:23 - uh okay yeah
34:25 - basically I'm trying to think of how am
34:27 - I going to policy points
34:29 - so this is going to be what am I calling
34:32 - it the grip
34:34 - so these are going to be the attach
34:37 - points so let's put inside attach points
34:41 - put down on zero and then put the grip
34:44 - is the grip on the position yep and
34:46 - basically essentially where's the grip
34:48 - let me grab a grip this one is the mod a
34:51 - mod a grab a grip
34:54 - put it in there
34:56 - yeah I think that's supposed to be the
34:58 - position and just get rid of the grip on
35:00 - this one and yep that does work okay
35:03 - right so on these Ripple objects let me
35:06 - assign the prefabs and actually for the
35:08 - prefabs
35:10 - I'm going to one no I can use like this
35:13 - one right now
35:15 - okay so let's put grip one
35:18 - then the grip two
35:22 - and finally the grip three
35:26 - oh grip three all right okay so for the
35:30 - weapon itself let me
35:32 - link up on the weapon attachment system
35:34 - let me put another transform for this
35:38 - one is going to be the grip attach point
35:48 - great Eternal thanks oh that's awesome
35:49 - I'm quite the videos have helped you
35:52 - okay so for the grip touch points okay
35:58 - and the way that I'm going to oh
36:01 - yeah player customization tutorial yeah
36:04 - I think that's
36:05 - is that the link
36:14 - does it work nope it's something like
36:17 - that but yeah I can't remember exactly
36:19 - what it is
36:22 - or maybe
36:26 - nope
36:29 - nope or yes all right it is
36:32 - all right yeah
36:35 - thank you for your home who was it weird
36:38 - sweaty yeah thanks for the help yeah
36:40 - it's uh
36:42 - yeah that is the one I always forget
36:45 - that
36:46 - that link I really need to add some
36:48 - clickable link somewhere so anyways yeah
36:50 - you can customize your character and
36:54 - yeah at the bottom down here if you want
36:55 - to know how I made this yeah basically
36:57 - this is a transparent TNT window then
37:00 - for the characters they are controlled
37:01 - using some mesh based animations and the
37:03 - way that this is interacting with the
37:05 - YouTube API is through an HTTP request
37:07 - from inside unity and if you want to see
37:09 - more on how I color the colored all of
37:11 - these random uh characters those are
37:14 - pretty much the same code that I used in
37:15 - my game battle round Tycoon so you can
37:17 - see you can watch all these tutorials
37:19 - and figure out how all this works and
37:21 - maybe make your own if you also do some
37:23 - live streams or want to do something fun
37:25 - yeah this should help okay right
37:29 - uh okay so over here how do I
37:32 - just think you have a private a
37:34 - dictionary a dictionary of weaponpart as
37:38 - so dot part type
37:39 - and then the transform
37:43 - so for the weapon part type transform
37:46 - dictionary
37:49 - okay do a new one
37:52 - and up here let's see a red void set
37:56 - parts
37:58 - and what part am I going to put so
38:01 - not part time so the part type
38:05 - and
38:07 - wait do I do part type or
38:10 - no yeah because the thing already has
38:12 - the parts so if I just put a weapon for
38:15 - this so
38:17 - if I just do this one then I can go into
38:21 - the dictionary on this weapon part so
38:24 - that part type
38:25 - and basically I'm going to instantiate
38:29 - so transform for the part transform
38:32 - and I'm going to instantiate go into the
38:34 - weapon part instantiate the prefab
38:36 - okay
38:38 - all right
38:40 - so the weapon part type is this one but
38:42 - I also need to do some cleanup
38:44 - so if this one dot contains this key
38:49 - if it does already contain ducky
38:52 - then I need to destroy that one so I
38:55 - need to destroy this one dot game object
38:59 - okay so I destroyed that one I spawn the
39:01 - new one I put it and then I just need to
39:03 - actually position it so over here let's
39:06 - make a struct what am I going to call it
39:09 - part type
39:11 - attach point
39:14 - and I'm going to power the public weapon
39:16 - part so that part type for the part type
39:19 - and then a public transform for the
39:22 - attach Point transform
39:25 - and I gotta make this a serializer bone
39:28 - in order to show up
39:29 - and up here make a serialized field
39:33 - what's your own
39:34 - serialized film of part-time attach
39:37 - Point Let's see analyst of this one cell
39:40 - part type attach Point list
39:43 - okay so this way I can have the list
39:47 - and then over there I can
39:50 - or not for each uh
39:54 - first of all let me just
39:56 - fill out the array okay
39:59 - all right hello from Sweden hey nice
40:02 - what time is it in Sweden what is it
40:04 - like what is one plus two
40:06 - so it should be around what 2PM over
40:09 - there so that's nice uh okay so we're
40:12 - here for the part attach Point let me
40:15 - add one and I'm going to put it for the
40:17 - grip
40:19 - and for the group attached point it is
40:21 - this one right here
40:23 - okay
40:25 - that's a good question do I put it as a
40:27 - child or not I'm not sure 12 47 oh so
40:31 - it's really just one hour
40:33 - really
40:34 - huh I thought it was a bit more since
40:36 - Sweden is quite a bit more to write
40:38 - where I'm in yes 18 okay interesting
40:44 - all right so
40:46 - uh let me also make
40:50 - yeah a dictionary of the
40:54 - trying to think uh weapon tart
40:58 - attach Point transform dictionary
41:02 - and over here let me make a new one and
41:05 - then do a four each a four each on this
41:08 - guy right here for the part type attach
41:11 - point and the part type attached
41:14 - pointless then I go into this guy and I
41:17 - access it on the part-time
41:18 - touchpoint.part type and I put it equals
41:21 - to the part-time attach Point dot the
41:24 - transform okay so that way I assign the
41:27 - transform and then down here I can do a
41:30 - transform for the attach Point transform
41:34 - and on this one basically
41:37 - I can grab the transform for the part
41:40 - type and the part type is going to be
41:42 - this webinesso.par type so with that one
41:45 - I have that one and over here dot parent
41:48 - I can put it as a channel that down and
41:51 - then put that local or angles equals
41:53 - Vector 3.0
41:55 - and same thing for the oil composition
41:57 - also Vector 3.0 all right brings from
42:01 - peterborg all right nice uh okay so
42:05 - for testing let me make a simple
42:09 - weapon part so weapon part so and let's
42:14 - go one and two just for testing so I get
42:17 - two of them and then over here on update
42:20 - lets you
42:21 - so if input get key down and let's go
42:25 - with the T king so I'm taking step apart
42:28 - and going the weapon part so one
42:31 - and on the Y
42:34 - let's go with set part SO2
42:37 - all right so let's see that
42:40 - how can I learn to code in a good way
42:42 - well watch tutorials and more
42:44 - importantly actually do the things
42:46 - that's pretty much it don't just blindly
42:49 - copy paste code actually try to try to
42:52 - follow things try to do things so I want
42:54 - you to turn on then try to make it on
42:56 - your own modify the code see what
42:57 - changes and yeah that's pretty much it
42:59 - there's really no secret for how do you
43:01 - learn how to code how do you learn how
43:03 - to make games it really is you just try
43:05 - to do it and then keep on doing it okay
43:09 - I think I forgot one thing
43:11 - did I
43:14 - yeah I did sort of forget one I just
43:17 - forgot to uh where's the what am I
43:20 - clicking on
43:22 - oh is that one spawning two of them
43:25 - yeah because there's the default one
43:27 - over the Oh okay that's unintentional
43:31 - why did that one
43:33 - huh because whenever I click outside and
43:36 - then click back it sometimes does
43:38 - something oh look at that wow that's on
43:42 - huh
43:44 - it kind of like why there's reverse
43:48 - why did that one go into -180
43:50 - all right that's strange yeah it only
43:53 - basically this is one of those weird
43:55 - bugs that only happens in the editor
43:57 - basically if this was a build actually
43:59 - if it was a building it would still
44:00 - possibly work because you could always
44:01 - click away but yeah basically the issue
44:04 - is with the delta
44:06 - so if I click outside and then click
44:08 - there that's funny
44:11 - all right that's not supposed to happen
44:12 - but sure uh actually I can
44:17 - sort of fix that can
44:20 - by making the I could clamp the mouse
44:23 - don't they
44:24 - except which one is I don't know anyways
44:26 - I'll I'll fix that later right now I
44:29 - really want to make sure that this part
44:31 - at least is working and yep it is
44:32 - working so I can swap out I can click a
44:34 - button and yep it does
44:36 - sup up down
44:38 - let's just make the third one just for
44:40 - fun
44:42 - so I got that one
44:44 - right now just based on key input but
44:47 - yep that's about it so the one thing
44:49 - that I do need
44:50 - is to get rid of the one that is on here
44:53 - right away
44:54 - so this one just disabled it so right
44:57 - now there's no grip
45:00 - then I click
45:01 - I said I don't like Co routines you use
45:03 - async methods and test instead no but
45:05 - that is also a valid option for me
45:07 - usually I just use basic uh flow timers
45:10 - so just count on the time I've got a
45:13 - class that is super useful in my
45:14 - utilities that I use it all the time and
45:17 - I made a video about it a long time ago
45:19 - so the function timer Yeah so basically
45:21 - this is the whenever I want to do some
45:23 - time based logic I just use a basic fold
45:25 - timer but yep if you do like using async
45:28 - and a weight then you have definitely go
45:29 - ahead and do that because that is
45:31 - pretty easy
45:33 - but application is focus work to fix
45:35 - that uh not really because the issue
45:37 - isn't that it loses Focus the issue is
45:39 - that it keeps track of the last uh the
45:42 - last position so over here the last
45:45 - Mouse position so this one grabs the
45:47 - input that Mouse position and when it
45:49 - loses Focus this one stops updating I
45:51 - don't know I think this one returns zero
45:53 - So based on the issues go go out of
45:54 - focus and you go back into focus and the
45:57 - input Mouse position difference between
45:58 - that one and the last one is going to be
46:00 - huge and for some reason that is causing
46:02 - that one to flip 180 so that's a bit
46:04 - strange so yeah basically the solution
46:05 - would be just make sure to limit the
46:07 - mouse Delta
46:09 - just limit it to a certain amount and
46:11 - that way it wouldn't cause issues on
46:12 - moving normally and when snapping from a
46:15 - huge distance it would clamp so it
46:16 - wouldn't cause problems so basically
46:18 - that would be the fix but yeah right now
46:20 - I really want to just make sure this
46:21 - part is working and obviously I forgot
46:23 - one thing but yep
46:26 - so on the weapon system you gotta put
46:28 - the grip three
46:30 - yep all right so the basics is kind of
46:33 - working there you go look at that all of
46:36 - them swapping nice
46:37 - can I use 22 or wait for LTS yep I would
46:40 - say definitely use 22 nowadays it's the
46:42 - version that I'm always using so yep the
46:45 - LTS should be coming out
46:47 - where are we we're at the end of April
46:50 - right yeah usually the LTS version comes
46:53 - around apron so yeah I guess the LTS
46:55 - version should be right around the
46:57 - corner pretty much
46:59 - uh okay so instead of being on things
47:02 - let's put it based on a button
47:05 - so on this one that's kind of tricky
47:07 - thing I'm going to have to make
47:09 - could I use just one canvas that's a
47:12 - good question I actually don't know
47:15 - would that work
47:18 - because multiple canvas is going to be
47:20 - make it quite a bit tricky so for this
47:23 - one let's call the grip button
47:25 - and instead of putting the look at let
47:28 - me see because I actually don't know if
47:30 - this is going to work or not let's try
47:32 - putting a look at camera on these two
47:35 - instead of on the canvas
47:37 - and that way I can have just one canvas
47:40 - let's see if it works
47:42 - I have like that actually does work all
47:44 - right nice so that's exactly what I want
47:46 - okay
47:47 - so on this one down here it is not the
47:49 - barrel but we're at the grip
47:52 - and when I click on it I want to modify
47:55 - it so up here
47:56 - let me grab the button I'm probably
47:58 - going to eventually refactor this code
48:00 - separate the UI from the actual weapon
48:02 - logic but yep
48:03 - you are the champ you got me into Game
48:05 - Dev
48:06 - let's start off with program now working
48:07 - on Local web dev
48:10 - as a front-end view.js all right awesome
48:13 - hey that's really awesome it's really
48:15 - great how programming is really such a
48:18 - global thing so yeah you can start from
48:19 - one area and end up in something
48:21 - completely different so yeah that's
48:23 - awesome yeah I hope you're enjoying your
48:25 - job that's a great story nice yeah
48:27 - JavaScript is one of those things that I
48:29 - if I had the time I would love to be
48:31 - able to explore it I pretty much just
48:32 - know the basics I know there are so many
48:34 - tons and tons of JavaScript Frameworks
48:37 - and yeah I will definitely that is one
48:39 - area that I would love to research if I
48:41 - can find time but yeah I can wear ads on
48:43 - getting into programming getting a job
48:44 - that's really awesome nice
48:46 - all right okay so I've got the brick
48:49 - button
48:50 - and okay let me just make this one so
48:53 - grip button on click at The Listener
48:55 - and for this one let me make a function
48:59 - so probably change grip
49:02 - and on this one up here let's go put
49:06 - that one on the
49:07 - change the grip okay
49:11 - so on this one I want to modify the grip
49:13 - and how do I
49:15 - oh that's actually yeah I'm gonna need
49:17 - hmm
49:19 - yeah actually a different
49:22 - uh dictionary
49:26 - stone is the attach point that one is
49:28 - the spawn thing
49:31 - hmm
49:35 - I'm trying to think do I make different
49:37 - structs or do I put them all on the same
49:39 - one
49:40 - it's actually a good question I'm
49:41 - actually not entirely sure
49:48 - all right let's put it here and then if
49:50 - needed I can just refactor it okay so
49:53 - the spawn transform and inside I'm also
49:56 - going to have the weapon part to so
49:58 - weapon part is so
50:01 - okay so those are supposed to start off
50:03 - as empty
50:06 - and on this dictionary I'm actually
50:07 - going to make it a dictionary of the
50:09 - attach point
50:11 - but then actually hmm
50:15 - not yet
50:18 - because I got the attach point and I got
50:20 - the things okay so let me
50:22 - just refactor this because yeah I think
50:24 - that I probably
50:26 - only needs that one right so
50:31 - instead of getting that one put down on
50:33 - this guy right here okay and then get
50:36 - rid of this second dictionary and now
50:38 - down here
50:40 - I go into this guy
50:42 - if this guy contains that part and
50:47 - this guy oh crap and this one dot the
50:52 - spawn transform is not known if it is
50:55 - not known then that's what I want to
50:57 - destroy I want to destroy the spawn
50:58 - transform okay and then you go into the
51:01 - part transform you spawn a brand new one
51:03 - all right then you go inside this
51:05 - dictionary on that one and on the spawn
51:07 - transform you put it as down
51:11 - can I modify the return value oh crap I
51:14 - only saved this it's always annoying uh
51:17 - so what do you call this thing
51:19 - or type attach Point whatever touch
51:22 - Point equals this guy right here
51:25 - and then the part type attach Point
51:27 - that's one transform equals down I guess
51:31 - you should probably make that one a
51:32 - class instead of a struct that would
51:33 - probably solve this problem anyways fine
51:37 - and the attachment point transform it is
51:39 - going to be this one dot the attach
51:42 - Point transform I put down on that one
51:45 - and then I just need to make sure to
51:47 - update this one
51:49 - yeah I think I should probably just make
51:50 - that one a class so that I don't need to
51:52 - worry about copies and so on but anyways
51:56 - okay so it isn't like this now I've got
51:58 - a structure that has all the data that I
52:00 - want
52:01 - so with this basic refactor hopefully
52:03 - everything should still be working the
52:05 - same
52:06 - so let's see
52:07 - after a night shift Shawarma IPA
52:10 - programming stream oh that's nice that's
52:13 - a very busy day huh
52:16 - uh right for example it's not yeah I
52:18 - forgot to assign the grip button
52:21 - that's not the one that's the one the
52:24 - grip button all right okay just
52:26 - wondering why did you choose struct over
52:28 - class just because usually when it's for
52:30 - groups of data that are only supposed to
52:32 - hold down for that one usually I just go
52:35 - with
52:37 - uh for that usually I go with struck
52:40 - just because just honestly they're
52:42 - usually in most cases there's there's no
52:45 - reason you can use another one so yeah
52:47 - it's really just habit whenever I just
52:49 - want to start some data I just tend to
52:51 - go without anyway so this is now working
52:54 - so that's fun and I just need to put on
52:57 - this one so I spawn it I position it and
53:00 - then on this one for the weapon partner
53:02 - so equals this one so this way I know
53:04 - what weapon is attached to that one okay
53:08 - so now when I change the grip
53:11 - uh I guess things I'm going to need an
53:13 - Esso for all of the enlists hello there
53:16 - hey both of you nice thanks for being
53:17 - here
53:19 - what's your real name my real name is
53:21 - Hugo
53:22 - how you doing yeah I'm doing great yeah
53:23 - thank you all for being here on this
53:25 - random live stream
53:27 - on this random Friday morning
53:29 - thanks for being here uh
53:32 - okay I'll make a weapon part list as so
53:39 - and for this one I'm going to want to
53:42 - make a scriptable object with a create
53:44 - asset menu
53:46 - and now inside of it I'm going to want
53:49 - to on the enlist the weapon parts so
53:52 - weapon part SL list and then basically I
53:55 - want a public list of weapon part so
53:58 - yeah this one could probably be
54:01 - yeah it could be fixed but I think
54:03 - making it Dynamic makes a bit more sense
54:05 - so get weapon part as soon list and I'm
54:08 - going to take a printer of type part
54:11 - type
54:12 - like this so list of weapon parts so
54:16 - weapon part so list
54:19 - actually instead of giving it the same
54:21 - name because everything can be a bit
54:22 - confusing
54:23 - so return weapon part as some list and
54:26 - eventually I'm going to return this one
54:28 - and I'm going to do a for each on weapon
54:31 - part so weapon part is so in the weapon
54:33 - partisan list and if this weapon part is
54:36 - so not part type if it matches the one
54:39 - that I'm looking for then on the return
54:41 - weapon partisan list let's add this one
54:43 - and return it okay so this way I've got
54:46 - a nice
54:47 - function to return it which is going to
54:49 - describing objects and let me make the
54:51 - weapon part so list or list this so I
54:55 - guess
54:56 - so on this one and let's select this one
54:59 - and add the three grips
55:01 - okay great so now if I go
55:05 - on to the other one
55:07 - ever facing lots of data when using
55:09 - public properties within scriptable
55:10 - objects
55:12 - uh no but then I never use property so
55:16 - maybe that's why
55:18 - really do you lose that that's a bit
55:20 - interesting yeah with assembly
55:22 - definitions okay yeah I don't know
55:24 - because for me when it comes to scribble
55:25 - objects I'll use them as read-only uh
55:28 - data containers so for me I always make
55:30 - them as public variables yeah over here
55:33 - I never use any
55:35 - any property so I never had that issue
55:38 - that is definitely very strange
55:43 - can I recommend the fix for a third
55:44 - person shooter animation rigging close
55:46 - to one problem well the solution is use
55:48 - a separate camera
55:49 - so kind of like how I did on the on the
55:53 - recent on the drag racing mini game
55:55 - versus why is this so smart uh no
55:58 - problem I'm gonna have to yeah
56:01 - ah crap
56:03 - so over here how I made the there's a
56:05 - camera for the actual game scene and
56:07 - then there's a separate camera for the
56:09 - UI so in order to prevent a shooter I'm
56:13 - actually only now I know you said third
56:14 - person shooter yeah basically I was
56:16 - talking about in first person so in
56:18 - first person you use a camera just to
56:19 - run the weapon and the camera to run the
56:21 - thing in front and then you just stack
56:23 - the weapon and that way the weapon will
56:24 - never clip through the geometry in third
56:28 - person shooter yeah for that one you
56:29 - were only just uh
56:31 - do a raycast in order to find the
56:33 - distance to the wall and if the wall is
56:34 - way too close and you basically just use
56:36 - another animation where the character
56:37 - kind of lifts up the weapon that's
56:39 - pretty much it
56:40 - so for that one it would just be based
56:42 - on animation rather than anything more
56:44 - complex
56:45 - okay right so what was I doing I was
56:48 - trying to modify that one so let me go
56:51 - into the
56:53 - weapon attachment system and when I
56:55 - click on that one
56:56 - let me just grab a reference to the
56:58 - weapon what did I call it
57:01 - the weapon partner SSO
57:04 - so the weapon part is so and on this one
57:08 - basically when I click in order to
57:09 - modify the grip so first I need to know
57:11 - what grip am I using
57:14 - so for that let's go into this one on
57:17 - that part type
57:18 - can I assume that this one actually
57:20 - exists
57:21 - yeah I think I can make that assumption
57:23 - because this transform dictionary
57:25 - yeah I'm always going to need to add the
57:27 - attach point so I can actually make the
57:28 - assumption that this one exists so I
57:30 - don't need to constantly be checking for
57:32 - that one
57:33 - uh okay so the part type weapon part is
57:36 - so part type dot in this case that's the
57:38 - grip
57:40 - so I'm going to grab
57:43 - so that's the attach point and then
57:47 - yeah and then from this one
57:51 - I'm going to basically
57:53 - yeah check the weapon part of so
57:56 - so if this one is known that means
57:58 - there's none so if so then I'm going to
58:01 - set parts and I'm going to go into the
58:05 - weapon partly so in order to get the
58:07 - weapon partisan list and I'm going to
58:09 - pass in a grip so I'm going to grab the
58:11 - list of groups and from this one I'm
58:14 - going to grab the very first grip
58:16 - so if there's no weapon then it's going
58:18 - to set down
58:19 - and if there is one then in next index
58:23 - so I'm going to first need to get the
58:26 - part index
58:28 - so for the part index I'm going to have
58:30 - to get
58:32 - this guy right here so it's going to be
58:33 - a list of weapon parts so weapon part
58:36 - that's a list
58:37 - so I grabbed that one and list of weapon
58:39 - parts from that one
58:41 - and then I do a index of and try to find
58:44 - the weapon that is currently on there so
58:47 - that is the important index so for the
58:49 - next part index that one take the part
58:52 - index plus one view a remainder of the
58:54 - weapon part list
58:56 - no not this one weapon part as soon as
58:59 - yeah I gotta be careful not to mix them
59:02 - both and do down like that and the next
59:06 - part index
59:08 - so I basically go into this one and exit
59:11 - on the next index
59:15 - okay I think that should do it this one
59:17 - is clicking so like nuts
59:19 - all right let's see
59:23 - uh what am I doing
59:26 - what's your opinion on test driven
59:27 - development
59:28 - I don't necessarily do test driven in
59:31 - the sense that I don't normally write
59:32 - tests but yep I definitely do find it I
59:36 - find the logic of focusing on it
59:38 - worrying about it I find that to be
59:39 - actually very
59:41 - oh this one is not uh I find it to be
59:43 - very useful to actually think about it
59:45 - so once personally I don't really
59:48 - usually uh write tests for my games I
59:50 - definitely do make sure that any code
59:52 - that I write I try to make it so that it
59:54 - would be possible to test it
59:56 - so I don't necessarily fully follow this
59:59 - driven development but yeah making sure
60:00 - that your code could be testable
60:03 - just having that in the back of your
60:04 - mind that will definitely help you make
60:06 - quite a lot better code
60:08 - all right look at that I can modify the
60:10 - grip that's cool
60:12 - okay nice so the barrel that one's
60:13 - actually going to be the trickiest one
60:15 - so I don't know why I started on that
60:16 - one
60:18 - uh but yeah
60:20 - all right so I can modify the grip so
60:21 - let's just add the buttons for the other
60:23 - ones
60:24 - and actually yeah just with that
60:27 - most of the system I don't already be
60:29 - working nice
60:31 - python Dove when I started Game Dev on
60:33 - your channel you don't like the brackets
60:34 - of my Game Dev Journey that's nice all
60:36 - right I'm glad my videos have come to
60:38 - you that's awesome
60:39 - that's really cool
60:42 - uh what am I doing okay so I need so I
60:45 - got the grip button let me add one
60:47 - What's called the stock button
60:50 - and the scope is actually going to be
60:52 - quite tricky so the scope button like
60:57 - this the stream of M1 to watch
60:58 - afterwards yep it won't be recording so
61:01 - yep afterwards it won't be available and
61:03 - of course what I'm doing here I'm
61:05 - basically making the system for a video
61:07 - so the phone uh tutorial or Showcase
61:10 - Video won't be coming out on Monday I
61:12 - hope Monday or Tuesday something like
61:14 - that so yep the the uh the live stream
61:18 - will be available and the
61:20 - phone video will also be available okay
61:22 - so modify the stock
61:24 - and then modify the scope
61:27 - okay that one is a bit too high looked
61:30 - it just a bit
61:32 - all right good uh okay so let's try
61:35 - adding all those parts and right now I
61:37 - know we need this testing code so I can
61:39 - get rid of this
61:40 - okay
61:42 - all right so that's good
61:44 - uh yeah set part and change
61:48 - change work I should do it change part
61:50 - instead but okay
61:52 - all right
61:54 - looks for the multiplier terminal is
61:56 - that how I find you oh nice that's
61:57 - awesome yeah multiplayer was a lot of
62:00 - fun searching for it so
62:02 - yeah that's that was it was really fun
62:05 - researching that because I hadn't done
62:06 - multiplayer in many many years so yeah
62:10 - that was great I'm glad you enjoyed that
62:12 - thank you uh okay let me go up here
62:16 - actually I don't need to modify anything
62:18 - here so in order to modify that one I
62:20 - just need one first of all I need the
62:22 - buttons so the stock and the scope
62:24 - buttons
62:26 - I need those
62:27 - [Music]
62:29 - actually that's a good question
62:32 - hmm
62:34 - once again the same question do I put
62:36 - them all together yes or no
62:39 - anyways for now let's make separate
62:41 - buttons and maybe I'll add it over here
62:43 - onto my thing but for now let's just
62:45 - make different buttons and then see what
62:48 - else happens
62:49 - okay so I got the stock button and I got
62:51 - the scope button and actually I'm going
62:52 - to modify that script but for now
62:57 - all right I just need to
62:59 - attach those so let me go into this guy
63:03 - on the part the touch Point let's put
63:06 - array size of three so I got the grip
63:08 - then I'm going to have the stock and I'm
63:10 - going to have the scope
63:12 - and for the attach points this is
63:13 - actually where it's going to be tricky
63:15 - so let me start from this one go inside
63:16 - this one make an empty game object name
63:19 - it the stock then drag it out and this
63:22 - way it has the exact same position okay
63:24 - let me put it inside the attached points
63:26 - and yep so that's the stock so I can
63:28 - actually take the stock and drag it
63:30 - inside there and disable it alright so
63:32 - that's the sound position
63:33 - uh the other one that I want is the
63:36 - scope
63:36 - naturally the Scopes are a little bit
63:39 - tricky where let's go there it is
63:41 - I don't know actually it's good I
63:42 - thought the Scopes would be with the
63:44 - pivot a bit different but no
63:46 - uh so let's go inside
63:49 - this is the scope attached point so
63:51 - let's go down here to the attach Point
63:52 - split the scope and drag the scope on
63:55 - there and disable it
63:57 - okay great as I'm adding more and more
63:59 - things this weapon is becoming more and
64:01 - more naked so that's funny anyways
64:04 - um yeah so I got the attached points so
64:06 - let's go into this one
64:08 - how do you make systems that work
64:10 - together well in unity I mean the answer
64:12 - is it depends on the quality of your
64:13 - code if your code is good well written
64:16 - nice and clean code then putting
64:17 - together system is actually super easy
64:19 - but if you write super dirty code you
64:22 - know just like I used to do 10 years ago
64:24 - yeah then Things become quite a bit more
64:26 - difficult so the answer to that is focus
64:29 - on writing good clean code and the
64:31 - better the code quality the easier it is
64:33 - to put together lots and lots of systems
64:37 - okay so I got the grip and now let me
64:41 - make
64:42 - a stock and actually I don't know how
64:44 - many stocks this includes so let me
64:47 - uh what do I want can I actually
64:50 - uh no I can't I thought I could do
64:53 - something but turns out I can't and tips
64:55 - on running cleaner code well I would say
64:57 - go watch my
64:58 - my complete course
65:01 - the going with this one was to focus on
65:03 - writing good clean code so if you go
65:06 - through there if you pay attention to
65:07 - all that by the end you won't have
65:09 - learned quite a lot so yeah learn a lot
65:11 - with your free course then you are
65:12 - that's awesome I'm glad it helped that
65:14 - was a ton of work but I'm really happy
65:16 - that the response to it has been so
65:18 - positive so nice thank you
65:20 - uh okay so let me get into the stock I
65:22 - need to pick up this guy
65:25 - can't I actually uh
65:28 - because dragging this is actually quite
65:31 - tricky
65:32 - so let me grab a different one okay so
65:35 - down here for the stock ah crap this one
65:39 - oh boy where was I where was I
65:43 - weapon a
65:46 - this one for the
65:48 - they're all these stocks can I unlock
65:51 - this one does that work oh it does work
65:53 - nice
65:54 - at least I think it works uh okay so
65:57 - where's the stock so let me grab just a
65:59 - handful of them so just stop
66:01 - one and two and then three
66:06 - just seven enough just to test it out so
66:08 - these top two
66:09 - and the stock three okay then I'm going
66:13 - to need a scope scope one so for this
66:16 - one let's call it a scope and let me
66:19 - find where's the scope and the scope is
66:21 - all the way over here so let's unlock
66:23 - and re-lock
66:24 - or
66:26 - is that it that is it lock it
66:29 - go down find the scope and let me grab
66:33 - which one is that one that one is a
66:35 - scope too okay let's go one two and
66:38 - three so let me grab don't scope two and
66:43 - that one is go three
66:46 - all right great so then on this one let
66:49 - me unlock it and just write the stocks
66:51 - and the Scopes drag them on there okay
66:53 - good
66:55 - so
66:57 - actually with this
66:59 - pretty much all of the codes should
67:01 - already be working just over here let me
67:04 - just refactor this so instead of making
67:06 - a function for each of them so change
67:08 - part
67:10 - and I'm going to receive a weapon part
67:13 - so that part type for the part type then
67:17 - I'm going to basically replace all of
67:19 - these references so down down and down
67:22 - okay
67:24 - so up here when I click on this one this
67:26 - one I want to modify the grip
67:28 - so let's go down the grip
67:31 - and on these other ones so on this one
67:33 - I'm going to modify the stock and on
67:34 - this one modify the scope
67:36 - okay and just like this I think
67:38 - everything should already be working so
67:40 - that one already has the
67:42 - attachments on the thing so let's see
67:48 - right and got an error what is the error
67:54 - uh did I not drag the buttons I didn't
67:57 - let me unlock this and there's the
68:00 - buttons okay so I need to add the stock
68:02 - button and the scope button
68:06 - okay
68:07 - ever considered making Unreal Engine 5
68:09 - content uh
68:11 - in an Ideal World sure
68:14 - but in the reality where I have limited
68:17 - free time yeah that one is
68:19 - basically I mean it takes a lot of a lot
68:21 - of time to become an expert at something
68:23 - so in order for me to be able to teach
68:25 - unreal 5 I would need to spend a lot of
68:28 - time actually learning it so yeah I'd
68:30 - love to to learn it just for fun but
68:33 - yeah I'm learning it to the point where
68:34 - I can actually
68:35 - teach yeah that is probably not going to
68:38 - happen since someone takes so much time
68:40 - and effort so yeah for learning
68:42 - ue5 probably better to look elsewhere
68:44 - and look at that it does work except for
68:46 - some reason one of the stocks is a
68:48 - magazine why I don't know apparently I
68:51 - tried the wrong reference
68:54 - that's a stock that's a stock yeah
68:55 - that's a MAG I have no idea why did I
68:58 - drag a MAG I don't know but yeah the
69:00 - stock03
69:02 - all right but yeah look at that it is
69:04 - working
69:05 - out bucket of games Thank you not much
69:07 - [ __ ] yeah that's awesome I mean thank
69:09 - you for the Super Chat thank you for
69:11 - being here watching the videos thank you
69:13 - for everything so yeah nice thank you
69:15 - okay and look at that so grips I can
69:17 - modify grip I can modify the scope and I
69:19 - can modify the stock and why is that one
69:22 - off this is kind of the the issue
69:24 - because I'm going to have to
69:27 - huh
69:28 - because the ah crap the same bug again
69:30 - all right I've only got to fix that bug
69:33 - yeah because every time I go it messes
69:35 - up but uh yeah so for this one mod Stock
69:38 - A
69:39 - yeah it is
69:41 - ah crap uh the weapon becoming
69:46 - um yeah
69:49 - but why is this one offset because some
69:52 - of the other ones they're all
69:54 - pretty good you know if I go inside this
69:57 - one yep the pivot is in there the pivot
69:59 - is in there and for this one for some
70:00 - reason the pivot is different and for
70:04 - this one it's also different yeah
70:05 - basically but that is easy to solve
70:07 - basically I'm going to need to make
70:10 - uh prefabs of my own Parts kind of so
70:14 - let me actually make for the prefabs and
70:17 - I'm just going to make a handful of them
70:19 - just right now
70:22 - um
70:24 - so
70:26 - let me just just fix that one just
70:28 - because that's a better night okay so
70:30 - what am I doing uh let me grab the so on
70:34 - the stock let me create an empty game
70:36 - object
70:37 - then go into the stock let me pick up
70:39 - stock three
70:40 - put it inside there and basically I need
70:43 - to offset it to where it makes sense
70:45 - okay that doesn't make sense
70:48 - so just gives pretty much the exact same
70:50 - name and let's make a prefab out of this
70:53 - one
70:54 - so if you ever have issues with uh
70:56 - modifying the pivot of some object this
70:59 - is how you do it you just make it a
71:00 - child of some other object
71:03 - and hopefully now it should be working
71:05 - all right
71:07 - uh okay so over here if I modify one two
71:11 - three there you go does work all right
71:13 - like that pretty cool
71:15 - just like this yeah it's already looking
71:17 - quite interesting
71:19 - it can modify the grip scope and all
71:21 - kinds of things all right so that's
71:23 - already pretty fun uh okay so the barrel
71:26 - and the underground those are actually
71:27 - going to be the trickiest things
71:30 - I wasn't expecting a buff dude that's
71:33 - funny all right thank you I guess uh
71:35 - yeah for me I love my two passions are
71:38 - programming and working out so yeah it's
71:43 - uh it's good because that's the only way
71:44 - that I can actually do what I do
71:46 - basically my biggest problem is when it
71:47 - comes to work life balancing that is
71:50 - always my tricky thing but the one thing
71:52 - that I never give up on is my time for
71:55 - going to gym and walking my dogs and
71:57 - that is really the one thing that helps
71:58 - me
71:59 - pretty much stay productive and helps me
72:02 - keep doing this for such a long time
72:03 - without burning out yeah it's the fact
72:04 - that I got those two things always okay
72:07 - all right so let's fix this annoying bug
72:10 - uh
72:12 - right
72:14 - theoretically can you make Unity just as
72:16 - good as unreal using egrp yep nowadays
72:19 - yeah pretty much I mean unreal probably
72:21 - still has a bit of an edge uh and the
72:24 - main thing they have is they have quick
72:26 - zone so they have all kinds of
72:28 - really photogrammetry assets so using
72:31 - good quality assets is
72:33 - quite a lot for making but Unity has the
72:35 - Adaptive probes volume
72:38 - and this one looks really awesome
72:41 - yeah right now it's only for herp but
72:44 - they are making it for urp soon
72:48 - so with this basically basically that's
72:50 - the issue is making something look good
72:52 - really comes to lighting quality and
72:55 - unity seems to be pushing more towards
72:57 - this direction so with that it should be
72:59 - very good so this is basically a way for
73:01 - adding uh probe volumes much easier it's
73:04 - currently on agrp and should be coming
73:06 - to Europe sometime in the future so yeah
73:08 - this is the one thing that I'm really
73:09 - looking forward to it being able to have
73:11 - screen space Global illumination just
73:13 - that one is great obviously raycasting
73:15 - is better but just that one is great so
73:16 - yeah definitely Unity is pushing towards
73:19 - having a bit more better Fidelity so
73:22 - that should be nice
73:24 - tips are good tutorials to learn Unity
73:26 - from your channel I mean if you're a
73:29 - beginner then go ahead watch my free
73:31 - course
73:32 - that one if you go through that one by
73:33 - the end you will have gained a ton of
73:35 - knowledge so yeah
73:37 - uh okay so what was I doing
73:40 - um
73:41 - right so the stock does work
73:43 - so the next thing is the barrel and that
73:45 - one is actually the one that is going to
73:46 - be really tricky because of the way that
73:49 - this weapon handles
73:52 - uh because the way that this system has
73:55 - because it's basically the barrel but I
73:56 - don't want to separate the barrel from
73:58 - the handguard sort of thing so I kind of
74:00 - want to put them together but the issue
74:02 - is that these have different shapes
74:03 - different sizes
74:05 - so that is going to be a bit tricky
74:08 - but let's put here the barrel what time
74:10 - is it
74:11 - oh damn it's already midday 20. yeah I
74:15 - guess it makes sense why my mouth is
74:16 - already quite dry because I'm really not
74:19 - made for for I was I doing as that yeah
74:22 - I always ask myself that uh yeah my
74:25 - mouth is definitely starting to be quite
74:26 - a bit dry anyways um okay so basically
74:29 - because I got the barrel and I want to
74:31 - include it with the hand card and the
74:33 - iron side
74:35 - so these are the three things that I
74:37 - want inside of the barrel
74:39 - and this is going to be the barrel touch
74:41 - point so basically I'm going to make
74:44 - uh right let me think
74:49 - because the issue is hey thank you so
74:52 - much for the super Channel thanks once
74:53 - again uh the issue is that over here
74:55 - this one actually includes multiple
74:57 - handguards on multiple sizes
75:02 - actually that's not an issue right now
75:03 - it's only an issue afterwards
75:07 - yeah so actually right now that might
75:09 - not be the problem
75:11 - unrecord yeah that is really awesome
75:13 - yeah yeah and recorded that one is
75:15 - definitely next level
75:17 - although the issue with that one the
75:19 - issue the uh why that one looks so good
75:21 - is not necessarily because of the
75:22 - essence even though obviously the s's
75:24 - are super high quality but it's more for
75:26 - the movement of the animation
75:28 - the way that the pistol is moving away
75:30 - from the from the face so the face is
75:32 - looking One Direction the pistol is
75:34 - looking another one that disconnect that
75:36 - is the one thing that really helps sell
75:37 - that one because that one really doesn't
75:39 - look insanely realistic and yeah it's
75:42 - because of using high quality assets
75:43 - with some that split in the animation so
75:46 - that is really interesting so but yeah
75:48 - that one is definitely a example of
75:51 - what's coming in the future as more and
75:52 - more devs have access to better and
75:55 - better tools yeah that is
75:58 - going to become much more common
76:01 - what kind dogs do you have uh
76:04 - they're a mixed breed so yeah no idea
76:06 - they're both medium size
76:09 - they're both sleeping they're both very
76:11 - very calm very chill so yeah they're
76:13 - nice uh okay so over here so I'm going
76:16 - to need
76:17 - basically a barrel and I'm going to
76:19 - basically have to
76:21 - build the barrels of different shapes
76:24 - hmm
76:26 - all right so this one's going to be a
76:28 - little bit tricky but let's see so I got
76:30 - a better one yeah I should have actually
76:32 - duplicated that one first so let me
76:34 - duplicate this one let me unpack this
76:37 - prefab what am I doing what am I doing
76:40 - where's the prefab prefab let me unpack
76:43 - this one and this one is going to be the
76:45 - barrel II
76:46 - and for the barrel two uh it's actually
76:49 - not the barrel
76:51 - ah crap I'm I'm thinking a bit too much
76:56 - uh make prefabs of barrels yeah but it's
77:00 - more that you know because I got like a
77:03 - tiny hand guard over here so I pretty
77:05 - much need to pick up that one
77:08 - and need to link up the barrel
77:11 - like this does it look
77:14 - okay I don't know and on such a small
77:17 - one do I also include the iron sight yes
77:19 - or no
77:20 - does that look
77:22 - actually I think that one looks good I
77:24 - think it looks better like that than oh
77:25 - crap than without the
77:27 - if I take away the iron side and put the
77:30 - barrel a bit more inside
77:32 - I don't know that also looks good I mean
77:35 - I guess maybe I could do barrels with
77:37 - and without iron sight you know maybe
77:38 - that could work anyways for now let's
77:41 - just include it and yeah
77:44 - it doesn't have some matches here but
77:46 - you could definitely do that I mean for
77:47 - this I'm focusing on maybe on something
77:50 - much more
77:51 - basic but yeah then afterwards you could
77:54 - all kinds of logic
77:56 - so yeah
78:01 - how to backup Unity projects the right
78:02 - way I mean for me usually I just do a
78:05 - super basic zip of the entire file
78:09 - but yeah that's not the the right way so
78:11 - if you want the right way I would say
78:15 - a Game Dev guide
78:18 - and where's the one where's the one he
78:22 - made a really nice video on how to use
78:23 - plastic SCM so this is unity's official
78:26 - version control tool so if that's the
78:29 - kind of thing that you're looking after
78:30 - definitely go ahead watch that video
78:32 - because yeah that is the built-in tool
78:34 - so that should be the one that is easy
78:35 - yeah the classic zip file because for me
78:37 - I may mostly do backups just for just
78:40 - for safekeeping pretty much
78:43 - so yeah for me super basic Zips work but
78:46 - yeah if you're working as a team then
78:48 - using Zips really isn't the best
78:49 - approach so yeah definitely go ahead and
78:51 - look into that one
78:53 - okay so Barrel two actually I'm going to
78:56 - name this brown one whether I call it
78:57 - brown two
78:59 - uh because this one is
79:03 - what is this one let me see it's based
79:05 - on the handguard so this one is the
79:07 - three so let's actually name this one
79:08 - the baron three
79:09 - oh crap so many clicks sorry trying to
79:12 - click underneath uh I think if UI tonkit
79:16 - is it production ready I did do quite a
79:19 - lot of research on it already uh I
79:22 - haven't made a video yet but I did do
79:23 - quite a lot of research and does seem
79:25 - that nowadays it is already
79:28 - pretty much ready although I don't think
79:31 - it is still I don't think it's runtime
79:33 - UI yet or am I wrong about that I don't
79:36 - know it's been a few months since I've
79:38 - seen it
79:40 - so is it now good for
79:42 - runtime UI
79:46 - uh but yeah basically the last time that
79:48 - I looked at it
79:51 - channel for 21 but on 121 I want to see
79:54 - for example version 22 do they recommend
79:56 - it okay so for the editor they recommend
79:58 - UI toolkit but for runtime they sound
80:00 - recommend the nty so yeah
80:03 - but yeah if you want to make editor
80:04 - Tunes I've looked into it and using UI
80:06 - tokit is so much easier than using I am
80:09 - going
80:09 - so if that's the kind of thing that you
80:11 - do definitely go and look into UI tokit
80:13 - that is definitely more than stable
80:15 - enough for that use case it just appears
80:17 - that for runtime it is not yet there so
80:19 - we shall see is there on version 23. now
80:23 - in 23 days I'll say the same thing but
80:24 - yeah definitely it's already advanced
80:26 - enough that you can actually start using
80:28 - it it's your first programming language
80:30 - I started
80:31 - doing IRC Scripts
80:34 - so
80:35 - I don't know what's the average age in
80:37 - chat but how many of you remember
80:39 - Merrick how many of you were on live
80:41 - back then
80:42 - yeah because that's pretty much how I
80:45 - started by making IRC Scripts
80:47 - so writing code to make this kind of
80:50 - thing I made all kinds of games kind of
80:52 - like hangman games trivia games so yeah
80:54 - that's pretty much how I started by
80:56 - learning how to do all kinds of those
80:58 - things it's kind of a scene-like
81:00 - language so yeah it was a it was
81:03 - definitely great to start like this I
81:04 - made my own thing on top so yeah it was
81:07 - pretty fun
81:11 - when born 91 someone remembers yeah it's
81:14 - definitely been quite a while but yeah
81:15 - this was a lot of fun really great yeah
81:20 - uh okay so let me continue making the
81:22 - barrels so I got the barrel two with
81:25 - that hand guard let me just move the
81:29 - uh what do I want just the hand guard
81:31 - too okay let me grab the Ironside and
81:33 - the barrel push it
81:35 - a little bit like that okay
81:37 - so then the barrel three is done and is
81:40 - there a four there no not this one the
81:43 - handle guard
81:44 - there's a yeah okay so there's a four so
81:46 - let me make the barrel
81:48 - four
81:51 - oh crap I can't see underneath the
81:53 - characters that that's the tricky part
81:55 - again let me just push it a bit just so
81:58 - I can work a little bit that's kind of
82:00 - the issue with the characters here um
82:03 - yeah so
82:04 - for the barrel let me grab the last one
82:06 - so the hand card 04
82:08 - get rid this one take these two and push
82:12 - them out like this maybe push it out a
82:15 - bit further yeah because this one is
82:17 - this kind of barrel is more from like a
82:19 - sniper rifle something like that so yeah
82:21 - all right
82:23 - okay so anyway so just making all the
82:25 - various barrels so this is Barrel four
82:28 - this one is Barrel two and this one is
82:30 - we're on one
82:33 - okay
82:35 - so now let me make these script mode
82:37 - objects
82:39 - so the barrel one two three and four
82:44 - so the three ah crap
82:47 - uh so for the barrel two this one is a
82:50 - barrel one modify all these
82:53 - put them all as a barrel
82:56 - for the barrel one the brown two the
82:59 - barrel three and the barrel four
83:03 - okay so then on the weapon attachment
83:05 - system let's add another entry on this
83:07 - nice structure and this one is going to
83:10 - be for the barrel and the attach point
83:12 - is this one so the barrel attach point
83:15 - and yep thanks to how the color the code
83:18 - is all set up this should be it so let's
83:20 - try it out
83:21 - and I just forgot the brown button so
83:23 - let me actually just fix that one
83:26 - so up here for the on click on the
83:28 - barrel I'm actually going to do pretty
83:30 - much this modify the barrel
83:34 - all right
83:37 - and she don't like a new Marine Co
83:39 - routines can you elaborate on that point
83:41 - basically it's because the pattern they
83:43 - force you to use so you need to have a
83:45 - mono Behavior object so you need to have
83:47 - a game object then you need to make a
83:49 - function that returns I enumerator
83:52 - uh micro routine then inside you need to
83:57 - do return Eon do all kinds of things or
83:59 - you don't return that's the thing so you
84:02 - need to do that then you need to call
84:03 - and start Co routine and do a my core
84:07 - routine something like that so basically
84:09 - that whole this whole entire project the
84:12 - song
84:13 - this one structure being forced to use
84:15 - the amount of behavior being forced to
84:16 - use a game object being forced to call
84:17 - starco routine being forced to make an
84:19 - eye numerator with the end return
84:21 - basically for me I find this entire
84:23 - pattern to be way too convoluted this is
84:25 - way too unnecessary so that's pretty
84:28 - much it for me I find it so much easier
84:30 - to just do a basic flow timer it's a lot
84:33 - more straightforward at least for me so
84:34 - that is pretty much why I do that you
84:37 - can use a Singleton class yeah sure you
84:38 - can do that you can definitely work
84:40 - around it but personally for me I find
84:42 - all those requirements to get that
84:44 - pattern going I find that to be way too
84:47 - way too cumbersome so yeah for me that
84:49 - is why I just prefer super simple full
84:51 - timers that is really basic really easy
84:53 - to understand so yeah but it is uh just
84:56 - personal preference
84:58 - so if you don't like cool routines then
84:59 - by all means go ahead and use them
85:01 - there's nothing inherently wrong with
85:03 - them it's just because I personally do
85:05 - not like the pattern but if you do then
85:07 - go ahead and use them
85:09 - okay why did I mess up over here did I
85:12 - not add them yeah I forgot to add them
85:13 - to the list so appear on the weapon
85:15 - partner list
85:16 - let me unlock it and add the four new
85:18 - barrels and that's all I need to do and
85:20 - everything else should be working
85:23 - do you have problems learning to code
85:25 - are you one of the genius people I'm
85:27 - definitely not one of the genius people
85:29 - I'm similarly someone who has been
85:31 - writing code for many many years that is
85:33 - running it so yeah I definitely have
85:35 - problems I mean you can go re-watch this
85:37 - live stream and see how many errors I've
85:38 - got once building this system the only
85:41 - difference is simply when I find an
85:42 - error I try to fix it so I'll learn how
85:44 - to do it I do a lot of traveling error a
85:46 - lot of things
85:47 - so yeah I'm definitely not a genius just
85:49 - someone who has spent many many hours
85:51 - doing this sort of thing
85:53 - all right so look at that this is
85:55 - already working quite well so I got the
85:57 - scope I got the stock I got the grip oh
85:59 - it looks really nice so I can make a
86:01 - really tiny weapon or make something
86:03 - like a
86:05 - really long rifle and so on all right
86:09 - so honestly the only thing that I'm
86:10 - missing I think it's just the end Barrel
86:13 - and afterwards everything is already
86:15 - working quite well all right
86:18 - it's the logic of a class loaded on the
86:19 - Heap and if you follow the item on the
86:22 - quest the logic itself multiple times in
86:23 - memory
86:26 - uh the Heap is for
86:30 - I always confuse the Heap in the stack
86:32 - but yeah
86:33 - let's see
86:36 - okay I always confuse those but yeah I
86:38 - don't know so basically
86:40 - when you load an object to class is a
86:42 - reference type so that one is
86:45 - yeah it's on the Heap I think yeah
86:46 - structs our Valley type so those are the
86:48 - ones that go on the stack uh but yeah
86:51 - the logic itself multiple times in
86:52 - memory uh no I don't think so
86:55 - don't logic itself
86:57 - that's a good question but no I don't
86:59 - think so it's only the data that gets
87:02 - store actually I'm not 100 sure about
87:05 - that
87:07 - but either way the code itself isn't too
87:09 - much so
87:14 - yeah total nothing load the function
87:15 - multiple times right yeah because that's
87:17 - uh yeah it just it you've got a
87:20 - different reference for each uh instance
87:23 - of the class so if you unload the CL if
87:24 - you instantiate a class 100 times you
87:26 - are going to have a hundred times 100
87:28 - references to that but yeah the code
87:30 - itself I don't think it's going to be
87:32 - repeated 100 times that would be very
87:34 - wasteful so yeah
87:36 - uh okay so what was I doing
87:40 - [Music]
87:40 - um
87:41 - all right let me do the Environ that is
87:44 - the one actually I made quite a bit of
87:46 - progress I didn't expect to be able to
87:47 - do all this in this live stream which
87:50 - has been going on for
87:52 - an hour and a half so
87:54 - all right so that's actually very good
87:56 - yeah I didn't expect to be doing all
87:58 - this so the end Barrel
88:01 - what do I call it what is a better name
88:02 - for this because I don't like the name
88:04 - and Barrel
88:07 - but
88:11 - yeah Barrel end and Barrel
88:14 - what do you call a tip
88:17 - ah I really don't like the name but
88:19 - anyways Veron and button and inside
88:25 - ah I really don't like the thing but
88:28 - Muslim all right that's good thank you
88:30 - yeah that definitely makes a lot more
88:32 - sense rather than barrel and thank you
88:36 - Muslim button
88:37 - is it an m416 the same thing is modular
88:40 - so you can make this pack is actually
88:42 - really nice I mean that's the reason why
88:43 - I'm doing this because this asset pack
88:45 - is going to be on a 70 discount on
88:48 - Monday next week so yeah they've got a
88:51 - bunch of presets over here so for
88:52 - example look at this one a really
88:54 - complex weapon
88:56 - then for this one some kind of heavy
88:59 - rifle
89:01 - and on this one
89:03 - this one is more of a regular looking
89:05 - rifle looks real nice nice red outside
89:07 - that's cool
89:09 - then there's also an SMG so basically
89:11 - all of these weapons are built using
89:12 - this modular system so with this you can
89:15 - see it looks really nice nice SMG then
89:19 - you got a giant sniper rifle some of
89:21 - these are based on the same thing so
89:23 - yeah
89:26 - so these look really nice yeah
89:28 - oh yeah this one can do pretty much
89:30 - without a a stock so that's fun that's
89:33 - done the intensity store it's the one on
89:35 - the where's my thing the cinti store
89:37 - it's a
89:39 - it's the military pack which is going to
89:41 - be
89:43 - it's going to be on the sale where's the
89:46 - other one
89:47 - the military yes this one which is going
89:51 - to be 70 off uh next week so that is why
89:54 - I'm doing this because say run a nice
89:56 - pack so if you need some things yeah
89:57 - thanks for always being so nice funny
89:59 - YouTube Ah that's awesome thank you for
90:01 - being here thanks for watching the
90:02 - videos thanks for commenting it's a
90:04 - two-way street so yeah thank you all so
90:06 - much
90:07 - okay
90:12 - are you just changing the gun objects on
90:14 - buttons click yeah that's pretty much it
90:15 - just having different objects and
90:17 - different objects that change in
90:18 - different ways and that is it okay so
90:21 - uh where was I the muzzle all right so
90:24 - let me actually rename that one because
90:25 - Muslim does make a lot more sense so
90:28 - thanks for that tip so instead of Barrel
90:29 - in
90:30 - Muslim
90:32 - okay
90:35 - more multiplayer netcut tutorials yeah I
90:37 - definitely want to do that I mean I'm
90:39 - currently working on my steam game which
90:41 - is based on multiplayer so yeah that is
90:43 - definitely a topic that I won't be
90:45 - covering quite a bit more in the future
90:47 - Okay so
90:50 - uh right yeah that's the issue with the
90:53 - with the muzzle it's the attach point
90:55 - for it yeah
90:58 - or hmm no yeah it is tricking
91:05 - yeah this one is quite a bit tricky why
91:08 - the script compilation take forever I
91:10 - mean that depends on
91:12 - what kind of things you have
91:15 - but you can definitely look into a
91:18 - simply definition
91:22 - oh crap assembly definition Unity yeah
91:26 - if you got problems with code
91:28 - compilation taking way too long
91:30 - definitely look into assembly
91:32 - definitions it's a bit tricky to set up
91:34 - also have a lecture on this in my
91:36 - ultimate TNT overview course so if you
91:38 - have that you can go watch that but yeah
91:40 - if you want to
91:42 - if you want to
91:43 - speed up compilation you can do this and
91:45 - basically with this if you modified just
91:47 - something inside the library then it
91:48 - only recompiles this one rather than
91:50 - wrinkle following everything so it can
91:53 - definitely help with with the
91:55 - compilation times for me usually that's
91:57 - not an issue because usually most
91:59 - projects on the list they are super long
92:00 - most projects compile in like two
92:02 - seconds so for me never really does that
92:05 - yeah strongly naming things too yeah
92:07 - picking good names is definitely one of
92:09 - the toughest parts so yeah definitely
92:11 - having
92:12 - help with that is always very useful
92:14 - okay so on the weapon attachment system
92:17 - let me add another part and for this
92:20 - other part this is going to be the
92:21 - muzzle and drag the Muslim reference all
92:23 - right
92:25 - so
92:27 - yeah for the buttons this one is
92:30 - actually pretty easy
92:32 - and I should probably refactor this code
92:34 - got to do it in a little bit rather than
92:36 - having so many individual reference or
92:38 - actually
92:40 - I could and I couldn't
92:42 - it works either way uh anyway so yeah do
92:46 - it in order to modify the muzzle so what
92:49 - did I do
92:50 - the muscle
92:53 - so that's all I need to do over there
92:54 - and really just building parts so
92:56 - thankfully this system is actually quite
92:58 - easy if you've ever done Android iOS
93:00 - games I've done some research on that
93:02 - area but no not really for me it's a I
93:05 - usually stick with just
93:07 - uh I usually stick with just PC games
93:10 - that's the thing that I've grown up on
93:13 - the thing that I've learned so yeah
93:14 - mostly do you know the Hot Wheel plugin
93:17 - yeah I do think that I've
93:19 - I'm pretty sure I didn't look at it in
93:21 - one of my assets list videos and I'm
93:22 - pretty sure nowadays it is actually free
93:27 - so I'm pretty sure it didn't be hot
93:29 - reload
93:32 - there's an asset that is now free is it
93:35 - this one
93:36 - okay I don't know but yeah
93:39 - yeah so apparently there's a yeah so
93:42 - I've seen it and it doesn't look very
93:43 - interesting so definitely something that
93:44 - I would like to research yeah look at
93:46 - that it's a ENT verified solution and it
93:49 - is free so yeah this is definitely one
93:51 - of the things that I wouldn't like to
93:52 - research as soon as I can find the time
93:53 - because yeah if you got problems with
93:54 - with doing it yeah you can you can
93:58 - definitely learn this how do you spin
93:59 - the pencil well basically many years ago
94:01 - I got into pen tricks even though I'm
94:04 - not very good as you can see
94:06 - ah
94:08 - yeah so
94:10 - I
94:12 - started learning from it quite a long
94:14 - time ago yeah if you go on pentrix
94:16 - tutorial
94:18 - as always nowadays you can really find
94:19 - so many things in so many places yeah
94:22 - look at that you can do the charger oh I
94:25 - could do that one but not anymore that
94:27 - also requires a specific thing yeah the
94:30 - the thumb around that's the basic one
94:32 - and the thing above I don't remember
94:35 - what that one was called yeah going up
94:38 - like that that's cool yeah that was fun
94:42 - definitely something that I I would like
94:44 - to get a little bit better anyways um
94:46 - yeah
94:48 - uh let me share this project GitHub link
94:51 - Yep this one I'm based on making this
94:53 - for a tutorial which should be out next
94:55 - week so yep
94:58 - uh okay so let me just continue doing
95:00 - this a little bit more what was I doing
95:02 - modified muzzle so basically I just need
95:05 - to make the prefabs
95:08 - so for the oh actually that's good
95:11 - because for the muzzle I also need to be
95:13 - able to enable
95:14 - no Muzzle so
95:16 - hmm
95:18 - okay so let me go inside make a prefab
95:20 - and for the muzzle yeah they got some
95:24 - Muslim breaks
95:25 - then there was a silencer wasn't it yep
95:29 - there's a silencer there's a bunch of
95:30 - silencers
95:33 - okay so let me put in there called
95:36 - muzzle one
95:38 - yeah the issue is going to be how to
95:40 - position it that's what's going to be
95:42 - really tricky
95:44 - well let's start with just Amazon one
95:47 - start with just one and then see if
95:49 - everything works so the muzzle one
95:52 - this one is going to be of type muzzle
95:54 - and this one is going to be a muzzle one
95:58 - all right so just with this I should be
96:00 - able to oh crap I can't see sorry
96:03 - uh let me see underneath just disable
96:06 - this one okay
96:11 - oh crap
96:16 - uh what did I forget of course I forgot
96:19 - the button always forgot the button
96:24 - uh
96:25 - okay so I can select the grip the stock
96:27 - the scope the barrel and the muzzle
96:30 - crashes why did you crash did I forget
96:32 - to drag the reference
96:34 - no I didn't so what happened oh right I
96:37 - forgot to drag it onto the parts list
96:40 - that's why
96:42 - yeah and for that one I need to I need
96:46 - to go into to be able to allow none yeah
96:49 - see this kind of problem so like this it
96:52 - does work but the problem is that the
96:53 - Muslim position that one has to be based
96:56 - on the barrel size otherwise it goes
96:57 - inside
96:58 - okay so let me think how am I going to
97:01 - do this
97:04 - because basically the muzzle requires an
97:06 - offset
97:11 - could I do maybe a barrel whistle
97:18 - I have a project where I only use an
97:20 - Arduino board in combination with DNT
97:22 - the game will be a multiplayer game oh
97:24 - that's nice
97:25 - it's stored data from the sensor in form
97:27 - of Time series for each player to
97:29 - analyze them later
97:30 - for a suitable database yeah I really
97:33 - don't know sorry that kind of very uh
97:38 - yeah I mean you need some database
97:39 - online and there are tons and tons of
97:42 - them but yeah I'm really not familiar
97:43 - with the pros and cons of all of them
97:46 - so yeah I know that Azure has a bunch of
97:50 - things so if you want to learn how to do
97:52 - that I did do some research I did cover
97:55 - some Azure tutorials so if you want to
97:57 - learn how to interact with Azure from
97:59 - Unity go ahead and watch those videos
98:03 - uh but yeah
98:07 - probably touching Muslim point to the
98:09 - barrel so uh not really because
98:12 - I don't want to put the attach Point as
98:14 - a challenge of a spawn object so that
98:16 - would be kind of dragging so basically I
98:17 - need the burnless so to contain like the
98:19 - offset for the Muslim position
98:21 - that's kind of what I need to do
98:24 - but the kitchen chaos multiplayer course
98:25 - will help me create the local
98:27 - multiplayer version
98:28 - that's not really the focus on the
98:30 - course but yeah sure I mean
98:33 - if you go through the course and then
98:34 - you learn about the input system
98:38 - which is used in the course if you do
98:40 - that then yeah it should be relatively
98:42 - easy to convert it to a local
98:43 - multiplayer yeah
98:47 - how do you instantiate that weapon with
98:48 - a specific attachments you choose for
98:50 - that I really just need to store the so
98:52 - basically over here the weapon it's all
98:55 - stored inside this dictionary right here
98:57 - it's got the part which inside has a
98:59 - weapon part so so I would basically just
99:01 - need to save that so I'm going to do
99:03 - that in a little bit but yeah it's
99:04 - pretty much I just say the weapon card
99:06 - so
99:08 - so
99:09 - let me just do the muzzle and then I'll
99:11 - do the saving and loading okay so for
99:13 - the muzzle
99:14 - all right I think the best thing of all
99:16 - is to make hmm
99:21 - I
99:22 - I wonder if this works so if I make what
99:25 - do I need I need the barrel weapon part
99:28 - so
99:33 - so if I make this one the barrel weapon
99:36 - part itself so this one is going to be a
99:38 - script long object
99:40 - and on this one
99:45 - basically I just need a
99:47 - public Vector 3 for the muzzle offset
99:52 - so I think like this or actually yeah it
99:55 - shouldn't be a vector three just a float
99:57 - muzzle offset
100:01 - okay so I think just like this
100:05 - now if I go up here and I make a barrel
100:08 - weapon part of so
100:10 - Barrel one yeah I just need a different
100:12 - name oh crap that's not no not
100:14 - scriptable object but needs to extend
100:17 - weapon part so you know this is what I
100:19 - want
100:21 - does this work
100:24 - oh maybe it does work all right okay so
100:26 - I think this might
100:29 - this might actually work
100:31 - hmm
100:35 - all right okay okay this might
100:38 - work uh
100:41 - with this Barrel Old
100:49 - okay so we got the barrel one
100:52 - and I'll just make two of them I'll
100:54 - correct this side so the barrel
100:56 - one and then I got a barrel
100:59 - two okay
101:01 - so now I just need to go inside the
101:03 - barrel with that one
101:05 - and basically for the Muslim position
101:10 - that's going to be pretty much just a
101:12 - point inside of it so it's going to be
101:13 - offset by let's say by this much so by
101:17 - Point 1432 so if I go into this one
101:20 - point 1432
101:22 - and then if instead of this one if I've
101:24 - got the barrel two
101:28 - so for the barrel two
101:30 - make a new game object for this one the
101:33 - offset is going to be
101:36 - something like this I think
101:39 - Sunday Brown 2 I have this offset so
101:41 - that way I have a bit more information
101:43 - when it's a barrel as opposed to
101:45 - something else
101:49 - okay
101:52 - uh
101:56 - send this so I change the parts
102:04 - yeah I think I think it is like this
102:07 - right
102:09 - so I changed the part I said the part
102:10 - transform okay great
102:16 - so if
102:18 - uh if this weapon part as so dot part
102:22 - type if it equals a barrel
102:27 - so if this one is a barrel then I'm
102:30 - going to go into this one weapon part
102:32 - dot muzzle
102:35 - so this is going to be the
102:37 - Muslim part attach points
102:43 - Muslim Parts attach points
102:45 - I'm going to go into this one and in the
102:48 - attachpoint transform Dot
102:51 - dot position equals and I'm going to put
102:54 - it
102:59 - this one dot attach Point transform dot
103:02 - position
103:03 - Plus
103:11 - amazing the position uh
103:16 - does right work okay now a bit I'm a bit
103:19 - confused right now but yeah so on this
103:21 - on the right times
103:23 - the all right I need to grab down uh so
103:27 - I need to get what I call it the barrel
103:29 - weapon part itself okay Barrel weapon
103:31 - part so equals this weapon part is so as
103:35 - bear on weapon part is so
103:41 - okay so let me get the attach point
103:44 - for the barrel just to make things a bit
103:46 - more clear
103:51 - okay so I get the barrel weapon carton
103:53 - that I'm going to position the muzzle
103:56 - on the barrel dot position
104:00 - was the right is that the right I don't
104:02 - know if it is the right but yeah that
104:04 - one dot muzzle offset
104:08 - okay I think like this it might be
104:11 - working
104:14 - so let's see all right
104:17 - forward from Turkey improving myself
104:18 - more and more everyday thanks to your
104:20 - videos oh that's awesome yeah I'm glad
104:22 - my videos have held you that's really
104:24 - cool best of luck in your Learning
104:25 - Journey nice
104:27 - uh
104:29 - uh oh I still haven't fixed that issue I
104:31 - thought I fixed it but yeah
104:33 - um
104:35 - if I put a bear on where are you moving
104:37 - put the bear on
104:39 - and got a
104:42 - known reference
104:46 - did I not telling muzzle
104:53 - uh on the Muslim
104:56 - I did add it
104:58 - alright bye thanks for being here thank
105:00 - you
105:01 - uh
105:03 - what exactly was not here this one is
105:05 - known
105:07 - no this one can't possibly be no
105:11 - this one is also not known
105:13 - is the barrel part does this one know
105:21 - how do I make good input prediction
105:23 - that's a very complex topic so not
105:26 - really something that can be answered
105:27 - right away that really depends on your
105:28 - on the context whatever you are trying
105:31 - to do so the barrel got no reference
105:35 - what
105:41 - is it the baron weapon partiso is this
105:44 - the one that is known
105:47 - do I need to cast it instead of doing as
105:52 - Maybe
105:54 - still get that special happy feeling
105:56 - when you get something to work probably
105:57 - yeah of course
105:58 - whenever something works it is always
106:00 - amazing like for example this there you
106:01 - go got a null error I think the biggest
106:03 - difference is as a beginner sometimes
106:06 - you get frustrated when you see an error
106:07 - whereas for me I know that's just part
106:09 - of the process so
106:11 - the fact that I'm seeing this error
106:12 - doesn't bother me it's just perfectly
106:15 - normal part of the process so in this
106:16 - case I'm pretty sure the issues that I
106:18 - can't
106:19 - I need to cast it instead of doing as
106:22 - checking if it's a bear not a muzzle
106:27 - which one did I grab
106:31 - yeah that makes
106:33 - oh no yeah no it it is the logic is
106:37 - correct it's just over here that I
106:39 - forgot to add it oh crap this kind of oh
106:42 - actually no yeah I forgot the unity has
106:44 - the thing for sorting the things all
106:46 - right so that's good so nine so I can
106:48 - get rid of the other elements so put it
106:49 - on 10 and then add the barrel one
106:51 - basically the issue was that I had
106:53 - forgotten to add the new script object
106:56 - type so like this it should be working
107:00 - so like this Barrel any up there you go
107:02 - got no errors and where is the muzzle
107:06 - uh right yeah this is the thing it's
107:09 - positioned on the right where it should
107:11 - be on the fourth Vector so four instead
107:13 - of right so up here
107:15 - for the forward instead of the right one
107:17 - all right
107:20 - what about the errors that is not about
107:21 - your code like when using an external
107:23 - plugin yeah that part is definitely a
107:24 - lot more frustrating
107:26 - but thankfully that doesn't usually
107:28 - happen so yeah did you fix the bug where
107:31 - the weapon flicked around nope not yet
107:33 - it is not yet fixed
107:35 - so here yep there you go the muzzle is
107:36 - in there yeah there you go that annoying
107:38 - I really gotta fix that because that's
107:40 - annoying uh yeah so got the barrel and
107:42 - got the other barrel and yep it did work
107:44 - all right look at that the barrel
107:46 - position is indeed changing so I can put
107:48 - a muzzle and there you go it does work
107:50 - all right awesome yeah there you go
107:54 - I mean snake and what the input to feel
107:56 - good well the first thing you need to do
107:58 - is actually Define what exactly do you
107:59 - mean by feeling good
108:02 - because that can mean a billion
108:03 - different things so yeah
108:05 - do you have a game development what
108:07 - would you tell yourself when you first
108:08 - started on this pad well what I would
108:10 - say is write a lot of code make a lot of
108:12 - games so pretty much what I ended up
108:13 - doing so yeah there's really no no
108:16 - shortcut to game development you really
108:19 - you just built something and you keep
108:20 - making things
108:22 - so I made a really nice video quite a
108:24 - long time ago on seven steps yeah that
108:27 - one which is basically just
108:30 - make a bunch of tiny games then make a
108:32 - bunch of small games then make a bunch
108:33 - of medium games and make a bunch of
108:35 - large games
108:36 - that's really it I mean experience
108:38 - really is one of the most important
108:39 - things
108:40 - so definitely spend a lot of time making
108:42 - a lot of games for me one of the things
108:44 - that helped me quite a lot was how I
108:45 - spent five years making Flash games and
108:48 - Flash Games by the by definition are
108:50 - only super tiny so
108:52 - in those five years I made about 40
108:54 - games and that gave me a ton of
108:56 - knowledge with regards to programming
108:58 - how to write code how to do game
109:00 - development with regards to game design
109:02 - trying all kinds of game genres so yeah
109:05 - basically made tons and tons of games
109:07 - and with experience Things become so
109:09 - much better
109:11 - how many finished projects did you have
109:12 - before publishing something
109:15 - because
109:16 - what does publishing something mean
109:17 - that's kind of the issue because uh
109:20 - in flash games yeah I published about 40
109:23 - of them and I probably had another I
109:25 - don't know at least 20 or 30 other
109:26 - unfinished prototypes
109:28 - but when it comes to Steam games I
109:30 - actually don't have too many because
109:32 - usually when I decide on a steam game
109:34 - idea when I actually decide on it and
109:37 - start really building something by then
109:38 - I'm pretty
109:39 - Focus that this is going to be my same
109:41 - thing so actually when it comes to
109:43 - steam game projects for that only I
109:46 - actually don't have too many unfinished
109:48 - prototypes
109:50 - uh right
109:54 - I'm a senior phone stack that with a
109:55 - good salary but I'm hating my job what
109:57 - can I do to change the game though uh
109:59 - yeah definitely start by watching the
110:01 - course and see if it is something you
110:03 - like but yeah I would say
110:06 - I would definitely say don't jump don't
110:08 - if you got a good job definitely don't
110:10 - quit it before you have a good
110:12 - alternative because making money with
110:14 - game development is really difficult
110:16 - so yeah I would say stick with your job
110:18 - even if you hate it that sucks but yeah
110:20 - that's
110:21 - stick with it and do Game Dev on the
110:23 - side and maybe when you get to the point
110:25 - where your side Game Dev when that one
110:28 - is actually providing income then maybe
110:30 - you can make the phone jump but yeah I
110:33 - would definitely say don't quit it until
110:35 - you do it because game development is
110:37 - really difficult yeah
110:40 - uh right did you enter the cinti jam uh
110:44 - no because I usually
110:45 - don't have time for game Jam so I
110:48 - normally don't do game jams but yeah
110:51 - that doesn't look really interesting so
110:52 - if you that if you have some time we'll
110:53 - definitely encourage you to do that I
110:55 - mean personally I love their style
110:56 - that's why I'm using
111:02 - oh
111:03 - can you still hear me did something go
111:05 - down
111:07 - I got a random notification from OBS
111:09 - saying reconnected so did this go down
111:13 - is it live I don't know
111:15 - I think so
111:19 - okay I think it's live again okay
111:21 - something went down all right okay good
111:24 - uh okay right
111:28 - so let me
111:30 - let me finally fix that bug that
111:32 - annoying bug about the rotation so
111:34 - basically let me do a debug.log on the
111:37 - mouse Delta
111:39 - and see which is the one causing
111:41 - problems
111:44 - because I think it's only on the
111:47 - rotate
111:48 - how do I get input a specific controller
111:51 - what do you mean by that I don't know
111:52 - what you mean but go and look into the
111:54 - input system
111:58 - the input system basically you can get
112:00 - all kinds of inputs so it depends on how
112:02 - you have it set up but yeah looking to
112:03 - use the new input system and doing that
112:06 - kind of thing should be relatively
112:07 - simple okay so I rotate all right and
112:10 - the issue is when I click away and then
112:12 - I click back
112:13 - yeah there you go the Y is on minus 600
112:16 - and I think that's the issue
112:18 - yeah if the Y is huge on the negative or
112:21 - negative or positive because if I go
112:23 - here then I click outside on the left
112:25 - side and yeah that one rotates but does
112:27 - not flip so the issue is with the
112:30 - with the Y
112:33 - so I can actually do most y equals
112:38 - math crack meth I always get wrong
112:41 - method.claim let's clamp the mouse down
112:45 - to dial y between I don't know minus 200
112:49 - and plus 200.
112:52 - don't fix it
113:01 - so if I go here I rotate I click away
113:04 - and I click back and there you go now
113:07 - it has been clamped so it no longer
113:09 - flips up down left right
113:11 - if I go yeah I should probably clamp the
113:13 - X as well just so it doesn't do that
113:15 - massive thing
113:17 - so
113:20 - any most Dante on the X
113:23 - also put it same thing
113:26 - so this fix huge jumps when
113:31 - when Unity loses Focus
113:38 - all right
113:40 - meth yeah meth is a tiny typical to
113:43 - right but yeah
113:45 - uh okay
113:47 - favorite hobbies
113:48 - I don't like walking my dogs I don't
113:51 - know if that counts as a hobby
113:53 - I love working out going to the gym oh
113:55 - crap I close it
113:57 - um so yeah I love walking around running
114:00 - oh man I messed up
114:02 - I put it on 16x9 and put it on the side
114:05 - there
114:07 - and maximize that's what I want all
114:09 - right great
114:10 - you say it's your own job I never had a
114:12 - regular job so I am not the right person
114:15 - to ask about that
114:17 - hey look at that this is the weapon all
114:20 - right
114:21 - okay let me just fix the other barrels
114:24 - and enable the ability
114:26 - to choose a no Muzzle
114:31 - uh so let me go
114:34 - let me call it muzzle zero
114:38 - and yeah for the muscle zero I'm just
114:41 - going to do wasn't like this except
114:43 - there's nothing inside of it that's a
114:45 - pretty basic
114:49 - so the muscle zero you got the Muslim
114:51 - zero and on the weapon part list let's
114:54 - set the muzzle zero okay so on the
114:57 - barrel let me make the other Barrel so
114:58 - there are three and the crap and the
115:02 - barrel four
115:04 - keys are just moving there yep I'm here
115:06 - I am Portuguese
115:08 - so I was born here in Oliveira it's okay
115:10 - to move the character in fixed update it
115:12 - depends on what you're doing if you are
115:14 - moving using physics then yep you should
115:16 - be doing it on fixed update but if you
115:18 - are moving by modifying the velocity
115:20 - which is what I usually do for that one
115:22 - you don't have to do it on the fixed
115:24 - update you can do it on update because
115:26 - modifying the velocity of the rigid body
115:28 - that doesn't actually
115:29 - modify the the uh doesn't actually move
115:33 - the object so for that one if you're
115:34 - just modifying the velocity you can do
115:36 - it on the regular update which is what I
115:38 - normally do so it's been a while since I
115:40 - made a regular character controller
115:43 - but
115:45 - yeah this one over here this one is
115:47 - still a nice tutorial
115:49 - so on there yeah I use physics in order
115:52 - to move it and yeah I do that
115:57 - Game Dev yep go ahead and watch the
116:00 - free 10 hour course so if you go through
116:03 - that course you won't learn quite a lot
116:04 - uh okay so what am I doing uh right the
116:08 - position on the barrel so let me put the
116:11 - barrel
116:12 - three
116:13 - reset and the barrel four
116:17 - crap
116:18 - uh let me find the positions for both
116:21 - these
116:23 - okay
116:24 - sure I mean I'm speaking English just
116:28 - because I assume most people
116:30 - uh in chat
116:32 - uh just no English not Portuguese but
116:35 - yeah sure I can yeah uh okay so let me
116:38 - put this put a empty game object push it
116:41 - to the side
116:42 - and for this one
116:45 - and pretty much like that so this is the
116:47 - offset so for the this one is what Baron
116:49 - 3 and put on this offset okay and then
116:53 - for the barrel four
116:55 - let me offset it by a little bit more so
116:58 - something like this
116:59 - on this offset like this
117:03 - okay good great
117:06 - so on this one if I add the barrel
117:09 - three
117:10 - and the barrel four and yep now it
117:12 - should be working
117:14 - okay great oh boy my voice is already
117:16 - very messed up
117:21 - you see about MVC patterns uh I've never
117:23 - used it uh I know that it's super
117:27 - used in things like web development and
117:30 - so on I haven't looked into it because
117:32 - of the when I was researching Azure a
117:34 - lot of those Azure things
117:36 - do you use that pattern so yep I'm aware
117:39 - of it but yeah I've never really used it
117:41 - and I don't think in game development it
117:43 - is used quite a lot but
117:45 - yeah if that is something that you're
117:46 - already familiar with it can be really
117:48 - great for
117:49 - I like how it forces you to separate so
117:52 - the logic from The View I almost forget
117:54 - which is which so the model that's like
117:56 - the structure then the view then things
117:59 - so yeah it does help with separating
118:01 - things out which can be quite useful so
118:04 - yeah
118:05 - uh all right so yeah so this is working
118:08 - I can put the muzzle barrels of
118:10 - different lengths and the muscle is
118:11 - positioning correctly then I got the
118:13 - stock the grip and all of these
118:15 - and there you go all right nice
118:18 - okay great all right
118:26 - get input from a specific controller
118:30 - player input and player input manager
118:32 - components you asked the the
118:36 - input system
118:39 - uh
118:41 - I remember it's you've got the control
118:43 - schemes
118:45 - or it's not the control scheme I don't
118:47 - know because on
118:51 - input system multiple characters there
118:55 - was yeah there you go cross-platform
118:57 - control so watch this video on unity's
119:00 - channel they've covered something like
119:02 - that where they got multiple characters
119:04 - all of them driven
119:06 - with the same thing so they use it in
119:08 - order to Define which characters they
119:10 - use
119:11 - so yeah they made a bunch of these
119:13 - videos so definitely look into that one
119:17 - uh okay so what am I doing all right let
119:19 - me just make a quick
119:21 - save load system
119:24 - so let's go up here and as usual make a
119:27 - private a class save object
119:33 - so I got the save object and
119:40 - am I just going to store all the parts
119:43 - that is always the thing that I always
119:45 - have trouble remembering which is
119:49 - does it automatically serialize yes or
119:51 - no
119:57 - said you were using a create function
119:59 - method
120:01 - what create function
120:07 - Singleton dead no that's a great very
120:09 - useful pattern personally I really like
120:11 - it so yeah
120:13 - Code Monkey Gym and Fitness video yeah
120:16 - maybe one day I'll do a second Channel
120:19 - yeah
120:22 - yeah lately for me it's a I go to gym do
120:25 - regular bodybuilding Fitness stuff then
120:28 - usually on the weekends I do a bit more
120:29 - running and lately I've been more into
120:31 - rock climbing so yeah do a lot of things
120:36 - yeah maybe one day I'll do a second
120:38 - Channel just focus on Fitness that would
120:39 - be funny
120:41 - where are you from I'm from Portugal uh
120:44 - all right so for the
120:46 - okay so for the same object I want yeah
120:49 - I think this is actually going to be
120:51 - weapon part is so weapon part as soon
120:54 - list and I think this actually does not
120:56 - work so
120:59 - so probably not public ah private Droid
121:02 - save
121:05 - and on Save let me go and you
121:09 - save object and inside the save object
121:11 - for the weapon partisan list I'm going
121:14 - to need a list of weapon particle weapon
121:17 - partiso list
121:19 - make a new list and basically I'm going
121:21 - to go do a four each on this guy
121:25 - ah crap
121:27 - trying to
121:28 - uh so for each
121:31 - on the parts type attach Point part type
121:34 - attach Mark crop
121:37 - I'm already starting to miss
121:41 - okay so go on to this one so if this one
121:44 - dot weapon part is so it is not known
121:46 - that means there's something on there so
121:48 - on the weapon partisan list let me do an
121:51 - ad and add this guy right here
121:57 - down this is the same object same object
122:00 - and then I take this save object and I
122:05 - do a Json utility to Json and convert
122:07 - this into Json so that's the string Json
122:10 - and let me do a debug.log in order to
122:13 - save this Json
122:15 - so this is the save and appear on the
122:18 - update let's do some testing so if input
122:21 - get key down on the T key
122:23 - when that happens let's try saving okay
122:35 - I have bad social anxiety when I lose
122:37 - control of volumes and stuff oh damn
122:39 - that's difficult yeah gem is dangerous
122:41 - yeah I mean yeah definitely start by
122:43 - working out at home that's definitely an
122:46 - option although I would definitely also
122:48 - encourage you to I don't know try to
122:51 - beat that essentially what I'm saying is
122:52 - a lot of people get really
122:54 - self-conscious about going to gym but
122:56 - personally I can tell you my point of
122:58 - view as someone who goes to gym five six
123:01 - times a week for me I don't really pay
123:03 - attention to anyone so if I see anyone
123:05 - who's a beginner who's something I'm
123:07 - really not paying attention I'm just
123:09 - focused on my own thing so that's
123:10 - usually something that people have a
123:12 - fear which is one of those sort of
123:15 - imaginary fears what I mean is the other
123:18 - people most of them are probably not
123:20 - judging you especially the ones who are
123:21 - who are there regularly they're just
123:23 - focused on their own thing so if that is
123:26 - your concern I would say
123:29 - I would say personally for me I I've
123:32 - never felt the desire to mock someone at
123:34 - the gym I mean we're all there to
123:36 - improve ourselves so yeah I would say
123:39 - basically if I saw you at the gym I
123:41 - would not have any negative opinions
123:42 - upon you so I would say
123:45 - focus on that and focus on the fact that
123:47 - the social anxiety that is probably all
123:49 - in your head and all the other people
123:51 - they're just focusing on their own thing
123:53 - so focus on your own I mean Fitness is
123:54 - all about self-improvement so
123:57 - so yeah do that but if you if you can do
124:00 - it at home then definitely do it I mean
124:01 - for me I prefer going to gym there's
124:03 - much more much more equipment much more
124:06 - things but yeah whatever you can do it
124:08 - always helps yeah
124:09 - yep we are all at the gym for the same
124:11 - reason so yeah and yeah cold sandwich
124:14 - yeah thank you for the Super Chat most
124:15 - important teacher of my life that is
124:17 - awesome yeah I'm glad the videos have
124:18 - helped you thank you so much all right
124:21 - uh okay what was I doing kind of forgot
124:24 - uh all right let me choose a bunch of
124:27 - things and press on T and nope it did
124:31 - not save of course this is always
124:33 - this issue that I was sort of concerned
124:36 - with yeah
124:38 - I'm already for two years nice yeah yeah
124:41 - it's a great experience yeah people are
124:43 - really nice yeah
124:44 - for the most part people will go there
124:46 - they're really especially people who are
124:48 - the regulars who know that the
124:50 - eventually things yeah really nice
124:52 - uh
124:55 - so for the weapon party yeah that's a
124:57 - problem because it does not
124:58 - automatically do
125:00 - so the weapons part is so yeah I gotta
125:03 - save it by name so I gotta do a string
125:05 - so I got a weapon partiso name so a list
125:08 - of
125:09 - string for the weapon part is so name
125:11 - list do a new list
125:14 - and then I'm going to do a four
125:17 - for each weapon so
125:20 - it's weapon particle weapon party so in
125:23 - the weapon part as so list
125:27 - so I go through that one and then I go
125:29 - on to this one and I add any word part
125:32 - so dot name
125:34 - so I add the name and then I save the
125:37 - name and now it should work
125:43 - oh another one nice hey thank you so
125:46 - much for the Super Chat Super Chat
125:47 - cuteness oh hey generally hey how's it
125:50 - going bye croissant yeah thank you nice
125:53 - yeah I hope you had a nice flight back I
125:55 - hope that was fun yeah hope you're doing
125:57 - well that's cool thank you
125:59 - uh right so press T anyway uh nope
126:05 - okay so now that's range that should
126:07 - have worked
126:10 - okay why did that not work
126:14 - wait is that one no it's not that one
126:20 - oh this one that counts
126:23 - am I not adding
126:36 - this one should be adding why are you
126:38 - not adding
126:47 - this video be on YouTube later yep this
126:49 - won't be recorded and of course the
126:51 - reason why I'm doing this is for a uh
126:54 - for a tutorial video which will be
126:55 - coming out sometime next week so yep
126:59 - that is the goal okay at things save and
127:02 - nope why are you invisible
127:05 - am I doing did I not save it
127:09 - oh never mind oh God ah
127:14 - sometimes I really mess up things yeah
127:17 - I'm going through the list but obviously
127:18 - the list doesn't have anything attached
127:20 - to it
127:21 - oh boy so that's not what I want so it's
127:23 - on this one dot keys
127:26 - is the key the weapon part type it is
127:28 - right
127:30 - or no
127:31 - is it no I don't remember
127:33 - and part-time part-time attached point
127:35 - so yeah
127:36 - oh boy so this is going to be the
127:39 - weaponpartiso that part type part type
127:43 - and then I go into so the
127:47 - part type attach point so part type
127:50 - attach point it is this one on this
127:53 - part's type
127:55 - so I get that one and then I do that and
127:57 - now it should work all right
128:04 - can I get a dedicated server for free uh
128:07 - not really I mean someone has to pay for
128:09 - it so if you want to use the lowest cost
128:11 - possible I would encourage you to use
128:13 - ENT relay because that one does have a
128:16 - very generous free tier but yeah getting
128:18 - a proper dedicated Center for free I
128:20 - mean someone has to pay for that so
128:22 - I don't think you're gonna find
128:23 - something for free all right awesome
128:25 - there you go it's saving that one
128:27 - sectionally maybe was it working
128:29 - previously
128:30 - hmm
128:33 - because it seems that it wasn't a weapon
128:36 - party so
128:37 - if I do the weapon partisan list and I
128:40 - put the weapon partisan list I don't
128:43 - think this won't work but still let's
128:45 - try it
128:46 - can run a micro ec2 an AWS free tier
128:50 - really
128:51 - forever or just say
128:53 - or just saying one-time thing
128:57 - because yeah I haven't actually looked
128:59 - into AWS when it comes to Cloud I've
129:01 - really unlocked at Azure and yeah I
129:03 - don't think they have anything that is
129:05 - 100 free on the time
129:07 - but yeah
129:10 - oh look at that so this actually might
129:13 - have worked okay all right
129:15 - so I thought it wasn't working but it
129:17 - really only wasn't working because of
129:19 - the
129:20 - because of the thing yeah just for a
129:23 - year per account oh okay so it's one of
129:24 - those promotional things
129:27 - 50 50 ccus isn't that much generous it
129:31 - really is I mean when it comes to Indie
129:33 - Games it is so difficult to
129:36 - to reach people to some copies so yeah
129:38 - 50 concurrent users that is a massive
129:40 - amount that is something like a thousand
129:42 - copies so if you sell a thousand copies
129:45 - on the first uh month of release then
129:48 - you can easily afford the cost that they
129:50 - charge for really so for me that one is
129:52 - either your game doesn't make it too
129:55 - well in which case you don't have to pay
129:57 - anything for the Relay or your game does
129:59 - very well and the cost of the relay is
130:01 - super mini skill so either way I think
130:03 - that one is an excellent thing
130:07 - okay right so I need to hey another
130:09 - Super Chat hey thanks again for sharing
130:11 - thanks so much
130:15 - nice like a gym all right thank you
130:18 - that's nice thank you all so much uh
130:21 - Muslim can be better without a barrel
130:22 - yeah I need to add some some uh some
130:26 - testing over that anyways
130:29 - um
130:31 - right so a private void load so unload
130:35 - I'm going to receive a string for the
130:36 - Json and I take Json and can I just
130:39 - convert directly I don't think so so the
130:42 - same object
130:44 - passing the Json
130:46 - and save object save object
130:50 - so I'm not sure if this is going to work
130:52 - but let's see let's do a debug.log on
130:55 - this one that weaponpartisan list dot
130:58 - count
130:59 - let's see if this one does find it
131:02 - and let's see if it does okay just need
131:05 - bit of testing so up here on the update
131:08 - let's go
131:10 - do another king
131:13 - on the y key let's go with and loads
131:17 - I speak it appears on my character's
131:19 - head yep yep it does
131:21 - oh got in there what did I do wrong
131:24 - they're not calling mode all right I
131:26 - gotta pass in the Json
131:28 - uh right let me just copy paste actually
131:31 - I've got the yeah I've got the Json
131:33 - right here
131:34 - so let me use a fixed Json for now
131:37 - string Json
131:39 - let me copy this guy can I copy it
131:41 - directly like this
131:43 - yeah there you go it does work
131:46 - I think this work oh right yeah I oh boy
131:48 - this is way too much text uh the Json
131:51 - ends here
131:54 - okay so let's see if this one does work
132:01 - I don't like channels Khan but we can
132:03 - look at light mode sorry but my issue is
132:05 - the opposite as I cannot look at dark
132:07 - mode so
132:08 - sorry I really wish that it was Dynamic
132:10 - I really wish I could look at light mode
132:13 - and you can look at dark mode but yeah
132:15 - videos aren't really Dynamic so it's uh
132:18 - difficult uh right so I did it so I
132:21 - press on Y and it did work wow okay nice
132:26 - I didn't expect to work that easily but
132:28 - yep it does work okay cool oh boy
132:31 - no my pen
132:37 - oh boy my my dogs are starting to wake
132:40 - up so I think it's gonna be about time
132:42 - let me just fix this
132:47 - challenge Japan
132:50 - uh right okay so
132:54 - yeah I just want to actually load it and
132:56 - it's actually going to be super easy
132:59 - right
133:00 - so I just gotta go for each weapon part
133:03 - so weapon part so in the weapon part is
133:07 - in the save object ah crap in the save
133:10 - object that weapon part as soon as
133:12 - second through that and call set part
133:14 - and set this weapon part so
133:17 - and yeah that should really be about it
133:20 - with that it should be saving
133:22 - automatically actually I don't need the
133:25 - yeah I don't need the name I just need
133:26 - the weapon part itself so I can actually
133:28 - get rid of this
133:29 - any Json probably still works
133:32 - so I don't need the name I don't need
133:35 - these things
133:37 - okay let's see
133:43 - do you have to master data structures
133:45 - and Algos for Game Dev
133:47 - uh now really I mean definitely helps to
133:50 - know but
133:52 - uh well with any other yield then loads
133:55 - I can put something completely different
133:58 - and then unload and there you go all
134:00 - right awesome great it works uh so yeah
134:03 - data structures now goes it does help to
134:05 - know them but yeah you don't need to I
134:07 - mean if you ask me to Define what is a
134:09 - bubble sort or quicksort or any of those
134:12 - things yeah I couldn't tell you I really
134:13 - don't know the I know how to store
134:15 - things but I don't know the name behind
134:17 - the algorithms but yeah so you don't
134:20 - need to know the technical things behind
134:22 - it but
134:25 - uh but yeah it does help to know how
134:27 - things work in general yeah
134:29 - General tips for using generics or
134:31 - interfaces
134:33 - I mean it depends on the context so
134:37 - yeah it really depends on the context so
134:39 - for example if you want to use
134:41 - if you want a good use cases well first
134:43 - of all I've got uh videos on those so on
134:46 - the generics and interfaces
134:49 - so if you want to unlock that for
134:51 - example when it comes to interfaces I've
134:52 - got the what did I call it
134:55 - interact with the record this one yeah
134:57 - how to talk to NPCs so if you want to
134:59 - see a very specific use of how interface
135:02 - can help you then this video is right so
135:04 - it teaches you how to use interface in
135:06 - order to be able to interact to talk
135:08 - with a person or push a button or open a
135:10 - door so interface are really good for
135:12 - that and all my videos on my grid system
135:15 - all of these are really based on using
135:17 - generics for the grid map so if you want
135:19 - a practical use case of generics
135:21 - definitely use that
135:23 - is playing their best for making your
135:25 - own assets uh it's one of the most
135:27 - widely used tools so yeah I do think
135:29 - blender is really great
135:30 - I've only learned the base of it but
135:32 - yeah as far as I know blender is a very
135:34 - good tool so definitely if you learn
135:35 - about it you won't be able to do tons of
135:38 - assets
135:39 - um
135:40 - all right so yeah so basically here the
135:43 - system is pretty much only working so I
135:46 - can modify all these
135:47 - let me just do a bunch more
135:50 - so just a few more minutes let me make a
135:52 - few more parts and then I gotta go
135:54 - because my voice is already
135:55 - pretty messed up
135:58 - uh let me do a bunch more muzzles that
136:01 - should be fun
136:02 - Muslim two and Muslim three
136:06 - uh because there are a bunch of Muslims
136:10 - over here I got a Muslim break
136:13 - these don't look really intense
136:16 - and
136:18 - another silencer
136:21 - so let me go over here on the muzzle so
136:24 - muscle one okay
136:25 - so on the Muslim 2 let's go with the
136:28 - last
136:29 - uh you know a sound turn
136:33 - and on the Muslim three
136:35 - let's go with one of these Muslim breaks
136:37 - let's go this one
136:39 - which is this one yeah that one looks
136:41 - good okay
136:42 - all right so down here I just need to
136:45 - add the muzzle two and the Muslim three
136:48 - just need them to listen don't need to
136:50 - touch the code at all
136:52 - once again thank you so much for
136:53 - description nice thank you
136:55 - uh Barrel scope grip Barrel Muslim one
137:00 - and there you go that one and a nice
137:02 - Muslim break all right that's cool so I
137:04 - can put a bunch of silencers I can put
137:05 - them nothing and so on and for the
137:08 - barrel it can be of any size so it can
137:10 - be really long it's like this and a real
137:13 - long stock there you go really long
137:14 - rifle that's nice
137:17 - not like that that looks pretty cool
137:19 - so yeah then I can press on T in order
137:21 - to save it and there you go let me just
137:23 - copy this yeah we just need to implement
137:25 - some saving onto a file instead of onto
137:28 - a fixed Json here but
137:31 - for now this works so let me just get
137:33 - rid and only find the Json
137:36 - there we go now I can get back to this
137:37 - rifle anytime I want
137:40 - so
137:45 - so let's try it out this game
137:48 - development need math I mean you need
137:49 - the basics but you don't need anything
137:51 - too special I mean over here on the
137:54 - making of this system I really only use
137:55 - math just over here for handling the
137:57 - rotation of the weapon so everything
138:00 - else really is just logic there's no no
138:02 - math involved in any of these so yeah
138:05 - you don't need to be a math expert
138:07 - you see the people at the bottom yep I
138:09 - do which makes it sometimes a bit
138:10 - different difficult to touch the button
138:12 - so unload and there you go here's my
138:14 - weapon and I can load something
138:16 - completely different
138:18 - then load again and there you go nice so
138:20 - I got some nice saving and loading look
138:22 - at that the camera
138:24 - the main camera where's my main camera
138:28 - for the near 0.01 there you go
138:31 - all right
138:34 - okay all right so I think that's gonna
138:37 - be it because my voice already messed up
138:38 - and I actually did manage to do quite a
138:40 - lot I didn't think that I'd be able to
138:42 - to build pretty much the entire system
138:44 - but turns out that it actually went
138:46 - quite well so I can modify all these and
138:48 - I can load them save them and so on just
138:50 - need to add all the parts for all the
138:52 - other remaining things but yeah in terms
138:54 - of logic all right I still need the
138:56 - under barrel and modify the mag and so
138:58 - on BM most of the core concept is all
139:01 - over here
139:02 - and it actually looks quite nice
139:05 - I'm quite pleased with this okay great
139:08 - all right okay so yeah definitely stay
139:11 - tuned for the video sometime next week
139:13 - and the video is going to coincide when
139:16 - this pack is on 70 off so definitely
139:18 - don't go ahead and pick it up right now
139:20 - wait for next week because those should
139:22 - be like this
139:24 - more likes to informal logic tasks yeah
139:26 - definitely whenever I got something that
139:29 - I need to do like this yep I will be
139:31 - doing this yeah we're applying to the
139:33 - channel yes this live stream won't be
139:34 - saved and then the final edited video
139:37 - won't come out next week all right okay
139:40 - so my voice is really already messed up
139:42 - so I think that's gonna be it
139:45 - so I'm working good so I'm looking good
139:47 - all right
139:49 - okay so let me just put on the
139:51 - characters just look at my OBS see how
139:54 - things are going like that
139:57 - all right okay great so yeah thank you
139:59 - all so much for being here I hope you
140:00 - found this entertaining useful
140:02 - informative whatever I definitely would
140:05 - like to do this more often so yeah
140:06 - whenever I get the next tutorial that I
140:09 - need to do some research I'll try to do
140:10 - it on a live stream okay so yeah once
140:13 - again thank you all so much for being
140:14 - here all right I hope you enjoy the rest
140:16 - of your Friday the rest of your weekend
140:17 - so enjoy it alright so thanks again for

Cleaned transcript:

foreign foreign foreign thank you all right hey everyone how's it going all right thanks for being here let me know if everything is correct it's been quite a while since I lasted on live stream so hopefully in terms of tech everything is working correctly all right all right so hey everyone hey thanks for being here on this random Friday all right hope you're having a nice day okay so basically I got a bit of work that I wanted to do so I figured I might as well do it on a live stream so let's do this I'm basically going to try to do a weapon attachment system uh let me just hide the background all right so basically got a weapon and I want to modify the attachment so modify the stock the barrel the scope and so on so should be a fun system okay so let me just look at my todo list everything seems fine and okay all right so I'm going to be film this out and feel free to ask any questions and I'll try them keep answering keep looking at chat and doing everything okay right so for the first task that I want I really want to just handle rotating the weapon so that should be a fun and easy one so let's start trying to make this a weapon attachment system start off by making a basic script s folder and inside let's do it same name and attach it all right stream quality is only 480 not 1080. is it is it for everyone because at least on my end it should be looking on the stream Health it says that it's healthy so okay so maybe there's a maybe just takes a while all right okay all right let's do this and yep all right I'm glad that it's looking good okay so first of all let me just make a void update and on update let me test input get mouse button uh no just Mouse button basically first of all I just want to rotate the weapon so let's see about local Singletons using SOS you mean like the the Ryan hippo script on object Tonk I think that one is interesting and definitely very very good when it comes to making a designer friendly workflow but personally for me I prefer using Code so for me I don't really use it but yeah if you do definitely go ahead and for those of you who don't know let me just put up the link it's actually a really great uh uh it was Ryan hippo I think that was his name let's pick the ball objects that was it the script ball object game architecture so if you don't know about it definitely go watch a tonk really great definitely a very interesting use case for more objects and how to design your games and on those kinds of things yeah this is going to be at least I think I put on the settings uh yeah it doesn't have DVR so yep this won't be record for afterwards all right okay so up here um trying to remember how do I get the the mouse position or the most danta I think that was it yeah I think that was it so private factor is this a two or three Z3 for the last Mile's position and Vector 340 miles donta take the last Mouse position minus down let's just do a debug download just see what this says just a tub the input system is easier yeah probably I mean for me when I when I make some quick prototypes I only start with the with the Legacy input system just because I'm so used to it so just so automatic but yeah definitely that one is quite a bit all right I'm not updating are you from Portugal yep yes I am uh right so over here I need to update so the unless Mouse position equals input dot Mass position all right spider on your back wow that's scary let's hope not uh right so as I move yep okay that is working moving on the X and on the set all right great so let me grab the weapon so is there always film transform for the weapon transform so starting this one and basically I want to modify the Euler angles and I need to think how do I modify it let me go back over here so on the weapon where do I got this weapon so for rotating do I want yeah probably want the local but yeah so I want to rotate so that's on the Y and then a little bit on the X all right okay so uh so for the so for the x is going to be the most Delta dot Y and most down to dot X and then zero so something like this but obviously but uh rotate speed let's put it something really small otherwise it's going to be pretty massive so let's see it's not the interior another planet what thoughts about the ntai I think they I think it is really interesting the things that I saw behind closed doors at GDC they don't look very very interesting they're definitely going about it the right way I would say so I'm definitely very excited to see how that comes the most important thing is really how they're focusing on on owning their entire data set so that way as a game developer you don't have to be worried about being um you don't have to worry about being sued over anything because of because they don't own the the underlying data set or something so the fact they're focusing on that is actually super useful so I do think that is going to be quite nice uh oh did I make the welcome or angles but why is it did I not do because it is rotating in a strange way okay that's on just focus on the on the Y first all right make a video on full body FPS controller I would encourage you to to use the the uh what's it called the start assets I would definitely advise you to use those I mean there's no point in reinvent the wheel or at least open those and see how they've implemented for example on the third person shooter controller for that one I pretty much refactor that third person controller in order to make my own and yeah so I would say definitely do that instead of trying to build it on your own that is probably the best way oh is this not okay that's on why is it oh right so I actually need to update it afterwards yeah right I'm not updating every framing I thought that was strange yeah there you go so yeah thank you God might yep that was exactly it was not updating on every frame so like this yep now it does rotate exactly isn't done uh all right okay good so basically just something like this obviously cannot go way into that one so let me just the background the other one is going to rotate a little bit but let's see over here so I need to push it a bit more like this and just make it a a bit bigger just so that the background isn't visible all right so let's just copy this transform copy the component and paste it like this okay great all right so with that yep there you go I can rotate it like that let me also apply the other one so over here the mouse Delta dot y except for that one I really want to limit it but let's see how much do I clamp it as far as it's an out of issue with the UI I click can click on anything what do you mean click on anything with a first person controller you're not supposed to be clicking on anything so I'm not sure what you're trying to do basically in first person shouldn't be oh hey and you remember hey thank you ladies thank you that's nice I forgot that this every time I do a live stream I forget that these problems exist um yeah so basically if you're using an FPS controller then you have at some point you have to unlock the mouse if you actually want to click some buttons so you have to go into cursor and you have to set the lock State and by default you're probably going to have it as locked which means you can't see the cursor so you can't click on anything so you need to revert this one back into none so that you can actually see the cursor in order to be able to click on menus so that's pretty much the only thing you should need to do as long as the cursor is unlocked it should be able to click on any buttons so yeah I would assume that's the only issue uh right okay so this one is good except I don't want the weapon to rotate way too much just a little bit so let's see what kind of rotation is this uh let me get into the weapon I'll write this oh it's when I click on elsewhere okay sure yeah that works okay so I only want to go minus 15 to plus eight yeah minus 10 to 0.8 so I don't want to go way too much so math dot twimp dot clamp going for the float rotation y Min uh what did I say minus seven minus seven X rotation y Max let's say on plus 10 so clamp the mouse down to y between the rotation y Min and the rotation y Max so that's going to be the point for the rotation y EP and then I apply the rotation line actually it's rotation X I don't know why I was calling it y uh yep so over here let me put this one always rename your variables if something changes definitely always remember to do that okay all right hey super Channel thank you thanks for featuring minus near 10 free assets oh that's awesome which one did you make nice all right I always go through it and always pick some interesting Essence and there's usually a lot of competition so if you made something and I sound like that means it was pretty good so all right congrats nice uh okay so this one it's a bit did I do LARP instead of no I did clamp oh right never mind yeah I'm doing it wrong I need to clamp the maximum not the thing that you actually modify so yeah it's actually I'm not going to go like this no actually take this I take the Oiler angles.x and I put it down and then do a new Vector three with this one then the weapon transform local dot y weapon transform local dot Z okay so basically on that one by the mouse down to dot why and okay I think that should be it all right how did you learn ninty by yourself making things on your own or from some YouTube channels well when I started learning that was in 2012 so back then there really weren't any uh YouTube channels so yeah I had to learn by myself pretty much that was it was tricky yeah lots of trial and error trying to search things look for csharp tutorials things on sack overflow and all those kinds of things so yeah it was definitely much stricter than it is nowadays nowadays you can just look at tons and tons of tutorials and you won't find tons of stuff but yeah back then I had to do it pretty much the hard way lots of trial and error reading documentation and so on so yeah definitely tricky definitely things are much easier nowadays okay why was this one not going at is this one is it the issue yeah I'm guessing this is going to be the issue with the yeah the alerts yeah they are they are manual So yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat and thank you so much new channel member that's nice uh right so basically my issue right now thinking of making a horror game but don't know how to model well that's where assets come in which is the same thing for me I also don't know how to model so the way I do it is I use lots and lots of assets thanks only nowadays using us this yeah that's going to be the tricky thing ah crap I hate this uh damn it uh yeah so nowadays I would definitely encourage you to use some assets actually that's part of the reason why why I'm doing this is because the the Cindy store they've got a sale and basically the pack that I'm using here for the weapon attachment system is the one that is going to be on yep it's this one the military pack which is going to be 70 off next Monday so thanks did I call it Cindy store second link I don't remember uh nope dot Co Yeah so basically yeah that's why I'm doing this in order to use some assets because yeah I also don't know how to model so for me yeah I need to use some Assets in order to be able to do some interesting things but thankfully nowadays you can find assets and all kinds of things so yeah definitely buy it and use it to turn your vision into reality okay so the issue over here is that as I go up as usual always problems with oil or angles so it goes up and it snaps all the way down so how do I do this well I need to basically uh increase it by 316 Maybe that works so if I go 316f minus n360f what's that with this it should be like that I hope except no except that one is going to be ah crap actually going to be quite annoying how do you keep focused to finish a game basically you focus on using a nice todo list so you always work from a plan so you define a plan to find the kinds of things that you want to do and you just do it day by day little by little every day that's pretty much it there's no secret answer you just have to try doing things do a tiny bit every single day and yeah just keep at it day over day that's the best thing that I can say is that the most important thing is really consistency so it doesn't matter if you work nonstop 12 hours a day that doesn't really matter what matters is working a tiny bit every single day for months on end that's pretty much it yep your game is the sum of 1 000 small success that is definitely a uh okay so this oh crap I always hate working with rotations and things always the issue uh okay so how do I fix this um okay let me think s uh local Oiler angles X equals this guy so I guess they can do if this one is bigger than is going to be 180. yeah I guess if it is bigger than 180 then I can do minus equals 360. and with that like this it should hopefully be working so now I no longer need this I don't think so basically if that one goes above 180 so if it goes in like 359 then it's going to subtract so it's going to go into negatives so hopefully this should work let's see well that's Chet CPT to get some rock out yeah actually that could possibly work but yep there you go finally figured it out so it's always the issues with going by 360 then it snaps back into zero and so on that is always super tricky but yeah thanks only does work so I can rotate One Direction another one only the axis is a bit on so I need to yeah rotate it on different but yep there you go that's exactly what I wanted so I want to be able to rotate the weapon maybe rotate it a little bit rotate a tiny bit up and down and just like that okay great let me just increase the rotation speed by a tiny bit just like this all right reassuring to see that even highly experience that I've done just code everything perfectly the first time yep that's exactly it I mean remember that when you see one of my videos what you see in the final video is the final thing after all the trial and error so yeah before I record the video I definitely go through this process I get a ton of issues in order to figure out what works and what doesn't so yeah just because you see the final video and everything goes well does not mean that I absolutely did it the first time no uh right okay so this part is working so that was just the basics just trying to make it rotate so that's fun okay so now let's actually do the proper attachment system so let me just see my notes because I was thinking about the design so basically I want some clickable buttons and I want them to be World buttons so that I can then I guess the thing is do I touch them inside or not that's a good question uh yeah I guess I could put them inside maybe try doing that so let's put inside put a canvas make it workspace maybe something like this so I'm going to have canvas and inside I'm going to have a UI button okay so let's put it really tiny and I'm going to want it to rotate to face the camera uh 0.5.1 you know that is way too big just get rid of the Sprite okay so basically I want a button that is going to be facing towards the camera so this is going to be the button for uh what am I going to count uh this is going to be for the barrel button okay something like this let's put it just a tiny bit okay and inside for the text let's say Baron put it in bold really tiny disable that and that where's the decks is it on the other side nope why did the font vanish that's all did I not importing text mesh Pro thing okay that's on so why the text mesh Pro not import the essentials that's range okay apparently oh never mind the window just showed up on my other screen that's why I didn't see it okay yeah that helps all right okay so let me select the font assets one of these two oh boy got some errors on the thing we create the game with JavaScript I mean this is Unity but yeah I guess in the past I have made some games using JavaScript that was uh actually I was trying mostly it was with PHP back when I wanted to make a a online game kind of like dark galaxy I really enjoyed playing that one that was really fun really interesting so so yeah I've definitely tried that record mug it sounds different well that's probably because I'm in I'm doing live streams so I'm not my voice is definitely different why is this guy not showing did I yeah bro yeah it messed up the Sprite asset okay so let me try doing oh crap I can't click under the people so let me just get read make new button Barrel button yeah the issue with the text mesh girl not showing up all right why have you been a Game Dev I've been using Unity since 2012. and I've been programming since I was about 10 so definitely been doing this for quite a long time uh right let me just grab the button actually ah crap sorry I can't read the messages right now I'm trying to yeah because the yeah because I should not rotate this guy I know instead just rotate the barrel thing and just need to make it a lot smaller than this and on the barrel button okay make it quite a bit more like this point two something like this all right okay finally ah crap I offset it no put it down there this one okay all right so that was quite a bit tricky actually because of the thing all right okay hey thank you for the Super Chat tunneler I was wondering if you have are planning to make an updated yinty analytics video yeah yeah there is a I did Cover analytics and there's a lecture there but yeah that lecture was quite a while ago and in the past few months they completely refactored it so yeah I definitely need to do that one right now because I haven't yet looked into how the new analytics Works what exactly changed I assume quite a lot of things change so yeah I'll definitely so yeah that's definitely part of the plan just don't know when I'll be able to do it that's always the it's always a tricky thing especially with that course which is should I spend my limited time on updating own lectures or covering new tools that is always the tricky question that always have trouble answering so yeah definitely part of the plan since that one is pretty much outdated so yeah that lecture hopefully soon I'll be able to update at least just down uh okay so look at the camera let me just make this one super simple one late update and over here let's see the trends form dot forward and I never remember if it's before it or not forward camera dot main transform.4 I'm pretty sure it's reversed I'm pretty sure that's how it's supposed to be okay it's gonna be an escape from tarkov yeah pretty much that is the one that I used as reference in order to figure out which one I should do so yep that's definitely the kind of thing that I'm going for all right did the kitchen chaos course and want to know if I can turn it into a coop game yes when the the second part of that game second part of that course is on taking that game and converting into multiplayer so yes if you haven't done it yet definitely go ahead and follow the the free multiplier section so follow that one and if you can make it into a coop game all right okay so basically yep it is working except apparently I did want the opposite so now reverse but just facing like that and this one also needs to be quite a bit smaller so let's put it maybe on point 3.1 we're going to have to modify all of this okay Barrel quite a bit tiny that's the issue with these it's kind of hard to crawl in order to be able to find but anyways sure okay so that works all right okay so thanks so much summer for the Super Chat yeah thank you all right so basically I got my canvas and I want and I want to be able to click on this button so let me go into the definitely going to need to refactor quite a lot of this I gotta say that writing code once on live stream it's quite a bit trickier my brain definitely works much much slower it's definitely much trickier to do things so yeah doing it on the live stream complicates things can I use your Utilities in the game I want to sound same yep feel free to use the utilities in your own games free or commercial yep go ahead I hope they help you in your game okay so the barrel button let me just actually I just want to test if I can actually click on the button yes or no so on the barrel button on click add in listener and over you just debug.log in order to bear on them all right how do you handle dealing with encountering games that are similar to the one you are working on uh the answer is don't worry about it pretty much I mean you can have two people that come up with the exact same uh design and even if you do two people that come up with the same design over the building of the game The Funnel games will be completely different so yeah I would say definitely don't worry about it unless you're actively trying to make a clone it it won't come out exactly the same thing so definitely don't worry about that if someone has a similar idea go ahead make your own whatever you do it is going to end up being quite different so yeah don't worry about that all right okay so the button does work I can select the barrel yeah that's one all right okay so let me uh okay so I got the basics I can rotate I can do a thing and now the main thing that I want is the parts okay so let's start by making the weapon part so can you see Sharp script weapon part so let's go inside and this one is going to be a script mode object with a create asset menu and okay so for this one let me see what do I need for it right I'm going to need a poem for the part type this is where I'm going to uh the final things okay so let's see I'm going to have a barrel then a barrel end then an under Barrel a stock a grip and a magazine something like that okay and for the parts I'm going to make it a problem with part type and the part type and then I guess if only transformed for the prefab that I'm going to instantiate okay I used to like the White theme because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it if I put this on dark mode I couldn't stare it for more than three seconds so sorry but yep for me it has to be like that objects okay and inside let's make a weapon part so let's make it a barrel and actually let's start with the grip because that one is probably going to be easier so start with the grip and let's see all the parts that I got so we're here seeing all the assets You Can't customize the snow let's go oh yeah yeah I forgot about it but yeah definitely going to be able to customize the scope as well yep uh okay so for the grip that one should be the easiest one so this one has three separate grips okay so let's start by doing that what are the names grip one two three that's it yep okay so on this one let's call this script one grip two and grip three okay now the tricky thing about this kind of system is going to be how do I position them yeah because basically so the way these assets are set up so the body is like that but I actually want the body to be a bit more offset because right now the rotation is a bit strange so let me grab all of these and try to move them just a little bit just because yeah the body's supposed to be kind of like that okay good let me actually move it kind of like this all right uh okay so for the body nice and missions to show the chat messages yeah nice if you want to know I actually covered it on the oh God I always forget the yeah I actually didn't notice the message down here because there is you can customize your character on your live stream except I don't remember the oh God I always forget this one so customize live stream character yeah I don't think that's it I'm not gonna remember oh crap it shows up down here the link to customize it I always forget this this is always a thing that I forget but yeah basically you can customize your character and in there it also showcased all the all the things that you oh crap why can't I remember it I always forget that one I always forget what it's called uh nope damn it so I can figure out okay So eventually it's going to pop up the message down here so when it does let's see uh anyways Okay so I want to modify start off by modifying that one so uh okay yeah basically I'm trying to think of how am I going to policy points so this is going to be what am I calling it the grip so these are going to be the attach points so let's put inside attach points put down on zero and then put the grip is the grip on the position yep and basically essentially where's the grip let me grab a grip this one is the mod a mod a grab a grip put it in there yeah I think that's supposed to be the position and just get rid of the grip on this one and yep that does work okay right so on these Ripple objects let me assign the prefabs and actually for the prefabs I'm going to one no I can use like this one right now okay so let's put grip one then the grip two and finally the grip three oh grip three all right okay so for the weapon itself let me link up on the weapon attachment system let me put another transform for this one is going to be the grip attach point great Eternal thanks oh that's awesome I'm quite the videos have helped you okay so for the grip touch points okay and the way that I'm going to oh yeah player customization tutorial yeah I think that's is that the link does it work nope it's something like that but yeah I can't remember exactly what it is or maybe nope nope or yes all right it is all right yeah thank you for your home who was it weird sweaty yeah thanks for the help yeah it's uh yeah that is the one I always forget that that link I really need to add some clickable link somewhere so anyways yeah you can customize your character and yeah at the bottom down here if you want to know how I made this yeah basically this is a transparent TNT window then for the characters they are controlled using some mesh based animations and the way that this is interacting with the YouTube API is through an HTTP request from inside unity and if you want to see more on how I color the colored all of these random uh characters those are pretty much the same code that I used in my game battle round Tycoon so you can see you can watch all these tutorials and figure out how all this works and maybe make your own if you also do some live streams or want to do something fun yeah this should help okay right uh okay so over here how do I just think you have a private a dictionary a dictionary of weaponpart as so dot part type and then the transform so for the weapon part type transform dictionary okay do a new one and up here let's see a red void set parts and what part am I going to put so not part time so the part type and wait do I do part type or no yeah because the thing already has the parts so if I just put a weapon for this so if I just do this one then I can go into the dictionary on this weapon part so that part type and basically I'm going to instantiate so transform for the part transform and I'm going to instantiate go into the weapon part instantiate the prefab okay all right so the weapon part type is this one but I also need to do some cleanup so if this one dot contains this key if it does already contain ducky then I need to destroy that one so I need to destroy this one dot game object okay so I destroyed that one I spawn the new one I put it and then I just need to actually position it so over here let's make a struct what am I going to call it part type attach point and I'm going to power the public weapon part so that part type for the part type and then a public transform for the attach Point transform and I gotta make this a serializer bone in order to show up and up here make a serialized field what's your own serialized film of parttime attach Point Let's see analyst of this one cell part type attach Point list okay so this way I can have the list and then over there I can or not for each uh first of all let me just fill out the array okay all right hello from Sweden hey nice what time is it in Sweden what is it like what is one plus two so it should be around what 2PM over there so that's nice uh okay so we're here for the part attach Point let me add one and I'm going to put it for the grip and for the group attached point it is this one right here okay that's a good question do I put it as a child or not I'm not sure 12 47 oh so it's really just one hour really huh I thought it was a bit more since Sweden is quite a bit more to write where I'm in yes 18 okay interesting all right so uh let me also make yeah a dictionary of the trying to think uh weapon tart attach Point transform dictionary and over here let me make a new one and then do a four each a four each on this guy right here for the part type attach point and the part type attached pointless then I go into this guy and I access it on the parttime touchpoint.part type and I put it equals to the parttime attach Point dot the transform okay so that way I assign the transform and then down here I can do a transform for the attach Point transform and on this one basically I can grab the transform for the part type and the part type is going to be this webinesso.par type so with that one I have that one and over here dot parent I can put it as a channel that down and then put that local or angles equals Vector 3.0 and same thing for the oil composition also Vector 3.0 all right brings from peterborg all right nice uh okay so for testing let me make a simple weapon part so weapon part so and let's go one and two just for testing so I get two of them and then over here on update lets you so if input get key down and let's go with the T king so I'm taking step apart and going the weapon part so one and on the Y let's go with set part SO2 all right so let's see that how can I learn to code in a good way well watch tutorials and more importantly actually do the things that's pretty much it don't just blindly copy paste code actually try to try to follow things try to do things so I want you to turn on then try to make it on your own modify the code see what changes and yeah that's pretty much it there's really no secret for how do you learn how to code how do you learn how to make games it really is you just try to do it and then keep on doing it okay I think I forgot one thing did I yeah I did sort of forget one I just forgot to uh where's the what am I clicking on oh is that one spawning two of them yeah because there's the default one over the Oh okay that's unintentional why did that one huh because whenever I click outside and then click back it sometimes does something oh look at that wow that's on huh it kind of like why there's reverse why did that one go into 180 all right that's strange yeah it only basically this is one of those weird bugs that only happens in the editor basically if this was a build actually if it was a building it would still possibly work because you could always click away but yeah basically the issue is with the delta so if I click outside and then click there that's funny all right that's not supposed to happen but sure uh actually I can sort of fix that can by making the I could clamp the mouse don't they except which one is I don't know anyways I'll I'll fix that later right now I really want to make sure that this part at least is working and yep it is working so I can swap out I can click a button and yep it does sup up down let's just make the third one just for fun so I got that one right now just based on key input but yep that's about it so the one thing that I do need is to get rid of the one that is on here right away so this one just disabled it so right now there's no grip then I click I said I don't like Co routines you use async methods and test instead no but that is also a valid option for me usually I just use basic uh flow timers so just count on the time I've got a class that is super useful in my utilities that I use it all the time and I made a video about it a long time ago so the function timer Yeah so basically this is the whenever I want to do some time based logic I just use a basic fold timer but yep if you do like using async and a weight then you have definitely go ahead and do that because that is pretty easy but application is focus work to fix that uh not really because the issue isn't that it loses Focus the issue is that it keeps track of the last uh the last position so over here the last Mouse position so this one grabs the input that Mouse position and when it loses Focus this one stops updating I don't know I think this one returns zero So based on the issues go go out of focus and you go back into focus and the input Mouse position difference between that one and the last one is going to be huge and for some reason that is causing that one to flip 180 so that's a bit strange so yeah basically the solution would be just make sure to limit the mouse Delta just limit it to a certain amount and that way it wouldn't cause issues on moving normally and when snapping from a huge distance it would clamp so it wouldn't cause problems so basically that would be the fix but yeah right now I really want to just make sure this part is working and obviously I forgot one thing but yep so on the weapon system you gotta put the grip three yep all right so the basics is kind of working there you go look at that all of them swapping nice can I use 22 or wait for LTS yep I would say definitely use 22 nowadays it's the version that I'm always using so yep the LTS should be coming out where are we we're at the end of April right yeah usually the LTS version comes around apron so yeah I guess the LTS version should be right around the corner pretty much uh okay so instead of being on things let's put it based on a button so on this one that's kind of tricky thing I'm going to have to make could I use just one canvas that's a good question I actually don't know would that work because multiple canvas is going to be make it quite a bit tricky so for this one let's call the grip button and instead of putting the look at let me see because I actually don't know if this is going to work or not let's try putting a look at camera on these two instead of on the canvas and that way I can have just one canvas let's see if it works I have like that actually does work all right nice so that's exactly what I want okay so on this one down here it is not the barrel but we're at the grip and when I click on it I want to modify it so up here let me grab the button I'm probably going to eventually refactor this code separate the UI from the actual weapon logic but yep you are the champ you got me into Game Dev let's start off with program now working on Local web dev as a frontend view.js all right awesome hey that's really awesome it's really great how programming is really such a global thing so yeah you can start from one area and end up in something completely different so yeah that's awesome yeah I hope you're enjoying your job that's a great story nice yeah JavaScript is one of those things that I if I had the time I would love to be able to explore it I pretty much just know the basics I know there are so many tons and tons of JavaScript Frameworks and yeah I will definitely that is one area that I would love to research if I can find time but yeah I can wear ads on getting into programming getting a job that's really awesome nice all right okay so I've got the brick button and okay let me just make this one so grip button on click at The Listener and for this one let me make a function so probably change grip and on this one up here let's go put that one on the change the grip okay so on this one I want to modify the grip and how do I oh that's actually yeah I'm gonna need hmm yeah actually a different uh dictionary stone is the attach point that one is the spawn thing hmm I'm trying to think do I make different structs or do I put them all on the same one it's actually a good question I'm actually not entirely sure all right let's put it here and then if needed I can just refactor it okay so the spawn transform and inside I'm also going to have the weapon part to so weapon part is so okay so those are supposed to start off as empty and on this dictionary I'm actually going to make it a dictionary of the attach point but then actually hmm not yet because I got the attach point and I got the things okay so let me just refactor this because yeah I think that I probably only needs that one right so instead of getting that one put down on this guy right here okay and then get rid of this second dictionary and now down here I go into this guy if this guy contains that part and this guy oh crap and this one dot the spawn transform is not known if it is not known then that's what I want to destroy I want to destroy the spawn transform okay and then you go into the part transform you spawn a brand new one all right then you go inside this dictionary on that one and on the spawn transform you put it as down can I modify the return value oh crap I only saved this it's always annoying uh so what do you call this thing or type attach Point whatever touch Point equals this guy right here and then the part type attach Point that's one transform equals down I guess you should probably make that one a class instead of a struct that would probably solve this problem anyways fine and the attachment point transform it is going to be this one dot the attach Point transform I put down on that one and then I just need to make sure to update this one yeah I think I should probably just make that one a class so that I don't need to worry about copies and so on but anyways okay so it isn't like this now I've got a structure that has all the data that I want so with this basic refactor hopefully everything should still be working the same so let's see after a night shift Shawarma IPA programming stream oh that's nice that's a very busy day huh uh right for example it's not yeah I forgot to assign the grip button that's not the one that's the one the grip button all right okay just wondering why did you choose struct over class just because usually when it's for groups of data that are only supposed to hold down for that one usually I just go with uh for that usually I go with struck just because just honestly they're usually in most cases there's there's no reason you can use another one so yeah it's really just habit whenever I just want to start some data I just tend to go without anyway so this is now working so that's fun and I just need to put on this one so I spawn it I position it and then on this one for the weapon partner so equals this one so this way I know what weapon is attached to that one okay so now when I change the grip uh I guess things I'm going to need an Esso for all of the enlists hello there hey both of you nice thanks for being here what's your real name my real name is Hugo how you doing yeah I'm doing great yeah thank you all for being here on this random live stream on this random Friday morning thanks for being here uh okay I'll make a weapon part list as so and for this one I'm going to want to make a scriptable object with a create asset menu and now inside of it I'm going to want to on the enlist the weapon parts so weapon part SL list and then basically I want a public list of weapon part so yeah this one could probably be yeah it could be fixed but I think making it Dynamic makes a bit more sense so get weapon part as soon list and I'm going to take a printer of type part type like this so list of weapon parts so weapon part so list actually instead of giving it the same name because everything can be a bit confusing so return weapon part as some list and eventually I'm going to return this one and I'm going to do a for each on weapon part so weapon part is so in the weapon partisan list and if this weapon part is so not part type if it matches the one that I'm looking for then on the return weapon partisan list let's add this one and return it okay so this way I've got a nice function to return it which is going to describing objects and let me make the weapon part so list or list this so I guess so on this one and let's select this one and add the three grips okay great so now if I go on to the other one ever facing lots of data when using public properties within scriptable objects uh no but then I never use property so maybe that's why really do you lose that that's a bit interesting yeah with assembly definitions okay yeah I don't know because for me when it comes to scribble objects I'll use them as readonly uh data containers so for me I always make them as public variables yeah over here I never use any any property so I never had that issue that is definitely very strange can I recommend the fix for a third person shooter animation rigging close to one problem well the solution is use a separate camera so kind of like how I did on the on the recent on the drag racing mini game versus why is this so smart uh no problem I'm gonna have to yeah ah crap so over here how I made the there's a camera for the actual game scene and then there's a separate camera for the UI so in order to prevent a shooter I'm actually only now I know you said third person shooter yeah basically I was talking about in first person so in first person you use a camera just to run the weapon and the camera to run the thing in front and then you just stack the weapon and that way the weapon will never clip through the geometry in third person shooter yeah for that one you were only just uh do a raycast in order to find the distance to the wall and if the wall is way too close and you basically just use another animation where the character kind of lifts up the weapon that's pretty much it so for that one it would just be based on animation rather than anything more complex okay right so what was I doing I was trying to modify that one so let me go into the weapon attachment system and when I click on that one let me just grab a reference to the weapon what did I call it the weapon partner SSO so the weapon part is so and on this one basically when I click in order to modify the grip so first I need to know what grip am I using so for that let's go into this one on that part type can I assume that this one actually exists yeah I think I can make that assumption because this transform dictionary yeah I'm always going to need to add the attach point so I can actually make the assumption that this one exists so I don't need to constantly be checking for that one uh okay so the part type weapon part is so part type dot in this case that's the grip so I'm going to grab so that's the attach point and then yeah and then from this one I'm going to basically yeah check the weapon part of so so if this one is known that means there's none so if so then I'm going to set parts and I'm going to go into the weapon partly so in order to get the weapon partisan list and I'm going to pass in a grip so I'm going to grab the list of groups and from this one I'm going to grab the very first grip so if there's no weapon then it's going to set down and if there is one then in next index so I'm going to first need to get the part index so for the part index I'm going to have to get this guy right here so it's going to be a list of weapon parts so weapon part that's a list so I grabbed that one and list of weapon parts from that one and then I do a index of and try to find the weapon that is currently on there so that is the important index so for the next part index that one take the part index plus one view a remainder of the weapon part list no not this one weapon part as soon as yeah I gotta be careful not to mix them both and do down like that and the next part index so I basically go into this one and exit on the next index okay I think that should do it this one is clicking so like nuts all right let's see uh what am I doing what's your opinion on test driven development I don't necessarily do test driven in the sense that I don't normally write tests but yep I definitely do find it I find the logic of focusing on it worrying about it I find that to be actually very oh this one is not uh I find it to be very useful to actually think about it so once personally I don't really usually uh write tests for my games I definitely do make sure that any code that I write I try to make it so that it would be possible to test it so I don't necessarily fully follow this driven development but yeah making sure that your code could be testable just having that in the back of your mind that will definitely help you make quite a lot better code all right look at that I can modify the grip that's cool okay nice so the barrel that one's actually going to be the trickiest one so I don't know why I started on that one uh but yeah all right so I can modify the grip so let's just add the buttons for the other ones and actually yeah just with that most of the system I don't already be working nice python Dove when I started Game Dev on your channel you don't like the brackets of my Game Dev Journey that's nice all right I'm glad my videos have come to you that's awesome that's really cool uh what am I doing okay so I need so I got the grip button let me add one What's called the stock button and the scope is actually going to be quite tricky so the scope button like this the stream of M1 to watch afterwards yep it won't be recording so yep afterwards it won't be available and of course what I'm doing here I'm basically making the system for a video so the phone uh tutorial or Showcase Video won't be coming out on Monday I hope Monday or Tuesday something like that so yep the the uh the live stream will be available and the phone video will also be available okay so modify the stock and then modify the scope okay that one is a bit too high looked it just a bit all right good uh okay so let's try adding all those parts and right now I know we need this testing code so I can get rid of this okay all right so that's good uh yeah set part and change change work I should do it change part instead but okay all right looks for the multiplier terminal is that how I find you oh nice that's awesome yeah multiplayer was a lot of fun searching for it so yeah that's that was it was really fun researching that because I hadn't done multiplayer in many many years so yeah that was great I'm glad you enjoyed that thank you uh okay let me go up here actually I don't need to modify anything here so in order to modify that one I just need one first of all I need the buttons so the stock and the scope buttons I need those actually that's a good question hmm once again the same question do I put them all together yes or no anyways for now let's make separate buttons and maybe I'll add it over here onto my thing but for now let's just make different buttons and then see what else happens okay so I got the stock button and I got the scope button and actually I'm going to modify that script but for now all right I just need to attach those so let me go into this guy on the part the touch Point let's put array size of three so I got the grip then I'm going to have the stock and I'm going to have the scope and for the attach points this is actually where it's going to be tricky so let me start from this one go inside this one make an empty game object name it the stock then drag it out and this way it has the exact same position okay let me put it inside the attached points and yep so that's the stock so I can actually take the stock and drag it inside there and disable it alright so that's the sound position uh the other one that I want is the scope naturally the Scopes are a little bit tricky where let's go there it is I don't know actually it's good I thought the Scopes would be with the pivot a bit different but no uh so let's go inside this is the scope attached point so let's go down here to the attach Point split the scope and drag the scope on there and disable it okay great as I'm adding more and more things this weapon is becoming more and more naked so that's funny anyways um yeah so I got the attached points so let's go into this one how do you make systems that work together well in unity I mean the answer is it depends on the quality of your code if your code is good well written nice and clean code then putting together system is actually super easy but if you write super dirty code you know just like I used to do 10 years ago yeah then Things become quite a bit more difficult so the answer to that is focus on writing good clean code and the better the code quality the easier it is to put together lots and lots of systems okay so I got the grip and now let me make a stock and actually I don't know how many stocks this includes so let me uh what do I want can I actually uh no I can't I thought I could do something but turns out I can't and tips on running cleaner code well I would say go watch my my complete course the going with this one was to focus on writing good clean code so if you go through there if you pay attention to all that by the end you won't have learned quite a lot so yeah learn a lot with your free course then you are that's awesome I'm glad it helped that was a ton of work but I'm really happy that the response to it has been so positive so nice thank you uh okay so let me get into the stock I need to pick up this guy can't I actually uh because dragging this is actually quite tricky so let me grab a different one okay so down here for the stock ah crap this one oh boy where was I where was I weapon a this one for the they're all these stocks can I unlock this one does that work oh it does work nice at least I think it works uh okay so where's the stock so let me grab just a handful of them so just stop one and two and then three just seven enough just to test it out so these top two and the stock three okay then I'm going to need a scope scope one so for this one let's call it a scope and let me find where's the scope and the scope is all the way over here so let's unlock and relock or is that it that is it lock it go down find the scope and let me grab which one is that one that one is a scope too okay let's go one two and three so let me grab don't scope two and that one is go three all right great so then on this one let me unlock it and just write the stocks and the Scopes drag them on there okay good so actually with this pretty much all of the codes should already be working just over here let me just refactor this so instead of making a function for each of them so change part and I'm going to receive a weapon part so that part type for the part type then I'm going to basically replace all of these references so down down and down okay so up here when I click on this one this one I want to modify the grip so let's go down the grip and on these other ones so on this one I'm going to modify the stock and on this one modify the scope okay and just like this I think everything should already be working so that one already has the attachments on the thing so let's see right and got an error what is the error uh did I not drag the buttons I didn't let me unlock this and there's the buttons okay so I need to add the stock button and the scope button okay ever considered making Unreal Engine 5 content uh in an Ideal World sure but in the reality where I have limited free time yeah that one is basically I mean it takes a lot of a lot of time to become an expert at something so in order for me to be able to teach unreal 5 I would need to spend a lot of time actually learning it so yeah I'd love to to learn it just for fun but yeah I'm learning it to the point where I can actually teach yeah that is probably not going to happen since someone takes so much time and effort so yeah for learning ue5 probably better to look elsewhere and look at that it does work except for some reason one of the stocks is a magazine why I don't know apparently I tried the wrong reference that's a stock that's a stock yeah that's a MAG I have no idea why did I drag a MAG I don't know but yeah the stock03 all right but yeah look at that it is working out bucket of games Thank you not much [ __ ] yeah that's awesome I mean thank you for the Super Chat thank you for being here watching the videos thank you for everything so yeah nice thank you okay and look at that so grips I can modify grip I can modify the scope and I can modify the stock and why is that one off this is kind of the the issue because I'm going to have to huh because the ah crap the same bug again all right I've only got to fix that bug yeah because every time I go it messes up but uh yeah so for this one mod Stock A yeah it is ah crap uh the weapon becoming um yeah but why is this one offset because some of the other ones they're all pretty good you know if I go inside this one yep the pivot is in there the pivot is in there and for this one for some reason the pivot is different and for this one it's also different yeah basically but that is easy to solve basically I'm going to need to make uh prefabs of my own Parts kind of so let me actually make for the prefabs and I'm just going to make a handful of them just right now um so let me just just fix that one just because that's a better night okay so what am I doing uh let me grab the so on the stock let me create an empty game object then go into the stock let me pick up stock three put it inside there and basically I need to offset it to where it makes sense okay that doesn't make sense so just gives pretty much the exact same name and let's make a prefab out of this one so if you ever have issues with uh modifying the pivot of some object this is how you do it you just make it a child of some other object and hopefully now it should be working all right uh okay so over here if I modify one two three there you go does work all right like that pretty cool just like this yeah it's already looking quite interesting it can modify the grip scope and all kinds of things all right so that's already pretty fun uh okay so the barrel and the underground those are actually going to be the trickiest things I wasn't expecting a buff dude that's funny all right thank you I guess uh yeah for me I love my two passions are programming and working out so yeah it's uh it's good because that's the only way that I can actually do what I do basically my biggest problem is when it comes to work life balancing that is always my tricky thing but the one thing that I never give up on is my time for going to gym and walking my dogs and that is really the one thing that helps me pretty much stay productive and helps me keep doing this for such a long time without burning out yeah it's the fact that I got those two things always okay all right so let's fix this annoying bug uh right theoretically can you make Unity just as good as unreal using egrp yep nowadays yeah pretty much I mean unreal probably still has a bit of an edge uh and the main thing they have is they have quick zone so they have all kinds of really photogrammetry assets so using good quality assets is quite a lot for making but Unity has the Adaptive probes volume and this one looks really awesome yeah right now it's only for herp but they are making it for urp soon so with this basically basically that's the issue is making something look good really comes to lighting quality and unity seems to be pushing more towards this direction so with that it should be very good so this is basically a way for adding uh probe volumes much easier it's currently on agrp and should be coming to Europe sometime in the future so yeah this is the one thing that I'm really looking forward to it being able to have screen space Global illumination just that one is great obviously raycasting is better but just that one is great so yeah definitely Unity is pushing towards having a bit more better Fidelity so that should be nice tips are good tutorials to learn Unity from your channel I mean if you're a beginner then go ahead watch my free course that one if you go through that one by the end you will have gained a ton of knowledge so yeah uh okay so what was I doing um right so the stock does work so the next thing is the barrel and that one is actually the one that is going to be really tricky because of the way that this weapon handles uh because the way that this system has because it's basically the barrel but I don't want to separate the barrel from the handguard sort of thing so I kind of want to put them together but the issue is that these have different shapes different sizes so that is going to be a bit tricky but let's put here the barrel what time is it oh damn it's already midday 20. yeah I guess it makes sense why my mouth is already quite dry because I'm really not made for for I was I doing as that yeah I always ask myself that uh yeah my mouth is definitely starting to be quite a bit dry anyways um okay so basically because I got the barrel and I want to include it with the hand card and the iron side so these are the three things that I want inside of the barrel and this is going to be the barrel touch point so basically I'm going to make uh right let me think because the issue is hey thank you so much for the super Channel thanks once again uh the issue is that over here this one actually includes multiple handguards on multiple sizes actually that's not an issue right now it's only an issue afterwards yeah so actually right now that might not be the problem unrecord yeah that is really awesome yeah yeah and recorded that one is definitely next level although the issue with that one the issue the uh why that one looks so good is not necessarily because of the essence even though obviously the s's are super high quality but it's more for the movement of the animation the way that the pistol is moving away from the from the face so the face is looking One Direction the pistol is looking another one that disconnect that is the one thing that really helps sell that one because that one really doesn't look insanely realistic and yeah it's because of using high quality assets with some that split in the animation so that is really interesting so but yeah that one is definitely a example of what's coming in the future as more and more devs have access to better and better tools yeah that is going to become much more common what kind dogs do you have uh they're a mixed breed so yeah no idea they're both medium size they're both sleeping they're both very very calm very chill so yeah they're nice uh okay so over here so I'm going to need basically a barrel and I'm going to basically have to build the barrels of different shapes hmm all right so this one's going to be a little bit tricky but let's see so I got a better one yeah I should have actually duplicated that one first so let me duplicate this one let me unpack this prefab what am I doing what am I doing where's the prefab prefab let me unpack this one and this one is going to be the barrel II and for the barrel two uh it's actually not the barrel ah crap I'm I'm thinking a bit too much uh make prefabs of barrels yeah but it's more that you know because I got like a tiny hand guard over here so I pretty much need to pick up that one and need to link up the barrel like this does it look okay I don't know and on such a small one do I also include the iron sight yes or no does that look actually I think that one looks good I think it looks better like that than oh crap than without the if I take away the iron side and put the barrel a bit more inside I don't know that also looks good I mean I guess maybe I could do barrels with and without iron sight you know maybe that could work anyways for now let's just include it and yeah it doesn't have some matches here but you could definitely do that I mean for this I'm focusing on maybe on something much more basic but yeah then afterwards you could all kinds of logic so yeah how to backup Unity projects the right way I mean for me usually I just do a super basic zip of the entire file but yeah that's not the the right way so if you want the right way I would say a Game Dev guide and where's the one where's the one he made a really nice video on how to use plastic SCM so this is unity's official version control tool so if that's the kind of thing that you're looking after definitely go ahead watch that video because yeah that is the builtin tool so that should be the one that is easy yeah the classic zip file because for me I may mostly do backups just for just for safekeeping pretty much so yeah for me super basic Zips work but yeah if you're working as a team then using Zips really isn't the best approach so yeah definitely go ahead and look into that one okay so Barrel two actually I'm going to name this brown one whether I call it brown two uh because this one is what is this one let me see it's based on the handguard so this one is the three so let's actually name this one the baron three oh crap so many clicks sorry trying to click underneath uh I think if UI tonkit is it production ready I did do quite a lot of research on it already uh I haven't made a video yet but I did do quite a lot of research and does seem that nowadays it is already pretty much ready although I don't think it is still I don't think it's runtime UI yet or am I wrong about that I don't know it's been a few months since I've seen it so is it now good for runtime UI uh but yeah basically the last time that I looked at it channel for 21 but on 121 I want to see for example version 22 do they recommend it okay so for the editor they recommend UI toolkit but for runtime they sound recommend the nty so yeah but yeah if you want to make editor Tunes I've looked into it and using UI tokit is so much easier than using I am going so if that's the kind of thing that you do definitely go and look into UI tokit that is definitely more than stable enough for that use case it just appears that for runtime it is not yet there so we shall see is there on version 23. now in 23 days I'll say the same thing but yeah definitely it's already advanced enough that you can actually start using it it's your first programming language I started doing IRC Scripts so I don't know what's the average age in chat but how many of you remember Merrick how many of you were on live back then yeah because that's pretty much how I started by making IRC Scripts so writing code to make this kind of thing I made all kinds of games kind of like hangman games trivia games so yeah that's pretty much how I started by learning how to do all kinds of those things it's kind of a scenelike language so yeah it was a it was definitely great to start like this I made my own thing on top so yeah it was pretty fun when born 91 someone remembers yeah it's definitely been quite a while but yeah this was a lot of fun really great yeah uh okay so let me continue making the barrels so I got the barrel two with that hand guard let me just move the uh what do I want just the hand guard too okay let me grab the Ironside and the barrel push it a little bit like that okay so then the barrel three is done and is there a four there no not this one the handle guard there's a yeah okay so there's a four so let me make the barrel four oh crap I can't see underneath the characters that that's the tricky part again let me just push it a bit just so I can work a little bit that's kind of the issue with the characters here um yeah so for the barrel let me grab the last one so the hand card 04 get rid this one take these two and push them out like this maybe push it out a bit further yeah because this one is this kind of barrel is more from like a sniper rifle something like that so yeah all right okay so anyway so just making all the various barrels so this is Barrel four this one is Barrel two and this one is we're on one okay so now let me make these script mode objects so the barrel one two three and four so the three ah crap uh so for the barrel two this one is a barrel one modify all these put them all as a barrel for the barrel one the brown two the barrel three and the barrel four okay so then on the weapon attachment system let's add another entry on this nice structure and this one is going to be for the barrel and the attach point is this one so the barrel attach point and yep thanks to how the color the code is all set up this should be it so let's try it out and I just forgot the brown button so let me actually just fix that one so up here for the on click on the barrel I'm actually going to do pretty much this modify the barrel all right and she don't like a new Marine Co routines can you elaborate on that point basically it's because the pattern they force you to use so you need to have a mono Behavior object so you need to have a game object then you need to make a function that returns I enumerator uh micro routine then inside you need to do return Eon do all kinds of things or you don't return that's the thing so you need to do that then you need to call and start Co routine and do a my core routine something like that so basically that whole this whole entire project the song this one structure being forced to use the amount of behavior being forced to use a game object being forced to call starco routine being forced to make an eye numerator with the end return basically for me I find this entire pattern to be way too convoluted this is way too unnecessary so that's pretty much it for me I find it so much easier to just do a basic flow timer it's a lot more straightforward at least for me so that is pretty much why I do that you can use a Singleton class yeah sure you can do that you can definitely work around it but personally for me I find all those requirements to get that pattern going I find that to be way too way too cumbersome so yeah for me that is why I just prefer super simple full timers that is really basic really easy to understand so yeah but it is uh just personal preference so if you don't like cool routines then by all means go ahead and use them there's nothing inherently wrong with them it's just because I personally do not like the pattern but if you do then go ahead and use them okay why did I mess up over here did I not add them yeah I forgot to add them to the list so appear on the weapon partner list let me unlock it and add the four new barrels and that's all I need to do and everything else should be working do you have problems learning to code are you one of the genius people I'm definitely not one of the genius people I'm similarly someone who has been writing code for many many years that is running it so yeah I definitely have problems I mean you can go rewatch this live stream and see how many errors I've got once building this system the only difference is simply when I find an error I try to fix it so I'll learn how to do it I do a lot of traveling error a lot of things so yeah I'm definitely not a genius just someone who has spent many many hours doing this sort of thing all right so look at that this is already working quite well so I got the scope I got the stock I got the grip oh it looks really nice so I can make a really tiny weapon or make something like a really long rifle and so on all right so honestly the only thing that I'm missing I think it's just the end Barrel and afterwards everything is already working quite well all right it's the logic of a class loaded on the Heap and if you follow the item on the quest the logic itself multiple times in memory uh the Heap is for I always confuse the Heap in the stack but yeah let's see okay I always confuse those but yeah I don't know so basically when you load an object to class is a reference type so that one is yeah it's on the Heap I think yeah structs our Valley type so those are the ones that go on the stack uh but yeah the logic itself multiple times in memory uh no I don't think so don't logic itself that's a good question but no I don't think so it's only the data that gets store actually I'm not 100 sure about that but either way the code itself isn't too much so yeah total nothing load the function multiple times right yeah because that's uh yeah it just it you've got a different reference for each uh instance of the class so if you unload the CL if you instantiate a class 100 times you are going to have a hundred times 100 references to that but yeah the code itself I don't think it's going to be repeated 100 times that would be very wasteful so yeah uh okay so what was I doing um all right let me do the Environ that is the one actually I made quite a bit of progress I didn't expect to be able to do all this in this live stream which has been going on for an hour and a half so all right so that's actually very good yeah I didn't expect to be doing all this so the end Barrel what do I call it what is a better name for this because I don't like the name and Barrel but yeah Barrel end and Barrel what do you call a tip ah I really don't like the name but anyways Veron and button and inside ah I really don't like the thing but Muslim all right that's good thank you yeah that definitely makes a lot more sense rather than barrel and thank you Muslim button is it an m416 the same thing is modular so you can make this pack is actually really nice I mean that's the reason why I'm doing this because this asset pack is going to be on a 70 discount on Monday next week so yeah they've got a bunch of presets over here so for example look at this one a really complex weapon then for this one some kind of heavy rifle and on this one this one is more of a regular looking rifle looks real nice nice red outside that's cool then there's also an SMG so basically all of these weapons are built using this modular system so with this you can see it looks really nice nice SMG then you got a giant sniper rifle some of these are based on the same thing so yeah so these look really nice yeah oh yeah this one can do pretty much without a a stock so that's fun that's done the intensity store it's the one on the where's my thing the cinti store it's a it's the military pack which is going to be it's going to be on the sale where's the other one the military yes this one which is going to be 70 off uh next week so that is why I'm doing this because say run a nice pack so if you need some things yeah thanks for always being so nice funny YouTube Ah that's awesome thank you for being here thanks for watching the videos thanks for commenting it's a twoway street so yeah thank you all so much okay are you just changing the gun objects on buttons click yeah that's pretty much it just having different objects and different objects that change in different ways and that is it okay so uh where was I the muzzle all right so let me actually rename that one because Muslim does make a lot more sense so thanks for that tip so instead of Barrel in Muslim okay more multiplayer netcut tutorials yeah I definitely want to do that I mean I'm currently working on my steam game which is based on multiplayer so yeah that is definitely a topic that I won't be covering quite a bit more in the future Okay so uh right yeah that's the issue with the with the muzzle it's the attach point for it yeah or hmm no yeah it is tricking yeah this one is quite a bit tricky why the script compilation take forever I mean that depends on what kind of things you have but you can definitely look into a simply definition oh crap assembly definition Unity yeah if you got problems with code compilation taking way too long definitely look into assembly definitions it's a bit tricky to set up also have a lecture on this in my ultimate TNT overview course so if you have that you can go watch that but yeah if you want to if you want to speed up compilation you can do this and basically with this if you modified just something inside the library then it only recompiles this one rather than wrinkle following everything so it can definitely help with with the compilation times for me usually that's not an issue because usually most projects on the list they are super long most projects compile in like two seconds so for me never really does that yeah strongly naming things too yeah picking good names is definitely one of the toughest parts so yeah definitely having help with that is always very useful okay so on the weapon attachment system let me add another part and for this other part this is going to be the muzzle and drag the Muslim reference all right so yeah for the buttons this one is actually pretty easy and I should probably refactor this code got to do it in a little bit rather than having so many individual reference or actually I could and I couldn't it works either way uh anyway so yeah do it in order to modify the muzzle so what did I do the muscle so that's all I need to do over there and really just building parts so thankfully this system is actually quite easy if you've ever done Android iOS games I've done some research on that area but no not really for me it's a I usually stick with just uh I usually stick with just PC games that's the thing that I've grown up on the thing that I've learned so yeah mostly do you know the Hot Wheel plugin yeah I do think that I've I'm pretty sure I didn't look at it in one of my assets list videos and I'm pretty sure nowadays it is actually free so I'm pretty sure it didn't be hot reload there's an asset that is now free is it this one okay I don't know but yeah yeah so apparently there's a yeah so I've seen it and it doesn't look very interesting so definitely something that I would like to research yeah look at that it's a ENT verified solution and it is free so yeah this is definitely one of the things that I wouldn't like to research as soon as I can find the time because yeah if you got problems with with doing it yeah you can you can definitely learn this how do you spin the pencil well basically many years ago I got into pen tricks even though I'm not very good as you can see ah yeah so I started learning from it quite a long time ago yeah if you go on pentrix tutorial as always nowadays you can really find so many things in so many places yeah look at that you can do the charger oh I could do that one but not anymore that also requires a specific thing yeah the the thumb around that's the basic one and the thing above I don't remember what that one was called yeah going up like that that's cool yeah that was fun definitely something that I I would like to get a little bit better anyways um yeah uh let me share this project GitHub link Yep this one I'm based on making this for a tutorial which should be out next week so yep uh okay so let me just continue doing this a little bit more what was I doing modified muzzle so basically I just need to make the prefabs so for the oh actually that's good because for the muzzle I also need to be able to enable no Muzzle so hmm okay so let me go inside make a prefab and for the muzzle yeah they got some Muslim breaks then there was a silencer wasn't it yep there's a silencer there's a bunch of silencers okay so let me put in there called muzzle one yeah the issue is going to be how to position it that's what's going to be really tricky well let's start with just Amazon one start with just one and then see if everything works so the muzzle one this one is going to be of type muzzle and this one is going to be a muzzle one all right so just with this I should be able to oh crap I can't see sorry uh let me see underneath just disable this one okay oh crap uh what did I forget of course I forgot the button always forgot the button uh okay so I can select the grip the stock the scope the barrel and the muzzle crashes why did you crash did I forget to drag the reference no I didn't so what happened oh right I forgot to drag it onto the parts list that's why yeah and for that one I need to I need to go into to be able to allow none yeah see this kind of problem so like this it does work but the problem is that the Muslim position that one has to be based on the barrel size otherwise it goes inside okay so let me think how am I going to do this because basically the muzzle requires an offset could I do maybe a barrel whistle I have a project where I only use an Arduino board in combination with DNT the game will be a multiplayer game oh that's nice it's stored data from the sensor in form of Time series for each player to analyze them later for a suitable database yeah I really don't know sorry that kind of very uh yeah I mean you need some database online and there are tons and tons of them but yeah I'm really not familiar with the pros and cons of all of them so yeah I know that Azure has a bunch of things so if you want to learn how to do that I did do some research I did cover some Azure tutorials so if you want to learn how to interact with Azure from Unity go ahead and watch those videos uh but yeah probably touching Muslim point to the barrel so uh not really because I don't want to put the attach Point as a challenge of a spawn object so that would be kind of dragging so basically I need the burnless so to contain like the offset for the Muslim position that's kind of what I need to do but the kitchen chaos multiplayer course will help me create the local multiplayer version that's not really the focus on the course but yeah sure I mean if you go through the course and then you learn about the input system which is used in the course if you do that then yeah it should be relatively easy to convert it to a local multiplayer yeah how do you instantiate that weapon with a specific attachments you choose for that I really just need to store the so basically over here the weapon it's all stored inside this dictionary right here it's got the part which inside has a weapon part so so I would basically just need to save that so I'm going to do that in a little bit but yeah it's pretty much I just say the weapon card so so let me just do the muzzle and then I'll do the saving and loading okay so for the muzzle all right I think the best thing of all is to make hmm I I wonder if this works so if I make what do I need I need the barrel weapon part so so if I make this one the barrel weapon part itself so this one is going to be a script long object and on this one basically I just need a public Vector 3 for the muzzle offset so I think like this or actually yeah it shouldn't be a vector three just a float muzzle offset okay so I think just like this now if I go up here and I make a barrel weapon part of so Barrel one yeah I just need a different name oh crap that's not no not scriptable object but needs to extend weapon part so you know this is what I want does this work oh maybe it does work all right okay so I think this might this might actually work hmm all right okay okay this might work uh with this Barrel Old okay so we got the barrel one and I'll just make two of them I'll correct this side so the barrel one and then I got a barrel two okay so now I just need to go inside the barrel with that one and basically for the Muslim position that's going to be pretty much just a point inside of it so it's going to be offset by let's say by this much so by Point 1432 so if I go into this one point 1432 and then if instead of this one if I've got the barrel two so for the barrel two make a new game object for this one the offset is going to be something like this I think Sunday Brown 2 I have this offset so that way I have a bit more information when it's a barrel as opposed to something else okay uh send this so I change the parts yeah I think I think it is like this right so I changed the part I said the part transform okay great so if uh if this weapon part as so dot part type if it equals a barrel so if this one is a barrel then I'm going to go into this one weapon part dot muzzle so this is going to be the Muslim part attach points Muslim Parts attach points I'm going to go into this one and in the attachpoint transform Dot dot position equals and I'm going to put it this one dot attach Point transform dot position Plus amazing the position uh does right work okay now a bit I'm a bit confused right now but yeah so on this on the right times the all right I need to grab down uh so I need to get what I call it the barrel weapon part itself okay Barrel weapon part so equals this weapon part is so as bear on weapon part is so okay so let me get the attach point for the barrel just to make things a bit more clear okay so I get the barrel weapon carton that I'm going to position the muzzle on the barrel dot position was the right is that the right I don't know if it is the right but yeah that one dot muzzle offset okay I think like this it might be working so let's see all right forward from Turkey improving myself more and more everyday thanks to your videos oh that's awesome yeah I'm glad my videos have held you that's really cool best of luck in your Learning Journey nice uh uh oh I still haven't fixed that issue I thought I fixed it but yeah um if I put a bear on where are you moving put the bear on and got a known reference did I not telling muzzle uh on the Muslim I did add it alright bye thanks for being here thank you uh what exactly was not here this one is known no this one can't possibly be no this one is also not known is the barrel part does this one know how do I make good input prediction that's a very complex topic so not really something that can be answered right away that really depends on your on the context whatever you are trying to do so the barrel got no reference what is it the baron weapon partiso is this the one that is known do I need to cast it instead of doing as Maybe still get that special happy feeling when you get something to work probably yeah of course whenever something works it is always amazing like for example this there you go got a null error I think the biggest difference is as a beginner sometimes you get frustrated when you see an error whereas for me I know that's just part of the process so the fact that I'm seeing this error doesn't bother me it's just perfectly normal part of the process so in this case I'm pretty sure the issues that I can't I need to cast it instead of doing as checking if it's a bear not a muzzle which one did I grab yeah that makes oh no yeah no it it is the logic is correct it's just over here that I forgot to add it oh crap this kind of oh actually no yeah I forgot the unity has the thing for sorting the things all right so that's good so nine so I can get rid of the other elements so put it on 10 and then add the barrel one basically the issue was that I had forgotten to add the new script object type so like this it should be working so like this Barrel any up there you go got no errors and where is the muzzle uh right yeah this is the thing it's positioned on the right where it should be on the fourth Vector so four instead of right so up here for the forward instead of the right one all right what about the errors that is not about your code like when using an external plugin yeah that part is definitely a lot more frustrating but thankfully that doesn't usually happen so yeah did you fix the bug where the weapon flicked around nope not yet it is not yet fixed so here yep there you go the muzzle is in there yeah there you go that annoying I really gotta fix that because that's annoying uh yeah so got the barrel and got the other barrel and yep it did work all right look at that the barrel position is indeed changing so I can put a muzzle and there you go it does work all right awesome yeah there you go I mean snake and what the input to feel good well the first thing you need to do is actually Define what exactly do you mean by feeling good because that can mean a billion different things so yeah do you have a game development what would you tell yourself when you first started on this pad well what I would say is write a lot of code make a lot of games so pretty much what I ended up doing so yeah there's really no no shortcut to game development you really you just built something and you keep making things so I made a really nice video quite a long time ago on seven steps yeah that one which is basically just make a bunch of tiny games then make a bunch of small games then make a bunch of medium games and make a bunch of large games that's really it I mean experience really is one of the most important things so definitely spend a lot of time making a lot of games for me one of the things that helped me quite a lot was how I spent five years making Flash games and Flash Games by the by definition are only super tiny so in those five years I made about 40 games and that gave me a ton of knowledge with regards to programming how to write code how to do game development with regards to game design trying all kinds of game genres so yeah basically made tons and tons of games and with experience Things become so much better how many finished projects did you have before publishing something because what does publishing something mean that's kind of the issue because uh in flash games yeah I published about 40 of them and I probably had another I don't know at least 20 or 30 other unfinished prototypes but when it comes to Steam games I actually don't have too many because usually when I decide on a steam game idea when I actually decide on it and start really building something by then I'm pretty Focus that this is going to be my same thing so actually when it comes to steam game projects for that only I actually don't have too many unfinished prototypes uh right I'm a senior phone stack that with a good salary but I'm hating my job what can I do to change the game though uh yeah definitely start by watching the course and see if it is something you like but yeah I would say I would definitely say don't jump don't if you got a good job definitely don't quit it before you have a good alternative because making money with game development is really difficult so yeah I would say stick with your job even if you hate it that sucks but yeah that's stick with it and do Game Dev on the side and maybe when you get to the point where your side Game Dev when that one is actually providing income then maybe you can make the phone jump but yeah I would definitely say don't quit it until you do it because game development is really difficult yeah uh right did you enter the cinti jam uh no because I usually don't have time for game Jam so I normally don't do game jams but yeah that doesn't look really interesting so if you that if you have some time we'll definitely encourage you to do that I mean personally I love their style that's why I'm using oh can you still hear me did something go down I got a random notification from OBS saying reconnected so did this go down is it live I don't know I think so okay I think it's live again okay something went down all right okay good uh okay right so let me let me finally fix that bug that annoying bug about the rotation so basically let me do a debug.log on the mouse Delta and see which is the one causing problems because I think it's only on the rotate how do I get input a specific controller what do you mean by that I don't know what you mean but go and look into the input system the input system basically you can get all kinds of inputs so it depends on how you have it set up but yeah looking to use the new input system and doing that kind of thing should be relatively simple okay so I rotate all right and the issue is when I click away and then I click back yeah there you go the Y is on minus 600 and I think that's the issue yeah if the Y is huge on the negative or negative or positive because if I go here then I click outside on the left side and yeah that one rotates but does not flip so the issue is with the with the Y so I can actually do most y equals math crack meth I always get wrong method.claim let's clamp the mouse down to dial y between I don't know minus 200 and plus 200. don't fix it so if I go here I rotate I click away and I click back and there you go now it has been clamped so it no longer flips up down left right if I go yeah I should probably clamp the X as well just so it doesn't do that massive thing so any most Dante on the X also put it same thing so this fix huge jumps when when Unity loses Focus all right meth yeah meth is a tiny typical to right but yeah uh okay favorite hobbies I don't like walking my dogs I don't know if that counts as a hobby I love working out going to the gym oh crap I close it um so yeah I love walking around running oh man I messed up I put it on 16x9 and put it on the side there and maximize that's what I want all right great you say it's your own job I never had a regular job so I am not the right person to ask about that hey look at that this is the weapon all right okay let me just fix the other barrels and enable the ability to choose a no Muzzle uh so let me go let me call it muzzle zero and yeah for the muscle zero I'm just going to do wasn't like this except there's nothing inside of it that's a pretty basic so the muscle zero you got the Muslim zero and on the weapon part list let's set the muzzle zero okay so on the barrel let me make the other Barrel so there are three and the crap and the barrel four keys are just moving there yep I'm here I am Portuguese so I was born here in Oliveira it's okay to move the character in fixed update it depends on what you're doing if you are moving using physics then yep you should be doing it on fixed update but if you are moving by modifying the velocity which is what I usually do for that one you don't have to do it on the fixed update you can do it on update because modifying the velocity of the rigid body that doesn't actually modify the the uh doesn't actually move the object so for that one if you're just modifying the velocity you can do it on the regular update which is what I normally do so it's been a while since I made a regular character controller but yeah this one over here this one is still a nice tutorial so on there yeah I use physics in order to move it and yeah I do that Game Dev yep go ahead and watch the free 10 hour course so if you go through that course you won't learn quite a lot uh okay so what am I doing uh right the position on the barrel so let me put the barrel three reset and the barrel four crap uh let me find the positions for both these okay sure I mean I'm speaking English just because I assume most people uh in chat uh just no English not Portuguese but yeah sure I can yeah uh okay so let me put this put a empty game object push it to the side and for this one and pretty much like that so this is the offset so for the this one is what Baron 3 and put on this offset okay and then for the barrel four let me offset it by a little bit more so something like this on this offset like this okay good great so on this one if I add the barrel three and the barrel four and yep now it should be working okay great oh boy my voice is already very messed up you see about MVC patterns uh I've never used it uh I know that it's super used in things like web development and so on I haven't looked into it because of the when I was researching Azure a lot of those Azure things do you use that pattern so yep I'm aware of it but yeah I've never really used it and I don't think in game development it is used quite a lot but yeah if that is something that you're already familiar with it can be really great for I like how it forces you to separate so the logic from The View I almost forget which is which so the model that's like the structure then the view then things so yeah it does help with separating things out which can be quite useful so yeah uh all right so yeah so this is working I can put the muzzle barrels of different lengths and the muscle is positioning correctly then I got the stock the grip and all of these and there you go all right nice okay great all right get input from a specific controller player input and player input manager components you asked the the input system uh I remember it's you've got the control schemes or it's not the control scheme I don't know because on input system multiple characters there was yeah there you go crossplatform control so watch this video on unity's channel they've covered something like that where they got multiple characters all of them driven with the same thing so they use it in order to Define which characters they use so yeah they made a bunch of these videos so definitely look into that one uh okay so what am I doing all right let me just make a quick save load system so let's go up here and as usual make a private a class save object so I got the save object and am I just going to store all the parts that is always the thing that I always have trouble remembering which is does it automatically serialize yes or no said you were using a create function method what create function Singleton dead no that's a great very useful pattern personally I really like it so yeah Code Monkey Gym and Fitness video yeah maybe one day I'll do a second Channel yeah yeah lately for me it's a I go to gym do regular bodybuilding Fitness stuff then usually on the weekends I do a bit more running and lately I've been more into rock climbing so yeah do a lot of things yeah maybe one day I'll do a second Channel just focus on Fitness that would be funny where are you from I'm from Portugal uh all right so for the okay so for the same object I want yeah I think this is actually going to be weapon part is so weapon part as soon list and I think this actually does not work so so probably not public ah private Droid save and on Save let me go and you save object and inside the save object for the weapon partisan list I'm going to need a list of weapon particle weapon partiso list make a new list and basically I'm going to go do a four each on this guy ah crap trying to uh so for each on the parts type attach Point part type attach Mark crop I'm already starting to miss okay so go on to this one so if this one dot weapon part is so it is not known that means there's something on there so on the weapon partisan list let me do an ad and add this guy right here down this is the same object same object and then I take this save object and I do a Json utility to Json and convert this into Json so that's the string Json and let me do a debug.log in order to save this Json so this is the save and appear on the update let's do some testing so if input get key down on the T key when that happens let's try saving okay I have bad social anxiety when I lose control of volumes and stuff oh damn that's difficult yeah gem is dangerous yeah I mean yeah definitely start by working out at home that's definitely an option although I would definitely also encourage you to I don't know try to beat that essentially what I'm saying is a lot of people get really selfconscious about going to gym but personally I can tell you my point of view as someone who goes to gym five six times a week for me I don't really pay attention to anyone so if I see anyone who's a beginner who's something I'm really not paying attention I'm just focused on my own thing so that's usually something that people have a fear which is one of those sort of imaginary fears what I mean is the other people most of them are probably not judging you especially the ones who are who are there regularly they're just focused on their own thing so if that is your concern I would say I would say personally for me I I've never felt the desire to mock someone at the gym I mean we're all there to improve ourselves so yeah I would say basically if I saw you at the gym I would not have any negative opinions upon you so I would say focus on that and focus on the fact that the social anxiety that is probably all in your head and all the other people they're just focusing on their own thing so focus on your own I mean Fitness is all about selfimprovement so so yeah do that but if you if you can do it at home then definitely do it I mean for me I prefer going to gym there's much more much more equipment much more things but yeah whatever you can do it always helps yeah yep we are all at the gym for the same reason so yeah and yeah cold sandwich yeah thank you for the Super Chat most important teacher of my life that is awesome yeah I'm glad the videos have helped you thank you so much all right uh okay what was I doing kind of forgot uh all right let me choose a bunch of things and press on T and nope it did not save of course this is always this issue that I was sort of concerned with yeah I'm already for two years nice yeah yeah it's a great experience yeah people are really nice yeah for the most part people will go there they're really especially people who are the regulars who know that the eventually things yeah really nice uh so for the weapon party yeah that's a problem because it does not automatically do so the weapons part is so yeah I gotta save it by name so I gotta do a string so I got a weapon partiso name so a list of string for the weapon part is so name list do a new list and then I'm going to do a four for each weapon so it's weapon particle weapon party so in the weapon part as so list so I go through that one and then I go on to this one and I add any word part so dot name so I add the name and then I save the name and now it should work oh another one nice hey thank you so much for the Super Chat Super Chat cuteness oh hey generally hey how's it going bye croissant yeah thank you nice yeah I hope you had a nice flight back I hope that was fun yeah hope you're doing well that's cool thank you uh right so press T anyway uh nope okay so now that's range that should have worked okay why did that not work wait is that one no it's not that one oh this one that counts am I not adding this one should be adding why are you not adding this video be on YouTube later yep this won't be recorded and of course the reason why I'm doing this is for a uh for a tutorial video which will be coming out sometime next week so yep that is the goal okay at things save and nope why are you invisible am I doing did I not save it oh never mind oh God ah sometimes I really mess up things yeah I'm going through the list but obviously the list doesn't have anything attached to it oh boy so that's not what I want so it's on this one dot keys is the key the weapon part type it is right or no is it no I don't remember and parttime parttime attached point so yeah oh boy so this is going to be the weaponpartiso that part type part type and then I go into so the part type attach point so part type attach point it is this one on this part's type so I get that one and then I do that and now it should work all right can I get a dedicated server for free uh not really I mean someone has to pay for it so if you want to use the lowest cost possible I would encourage you to use ENT relay because that one does have a very generous free tier but yeah getting a proper dedicated Center for free I mean someone has to pay for that so I don't think you're gonna find something for free all right awesome there you go it's saving that one sectionally maybe was it working previously hmm because it seems that it wasn't a weapon party so if I do the weapon partisan list and I put the weapon partisan list I don't think this won't work but still let's try it can run a micro ec2 an AWS free tier really forever or just say or just saying onetime thing because yeah I haven't actually looked into AWS when it comes to Cloud I've really unlocked at Azure and yeah I don't think they have anything that is 100 free on the time but yeah oh look at that so this actually might have worked okay all right so I thought it wasn't working but it really only wasn't working because of the because of the thing yeah just for a year per account oh okay so it's one of those promotional things 50 50 ccus isn't that much generous it really is I mean when it comes to Indie Games it is so difficult to to reach people to some copies so yeah 50 concurrent users that is a massive amount that is something like a thousand copies so if you sell a thousand copies on the first uh month of release then you can easily afford the cost that they charge for really so for me that one is either your game doesn't make it too well in which case you don't have to pay anything for the Relay or your game does very well and the cost of the relay is super mini skill so either way I think that one is an excellent thing okay right so I need to hey another Super Chat hey thanks again for sharing thanks so much nice like a gym all right thank you that's nice thank you all so much uh Muslim can be better without a barrel yeah I need to add some some uh some testing over that anyways um right so a private void load so unload I'm going to receive a string for the Json and I take Json and can I just convert directly I don't think so so the same object passing the Json and save object save object so I'm not sure if this is going to work but let's see let's do a debug.log on this one that weaponpartisan list dot count let's see if this one does find it and let's see if it does okay just need bit of testing so up here on the update let's go do another king on the y key let's go with and loads I speak it appears on my character's head yep yep it does oh got in there what did I do wrong they're not calling mode all right I gotta pass in the Json uh right let me just copy paste actually I've got the yeah I've got the Json right here so let me use a fixed Json for now string Json let me copy this guy can I copy it directly like this yeah there you go it does work I think this work oh right yeah I oh boy this is way too much text uh the Json ends here okay so let's see if this one does work I don't like channels Khan but we can look at light mode sorry but my issue is the opposite as I cannot look at dark mode so sorry I really wish that it was Dynamic I really wish I could look at light mode and you can look at dark mode but yeah videos aren't really Dynamic so it's uh difficult uh right so I did it so I press on Y and it did work wow okay nice I didn't expect to work that easily but yep it does work okay cool oh boy no my pen oh boy my my dogs are starting to wake up so I think it's gonna be about time let me just fix this challenge Japan uh right okay so yeah I just want to actually load it and it's actually going to be super easy right so I just gotta go for each weapon part so weapon part so in the weapon part is in the save object ah crap in the save object that weapon part as soon as second through that and call set part and set this weapon part so and yeah that should really be about it with that it should be saving automatically actually I don't need the yeah I don't need the name I just need the weapon part itself so I can actually get rid of this any Json probably still works so I don't need the name I don't need these things okay let's see do you have to master data structures and Algos for Game Dev uh now really I mean definitely helps to know but uh well with any other yield then loads I can put something completely different and then unload and there you go all right awesome great it works uh so yeah data structures now goes it does help to know them but yeah you don't need to I mean if you ask me to Define what is a bubble sort or quicksort or any of those things yeah I couldn't tell you I really don't know the I know how to store things but I don't know the name behind the algorithms but yeah so you don't need to know the technical things behind it but uh but yeah it does help to know how things work in general yeah General tips for using generics or interfaces I mean it depends on the context so yeah it really depends on the context so for example if you want to use if you want a good use cases well first of all I've got uh videos on those so on the generics and interfaces so if you want to unlock that for example when it comes to interfaces I've got the what did I call it interact with the record this one yeah how to talk to NPCs so if you want to see a very specific use of how interface can help you then this video is right so it teaches you how to use interface in order to be able to interact to talk with a person or push a button or open a door so interface are really good for that and all my videos on my grid system all of these are really based on using generics for the grid map so if you want a practical use case of generics definitely use that is playing their best for making your own assets uh it's one of the most widely used tools so yeah I do think blender is really great I've only learned the base of it but yeah as far as I know blender is a very good tool so definitely if you learn about it you won't be able to do tons of assets um all right so yeah so basically here the system is pretty much only working so I can modify all these let me just do a bunch more so just a few more minutes let me make a few more parts and then I gotta go because my voice is already pretty messed up uh let me do a bunch more muzzles that should be fun Muslim two and Muslim three uh because there are a bunch of Muslims over here I got a Muslim break these don't look really intense and another silencer so let me go over here on the muzzle so muscle one okay so on the Muslim 2 let's go with the last uh you know a sound turn and on the Muslim three let's go with one of these Muslim breaks let's go this one which is this one yeah that one looks good okay all right so down here I just need to add the muzzle two and the Muslim three just need them to listen don't need to touch the code at all once again thank you so much for description nice thank you uh Barrel scope grip Barrel Muslim one and there you go that one and a nice Muslim break all right that's cool so I can put a bunch of silencers I can put them nothing and so on and for the barrel it can be of any size so it can be really long it's like this and a real long stock there you go really long rifle that's nice not like that that looks pretty cool so yeah then I can press on T in order to save it and there you go let me just copy this yeah we just need to implement some saving onto a file instead of onto a fixed Json here but for now this works so let me just get rid and only find the Json there we go now I can get back to this rifle anytime I want so so let's try it out this game development need math I mean you need the basics but you don't need anything too special I mean over here on the making of this system I really only use math just over here for handling the rotation of the weapon so everything else really is just logic there's no no math involved in any of these so yeah you don't need to be a math expert you see the people at the bottom yep I do which makes it sometimes a bit different difficult to touch the button so unload and there you go here's my weapon and I can load something completely different then load again and there you go nice so I got some nice saving and loading look at that the camera the main camera where's my main camera for the near 0.01 there you go all right okay all right so I think that's gonna be it because my voice already messed up and I actually did manage to do quite a lot I didn't think that I'd be able to to build pretty much the entire system but turns out that it actually went quite well so I can modify all these and I can load them save them and so on just need to add all the parts for all the other remaining things but yeah in terms of logic all right I still need the under barrel and modify the mag and so on BM most of the core concept is all over here and it actually looks quite nice I'm quite pleased with this okay great all right okay so yeah definitely stay tuned for the video sometime next week and the video is going to coincide when this pack is on 70 off so definitely don't go ahead and pick it up right now wait for next week because those should be like this more likes to informal logic tasks yeah definitely whenever I got something that I need to do like this yep I will be doing this yeah we're applying to the channel yes this live stream won't be saved and then the final edited video won't come out next week all right okay so my voice is really already messed up so I think that's gonna be it so I'm working good so I'm looking good all right okay so let me just put on the characters just look at my OBS see how things are going like that all right okay great so yeah thank you
