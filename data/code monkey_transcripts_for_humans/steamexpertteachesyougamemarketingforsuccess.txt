02:14 - Market a game and basically every single
02:17 - week I write a quick blog post studying
02:19 - the steam Marketplace to see what is
02:21 - actually helping people Market their
02:23 - games I look at games that have
02:24 - succeeded and I break down their
02:26 - strategy step by step these are real
02:28 - stories these aren't theories or
02:30 - anything I also do broad-based surveys
02:33 - and data analysis where I like scrape
02:35 - data from steam or I go to data that has
02:38 - been scraped by somebody else and I just
02:40 - kind of look at market trends and see
02:41 - what's going on so that you can actually
02:43 - Market your game get it seen get it sold
02:46 - and actually do this for a full-time
02:47 - living all right yeah that's awesome I
02:49 - mean I have to say that I'm myself I've
02:50 - learned quite a lot by reading your blog
02:52 - by reading the newsletter I've been
02:53 - reading it for many years and a lot of
02:55 - what I know about marketing came from uh
02:57 - reading you so thanks for doing that
03:00 - uh all right so yeah so I guess uh we're
03:02 - going to start off with a quick
03:03 - presentation like a high level overview
03:05 - on the things must know about steam game
03:07 - marketing and then I'll ask a bunch of
03:09 - follow questions so yep go ahead sounds
03:12 - great yeah so um as Hugo mentioned um I
03:15 - do this uh professionally and I teach
03:17 - others and the way I do that is I I
03:19 - create this course this online course
03:20 - called how to Market a game wish list
03:22 - and visibility Master Class um we've
03:25 - probably got a link down below for this
03:27 - thing um but um as part of this uh what
03:30 - I teach is really how to Market your
03:33 - game and the way that it works is a lot
03:34 - of Indies get frustrated because they're
03:36 - always like tweeting tweeting Tweeting
03:38 - or they always post on Reddit and it
03:41 - goes nowhere like it's like what else do
03:43 - I need to do and really what a lot of
03:46 - Indies don't understand or it's not as
03:48 - apparently visible is the real strategy
03:51 - for how you do this and and and I'll
03:52 - kind of break it down is basically the
03:54 - underlying thing is you by yourself just
03:57 - tweeting out into the void is not enough
03:59 - to actually just Market the game like
04:01 - not enough people can see your tweets or
04:03 - your Reddit posts or whatever platform
04:06 - you do you need somebody else to help
04:09 - you boost that up and the primary way
04:12 - that actually works to actually get
04:15 - visibility on your game are couple ways
04:18 - the first is online festivals these are
04:20 - festivals where you
04:22 - apply they feature your game on the
04:24 - front page of steam because steam
04:26 - features these all the time and then all
04:29 - these people are going going through
04:30 - Steam they see this big banner that says
04:31 - hey like City build Builder festival and
04:34 - you're making a city Builder and you
04:36 - click and you go in and you have your
04:38 - game right there on the top now these
04:39 - festivals run all the time and my
04:42 - community U manages a list where we find
04:45 - these festivals people come to me people
04:46 - are starting to come to me who organize
04:47 - these festivals and say hey Chris can
04:49 - you feature this Festival we're doing
04:50 - this type of festival and so what you do
04:53 - is you just track it you you subscribe
04:55 - my newsletter or my Discord I guess
04:56 - we'll put a link down below and you just
04:58 - get notified when a new and if it
05:00 - applies to your game and your situation
05:03 - you know you just apply for it hopefully
05:04 - get in that is a huge way to get wish
05:07 - lists the second way is from streamers
05:10 - just like Hugo but mostly the um General
05:14 - audience that you know makes that plays
05:17 - games and sends those to the general
05:18 - audience Hugo you're you're great but
05:20 - it's more for developers um we're
05:23 - talking let's players and know big ones
05:24 - are like splatter cat Northern lion iron
05:28 - pineapple if you're making
05:30 - a Souls like game these streamers bring
05:32 - in so much traffic and sometimes people
05:34 - trip up with the term streamer I just
05:35 - mean somebody who plays games online
05:37 - that could be YouTube or twitch but
05:39 - YouTube really provides more traffic I
05:41 - find and so basically you take your game
05:44 - you give it to them and they play it and
05:46 - then you get tons of wish lists it
05:47 - doesn't necessarily lead directly to
05:50 - sales a lot of people think that
05:51 - streamers once your game goes on sale is
05:54 - going to lead to a big cash influx it
05:55 - does not typically what happens is you
05:58 - give it to them you get a ton of wish
05:59 - wish list and then the next time your
06:00 - game goes on discount then all those a
06:03 - lot of those wish lists will convert
06:04 - about 20% of those wish lists if it's a
06:06 - good streamer so the combination of
06:09 - those two things are the primary way
06:12 - that most games get visibility on Steam
06:15 - it is not you just sending out little
06:18 - tiny tweets here and there um it really
06:20 - takes these big efforts um and so it's
06:23 - about um you know just knowing where
06:25 - these places are how to apply and what
06:27 - to get what you need to do to get that
06:30 - visibility and um oh somebody always
06:32 - asks too with streamers hey how do I get
06:34 - streamers to play my game it's very
06:36 - simple if your game is interesting you
06:37 - have to have a good steam page with
06:39 - great graphics looking good a good
06:42 - thumbnail that you did not do yourself
06:44 - don't make your own thumbnail because
06:46 - you need a professional illustrator to
06:48 - make something interesting because
06:50 - YouTubers live or die by their thumbnail
06:52 - I'm sure Hugo knows that if your
06:53 - thumbnail is not good people don't click
06:56 - and watch your video so streamers need
06:58 - good graphics for that thumbnail and if
07:00 - your page has a great thumbnail
07:02 - streamers are more likely to play your
07:04 - game because they say ah that looks like
07:06 - a great thumbnail all I have to do is
07:07 - copy that put that in put my face on it
07:10 - and then we're good to go but if you
07:12 - have an ugly thumbnail now the streamer
07:13 - is like oh God I gotta go find somebody
07:16 - to make a thumbnail for me out of a
07:17 - screenshot they have to do more work
07:19 - they want good graphics good thumbnails
07:22 - then two what you got to do is put up
07:24 - your demo now this is an important thing
07:26 - too many people skip this step you want
07:28 - a nice demo that's really fun and you
07:30 - keep it up and all you do is you message
07:32 - the streamer and you say hey I'm making
07:33 - this game you play this type of game uh
07:36 - I think you're going to like this you
07:37 - grab your thumbnail say here's my
07:39 - thumbnail you grab a link to your demo
07:40 - say Demo's live now you can play it
07:42 - right now and you send that off to the
07:44 - streamer if they like your game they
07:46 - will play it now a lot of people say
07:48 - Chris I tried all this and nobody uh
07:50 - nobody responded uh it must be going to
07:53 - spam it did not go to spam it's just
07:55 - that streamers don't have enough time to
07:56 - play every game that comes across their
07:58 - desk so they don't write no not because
08:00 - they hate you or they're afraid to tell
08:02 - you no it's just it it's just a list
08:05 - that they have of games that they're
08:06 - kind of interested in playing and if a
08:07 - hot one comes in it just cuts in front
08:09 - of you in line because the stream is
08:10 - like oh I got to play this new game and
08:12 - yours just gets bumped down so it's not
08:13 - that they don't like your game it's just
08:15 - that you're not as exciting as the other
08:17 - games that came in that's why they don't
08:19 - say no to you and say oh I'm not going
08:20 - to cover this nobody says no it's just
08:23 - if you've been up sending out the emails
08:25 - and you're not getting responses maybe
08:26 - it's time to either up the the steam
08:29 - page make it look a little bit more
08:30 - exciting tighten your pitch tighten your
08:32 - demo and then you'll start to get those
08:34 - responses from streamers so that's the
08:36 - big things that I would say that you
08:38 - really need to get going is get a demo
08:40 - out and the earlier the possible to get
08:43 - that demo out because you need those
08:44 - streamers to play it not at launch not
08:45 - when you're launching your game you want
08:47 - those streamers to play it nice and
08:49 - early because that'll increase your wish
08:51 - list influx you'll also have more
08:53 - chances at getting into festivals and a
08:55 - lot of streamers look at festivals for
08:57 - finding games that they play on stream
08:59 - so the combination of those two is
09:02 - really how most games get their
09:04 - visibility and take off that is what it
09:06 - takes to Market your game on Steam so
09:08 - Hugo I'm I'm here to answer any
09:10 - questions you might have all right yeah
09:12 - that was awesome that was a great high
09:14 - level overview of how marketing Works
09:15 - how I mean marketing is really basically
09:17 - just the study of attention how to get
09:19 - people to pay attention to your game
09:20 - because basically what I always say is
09:22 - it makes no sense to spend so much
09:24 - effort on your game and spend no effort
09:26 - on actually trying to Market it so I
09:28 - feel that is especially nowadays with so
09:30 - much uh so many games coming out
09:31 - everything is so crowded if you're going
09:33 - to put in so much effort into making
09:34 - something really special then I think it
09:35 - also makes sense put in a ton of effort
09:37 - making people actually know that your
09:39 - awesome thing exists all right so yeah I
09:41 - definitely do have a bunch of awesome
09:43 - questions and it's awesome how you
09:44 - mention a bunch of things like festivals
09:46 - and demos I definitely want to get to
09:48 - those but before let's actually start
09:49 - off with the simplest one of all which
09:51 - is how many wish lists should I have
09:52 - before
09:53 - release yeah minimum absolutely minimum
09:57 - I say is 7,000 and the reason I say this
10:00 - is the way steam's visibility algorithms
10:03 - work all these algorithms is it's kind
10:06 - of like a ladder if each step gets you
10:10 - enough visibility to qualify you for the
10:12 - next step and the next step and the next
10:14 - step and the way the team works just by
10:16 - happen stance their first kind of rung
10:19 - in that ladder is what we call uh
10:22 - popular upcoming so about a week before
10:24 - you release steam looks at all the games
10:26 - that have somewhere around 7,000 I've
10:28 - seen some games games get in with 5,000
10:30 - it depends on how many other games
10:31 - they're launching some games with 6,000
10:33 - and if they see they just pull that list
10:35 - they say one week out the algorithm just
10:37 - goes out oh these are all the games that
10:38 - have 6,000 7,000 wish list thereabouts
10:41 - here let's put them in a list and they
10:42 - just rank you based on your exact time
10:44 - that you release so if you say 12:01 a
10:47 - on this day well you're going to be at
10:48 - the top of the list and then it it goes
10:50 - down from that so that list there's 10
10:52 - games in that popular upcoming and they
10:55 - show up and then as new games are
10:57 - reaching after new G release they pop
11:00 - off the list and the next game in the
11:02 - list pops up so it just is a constant
11:04 - flowing list of games in that popular
11:06 - upcoming and it gives you a ton of
11:08 - visibility uh by a lot of measures we
11:10 - see that games that are on there get
11:11 - about a thousand wish lists a day and so
11:13 - if you time it right you can end up in
11:15 - there four days five days if you play
11:17 - the game right um so then that's the
11:20 - week just before launch and then from
11:22 - there if you convert those wish list and
11:24 - a lot of people buy the next step on the
11:25 - ladder is what we call new and trending
11:27 - and so you have to sell a bunch of game
11:30 - sell a bunch of copies within a short
11:32 - period of time just based on the
11:33 - research that I've done it's about
11:35 - selling
11:36 - $8,000 gross revenue this is the pre-
11:39 - steam cut pre-tax is just raw $88,000
11:42 - earned that's usually pretty competitive
11:45 - to end up on new and trending and just
11:47 - like popular on upcoming your game just
11:49 - stays on there until more games pop it
11:51 - off you know as games release and sell
11:54 - $8,000 within a short period of time
11:56 - they start bumping you off um and you
11:58 - just stay on there there and so that
12:00 - combo those are the first two steps of
12:01 - the ladder and there's other things like
12:03 - um Discovery que that if you convert
12:06 - well and you have a ton of visibility
12:09 - they will give you a spot in this widget
12:10 - called Discovery queue so those
12:12 - combination of those three kind of are
12:14 - the start of the visibility ramp on
12:18 - Steam on once you launch your game now
12:20 - if you miss that like you don't get that
12:22 - 7,000 then it just it's really hard to
12:25 - climb that ladder so if you don't get
12:26 - enough wish list at that time you're not
12:28 - on popular upcoming and then it's really
12:31 - hard to get those you know those last
12:32 - minute wish lists those 1,000 per day
12:34 - you don't get those and then it's hard
12:36 - to convert enough of those wish lists
12:37 - show up on new and trending so you see
12:39 - you can just see the ladder start just
12:41 - going away if you don't start making
12:43 - those steps up the ladder so that's why
12:45 - I say
12:46 - 7,000 minimum to get in there now yeah
12:50 - so that number is not not necessarily
12:52 - set in stone right it's uh like you were
12:54 - saying it depends on what other games
12:56 - are coming out around that time so it
12:57 - might be 7,000 5,000 so B there's no
13:00 - magic number written directly in the
13:01 - algorithm saying if above 7,000 go here
13:03 - if not go there yeah and it's it's a
13:06 - little bit wobbly so one thing that I
13:08 - like to to recommend people is look at
13:10 - your game go to steamdb on your on your
13:12 - game um and you'll see a ranking if if
13:15 - you're ranked and usually the ranking
13:17 - happens right around 7,000 wish list see
13:19 - it's all relative to all the other games
13:21 - on Steam what steam's actually doing is
13:24 - they're just pulling the most wishlisted
13:27 - games that release that that week okay
13:30 - and so when you look on
13:32 - steamdb if you have enough wish list
13:34 - right around 5,000 7,000 it'll say rank
13:36 - number and it'll say like you are number
13:38 - 5,000 in wish list that means of all the
13:41 - games on Steam and it's usually like the
13:43 - first 2,000 is when you get the number
13:45 - assigned to you because there's so many
13:46 - games on Steam that the top 2,000 games
13:49 - that have not yet released get a rank
13:51 - number if you have a rank number that
13:53 - means you're a pretty good shot of
13:54 - getting on uh new and trending or
13:56 - popular upcoming I should say popular
13:58 - upcoming because I think the algorithm
14:00 - actually just says how many games show
14:03 - me all the ranked games that have a
14:05 - release date within the next week that's
14:07 - I think what the algorithm does so
14:08 - sometimes if there aren't a lot of games
14:10 - that are out there you can get in that
14:13 - ranked number with fewer wishless that's
14:15 - the kind of why we're saying there's no
14:17 - full number it's kind of like you're
14:19 - everybody's running in a race together
14:21 - and they just pick the top front of that
14:23 - race all right yeah so so yeah basically
14:26 - roughly have 7,000 in order to get on
14:28 - that basically start the ball rolling
14:30 - and then steam basically you got to kick
14:32 - off the steam algorithm and once it
14:34 - starts then it starts basically working
14:35 - for you but you have to first get that
14:37 - initial thing so yeah that's a a great
14:39 - one let me just put one more let me just
14:42 - say one more caveat to that now this is
14:44 - one thing that I often hear because I
14:45 - talked to a lot of Indies so I hear a
14:46 - lot of the comments some people might
14:48 - say well I heard about 30,000 wish list
14:50 - or 50,000 wish list some people say that
14:53 - now what this is coming from is
14:55 - typically Publishers if you sign with a
14:58 - publisher your publisher really wants
15:00 - you to get to 30,000 or 50,000 somewhere
15:03 - in that range depending on the publisher
15:05 - the reason that is is because remember I
15:07 - said there was that new and trending
15:08 - where you have to get $8,000 within like
15:10 - the first 24 hours like within a short
15:12 - period of time well Publishers have been
15:15 - around enough and they know that to get
15:17 - to 8,000 sales your wish lists have to
15:20 - convert enough wish list have to convert
15:22 - and they want that kind of buffer so if
15:24 - you're con you could convert at 20% like
15:26 - all your wish lists convert at 20% 20%
15:28 - of all the wish lists you earned convert
15:30 - that's awesome but some games have a
15:32 - little softer they only convert at like
15:34 - 5% or 1% I've seen games that do all
15:36 - those range anywhere between 1 to 30%
15:39 - I've seen and so if it turns out by
15:42 - whatever Factor your game is a low
15:44 - converter like 1,000 when you have
15:46 - 30,000 or 50,000 wish list that just
15:49 - gives you a a bigger margin of error so
15:52 - that those 1% of 30,000 will give you
15:55 - enough sales to get you into new and
15:57 - trending so see there's no line in the
16:00 - algorithm says if you do this you do
16:02 - that it's more they just kind of look at
16:04 - conversion rates and that because um uh
16:08 - it really just you need that buffer to
16:10 - earn that money and that's why
16:12 - Publishers will say oh you need 50,000
16:14 - or 30,000 not because that's a solid
16:16 - number in the algorithm just because
16:18 - that is more likely to give you enough
16:20 - sales and enough dollar earned to rank
16:23 - on new and trending so it's complicated
16:26 - but it's
16:27 - not yeah yeah I mean that's uh great uh
16:31 - extra information yeah definitely uh
16:33 - basically the idea of a buffer zone and
16:35 - conversion rate yeah that is definitely
16:36 - also important uh so yeah second very
16:38 - important question when should I start
16:40 - marketing my game yeah I personally like
16:44 - to do it IM mediately so what as soon as
16:47 - I've got a game idea or need to have
16:49 - something visible here's here's what I
16:51 - recommend is I've got uh three sometimes
16:54 - four depending on if I ate breakfast
16:56 - that day uh recommendations of when
16:57 - you're ready for to start marketing your
16:59 - game um and by marketing your game I'm
17:02 - specifically talking about putting up a
17:04 - steam page that says wish list now and
17:06 - here's kind of my rules one you
17:08 - definitely know what type of game it is
17:10 - you're like you know sometimes maybe
17:11 - you're like well maybe it's going to be
17:12 - an action RPG maybe it's going to be a
17:14 - Rog likee maybe it's just going to be a
17:17 - linear narrative game you know all of
17:19 - those could be like a 2d game or a
17:21 - Metroid Vania or a Rog like action Rog
17:23 - like once you know sometimes that kind
17:25 - of changes during development when you
17:27 - are sure you're like this is definitely
17:29 - a Metroid Vania there's no doubt about
17:30 - it I'm making a Metroid Vania that's
17:33 - first step second step is your graphic
17:36 - style has to be decided and by decided I
17:39 - mean you know like oh we're definitely
17:41 - going cartoony we're going to look it's
17:43 - going to have big Blobby features you
17:45 - know all that kind of stuff or you're
17:45 - like I'm going to go Grim dark
17:47 - everything's going to be black and white
17:48 - and covered in blood whatever it is
17:50 - you've picked the actual art style that
17:53 - you're going to go with okay third thing
17:55 - you need is I recommend four different
17:58 - environments four different biomes four
18:00 - different you know just scenes so that
18:02 - it looks unique the main thing that I
18:03 - see that the problem that Indies when
18:05 - they first throw up their first steam
18:06 - page is I can tell you made one
18:08 - environment and you just shifted the
18:09 - camera around and I could see everything
18:11 - in the background's the same you know
18:13 - like there's a tower in the back and I
18:15 - can tell in one screenshot the tower's
18:16 - over here then the same Tower's over
18:18 - here then the tow is here I can tell you
18:20 - just kind of like Pan the camera around
18:22 - the same one office or the one you know
18:24 - like level area that's not going to cut
18:27 - it with steam you need different
18:28 - environments different levels like snow
18:30 - biome uh fire biome uh you know the
18:34 - forest you want different things now I
18:36 - know you're still in development you can
18:38 - mock this up they're just screenshots um
18:40 - so I recommend you you know you just
18:43 - make the art in the right art style and
18:46 - you stage it up like in unity or
18:48 - whatever you're using so it looks like a
18:50 - different scene it doesn't have to
18:51 - function if it could be like I just run
18:53 - through the tree and there no it just
18:55 - doesn't clip or you know the enemies are
18:57 - just like still they're posed it's like
19:00 - it's just a screenshot they we they
19:01 - don't need to know that there's no AI or
19:03 - the thing's not coded you just have to
19:05 - Stage it don't lie but just stage it so
19:08 - it looks unique and then from there the
19:11 - last thing that I always recommend is a
19:12 - trailer you really should have a trailer
19:14 - because it means you're serious the
19:16 - other reason I say you need a trailer
19:18 - when you kind of do this announce is a
19:21 - big marketing beat remember how I said
19:23 - you need external people streamers
19:26 - Festival goers sometimes the Press
19:29 - YouTubers a big marketing beat when you
19:32 - kick off your game is your announce
19:34 - trailer so you make a trailer you title
19:36 - it announce trailer and you put it out
19:39 - there and you reach out to like IGN and
19:42 - streamers and and the press and say
19:44 - Here's my announce trailer just saying
19:46 - announce trailer makes people stand up
19:48 - and go I must cover this game so that's
19:51 - why I say you should also have a trailer
19:52 - so those four things a known genre you
19:55 - know what your genre is you know what
19:57 - the art style is you've made enough
19:59 - screenshots for four environments and
20:01 - you have a trailer those are the four
20:03 - things to actually start marketing your
20:06 - game okay that's that's interesting so
20:08 - so basically you you would say it's not
20:10 - necessarily recommended to just
20:12 - basically have just screenshots no Trail
20:14 - just a rough idea just you know what the
20:16 - game is going to be but you haven't yet
20:18 - made a nice polished trailer so you
20:19 - would say better to wait for it and
20:21 - really kick off with a like you said a
20:23 - nice marketing beat as opposed to just
20:25 - just make this coming soon Page live you
20:28 - would say wait for a proper marketing
20:30 - beat yes don't just fart your page out
20:33 - there don't just like n it's a Thursday
20:35 - I'm going to put it live do it no it has
20:37 - to be a big moment so you start working
20:41 - with uh either content creators like on
20:44 - Tik Tok or maybe you reach out to IGN
20:46 - find IGN say we have a secret trailer we
20:49 - are getting ready to announce our game
20:50 - do you want to have exclusive access and
20:52 - you send them their trailer and they're
20:53 - like this trailer is good like you do
20:55 - this like a month before you're going to
20:57 - announce or or you know how I said those
20:59 - festivals you reach out to the festival
21:01 - organizers you look at my website how
21:03 - tomarket game.com festivals is the
21:06 - festival list you look at that festival
21:08 - list and you see what's coming up and
21:10 - you start applying to festivals even
21:11 - though you don't have a steam page yet
21:12 - with your trailer and you say we're
21:14 - getting ready to announce this game can
21:16 - we get into the TR into your Festival
21:18 - you would get the announce of our game
21:21 - in your festival and then the organizers
21:22 - are like we get this special moment
21:24 - where we to announce this person's game
21:26 - we're definitely going to feature them
21:28 - in the thing so again you see how you're
21:29 - using the fact that you nobody's heard
21:32 - about you and then all of a sudden
21:33 - something will be heard as a special
21:35 - ticket and you're you're going around to
21:37 - a bunch of people and saying do you want
21:38 - to cash this ticket you get to cash it
21:40 - who wants to cash it and then somebody
21:42 - says I do if you just fart your page out
21:45 - you just put it up for no reason you
21:46 - don't have a trailer you just took that
21:48 - ticket and you just crumpled it up and
21:49 - threw it on the ground you know what I
21:51 - mean so use that ticket it's given to
21:54 - you okay so yeah so basically the
21:56 - announcement should be a nice important
21:58 - thing to kick things off nicely uh so
22:00 - yeah I mean you spoke about Festival so
22:02 - just a quick question should you
22:03 - participate in a steam Festival I mean
22:05 - nowadays things are quite a bit more
22:06 - crud but do you still think it's a good
22:09 - idea and basically when should you
22:10 - participate yeah so there's several
22:13 - types of festivals and I'll just qu
22:15 - clarify this the big big one is Steam
22:18 - nextfest and and there's nothing special
22:20 - about steam nextfest it's actually very
22:22 - crowded right now the main reason people
22:24 - always talk about steam nextfest is it's
22:26 - one that you everybody's guaranteed
22:28 - every everybody who has a steam page can
22:31 - do one and only one steam next test and
22:34 - you get to choose when you want to do it
22:36 - it's like having one bullet that you get
22:38 - to fire everybody gets to fire their one
22:40 - bullet but you can only do it February
22:43 - October and June I don't know why I did
22:46 - them in that order but that's that's not
22:47 - the order but there's three of them per
22:49 - year February June October those are the
22:52 - three dayses and so you get to pick
22:54 - which one of those three you want to do
22:55 - now um it is crowded definitely is and I
22:59 - just published a blog post if you go to
23:00 - how tomarket game.com blog you can see
23:02 - my latest one it's about um ziv Nelson
23:05 - Jr and what they did was they basically
23:08 - said we're going to do our steam next
23:10 - test right off that and what they did
23:12 - was they knew they were getting a huge
23:13 - Boost from being in a game show like
23:15 - Jeff Key's festival and they just paired
23:17 - it with steam nextfest see because he
23:19 - knows when he can fire that bullet he
23:21 - said I'm gonna I'm going to use it
23:23 - strategically and use my one time to
23:25 - pair it with this big Festival announce
23:27 - and he announced this game so he was
23:28 - basically firing three bullets at the
23:30 - same time all the other festivals that I
23:33 - list at how tomarket game.com
23:36 - festivals all those festivals are just
23:40 - random you don't know if you're going to
23:41 - get to them you apply and you get in
23:44 - they might like your game they might not
23:46 - so that's why we spend extra time
23:48 - talking about steam nextfest but all the
23:50 - other festivals change sometimes the
23:53 - festivals have nobody else in them it's
23:55 - like 50 games get in it's a very
23:57 - exclusive Festival some games is like
23:58 - everybody gets in it's like there's
24:00 - 2,000 games in the festival it just
24:02 - depends and there's also themed
24:04 - festivals there's like cozy games and if
24:06 - you're in a cozy game it's usually
24:08 - smaller and the audience is like very
24:10 - dedicated they love every cozy game they
24:12 - wish list every single one they buy
24:13 - every single one there's like narrative
24:15 - game festivals like n Ludo naron if
24:19 - you're writing a a um Adventure game or
24:21 - a visual novel those do very well
24:24 - because again that audience is very
24:25 - tuned in but if it's a general Festival
24:27 - like I don't know action games H that's
24:30 - so Broad and there's so many different
24:32 - types of people that those don't convert
24:33 - as well but here's the thing I still
24:35 - even if the W Festival only got you a
24:37 - 100 wish lists and they convert poorly
24:40 - hey that's 100 wish lists and a poorly
24:42 - converting wish list that you didn't
24:43 - have at the beginning there's no
24:44 - downside to participating in a festival
24:47 - other than maybe the time to kind of
24:49 - like manage you know the upload and
24:52 - applying and maybe if you did a custom
24:55 - demo for them um some of them do have a
24:57 - little bit of a cost it's usually not
24:59 - too much it's usually like in hundred to
25:02 - ,000 but the visibility they give you is
25:04 - very good so anywhere in that range
25:07 - there's really no big downside to a
25:09 - participating in a Fest okay yeah
25:12 - festivals do seem to be a big part of
25:14 - marketing games nowadays so yeah that
25:15 - was definitely very helpful now one
25:17 - question that I really want to ask you
25:18 - which is actually something that I saw
25:20 - on a blog post that you made uh quite a
25:22 - while ago is how how uh basically it was
25:25 - a graph of how many games a studio makes
25:27 - and how like so many studios make one
25:29 - game very few Studios make the second
25:31 - third and so on so basically my question
25:33 - is would you recommend someone spends
25:35 - let's say five years working on just one
25:36 - game trying to make like one huge
25:38 - Masterpiece or in those same five years
25:40 - make five different games which one
25:41 - would you recommend you go you you're
25:44 - man at my heart okay so I my basic
25:47 - complaint for all Indies out there is
25:49 - that you spend way too long working on
25:51 - your first game or any game um and I
25:54 - know it sounds easy it's easy for me
25:55 - just to say you spending too long on it
25:57 - um what we found was
25:58 - about 75% of Studios will release one
26:01 - game and then nothing else I don't know
26:04 - what happens to them some of them go off
26:06 - and make a second Studio or something
26:08 - but this is data that I scrape from
26:09 - stream the number of Studios who have
26:11 - released two games is very very small
26:14 - after that it's like 7,000 so I think
26:16 - it's like um you know down to like 10%
26:20 - of Studios will actually make two games
26:22 - and then it goes down even further like
26:24 - 0 1% or something release three games uh
26:28 - just even further and further um but
26:31 - here's the thing most of your success
26:33 - happens in your second and your third
26:34 - and your fourth because games roll
26:37 - forward so even if your first game
26:39 - didn't do very well there's still a lot
26:41 - of people who bought it who are
26:42 - wishlisting it and there's some people
26:44 - that love you they like man this is my
26:46 - one of my favorite games I know it
26:48 - didn't sell well but I love this game so
26:49 - what you do is you take this audience
26:51 - because every day your game is on sto on
26:54 - the store getting viewed by people when
26:56 - you release even if it wasn't a big
26:57 - seller still getting views and when you
26:59 - release your second game you take that
27:02 - that audience and you put it on there
27:03 - and then all of a sudden your second
27:04 - game is starting at about here and then
27:06 - you're building on top of that and then
27:07 - it's a third game and the fourth game
27:09 - and so they just stack and I find that
27:13 - most success comes fourth fifth game now
27:16 - knowing that this should change your
27:18 - strategy if you were thinking I'm going
27:20 - to make the perfect game my first game
27:23 - you will never finish it or you're just
27:25 - going to die basically so what I
27:27 - recommend is don't make your dream game
27:29 - your first game just don't I know a lot
27:30 - of people I get a lot of emails I'm
27:32 - working on my dream game this is my I've
27:34 - always wanted to make this game I say I
27:36 - know it's hard but tuck it away you're
27:39 - not ready for your first game okay you
27:41 - got to make smaller first games that hey
27:45 - you you like you're interested in but
27:47 - they're not your dream game and so what
27:50 - you do is you level up and you grow an
27:53 - ability to get to your dream game like
27:56 - your fourth or fifth release and then
27:58 - you've got a lot of codebase you know
28:00 - how to make games you know like every
28:02 - game has a setting screen work on your
28:04 - setting screen your first game and then
28:05 - just use the same setting screen
28:06 - basically for all your future games
28:07 - saves you Dev time um all that kind of
28:10 - stuff and your audience will grow over
28:12 - time it's just so much it is impossible
28:16 - to have your first game succeed and even
28:18 - if you're like well what about this game
28:20 - most of the time if you look back
28:22 - they've been releasing games for decades
28:24 - it is very very very hard to make your
28:27 - first game of success so with that in
28:29 - mind structure your studio structure
28:31 - your Dev time to release a lot of small
28:33 - games and each one gets a little bit
28:34 - bigger until you get to your dream game
28:37 - okay that's my recommendation for Indies
28:39 - out there yeah that's awesome I mean
28:41 - what you're saying really resonates with
28:42 - me because I definitely do believe in
28:44 - the same way make multiple games as
28:46 - opposed to just one huge game and
28:47 - specifically what you mentioned about
28:49 - reusing things I mean for me something
28:50 - that I always talk about my channel is
28:51 - all about writing good clean code so
28:53 - that you can reuse it on many things
28:55 - like for example I've got my animation
28:56 - system that I made and reused in like
28:58 - four or five games so yeah that is
29:00 - definitely something that I very much
29:02 - believe in yeah and I do think that is
29:03 - the best approach okay so a bit of a
29:06 - potentially similar question so what are
29:08 - the best genres on Steam I mean I know
29:10 - steam is huge but should I make a cozy
29:12 - game should I make a dark and Moody game
29:14 - should I make a survival crafting game a
29:16 - city Builder what what does the team
29:18 - audience generally
29:20 - prefer okay I'm gonna kind of pair these
29:23 - with the previous one because I say hey
29:25 - make small games just make a quick small
29:26 - game and then he's like what the hell I
29:29 - I can't make a small game what you want
29:30 - me to Crunch no you pick genres that are
29:33 - smaller okay so your first game I'm
29:35 - sorry folks should not be an RPG because
29:38 - there's those games just have so much
29:40 - content they're so deep you just won't
29:44 - be able to finish it in time I'm sorry
29:46 - you just can't okay um and so what you
29:49 - do is in the interest of building up a
29:54 - code base and learning how games are
29:56 - designed because that's a big thing too
29:57 - just just knowing the design of games
29:59 - like what how hard should the game be
30:01 - what's how do you tutorial lifee that's
30:03 - all things you have to learn by making
30:04 - games so there are some genres that are
30:07 - pretty simple to make um are they do
30:11 - very well on Steam relatively and they
30:14 - give you that kind of experience and
30:15 - they could build up to the final game
30:17 - because really like if you think about
30:19 - it an RPG is really a lot of genres
30:22 - stacked together it's like you know
30:24 - you've got experience like incremental
30:27 - experience and spending it on upgrades
30:30 - you've got a narrative just typing the
30:33 - story you know writing out a story as a
30:35 - game you've got um kind of the battle
30:37 - whatever your battle whether it's real
30:38 - time or you know turn-based you've got a
30:42 - battle system you have like an
30:43 - exploration where you're like exploring
30:45 - the Overworld so that's like four or
30:47 - five games just for an RPG this is why
30:49 - you should not make an RPG for your
30:50 - first game because it's actually like
30:52 - six games duct taped together and
30:55 - present it to you so what I recommend is
30:57 - there is I study the market all the time
30:59 - and that's what I write about hard to
31:00 - Market game.com free is how to sign up
31:02 - for that but um all those genres um
31:05 - there are a lot of genres that are very
31:07 - small and actually are pieces that show
31:09 - up in like an RPG or some other genres
31:12 - and I'll let me list them out real quick
31:14 - so the small genres that I recommend
31:16 - Indies start out with is one like an
31:18 - incremental like an increment idle game
31:21 - sometimes call those do very well on
31:23 - Steam now you might say oh there's so
31:25 - many garbage ones if they're good they
31:26 - go up and I know banana yeah yeah yeah
31:28 - but um it's there's other ones that I'd
31:30 - recommend that you check out like chill
31:32 - quarium is one um micro civilization is
31:36 - another one Loi beats I think it's
31:39 - called Loi beats uh yeah the one that is
31:42 - the something like that yeah yeah it's
31:46 - it's it it's not actually ly girl I
31:48 - think she's featured in there um but
31:49 - it's an incremental game where if you
31:51 - just idle if you just concentrate you do
31:53 - work your numbers tick up and then you
31:55 - can buy upgrades for your thing those
31:57 - are those Idol games research that genre
32:00 - look at the top sellers if you do them
32:01 - right very Pro very um very positive
32:05 - effect oh another one is Rusty's
32:06 - retirement but the good thing about
32:08 - those increments is they teach you how
32:11 - XP grows how to buy upgrades in an
32:14 - interesting way because you need to do
32:16 - the loop interesting so it's a very
32:18 - self-contained small game that teaches
32:20 - you the fundamentals and doesn't take as
32:22 - long as a big RPG that's your dream game
32:24 - but a lot of the code that you use in
32:27 - your increment can be adapted for your
32:31 - RPG down the line and so you might learn
32:33 - like your first incremental game people
32:34 - like God this game sucks it's it's too
32:37 - slow and you're like oh okay I got to
32:38 - tune this up so you learn in your second
32:41 - game maybe make a second idler and
32:42 - you're like oh I changed the progression
32:44 - so that you earn xp faster oh man and
32:47 - people like that's great you did it good
32:48 - job then you take those Lessons Learned
32:50 - and you apply it to your RPG dream game
32:52 - later on that's just an example another
32:54 - genre that's really big are um Auto
32:56 - Battlers you B basically upgrade a bunch
32:58 - of little units and you say go get them
33:00 - and then you just you don't control it
33:02 - you just push a button that says go and
33:04 - then they those little units that you've
33:05 - upgraded go and they attack some
33:06 - monsters and there's some number system
33:08 - that determines who's the winner that's
33:10 - an auto battler very hot genre again you
33:13 - can do it in small bits and it's like a
33:15 - piece of an RPG remember how we talked
33:17 - about battle systems the lessons that
33:19 - you learn building an auto battler can
33:20 - be applied to an RPG third one narrative
33:24 - games are hard but there are a couple
33:26 - genres that actually do pretty well one
33:28 - is a horror game now most of the time I
33:31 - say that your game has to be deep and
33:32 - systematic horror games are games that
33:36 - should be um very small like two hours
33:39 - Max and it's usually just a camera
33:41 - rolling around in a spooky dungeon or
33:44 - something and there's some monster
33:45 - chasing you it's a great way to learn
33:46 - animation just how to work a camera
33:48 - system a little bit of narrative like
33:50 - they click something and it tells a
33:52 - little story on there but it's like dark
33:54 - and brooding those are excellent games f
33:57 - Master development time and people love
33:59 - horror games especially if your
34:00 - Monster's really gross and like their
34:02 - head is sideways or they're a girl
34:04 - dressed in white and she has black eyes
34:06 - and she screams at you people people
34:08 - love those that's like an instant like
34:10 - uh good way to do a horror game um I
34:13 - know I'm seeing it sounds fake and
34:15 - cynical but this is what the steam
34:16 - audience wants are those type of games
34:18 - um and the other genres that uh do
34:21 - pretty well that are pretty uh good is
34:24 - one is um what I call they don't really
34:26 - have a genre they're called like the St
34:27 - stacking games and there these little
34:28 - cards stack lands is one uh the one that
34:32 - invented it is called cultist simulator
34:34 - look those up and they're basically
34:36 - games where you take cards and you stack
34:38 - these cards and the way you stack them
34:40 - kind of as like building a a city or
34:42 - it's like your your crafting things
34:45 - again this is code that you learn here
34:46 - that can be applied to a bigger game so
34:48 - these are all genres that are very good
34:51 - and I recommend um stay away from
34:53 - Platformers Platformers just don't sell
34:56 - very well especially PL puzzle
34:58 - Platformers those sell very very poorly
35:01 - um and I for some reason Indies think
35:03 - that that's their first I don't know
35:04 - where that message got out but they just
35:06 - sell so poorly because people don't like
35:09 - getting stuck in puzzle games and so
35:11 - really watch out for those I know you're
35:13 - probably watching this and you're like I
35:14 - just making a puzzle platformer I know
35:17 - it's hard I made I made some my first
35:18 - games were puzzle platforms they didn't
35:19 - sell well it's just the nature of it
35:21 - people just don't like them on Steam
35:23 - those previous genres that I I mentioned
35:25 - do much better so if you're making a
35:26 - puzzle platform just don't throw it away
35:28 - don't blow up your computer just put a
35:31 - just like do a do your last commit start
35:34 - a new one you know if you're like man I
35:36 - worked three years on this thing I'm so
35:37 - sick of it hey just put it aside take a
35:39 - little vacation from your game and and
35:42 - make an idler or something they they're
35:44 - just so much more popular I see it it's
35:46 - like night and day popularity between
35:48 - those games and and you're going to love
35:49 - Game Dev again if you start making a
35:51 - genre that Ste Lov yeah I was going to
35:53 - say my my next question was going to be
35:55 - so many Indies start with Platformers so
35:57 - should I do a platformer so apparently
35:59 - the answer is no but yeah a lot of a lot
36:01 - of Indies definitely do start start with
36:03 - that and yeah it's a very tricky and
36:05 - another thing that I've al already heard
36:07 - you say several times is how horror is
36:09 - supposedly a great genre because it's
36:10 - very simple to make something and it
36:12 - really just needs something a little bit
36:14 - interesting as long as it has a little
36:16 - hook something that is slightly
36:18 - different it doesn't have to be super
36:19 - complex and yeah definitely personally I
36:22 - have to say for me horror is not the
36:24 - kind of games that I don't like to play
36:25 - I get scared way too easily but you your
36:28 - uh comments on the genre definitely made
36:30 - me slightly convinced that I should
36:32 - probably give it a try because yeah it
36:34 - seems like a seems like can be a good
36:36 - genre here here's here's one thing a lot
36:39 - of people wonder about I don't like
36:40 - horror horror sells so well so well and
36:44 - you don't even have to be a fan to make
36:47 - a horror game and let me let me explain
36:49 - um I'm I'm a big film buff I love movies
36:51 - I'm always I'm always reading about film
36:53 - and stuff like that um I love movies um
36:57 - one of the best horror films ever made
37:00 - The Shining made by Stanley cubrick that
37:03 - guy didn't even like horror movies he
37:06 - only made The Shining because his
37:07 - previous movie that he made was a total
37:09 - flop nobody liked it he's like God these
37:11 - horror movies are always hits I need a
37:15 - hit I'm gonna make the best horror movie
37:17 - ever I don't even like him and so he
37:18 - read all these horror books and he's
37:20 - like I hate this book I hate this book
37:21 - and then he found The Shining he's like
37:22 - this is a good story and he decided to
37:25 - make The Shining this classic horror
37:28 - film just because he wanted a hit and
37:31 - like this is very similar to Indies
37:32 - they're like I'm sick of making these
37:33 - puzzle Platformers that never sell I'm
37:35 - sick of it fine I'm just gonna make a
37:36 - horror game and they do amazingly well
37:39 - you don't have to be like the biggest
37:41 - horror fan but one thing I do recommend
37:43 - is play a couple horror games I know it
37:46 - might be scary but put on your designer
37:47 - hat like I'm not scared I'm just
37:49 - investigating the design and look at
37:51 - really how horror games are built like
37:54 - why they work now I know a lot of Indies
37:56 - they try and make a horror game but they
37:57 - like bring in this like game designer
37:59 - brain where they're like well it's not
38:00 - actually a horror game it's more of a
38:02 - card battler where your systems are the
38:05 - horror and and they add all these extra
38:07 - systems no no no no no just make it a
38:09 - straightup horror game where it's like
38:11 - I'm just a dude running through some
38:13 - dark corridors and there's a girl
38:15 - dressed all in White and her eyes are
38:16 - black and like bleeding and she screams
38:18 - at me like just make a freaking horror
38:21 - game that's like a real horror game
38:22 - don't try and like over complicate it
38:24 - with all these game Design Systems that
38:26 - don't belong in a horror game it just
38:27 - got to be scary just make it
38:31 - scary okay yeah maybe I should try that
38:34 - uh okay so yeah in terms of uh let's say
38:37 - that I'm prototyping I'm trying to
38:38 - figure out so I'm trying to follow your
38:39 - guide on uh trying to choose a genre
38:42 - that is good for Steam and trying to
38:44 - wait a little bit before making my Big
38:45 - Marketing push announcing the game so in
38:47 - between that point in between making a
38:49 - prototype until I'm sure that I know my
38:51 - idea how should I validate that idea
38:53 - should I like post gifts on Twitter
38:55 - something like that how do I how do I
38:56 - test do I know okay this genre this idea
38:59 - is potentially viable so I'm going to
39:01 - push through it yeah yeah so what I um
39:04 - uh search on my blog hadark game.com um
39:06 - search genre I've done a lot of genre
39:09 - reports um also um because we're doing
39:12 - this as part of the summer sale if you
39:14 - click the link down below I do this
39:15 - every year I do this uh lecture Series
39:19 - where I look at the previous year and I
39:21 - look at the genres that are hot and I
39:22 - track it every time because one thing
39:24 - any time I talk about a genre that's hot
39:25 - people are like well it's hot this year
39:27 - was it hot last year what's changing it
39:29 - doesn't change that much that's that's a
39:31 - big myth that a lot of Indies fall for
39:33 - they get too scared of they think oh
39:35 - well the genres change so fast they
39:36 - don't actually change too fast because
39:38 - the biggest genres are strategy games um
39:41 - horror games Civilization like forx
39:43 - style games firstperson Shooters those
39:46 - genres have been popular since way back
39:47 - in my when I was like 16 years old city
39:50 - I used to play so many city builders
39:51 - strategy games and first-person shooters
39:53 - guess what they're still hot um but
39:56 - anyway so I talk about um in that in
39:59 - that class it's called game marketing
40:00 - ideas you'll see the last two years of
40:03 - lectures where I go by straight down the
40:05 - line of what genres are selling on Steam
40:07 - so that's one resource and and Hugo you
40:10 - and I have collaborated if you buy it
40:12 - Hugo gets a nice little um present for
40:14 - for helping do that so you're supporting
40:16 - Hugo by doing by picking up game
40:17 - marketing ideas um but in general it's
40:22 - it's hard and this is why I do what I do
40:24 - it's it's hard you can you can kind of
40:25 - lie to yourself that a genre is hot when
40:28 - you look at the data because you'll find
40:30 - one that succeeds and what I really try
40:32 - and do and it's I I try and look at the
40:34 - medians of several genres and compare
40:36 - them and I look across so many different
40:38 - things like um streamers so it's it is
40:41 - you can do it I just recommend that you
40:43 - don't look at just the winners because
40:45 - every genre has one game that succeeds
40:48 - the difference is genres have a huge
40:51 - range of sales some sell very well some
40:53 - don't and so what I recommend is really
40:55 - looking across the time and that's kind
40:57 - of why I I do the writing so if you
40:59 - search my blog for genre you'll see what
41:01 - I recommend of the top genres and then
41:02 - from within that data that I've
41:04 - presented you can kind of pick games
41:06 - that are um the games that speak to you
41:09 - because this is games it should still be
41:10 - fun for you so if there's genres that
41:12 - you just absolutely absolutely don't
41:14 - like or actually are like kind of
41:15 - interested in you're like oh yeah that
41:16 - does sound interesting then you can try
41:18 - those and see if you actually they make
41:20 - a good fit for you so that's kind of how
41:22 - I'd recommend picking a game now to your
41:24 - question Hugo about how do you validate
41:27 - one way to validate yes is share it on
41:29 - Twitter like say hey here here's my
41:31 - monster and show a picture of your
41:32 - monster and see what it is um you can do
41:34 - the trailer but here's the problem is
41:37 - for the most part 99% of games don't
41:40 - impress just with their visuals most of
41:42 - them impress with their gameplay so it's
41:45 - kind of a hard thing I recommend you
41:47 - make a demo much earlier than most
41:50 - people expect so you try with some
41:52 - screenshots and some video uh you know
41:55 - of the game being played most of the
41:57 - time you won't get any good data out of
41:58 - that because it has to be a very very
42:01 - very goodlooking game to go viral on
42:03 - social media it's not until people play
42:05 - it and you give it to streamers and you
42:07 - enter into festivals with that demo do
42:08 - you start to see oh yeah this is getting
42:10 - some numbers I've seen a lot of games
42:11 - that did poorly on Twitter but as soon
42:13 - as they put out the the demo it the the
42:16 - the wish list skyrocketed and everybody
42:17 - loved the game so it's hard to do that
42:20 - early validation and not convince
42:23 - yourself it's a bad idea it's it's hard
42:25 - so I would just recommend make a lot of
42:27 - games make them quickly and learn that
42:30 - way interesting yeah I mean play testing
42:32 - is extremely important I mean at the end
42:34 - of the day we're making games so yeah if
42:36 - the game looks great but doesn't play
42:37 - great then it's not very it's not a very
42:39 - good game so yeah focusing on the play
42:41 - test making sure that the game design
42:42 - actually works yeah that is definitely
42:44 - very important so let's say that I've
42:46 - published my game or I'm about to
42:47 - publish my game should I go with Early
42:50 - Access or not or are there specific
42:52 - genres that should go into Early Access
42:53 - and some that
42:55 - shouldn't in general if you just to ask
42:57 - me Chris should I do early access I'd
42:59 - say no I don't know why somewhere it's
43:02 - kind of like Platformers Indies were
43:03 - just Inception like some brain wave came
43:05 - and they said I've got to make an early
43:07 - access puzzle platformer I don't know
43:09 - where that came in but so many Indies
43:10 - make puzzle games and so many Indies do
43:12 - Early Access in general I don't like
43:15 - Early Access because it's I consider it
43:17 - high risk High reward the way early
43:20 - access goes is if it goes well it goes
43:22 - very well and if it goes poorly it goes
43:23 - very poorly and the reason is um Early
43:27 - Access if you don't sell very much in
43:31 - the in the beginning I did some analysis
43:32 - if you search my blog for Early Access I
43:35 - found that if you get under a 100
43:38 - reviews you have like a 1% chance of
43:41 - actually like getting enough sales to
43:43 - justify the game's presence on Steam um
43:47 - it's very hard to work yourself out of a
43:50 - hole in Early Access and so the reason I
43:52 - say it's high risk High reward is if you
43:55 - flub The Early Access launch a lot of
43:56 - IND treat Early Access like I just want
43:58 - to get a little I just want to get some
43:59 - feedback I'm just going to put it out on
44:00 - Early Access see what people think and
44:02 - if it it does well then I'll keep
44:04 - working on because a lot of times when
44:07 - you just put it out there early that's
44:08 - your launch that as soon as somebody can
44:11 - spend money on your game that is your
44:13 - launch and you need that seven you know
44:16 - how I said you need 7,000 wish list you
44:18 - need that for your Early Access launch
44:19 - and a lot of Indies think oh I don't
44:20 - have 7,000 I'm just going to put it out
44:22 - in Early Access see what people think
44:23 - then I'm going to try for the 7,000 you
44:25 - need that 7,000 your Early Access launch
44:28 - this is why I think Early Access is so
44:30 - hard is
44:31 - because you've never if if this is your
44:34 - first game you need to provide enough
44:36 - content to the game to make it like
44:39 - interesting for people to do early
44:41 - access for somebody to buy and say yeah
44:43 - this was a good purchase but not so much
44:45 - content that you spend so long working
44:47 - on it that you're missing out on that
44:49 - time of Early Access development it's
44:51 - like you're like threading the needle
44:53 - between two things and it's so hard
44:55 - games alone are hard to make it's much
44:58 - harder to like thread it between the too
45:00 - early but not too early type of
45:02 - thing no that's why I say just your
45:05 - first game just just try and get it out
45:07 - there um because if you fail on your
45:09 - Early Access launch it's dead and then
45:11 - what happens with Early Access because
45:13 - Early Access is like hey come build it
45:15 - with us you'll get some people on there
45:16 - that are really mean to you they're like
45:18 - You released this early access game and
45:20 - I paid money for it and I want updates
45:22 - every single month and and they believe
45:25 - that they that you owe
45:27 - constant updates and so now you're
45:30 - sitting on a game that launched poorly
45:31 - and you got this weird guy on the
45:33 - internet yelling at you because you're
45:34 - not doing enough in updates that is just
45:36 - a recipe for hating your life um so
45:39 - don't do that that's why I always
45:40 - recommend your first couple games don't
45:41 - do Early Access but if you were looking
45:45 - to see like what should my numbers be
45:47 - like am I ready for Early Access I
45:49 - talked to a couple developers up um one
45:51 - of the interviews that I did for my blog
45:53 - was with deep rock Galactic survivors
45:55 - they do nothing but Early Access games
45:57 - games that studio and they always
45:59 - recommend doing stuff um you need at
46:02 - least 10 to 20 hours of content for your
46:05 - Early Access launch so the type of games
46:07 - that do well in Early Access are these
46:09 - systems driven procedurally generated
46:12 - games that can just quickly do 10 to 20
46:14 - hours and then over the course of Early
46:16 - Access by the time of your 1.0 launch
46:19 - you've got like 30 hours of content that
46:21 - is the scale of game that does well in
46:23 - Early Access so if you're making a
46:25 - puzzle platformer with like one hour of
46:27 - content and you're trying to do Early
46:28 - Access launch you're going to have poor
46:30 - sales and there's going to be an
46:31 - internet man who yells at you every day
46:34 - I don't think you want that that's why I
46:36 - say just put it out on 1.0 just skip the
46:38 - whole Early Access thing does that make
46:41 - sense yeah yeah that does Mak sense and
46:43 - actually from that I you don't want the
46:45 - internet man to yell at you internet man
46:47 - is the
46:48 - worst uh so yeah I guess uh a follow up
46:51 - related to the very first question which
46:52 - is so you're talking about how in Early
46:54 - Access if the Early Access launch
46:55 - doesn't do very well it's very hard to
46:58 - uh kind of go back to it and have a
47:00 - successful 1.0 launch in the in the
47:02 - beginning you were talking about how
47:03 - steam is like a success letter so you
47:05 - got to get 7,000 wish list to get on the
47:07 - popular upcoming to then get on new and
47:09 - trending to kind of kick off the
47:10 - algorithm so basically I guess the
47:12 - question is if I have a bad Early Access
47:14 - launch what are the odds that I can turn
47:16 - around make it a successful launch what
47:18 - are the odds that I can actually kick
47:19 - the algorithm in order to hopefully have
47:21 - a successful
47:23 - 1.0 it is very rare I don't know the
47:26 - number is right off the top of my head I
47:28 - can actually send you a link Hugo after
47:29 - that to put down below to this article
47:32 - but it is so if you get let let let me
47:35 - tell you the upper end I found that if
47:37 - you have 250 reviews by your launch like
47:41 - if you do Early Access and in the first
47:43 - month you get 250 reviews you have about
47:46 - a 30% chance of having a thousand
47:49 - reviews by your One auto launch okay so
47:52 - so 1,000 reviews by the way there's
47:54 - nothing in the algorithm that's just
47:56 - kind of my Eng that hey your game did
47:58 - well it's just a number I picked out
47:59 - thought 1,000's a good number that's a
48:01 - good sign so even if you do very well
48:04 - get 250 reviews in your first month of
48:06 - being in Early Access you have a 30%
48:09 - chance of succeeding with a thousand
48:12 - reviews that is how risky it is so it is
48:15 - very and then it goes down sharply after
48:17 - that under that 250 so if you don't get
48:20 - 250 reviews in your first month on Steam
48:23 - the numbers are even worse it's like 1%
48:25 - chance of getting to a th000 inters but
48:27 - check that blog you'll see the graph
48:28 - that I made and I got this graph by I
48:30 - scraped data from every game that had an
48:33 - early access launch and then went to 1.0
48:36 - and I just compared the one month of
48:38 - Early Access launch to the one month of
48:41 - that 1.0 and compared to see what the
48:43 - differences were and saw how many games
48:44 - actually
48:45 - improved it is very rare I think I found
48:47 - like six games that beat the odds and
48:49 - had a poor Early Access launch and then
48:52 - had a good 1.0 it was like six games
48:54 - since like 2016 so it is very very very
48:57 - very hard to succeed after an early
48:59 - access launch I am sorry that's just the
49:01 - way it is yeah so basically it sounds
49:03 - like Early Access very risky and
49:05 - definitely should not be a decision
49:07 - taken lightly definitely should focus
49:09 - very hard I wish steam would call it
49:11 - something different than Early Access I
49:12 - wish they would call it like hard mode
49:14 - like do you want to do hard mode check
49:15 - the box and you're like yeah I would
49:17 - I'll do it but when it sounds Early
49:19 - Access it just sounds so nice you're
49:20 - like oh ACC early what's so bad about it
49:24 - no it's they should call it hard mode
49:28 - all right so yeah that was awesome all
49:29 - those are interesting questions those
49:31 - are a great aners so I hope a lot of

for having me Hugo my name is Chris Zukowski I run a site called how to Market a game and basically every single week I write a quick blog post studying the steam Marketplace to see what is actually helping people Market their games I look at games that have succeeded and I break down their strategy step by step these are real stories these aren't theories or anything I also do broadbased surveys and data analysis where I like scrape data from steam or I go to data that has been scraped by somebody else and I just kind of look at market trends and see what's going on so that you can actually Market your game get it seen get it sold and actually do this for a fulltime living all right yeah that's awesome I mean I have to say that I'm myself I've learned quite a lot by reading your blog by reading the newsletter I've been reading it for many years and a lot of what I know about marketing came from uh reading you so thanks for doing that uh all right so yeah so I guess uh we're going to start off with a quick presentation like a high level overview on the things must know about steam game marketing and then I'll ask a bunch of follow questions so yep go ahead sounds great yeah so um as Hugo mentioned um I do this uh professionally and I teach others and the way I do that is I I create this course this online course called how to Market a game wish list and visibility Master Class um we've probably got a link down below for this thing um but um as part of this uh what I teach is really how to Market your game and the way that it works is a lot of Indies get frustrated because they're always like tweeting tweeting Tweeting or they always post on Reddit and it goes nowhere like it's like what else do I need to do and really what a lot of Indies don't understand or it's not as apparently visible is the real strategy for how you do this and and and I'll kind of break it down is basically the underlying thing is you by yourself just tweeting out into the void is not enough to actually just Market the game like not enough people can see your tweets or your Reddit posts or whatever platform you do you need somebody else to help you boost that up and the primary way that actually works to actually get visibility on your game are couple ways the first is online festivals these are festivals where you apply they feature your game on the front page of steam because steam features these all the time and then all these people are going going through Steam they see this big banner that says hey like City build Builder festival and you're making a city Builder and you click and you go in and you have your game right there on the top now these festivals run all the time and my community U manages a list where we find these festivals people come to me people are starting to come to me who organize these festivals and say hey Chris can you feature this Festival we're doing this type of festival and so what you do is you just track it you you subscribe my newsletter or my Discord I guess we'll put a link down below and you just get notified when a new and if it applies to your game and your situation you know you just apply for it hopefully get in that is a huge way to get wish lists the second way is from streamers just like Hugo but mostly the um General audience that you know makes that plays games and sends those to the general audience Hugo you're you're great but it's more for developers um we're talking let's players and know big ones are like splatter cat Northern lion iron pineapple if you're making a Souls like game these streamers bring in so much traffic and sometimes people trip up with the term streamer I just mean somebody who plays games online that could be YouTube or twitch but YouTube really provides more traffic I find and so basically you take your game you give it to them and they play it and then you get tons of wish lists it doesn't necessarily lead directly to sales a lot of people think that streamers once your game goes on sale is going to lead to a big cash influx it does not typically what happens is you give it to them you get a ton of wish wish list and then the next time your game goes on discount then all those a lot of those wish lists will convert about 20% of those wish lists if it's a good streamer so the combination of those two things are the primary way that most games get visibility on Steam it is not you just sending out little tiny tweets here and there um it really takes these big efforts um and so it's about um you know just knowing where these places are how to apply and what to get what you need to do to get that visibility and um oh somebody always asks too with streamers hey how do I get streamers to play my game it's very simple if your game is interesting you have to have a good steam page with great graphics looking good a good thumbnail that you did not do yourself don't make your own thumbnail because you need a professional illustrator to make something interesting because YouTubers live or die by their thumbnail I'm sure Hugo knows that if your thumbnail is not good people don't click and watch your video so streamers need good graphics for that thumbnail and if your page has a great thumbnail streamers are more likely to play your game because they say ah that looks like a great thumbnail all I have to do is copy that put that in put my face on it and then we're good to go but if you have an ugly thumbnail now the streamer is like oh God I gotta go find somebody to make a thumbnail for me out of a screenshot they have to do more work they want good graphics good thumbnails then two what you got to do is put up your demo now this is an important thing too many people skip this step you want a nice demo that's really fun and you keep it up and all you do is you message the streamer and you say hey I'm making this game you play this type of game uh I think you're going to like this you grab your thumbnail say here's my thumbnail you grab a link to your demo say Demo's live now you can play it right now and you send that off to the streamer if they like your game they will play it now a lot of people say Chris I tried all this and nobody uh nobody responded uh it must be going to spam it did not go to spam it's just that streamers don't have enough time to play every game that comes across their desk so they don't write no not because they hate you or they're afraid to tell you no it's just it it's just a list that they have of games that they're kind of interested in playing and if a hot one comes in it just cuts in front of you in line because the stream is like oh I got to play this new game and yours just gets bumped down so it's not that they don't like your game it's just that you're not as exciting as the other games that came in that's why they don't say no to you and say oh I'm not going to cover this nobody says no it's just if you've been up sending out the emails and you're not getting responses maybe it's time to either up the the steam page make it look a little bit more exciting tighten your pitch tighten your demo and then you'll start to get those responses from streamers so that's the big things that I would say that you really need to get going is get a demo out and the earlier the possible to get that demo out because you need those streamers to play it not at launch not when you're launching your game you want those streamers to play it nice and early because that'll increase your wish list influx you'll also have more chances at getting into festivals and a lot of streamers look at festivals for finding games that they play on stream so the combination of those two is really how most games get their visibility and take off that is what it takes to Market your game on Steam so Hugo I'm I'm here to answer any questions you might have all right yeah that was awesome that was a great high level overview of how marketing Works how I mean marketing is really basically just the study of attention how to get people to pay attention to your game because basically what I always say is it makes no sense to spend so much effort on your game and spend no effort on actually trying to Market it so I feel that is especially nowadays with so much uh so many games coming out everything is so crowded if you're going to put in so much effort into making something really special then I think it also makes sense put in a ton of effort making people actually know that your awesome thing exists all right so yeah I definitely do have a bunch of awesome questions and it's awesome how you mention a bunch of things like festivals and demos I definitely want to get to those but before let's actually start off with the simplest one of all which is how many wish lists should I have before release yeah minimum absolutely minimum I say is 7,000 and the reason I say this is the way steam's visibility algorithms work all these algorithms is it's kind of like a ladder if each step gets you enough visibility to qualify you for the next step and the next step and the next step and the way the team works just by happen stance their first kind of rung in that ladder is what we call uh popular upcoming so about a week before you release steam looks at all the games that have somewhere around 7,000 I've seen some games games get in with 5,000 it depends on how many other games they're launching some games with 6,000 and if they see they just pull that list they say one week out the algorithm just goes out oh these are all the games that have 6,000 7,000 wish list thereabouts here let's put them in a list and they just rank you based on your exact time that you release so if you say 1201 a on this day well you're going to be at the top of the list and then it it goes down from that so that list there's 10 games in that popular upcoming and they show up and then as new games are reaching after new G release they pop off the list and the next game in the list pops up so it just is a constant flowing list of games in that popular upcoming and it gives you a ton of visibility uh by a lot of measures we see that games that are on there get about a thousand wish lists a day and so if you time it right you can end up in there four days five days if you play the game right um so then that's the week just before launch and then from there if you convert those wish list and a lot of people buy the next step on the ladder is what we call new and trending and so you have to sell a bunch of game sell a bunch of copies within a short period of time just based on the research that I've done it's about selling $8,000 gross revenue this is the pre steam cut pretax is just raw $88,000 earned that's usually pretty competitive to end up on new and trending and just like popular on upcoming your game just stays on there until more games pop it off you know as games release and sell $8,000 within a short period of time they start bumping you off um and you just stay on there there and so that combo those are the first two steps of the ladder and there's other things like um Discovery que that if you convert well and you have a ton of visibility they will give you a spot in this widget called Discovery queue so those combination of those three kind of are the start of the visibility ramp on Steam on once you launch your game now if you miss that like you don't get that 7,000 then it just it's really hard to climb that ladder so if you don't get enough wish list at that time you're not on popular upcoming and then it's really hard to get those you know those last minute wish lists those 1,000 per day you don't get those and then it's hard to convert enough of those wish lists show up on new and trending so you see you can just see the ladder start just going away if you don't start making those steps up the ladder so that's why I say 7,000 minimum to get in there now yeah so that number is not not necessarily set in stone right it's uh like you were saying it depends on what other games are coming out around that time so it might be 7,000 5,000 so B there's no magic number written directly in the algorithm saying if above 7,000 go here if not go there yeah and it's it's a little bit wobbly so one thing that I like to to recommend people is look at your game go to steamdb on your on your game um and you'll see a ranking if if you're ranked and usually the ranking happens right around 7,000 wish list see it's all relative to all the other games on Steam what steam's actually doing is they're just pulling the most wishlisted games that release that that week okay and so when you look on steamdb if you have enough wish list right around 5,000 7,000 it'll say rank number and it'll say like you are number 5,000 in wish list that means of all the games on Steam and it's usually like the first 2,000 is when you get the number assigned to you because there's so many games on Steam that the top 2,000 games that have not yet released get a rank number if you have a rank number that means you're a pretty good shot of getting on uh new and trending or popular upcoming I should say popular upcoming because I think the algorithm actually just says how many games show me all the ranked games that have a release date within the next week that's I think what the algorithm does so sometimes if there aren't a lot of games that are out there you can get in that ranked number with fewer wishless that's the kind of why we're saying there's no full number it's kind of like you're everybody's running in a race together and they just pick the top front of that race all right yeah so so yeah basically roughly have 7,000 in order to get on that basically start the ball rolling and then steam basically you got to kick off the steam algorithm and once it starts then it starts basically working for you but you have to first get that initial thing so yeah that's a a great one let me just put one more let me just say one more caveat to that now this is one thing that I often hear because I talked to a lot of Indies so I hear a lot of the comments some people might say well I heard about 30,000 wish list or 50,000 wish list some people say that now what this is coming from is typically Publishers if you sign with a publisher your publisher really wants you to get to 30,000 or 50,000 somewhere in that range depending on the publisher the reason that is is because remember I said there was that new and trending where you have to get $8,000 within like the first 24 hours like within a short period of time well Publishers have been around enough and they know that to get to 8,000 sales your wish lists have to convert enough wish list have to convert and they want that kind of buffer so if you're con you could convert at 20% like all your wish lists convert at 20% 20% of all the wish lists you earned convert that's awesome but some games have a little softer they only convert at like 5% or 1% I've seen games that do all those range anywhere between 1 to 30% I've seen and so if it turns out by whatever Factor your game is a low converter like 1,000 when you have 30,000 or 50,000 wish list that just gives you a a bigger margin of error so that those 1% of 30,000 will give you enough sales to get you into new and trending so see there's no line in the algorithm says if you do this you do that it's more they just kind of look at conversion rates and that because um uh it really just you need that buffer to earn that money and that's why Publishers will say oh you need 50,000 or 30,000 not because that's a solid number in the algorithm just because that is more likely to give you enough sales and enough dollar earned to rank on new and trending so it's complicated but it's not yeah yeah I mean that's uh great uh extra information yeah definitely uh basically the idea of a buffer zone and conversion rate yeah that is definitely also important uh so yeah second very important question when should I start marketing my game yeah I personally like to do it IM mediately so what as soon as I've got a game idea or need to have something visible here's here's what I recommend is I've got uh three sometimes four depending on if I ate breakfast that day uh recommendations of when you're ready for to start marketing your game um and by marketing your game I'm specifically talking about putting up a steam page that says wish list now and here's kind of my rules one you definitely know what type of game it is you're like you know sometimes maybe you're like well maybe it's going to be an action RPG maybe it's going to be a Rog likee maybe it's just going to be a linear narrative game you know all of those could be like a 2d game or a Metroid Vania or a Rog like action Rog like once you know sometimes that kind of changes during development when you are sure you're like this is definitely a Metroid Vania there's no doubt about it I'm making a Metroid Vania that's first step second step is your graphic style has to be decided and by decided I mean you know like oh we're definitely going cartoony we're going to look it's going to have big Blobby features you know all that kind of stuff or you're like I'm going to go Grim dark everything's going to be black and white and covered in blood whatever it is you've picked the actual art style that you're going to go with okay third thing you need is I recommend four different environments four different biomes four different you know just scenes so that it looks unique the main thing that I see that the problem that Indies when they first throw up their first steam page is I can tell you made one environment and you just shifted the camera around and I could see everything in the background's the same you know like there's a tower in the back and I can tell in one screenshot the tower's over here then the same Tower's over here then the tow is here I can tell you just kind of like Pan the camera around the same one office or the one you know like level area that's not going to cut it with steam you need different environments different levels like snow biome uh fire biome uh you know the forest you want different things now I know you're still in development you can mock this up they're just screenshots um so I recommend you you know you just make the art in the right art style and you stage it up like in unity or whatever you're using so it looks like a different scene it doesn't have to function if it could be like I just run through the tree and there no it just doesn't clip or you know the enemies are just like still they're posed it's like it's just a screenshot they we they don't need to know that there's no AI or the thing's not coded you just have to Stage it don't lie but just stage it so it looks unique and then from there the last thing that I always recommend is a trailer you really should have a trailer because it means you're serious the other reason I say you need a trailer when you kind of do this announce is a big marketing beat remember how I said you need external people streamers Festival goers sometimes the Press YouTubers a big marketing beat when you kick off your game is your announce trailer so you make a trailer you title it announce trailer and you put it out there and you reach out to like IGN and streamers and and the press and say Here's my announce trailer just saying announce trailer makes people stand up and go I must cover this game so that's why I say you should also have a trailer so those four things a known genre you know what your genre is you know what the art style is you've made enough screenshots for four environments and you have a trailer those are the four things to actually start marketing your game okay that's that's interesting so so basically you you would say it's not necessarily recommended to just basically have just screenshots no Trail just a rough idea just you know what the game is going to be but you haven't yet made a nice polished trailer so you would say better to wait for it and really kick off with a like you said a nice marketing beat as opposed to just just make this coming soon Page live you would say wait for a proper marketing beat yes don't just fart your page out there don't just like n it's a Thursday I'm going to put it live do it no it has to be a big moment so you start working with uh either content creators like on Tik Tok or maybe you reach out to IGN find IGN say we have a secret trailer we are getting ready to announce our game do you want to have exclusive access and you send them their trailer and they're like this trailer is good like you do this like a month before you're going to announce or or you know how I said those festivals you reach out to the festival organizers you look at my website how tomarket game.com festivals is the festival list you look at that festival list and you see what's coming up and you start applying to festivals even though you don't have a steam page yet with your trailer and you say we're getting ready to announce this game can we get into the TR into your Festival you would get the announce of our game in your festival and then the organizers are like we get this special moment where we to announce this person's game we're definitely going to feature them in the thing so again you see how you're using the fact that you nobody's heard about you and then all of a sudden something will be heard as a special ticket and you're you're going around to a bunch of people and saying do you want to cash this ticket you get to cash it who wants to cash it and then somebody says I do if you just fart your page out you just put it up for no reason you don't have a trailer you just took that ticket and you just crumpled it up and threw it on the ground you know what I mean so use that ticket it's given to you okay so yeah so basically the announcement should be a nice important thing to kick things off nicely uh so yeah I mean you spoke about Festival so just a quick question should you participate in a steam Festival I mean nowadays things are quite a bit more crud but do you still think it's a good idea and basically when should you participate yeah so there's several types of festivals and I'll just qu clarify this the big big one is Steam nextfest and and there's nothing special about steam nextfest it's actually very crowded right now the main reason people always talk about steam nextfest is it's one that you everybody's guaranteed every everybody who has a steam page can do one and only one steam next test and you get to choose when you want to do it it's like having one bullet that you get to fire everybody gets to fire their one bullet but you can only do it February October and June I don't know why I did them in that order but that's that's not the order but there's three of them per year February June October those are the three dayses and so you get to pick which one of those three you want to do now um it is crowded definitely is and I just published a blog post if you go to how tomarket game.com blog you can see my latest one it's about um ziv Nelson Jr and what they did was they basically said we're going to do our steam next test right off that and what they did was they knew they were getting a huge Boost from being in a game show like Jeff Key's festival and they just paired it with steam nextfest see because he knows when he can fire that bullet he said I'm gonna I'm going to use it strategically and use my one time to pair it with this big Festival announce and he announced this game so he was basically firing three bullets at the same time all the other festivals that I list at how tomarket game.com festivals all those festivals are just random you don't know if you're going to get to them you apply and you get in they might like your game they might not so that's why we spend extra time talking about steam nextfest but all the other festivals change sometimes the festivals have nobody else in them it's like 50 games get in it's a very exclusive Festival some games is like everybody gets in it's like there's 2,000 games in the festival it just depends and there's also themed festivals there's like cozy games and if you're in a cozy game it's usually smaller and the audience is like very dedicated they love every cozy game they wish list every single one they buy every single one there's like narrative game festivals like n Ludo naron if you're writing a a um Adventure game or a visual novel those do very well because again that audience is very tuned in but if it's a general Festival like I don't know action games H that's so Broad and there's so many different types of people that those don't convert as well but here's the thing I still even if the W Festival only got you a 100 wish lists and they convert poorly hey that's 100 wish lists and a poorly converting wish list that you didn't have at the beginning there's no downside to participating in a festival other than maybe the time to kind of like manage you know the upload and applying and maybe if you did a custom demo for them um some of them do have a little bit of a cost it's usually not too much it's usually like in hundred to ,000 but the visibility they give you is very good so anywhere in that range there's really no big downside to a participating in a Fest okay yeah festivals do seem to be a big part of marketing games nowadays so yeah that was definitely very helpful now one question that I really want to ask you which is actually something that I saw on a blog post that you made uh quite a while ago is how how uh basically it was a graph of how many games a studio makes and how like so many studios make one game very few Studios make the second third and so on so basically my question is would you recommend someone spends let's say five years working on just one game trying to make like one huge Masterpiece or in those same five years make five different games which one would you recommend you go you you're man at my heart okay so I my basic complaint for all Indies out there is that you spend way too long working on your first game or any game um and I know it sounds easy it's easy for me just to say you spending too long on it um what we found was about 75% of Studios will release one game and then nothing else I don't know what happens to them some of them go off and make a second Studio or something but this is data that I scrape from stream the number of Studios who have released two games is very very small after that it's like 7,000 so I think it's like um you know down to like 10% of Studios will actually make two games and then it goes down even further like 0 1% or something release three games uh just even further and further um but here's the thing most of your success happens in your second and your third and your fourth because games roll forward so even if your first game didn't do very well there's still a lot of people who bought it who are wishlisting it and there's some people that love you they like man this is my one of my favorite games I know it didn't sell well but I love this game so what you do is you take this audience because every day your game is on sto on the store getting viewed by people when you release even if it wasn't a big seller still getting views and when you release your second game you take that that audience and you put it on there and then all of a sudden your second game is starting at about here and then you're building on top of that and then it's a third game and the fourth game and so they just stack and I find that most success comes fourth fifth game now knowing that this should change your strategy if you were thinking I'm going to make the perfect game my first game you will never finish it or you're just going to die basically so what I recommend is don't make your dream game your first game just don't I know a lot of people I get a lot of emails I'm working on my dream game this is my I've always wanted to make this game I say I know it's hard but tuck it away you're not ready for your first game okay you got to make smaller first games that hey you you like you're interested in but they're not your dream game and so what you do is you level up and you grow an ability to get to your dream game like your fourth or fifth release and then you've got a lot of codebase you know how to make games you know like every game has a setting screen work on your setting screen your first game and then just use the same setting screen basically for all your future games saves you Dev time um all that kind of stuff and your audience will grow over time it's just so much it is impossible to have your first game succeed and even if you're like well what about this game most of the time if you look back they've been releasing games for decades it is very very very hard to make your first game of success so with that in mind structure your studio structure your Dev time to release a lot of small games and each one gets a little bit bigger until you get to your dream game okay that's my recommendation for Indies out there yeah that's awesome I mean what you're saying really resonates with me because I definitely do believe in the same way make multiple games as opposed to just one huge game and specifically what you mentioned about reusing things I mean for me something that I always talk about my channel is all about writing good clean code so that you can reuse it on many things like for example I've got my animation system that I made and reused in like four or five games so yeah that is definitely something that I very much believe in yeah and I do think that is the best approach okay so a bit of a potentially similar question so what are the best genres on Steam I mean I know steam is huge but should I make a cozy game should I make a dark and Moody game should I make a survival crafting game a city Builder what what does the team audience generally prefer okay I'm gonna kind of pair these with the previous one because I say hey make small games just make a quick small game and then he's like what the hell I I can't make a small game what you want me to Crunch no you pick genres that are smaller okay so your first game I'm sorry folks should not be an RPG because there's those games just have so much content they're so deep you just won't be able to finish it in time I'm sorry you just can't okay um and so what you do is in the interest of building up a code base and learning how games are designed because that's a big thing too just just knowing the design of games like what how hard should the game be what's how do you tutorial lifee that's all things you have to learn by making games so there are some genres that are pretty simple to make um are they do very well on Steam relatively and they give you that kind of experience and they could build up to the final game because really like if you think about it an RPG is really a lot of genres stacked together it's like you know you've got experience like incremental experience and spending it on upgrades you've got a narrative just typing the story you know writing out a story as a game you've got um kind of the battle whatever your battle whether it's real time or you know turnbased you've got a battle system you have like an exploration where you're like exploring the Overworld so that's like four or five games just for an RPG this is why you should not make an RPG for your first game because it's actually like six games duct taped together and present it to you so what I recommend is there is I study the market all the time and that's what I write about hard to Market game.com free is how to sign up for that but um all those genres um there are a lot of genres that are very small and actually are pieces that show up in like an RPG or some other genres and I'll let me list them out real quick so the small genres that I recommend Indies start out with is one like an incremental like an increment idle game sometimes call those do very well on Steam now you might say oh there's so many garbage ones if they're good they go up and I know banana yeah yeah yeah but um it's there's other ones that I'd recommend that you check out like chill quarium is one um micro civilization is another one Loi beats I think it's called Loi beats uh yeah the one that is the something like that yeah yeah it's it's it it's not actually ly girl I think she's featured in there um but it's an incremental game where if you just idle if you just concentrate you do work your numbers tick up and then you can buy upgrades for your thing those are those Idol games research that genre look at the top sellers if you do them right very Pro very um very positive effect oh another one is Rusty's retirement but the good thing about those increments is they teach you how XP grows how to buy upgrades in an interesting way because you need to do the loop interesting so it's a very selfcontained small game that teaches you the fundamentals and doesn't take as long as a big RPG that's your dream game but a lot of the code that you use in your increment can be adapted for your RPG down the line and so you might learn like your first incremental game people like God this game sucks it's it's too slow and you're like oh okay I got to tune this up so you learn in your second game maybe make a second idler and you're like oh I changed the progression so that you earn xp faster oh man and people like that's great you did it good job then you take those Lessons Learned and you apply it to your RPG dream game later on that's just an example another genre that's really big are um Auto Battlers you B basically upgrade a bunch of little units and you say go get them and then you just you don't control it you just push a button that says go and then they those little units that you've upgraded go and they attack some monsters and there's some number system that determines who's the winner that's an auto battler very hot genre again you can do it in small bits and it's like a piece of an RPG remember how we talked about battle systems the lessons that you learn building an auto battler can be applied to an RPG third one narrative games are hard but there are a couple genres that actually do pretty well one is a horror game now most of the time I say that your game has to be deep and systematic horror games are games that should be um very small like two hours Max and it's usually just a camera rolling around in a spooky dungeon or something and there's some monster chasing you it's a great way to learn animation just how to work a camera system a little bit of narrative like they click something and it tells a little story on there but it's like dark and brooding those are excellent games f Master development time and people love horror games especially if your Monster's really gross and like their head is sideways or they're a girl dressed in white and she has black eyes and she screams at you people people love those that's like an instant like uh good way to do a horror game um I know I'm seeing it sounds fake and cynical but this is what the steam audience wants are those type of games um and the other genres that uh do pretty well that are pretty uh good is one is um what I call they don't really have a genre they're called like the St stacking games and there these little cards stack lands is one uh the one that invented it is called cultist simulator look those up and they're basically games where you take cards and you stack these cards and the way you stack them kind of as like building a a city or it's like your your crafting things again this is code that you learn here that can be applied to a bigger game so these are all genres that are very good and I recommend um stay away from Platformers Platformers just don't sell very well especially PL puzzle Platformers those sell very very poorly um and I for some reason Indies think that that's their first I don't know where that message got out but they just sell so poorly because people don't like getting stuck in puzzle games and so really watch out for those I know you're probably watching this and you're like I just making a puzzle platformer I know it's hard I made I made some my first games were puzzle platforms they didn't sell well it's just the nature of it people just don't like them on Steam those previous genres that I I mentioned do much better so if you're making a puzzle platform just don't throw it away don't blow up your computer just put a just like do a do your last commit start a new one you know if you're like man I worked three years on this thing I'm so sick of it hey just put it aside take a little vacation from your game and and make an idler or something they they're just so much more popular I see it it's like night and day popularity between those games and and you're going to love Game Dev again if you start making a genre that Ste Lov yeah I was going to say my my next question was going to be so many Indies start with Platformers so should I do a platformer so apparently the answer is no but yeah a lot of a lot of Indies definitely do start start with that and yeah it's a very tricky and another thing that I've al already heard you say several times is how horror is supposedly a great genre because it's very simple to make something and it really just needs something a little bit interesting as long as it has a little hook something that is slightly different it doesn't have to be super complex and yeah definitely personally I have to say for me horror is not the kind of games that I don't like to play I get scared way too easily but you your uh comments on the genre definitely made me slightly convinced that I should probably give it a try because yeah it seems like a seems like can be a good genre here here's here's one thing a lot of people wonder about I don't like horror horror sells so well so well and you don't even have to be a fan to make a horror game and let me let me explain um I'm I'm a big film buff I love movies I'm always I'm always reading about film and stuff like that um I love movies um one of the best horror films ever made The Shining made by Stanley cubrick that guy didn't even like horror movies he only made The Shining because his previous movie that he made was a total flop nobody liked it he's like God these horror movies are always hits I need a hit I'm gonna make the best horror movie ever I don't even like him and so he read all these horror books and he's like I hate this book I hate this book and then he found The Shining he's like this is a good story and he decided to make The Shining this classic horror film just because he wanted a hit and like this is very similar to Indies they're like I'm sick of making these puzzle Platformers that never sell I'm sick of it fine I'm just gonna make a horror game and they do amazingly well you don't have to be like the biggest horror fan but one thing I do recommend is play a couple horror games I know it might be scary but put on your designer hat like I'm not scared I'm just investigating the design and look at really how horror games are built like why they work now I know a lot of Indies they try and make a horror game but they like bring in this like game designer brain where they're like well it's not actually a horror game it's more of a card battler where your systems are the horror and and they add all these extra systems no no no no no just make it a straightup horror game where it's like I'm just a dude running through some dark corridors and there's a girl dressed all in White and her eyes are black and like bleeding and she screams at me like just make a freaking horror game that's like a real horror game don't try and like over complicate it with all these game Design Systems that don't belong in a horror game it just got to be scary just make it scary okay yeah maybe I should try that uh okay so yeah in terms of uh let's say that I'm prototyping I'm trying to figure out so I'm trying to follow your guide on uh trying to choose a genre that is good for Steam and trying to wait a little bit before making my Big Marketing push announcing the game so in between that point in between making a prototype until I'm sure that I know my idea how should I validate that idea should I like post gifts on Twitter something like that how do I how do I test do I know okay this genre this idea is potentially viable so I'm going to push through it yeah yeah so what I um uh search on my blog hadark game.com um search genre I've done a lot of genre reports um also um because we're doing this as part of the summer sale if you click the link down below I do this every year I do this uh lecture Series where I look at the previous year and I look at the genres that are hot and I track it every time because one thing any time I talk about a genre that's hot people are like well it's hot this year was it hot last year what's changing it doesn't change that much that's that's a big myth that a lot of Indies fall for they get too scared of they think oh well the genres change so fast they don't actually change too fast because the biggest genres are strategy games um horror games Civilization like forx style games firstperson Shooters those genres have been popular since way back in my when I was like 16 years old city I used to play so many city builders strategy games and firstperson shooters guess what they're still hot um but anyway so I talk about um in that in that class it's called game marketing ideas you'll see the last two years of lectures where I go by straight down the line of what genres are selling on Steam so that's one resource and and Hugo you and I have collaborated if you buy it Hugo gets a nice little um present for for helping do that so you're supporting Hugo by doing by picking up game marketing ideas um but in general it's it's hard and this is why I do what I do it's it's hard you can you can kind of lie to yourself that a genre is hot when you look at the data because you'll find one that succeeds and what I really try and do and it's I I try and look at the medians of several genres and compare them and I look across so many different things like um streamers so it's it is you can do it I just recommend that you don't look at just the winners because every genre has one game that succeeds the difference is genres have a huge range of sales some sell very well some don't and so what I recommend is really looking across the time and that's kind of why I I do the writing so if you search my blog for genre you'll see what I recommend of the top genres and then from within that data that I've presented you can kind of pick games that are um the games that speak to you because this is games it should still be fun for you so if there's genres that you just absolutely absolutely don't like or actually are like kind of interested in you're like oh yeah that does sound interesting then you can try those and see if you actually they make a good fit for you so that's kind of how I'd recommend picking a game now to your question Hugo about how do you validate one way to validate yes is share it on Twitter like say hey here here's my monster and show a picture of your monster and see what it is um you can do the trailer but here's the problem is for the most part 99% of games don't impress just with their visuals most of them impress with their gameplay so it's kind of a hard thing I recommend you make a demo much earlier than most people expect so you try with some screenshots and some video uh you know of the game being played most of the time you won't get any good data out of that because it has to be a very very very goodlooking game to go viral on social media it's not until people play it and you give it to streamers and you enter into festivals with that demo do you start to see oh yeah this is getting some numbers I've seen a lot of games that did poorly on Twitter but as soon as they put out the the demo it the the the wish list skyrocketed and everybody loved the game so it's hard to do that early validation and not convince yourself it's a bad idea it's it's hard so I would just recommend make a lot of games make them quickly and learn that way interesting yeah I mean play testing is extremely important I mean at the end of the day we're making games so yeah if the game looks great but doesn't play great then it's not very it's not a very good game so yeah focusing on the play test making sure that the game design actually works yeah that is definitely very important so let's say that I've published my game or I'm about to publish my game should I go with Early Access or not or are there specific genres that should go into Early Access and some that shouldn't in general if you just to ask me Chris should I do early access I'd say no I don't know why somewhere it's kind of like Platformers Indies were just Inception like some brain wave came and they said I've got to make an early access puzzle platformer I don't know where that came in but so many Indies make puzzle games and so many Indies do Early Access in general I don't like Early Access because it's I consider it high risk High reward the way early access goes is if it goes well it goes very well and if it goes poorly it goes very poorly and the reason is um Early Access if you don't sell very much in the in the beginning I did some analysis if you search my blog for Early Access I found that if you get under a 100 reviews you have like a 1% chance of actually like getting enough sales to justify the game's presence on Steam um it's very hard to work yourself out of a hole in Early Access and so the reason I say it's high risk High reward is if you flub The Early Access launch a lot of IND treat Early Access like I just want to get a little I just want to get some feedback I'm just going to put it out on Early Access see what people think and if it it does well then I'll keep working on because a lot of times when you just put it out there early that's your launch that as soon as somebody can spend money on your game that is your launch and you need that seven you know how I said you need 7,000 wish list you need that for your Early Access launch and a lot of Indies think oh I don't have 7,000 I'm just going to put it out in Early Access see what people think then I'm going to try for the 7,000 you need that 7,000 your Early Access launch this is why I think Early Access is so hard is because you've never if if this is your first game you need to provide enough content to the game to make it like interesting for people to do early access for somebody to buy and say yeah this was a good purchase but not so much content that you spend so long working on it that you're missing out on that time of Early Access development it's like you're like threading the needle between two things and it's so hard games alone are hard to make it's much harder to like thread it between the too early but not too early type of thing no that's why I say just your first game just just try and get it out there um because if you fail on your Early Access launch it's dead and then what happens with Early Access because Early Access is like hey come build it with us you'll get some people on there that are really mean to you they're like You released this early access game and I paid money for it and I want updates every single month and and they believe that they that you owe constant updates and so now you're sitting on a game that launched poorly and you got this weird guy on the internet yelling at you because you're not doing enough in updates that is just a recipe for hating your life um so don't do that that's why I always recommend your first couple games don't do Early Access but if you were looking to see like what should my numbers be like am I ready for Early Access I talked to a couple developers up um one of the interviews that I did for my blog was with deep rock Galactic survivors they do nothing but Early Access games games that studio and they always recommend doing stuff um you need at least 10 to 20 hours of content for your Early Access launch so the type of games that do well in Early Access are these systems driven procedurally generated games that can just quickly do 10 to 20 hours and then over the course of Early Access by the time of your 1.0 launch you've got like 30 hours of content that is the scale of game that does well in Early Access so if you're making a puzzle platformer with like one hour of content and you're trying to do Early Access launch you're going to have poor sales and there's going to be an internet man who yells at you every day I don't think you want that that's why I say just put it out on 1.0 just skip the whole Early Access thing does that make sense yeah yeah that does Mak sense and actually from that I you don't want the internet man to yell at you internet man is the worst uh so yeah I guess uh a follow up related to the very first question which is so you're talking about how in Early Access if the Early Access launch doesn't do very well it's very hard to uh kind of go back to it and have a successful 1.0 launch in the in the beginning you were talking about how steam is like a success letter so you got to get 7,000 wish list to get on the popular upcoming to then get on new and trending to kind of kick off the algorithm so basically I guess the question is if I have a bad Early Access launch what are the odds that I can turn around make it a successful launch what are the odds that I can actually kick the algorithm in order to hopefully have a successful 1.0 it is very rare I don't know the number is right off the top of my head I can actually send you a link Hugo after that to put down below to this article but it is so if you get let let let me tell you the upper end I found that if you have 250 reviews by your launch like if you do Early Access and in the first month you get 250 reviews you have about a 30% chance of having a thousand reviews by your One auto launch okay so so 1,000 reviews by the way there's nothing in the algorithm that's just kind of my Eng that hey your game did well it's just a number I picked out thought 1,000's a good number that's a good sign so even if you do very well get 250 reviews in your first month of being in Early Access you have a 30% chance of succeeding with a thousand reviews that is how risky it is so it is very and then it goes down sharply after that under that 250 so if you don't get 250 reviews in your first month on Steam the numbers are even worse it's like 1% chance of getting to a th000 inters but check that blog you'll see the graph that I made and I got this graph by I scraped data from every game that had an early access launch and then went to 1.0 and I just compared the one month of Early Access launch to the one month of that 1.0 and compared to see what the differences were and saw how many games actually improved it is very rare I think I found like six games that beat the odds and had a poor Early Access launch and then had a good 1.0 it was like six games since like 2016 so it is very very very very hard to succeed after an early access launch I am sorry that's just the way it is yeah so basically it sounds like Early Access very risky and definitely should not be a decision taken lightly definitely should focus very hard I wish steam would call it something different than Early Access I wish they would call it like hard mode like do you want to do hard mode check the box and you're like yeah I would I'll do it but when it sounds Early Access it just sounds so nice you're like oh ACC early what's so bad about it no it's they should call it hard mode all right so yeah that was awesome all those are interesting questions those are a great aners so I hope a lot of people found this uh quite useful so yeah Chris you're currently running a summer sale on all of your courses so where can people go if they want to learn a bit more dive deeper into the world of marketing and how to increase their ODS of finding success on Steam yeah like I said every single one of my courses is on sale and I'm partnering with Hugo because youo I love your videos you do the best development videos I love watching them and a lot of people that you uh teach come back to my courses my community and say hey Chris we we heard about you from Hugo and he's great and I I agree so I partner with Hugo so if you buy the courses with the links below Hugo and I are like sharing we're just gonna we're like sharing stuff like like kids on a playground um so you you will help Hugo when you buy uh one of the courses down below so I have a course called wishlist invisibility master class and it talks a lot about what I was talking about but what do is I do Nitty Gritty like I don't do General like oh be sure to tweet about your things that you like no no it's like hardcore I tell you step by step what you need to do to succeed on the steam store like down to like the minute sometimes when you do these campaigns and that's what that course is the wish list invisibility Master Class um I also do a conference so you'll see some called inside conference um I've done them for two years in a row and I take the best talks that I've seen the previous year and I invite those developers those marketers on and I ask him questions like hey how did you actually do this campaign so I have like somebody who uh reaches out to streamers that's her whole job and I just asked her how do you reach out to streamers and she told me Bullet by Point by bullet point how to reach out to a streamer it's fantastic it's a great uh on hour lecture you'll learn more in that one hour than you do like in most like college courses um highly recommend it we've got a What's called the pitching and funding master class so if you're trying to get a publisher I worked with the best guy the guy that Jason deloka he for decades has been teaching Indies how to do uh Publishers like how to reach out to Publishers he and I teamed up made a course together so you can check that down below um so I've just got so many different courses oh the inside um game marketing ideas uh I talked about how every year I look back on the data from the previous year to see what genres are selling and do a big marketing report that shows up in the uh inside or the um game marketing ideas so all my courses uh on discount and if you buy the bundle I bought this Mega bundle if you're going to buy the two big master classes you get everything for just like 25 bucks more so that's really the best value um but check the links down below and again if you buy through these links Hugo uh benefits from it so we're really supporting Hugo by doing this so thank you so much all right that was awesome okay so thank you so much Chris for sharing all the knowledge with all of us here today thanks so much great it's great talking to you H go
