00:06 - release date is set for next week July
00:08 - 13 so please go to this team page and
00:10 - add it to your wishlist and phone this
00:12 - has definitely been a lot more work than
00:14 - I anticipated
00:15 - the original release was meant to be all
00:16 - the way back in May which I guess sort
00:18 - of works as a pregnant example of how
00:20 - you need to be very careful with your
00:22 - estimates but despite going over my
00:24 - original estimate I'm so pretty happy
00:25 - with how it's going it is composed of a
00:27 - launcher with all the completed games as
00:29 - well as the alerted section with tons of
00:31 - interactive tutorials so this definitely
00:33 - took went longer than I originally
00:34 - planned but I'm really happy with how it
00:36 - looks and of course it's only meant to
00:38 - be the beginning now with this team have
00:40 - functional I have a super easy way of
00:42 - doing lots of really cool things for
00:44 - example when I make another complete
00:45 - game which is something I'd like to do
00:47 - more of I can just update the build and
00:48 - you can play it very easily this also
00:51 - has the ability to make some really cool
00:52 - multiplayer tutorials and there's also
00:54 - my idea from very long ago of doing some
00:56 - livestream games which become much
00:58 - easier if I can just include a client
01:00 - directly in the steam gun so if you
01:02 - haven't yet please go to the store page
01:03 - and add it to your wishlist now I have
01:05 - to get back to work on it and get
