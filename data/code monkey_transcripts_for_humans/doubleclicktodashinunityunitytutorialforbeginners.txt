00:00 - in this video we're going to cover the
00:01 - simple logic for double-clicking and use
00:03 - it to trigger a special - let's begin
00:09 - [Music]
00:13 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:16 - and this channel is all about helping
00:17 - you learn how to make your own games
00:19 - with enough tutorials made by a
00:20 - professional indie game developer so if
00:22 - you find the video helpful consider
00:23 - subscribing so here is what we want to
00:26 - create I have my player character in
00:28 - here and I can click somewhere in the
00:30 - world in town to move and there you go
00:32 - he's moving there however I am also
00:34 - testing for double clicks in order to do
00:36 - a different special action so when I
00:38 - double click there you go he starts
00:40 - moving and does a nice - so a simple mic
00:43 - does one action and a double click does
00:45 - a special different action alright
00:47 - that's a goal let's get to it okay so
00:50 - here's our starring scene we similarly
00:52 - have the players sitting around idle
00:53 - there's no input okay so let's start off
00:56 - by making a simple script so in here a
00:58 - new c-sharp script
01:00 - this will be our testing code let's
01:02 - create a testing game object and drag
01:07 - the script onto it okay now in here
01:10 - let's make a friend Roy update and let's
01:14 - capture our mouse clicks so we do it if
01:17 - go into the input and get the mouse
01:19 - button down this function returns true
01:22 - on the very first frame that we press on
01:24 - the mouse button so in here will require
01:27 - an index for the mouse button the left
01:30 - mouse button is on index 0 and the right
01:32 - one on index one so in this case and
01:34 - let's s for the left mouse button so we
01:36 - pass in a 0 so the code in here won't be
01:39 - triggered exactly once when I press on
01:42 - the mouse button so let's just do a
01:44 - simple debug log and say click OK let's
01:49 - see ok here we are with the console and
01:51 - when I press the inlet mouse button
01:53 - if there you go there's our click debug
01:55 - dawa ok so that's how we capture a
01:58 - simple mouse click now let's go back
02:00 - into the code and here in order to make
02:03 - this more fun let's make our character
02:04 - move whenever we click so for that let's
02:07 - add a reference for our player script so
02:09 - a serialize field or in private player
02:13 - reference here in the editor you can see
02:17 - the field so we just drag the player
02:19 - onto it ok now when we click we can go
02:22 - into the player and probably move to
02:25 - function which were moving towards a
02:26 - target position so let's call it with
02:29 - the mouth warm position for that we can
02:32 - grab it from a function in the utilities
02:36 - as always you can download utilities for
02:39 - free from unity karmic calm so with this
02:42 - when we press the left mouse button we
02:43 - should be able to tell the player
02:45 - character to move to the mouse warm
02:46 - position let's see so here we are and
02:50 - when I press and let mouse button if
02:51 - there you go he starts moving to that
02:53 - position he gets there and stops okay
02:55 - great so we have a very simple click
02:58 - being captured now that we have that
03:00 - let's think about exactly what a
03:02 - double-click entails so in essence a
03:04 - double-click is essentially two clicks
03:07 - that are in very quick succession so
03:09 - that means when we click we need to know
03:11 - how long ago the last click what so here
03:14 - in the code let's store the time that
03:16 - will last clicked so up here make a
03:19 - private float for the last click time so
03:24 - this won't store the time when we unless
03:26 - clicked so in order to store that we go
03:28 - in here into our click and we set the
03:31 - last click time to be time time this
03:37 - contains the number of seconds since a
03:38 - start of the game
03:40 - okay so let's S&C exactly what is stored
03:42 - in this variable so for that instead of
03:44 - doing a debug log let's do a CM debug
03:48 - which again part of the code McGee
03:49 - Tony's just to spawn a very nice text
03:53 - pop-up and in that pop-up we say the
03:56 - last play time and then we pass in the
03:58 - time
03:58 - ok so let's test and see what the pop-up
04:02 - says here we are now when I click on the
04:04 - mouse button there Gildan last click was
04:07 - at 2.6 seconds now click again and our
04:09 - test with it 6.3 7.7 and so on so as you
04:13 - can see we are correctly storing the
04:14 - time when the last click happened so
04:17 - since we have the current time whenever
04:19 - we click we can easily calculate the
04:20 - difference between the current time and
04:22 - the previous time so here all we need is
04:25 - to do time duck time - in last click
04:28 - time so this is essentially the time in
04:31 - between clicks
04:35 - now obviously we can't delete this
04:37 - before we set the unless click time and
04:42 - let's see the pop-up okay here we are
04:48 - now let's click and should be the
04:50 - difference between the start of the game
04:52 - testing so we click and there you go
04:54 - six seconds okay now click again now
04:56 - it's only been two seconds since the
04:57 - last click and two seconds and so on
04:59 - okay so now we can use this to check
05:02 - which one is the correct value for
05:04 - testing for double clicks so let's say
05:06 - if I click twice we run quickly and
05:08 - there you go the second one set point
05:09 - one three so double click yeah it's
05:12 - around point one seconds so if we give
05:15 - it a little bit more let's make it point
05:17 - two so if we click within point two
05:19 - seconds we consider that a double click
05:21 - all right let's see so in here we can
05:24 - make a private cons for the double click
05:28 - time which will be point two seconds and
05:32 - then in here it's extremely simple to do
05:35 - our logic all we need is the test if the
05:37 - time since the last click is less than
05:40 - or equal to the double click time then
05:43 - this is a double click and if it's not
05:47 - then we have a normal click okay let's
05:52 - do some pop ups so let's see here we are
06:00 - only to a normal click there it is
06:02 - now we double click and there we go the
06:04 - first one is normal and the second one
06:06 - is double ok so that's pretty much it we
06:08 - have our logic fully working now we
06:11 - already have the player moving to our
06:13 - click position now let's add a special -
06:15 - when we have a double click so here in
06:18 - the code when it's a normal click we
06:20 - tell the player to move to that position
06:21 - and when it's a double click the player
06:26 - also has another function for the - -
06:28 - and we - towards the mouse position so
06:30 - we pass in the same mouse world position
06:33 - okay so when we click we move when we
06:36 - double click we - and that's pretty much
06:38 - it as you can see the player logic is
06:40 - completely separated from our input code
06:42 - so here we are let's move here okay now
06:46 - go in here and do
06:47 - double-click and there you go he starts
06:50 - moving and then does a nice - every time
06:52 - I do a double click so I can move the
06:55 - point around and everything works
06:56 - exactly as intended so just like that we
06:59 - can now capture single clicks to make a
07:01 - certain action and then also check for
07:04 - double clicks to make a special action
07:06 - and that's it
07:08 - as always you can download the project
07:10 - files in Tenley's from in Tacoma com
07:12 - if you liked the video subscribe to the
07:14 - channel for more unity tutorials post
07:16 - any questions you have in the comments
07:18 - and I'll do my best Internet alright see
07:20 - you next time
