With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video I'm going to talk about
00:01 - the steam revenue and stats for my
00:03 - latest game barrel round tycoon the game
00:06 - came out in early September after
00:07 - spending nine months in early access so
00:09 - I'll cover the results of that which so
00:11 - far have been pretty nice let's begin
00:17 - [Music]
00:21 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:25 - you will learn how to make your own
00:26 - games with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:28 - professional indie game developer so if
00:30 - you find the video helpful consider
00:31 - subscribing and yep there it is there's
00:33 - the total number for first month sales
00:35 - for veteran tycoon on Steam the game
00:38 - sold three thousand and seven hundred
00:39 - copies for a total of twenty seven
00:42 - thousand dollars in gross revenue the
00:44 - final total including all the sales in
00:46 - early access is about fifteen thousand
00:49 - copies sold for a gross total of about
00:51 - one hundred and twenty thousand so
00:53 - that's a pretty nice number it's
00:55 - certainly not cuphead or shovelknight
00:56 - but for a solo game developer it's very
00:59 - nice however by itself the number
01:02 - doesn't really tell the whole story so
01:03 - first of all this is gross revenue after
01:05 - taking away steams cut chargebacks
01:08 - refunds and taxes the net amount is
01:10 - quite a bit less than half of that
01:11 - somewhere around fifty K I'm making this
01:15 - video in order to add another sales
01:16 - stats data point into the world having
01:19 - more sales that out there will hopefully
01:20 - help people have a more realistic
01:22 - expectation of what game development is
01:24 - like if you're an aspiring indie dev I
01:26 - would recommend you search around for
01:28 - the various developers that have already
01:30 - published sales stats so you can make a
01:32 - better more informed decision before
01:33 - jumping in so as you may know if you
01:36 - follow this channel my mean job is still
01:38 - making my some of indie games I've been
01:40 - making games on Steam for seven years
01:42 - now with eight games total published
01:44 - covering a variety of genres from action
01:47 - to strategy to management some of my
01:49 - games have been successful and some have
01:51 - been complete flops so that's one of the
01:53 - main reasons why a single game sales
01:55 - number is not really telling the whole
01:57 - story I would say if you want to be
01:59 - successful as an indie game developer
02:01 - and have a long career it is essential
02:03 - to manage your finances wisely I always
02:05 - try to keep enough money in the bank so
02:07 - you can withstand a massive flop because
02:08 - it will happen there's an excellent talk
02:11 - by Jake Burkett of grey alien games
02:13 - which perfectly encapsulates what has
02:15 - also been my experience the tunnel
02:17 - itself is perfect it's called how to
02:19 - survive in game dev for 11 years without
02:21 - a hit my own games have never been hits
02:23 - but I'm still here after seven years
02:25 - thanks to constantly learning adapting
02:27 - and careful risk management
02:29 - so go check out that talk another great
02:33 - one is by Jeff Vogel of spiderweb
02:35 - software which again is a story of a
02:37 - long successful career without any
02:39 - massive heads his business model is to
02:41 - focus on a very very specific niche
02:43 - genre which are old-school RPGs and
02:46 - serve that niche audience as best as
02:47 - possible since it's been in business for
02:50 - so long he also creates remasters of his
02:52 - very own games that's yet another
02:54 - benefit of having a deep bang work over
02:56 - a long career yet another one is cliff
02:59 - Harris from posi tech games he's
03:01 - definitely made some games that you
03:03 - could call hits like democracy 3
03:05 - gratuitous space barons and production
03:07 - line also in business for over ten years
03:10 - and his blog is full of excellent
03:11 - information he also experimented with
03:14 - being an indie publisher and actually
03:16 - published shadow hand which was made by
03:18 - Jake Burkett so if you manage the same
03:21 - business for a long time and keep
03:22 - gathering an audience and Industry
03:24 - contacts that's another potential Avenue
03:26 - you can take and finally I've also
03:29 - written a blog post myself a couple of
03:30 - years ago on my experience as an indie
03:32 - bottom-feeder
03:33 - I wrote that right before I published
03:35 - hammer nights which was my fifth game
03:37 - and in it I talked a lot about my
03:39 - strategy for surviving in this business
03:41 - for the long run I'm still here
03:43 - two years after that so I'd say my
03:45 - strategy is working check out all of
03:47 - those links in the description so here
03:50 - are some stats on the game itself this
03:53 - has been my most complex game by far the
03:56 - game has a total of 90 thousand lines of
03:58 - code so that's quite a bit definitely
04:00 - more than any of my other games I first
04:03 - started working on it in April of last
04:04 - year which was also around the time that
04:06 - I started this channel so that's a total
04:08 - of 17 months of development for a few
04:11 - months I was more focused on channel
04:12 - than the game but for the most part
04:14 - that's working full-time I published the
04:16 - coming soon page on June of 2018 and the
04:19 - game was released into early access on
04:21 - December 10 2018 then finally after 16
04:25 - updates and 9 months in early access the
04:27 - game was fully released on September 2nd
04:29 - 2019
04:30 - begin launched into early access with
04:33 - 6,000 wish lists and around 4,000
04:35 - followers which are pre decent numbers
04:37 - nowadays that is the most important
04:39 - metric for finding success on
04:40 - you need to announce your game as soon
04:42 - as possible and start gathering wishlist
04:44 - and followers right away
04:45 - the way you find success on Steam is by
04:47 - selling a decent number in the very
04:49 - first few days and getting at least over
04:51 - 10 reviews once you do that you're no
04:53 - longer competing with the trash games
04:55 - whether they're only with the other
04:56 - great games so having a large number of
04:59 - followers and wish list will help you
05:00 - achieve that and send out from noise
05:02 - so again these stats for the first month
05:04 - of full release are three thousand and
05:06 - seven hundred copies for a total of
05:08 - twenty seven thousand dollars in gross
05:10 - revenue the phone release was on
05:12 - September 2nd with the early access
05:14 - release in December of last year the
05:16 - final total in all of that time has been
05:18 - about 15,000 copies for a gross total of
05:22 - $120,000 however again do you keep in
05:25 - mind that's the gross total so after
05:27 - taking away steams cut charge bags
05:28 - refunds and taxes the net amount is
05:30 - quite a bit less than half of that
05:31 - somewhere around 50 K for 17 months of
05:35 - work that's a decent amount so I would
05:37 - certainly call this game successful over
05:39 - time
05:39 - I won't slowly discount the game as
05:41 - usual and expect it to keep selling a
05:43 - decent amount for quite a while that's
05:45 - the main reason why right now I've been
05:47 - focusing hard on the channel essentially
05:49 - I have a couple of months to try to make
05:50 - this channel sustainable if I can do
05:52 - that and great I can keep making these
05:54 - videos and providing them for free on
05:56 - the channel if I can't do that then I'll
05:58 - have to quickly get started working on
06:00 - my next game if you like videos and
06:02 - would like to help make that happen you
06:03 - can support the channel by picking up
06:05 - the game bundle on the website that
06:07 - contains 7 of my games with a heavy
06:09 - discount there's a multitude of genres
06:11 - from action strategy and management the
06:14 - only game not included is been erotic
06:16 - hoon since it just came out but you can
06:18 - pick that one up on Steam so with this
06:21 - total number and 17 months of
06:23 - development I would certainly consider
06:24 - this game a success not a massive
06:26 - success but still a nice success here's
06:29 - some quick post-mortem takeaways in
06:31 - terms of what I think went right I would
06:33 - say the genre the idea and the name I
06:35 - first started working on the game as an
06:37 - exploration of AI in a battle royale
06:39 - game
06:40 - so I built a map put some units fighting
06:42 - inside it and found that it was quite
06:43 - fun to watch him fight at the time the
06:46 - battle royale game mode was all the rage
06:47 - so I saw that as a nice marketing
06:49 - opportunity
06:50 - again if you want to make it as an indie
06:52 - dev you really need a very compelling
06:54 - concept so I thought okay but erotic
06:57 - hoon is a very popular genre and my most
06:59 - successful games have been my management
07:00 - games so why don't I try to take the
07:03 - barren ground game mode and applying to
07:05 - a tycoon then we thinking about how to
07:07 - make that concept work I thought about
07:09 - one of the games that consumed my
07:10 - childhood which was wrong agos tycoon
07:12 - and just like that the idea was formed
07:15 - make rollercoaster kun but - achoo ting
07:17 - arenas instead of rollercoaster the
07:19 - player would film the park build the
07:20 - arenas and all the other buildings and
07:22 - the guests would go in queue up shoot
07:24 - each other and have fun finally the name
07:26 - I think was very well chosen you might
07:28 - say that the name varam Rafi Koon sounds
07:30 - very generic which is true but it also
07:32 - very clear only communicates what the
07:34 - game is about which again goes back to
07:36 - how important marketing is nowadays and
07:39 - how you need to make things as easy as
07:41 - possible on yourself it's better to go
07:43 - generic and capture some people's
07:44 - intention in the very first few seconds
07:46 - than to go extremely unique and get lost
07:48 - in all the noise developing the game
07:51 - also went quite well
07:52 - making the queues and managing the
07:54 - buildings was a ton of work but a ton of
07:55 - fun this was a very programming heavy
07:58 - game which means very difficult and
08:00 - complex but programming is the part that
08:02 - I love the most about game development
08:03 - so it was also very compelling to make
08:05 - in terms of what went wrong the only
08:07 - thing I can think of is the time time is
08:10 - extremely valuable for an indie dev and
08:12 - spending 17 months on a single project
08:15 - is way too much the longer you spend on
08:17 - the game the harder it will be for that
08:19 - game to turn a profit
08:20 - part of the reason for the along dev
08:22 - cycle was due to how I was trying to
08:24 - keep this channel running at the same
08:26 - time so that led to me being over word
08:28 - for quite a while which had a serious
08:30 - impact on productivity another part is
08:33 - simply due to the genre again the game
08:35 - is 90 thousand lines of code long so
08:38 - when you're trying to make something
08:39 - that complex it will take some time for
08:41 - my next game I certainly aim for a much
08:43 - shorter dev cycle probably around 6 to 8
08:46 - months which i think is the ideal time
08:48 - for a solo game developer I also plan to
08:51 - document more of that whole process so
08:53 - make sure you're subscribed to the
08:54 - channel so you don't miss out another
08:56 - thing you should keep in mind if your
08:58 - goal is to become a professional indie
08:59 - game developer is to keep yourself
09:01 - mentally saying
09:02 - physically fit that might sound weird
09:04 - but believe me it's very important this
09:06 - is a marathon and not a sprint
09:08 - so don't work yourself to death remember
09:10 - to take frequent breaks and get up from
09:12 - your chair so you can keep doing this
09:13 - for a very long time to come if you'd
09:15 - like to hear my general advice on
09:17 - several topics covering indie game
09:18 - development check out the playlist
09:20 - linked in the description I'm also
09:22 - planning on making a video doing a nice
09:24 - game to have time lapse of building the
09:26 - whole game so stay tuned for that I've
09:28 - done a video just like that for the
09:29 - development of survivor squad and the
09:31 - video came out very nice it shows the
09:34 - game being built from absolutely nothing
09:36 - learning with the prototype and three
09:38 - thousand lines of code later it becomes
09:40 - a proper game there's a link in the
09:41 - description so go check it out let me
09:44 - know in the comments if there's any
09:45 - topic you didn't like me to cover
09:46 - related to someone game development or
09:48 - steam and again if you don't like to
09:50 - play my games you can pick up the
09:51 - discounted game button from the website
09:53 - and get better around tycoon from scene
09:55 - alright so I hope this video was
09:57 - informative and help put out another
09:59 - sales data point into the world so
10:00 - aspiring indie devs can make more
10:02 - informed decisions like the video and
10:05 - subscribe the channel if you don't like
10:06 - to see more content like this cause any
10:08 - questions you have in the comments and
10:09 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to talk about the steam revenue and stats for my latest game barrel round tycoon the game came out in early September after spending nine months in early access so I'll cover the results of that which so far have been pretty nice let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you will learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and yep there it is there's the total number for first month sales for veteran tycoon on Steam the game sold three thousand and seven hundred copies for a total of twenty seven thousand dollars in gross revenue the final total including all the sales in early access is about fifteen thousand copies sold for a gross total of about one hundred and twenty thousand so that's a pretty nice number it's certainly not cuphead or shovelknight but for a solo game developer it's very nice however by itself the number doesn't really tell the whole story so first of all this is gross revenue after taking away steams cut chargebacks refunds and taxes the net amount is quite a bit less than half of that somewhere around fifty K I'm making this video in order to add another sales stats data point into the world having more sales that out there will hopefully help people have a more realistic expectation of what game development is like if you're an aspiring indie dev I would recommend you search around for the various developers that have already published sales stats so you can make a better more informed decision before jumping in so as you may know if you follow this channel my mean job is still making my some of indie games I've been making games on Steam for seven years now with eight games total published covering a variety of genres from action to strategy to management some of my games have been successful and some have been complete flops so that's one of the main reasons why a single game sales number is not really telling the whole story I would say if you want to be successful as an indie game developer and have a long career it is essential to manage your finances wisely I always try to keep enough money in the bank so you can withstand a massive flop because it will happen there's an excellent talk by Jake Burkett of grey alien games which perfectly encapsulates what has also been my experience the tunnel itself is perfect it's called how to survive in game dev for 11 years without a hit my own games have never been hits but I'm still here after seven years thanks to constantly learning adapting and careful risk management so go check out that talk another great one is by Jeff Vogel of spiderweb software which again is a story of a long successful career without any massive heads his business model is to focus on a very very specific niche genre which are oldschool RPGs and serve that niche audience as best as possible since it's been in business for so long he also creates remasters of his very own games that's yet another benefit of having a deep bang work over a long career yet another one is cliff Harris from posi tech games he's definitely made some games that you could call hits like democracy 3 gratuitous space barons and production line also in business for over ten years and his blog is full of excellent information he also experimented with being an indie publisher and actually published shadow hand which was made by Jake Burkett so if you manage the same business for a long time and keep gathering an audience and Industry contacts that's another potential Avenue you can take and finally I've also written a blog post myself a couple of years ago on my experience as an indie bottomfeeder I wrote that right before I published hammer nights which was my fifth game and in it I talked a lot about my strategy for surviving in this business for the long run I'm still here two years after that so I'd say my strategy is working check out all of those links in the description so here are some stats on the game itself this has been my most complex game by far the game has a total of 90 thousand lines of code so that's quite a bit definitely more than any of my other games I first started working on it in April of last year which was also around the time that I started this channel so that's a total of 17 months of development for a few months I was more focused on channel than the game but for the most part that's working fulltime I published the coming soon page on June of 2018 and the game was released into early access on December 10 2018 then finally after 16 updates and 9 months in early access the game was fully released on September 2nd 2019 begin launched into early access with 6,000 wish lists and around 4,000 followers which are pre decent numbers nowadays that is the most important metric for finding success on you need to announce your game as soon as possible and start gathering wishlist and followers right away the way you find success on Steam is by selling a decent number in the very first few days and getting at least over 10 reviews once you do that you're no longer competing with the trash games whether they're only with the other great games so having a large number of followers and wish list will help you achieve that and send out from noise so again these stats for the first month of full release are three thousand and seven hundred copies for a total of twenty seven thousand dollars in gross revenue the phone release was on September 2nd with the early access release in December of last year the final total in all of that time has been about 15,000 copies for a gross total of $120,000 however again do you keep in mind that's the gross total so after taking away steams cut charge bags refunds and taxes the net amount is quite a bit less than half of that somewhere around 50 K for 17 months of work that's a decent amount so I would certainly call this game successful over time I won't slowly discount the game as usual and expect it to keep selling a decent amount for quite a while that's the main reason why right now I've
