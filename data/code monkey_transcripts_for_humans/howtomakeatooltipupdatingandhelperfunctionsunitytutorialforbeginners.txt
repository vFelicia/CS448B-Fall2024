00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - make a tool tip in unity we're going to
00:04 - add the ability to update our tool tip
00:06 - tanks dynamically let's begin
00:10 - so this is our scene and this is our
00:13 - taunted now sometimes you might want to
00:15 - display some dynamic text inside your
00:17 - taunted like for example to display some
00:19 - sort of cooldown or a cost of doing
00:21 - inaction
00:22 - so in those cases it's very useful to
00:24 - have a tooltip that updates in real time
00:26 - rather than just a simple string so for
00:29 - testing we're going to add a sort of
00:31 - cool down on our attack and we want to
00:33 - display it inside our assaultive so
00:35 - let's go to the window code and here is
00:38 - some basic call down code as you can see
00:40 - it's a simple float when we click on the
00:42 - button it increases the flow to five
00:44 - seconds and it goes down by top the time
00:46 - on every update so we want to display
00:48 - this attack come down after the attack
00:50 - here in this tooltip so for that what's
00:53 - going to the tooltip class and in here
00:55 - down on the show top function we're
00:58 - going to make another private void show
01:00 - tooltip however instead of receiving
01:02 - just a basic string we're going to
01:04 - receive a func which returns a string so
01:07 - let's call this get total tip strength
01:09 - pump a func is just a delegate which
01:13 - returns a certain object type so in this
01:15 - case a string so let's store this as a
01:17 - member variable so go up here and since
01:22 - we have two shows on tips let's expand
01:25 - this code into its own function so a
01:27 - private void set text and here we're
01:31 - going to set the text and actually set
01:34 - the background size and we call it from
01:36 - here and also from here now the total
01:40 - string is the returning results from
01:42 - this Punk and in order to keep our code
01:46 - simple let's make it so that this
01:48 - function also goes through this one so
01:54 - just like that we still have this
01:56 - version of our function which takes a
01:58 - simple string and then calls this
01:59 - function by sending it a simple func
02:01 - which just returns this static string so
02:04 - this isn't necessarily the best way in
02:06 - terms of performance but since we
02:08 - normally only have one tooltip that is
02:09 - usually not a problem and this way our
02:12 - code is easier to follow so now on our
02:14 - update in here we set the tags using our
02:18 - set text function and now for the total
02:20 - strain we're going to use the get
02:22 - tooltip string func
02:23 - we call that function so on every update
02:27 - we're going to set the text based on
02:28 - whatever this function returns so our
02:31 - code should be working for updating our
02:32 - tooltip now we can go back to the window
02:35 - code and in here when we show it on tip
02:37 - instead of sending just a basic string
02:39 - let's send a func which will return a
02:41 - string so it won't say attack and then
02:44 - the attack called out all right so let's
02:49 - test okay so here is the window on the
02:51 - other stonework and if I go over the
02:53 - attack you can see a tag with a
02:55 - cool-down zero and now if I click on it
02:57 - yep you can see that the attack has been
03:00 - set they come down to five seconds and
03:02 - it is updating on every frame and all
03:04 - the others again still work as normal
03:06 - static tooltips so again click and
03:08 - everything works okay
03:09 - great so now that we have our tooltip
03:12 - updating which is very useful let's also
03:14 - add some more functions to make our code
03:16 - easier to use so here are some helper
03:18 - functions so a public static void call
03:21 - it add tulta and we're going to add on
03:24 - tip to a transform so here we simply do
03:28 - the same thing that we were doing in
03:30 - here but instead of having all this code
03:32 - in our window we're simply going to have
03:33 - a helper function in there so we can
03:35 - actually copy this
03:46 - and on the button UI class I have a
03:49 - separate action which are normally used
03:51 - just for the tooltips so the mouse over
03:54 - one stone tip and mouse out one stone
03:56 - tip this way I don't ruin whatever
03:59 - behavior the button has on the normal
04:01 - Mouse over so again these are humper
04:03 - functions for how I set up my buttons
04:05 - using this button UI class but if you
04:07 - are using something else just modify it
04:09 - in here also as another helper function
04:21 - we can also create an extension method
04:35 - so in here we have two nice humper
04:38 - functions depending on what pattern you
04:39 - prefer to use so now we can go back to
04:41 - the window and clean up all of this code
04:44 - and simply do the transform dot at
04:48 - tooltip and this is one way we can use
04:53 - this is using the extension method and
05:01 - here we are using the static method so
05:03 - using whatever pattern you prefer you
05:05 - can see that our tooltip class is now
05:07 - very easy to use so it's going to test
05:09 - to make sure that it works and yep there
05:12 - it is all the tooltips are working this
05:13 - one is working and yep there's the cool
05:15 - down and this one is working which has
05:17 - the other method and just like that
05:19 - everything is working for it so there
05:22 - you have it we took our tool tip and add
05:23 - an option to update it on tip during
05:25 - runtime we also added the humper
05:27 - functions to make our class very easy to
05:29 - use in the next video we're going to
05:31 - make a tooltip warning as always you can
05:33 - download the project found the newtonís
05:35 - from unity code monkey calm if you have
05:37 - any questions post them in the comments
05:39 - and I'll do my best answer them
05:40 - subscribe for more videos and I'll see
05:42 - you next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're continuing to make a tool tip in unity we're going to add the ability to update our tool tip tanks dynamically let's begin so this is our
