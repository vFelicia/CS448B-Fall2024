00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for february 2021
00:06 - my going with these videos is to
00:08 - highlight what can be done with the
00:09 - engine so you know the only limit is
00:10 - really just your own imagination
00:12 - all of these games are uniquely
00:13 - impressive and showcase the power of the
00:15 - engine in tons of different scenarios so
00:16 - this list is in no particular order
00:18 - except for the number one game that is
00:20 - my personal pick of the month
00:21 - also there's links in the description
00:23 - for the games those are affiliate links
00:24 - so if you use them it's the same for icu
00:26 - and you'll also be supporting the
00:27 - channel
00:27 - alright so let's go starting off at
00:29 - number 10 here is rustler
00:31 - this one was actually being promoted
00:33 - under a slightly different name
00:34 - it was named grand theft horse i'm
00:36 - guessing they changed it to avoid
00:38 - potential copyright issues but that name
00:40 - says everything about what this game
00:41 - tries to do
00:42 - think grand theft auto but in a
00:44 - different world that's definitely a very
00:46 - appealing concept
00:47 - they lean into the absurdity of the
00:49 - concept with lots of pop culture
00:50 - references
00:51 - crazy characters and silly quests so you
00:53 - can ride horses use medieval weapons
00:55 - escape the medieval cops fighting
00:57 - tournaments and so on
00:58 - visually it doesn't look very good it
01:00 - features a top-down perspective with
01:02 - some really good looking assets and
01:03 - lighting effects
01:04 - as i said it's a really compelling
01:06 - concept however the reviews are barely
01:08 - hanging on between mixed and mostly
01:09 - positive
01:10 - but the game is in early access so i
01:12 - really hope they managed to build upon
01:14 - this base and improve it
01:15 - it does have a free demo if you want to
01:17 - try it out next up we have fights in
01:19 - tight spaces
01:20 - this is a really stylish action deck
01:22 - building turn-based fighting game
01:24 - right away you see a very unique look
01:26 - the player character and the enemies are
01:28 - easily identifiable
01:29 - you have to position yourself correctly
01:31 - and use the right moves you have at your
01:33 - disposal customize your deck with all
01:35 - kinds of cards and actions you can take
01:37 - select the ones you want and upgrade
01:38 - them as you go along features daily
01:40 - challenges and leaderboards for you to
01:42 - try to beat
01:43 - also i love the name it's really very
01:44 - descriptive i've had my eye on this one
01:47 - for a while
01:47 - i quite like the concept of a turn-based
01:50 - melee combat game with cards
01:51 - and the visuals are perfect for standing
01:53 - out in today's world i'm thinking i
01:55 - might pick this one up as my next game
01:57 - design lessons video i haven't played a
01:59 - card game in a long time so i'm
02:00 - interested in learning more about the
02:01 - genre

02:05 - thing but really does help
02:07 - thanks then for something a bit more
02:08 - chill here is tastemaker restaurant
02:10 - simulator as the name implies you manage
02:12 - a restaurant
02:13 - start with a small empty plot of land
02:15 - and start building a simple restaurant
02:17 - then as you make more cash you can buy
02:19 - more land to expand and grow your
02:21 - restaurant you can create a custom menu
02:23 - to offer to your guests
02:24 - just make sure you pick the right dishes
02:26 - at the right price or you won't suffer
02:28 - the consequences
02:29 - your guests also want more than just
02:31 - food so make sure you decorate your
02:33 - restaurant accordingly
02:34 - and of course hygiene is of the utmost
02:36 - importance if you don't clean up then
02:38 - rats may appear which will definitely
02:40 - make your guests very unhappy

02:44 - looking for a management game on a tight
02:46 - scale then check this one out
02:47 - then for some vr here is revolver 3
02:51 - it's a really great name it's a single
02:53 - and multiplayer game
02:54 - staged in a robotic version of the wild
02:56 - west

02:59 - play some minigames and participate in

03:04 - russian roulette or play shoot the
03:06 - bottle

03:27 - it's a physics based realistic sword
03:29 - fighting dueling game set in the 17th
03:31 - century
03:32 - the focus is really on physically
03:34 - accurate actions
03:35 - the swords actually clash using physics
03:37 - and the characters move
03:38 - using super realistic motion captured
03:41 - fencing techniques
03:42 - all the damage is calculated based on
03:44 - where the sword actually lands
03:45 - to win you must use proper timing

03:51 - characters also look great lots of
03:53 - physically accurate clothes and hair
03:55 - swaying around
03:56 - it really is a very unique concept and
03:58 - based on the overwhelmingly
04:00 - positive number of reviews then it seems
04:02 - like it's very well executed
04:03 - i'd love to try this one out just to see
04:05 - how they implemented all these controls
04:07 - if you're looking for some mysterious
04:09 - story then here is nuts

04:26 - a mystery and find out what is really
04:28 - going on in the forest

04:40 - video then you know that for my very
04:41 - first steam game i actually wanted to

04:45 - in the end my skills at the time weren't
04:46 - good enough so i went with a zombie
04:48 - theme instead
04:49 - but i'm still a huge fan of this theme
04:51 - and this looks like a great new entry in
04:53 - the genre
04:54 - it's got some high quality realistic
04:55 - visuals combined with simple icons for
04:57 - the characters

05:10 - and more choose your point of entry and
05:12 - master each mission
05:13 - from hostage rescue missions to
05:15 - arresting a gang boss or stopping a
05:17 - casino heist

05:25 - can play with up to 4 friends or give it
05:27 - a try being solo

05:51 - it's got great visuals and lighting
05:52 - effects that really emphasize the
05:54 - day and night times it's a simple
05:56 - concept but based on the number of very
