00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and if you're a fan of low poly assets
00:04 - and great news the city Store is having
00:05 - their birthday sale with almost
00:07 - everything at 50 off apparently they're
00:09 - nine years old with all that time they
00:11 - have definitely built a huge Library all
00:12 - in their signature sound personally I
00:14 - really like the style for example I'm
00:16 - using the Sci-Fi runs pack in my
00:18 - upcoming steam game thing Guardians go
00:20 - ahead and edit your wishlist with all
00:21 - these packs you can build essentially an
00:23 - infinite amount of game you can use them
00:24 - in any type any genre for example I made
00:27 - a fun weapon attachment system using the
00:29 - military pack that pack comes with much
00:31 - more pieces so I made a system to put
00:33 - them all together you can download the
00:34 - project files for that one another mini
00:36 - game that also made on the last sale was
00:38 - the drag racing minigame this one was
00:40 - made using their street racer pack again
00:42 - this one also has unloadable project
00:43 - files then last year on another sale I
00:45 - also made some three interesting
00:47 - minigames I made an RTS pack with the
00:49 - Sci-Fi space pack then I use the farm
00:52 - pack to make a nice farming mini game
00:53 - and then I use the town pack to make a
00:56 - driving game inspired by Crazy Taxi also
00:58 - in my turn-based strategy course I use
00:59 - prototype pack this is a great base pack
01:02 - which is actually pretty cheap and
01:03 - lightning pies is perfect for any kind
01:05 - of prototype so as you can see you can
01:07 - really take any of these packs and build
01:08 - all kinds of games pretty much every
01:10 - single acid is currently a half price
01:12 - The Only Exception is here the Cyber
01:14 - City this one just came out two weeks
01:15 - ago so this one is only 10 off but
01:17 - everything else is 50 off like for
01:19 - example the casino I think this one came
01:21 - out two months ago and it's on fifty
01:22 - percent off for the first time another
01:24 - recent one that I also think it's at 50
01:25 - off for the first time is the Elven
01:27 - Realms pack really excellent huge pack
01:29 - that is perfect for making something
01:30 - medieval fantasy maybe something
01:32 - inspired by Lord of the Rings then for
01:34 - the standard packs like for example the
01:36 - fantasy Kingdom I'm a huge fan of this
01:37 - one I love medieval stuff for something
01:39 - more modern you have over here the
01:41 - apocalypse pack or perhaps get the shops
01:43 - back now every time I look at this one
01:45 - it makes me want to make a sort of
01:46 - multi-coon game this is also the one
01:48 - that I use in the how to pick up objects
01:50 - video the ancient empires pack is
01:52 - another excellent one if you want to
01:54 - make something inspired by 300 or maybe
01:55 - tomorrow Rome then this would be perfect
01:57 - I use this pack in the camera controller
01:59 - video you the modular fantasy Hero
02:01 - characters also a great one if you want
02:03 - to create an infinite amount of
02:04 - characters I use that one in the
02:06 - character customization video and the
02:08 - horror mentioned pack would be great for
02:09 - some horror I use this one in the v
02:11 - Rising sunlight mechanic video so lots
02:13 - of stuff to build lots of things then
02:15 - they also have some other packs with a
02:17 - slightly different sound it's their
02:18 - simple series these are quite a bit more
02:20 - blocking more on low poly but still
02:22 - definitely a fun style these are all
02:24 - pretty cheap and have tons and tons of
02:25 - props or if you want something in their
02:27 - regular style but with a great value
02:28 - then you've got all these packs all of
02:31 - these are very cheap for the amount of
02:32 - assets that they have for example the
02:34 - farming pack is great I made that
02:35 - farming minigame with this pack so this
02:37 - would be great if you want to experiment
02:38 - with making something kind of like
02:40 - stardew Valley the Battleground pack is
02:42 - another great General shooting pack I've
02:44 - used this one in my third person shooter
02:46 - video the environment packs are all
02:47 - great if you just need some pre-made
02:49 - Maps then the particle effects pack is
02:51 - another great one that is also pretty
02:52 - cheap has quite a lot of particle
02:54 - effects which I've used in a bunch of
02:55 - different projects and the office pack
02:57 - could be great for some kind of
02:58 - management game since you you can see
03:00 - tons of variety at every price point go
