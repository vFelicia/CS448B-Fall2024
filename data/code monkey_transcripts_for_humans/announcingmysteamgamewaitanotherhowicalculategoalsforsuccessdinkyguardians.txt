00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here is my next team game called
00:04 - dinky Guardians it's a fun Co-op
00:06 - multiplayer game where you play as a
00:07 - guardian in a world where there are some
00:09 - tiny defenseless creatures called
00:11 - dinkies here is the quick 40 second
00:13 - trailer and afterwards I'm going to
00:14 - answer the question that you're probably
00:15 - thinking about and talk about my goals
00:17 - with this game
00:24 - [Music]
00:34 - ways
00:37 - [Music]
00:56 - [Music]
01:00 - foreign
01:06 - foreign
01:09 - game you must explore the world together
01:12 - some food and resources to keep the
01:13 - dinkies alive build a colony set up
01:15 - machines see other resources and feed
01:17 - them although there are also some
01:18 - zombies and all they want to do is eat
01:20 - some dinky so you need to keep them safe
01:22 - build your defenses automate resource
01:24 - Gathering and survive do all of that
01:26 - while either playing Solo or with some
01:28 - friends check out the steam page Link in
01:30 - the description and add it to your
01:31 - wishlist now let me address the elephant
01:33 - in the room if you are a regular viewer
01:35 - on this channel then you might know that
01:37 - I have already announced another steam
01:39 - game several months ago that one
01:40 - Liberation so it might seem strange why
01:42 - I'm now announcing another steam game
01:44 - before finishing that one first of all
01:46 - the answer is sudden World Liberation is
01:47 - not canceled I'm still very excited
01:49 - about that game and definitely want to
01:51 - complete it I think the final game will
01:52 - be really awesome but while it is not
01:55 - canceled it is definitely on a short
01:56 - Hiatus let me tell you my reasons and my
01:58 - new plan hopefully it won't be
02:00 - interesting to you as an indie game
02:01 - developer and this video is also a nice
02:03 - practical example of how volatile in the
02:05 - game development is and how you must
02:07 - always be ready to adapt even when you
02:09 - already have quite a lot of experience
02:11 - just like I do basically going with
02:13 - tunnel run Liberation was launched it in
02:15 - the summer of this year but as you might
02:17 - also know recently I spent three months
02:18 - working on two free complete courses I
02:21 - love making those and I'm really happy
02:23 - the response has been really positive
02:24 - everyone seems to really enjoy how much
02:26 - they learn from them however naturally
02:28 - as I was working on those three courses
02:30 - I did not have the time to work on
02:31 - turnover Liberation that game is really
02:34 - complex it has tons of interesting
02:35 - interconnected systems so it's not
02:38 - something that I think that I can build
02:39 - in just two or three months so because
02:41 - of that I have to delay my original
02:43 - launch date possibly to the end of this
02:45 - year or maybe even Beyond although I
02:47 - really really want to publish a steam
02:49 - game this year my lesson was in 2019 so
02:51 - it's been way too long also one very
02:54 - important thing about how to find
02:55 - success on Steam is you need to make
02:57 - sure you participate in a steam Festival
02:59 - these are excellent events that happen
03:01 - several times a year where players can
03:03 - play tons of free demos they are great
03:05 - for finding new players and Gathering
03:06 - wish lists to make sure you have a
03:08 - successful launch you can only
03:09 - participate in one scene Festival so you
03:11 - should choose the one just before
03:12 - release related to that the next team
03:15 - festival is in June and the way that
03:17 - scene works is you need to sign up and
03:18 - register for the festival in advance in
03:21 - this case the registration deadline for
03:22 - the June Festival was in mid-march so
03:24 - basically by mid-march I had to decide
03:27 - if I was going to launch Star Wars
03:28 - Liberation around July August or not and
03:31 - with delay caused by the free courses I
03:33 - don't think that I can hit that date
03:34 - after that the next team festival is in
03:37 - October if I were to participate in that
03:39 - one I could then launch a game in a
03:41 - small window in November basically you
03:43 - don't want to launch when there's a
03:44 - steam sale so I would have to avoid the
03:46 - Halloween sale and the end of the year
03:48 - sales which means there's a very short
03:50 - window around that time so most likely
03:52 - if I did attend the October Festival I
03:54 - would probably only be able to launch a
03:55 - game in January or February and like I
03:58 - said I really really want to launch a
03:59 - Sim game this year so I was not happy
04:01 - with that plan as I was looking at my
04:03 - options I was thinking what could I
04:05 - possibly do again I had to decide all of
04:07 - this very quickly before the scene first
04:09 - registration date in mid-march and at
04:11 - that same time while I was working on
04:13 - the free multiplayer course I really
04:14 - enjoyed working with the tool set and
04:16 - thinking about multiplayer so the
04:18 - solution that I came up with was why
04:19 - don't I make a short and simple
04:21 - multiplayer game something that I can
04:22 - launch this year and have more time for
04:24 - developing total learn Liberation and
04:26 - that's exactly what I did I very quickly
04:28 - got to work on coming up with an
04:30 - interesting design I wanted something
04:31 - multiplayer Co-op casual fun but I
04:34 - didn't want to make something super
04:35 - generic so I added some Colony building
04:38 - some Automation and some defense
04:40 - elements I think design will be pretty
04:42 - fun to play the game that I can picture
04:43 - in my head is pretty interesting and
04:45 - again the goal is make the game short
04:47 - and sweet make it quickly to launch this
04:49 - year so I very quickly set up the scene
04:52 - page it needed to be public in order to
04:54 - register for the June scene Festival I
04:56 - wrote description created the new ENT
04:58 - project thankfully I did manage to do
05:00 - all of that on time even though I was
05:01 - super busy finishing up the multiplayer
05:03 - course I published the page and did
05:05 - manage to register for the festival so
05:07 - just like I did when I Liberation here
05:10 - my goals for this project even though
05:12 - this is a shorter project I still wanted
05:14 - to be successful so I have the same
05:16 - Target monthly income goal of around two
05:18 - thousand dollars if I launch a game in
05:20 - July that means four months of
05:21 - development so a goal of eight thousand
05:24 - dollars net revenue this is net not
05:26 - gross revenue I covered the math behind
05:28 - that difference in another video
05:29 - assuming net revenue is about 40 percent
05:32 - of gross revenue that means I need a
05:34 - total of twenty thousand dollars gross
05:35 - based on this I can come up with a price
05:37 - to see how many copies I need to hit
05:39 - price point is actually really tricky
05:41 - one very difficult thing about making
05:43 - multiplayer games is you need players to
05:45 - actually play them so for this it really
05:47 - helps to sell more copies at the same
05:49 - time the general recommendation is you
05:51 - really shouldn't price your games under
05:53 - ten dollars the game will have a single
05:55 - player component but still I want to
05:56 - make sure there's enough people playing
05:57 - that someone can play with strangers so
05:59 - honestly right now I'm not internally
06:00 - sure on the price point perhaps I'll put
06:02 - it at just five dollars maybe 10 I'm
06:04 - really not sure for this estimate let's
06:06 - pick a number in the middle so let's say
06:08 - seven dollars that means in order to hit
06:10 - the goal it needs to sell about 3000
06:12 - copies now that we know this number we
06:13 - can go to the next step which is
06:15 - wishlist they are an excellent predictor
06:17 - of sales if you're making a game that
06:19 - you want to be successful you must spend
06:21 - time and effort together as many
06:22 - wishlists as you can before launch so
06:24 - let me take this time to ask you to
06:25 - click the link in the description and
06:27 - add the game to your wish list the more
06:28 - wishlist you have the more steam
06:30 - promotes your game even if the people on
06:31 - wish listing aren't really interested in
06:33 - picking up the game at launch even
06:35 - without that more wish lists is always
06:36 - better but of course hopefully those
06:38 - wishlists won't convert into some sales
06:40 - the general conversion math is around 20
06:42 - on week one if you're wondering where
06:44 - this number comes from it's from the two
06:46 - excellent game marketing sources that I
06:48 - covered in my marketing video the
06:49 - newsletter game discover Co and Chris
06:51 - Zukowski from how to Market your game so
06:53 - the math is usually around 20 conversion
06:55 - on week one and usually sales for year
06:57 - one are three to five times week one so
07:00 - putting all of that together let's say
07:02 - the goal is 1 000 copies sold on week
07:04 - one which would mean three to five
07:06 - thousand copies sold on year one with a
07:08 - 20 conversion rate it means 5000
07:10 - wishlist needed that sounds like a
07:12 - relatively achievable goals although
07:14 - wishlists also have a sort of soft goal
07:16 - around 10 000 that's usually the amount
07:18 - that you should have so let's aim for a
07:20 - 10K wishlist if I hit that I should be
07:22 - able to get 1000 sales on week one
07:24 - funnily enough these are actually the
07:26 - exact same goals that I set for
07:27 - tournament Liberation simply because
07:29 - this game will have a lower price point
07:31 - but also a shorter death cycle it will
07:33 - have less time to get those wishlists
07:35 - since release is meant to be just four
07:36 - months from now so it will be very
07:38 - tricky to hit 10K but hopefully the demo
07:40 - is great and the festival really helps
07:42 - with all the math on here are all of the
07:44 - main goals once you game in July of 23
07:47 - launch with 10 000 wishlists have those
07:49 - wish lists converted into 1 000 week one
07:52 - copy sold and 3 000 year one copy sold
07:54 - do that in order to hit twenty thousand
07:56 - dollars in gross revenue and eight
07:58 - thousand dollars in net revenue which
08:00 - would equal around two thousand dollars
08:01 - per month development which would be a
08:03 - decent amount now let's split this into
08:05 - three scenarios so this one is the good
08:07 - scenario half of these amount would be
08:09 - the bare minimum scenario and that one
08:11 - would be the great scenario these are my
08:13 - goals with this game and this is my
08:15 - current plan make this small short and
08:17 - sweet game and watch it this year then
08:19 - leave the more complex game for the next
08:21 - year just for fun you can go watch a
08:23 - video announcing total one Liberation to
08:25 - see how these goals compare with those
08:26 - spelling alert they are basically
08:28 - exactly the same
08:30 - another reason for making this small
08:31 - scope project for Tone Room Liberation I
08:34 - really want that game to be very
08:35 - successful I want the final game to come
08:37 - out really awesome I think the game ID
08:39 - really does have a lot of potential if I
08:41 - can execute it correctly in order to
08:43 - ensure that I really want to make sure I
08:44 - remember everything required for a
08:46 - successful scene launch so that's
08:48 - another reason for making this game I
08:50 - would like to completely in lower 6
08:51 - project in order to be better prepared
08:53 - for a much bigger project I'll win some
08:55 - bonus info for those of you still
08:56 - watching the video an update on the
08:58 - Eternal World Liberation wishlist they
09:00 - are currently a bit above the 5K Mark
09:02 - you can also see the phone remote they
09:04 - are currently at about 700 which makes
09:06 - for a phone work tuitionless radio of
09:08 - about eight usually it's around 10 or
09:10 - more I guess since I have this channel
09:12 - there's more people interested in
09:14 - following the game than usual so that's
09:15 - just some fun stats and all of this is
09:18 - my new plan I hope that by being
09:19 - transparent about my plans and how they
09:21 - change over time I hope this gives you a
09:23 - better view of what it's like to be an
09:24 - indie game developer and how you need to
09:26 - adapt whatever happens probably most of
09:28 - you don't have a YouTube channel that
09:30 - takes time away from your game but you
09:32 - probably do have a regular job that does
09:34 - pretty much the exact same thing so
09:35 - hopefully this video helped you see an
09:37 - example for how while things might not
09:39 - go exactly the way you want them to you
09:41 - can always adapt alright so now I got to
09:43 - get to work on this game four months
09:44 - isn't a lot of time and I have a lot to
09:46 - do stay tuned for some interesting
09:48 - devlogs and since this is a multiplayer
09:50 - game I'll also be doing some play tests
09:51 - so stay tuned for that again please
09:53 - check the link in the description and
09:54 - add the game to your wish list thank you
09:56 - for watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here is my next team game called dinky Guardians it's a fun Coop multiplayer game where you play as a guardian in a world where there are some tiny defenseless creatures called dinkies here is the quick 40 second trailer and afterwards I'm going to answer the question that you're probably thinking about and talk about my goals with this game ways foreign foreign game you must explore the world together some food and resources to keep the dinkies alive build a colony set up machines see other resources and feed them although there are also some zombies and all they want to do is eat some dinky so you need to keep them safe build your defenses automate resource Gathering and survive do all of that while either playing Solo or with some friends check out the steam page Link in the description and add it to your wishlist now let me address the elephant in the room if you are a regular viewer on this channel then you might know that I have already announced another steam game several months ago that one Liberation so it might seem strange why I'm now announcing another steam game before finishing that one first of all the answer is sudden World Liberation is not canceled I'm still very excited about that game and definitely want to complete it I think the final game will be really awesome but while it is not canceled it is definitely on a short Hiatus let me tell you my reasons and my new plan hopefully it won't be interesting to you as an indie game developer and this video is also a nice practical example of how volatile in the game development is and how you must always be ready to adapt even when you already have quite a lot of experience just like I do basically going with tunnel run Liberation was launched it in the summer of this year but as you might also know recently I spent three months working on two free complete courses I love making those and I'm really happy the response has been really positive everyone seems to really enjoy how much they learn from them however naturally as I was working on those three courses I did not have the time to work on turnover Liberation that game is really complex it has tons of interesting interconnected systems so it's not something that I think that I can build in just two or three months so because of that I have to delay my original launch date possibly to the end of this year or maybe even Beyond although I really really want to publish a steam game this year my lesson was in 2019 so it's been way too long also one very important thing about how to find success on Steam is you need to make sure you participate in a steam Festival these are excellent events that happen several times a year where players can play tons

working on the free multiplayer course I really enjoyed working with the tool set and thinking about multiplayer so the solution that I came up with was why don't I make a short and simple multiplayer

on the price point perhaps I'll put it at just five dollars maybe 10 I'm really not sure for this estimate let's pick a number in the middle so let's say seven dollars that means in order to hit the goal it needs to sell about 3000 copies now that we know this number we can go to the next step which is wishlist they are an excellent predictor of sales if you're making a game that you want to be successful you must spend time and effort together as many wishlists as you can before launch so let me take this time to ask you to click the link in the description and add the game to your wish list the more wishlist you have the more steam promotes your game even if the people on wish listing aren't really interested in picking up the game at launch even without that more wish lists is always better but of course hopefully those wishlists won't convert into some sales the general conversion math is around 20 on week one if you're wondering where this number comes from it's from the two excellent game marketing sources that I covered in my marketing video the newsletter game discover Co and Chris Zukowski from how to Market your game so the math is usually around 20 conversion on week one and usually sales for year one are three to five times week one so putting all of that together let's say the goal is 1 000 copies sold on week one which would mean three to five thousand copies sold on year one with a 20 conversion rate it means 5000 wishlist needed that sounds like a relatively achievable goals although wishlists also have a sort of soft goal around 10 000 that's usually the amount that you should have so let's aim for a 10K wishlist if I hit that I should be able to get 1000 sales on week one funnily enough these are actually the exact same goals that I set
