00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod Maki
00:02 - unity's annual unite conference has just
00:04 - happened in Amsterdam lots of news and
00:06 - announcements about the future Unity
00:08 - sponsored this video and they invited me
00:09 - over to check out the conference this
00:11 - was actually the first conference since
00:12 - I started using a camera in my videos so
00:14 - a bunch of people recognize me thank you
00:16 - all for being so nice it's always great
00:17 - to meet people in real life who enjoy
00:19 - watching and learning from my videos so
00:20 - really thank you my voice is still quite
00:22 - a bit messed up from talking to so many
00:24 - people these events are definitely
00:26 - extremely intense although always a lot
00:28 - of fun now the main thing is the keynote
00:30 - so here's an overview I originally
00:32 - wanted to do a super short summary but
00:34 - there's actually quite a lot to talk
00:35 - about first important thing is honestly
00:37 - just the general sentiment given
00:38 - everything that's happened in the past
00:40 - two months so they spoke a lot about a
00:42 - focus on stability performance visuals
00:44 - and really just tightening everything
00:46 - there are some interesting new
00:47 - announcements but also a lot of just
00:48 - improving upon everything that already
00:50 - exists which is what most people have
00:52 - been calling for so I think that's a
00:53 - good thing the message coming from new
00:55 - CEO was indeed one of refocusing Unity
00:57 - on its core focusing on games and making
00:59 - the the engine the best it can be with a
01:01 - great focus on community I think that's
01:03 - a great sentiment and I truly hope that
01:05 - he can bring his Community Focus vision
01:07 - for Unity to life honestly for me
01:09 - personally right now the main thing I
01:10 - want from imunity is really just
01:12 - stability meaning stability in the
01:13 - company itself I'm just hoping for some
01:16 - calm and no new scandals in the next few
01:17 - months thankfully despite the fact that
01:19 - he only got the job two months ago I
01:21 - would say the keynote already reflected
01:22 - part of that Community Focus Vision
01:25 - there's lots of improvements tons of
01:26 - downloadable samples and a handful of
01:28 - tools so pretty much everything that
01:30 - everyone wants one of the main things is
01:32 - how they announce a new naming scheme
01:34 - the next major version of unity instead
01:36 - of being called the 23 LTS will simply
01:38 - be called Unity 6 I remember when they
01:40 - changed from Unity 5 to Unity 2017 and
01:43 - now apparently they're going back to
01:44 - normal non-year numbers now the version
01:46 - name is actually something that I've
01:47 - given my feedback on several times the
01:49 - year version is usually one year behind
01:51 - meaning right now in the year 23 the
01:53 - version you should be using is the 22
01:55 - LTS but for some people especially
01:57 - beginners just starting to learn they
01:58 - feel that the 22 version is outdated
02:00 - since we're already in 23 so they end up
02:02 - using a tech version which is not
02:03 - necessarily the most stable and end up
02:05 - with a frustrating experience my
02:07 - feedback that I've said to un many times
02:09 - was simply increase the version number
02:10 - by one but maybe this change just using
02:12 - a number that has nothing to do with the
02:13 - year maybe this will also help that
02:15 - problem along with the new naming scheme
02:17 - they're also apparently pushing back on
02:18 - the release by a little bit usually the
02:20 - LTS version comes around in March and
02:22 - for next year Unity will have a beta out
02:25 - in March so I'm guessing that the full
02:26 - release will be out in something like
02:28 - September again for this I'm hoping that
02:30 - it means they are really focusing on
02:31 - stability so hopefully this new release
02:33 - Cadence should be a good thing oh and
02:36 - also the 23.2 version is out right now
02:38 - then the most impactful part of the
02:40 - keynote for me was how they showcase
02:42 - some great graphics improvements for
02:43 - both urp and agrp they showcased a truly
02:46 - gorgeous scene called fantasy Kingdom
02:49 - this one is using the fantasy Kingdom
02:50 - cinti asset which by the way if you're
02:52 - interested you can go pick it up in the
02:54 - Black Friday sale on the cyy store right
02:56 - now they used that asset they polished
02:58 - up everything and made a truly gorgeous
03:00 - looking scene honestly this is going to
03:02 - be the thing that I point people to
03:03 - whenever they say that low poly doesn't
03:05 - look good I think this looks absolutely
03:07 - gorgeous it goes to show the actual
03:09 - power of great lighting and great
03:11 - postprocessing this scene is using AGP
03:14 - although all the features they showcase
03:15 - they are both for urp and agrp the first
03:19 - one is the GPU resident drawer now I'm
03:22 - not a graphics programmer so I'm not
03:23 - entirely sure what exactly it's doing
03:25 - but apparently it's using the GPU
03:27 - instead of the CPU to calulate batches
03:29 - which makes it a lot more performant
03:30 - with literally just one button click
03:32 - another addition is GPU occlusion
03:34 - calling like name implies this use the
03:36 - GPU so again super performant calling if
03:39 - you don't know basically means that you
03:41 - don't render things that are not visible
03:43 - meaning things that are behind other
03:44 - objects should not be rendered and this
03:47 - system is also Dynamic so as the rock
03:49 - moves in front of the camera the number
03:50 - of vertices drawn goes down
03:52 - substantially and best of all is it
03:54 - requires no preparation Unity actually
03:56 - already has a coing system I have a
03:59 - lecture on it in my ultimate unity
04:00 - overview course if you want to learn
04:01 - about it but first of all that one is
04:03 - based on the CPU instead of the GPU and
04:06 - secondly it requires you to bake an
04:07 - occlusion map so it has some setup
04:09 - required whereas this one requires
04:12 - absolutely no setup you just enable it
04:14 - and anything that is in front of the
04:15 - camera automatically calls anything
04:17 - behind it the other big Graphics feature
04:20 - is what they are calling spatial
04:21 - temporal post procing or STP this is an
04:25 - upscaler so kind of like amd's Fidelity
04:27 - super resolution or nvidia's DLS
04:30 - so you can render your game at a smaller
04:32 - resolution like for example 1080P and
04:34 - then upscale it to something like 4K
04:36 - this obviously makes it run much faster
04:38 - and apparently this algorithm is good
04:40 - enough that it comes with no perceptible
04:42 - visual cost remember all of this all of
04:44 - these features they are all working both
04:46 - hrp and urp so these awesome features
04:49 - will benefit literally every game even
04:51 - games on mobile as long as they are in a
04:53 - computer enabled device which nowadays I
04:55 - believe is pretty much all of them
04:57 - honestly this part really impressed me
04:59 - I'm always a a huge fan of oneclick
05:00 - buttons to make everything faster so
05:02 - here are three buttons that
05:04 - automatically make your game Run much
05:06 - better I am not a graphics programmer so
05:08 - hearing that my games won render that
05:10 - much faster just by default that is an
05:11 - awesome thing again remember none of
05:13 - this requires you to prepare or change
05:15 - your existing Assets in any way just
05:18 - press one button and like magic
05:20 - everything runs faster really impressive
05:21 - and next comes another extremely
05:23 - impressive two showcase this is one that
05:25 - I've had my own for quite some time and
05:27 - something that a lot of people have been
05:29 - asking for
05:30 - it's called adaptive probe volumes
05:32 - basically it automates the placement of
05:34 - light probes in your scene so you no
05:35 - longer have to do it Hand by hand one by
05:37 - one so that's a huge timesaver and then
05:40 - along with that comes some really high
05:42 - quality lighting including some bounce
05:44 - lighting so you can have some really
05:46 - high quality Global illumination this is
05:48 - something that people have wanted for a
05:49 - long time basically an equivalent to un
05:51 - real Lumin and Yep this is it I've been
05:54 - really impressed with this tool since I
05:55 - saw it announced I believe a year ago
05:57 - but back then it was hrp only whereas
06:00 - now in un6 it will be out for both hrp
06:03 - and urp lighting is extremely important
06:05 - for making a game look good and with
06:07 - global illumination it really makes it
06:09 - look excellent now from what I
06:11 - understand technically this isn't real
06:12 - time from what I understand the probes
06:14 - are placed automatically and then they
06:16 - have to be baked and then you can
06:17 - interpolate between various bakes to
06:19 - make the final gorgeous day night cycle
06:21 - so technically requires a little bit of
06:23 - setup but the results definitely look
06:25 - excellent I am indeed looking forward to
06:27 - trying out this Tel as Unity 6 comes
06:28 - closer all in all these four Graphics
06:30 - improvements making games instantly
06:32 - perform better and look excellent with
06:34 - global illumination put all of these
06:36 - together and it will make every single
06:37 - unity game look absolutely excellent I'm
06:39 - not usually someone who cares too much
06:41 - about graphics for me I definitely
06:43 - prefer a gameplay over Graphics any day
06:45 - but still this part of the keynote
06:47 - really impressed me now related to urp
06:49 - there's also a nice new sample this is
06:51 - the one that they've shown quite a while
06:52 - ago and now you can go ahead and
06:54 - download it it's one sample but it's
06:56 - really 4 in one you've got multiple
06:58 - scenes showcasing various use cases for
07:00 - urp it starts off with a scene with
07:02 - neutral lighting then the garden shows
07:05 - off a scene with tons of Lights the
07:08 - desert scene this one showcased lots of
07:10 - high quality lighting and some really
07:11 - interesting shaders with subsurface
07:13 - scattering and then the cockpit this one
07:15 - showcases a stylized VR view again all
07:18 - of these are in urp personally I think
07:20 - they all look excellent you should
07:22 - definitely spend some time in speec in
07:23 - this sample if you want to see all the
07:25 - new urp features yet another great new
07:27 - sample that is coming soon is Mega City
07:29 - metro this is a competitive crossplay
07:32 - multiplayer sample previously Mega city
07:34 - was hdrp only and it was a bit janky but
07:37 - now this has been ported to urp so it
07:39 - runs on everything it used dos net code
07:42 - alongside lots of unity multiplayer
07:43 - gaming services like game server hosting
07:45 - matchmaking and vvox I can confirm that
07:48 - I was at the show floor and I tried out
07:50 - the demo on a mobile phone and yep
07:52 - everything worked great people are
07:53 - always talking about how they want more
07:55 - sample so this one should be another
07:56 - great one it's coming out next year then
07:58 - possibly the big news is their AI tools
08:01 - are now available AI is obviously the
08:03 - big hype right now it has tremendous
08:05 - potential but the tools are still
08:07 - actively being developed I've been part
08:09 - of the closed beta for a while now but
08:11 - since it was heavily under NDA that
08:13 - meant I really couldn't do a video on it
08:14 - so I haven't looked into them too much
08:17 - there are essentially four tools you've
08:19 - got Muse chat this is a chat bot kind of
08:21 - like chat GPT the main benefit is how
08:24 - this one is trained on unity's own
08:26 - documentation so technically that means
08:28 - that it should be better than some like
08:30 - chpt for Unity specific questions then
08:33 - you've got Muse texture this one lets
08:34 - you use AI to build textures using
08:36 - natural language again this is trained
08:39 - specifically for making game textures so
08:41 - they are all table and can easily have
08:44 - all kinds of repeating patterns
08:45 - alongside normal Maps the results do
08:47 - seem pretty good for a final game you
08:49 - might still want handdrawn textures made
08:51 - by a professional artist but in terms of
08:53 - speeding up the prot time stage I think
08:55 - this tool can be quite useful instead of
08:57 - just a boring gray box for protype you
08:59 - can quickly get some textures so in that
09:01 - scenario I think this tool can be
09:02 - extremely helpful and another super
09:04 - helpful one is the third tool which is M
09:06 - Sprite similar to the previous one this
09:08 - lets you generate AI Sprites these can
09:11 - be anything that you describe like the
09:12 - many generative AI image tools that
09:14 - already exist although again since this
09:16 - one was trained specifically on Unity
09:18 - data and game data it should hopefully
09:21 - be better at generating game rate
09:22 - Sprites as opposed to something like
09:23 - stable diffusion like the main thing is
09:26 - how it actually outputs transparent
09:27 - Sprites so no need for you to deal
09:29 - around in Photoshop erasing the
09:31 - background or anything the Sprites are
09:33 - easy and ready to use this one seems
09:35 - capable of drawing pretty much anything
09:37 - you just say what you want and it gets
09:39 - run and it also has a feature where you
09:41 - draw a sketch of what you want which
09:42 - helps guide the a generation honestly I
09:45 - think this one this tool this would have
09:47 - been a game changer for me when I was
09:49 - just getting started in Game Dev 10
09:50 - years ago I used to only do 2D games
09:53 - because I could not model anything at
09:55 - all whereas nowadays I'm mostly focusing
09:57 - on making 3D games since now I do know
09:59 - know how to use the accur to get any
10:00 - visuals that I need but if you do make
10:03 - 2D games or really even in 3D games
10:05 - since you always need some Sprites then
10:07 - this tool looks potentially quite useful
10:09 - these two AI tools also work directly
10:11 - inside the editor meaning it is much
10:13 - faster to use these as opposed to going
10:15 - to something external so again I think
10:17 - for prototyping where you really want
10:19 - maximum speed as much as possible for
10:20 - that these tools do seem excellent they
10:23 - should really help speed up all your
10:24 - iteration during the pro timing stage
10:27 - for these AI tools I highlighted how is
10:29 - is trained on data that they own so this
10:31 - helps avoid one of the main issues with
10:33 - AI generation right now which is if you
10:35 - don't own the inputs then you can't own
10:37 - the outputs so in this case they made
10:40 - sure to own all the inputs so you can't
10:41 - generate anything without copyright
10:43 - issues but again that is still illegal
10:45 - gray area so Unity is doing what several
10:48 - other companies like Adobe are also
10:49 - doing they are committing to defend you
10:52 - in court in the unlikely event that
10:54 - there is a copyright Challenge on any of
10:55 - the generated outputs there is a
10:57 - detailed blog post and an FAQ where they
10:59 - talk about where they got all the input
11:01 - data sets and how they license them the
11:03 - fourth tool is Unity synus this is their
11:06 - real time inference engine meaning it's
11:09 - how you can run a model in the unity
11:10 - runtime without needing any external
11:12 - connection to anything this is related
11:14 - to something that un has had for quite a
11:16 - while which was called Barracuda if
11:18 - you've used the ml agents package then
11:20 - you already know what it is basically
11:22 - you train a model and then you can
11:24 - easily run that model using Unity sentes
11:26 - locally on any device and importantly is
11:29 - it supports all of the platforms the
11:30 - unity supports meaning that you can
11:32 - actually run some complex machine
11:34 - learning models directly on your phone
11:36 - this is something that seems quite
11:37 - interesting seems like a very
11:39 - interesting piece of tech but honestly
11:41 - I'm still looking for a practical use
11:43 - case for it one really impressive
11:45 - example is something that they showed on
11:46 - the keynote although they didn't
11:47 - actually talk about what was impressive
11:49 - about it it's a demo of a pong game with
11:52 - some super high quality rate race
11:54 - lighting it looks gorgeous and it's
11:56 - running on a phone even though phones do
11:57 - not support R race lighting I spoke with
12:00 - Mark Whitten who is the president of
12:02 - unity create on the welcome party the
12:04 - day before and he told me how this demo
12:06 - actually worked basically the developer
12:08 - trained the model on millions and
12:09 - millions of high quality images rendered
12:11 - in blender and once the model was
12:13 - trained all it needed was really just an
12:15 - input for the position of the paddles
12:17 - and the ball and that's it all the
12:19 - images that you see these are all
12:20 - generated just based on those inputs
12:23 - that's how it can look insanely
12:24 - realistic on a tiny mobile phone I don't
12:26 - know just how practical this use case is
12:28 - but it is definitely very ingenious so
12:30 - those are the four noun seols but they
12:32 - also showcase some more coming in the
12:33 - future there's animate this one looks
12:36 - super useful it's an AI tool for helping
12:38 - you build animations basically you tell
12:40 - it in natural language do some like a
12:42 - backflip and it automatically generates
12:44 - a backflip animation like I said
12:46 - nowadays I'm mostly working in 3D so
12:48 - this one seems potentially quite useful
12:50 - to my particular use case then there's
12:52 - Behavior this ai2 lets you describe a
12:54 - state machine using natural language and
12:56 - then it generates that actual State
12:58 - machine with all the various States so
13:00 - definitely another interesting use case
13:02 - and then there's sketch this one
13:04 - apparently lets you very quickly sketch
13:05 - out a level you can say get me a
13:07 - warehouse and somehow it grabs one and
13:09 - place it in the world right away
13:11 - obviously this makes me wonder where
13:12 - exactly are these models coming from and
13:15 - this is also a collaborative tool so you
13:17 - can use it alongside other people these
13:19 - tools are going to be released at some
13:20 - point in the future not sure when and
13:22 - again all these tools do seem to be
13:24 - quite useful in the Pro timing stage for
13:26 - getting your ideas up and running
13:27 - extremely fast for that use case these
13:29 - tools all seem very useful then for the
13:32 - not so good news pricing these tools
13:35 - come as a subscription at $30 per month
13:38 - by itself that's not really bad news all
13:39 - of the AI tools they are all
13:41 - subscription based so personally I don't
13:43 - think this part is specifically an issue
13:45 - what is an issue is a simple fact that
13:47 - there is no free tier at all not only
13:49 - that but this is a separate subscription
13:51 - and there is nothing included if you
13:52 - already have a Unity Pro subscription
13:54 - this is something that I've spoken very
13:56 - strongly in my feedback to Unity I think
13:58 - it really absolutely needs some sort of
14:00 - free tier and some credits included for
14:02 - pro users I know that AI is really
14:04 - expensive to train and to run it
14:06 - requires tons of GPU power so I really
14:09 - would not expect a compl free tool but
14:11 - at the same time these AI tools they are
14:13 - also quite fiddly so they really need
14:15 - some way to try before you buy they do
14:17 - have a free trial but it's once and it's
14:19 - done I guess it's better than nothing if
14:22 - you want to try it out right now you can
14:23 - go ahead and use that free trial like I
14:25 - said I think these tools can be
14:27 - massively useful especially for for
14:28 - beginners and students who might really
14:30 - have no money pretty much like myself 10
14:32 - years ago but with this pay wall I don't
14:35 - think it won't be accessible to those
14:36 - people I truly think that this needs
14:38 - some sort of free tier just a handful of
14:40 - credits per month to try it out for free
14:42 - so just enough to generate some like 10
14:44 - Sprites and 10 textures per month like I
14:46 - said I understand AI is really expensive
14:48 - so I would not expect a massive amount
14:50 - but definitely would expect some tiny
14:52 - amount pretty much like many other AI
14:54 - tools there's a lot of them that of
14:56 - course they've got paid pricing but they
14:57 - also include some fre credits every
14:59 - month and I really think that it's
15:01 - pretty insane how Pro users who are
15:02 - already paying a decent amount of unity
15:04 - don't get anything at all that Unity
15:06 - subscription should really include at
15:08 - least some credits now the good news is
15:10 - that this is only the Beta release
15:12 - meaning that things will definitely
15:13 - change in the future so I'm really truly
15:15 - hoping that it's this way because they
15:17 - intentionally want to limit how many
15:18 - people use this tool at this stage
15:20 - basically so they have more time to
15:22 - improve things and handle the scaling on
15:24 - their back end and then when these tools
15:25 - are production ready I hoping they will
15:27 - announce a new free here alongside it
15:29 - like I said I see a lot of potential for
15:31 - these tools especially for protyping and
15:33 - for beginners so I really hope they
15:35 - eventually add a free tier so that
15:37 - anyone can benefit web browsers also got
15:39 - a bunch of improvements specifically on
15:41 - mobile it seems they're really betting
15:43 - on web mobile being a big thing
15:45 - something they announce is web GPU this
15:47 - is a new standard that the various
15:49 - browser makers are trying to make happen
15:51 - basically to allow the browser to have
15:52 - direct access to GPU this would
15:54 - obviously massively increase the
15:56 - performance of any web games so this
15:58 - makes makes me wonder if there won't be
15:59 - a future kind of like back in the days
16:01 - of flash where web games were awesome
16:03 - and all over the place then another big
16:05 - thing is Vision West /po spatial this is
16:08 - the unity for working with the Apple
16:10 - Vision Pro that is coming out next year
16:12 - previously it was invite only but now
16:14 - it's available for everyone AR in mixed
16:16 - reality is definitely an area that I've
16:18 - been wanting to cover for a long time so
16:20 - hopefully I can find the time to at
16:21 - least do a quick introduction tutorial
16:23 - on it the Apple Vision Pro looks like a
16:25 - potentially interesting machine I mean
16:27 - it's definitely not going to be Mass
16:28 - Market due to how high the cost is but
16:31 - in terms of tech it doesn't look quite
16:32 - interesting so if that also interests
16:34 - you now you can go ahead and try out the
16:36 - SDK to prepare for it Unity dots is
16:38 - already production ready and they still
16:40 - keep working on it again focusing on
16:42 - making it more stable and polishing
16:44 - everything this time they are now
16:46 - improving everything based on actual
16:47 - user feedback a bunch of people have
16:49 - been using it since it's been production
16:51 - ready for quite a while now and based on
16:53 - that they are making the next versions
16:54 - as best as they can be personally I've
16:57 - been re- researching dots these past few
16:59 - weeks I really would like to put out an
17:01 - updated getting started video hopefully
17:02 - still by before the end this month then
17:05 - they announce Unity Cloud this is a
17:07 - bunch of tools to make working as a team
17:09 - much more streamlined you can easily
17:11 - sync Assets in the asset manager it
17:13 - works well with unity Version Control
17:15 - there's improvements to cicd the
17:17 - dashboard is more streamlined and so on
17:20 - personally I only work alone so I don't
17:21 - really have much use for this myself but
17:24 - if you do work in a team or if you do
17:26 - game jams with other people then perhaps
17:27 - this might help Streamlight that process
17:29 - okay so that's my overview of the
17:31 - keynote all in all it really seems like
17:33 - a nice focus on stability and
17:35 - incremental improvements which is
17:36 - exactly what people have been asking
17:38 - about the new CEO with his vision for a
17:40 - community focused Unity I really like
17:42 - that vision and I really hope it becomes
17:44 - reality but like he himself said talk is
17:47 - cheap and really what counts our actions
17:49 - so I'm really looking forward to seeing
17:50 - how he guides the company over the next
17:52 - few months but based on this keynote as
17:54 - it is I would say the future doesn't
17:56 - look very bright especially the graphics
17:58 - improvements those look absolutely
17:59 - massive oh and one final quick mention
18:02 - the unity Black Friday sale is live
18:04 - right now I covered a bunch of my
18:05 - highlights in the last video their
18:07 - Splash deals up to 70% off so keep
18:09 - refreshing the page to see what's on
18:11 - sale the cyti store is also having a
18:13 - Black Friday sale so if you'll need
18:15 - anything from City specifically check
18:17 - out their store and I also made a Black
18:19 - Friday deal on discount on my courses so
18:21 - if you need anything check out the links
18:22 - in the description all right so thanks
18:24 - for watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod Maki unity's annual unite conference has just happened in Amsterdam lots of news and announcements about the future Unity sponsored this video and they invited me over to check out the conference this was actually the first conference since I started using a camera in my videos so a bunch of people recognize me thank you all for being so nice it's always great to meet people in real life who enjoy watching and learning from my videos so really thank you my voice is still quite a bit messed up from talking to so many people these events are definitely extremely intense although always a lot of fun now the main thing is the keynote so here's an overview I originally wanted to do a super short summary but there's actually quite a lot to talk about first important thing is honestly just the general sentiment given everything that's happened in the past two months so they spoke a lot about a focus on stability performance visuals and really just tightening everything there are some interesting new announcements but also a lot of just improving upon everything that already exists which is what most people have been calling for so I think that's a good thing the message coming from new CEO was indeed one of refocusing Unity on its core focusing on games and making the the engine the best it can be with a great focus on community I think that's a great sentiment and I truly hope that he can bring his Community Focus vision for Unity to life honestly for me personally right now the main thing I want from imunity is really just stability meaning stability in the company itself I'm just hoping for some calm and no new scandals in the next few months thankfully despite the fact that he only got the job two months ago I would say the keynote already reflected part of that Community Focus Vision there's lots of improvements tons of downloadable samples and a handful of tools so pretty much everything that everyone wants one of the main things is how they announce a new naming scheme the next major version of unity instead of being called the 23 LTS will simply be called Unity 6 I remember when they changed from Unity 5 to Unity 2017 and now apparently they're going back to normal nonyear numbers now the version name is actually something that I've given my feedback on several times the year version is usually one year behind meaning right now in the year 23 the version you should be using is the 22 LTS but for some people especially beginners just starting to learn they feel that the 22 version is outdated since we're already in 23 so they end up using a tech version which is not necessarily the most stable and end up with a frustrating experience my feedback that I've said to un many times was simply increase the version number by one but maybe this change just using a number that has nothing to do with the year maybe this will also help that problem along with the new naming scheme they're also apparently pushing back on the release by a little bit usually the LTS version comes around in March and for next year Unity will have a beta out in March so I'm guessing that the full release will be out in something like September again for this I'm hoping that it means they are really focusing on stability so hopefully this new release Cadence should be a good thing oh and also the 23.2 version is out right now then the most impactful part of the keynote for me was how they showcase some great graphics improvements for both urp and agrp they showcased a truly gorgeous scene called fantasy Kingdom this one is using the fantasy Kingdom cinti asset which by the way if you're interested you can go pick it up in the Black Friday sale on the cyy store right now they used that asset they polished up everything and made a truly gorgeous looking scene honestly this is going to be the thing that I point people to whenever they say that low poly doesn't look good I think this looks absolutely gorgeous it goes to show the actual power of great lighting and great postprocessing this scene is using AGP although all the features they showcase they are both for urp and agrp the first one is the GPU resident drawer now I'm not a graphics programmer so I'm not entirely sure what exactly it's doing but apparently it's using the GPU instead of the CPU to calulate batches which makes it a lot more performant with literally just one button click another addition is GPU occlusion calling like name implies this use the GPU so again super performant calling if you don't know basically means that you don't render things that are not visible meaning things that are behind other objects should not be rendered and this system is also Dynamic so as the rock moves in front of the camera the number of vertices drawn goes down substantially and best of all is it requires no preparation Unity actually already has a coing system I have a lecture on it in my ultimate unity overview course if you want to learn about it but first of all that one is based on the CPU instead of the GPU and secondly it requires you to bake an occlusion map so it has some setup required whereas this one requires absolutely no setup you just enable it and anything that is in front of the camera automatically calls anything behind it the other big Graphics feature is what they are calling spatial temporal post procing or STP this is an upscaler so kind of like amd's Fidelity super resolution or nvidia's DLS so you can render your game at a smaller resolution like for example 1080P and then upscale it to something like 4K this obviously makes it run much faster and apparently this algorithm is good enough that it comes with no perceptible visual cost remember all of this all of these features they are all working both hrp and urp so these awesome features will benefit literally every game even games on mobile as long as they are in a computer enabled device which nowadays I believe is pretty much all of them honestly this part really impressed me I'm always a a huge fan of oneclick buttons to make everything faster so here are three buttons that automatically make your game Run much better I am not a graphics programmer so hearing that my games won render that much faster just by default that is an awesome thing again remember none of this requires you to prepare or change your existing Assets in any way just press one button and like magic everything runs faster really impressive and next comes another extremely impressive two showcase this is one that I've had my own for quite some time and something that a lot of people have been asking for it's called adaptive probe volumes basically it automates the placement of light probes in your scene so you no longer have to do it Hand by hand one by one so that's a huge timesaver and then along with that comes some really high quality lighting including some bounce lighting so you can have some really high quality Global illumination this is something that people have wanted for a long time basically an equivalent to un real Lumin and Yep this is it I've been really impressed with this tool since I saw it announced I believe a year ago but back then it was hrp only whereas now in un6 it will be out for both hrp and urp lighting is extremely important for making a game look good and with global illumination it really makes it look excellent now from what I understand technically this isn't real time from what I understand the probes are placed automatically and then they have to be baked and then you can interpolate between various bakes to make the final gorgeous day night cycle so technically requires a little bit of setup but the results definitely look excellent I am indeed looking forward to trying out this Tel as Unity 6 comes closer all in all these four Graphics improvements making games instantly perform better and look excellent with global illumination put all of these together and it will make every single unity game look absolutely excellent I'm not usually someone who cares too much about graphics for me I definitely prefer a gameplay over Graphics any day but still this part of the keynote really impressed me now related to urp there's also a nice new sample this is the one that they've shown quite a while ago and now you can go ahead and download it it's one sample but it's really 4 in one you've got multiple scenes showcasing various use cases for urp it starts off with a scene with neutral lighting then the garden shows off a scene with tons of Lights the desert scene this one showcased lots of high quality lighting and some really interesting shaders with subsurface scattering and then the cockpit this one showcases a stylized VR view again all of these are in urp personally I think they all look excellent you should definitely spend some time in speec in this sample if you want to see all the new urp features yet another great new sample that is coming soon is Mega City metro this is a competitive crossplay multiplayer sample previously Mega city was hdrp only and it was a bit janky but now this has been ported to urp so it runs on everything it used dos net code alongside lots of unity multiplayer gaming services like game server hosting matchmaking and vvox I can confirm that I was at the show floor and I tried out the demo on a mobile phone and yep everything worked great people are always talking about how they want more sample so this one should be another great one it's coming out next year then possibly the big news is their AI tools are now available AI is obviously the big hype right now it has tremendous potential but the tools are still actively being developed I've been part of the closed beta for a while now but since it was heavily under NDA that meant I really couldn't do a video on it so I haven't looked into them too much there are essentially four tools you've got Muse chat this is a chat bot kind of like chat GPT the main benefit is how this one is trained on unity's own documentation so technically that means that it should be better than some like chpt for Unity specific questions then you've got Muse texture this one lets you use AI to build textures using natural language again this is trained specifically for making game textures so they are all table and can easily have all kinds of repeating patterns alongside normal Maps the results do seem pretty good for a final game you might still want handdrawn textures made by a professional artist but in terms of speeding up the prot time stage I think this tool can be quite useful instead of just a boring gray box for protype you can quickly get some textures so in that scenario I think this tool can be extremely helpful and another super helpful one is the third tool which is M Sprite similar to the previous one this lets you generate AI Sprites these can be anything that you describe like the many generative AI image tools that already exist although again since this one was trained specifically on Unity data and game data it should hopefully be better at generating game rate Sprites as opposed to something like stable diffusion like the main thing is how it actually outputs transparent Sprites so no need for you to deal around in Photoshop erasing the background or anything the Sprites are easy and ready to use this one seems capable of drawing pretty much anything you just say what you want and it gets run and it also has a feature where you draw a sketch of what you want which helps guide the a generation honestly I think this one this tool this would have been a game changer for me when I was just getting started in Game Dev 10 years ago I used to only do 2D games because I could not model anything at all whereas nowadays I'm mostly focusing on making 3D games since now I do know know how to use the accur to get any visuals that I need but if you do make 2D games or really even in 3D games since you always need some Sprites then this tool looks potentially quite useful these two AI tools also work directly inside the editor meaning it is much faster to use these as opposed to going to something external so again I think for prototyping where you really want maximum speed as much as possible for that these tools do seem excellent they should really help speed up all your iteration during the pro timing stage for these AI tools I highlighted how is is trained on data that they own so this helps avoid one of the main issues with AI generation right now which is if you don't own the inputs then you can't own the outputs so in this case they made sure to own all the inputs so you can't generate anything without copyright issues but again that is still illegal gray area so Unity is doing what several other companies like Adobe are also doing they are committing to defend you in court in the unlikely event that there is a copyright Challenge on any of the generated outputs there is a detailed blog post and an FAQ where they talk about where they got all the input data sets and how they license them the fourth tool is Unity synus this is their real time inference engine meaning it's how you can run a model in the unity runtime without needing any external connection to anything this is related to something that un has had for quite a while which was called Barracuda if you've used the ml agents package then you already know what it is basically you train a model and then you can easily run that model using Unity sentes locally on any device and importantly is it supports all of the platforms the unity supports meaning that you can actually run some complex machine learning models directly on your phone this is something that seems quite interesting seems like a very interesting piece of tech but honestly I'm still looking for a practical use case for it one really impressive example is something that they showed on the keynote although they didn't actually talk about what was impressive about it it's a demo of a pong game with some super high quality rate race lighting it looks gorgeous and it's running on a phone even though phones do not support R race lighting I spoke with Mark Whitten who is the president of unity create on the welcome party the day before and he told me how this demo actually worked basically the developer trained the model on millions and millions of high quality images rendered in blender and once the model was trained all it needed was really just an input for the position of the paddles and the ball and that's it all the images that you see these are all generated just based on those inputs that's how it can look insanely realistic on a tiny mobile phone I don't know just how practical this use case is but it is definitely very ingenious so those are the four noun seols but they also showcase some more coming in the future there's animate this one looks super useful it's an AI tool for helping you build animations basically you tell it in natural language do some like a backflip and it automatically generates a backflip animation like I said nowadays I'm mostly working in 3D so this one seems potentially quite useful to my particular use case then there's Behavior this ai2 lets you describe a state machine using natural language and then it generates that actual State machine with all the various States so definitely another interesting use case and then there's sketch this one apparently lets you very quickly sketch out a level you can say get me a warehouse and somehow it grabs one and place it in the world right away obviously this makes me wonder where exactly are these models coming from and this is also a collaborative tool so you can use it alongside other people these tools are going to be released at some point in the future not sure when and again all these tools do seem to be quite useful in the Pro timing stage for getting your ideas up and running extremely fast for that use case these tools all seem very useful then for the not so good news pricing these tools come as a subscription at $30 per month by itself that's not really bad news all of the AI tools they are all subscription based so personally I don't think this part is specifically an issue what is an issue is a simple fact that there is no free tier at all not only that but this is a separate subscription and there is nothing included if you already have a Unity Pro subscription this is something that I've spoken very strongly in my feedback to Unity I think it really absolutely needs some sort of free tier and some credits included for pro users I know that AI is really expensive to train and to run it requires tons of GPU power so I really would not expect a compl free tool but at the same time these AI tools they are also quite fiddly so they really need some way to try before you buy they do have a free trial but it's once and it's done I guess it's better than nothing if you want to try it out right now you can go ahead and use that free trial like I said I think these tools can be massively useful especially for for beginners and students who might really have no money pretty much like myself 10 years ago but with this pay wall I don't think it won't be accessible to those people I truly think that this needs some sort of free tier just a handful of credits per month to try it out for free so just enough to generate some like 10 Sprites and 10 textures per month like I said I understand AI is really expensive so I would not expect a massive amount but definitely would expect some tiny amount pretty much like many other AI tools there's a lot of them that of course they've got paid pricing but they also include some fre credits every month and I really think that it's pretty insane how Pro users who are already paying a decent amount of unity don't get anything at all that Unity subscription should really include at least some credits now the good news is that this is only the Beta release meaning that things will definitely change in the future so I'm really truly hoping that it's this way because they intentionally want to limit how many people use this tool at this stage basically so they have more time to improve things and handle the scaling on their back end and then when these tools are production ready I hoping they will announce a new free here alongside it like I said I see a lot of potential for these tools especially for protyping and for beginners so I really hope they eventually add a free tier so that anyone can benefit web browsers also got a bunch of improvements specifically on mobile it seems they're really betting on web mobile being a big thing something they announce is web GPU this is a new standard that the various browser makers are trying to make happen basically to allow the browser to have direct access to GPU this would obviously massively increase the performance of any web games so this makes makes me wonder if there won't be a future kind of like back in the days of flash where web games were awesome and all over the place then another big thing is Vision West /po spatial this is the unity for working with the Apple Vision Pro that is coming out next year previously it was invite only but now it's available for everyone AR in mixed reality is definitely an area that I've been wanting to cover for a long time so hopefully I can find the time to at least do a quick introduction tutorial on it the Apple Vision Pro looks like a potentially interesting machine I mean it's definitely not going to be Mass Market due to how high the cost is but in terms of tech it doesn't look quite interesting so if that also interests you now you can go ahead and try out the SDK to prepare for it Unity dots is already production ready and they still keep working on it again focusing on making it more stable and polishing everything this time they are now improving everything based on actual user feedback a bunch of people have been using it since it's been production ready for quite a while now and based on that they are making the next versions as best as they can be personally I've been re researching dots these past few weeks I really would like to put out an updated getting started video hopefully still by before the end this month then they announce Unity Cloud this is a bunch of tools to make working as a team much more streamlined you can easily sync Assets in the asset manager it works well with unity Version Control there's improvements to cicd the dashboard is more streamlined and so on personally I only work alone so I don't really have much use for this myself but if you do work in a team or if you do game jams with other people then perhaps this might help Streamlight that process okay so that's my overview of the keynote all in all it really seems like a nice focus on stability and incremental improvements which is exactly what people have been asking about the new CEO with his vision for a community focused Unity I really like that vision and I really hope it becomes reality but like he himself said talk is cheap and really what counts our actions so I'm really looking forward to seeing how he guides the company over the next few months but based on this keynote as it is I would say the future doesn't look very bright especially the graphics improvements those look absolutely massive oh and one final quick mention the unity Black Friday sale is live right now I covered a bunch of my highlights in the last video their Splash deals up to 70% off so keep refreshing the page to see what's on sale the cyti store is also having a Black Friday sale so if you'll need anything from City specifically check out their store and I also made a Black Friday deal on discount on my courses so if you need anything check out the links in the description all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
