00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - here's a quick question could you build
00:04 - Zelda tears of the Kingdom in unity the
00:06 - answer is yes yes you can alright so
00:08 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
00:10 - next time okay okay so here's a bit more
00:12 - detail on that answer now while I am
00:14 - saying you could definitely build a game
00:15 - like this in unity I am absolutely not
00:17 - dismissing the work the devs put into it
00:19 - the game is excellent and it truly is a
00:21 - Marvel of both design and Engineering
00:23 - the fact that this game with this huge
00:25 - scale and so many interconnected systems
00:27 - manages to run on what is essentially by
00:28 - now ancient Hardware that is truly
00:30 - amazing now my first reason for saying
00:33 - you could definitely build a game like
00:34 - this in unity is simply to look at other
00:36 - games on a similar scale that already
00:37 - exist this example is perhaps a game
00:39 - that was actually called a breath of the
00:41 - wild clone when it first came out I'm
00:43 - talking about the engine impact which a
00:45 - lot of people don't know is indeed made
00:46 - with unity when that game came out
00:48 - people encounter clone mostly because
00:50 - visually it doesn't look indeed quite
00:52 - similar even though they are very
00:53 - different games but that game does also
00:55 - have a huge open world it also has tons
00:58 - of characters and systems and it works
00:59 - on PC consoles and even mobile valheim
01:02 - is another example of a massive game
01:04 - made with yinty it features a huge world
01:06 - with tons of biomes also has some pretty
01:09 - complex building mechanics and all of it
01:10 - even while working in multiplayer and
01:12 - perhaps the biggest one that I'm aware
01:14 - of is license year program really
01:16 - excellent Factory building game with an
01:18 - insane amount of moving objects and
01:19 - machines you can build massive factories
01:22 - and you don't just build on a single
01:23 - planet but rather in the entire galaxy
01:25 - so you really can't get a bigger scale
01:27 - than that looking at these clearly as
01:29 - long as you and your team have the
01:30 - skills necessary the engine is
01:32 - definitely capable of producing
01:33 - something on this scale although like I
01:35 - said while it is possible it is not a
01:36 - trivial task making it work does require
01:38 - lots of smoke and mirrors lots of
01:40 - trickery in the background the most
01:42 - obvious one is simply LDS which Unity
01:44 - supports by default if you're moving in
01:46 - tears of the kingdom and you unlock in
01:47 - the background you will see the end of
01:48 - these change quite a lot the highest mod
01:50 - is unloaded when pre-closed that helps
01:53 - lower the number of polygons on screen
01:54 - despite having such a huge view distance
01:56 - same thing for the grass on terrain that
01:59 - one is also very limited in terms of
02:00 - distance if you are actively trying to
02:02 - look for it you will notice these things
02:04 - but when playing the game normally
02:05 - everything looks and plays great you can
02:07 - Implement these features in unity
02:09 - another thing that I immediately noticed
02:11 - was right in the beginning link chips
02:12 - off a sky island and Float sound for me
02:15 - I'm playing on a projector with a fairly
02:16 - large image and as he was falling I
02:18 - could very clearly see some huge
02:20 - pixelation so another very important
02:22 - trick they're using is simply reducing
02:23 - the render scale if there's a huge
02:25 - distance visible on screen this is also
02:27 - something you can do in unity in various
02:29 - ways the render pipeline asset has a
02:31 - render scale that you can play with and
02:33 - there's also a feature called Dynamic
02:35 - resolution where you have very fine
02:36 - grain control over how exactly your game
02:38 - renders I have a lecture on this very
02:40 - obscure feature in my ultimate TNT ovary
02:42 - course by the way the game that I'm
02:44 - using here to demonstrate these tricks
02:45 - is my upcoming Steam games Inky
02:47 - Guardians it's a fun Co-op action
02:49 - automation building game check it out
02:51 - the link in the description and add it
02:52 - to your wishlist and one thing they have
02:54 - to do that Unity suddenly doesn't have a
02:56 - built-in tool is World streaming on a
02:59 - huge world you can't really the entire
03:00 - thing at once especially on a memory
03:02 - limited device like the switch to build
03:04 - that in unity you would probably need to
03:05 - combine some super low rest rains for
03:07 - the far away parts and possibly work
03:09 - with some additive scene loading
03:11 - definitely take some work but it can be
03:13 - done then for the enemies I would assume
03:15 - they also have some kind of AI LOD
03:17 - system meaning that while the player is
03:19 - very far away they probably only run
03:20 - some simple walking or patrolling AI
03:22 - only when you get close to they start to
03:24 - enable some more complex behaviors note
03:26 - that while the game world is indeed huge
03:28 - you don't really have any scenarios
03:30 - where you encounter tons and tons of
03:31 - enemies or moving objects at once most
03:33 - of it is really just rain which nowadays
03:35 - game engines are pretty good at handling
03:36 - so if you use all these techniques then
03:38 - you too can build the game on this
03:40 - massive scale so again asking the
03:41 - question can you build a game like tears
03:43 - of the Kingdom in unity yes yes you can
03:45 - nowadays pretty much every engine is
03:47 - excellent and can build pretty much any
03:49 - game you can imagine you can make a
03:51 - giant open world game like engine impact
03:53 - with unity you can make a sort of 2D 3D
03:55 - game like Dragon Ball Fighters within
03:57 - real you can make a very unique game
03:59 - like Squad with Godot especially
04:02 - nowadays whatever game ID you have and
04:03 - whatever game engine you have as long as
04:05 - you have the skills yes you can build it
04:07 - oh and if you need assets to make your
04:09 - huge open World Games a reality there's
04:11 - a huge humble moment right now with over
04:12 - 5000 assets for just 25 bucks alright
04:15 - hope that's useful check out these
04:17 - videos to learn some more thanks to
04:19 - these awesome patreon supporters for
04:20 - making these videos possible thank you
04:22 - for watching and I'll see you next time
