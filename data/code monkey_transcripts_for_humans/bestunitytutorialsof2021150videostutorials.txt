00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and another year has just passed so in
00:04 - this video let's check out a quick
00:05 - summary of the best videos from 2021
00:08 - tons of interesting unique videos this
00:09 - year in total 152 videos that's quite a
00:12 - lot i try to cover tons of topics so
00:15 - there's lots of variety tons of
00:16 - tutorials lots of showcase videos
00:18 - complete games top new games and assets
00:20 - asset reviews and how it's made videos
00:22 - most of these are my own videos since
00:24 - that's what i'm most familiar with but
00:25 - stick around to the end where i will
00:27 - also highlight some other great
00:28 - tutorials and great channels from other
00:30 - creators that you should follow i made a
00:32 - page on the website where you can find
00:33 - the links to all of these videos all of
00:35 - them nicely grouped into categories so
00:37 - you can watch them later and last year i
00:39 - also made a page and a video just like
00:41 - this one so if you want to get a quick
00:42 - overview of what i made in 2020 then
00:44 - check that out alright so let's look at
00:47 - some of these highlights going back
00:48 - through all these to make this video was
00:50 - quite a journey sometimes it feels like
00:52 - one year is such a short amount of time
00:54 - but looking at this list i can't believe
00:56 - how so many of these were done this year
00:58 - it really feels like a lifetime ago so
01:01 - the first tutorial of the year was a
01:03 - tutorial on machine learning vision
01:04 - using ml agents machine learning is a
01:07 - fascinating topic and something that
01:09 - will probably get more and more use
01:10 - cases in the future vision is a really
01:12 - cool use case the machine literally
01:14 - learns to see and take action based on
01:16 - what it sees i also use machine learning
01:18 - to solve a match 3 game so that one is
01:21 - an example of how you can teach an ai to
01:23 - play your game and then you can use it
01:24 - to become much more efficient during
01:26 - testing so it's been one year since i
01:28 - last touched machine learning but i
01:29 - definitely want to do some more this
01:30 - year then in february i had my very
01:33 - first truly viral video it was the
01:35 - misleading ads game chances are lots of
01:37 - you found the channel because of that
01:39 - video it's got almost 700 000 views
01:42 - whereas my regular videos at the time
01:43 - got just around 5 000 the concept is
01:46 - that there's tons of ads that show a
01:48 - really interesting puzzle fluid game but
01:50 - when you click on it the final game is
01:52 - really just a boring match 3. so i
01:54 - decided to simply turn that concept into
01:56 - a real game this was a really fun video
01:58 - and fun game to make it involved
02:00 - learning how to make fluids in unity
02:02 - which i also made a dedicated tutorial
02:04 - on the final game came out pretty nice
02:06 - it does play exactly like the game in
02:08 - those misleading ads
02:10 - another really cool video and game this
02:12 - year was more recently the squid game i
02:15 - was watching the show just like everyone
02:17 - else and decided to make a game about it
02:19 - but there were already many people that
02:21 - recreated it exactly so i thought why
02:23 - not to add a nice twist where instead of
02:25 - playing as the player you play as the
02:27 - guard i think that's a nice idea and the
02:29 - final game came out pretty fun it's got
02:32 - lots of effects and some very satisfying
02:34 - ragdolls so it looks and plays great
02:36 - the video is a devlog of how i made it
02:38 - which actually was pretty fast this year
02:40 - i also made tons more things based on my
02:42 - super useful grid system
02:44 - this series of videos continues to be an
02:46 - excellent example on why you should
02:48 - write good clean code
02:50 - first one was on making a grid building
02:52 - system perfect for any kind of city
02:54 - builder game
02:55 - very easy to add some more building
02:57 - types rotate them and place them
02:58 - anywhere in the world this one was
03:00 - pretty easy to make thanks to the very
03:02 - well built grid class that was first
03:03 - made all the way back in 2019 then i
03:06 - also took that to the next level and
03:08 - made a house building system it involves
03:10 - placing the ground pieces just like the
03:12 - grid building system and then just
03:14 - attaching some walls and multiple levels
03:16 - it's a real nice system and a really
03:18 - nice demo then around that time i was
03:20 - also playing valheim so i took that
03:22 - house building system and made it work
03:23 - in third person it's really great to
03:25 - walk around the world with a character
03:27 - just look around and build a really nice
03:29 - house another really awesome use case
03:31 - for the grid system was making the
03:33 - tetris inventory system i really like
03:35 - making this one it was based on my
03:37 - memories of playing commandos as a kid
03:39 - you have items and each item has a
03:41 - specific shape you can rotate and place
03:44 - that shape that item in your inventory
03:46 - anywhere you want it's a nice system
03:48 - that adds an extra layer of interesting
03:50 - decisions when interacting with an
03:52 - inventory
03:53 - and i also finally decided to take my
03:55 - grid system and make a mini game in one
03:56 - of my favorite genres making a factory
03:59 - automation game it came out really well
04:01 - you have various buildings various items
04:03 - and recipes use grabbers to grab some
04:05 - items conveyor belts to move them around
04:07 - and craft more and more complex items
04:10 - it's a pretty nice mini game and i think
04:12 - it also looks really nice what inspired
04:14 - me to make that minigame was at the time
04:16 - i was playing dyson sphere program it's
04:18 - a really awesome factory automation game
04:20 - with a huge scale and since i was
04:22 - playing it i also made a video on my
04:24 - gamedev review series going through the
04:26 - game and analyzing why it was so good in
04:28 - that series i also covered valheim it's
04:31 - an awesome game that was massively
04:33 - successful and you can definitely learn
04:34 - a lot from it i covered a bunch of game
04:36 - design lessons that you can learn from
04:38 - the game and the first game dev review
04:40 - video i did was on falconer it's a
04:42 - pretty fun indie game with some pretty
04:43 - interesting mechanics another video
04:45 - series that i also started this year was
04:47 - the how it's made videos this is where i
04:49 - play some game find an interesting
04:51 - mechanic and then recreate that mechanic
04:53 - in unity start off with remaking the
04:56 - soil moisture system from the game end
04:58 - zone aurora part
04:59 - basically a bunch of clouds are spawned
05:01 - then they rain and the rain wets the
05:03 - soil beneath them which could then be
05:04 - connected to some sort of farming system
05:07 - then i played rover mechanic simulator
05:09 - and recreated the cleaning minigame this
05:11 - one was very useful for me personally i
05:13 - learned how you can actually paint a 3d
05:15 - model on a very specific place in this
05:18 - case just use it with the mouse position
05:19 - in order to clean a dirt texture then i
05:22 - picked up otherwise on game pass and
05:23 - found the scope probe to be an
05:25 - interesting mechanic that is actually
05:26 - pretty easy to recreate it's mostly just
05:29 - a projectile with a camera attached to
05:30 - it it's simple and works great and
05:33 - finally i've played some verdun and this
05:35 - time we created three mechanics from it
05:37 - first the artillery how you can look at
05:39 - a point in the world and spawn some
05:41 - explosions on that exact point
05:43 - then the gas system which involves
05:44 - learning about local post-processing
05:46 - volumes and some basic logic and finally
05:49 - the arrow system where you can click and
05:50 - draw on the minimap which could then be
05:52 - used for giving orders to your teammates
05:55 - speaking of that let's go through some
05:56 - of the tutorials one of them being a
05:58 - dedicated tutorial on that drawing
06:00 - system it's how you can draw anything
06:02 - directly inside of unity
06:04 - it's pretty simple it really just
06:05 - involves learning how to dynamically
06:07 - create meshes
06:08 - so as usual this year i made tons of
06:10 - tutorials on various levels of
06:12 - complexity
06:13 - some really basic ones like how to get
06:15 - the mouse warm position covering how to
06:17 - get it both in 2d and 3d also how to add
06:20 - glow in unity this one is pretty basic
06:23 - but i see quite a lot of comments asking
06:24 - about it so i made a dedicated video
06:26 - that i can now send to people then i
06:28 - made a video on how to get free
06:30 - characters and free animations it's all
06:32 - about mixamo most of you probably
06:34 - already know about it but some people
06:35 - don't and it's in a super useful website
06:38 - i made a question dialogue it's pretty
06:40 - essential to any game i think i did use
06:42 - this one in literally every single one
06:44 - of my steam games then i cover the
06:46 - destruction in unity how to use pro
06:48 - builder to slice objects and trigger an
06:50 - explosion with physics also apply that
06:52 - same logic to a render texture making a
06:54 - really nice screen exploded effect
06:56 - speaking of render textures i made a
06:58 - dedicated video about them they are
07:00 - super useful if you don't know about
07:02 - them definitely go watch that video
07:03 - right now i've used them in making so
07:05 - many effects
07:07 - one of the more useful tutorials was the
07:09 - third person shooter tutorial
07:11 - it's actually quite simple just involves
07:13 - a basic character controller identifying
07:15 - the mouse position and handling some
07:17 - basic logic
07:18 - you can use this as a starting point for
07:20 - so many game ideas to make the character
07:22 - aim perfectly it involves using the
07:24 - animation rating package this one is a
07:26 - super useful package it really helps you
07:28 - make your animations much more dynamic
07:30 - super useful another ent tool i covered
07:33 - was navmesh this is unity's built-in
07:35 - pathfinding system works quite well in
07:37 - many scenarios
07:38 - and i also cover the new input system
07:41 - it's a pretty long video but it will
07:43 - teach you absolutely everything you need
07:44 - to know about this new system and then
07:46 - two more general but extremely important
07:49 - tutorials
07:50 - first on why you should not make
07:52 - everything public if you want to write
07:54 - good clean code then this one is a must
07:56 - watch another one very useful for
07:58 - beginners on the unity versions and how
08:00 - they are categorized then i also did
08:02 - some fun tutorials one on multiple ways
08:04 - of making a rifle scope zoom one on
08:07 - saving a screenshot along with a save
08:09 - file and at the time i was playing some
08:11 - battlefield and decided to make a quick
08:13 - tutorial on some simple capture areas
08:15 - logic and speaking of that another genre
08:17 - of videos i experimented with was making
08:19 - some shorts specifically making quick
08:21 - how it's made videos
08:23 - these are under 60 seconds and they are
08:24 - pretty nice made one on the hook shot in
08:27 - battlefield how you could recreate it
08:30 - then as i was playing hades i also made
08:32 - a quick how it's made on the path climb
08:34 - effect essentially making a sprite for a
08:36 - preset path
08:37 - and another one on the transition effect
08:39 - pretty simple and looks great
08:41 - another short format i experimented with
08:44 - was making some quick tips
08:46 - made some on magic numbers unity logs
08:48 - how to keep your project clean debug
08:50 - lines frame rate testing and many more
08:52 - if you haven't seen any of these short
08:54 - videos i would suggest you go watch them
08:56 - right now you can really watch the home
08:57 - playlist and go through all the videos
08:59 - in under 10 minutes you might learn
09:01 - something very useful in a very short
09:02 - amount of time
09:04 - there were also some really interesting
09:05 - miscellaneous videos this year unreal 5
09:08 - was unveiled which looks great so i made
09:10 - a video with my thoughts as a unity
09:12 - developer earlier in the year i made a
09:14 - video on 5 devlogs to watch during this
09:16 - year one of those is now released and
09:18 - the others are still in development it's
09:20 - pretty fun to see how far they've come
09:22 - another interesting one was on why i
09:24 - don't do game jams
09:26 - you might have noticed that i rarely
09:27 - participate in game jams and in that
09:29 - video i cover my reasons and some pros
09:31 - and cons of game jams and one that took
09:33 - me ages to make and quite different from
09:35 - the usual was my blockchain explained
09:37 - video i was researching blockchain
09:39 - technology for many months learning how
09:41 - it works and in the end i made a nice
09:43 - demo going through it step by step on
09:45 - exactly how technology works starting
09:47 - off with a simple block then adding some
09:49 - data to that block hashing the block for
09:52 - security adding a connection to the
09:54 - previous walk and so on it was great to
09:56 - research this topic if you have any
09:58 - interest in the technology give it a
10:00 - watch so you are more familiar with how
10:02 - it actually works which then helps you
10:04 - separate all of the hype you hear from
10:05 - the reality this year i also started my
10:08 - series covering the top new games made
10:10 - with unity every month
10:12 - this one is a great series for me to
10:13 - keep up to date with what's coming out
10:15 - and see what is finding success
10:17 - learning about new releases and what is
10:19 - popular is definitely a must if you want
10:21 - to be a successful indie game developer
10:23 - so i will definitely continue doing this
10:24 - series once a month in 22. another top
10:27 - 10 series was my new asset series i go
10:30 - through the entire store every month
10:32 - then i pick 10 free assets 10 systems
10:34 - and tools and 20 visual assets once
10:37 - again i do these videos so i myself keep
10:39 - up to date with what's coming out
10:41 - there's constantly lots of awesome stuff
10:42 - coming out on the store and some of
10:44 - these assets can really help you on your
10:46 - game dev journey this year i also
10:48 - launched my very first assets first a
10:50 - free asset the key door system it's very
10:53 - simple does exactly what it's meant to
10:54 - do you create some keys pick them up and
10:56 - use them to open doors and i also made
10:58 - the mouse cursor system pro this one is
11:01 - all about letting you easily create
11:02 - custom cursors
11:04 - if you want your games to send out and
11:05 - adding a custom animated cursor is a
11:07 - great way to do it and including the
11:09 - asset is also a really in-depth
11:11 - walkthrough tutorial on how exactly this
11:13 - system works i only managed to create
11:15 - these two but this year i definitely
11:17 - want to do some more both free and paid
11:20 - speaking of assets another series that i
11:22 - started was my asset review series
11:24 - there's tons of awesome stuff on the
11:25 - store but not much info on which ones
11:28 - are worth it and how exactly they work
11:30 - so in those videos i go through some
11:32 - assets check out how they work what the
11:34 - documentation and demos look like and
11:36 - then include a quick getting started
11:37 - tutorial i've made a bunch of them on
11:39 - some very interesting assets
11:41 - first one on the a-star pathfinding
11:43 - project i've been using this asset since
11:45 - my very first steam game so i picked
11:47 - this asset all the way back in 2013.
11:49 - it's been really useful then the odin
11:51 - inspector this one is an excellent tool
11:53 - for making tools if you use it correctly
11:56 - it has the power to greatly increase
11:57 - your productivity after that was curved
12:00 - whirls this one is a fun effect that
12:02 - will instantly make your game stand out
12:04 - then the all-in-one sprite shader this
12:06 - one is awesome for anything in 2d makes
12:09 - it super easy to add tons of effects and
12:11 - really take your game's polish to the
12:12 - next level
12:14 - then i explored rayfire one of the most
12:16 - impressive assets that i've seen it's
12:18 - all about destruction you can break your
12:19 - objects into millions of pieces looks
12:21 - awesome and is really performant after
12:24 - that with the quantum console extremely
12:26 - useful in so many scenarios you can
12:28 - easily create a console and set up
12:30 - commands to trigger any functions in
12:31 - your code i'm definitely going to be
12:33 - using this one in any future games i
12:35 - make
12:36 - and then i covered feel this one is an
12:38 - asset all about making your game feel
12:40 - awesome
12:41 - you can easily add polish with tons and
12:43 - tons of effects so all of those are
12:45 - great to explore and by watching the
12:46 - reviews you can see how they work and if
12:48 - they are worth the asking price i will
12:50 - definitely continue making more of these
12:52 - in the future there's tons of really
12:54 - awesome assets that can really help you
12:55 - out
12:56 - and of course this year i also worked on
12:58 - my courses right in the beginning of the
13:00 - year was my update to my visual
13:02 - scripting course i add the third game to
13:04 - it a 3d first person shooter so with
13:07 - that the visual scripting course is
13:09 - really complete it starts off with a
13:11 - basic 2d platformer to learn the basics
13:13 - then a 2d rpg with tons of features and
13:16 - finally a 3d first person shooter every
13:19 - single one of those games is made
13:20 - internally with visual scripting there's
13:22 - no code anywhere in those games then in
13:24 - the middle of the year i'll launch my
13:26 - ultimate unity overview course
13:28 - this one is all about covering all the
13:30 - tools and features of the engine there's
13:32 - tons of them each lecture covers a
13:34 - different one so there's one lecture on
13:36 - nav mesh one on pro builder another one
13:38 - on animation rigging one on ragdolls and
13:40 - so on there's tons and tons of tones and
13:42 - features so the goal with this one right
13:44 - from the beginning was to make something
13:46 - that i could then expand and update over
13:48 - time
13:49 - at launch it had 13 lectures and since
13:51 - then there's been two free updates
13:53 - adding 20 more lectures explaining more
13:55 - and more tools and features there's
13:57 - still tons more so if you already have
13:59 - the course definitely look forward to
14:01 - several more free updates coming this
14:02 - year okay so those were my highlights
14:05 - from 2021 but there's tons of awesome
14:07 - creators making lots of awesome unity
14:09 - content on youtube this year mark brown
14:12 - from game makers toolkit started working
14:14 - on his game chances are most of you are
14:16 - familiar with the channel but if not
14:18 - definitely go watch it it's an awesome
14:20 - channel with excellently produced videos
14:22 - where you can learn a ton about game
14:24 - design
14:25 - then flow studio which is the channel
14:27 - for the game lens allen that i also
14:28 - covered in the devlogs video that came
14:30 - out this year
14:31 - their devlogs are great and they also
14:33 - made a mini documentary on the process
14:35 - of building lens island over several
14:37 - years very interesting one channel that
14:39 - has been doing excellent in-depth
14:41 - tutorials is high heart game dev the
14:43 - videos are extremely well produced and
14:45 - really diving deep into each topic
14:47 - and there is tons more like json weiman
14:49 - python prod and fontbone code tarot dev
14:52 - and many more
14:53 - if you are looking for more game dev
14:55 - content and tutorials definitely check
14:56 - them out alright so that was 2021
14:59 - looking back it's really quite insane
15:01 - how many topics i managed to cover and
15:03 - how many things i don't some of these
15:05 - feel like they were made a lifetime ago
15:07 - but it was really just one year it
15:09 - really goes to show how if you do
15:11 - something every single day even if it
15:13 - doesn't seem like much it definitely
15:14 - adds up over the course of a year
15:16 - so take that advice and apply to your
15:18 - own games do something no matter how
15:20 - tiny every single day and in one year
15:22 - you'll have made a ton of progress
15:25 - and i genuinely hope you found the
15:26 - videos useful and that they helped you
15:28 - learn on your game development journey
15:30 - this channel really only exists because
15:32 - you watch a video so sincerely thank you
15:34 - for watching them i hope to keep making
15:36 - many many more interesting videos to
15:38 - inspire and teach you for many years to
15:40 - come and speaking of this community i
15:42 - asked you which thumbnail was best for
15:44 - this video and got tons of responses
15:46 - that was awesome and especially thank
15:48 - you to shreyas who had the excellent
15:49 - idea of combining the simplicity of the
15:51 - first one with the extra detail of the
15:53 - second one on the corner of the
15:54 - thumbnail so thanks again for watching
15:56 - and stay tuned for an awesome 2022.
16:05 - [Music]
16:08 - you

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and another year has just passed so in this video let's check out a quick summary of the best videos from 2021 tons of interesting unique videos this year in total 152 videos that's quite a lot i try to cover tons of topics so there's lots of variety tons of tutorials lots of showcase videos complete games top new games and assets asset reviews and how it's made videos most of these are my own videos since that's what i'm most familiar with but stick around to the end where i will also highlight some other great tutorials and great channels from other creators that you should follow i made a page on the website where you can find the links to all of these videos all of them nicely grouped into categories so you can watch them later and last year i also made a page and a video just like this one so if you want to get a quick overview of what i made in 2020 then check that out alright so let's look at some of these highlights going back through all these to make this video was quite a journey sometimes it feels like one year is such a short amount of time but looking at this list i can't believe how so many of these were done this year it really feels like a lifetime ago so the first tutorial of the year was a tutorial on machine learning vision using ml agents machine learning is a fascinating topic and something that will probably get more and more use cases in the future vision is a really cool use case the machine literally learns to see and take action based on what it sees i also use machine learning to solve a match 3 game so that one is an example of how you can teach an ai to play your game and then you can use it to become much more efficient during testing so it's been one year since i last touched machine learning but i definitely want to do some more this year then in february i had my very first truly viral video it was the misleading ads game chances are lots of you found the channel because of that video it's got almost 700 000 views whereas my regular videos at the time got just around 5 000 the concept is that there's tons of ads that show a really interesting puzzle fluid game but when you click on it the final game is really just a boring match 3. so i decided to simply turn that concept into a real game this was a really fun video and fun game to make it involved learning how to make fluids in unity which i also made a dedicated tutorial on the final game came out pretty nice it does play exactly like the game in those misleading ads another really cool video and game this year was more recently the squid game i was watching the show just like everyone else and decided to make a game about it but there were already many people that recreated it exactly so i thought why not to add a nice twist where instead of playing as the player you play as the guard i think that's a nice idea and the final game came out pretty fun it's got lots of effects and some very satisfying ragdolls so it looks and plays great the video is a devlog of how i made it which actually was pretty fast this year i also made tons more things based on my super useful grid system this series of videos continues to be an excellent example on why you should write good clean code first one was on making a grid building system perfect for any kind of city builder game very easy to add some more building types rotate them and place them anywhere in the world this one was pretty easy to make thanks to the very well built grid class that was first made all the way back in 2019 then i also took that to the next level and made a house building system it involves placing the ground pieces just like the grid building system and then just attaching some walls and multiple levels it's a real nice system and a really nice demo then around that time i was also playing valheim so i took that house building system and made it work in third person it's really great to walk around the world with a character just look around and build a really nice house another really awesome use case for the grid system was making the tetris inventory system i really like making this one it was based on my memories of playing commandos as a kid you have items and each item has a specific shape you can rotate and place that shape that item in your inventory anywhere you want it's a nice system that adds an extra layer of interesting decisions when interacting with an inventory and i also finally decided to take my grid system and make a mini game in one of my favorite genres making a factory automation game it came out really well you have various buildings various items and recipes use grabbers to grab some items conveyor belts to move them around and craft more and more complex items it's a pretty nice mini game and i think it also looks really nice what inspired me to make that minigame was at the time i was playing dyson sphere program it's a really awesome factory automation game with a huge scale and since i was playing it i also made a video on my gamedev review series going through the game and analyzing why it was so good in that series i also covered valheim it's an awesome game that was massively successful and you can definitely learn a lot from it i covered a bunch of game design lessons that you can learn from the game and the first game dev review video i did was on falconer it's a pretty fun indie game with some pretty interesting mechanics another video series that i also started this year was the how it's made videos this is where i play some game find an interesting mechanic and then recreate that mechanic in unity start off with remaking the soil moisture system from the game end zone aurora part basically a bunch of clouds are spawned then they rain and the rain wets the soil beneath them which could then be connected to some sort of farming system then i played rover mechanic simulator and recreated the cleaning minigame this one was very useful for me personally i learned how you can actually paint a 3d model on a very specific place in this case just use it with the mouse position in order to clean a dirt texture then i picked up otherwise on game pass and found the scope probe to be an interesting mechanic that is actually pretty easy to recreate it's mostly just a projectile with a camera attached to it it's simple and works great and finally i've played some verdun and this time we created three mechanics from it first the artillery how you can look at a point in the world and spawn some explosions on that exact point then the gas system which involves learning about local postprocessing volumes and some basic logic and finally the arrow system where you can click and draw on the minimap which could then be used for giving orders to your teammates speaking of that let's go through some of the tutorials one of them being a dedicated tutorial on that drawing system it's how you can draw anything directly inside of unity it's pretty simple it really just involves learning how to dynamically create meshes so as usual this year i made tons of tutorials on various levels of complexity some really basic ones like how to get the mouse warm position covering how to get it both in 2d and 3d also how to add glow in unity this one is pretty basic but i see quite a lot of comments asking about it so i made a dedicated video that i can now send to people then i made a video on how to get free characters and free animations it's all about mixamo most of you probably already know about it but some people don't and it's in a super useful website i made a question dialogue it's pretty essential to any game i think i did use this one in literally every single one of my steam games then i cover the destruction in unity how to use pro builder to slice objects and trigger an explosion with physics also apply that same logic to a render texture making a really nice screen exploded effect speaking of render textures i made a dedicated video about them they are super useful if you don't know about them definitely go watch that video right now i've used them in making so many effects one of the more useful tutorials was the third person shooter tutorial it's actually quite simple just involves a basic character controller identifying the mouse position and handling some basic logic you can use this as a starting point for so many game ideas to make the character aim perfectly it involves using the animation rating package this one is a super useful package it really helps you make your animations much more dynamic super useful another ent tool i covered was navmesh this is unity's builtin pathfinding system works quite well in many scenarios and i also cover the new input system it's a pretty long video but it will teach you absolutely everything you need to know about this new system and then two more general but extremely important tutorials first on why you should not make everything public if you want to write good clean code then this one is a must watch another one very useful for beginners on the unity versions and how they are categorized then i also did some fun tutorials one on multiple ways of making a rifle scope zoom one on saving a screenshot along with a save file and at the time i was playing some battlefield and decided to make a quick tutorial on some simple capture areas logic and speaking of that another genre of videos i experimented with was making some shorts specifically making quick how it's made videos these are under 60 seconds and they are pretty nice made one on the hook shot in battlefield how you could recreate it then as i was playing hades i also made a quick how it's made on the path climb effect essentially making a sprite for a preset path and another one on the transition effect pretty simple and looks great another short format i experimented with was making some quick tips made some on magic numbers unity logs how to keep your project clean debug lines frame rate testing and many more if you haven't seen any of these short videos i would suggest you go watch them right now you can really watch the home playlist and go through all the videos in under 10 minutes you might learn something very useful in a very short amount of time there were also some really interesting miscellaneous videos this year unreal 5 was unveiled which looks great so i made a video with my thoughts as a unity developer earlier in the year i made a video on 5 devlogs to watch during this year one of those is now released and the others are still in development it's pretty fun to see how far they've come another interesting one was on why i don't do game jams you might have noticed that i rarely participate in game jams and in that video i cover my reasons and some pros and cons of game jams and one that took me ages to make and quite different from the usual was my blockchain explained video i was researching blockchain technology for many months learning how it works and in the end i made a nice demo going through it step by step on exactly how technology works starting off with a simple block then adding some data to that block hashing the block for security adding a connection to the previous walk and so on it was great to research this topic if you have any interest in the technology give it a watch so you are more familiar with how it actually works which then helps you separate all of the hype you hear from the reality this year i also started my series covering the top new games made with unity every month this one is a great series for me to keep up to date with what's coming out and see what is finding success learning about new releases and what is popular is definitely a must if you want to be a successful indie game developer so i will definitely continue doing this series once a month in 22. another top 10 series was my new asset series i go through the entire store every month then i pick 10 free assets 10 systems and tools and 20 visual assets once again i do these videos so i myself keep up to date with what's coming out there's constantly lots of awesome stuff coming out on the store and some of these assets can really help you on your game dev journey this year i also launched my very first assets first a free asset the key door system it's very simple does exactly what it's meant to do you create some keys pick them up and use them to open doors and i also made the mouse cursor system pro this one is all about letting you easily create custom cursors if you want your games to send out and adding a custom animated cursor is a great way to do it and including the asset is also a really indepth walkthrough tutorial on how exactly this system works i only managed to create these two but this year i definitely want to do some more both free and paid speaking of assets another series that i started was my asset review series there's tons of awesome stuff on the store but not much info on which ones are worth it and how exactly they work so in those videos i go through some assets check out how they work what the documentation and demos look like and then include a quick getting started tutorial i've made a bunch of them on some very interesting assets first one on the astar pathfinding project i've been using this asset since my very first steam game so i picked this asset all the way back in 2013. it's been really useful then the odin inspector this one is an excellent tool for making tools if you use it correctly it has the power to greatly increase your productivity after that was curved whirls this one is a fun effect that will instantly make your game stand out then the allinone sprite shader this one is awesome for anything in 2d makes it super easy to add tons of effects and really take your game's polish to the next level then i explored rayfire one of the most impressive assets that i've seen it's all about destruction you can break your objects into millions of pieces looks awesome and is really performant after that with the quantum console extremely useful in so many scenarios you can easily create a console and set up commands to trigger any functions in your code i'm definitely going to be using this one in any future games i make and then i covered feel this one is an asset all about making your game feel awesome you can easily add polish with tons and tons of effects so all of those are great to explore and by watching the reviews you can see how they work and if they are worth the asking price i will definitely continue making more of these in the future there's tons of really awesome assets that can really help you out and of course this year i also worked on my courses right in the beginning of the year was my update to my visual scripting course i add the third game to it a 3d first person shooter so with that the visual scripting course is really complete it starts off with a basic 2d platformer to learn the basics then a 2d rpg with tons of features and finally a 3d first person shooter every single one of those games is made internally with visual scripting there's no code anywhere in those games then in the middle of the year i'll launch my ultimate unity overview course this one is all about covering all the tools and features of the engine there's tons of them each lecture covers a different one so there's one lecture on nav mesh one on pro builder another one on animation rigging one on ragdolls and so on there's tons and tons of tones and features so the goal with this one right from the beginning was to make something that i could then expand and update over time at launch it had 13 lectures and since then there's been two free updates adding 20 more lectures explaining more and more tools and features there's still tons more so if you already have the course definitely look forward to several more free updates coming this year okay so those were my highlights from 2021 but there's tons of awesome creators making lots of awesome unity content on youtube this year mark brown from game makers toolkit started working on his game chances are most of you are familiar with the channel but if not definitely go watch it it's an awesome channel with excellently produced videos where you can learn a ton about game design then flow studio which is the channel for the game lens allen that i also covered in the devlogs video that came out this year their devlogs are great and they also made a mini documentary on the process of building lens island over several years very interesting one channel that has been doing excellent indepth tutorials is high heart game dev the videos are extremely well produced and really diving deep into each topic and there is tons more like json weiman python prod and fontbone code tarot dev and many more if you are looking for more game dev content and tutorials definitely check them out alright so that was 2021 looking back it's really quite insane how many topics i managed to cover and how many things i don't some of these feel like they were made a lifetime ago but it was really just one year it really goes to show how if you do something every single day even if it doesn't seem like much it definitely adds up over the course of a year so take that advice and apply to your own games do something no matter how tiny every single day and in one year you'll have made a ton of progress and i genuinely hope you found the videos useful and that they helped you learn on your game development journey this channel really only exists because you watch a video so sincerely thank you for watching them i hope to keep making many many more interesting videos to inspire and teach you for many years to come and speaking of this community i asked you which thumbnail was best for this video and got tons of responses that was awesome and especially thank you to shreyas who had the excellent idea of combining the simplicity of the first one with the extra detail of the second one on the corner of the thumbnail so thanks again for watching and stay tuned for an awesome 2022. you
