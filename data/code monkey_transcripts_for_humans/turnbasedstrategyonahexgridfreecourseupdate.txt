00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and I've just added a free expansion to
00:04 - my turn-based strategy course this one
00:06 - is all about taking the game built in
00:07 - the course and converting it from a
00:09 - square grid onto a hex grid this was the
00:11 - most request topic by students thanks to
00:13 - how all of the code in the course is
00:15 - written in a really nice clean way this
00:17 - actually super easy addition it just
00:19 - requires modifying a handful of scripts
00:21 - and everything else already works
00:23 - perfectly so there's no need to touch
00:25 - the AI the actions the visuals are
00:27 - really anything because all of the code
00:29 - is really clean with as few dependencies
00:31 - as possible this change only requires
00:33 - changing pretty much just two classes
00:34 - the grid system and the pathfinding so
00:37 - this expansion is also yet another
00:39 - excellent example of the power of
00:40 - writing good clean code and how it makes
00:42 - expanding upon your code adding more
00:44 - features and changing things and how
00:45 - that becomes so much easier if you
00:47 - already own the course then this is a
00:49 - free expansion so you already have
00:50 - access to it it's at the end of London
00:52 - lectures
00:53 - and if you don't yet own the course you
00:55 - can get it to the link description it's
00:56 - a really awesome course that will help
00:58 - you take your skills from beginner to
00:59 - Advanced
01:00 - their views have been extremely positive
01:02 - so I'm really happy with how it came out
01:04 - throughout the course I'm constantly
01:05 - talking about writing good clean code
01:07 - and focus on keeping a good code
01:08 - architecture so because of that the
01:11 - final state of the course is very
01:12 - adaptable and easily Expendable this is
01:14 - the first expansion so do let me know
01:16 - what other mechanics and systems you'd
01:17 - like to see in future expansions alright
01:19 - I hope you enjoyed this free update
01:21 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
01:23 - next time
