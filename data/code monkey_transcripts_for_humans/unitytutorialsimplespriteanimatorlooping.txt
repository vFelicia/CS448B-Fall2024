00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to add
00:03 - more functionality to our sprite
00:05 - animator to make it handle looping and
00:07 - fire events
00:08 - let's get sir
00:12 - so in here I have the scene from the
00:15 - previous video with my character playing
00:17 - a wonk animation let's start off by
00:20 - adding a tag on for looping or not so
00:23 - going to our code here and in here we're
00:25 - going to add a private ball and just
00:28 - called and by default for now let's set
00:32 - it to false to test if our code works
00:35 - when hope is false so down here on our
00:38 - current frame we want to stop the
00:41 - animation if our current frame reset
00:44 - back to zero so let's go here and make
00:46 - if current frame equal zero so if we
00:50 - have reset back to the first frame we
00:52 - want to stop playing so let's make a new
00:55 - function and we're gonna call it stop
00:57 - play go down here and make a private boy
01:01 - stop playing and in order to stop
01:04 - playing we're going to make a new
01:06 - private ball and call it is playing by
01:11 - the phone set it to true and in here
01:14 - when we stop playing
01:15 - we just set it to phones and on our
01:18 - update if we are not supposed to be
01:22 - playing then we're simply gonna return
01:24 - and here we actually only want to stop
01:26 - playing if we are not supposed to loop
01:29 - and the current frame is zero if not
01:32 - then update the current frame as usual
01:34 - in here and let's set our frame right to
01:37 - one per second just so we can easily
01:39 - test and let's see it should play on
01:44 - frames and then stop there you go the
01:46 - second the third the fourth and stop
01:48 - okay great it's not changing anymore
01:51 - okay now let's reset our variable to
01:54 - true and make sure our previous behavior
01:56 - is still working just as it should there
01:59 - you go it is changing second third
02:01 - fourth and yep exactly it's not changing
02:04 - okay great so we can now control our
02:07 - animation and make it either loop or
02:09 - don't loop and we're going to add some
02:12 - events to fire every time the animation
02:14 - loops so going up here and make a public
02:18 - event it won't be of type event handler
02:22 - which
02:22 - is in the system namespace and we're
02:26 - going to call it on animation so this
02:32 - won't be fired every time the animation
02:34 - loops so in here we're going to fire it
02:38 - if we're back to frame 0 we want to fire
02:41 - it on both scenarios so let's set
02:43 - another hip down here if current frame
02:46 - equals 0 then we want to find so if on
02:50 - animation loop if it is different from
02:52 - no then we're going to trigger on
02:54 - animation with this and even our stock
02:57 - empty so in order to test our event
03:00 - let's just go into our script and make a
03:03 - game handler script we're going to
03:06 - attach it to our game handler object and
03:11 - on my game hand well let's make a
03:12 - private sprite animator called sprite
03:15 - animator and it's going to be a serious
03:18 - film so we can add it in the inspector
03:22 - I'm going to have a private void start
03:24 - and inside it I'm going to subscribe to
03:27 - the sprite animator dot on animation
03:30 - loop up here I'm going to be using the
03:36 - code monkey utilities which is always
03:38 - you can grab for free from int code
03:40 - monkey comm I'm going to go into the
03:43 - class CMD bug to spawn a text pop up on
03:46 - the mouse position and just say and on
03:49 - animation glue just an easy way to test
03:52 - to see if our events are being fired
03:54 - let's see and yep you can see it's
03:58 - firing the event every time the
04:00 - animation loops great now let's set up
04:03 - another event for when it loops but only
04:06 - trigger the first time which is
04:07 - sometimes very useful so let's make
04:11 - another public event on animation looped
04:14 - first time and now on this event won't
04:17 - be when the current frame is 0 and then
04:20 - we have to make sure we're on the first
04:21 - loop so we're going to need up here a
04:24 - private int will counter and let's start
04:29 - at 0 so every time we go back to current
04:33 - frame 0 we're going to increase our own
04:35 - and if we counter if it is one so the
04:41 - person loop has just finished then we're
04:43 - going to fire our event the event is on
04:46 - animation loop for the first time and
04:50 - into our game and learn let's add
04:53 - another subscriber to our event on
04:56 - animation loop for the first time let's
04:58 - download and make another pop-up on the
05:03 - mouse and we'll say that alright so now
05:06 - we should be saying the first pop-up
05:08 - won't pop up with both messages and
05:10 - subsequently only the second message yep
05:15 - everything is working right as you can
05:16 - see the first time it popped up both
05:18 - messages and now it's only firing the
05:20 - second event so there you have it we
05:23 - took our initial basic sprite animator
05:26 - and we added some loop functionality and
05:28 - firing events as always you can download
05:32 - the project files and utilities for free
05:34 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
05:37 - any questions post them in the comments
05:38 - and I'll do my best answer them see you
05:40 - next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to add more functionality to our sprite animator to make it handle looping and fire events let's get sir so in here I have the scene from the previous video with my character playing a wonk animation let's start off by adding a tag on for looping or not so going to our code here and in here we're going to add a private ball and just called and by default for now let's set it to false to test if our code works when hope is false so down here on our current frame we want to stop the animation if our current frame reset back to zero so let's go here and make if current frame equal zero so if we have reset back to the first frame we want to stop playing so let's make a new function and we're gonna call it stop play go down here and make a private boy stop playing and in order to stop playing we're going to make a new private ball and call it is playing by the phone set it to true and in here when we stop playing we just set it to phones and on our update if we are not supposed to be playing then we're simply gonna return and here we actually only want to stop playing if we are not supposed to loop and the current frame is zero if not then update the current frame as usual in here and let's set our frame right to one per second just so we can easily test and let's see it should play on frames and then stop there you go the second the third the fourth and stop okay great it's not changing anymore okay now let's reset our variable to true and make sure our previous behavior is still working just as it should there you go it is changing second third fourth and yep exactly it's not changing okay great so we can now control our animation and make it either loop or don't loop and we're going to add some events to fire every time the animation loops so going up here and make a public event it won't be of type event handler which is in the system namespace and we're going to call it on animation so this won't be fired every time the animation loops so in here we're going to fire it if we're back to frame 0 we want to fire it on both scenarios so let's set another hip down here if current frame equals 0 then we want to find so if on animation loop if it is different from no then we're going to trigger on animation with this and even our stock empty so in order to test our event let's just go into our script and make a game handler script we're going to attach it to our game handler object and on my game hand well let's make a private sprite animator called sprite animator and it's going to be a serious film so we can add it in the inspector I'm going to have a private void start and inside it I'm going to subscribe to the sprite animator dot on animation loop up here I'm going to be using the code monkey utilities which is always you can grab for free from int code monkey comm I'm going to go into the class CMD bug to spawn a text pop up on the mouse position and just say and on animation glue just an easy way to test to see if our events are being fired let's see and yep you can see it's firing the event every time the animation loops great now let's set up another event for when it loops but only trigger the first time which is sometimes very useful so let's make another public event on animation looped first time and now on this event won't be when the current frame is 0 and then we have to make sure we're on the first loop so we're going to need up here a private int will counter and let's start at 0 so every time we go back to current frame 0 we're going to increase our own and if we counter if it is one so the person loop has just finished then we're going to fire our event the event is on animation loop for the first time and into our game and learn let's add another subscriber to our event on animation loop for the first time let's download and make another popup on the mouse and we'll say that alright so now we should be saying the first popup won't pop up with both messages and subsequently only the second message yep everything is working right as you can see the first time it popped up both messages and now it's only firing the second event so there you have it we took our initial basic sprite animator and we added some loop functionality and firing events as always you can download the project files and utilities for free from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them see you next time
