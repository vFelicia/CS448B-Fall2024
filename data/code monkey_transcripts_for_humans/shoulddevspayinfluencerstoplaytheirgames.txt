00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K monkey So
00:02 - lately on Twitter there's been a really
00:04 - interesting discussion about whether or
00:06 - not Game Dev should pay for YouTube
00:08 - coverage YouTube or twitch any kind of
00:09 - creative coverage it's one of those
00:11 - things where there's been quite a bit of
00:13 - backlash but if you look through it
00:15 - there's actually quite an interesting
00:16 - discussion going on also before I go any
00:19 - further on this video let me just point
00:20 - out that Mike himself he posts out an
00:22 - apology he realizes now that he
00:24 - completely missed the mark and that he
00:26 - says that he absolutely does value the
00:27 - work that YouTuber and cont creators do
00:30 - and his original words did not reflect
00:31 - that at all so let's see what this whole
00:33 - discussion is about to learn from it but
00:35 - please don't go in ahead and harass any
00:36 - developer in the publisher the whole
00:38 - thing started off from this post from
00:40 - Mike Rose talking about the recently
00:42 - released game Spirit here and talking
00:44 - about how apparently it got zero
00:45 - coverage on YouTube at all and then the
00:47 - main one was right here which is
00:49 - basically YouTubers want you to pay them
00:50 - to cover your games but I just don't
00:52 - want to do that it feels weird and icky
00:54 - and disingenuous so this is the thing
00:56 - that caused a lot of backlash a lot of
00:57 - people got rightfully upset at this
00:59 - comment it does come across as quite a
01:01 - lot tonee especially how if you go to
01:04 - the top of this post this whole thread
01:05 - is basically broadcasting just how
01:07 - successful their game is how it made a
01:09 - million dollars in sales in just one
01:10 - week it was profitable from day one so
01:13 - this is a hyper successful game made
01:15 - tons and tons of money and Mike he's the
01:17 - CEO from no more robots this is another
01:19 - hyper successful publisher with tons and
01:22 - tons of very successful games so the
01:24 - senders was a big one hypnospace Outlaw
01:27 - that was another big one yeser gray very
01:29 - successful let's build zo very
01:30 - successful so tons of very successful
01:32 - indie games and again over here talking
01:34 - about just how successful the game is so
01:36 - yep that does come across as quite a lot
01:38 - toned def when then it says okay we made
01:40 - a ton of money we made millions of
01:42 - dollars but we don't want to pay any
01:43 - money to anyone covering our game on
01:45 - YouTube so because of that there was
01:47 - quite a lot of backlash for the most
01:49 - part people saw it as pretty much just
01:50 - disrespectful to people who cover indie
01:52 - games for a living and do it pretty much
01:54 - for free that is a really tough business
01:56 - it's nearly impossible to make money
01:57 - covering indie games but people do it
01:59 - anyways they do do it mostly for the
02:00 - love of it so the fact that those people
02:02 - are trying to get paid for the work that
02:03 - they do a lot of people consider that
02:05 - pretty reasonable so a game that is hper
02:07 - successful being unwilling to pay for
02:09 - any coverage at all and just calling it
02:11 - iy that does feel quite a lot tede
02:13 - honestly on this issue I think I can see
02:15 - both sides of it meaning I can obviously
02:17 - see that creators are extremely useful a
02:20 - Creator can definitely make or break in
02:21 - any game so I think creators especially
02:23 - nowadays are extremely valuable for the
02:25 - entire indie game ecosystem but at the
02:28 - same time I can also understand this
02:30 - feeling of making it feel icky and
02:31 - disingenuous I think the split over that
02:33 - comes basically on time Aaron who is
02:35 - also a very successful in developer made
02:38 - the very successful game race the Sun
02:40 - and many others he post what I think is
02:42 - pretty much exactly the reality which is
02:44 - how it's interesting how expectations
02:46 - around game coverage have changed in the
02:48 - last decade and Mike is really coming at
02:50 - it from the old school point of view
02:51 - that paying for coverage is considered
02:53 - scumming now for me I can definitely
02:55 - understand this point I remember when I
02:56 - started getting into game development
02:57 - and any games in general about 10 years
02:59 - ago ago and back then pay of for
03:01 - coverage did seem quite a bit
03:03 - disingenuous back then during the total
03:05 - biscuit days people covered games just
03:07 - were in love of it just for the love of
03:08 - indie games back then if a indie game
03:10 - developer sponsored a YouTuber to cover
03:12 - their game people would consider that to
03:14 - be pretty much selling out they would
03:16 - consider that to be a very negative
03:17 - thing I think the issue is back then
03:19 - players considered these kinds of videos
03:21 - to be sort of mini reviews so it
03:22 - definitely felt a bit strange to pay for
03:24 - a review it is also the simple thing
03:26 - that 10 years ago being a content
03:27 - creator that was not really a job nobody
03:29 - can that a job whereas nowadays it is a
03:31 - very viable career path then of course
03:33 - over time especially when the whole at
03:35 - apocalypse thing happened over here on
03:37 - YouTube when that happened it became
03:39 - hard and harder to make any sort of
03:40 - money by covering games especially indie
03:42 - games that don't usually get millions of
03:43 - views so because that content creators
03:45 - had to start taking things more like a
03:47 - proper business which in turn means
03:49 - obviously getting sponsored to do kinds
03:50 - of things so they can keep making videos
03:52 - so nowadays do seem pretty normal to pay
03:54 - for coverage if you go on Twitch anytime
03:56 - a big triaa game comes out now people do
03:59 - accept that those streams are going to
04:01 - be sponsored usually EA or Activision
04:04 - they always sponsor some streams when
04:05 - one of their new games comes out and
04:07 - nowadays players do accept that they
04:09 - don't consider that solid Behavior they
04:10 - just see okay that's just the Creator
04:12 - economy the Creator system nowadays one
04:14 - of the biggest people in this area
04:16 - specifically so indie games on YouTube
04:18 - one of the big ones is Splat cat gaming
04:20 - personally I really like watching this
04:22 - channel it's one of the main ways that I
04:23 - keep up to date with all the tons and
04:25 - endless games that are coming out the
04:26 - amount of Indie Games is just insane and
04:28 - all of these are really awesome so his
04:30 - channel is really important in order to
04:32 - help those IND developers stand out from
04:33 - the tons and tons of games that are
04:34 - coming out and he posted basically about
04:36 - that original thread how it's really
04:38 - disheartening to see some of the replies
04:40 - to that original post basically there
04:42 - are some people that got really upset
04:43 - that the original post said YouTubers
04:45 - shouldn't get paid and in turn there are
04:46 - some people really upset those people
04:48 - who don't consider YouTube to be a real
04:50 - job so they think they shouldn't
04:51 - complain that they don't get paid to
04:53 - play games which completely ignores the
04:55 - fact that being a content creator being
04:56 - a YouTuber a takes a lot of time and B
04:59 - is really Val valuable for these Indie
05:00 - Games hence why the publisher really
05:02 - wants the coverage but for some reason
05:03 - doesn't want to pay for it something
05:04 - that I've thought for a real long time
05:06 - that seem should really have are pretty
05:07 - much just the fil Lings one huge example
05:09 - is how splatter cat covered vampire
05:11 - survivors back then the game had like
05:13 - zero reviews nobody knew about the game
05:15 - and right after he made this video
05:17 - that's when the game really started to
05:18 - blow up so it is in pretty large part
05:20 - thanks to him that the game ended up
05:21 - making millions and millions of dollars
05:23 - but personally he probably only made
05:25 - like 200 bucks I mean indie games on
05:26 - YouTube they get a very low amount from
05:28 - YouTube ads so 200k views this might not
05:31 - even be 200 bucks so personally I really
05:33 - think that steam should add some kind of
05:35 - aili Link some kind of way for Content
05:37 - creators to be directly paid for the
05:39 - effort that they do and for basically
05:41 - driving eyeballs to the tons of IND
05:42 - games that exist on Steam I can say that
05:44 - for myself as both a game developer and
05:46 - a YouTuber I really value all of the
05:48 - YouTubers that ended up playing my game
05:50 - as soon as it was out I'm really
05:51 - thankful to these people who both played
05:53 - my game got some eyeballs onto it and
05:55 - seeing someone play actually really
05:56 - helped me as a developer being able to
05:58 - watch someone else play my game directly
05:59 - that is really helpful for being able to
06:01 - improve things that I didn't even know
06:03 - needed Improvement so I really really
06:05 - value the videos where people play my
06:06 - game then one very important thing that
06:09 - caused this backlash to be much worse is
06:11 - pretty much exactly the title and the
06:12 - screenshot that he chose to say it
06:14 - simultaneously says we got absolutely
06:16 - zero YouTube coverage at all whilst at
06:18 - the same time the screenshot does show
06:19 - 40K views 10K views 10K views and so on
06:22 - so once again this really comes across
06:23 - as toneev for most indie game devs
06:26 - getting someone to play their game and
06:27 - have 40,000 views on that video
06:30 - that is an insane amount that is really
06:31 - helpful but when you are a pretty
06:33 - massive indie game publisher 40K views
06:35 - is nothing so when he thinks about
06:37 - YouTube coverage she's thinking in the
06:38 - millions of views so once again that
06:40 - also comes across as really toned de you
06:42 - got tons of views but since they
06:43 - expected a ton more they completely
06:45 - devalue all of these content creators
06:46 - that are making videos on the game Aaron
06:48 - goes on to say I remember when the idea
06:49 - of a sponsor stream just seemed
06:51 - inherently Sleazy and some people even
06:53 - suggest YouTubers should be paying
06:54 - developers to use their content because
06:56 - in a lot of cases the videos made with
06:57 - content were hugely profitable this this
06:59 - back before the ad Apocalypse on YouTube
07:01 - where the ad rates for games were much
07:03 - much higher and his thre there's
07:04 - actually a really interesting comment
07:06 - related to this talking about the video
07:08 - in the original image and saying that
07:09 - video In His Image with 10K views
07:11 - probably took that created tons of time
07:12 - to make and they probably made 180 bucks
07:14 - on it now by itself that sounds pretty
07:16 - bad a ton of work to make just 180 bucks
07:19 - but the reality is actually much much
07:20 - worse than that and someone actually
07:22 - corrected them on that 10K views is
07:24 - nowhere close to 180 bucks I can speak
07:26 - to my own sets for example my list
07:28 - videos where I talk about the top new
07:29 - games and these videos the ad rate is
07:32 - usually a bit above $2 meaning 10K views
07:34 - literally mean just 30 bucks definitely
07:36 - not 180 bucks so the economics for
07:38 - streamers and YouTubers are even worse
07:40 - than it seems at first all in all I
07:42 - think this post by wonderbots is really
07:44 - the most accurate take on this whole
07:45 - situation he's saying in Mike's defense
07:47 - paying creators for coverage is iy game
07:50 - coverage is better when it's organic and
07:51 - while buying video streams will
07:53 - guarantee that they happen it also makes
07:54 - them feel less genuine which yep I would
07:56 - say that most viewers would agree with
07:57 - that if they see something that says
07:59 - sponsored by yay they're probably not
08:00 - going to take it as seriously as
08:02 - something that is organic but like it
08:04 - says here on the flip side sponsorships
08:05 - are becoming increasingly necessary
08:07 - covering IND the games is really not
08:08 - sustainable when it comes to just based
08:10 - on YouTube ad Revenue The Only Exception
08:12 - are super large channels like
08:14 - splattercat and even then the amount of
08:16 - money that he makes is so tiny compared
08:18 - to how much he could make based on the
08:19 - actual impact that he has on the games
08:21 - all in all this whole thing is an
08:22 - interesting discussion and I think the
08:23 - main takeaway is really just a time
08:25 - difference 10 years ago this comment
08:27 - would have been definitely accurate but
08:28 - nowadays it is definitely no longer
08:29 - accurate nowadays content creators are
08:31 - very much part of the whole indie game
08:33 - ecosystem and what they do is extremely
08:35 - valuable and I definitely do believe
08:37 - that they should get paid for that work
08:39 - the amount of value that they bring can
08:40 - definitely make a game like vampire
08:41 - survivors into a mega multi-million hit
08:43 - so I think it's perfectly reasonable for
08:45 - account creators to ask for some money
08:46 - in order to get some coverage although
08:48 - it's also perfectly reasonable if they
08:49 - don't want to take anything in order to
08:51 - satisfy their own personal Integrity
08:52 - requirements and it's also reasonable
08:54 - that some devs don't want or simply
08:56 - can't afford to pay for coverage basally
08:57 - in this whole thing I really just think
08:59 - the the only problem the only reason why
09:00 - this became such a big backlash on
09:02 - Twitter was really just because came
09:03 - across as really toned de talking about
09:05 - how successful your game is how many
09:06 - millions it made while also saying we
09:08 - really value the work that the YouTubers
09:10 - and twitch streamers do to cover our
09:12 - games but whilst we do value them we
09:14 - don't want to share any of these mels
09:15 - with them this is certainly a very
09:17 - interesting discussion and something
09:18 - that is definitely ongoing let me know
09:20 - in the comments what are your thoughts
09:21 - on this so should devs pay for coverage
09:24 - is it reasonable for a con Creator to
09:26 - ask for money in order to cover some
09:27 - kind of game it's kind of interesting to
09:29 - think about these topics and see how the
09:31 - whole Indie Game Dev industry this whole
09:33 - thing is still very much in its infancy
09:34 - and everyone is still learning as we all

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your K monkey So lately on Twitter there's been a really interesting discussion about whether or not Game Dev should pay for YouTube coverage YouTube or twitch any kind of creative coverage it's one of those things where there's been quite a bit of backlash but if you look through it there's actually quite an interesting discussion going on also before I go any further on this video let me just point out that Mike himself he posts out an apology he realizes now that he completely missed the mark and that he says that he absolutely does value the work that YouTuber and cont creators do and his original words did not reflect that at all so let's see what this whole discussion is about to learn from it but please don't go in ahead and harass any developer in the publisher the whole thing started off from this post from Mike Rose talking about the recently released game Spirit here and talking about how apparently it got zero coverage on YouTube at all and then the main one was right here which is basically YouTubers want you to pay them to cover your games but I just don't want to do that it feels weird and icky and disingenuous so this is the thing that caused a lot of backlash a lot of people got rightfully upset at this comment it does come across as quite a lot tonee especially how if you go to the top of this post this whole thread is basically broadcasting just how successful their game is how it made a million dollars in sales in just one week it was profitable from day one so this is a hyper successful game made tons and tons of money and Mike he's the CEO from no more robots this is another hyper successful publisher with tons and tons of very successful games so the senders was a big one hypnospace Outlaw that was another big one yeser gray very successful let's build zo very successful so tons of very successful indie games and again over here talking about just how successful the game is so yep that does come across as quite a lot toned def when then it says okay we made a ton of money we made millions of dollars but we don't want to pay any money to anyone covering our game on YouTube so because of that there was quite a lot of backlash for the most part people saw it as pretty much just disrespectful to people who cover indie games for a living and do it pretty much for free that is a really tough business it's nearly impossible to make money covering indie games but people do it anyways they do do it mostly for the love of it so the fact that those people are trying to get paid for the work that they do a lot of people consider that pretty reasonable so a game that is hper successful being unwilling to pay for any coverage at all and just calling it iy that does feel quite a lot tede honestly on this issue I think I can see both sides of it meaning I can obviously see that creators are extremely useful a Creator can definitely make or break in any game so I think creators especially nowadays are extremely valuable for the entire indie game ecosystem but at the same time I can also understand this feeling of making it feel icky and disingenuous I think the split over that comes basically on time Aaron who is also a very successful in developer made the very successful game race the Sun and many others he post what I think is pretty much exactly the reality which is how it's interesting how expectations around game coverage have changed in the last decade and Mike is really coming at it from the old school point of view that paying for coverage is considered
