00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and a while ago i mentioned how i picked
00:04 - up a bundle with some blender courses i
00:06 - had never touched blender before so i've
00:08 - been going through one of the courses
00:09 - and learning as i go along
00:11 - as a nice challenge i thought why don't
00:13 - i try putting what i've learned to the
00:14 - test and make a simple mini game all
00:16 - with my own assets
00:18 - that bundle is still active for a few
00:20 - more days so if you want to learn just
00:21 - like me go check them in the description
00:23 - i have 20 years of experience with
00:25 - programming but i'm a complete beginner
00:26 - with 3d modeling so i've just been
00:28 - following the course and practicing a
00:30 - bit in total i think i've spent about 10
00:32 - hours learning blender here i will
00:34 - showcase the progress that i've made and
00:35 - what i've managed to build even though
00:36 - i've only been learning for such a short
00:38 - time i'm also going to talk about
00:40 - several very important things related to
00:42 - just learning anything in general so
00:43 - make sure you keep watching starting off
00:45 - with actually a very important stage in
00:47 - the learning process when you actually
00:49 - use your skills that's when you really
00:51 - learn so my tip to you on your learning
00:53 - journey learning anything don't just
00:55 - watch tutorials or courses make little
00:58 - mini challenges like this one in order
00:59 - to practice your skills it will help you
01:01 - learn much much faster
01:03 - okay so here is the design that i came
01:05 - up with it's a sort of city traffic
01:07 - simulation game cars have a start and
01:10 - end point they start they drive around
01:12 - the road until they reach the end and
01:14 - despawn they test for collisions so they
01:16 - don't hit anything and i also made a
01:18 - traffic light system but actually
01:19 - removed that from the final game because
01:21 - i want to focus just on the 3d models
01:24 - right away you can see there's no
01:25 - visuals so i made this game entirely
01:27 - without any visuals just using cubes as
01:29 - placeholders
01:30 - making the game itself was pretty easy
01:32 - i'm already pretty good at making games
01:34 - with unity so the design and programming
01:36 - was the easy part for this challenge
01:38 - i actually record the entire making of
01:40 - this game so i might do an overview
01:42 - video on how i made this in this video i
01:44 - really want to focus just on the blender
01:46 - part so the first thing that i modeled
01:48 - was the house which seemed like it would
01:50 - be the easiest it went pretty well i'm
01:52 - quite pleased with the final result
01:54 - although i definitely messed up pretty
01:55 - massively by not using any reference
01:57 - images i just drew a house from my
02:00 - imagination and i don't have a very good
02:02 - visual imagination
02:03 - only now that i'm recording this
02:05 - voiceover that i realized that i didn't
02:06 - actually add any windows
02:08 - so the final model doesn't look quite a
02:10 - bit weird but still i quite like it one
02:13 - thing that tripped me up was a scale for
02:15 - my house i wanted to be 30 meters by 35
02:18 - meters so i just went into blender and
02:20 - scaled the default pointer q by 30 by 35
02:24 - however it turns out that the default
02:25 - blender cube is not one by one meters it
02:28 - is actually two by two so with a
02:30 - transform scale of one one the cube size
02:32 - is actually two two meaning that caused
02:34 - me to have my house model with double
02:36 - the size that was pretty confusing but i
02:39 - just made the transform half size in
02:40 - unity and it worked great
02:42 - after that i wanted to model a car so i
02:45 - started with a simple pickup truck
02:47 - this time i first searched for a
02:48 - reference image and actually found one
02:50 - from a nice side view
02:52 - modeling the car was definitely quite
02:54 - tricky i messed up a bunch of times and
02:56 - the model ended up with tons of
02:57 - invisible edges and separate faces i'm
03:00 - definitely very much a beginner in 3d
03:02 - modeling and i still don't know many
03:03 - things about how to make some proper
03:05 - topology
03:06 - also it took me quite a while to figure
03:08 - out that i should probably look for how
03:09 - to mirror meshes in blender
03:11 - i started off modeling both sides until
03:13 - i realized that was probably not the
03:15 - best approach also part of the reason
03:17 - for this video is really to show you how
03:18 - we all just start learning from nothing
03:20 - sometimes i see some comments in my
03:22 - videos where someone is discouraged
03:24 - because programming seems to come so
03:26 - easy to me well for them it's so very
03:27 - difficult but really that's the
03:29 - misleading picture of reality it's not
03:31 - because i'm special or anything it's
03:33 - just because i've been programming for
03:34 - over 20 years naturally the more
03:37 - experience you have the easier things
03:38 - become this video is a perfect example
03:40 - of how i'm starting 3d modeling right
03:42 - from the bottom this one is a skill that
03:44 - i know nothing about so i start off as a
03:46 - complete beginner and i'm slowly
03:48 - improving over time
03:49 - as long as i keep working on it i'm
03:51 - certain i will improve more and more and
03:53 - maybe in one year i will be able to make
03:54 - some decent models
03:56 - as another example of the same point for
03:58 - me as a blender beginner it took me
04:00 - about two hours to make this car
04:02 - whereas if you go on youtube there's a
04:04 - channel called infensia and he has some
04:06 - videos where he makes 10 unique cars in
04:08 - literally just 10 minutes that's a very
04:10 - visual example of the power of knowledge
04:12 - and the power of experience he probably
04:14 - has as much experience in blender as i
04:16 - do in programming so he's 10 times
04:18 - faster and produces a much much better
04:20 - result
04:21 - so with the pickup done next up i made a
04:23 - sporty car i used a lamborghini as a
04:26 - reference since they're already pre and
04:27 - low poly
04:28 - this one went quite a bit better i
04:30 - didn't have as many problems with
04:32 - invisible edges and vertices and i also
04:34 - knew about mirror from the start so i
04:36 - think this one came out actually pretty
04:38 - well
04:39 - then i made a building just some squares
04:42 - extruded inwards very basic
04:44 - also used mirrors so i really only
04:46 - modeled a single corner
04:48 - just involved subdividing the face and
04:49 - making a simple inset
04:51 - then i just replaced some of my ugly
04:53 - cubes with this building i also played
04:55 - around with the collar to get some
04:56 - variety and i played around with the
04:58 - windows first i tried a solid collar
05:01 - then tried making them fully reflective
05:02 - and finally just making them glow i
05:04 - think the final one looks pretty good
05:06 - next up i made the environment around
05:08 - the city basically just a bunch of hills
05:11 - so i just made a cube with tons of faces
05:13 - then just raising a bunch of them
05:15 - painting them green and i place them
05:16 - randomly
05:17 - and over here is the final game you can
05:19 - see pretty huge difference between the
05:21 - completely empty scene and this one even
05:23 - though this one just has some basic
05:24 - meshes
05:25 - so oh no of course i still have a lot to
05:28 - learn but honestly i'm very happy with
05:30 - what i've learned in such a short amount
05:31 - of time
05:32 - my goal isn't to become a pro 3d modeler
05:35 - i'm still going to primarily buy assets
05:37 - from actual professional 3d modelers i
05:40 - really just want to know the basics so i
05:41 - can modify some of the assets that i buy
05:43 - and maybe make some things that i can't
05:45 - find anywhere for example when i made my
05:47 - factory mini game i had to couple
05:49 - together the buildings from tons of
05:51 - random parts
05:52 - and of course i couldn't find anything
05:54 - for making a specific grabber or a
05:56 - conveyor belt so that's the kind of
05:58 - unique things that i want to be able to
05:59 - model also my goal with this video is
06:01 - really to let you know that you can
06:02 - always learn anything only takes this
06:04 - time but as long as you put in the time
06:06 - you can really learn anything so you can
06:08 - learn 3d modeling you can learn drawing
06:10 - programming game development machine
06:12 - learning video editing literally
06:14 - anything
06:15 - as you can see i had never touched 3d
06:17 - modeling and in just a few hours i
06:18 - actually learned a decent amount
06:20 - so if there's something you've been
06:22 - wanting to learn then go ahead and give
06:23 - it a go all it takes is just doing the
06:25 - first app and then keep at it the more
06:27 - you practice the better you become
06:29 - as for me i'm going to continue learning
06:31 - blender a bit more
06:32 - i'm not trying to become a pro 3d
06:34 - modeler but i'd like to be able to make
06:35 - some simple low-poly things and so far
06:37 - so good
06:38 - if you're like me and you also wouldn't
06:40 - like to learn blender you can pick up
06:41 - the same bundle that i picked up
06:43 - it contains since of courses i've been
06:45 - following this one just learning the
06:47 - absolute basics of blender
06:49 - then there's also this one over here
06:50 - about making low poly characters i want
06:52 - to go through this one afterwards
06:54 - then there's also one about making some
06:56 - landscapes making some pics and learned
06:58 - how to get a job in the gamedev industry
07:00 - how to draw and so on so if you're like
07:02 - me and you'd like to learn just go ahead
07:04 - and check the link description
07:05 - alright so this was a very different
07:07 - video from the usual but i hope seeing
07:09 - my learning journey as a complete
07:11 - beginner was helpful so thank you for
07:13 - watching and i'll see you next time

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and a while ago i mentioned how i picked up a bundle with some blender courses i had never touched blender before so i've been going through one of the courses
