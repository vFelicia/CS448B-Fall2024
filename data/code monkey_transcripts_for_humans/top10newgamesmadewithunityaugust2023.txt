00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - now before I start this video given
00:04 - everything that is going on I feel the
00:05 - need for a quick disclaimer whatever you
00:07 - think of unity as a company don't take
00:09 - it out on these devs making awesome
00:10 - games whatever the company behind does
00:12 - the tool itself is still excellent when
00:14 - put in the hands of self creators I've
00:16 - been making this series covering the top
00:17 - new games every month and I plan to
00:19 - continue doing it for as long as devs
00:21 - are building awesome things with the
00:22 - engine and here let's check out the top
00:23 - new games made with the UNT launch on
00:25 - August 23. this was another Banker month
00:27 - really tricky to pick just 10 games I
00:29 - guess a lot of Indies wanted to quickly
00:31 - launch in August before star film took
00:33 - up everyone's time in September this
00:35 - month the first game is a really great
00:37 - story of a small Indie Dev finding
00:39 - massive success and then the last game
00:40 - that one is another absolutely excellent
00:42 - game but suddenly also comes with some
00:44 - bad news the reason why I make these
00:46 - videos is to show you everything the
00:47 - engine can do the only limit is really
00:48 - just your own skills and Imagination and
00:50 - the variety and the awesomeness of the
00:52 - game shown here really puts out the test
00:53 - all of these games are unically
00:55 - impressive so the list is in no
00:56 - particular order except for the number
00:57 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:59 - month also I'm currently working on my
01:00 - own Sim game Thinking Guardians it's a
01:02 - fun game with automation Colony building
01:04 - and defense mechanics where you can
01:06 - build a colony you can automate it and
01:08 - keep the tiny defense on Slinky safe
01:09 - from harm there's a freedom where you
01:11 - can try out the release date is
01:12 - happening just next month so go ahead
01:14 - add it to your wishlist and phone for
01:15 - that ones alright so starting off at
01:17 - number 10 with a really awesome game
01:19 - made by a fellow gamedev YouTuber Jonas
01:21 - Tyrone despite being so young he has
01:23 - already had such an interesting career
01:24 - first he made a huge hit with unity with
01:27 - the game Islanders then he switched the
01:28 - game maker for Willing snail and now
01:30 - he's back to Unity with throngfall the
01:32 - game is a minimalist tower defense game
01:34 - basically they took the genre to its
01:36 - Bare Bones Basics and made that really
01:38 - satisfying you build up your Colony
01:40 - build some Mills together gold build
01:42 - some houses for troops use the coins to
01:44 - build up your Castle build some defenses
01:45 - gather more resources and create your
01:47 - army then the Night Comes the enemies
01:49 - attack and you can defend either by
01:51 - yourself or with your army it's a very
01:53 - minimalist but very satisfying game and
01:55 - it's already a massive hit over 5 000
01:58 - extremely positive reviews even though
01:59 - it it's only an early access that means
02:01 - it has probably sold already over 150
02:04 - 000 copies meaning already past 1
02:06 - million dollars in Revenue I've picked
02:08 - the game myself both to support Jonas
02:10 - and because it actually looks right up
02:12 - my alley I can't wait to find time to
02:13 - play it and if you're wondering is the
02:15 - game ahead just because of his YouTube
02:16 - channel the answer is not exactly I mean
02:18 - the channel certainly helps his devlogs
02:20 - are excellent and they get tons of views
02:22 - but more importantly his game really
02:24 - blew up in the last team nextfest he
02:26 - literally got a hundred thousand
02:27 - wishlists thanks to an excellent demo so
02:29 - if you doubt the power of steam
02:31 - festivals and wishlists and this is
02:32 - Clear Proof of just how much it matters
02:34 - so really huge congrats to Jonas this is
02:36 - a well-deserved massive hit on an
02:38 - excellent game next for an interesting
02:39 - one here is I am future a cozy
02:42 - apocalypse survival nowadays it's really
02:44 - hard to come up with a good name for a
02:45 - game but for this one the name really
02:47 - says it all it hooks you right away cozy
02:49 - apocalypse survival that's certainly a
02:51 - very unique twist despite being an
02:52 - unboxing lips game it looks very jolly
02:55 - very inviting with some very English
02:56 - Greenery it is also set on top of a
02:58 - skyscraper so that's an another thing
03:00 - that makes it quite unique among the Sea
03:02 - of survival games you can do some
03:04 - cooking some resource Gathering do some
03:06 - crafting farming fishing and so on so
03:08 - all the usual stuff then you can also
03:09 - create some robots and have them do all
03:11 - the work when they relax so it also has
03:13 - some nice automation elements and then
03:15 - you can explore this world and uncover
03:16 - the mystery behind why the apocalypse
03:18 - happen this is definitely a great fresh
03:20 - take on a very saturated genre it is out
03:22 - now in Early Access with already over a
03:24 - thousand very positive reviews then for
03:26 - a very dark ingredient in the sequel
03:28 - here is Blasphemous too it's a difficult
03:30 - punishing dark and greedy to the
03:32 - metroidvania if you like gorgeous pixel
03:34 - art then you will definitely enjoy this
03:35 - one it's got some really gorgeous art
03:37 - and animations the game also has some
03:39 - great 2D size rolling action people
03:40 - refer to this one and the prequel as 2D
03:43 - Dark Souls you can customize and improve
03:45 - your skill set you can equip various
03:47 - weapons and Master on the attacks you
03:48 - explore this huge unique world and
03:50 - engage in intense Boss Battles the story
03:52 - continues from the first one so you
03:53 - should probably play that one first if
03:55 - you're into the story but if you're just
03:56 - into 2D science rolling zones like
03:58 - gameplay then you can probably just jump
04:00 - into this one it is actually
04:01 - surprisingly expensive for a 2d size
04:03 - rolling game it's 30 bucks but it also
04:05 - already has over 2500 very positive
04:07 - views so it seems like the price is very
04:09 - well Justified next for something full
04:11 - of color here is Bomb brush cyberfunk
04:13 - this one is somewhat of a spiritual
04:15 - successor to Jet Set Radio you can
04:18 - immediately see that just by looking at
04:19 - a screenshot that's actually one game
04:21 - that I as a kid I thought was really
04:22 - awesome and I really wanted to play it
04:24 - but I never had a Dreamcast so I
04:26 - couldn't in this one you can ride a
04:27 - skateboard a bike or rollerblades you
04:30 - complete awesome tricks get tons of
04:31 - sound points paint some graffiti do some
04:34 - break dancing and fight the military
04:35 - police honestly there's actually
04:37 - something that I would have guessed is
04:38 - very Niche but apparently not it's
04:40 - already a huge hit with over 5000
04:42 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so if
04:44 - you're looking for something pretty
04:45 - unique then definitely give this one a
04:47 - shot then if you want some super
04:48 - fast-paced action check out turbo
04:50 - Overkill nowadays there are quite a lot
04:52 - of Boomer Shooters and this one seems
04:54 - like an absolutely excellent one it is
04:56 - extremely fast paced really non-stop
04:58 - moving and shooting you can do on Wheels
05:00 - SMGs you can pick up some powerful
05:02 - shotguns or some huge rockets and take
05:04 - out tons of enemies there's lots of
05:06 - bullets and blood flying all over the
05:08 - place the environments also seem
05:10 - extremely unique some look like hell so
05:12 - something straight out of Doom but
05:13 - others look like outer space and some
05:15 - look straight out of cyberpunk it can
05:17 - also drive a motorbike do some cool
05:19 - slides and shoot at the same time so if
05:21 - you're into this genre definitely go
05:23 - ahead and give this a try it already has
05:24 - over 3 000 overwhelmingly positive views
05:27 - so this one is a huge hit and people
05:29 - love it for some VR here is a curious
05:31 - one with a strange name it's called
05:33 - project third eye it's a VR physics
05:36 - interaction game with lots of player
05:37 - creativity so you've got regular
05:39 - shooting like normal but then you can
05:41 - also pick up some planks of wood and
05:43 - connect them together then you can pick
05:45 - up a circuit board you can attach it to
05:47 - the object and write some logic using
05:48 - some nice visual scripting it's
05:50 - certainly an interesting idea that has
05:51 - potential anytime you had code mixed
05:54 - with some objects it always makes for
05:55 - some interesting stuff although the
05:57 - reviews mention how it's a bit Bare
05:59 - Bones right now it's out in Early Access
06:00 - so perhaps keep an eye on this one over
06:02 - the coming months next if you're into
06:04 - nice airships and RPGs here is black
06:07 - scallions it's a top-down open world
06:09 - Airship management and combat game you
06:11 - fly around in your Airship and rescue
06:13 - friends or fight enemies you can pick
06:15 - from dozens of unique weapons choose
06:17 - from regular rifles or some special
06:19 - unique lighting weapons you also have
06:21 - different ships to choose from so will
06:23 - you pick something that is fast and
06:24 - Nimble or something slow and Powerful
06:26 - gather some resources and use them to
06:28 - upgrade your ship and your weapons
06:30 - explore a huge open world and liberate
06:32 - each island one by one while also
06:34 - encountering some unique missions and
06:36 - some unique NPCs visually it's got some
06:38 - really great gorgeous pixel art I
06:39 - especially love the explosions really
06:41 - bright very fiery personally I'm also
06:43 - always very interested to see in this
06:45 - second open world games so this is
06:47 - definitely appealing to me it has just
06:48 - graduated from Early Access and it's got
06:50 - over 1500 very positive reviews then for
06:53 - something that was already a huge hit
06:55 - and finally came to PC it's Marvel snap
06:57 - you've probably already heard of it it's
06:59 - one of the biggest mobile hits of the
07:01 - past few years personally I don't
07:02 - normally game on my phone but I've been
07:04 - interested in everything that I've heard
07:05 - about this game so I'm definitely happy
07:07 - to see it on PC the game itself is a
07:09 - card game with tons and tons of Marvel
07:11 - characters everything from the super
07:12 - popular ones is some very Niche very
07:14 - underground ones you collect all the
07:16 - heroes from the entirety of Marvel so
07:18 - that's really hundreds of unique
07:20 - superheroes and characters upgrade your
07:21 - cards head up your deck and do battle
07:23 - with other players as a Dev I would say
07:25 - you should probably play this game if
07:27 - not just to study the excellent polish
07:29 - every action in this game looks so
07:31 - extremely satisfying the cards are
07:33 - gorgeous very well built and every
07:34 - action is filled with excellent
07:36 - animations and effects it is free to
07:38 - play which for me is usually a bad thing
07:39 - but from what I've heard the
07:40 - monetization on this one seems pretty
07:42 - well done it is out now on seam and
07:44 - already has 17 000 very positive reviews
07:46 - then if you're into gorgeous adventure
07:48 - games here is a guidebook of Babel I
07:51 - really like the style on this one hand
07:52 - drawn in a really nice way you walk
07:54 - around and explore this world talk to
07:56 - NPCs and pick up quests to hunt them in
07:58 - their hour of need search for for Clues
08:00 - put together clues in your notebook and
08:02 - solve the mystery then go back in time
08:04 - and prevent the problem from ever
08:05 - happening however in doing so that will
08:07 - actually create a butterfly effect with
08:09 - lots of unintended consequences so the
08:11 - next time you go through the story
08:12 - things are going to be slightly
08:14 - different definitely seems like a very
08:15 - inventive mechanic for an adventure game
08:17 - it is out now with 300 reviews at 98
08:19 - positive so if you're a fan of this
08:21 - genre then definitely this looks like a
08:23 - great new one and at number one for my
08:25 - personal pick of the month here is
08:26 - Shadow Gambit the curse crew this is by
08:28 - the same developer that made Shadow
08:30 - tactics Blades of the Shogun and the
08:32 - really excellent Desperados 3. I finally
08:34 - got the time to play that one last month
08:36 - and I absolutely loved it I love these
08:37 - games I don't love this developer if
08:39 - you're not familiar these are stealth
08:41 - Action games you control a group of
08:43 - unique characters each with unique
08:44 - abilities all the enemies have their
08:46 - Patron routes they have very strict view
08:48 - cones and a very strict set of rules
08:50 - basically it's a game of perfect
08:52 - information there's no Randomness you
08:54 - can assess the world make a plan and
08:55 - execute if you're good you won't succeed
08:58 - right away but at the same time if you
08:59 - fail that's all right failure is
09:01 - absolutely part of the game that is why
09:02 - the game has a super fast quick save and
09:04 - quick load system you are supposed to do
09:06 - a quick save then try out your plan and
09:09 - if it fails you can either try to
09:10 - continue or simply quick move personally
09:12 - I always get stressed when I play some
09:14 - self games because failure is usually
09:15 - very punishing so I do love this system
09:18 - it feels absolutely excellent to queue
09:20 - up some actions on multiple characters
09:21 - then press a button to execute them all
09:24 - at once and watch as your plan goes to
09:26 - Perfection this one is all about Pirates
09:27 - and lots of awkward elements it is not
09:30 - meant to be realistic like their
09:31 - previous games which really allows them
09:33 - to play with some more otherworldly
09:34 - elements and abilities it is out now
09:36 - with 1500 reviews at 95 positive so this
09:40 - is a huge hit and people love it
09:41 - although even though this game is
09:43 - excellent sadly it comes with some bad
09:44 - news the developer actually disbanded
09:46 - right after release it looks like it's
09:48 - owned well and in the final message they
09:50 - mentioned how they're actually paying a
09:51 - bonus to their workers based on the
09:53 - profits so suddenly it just seems like
09:55 - the reason is making a game of this
09:56 - quality is really difficult especially
09:58 - on such a niche genre even though the
10:00 - final result is excellent it does seem
10:02 - like it took quite a bit of tone on the
10:03 - developers personally as someone who
10:05 - doesn't really have work-life balance I
10:07 - can definitely sympathize with that I
10:08 - can admire their decision to Value the
10:10 - well-being of the team as opposed to
10:12 - starting on another massive project
10:13 - right away while at the same time I'm
10:15 - very sad that they shut down there's no
10:16 - one else making games in this excellent
10:18 - but very nice genre and they had
10:20 - completely mastered it so I really wish
10:22 - the best to the rest of the team who
10:23 - knows maybe some of these Sim members
10:25 - will take that bonus and start their own
10:27 - Studio to continue this Legacy alright
10:29 - so that's 10 awesome new games made with
10:30 - the Indian launch in August 23 I hope
10:33 - this list on DC how DMT engine is
10:34 - capable of building anything the limits
10:36 - are really just your own skills and
10:37 - Imagination check out my own gaming
10:39 - Guardians and edit your wishlist

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey now before I start this video given everything that is going on I feel the need for a quick disclaimer whatever you think of unity as a company don't take it out on these devs making awesome games whatever the company behind does the tool itself is still excellent when put in the hands of self creators I've been making this series covering the top new games every month and I plan to continue doing it for as long as devs are building awesome things with the engine and here let's check out the top new games made with the UNT launch on August 23. this was another Banker month really tricky to pick just 10 games I guess a lot of Indies wanted to quickly launch in August before star film took up everyone's time in September this month the first game is a really great story of a small Indie Dev finding massive success and then the last game that one is another absolutely excellent game but suddenly also comes with some bad news the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out the test all of these games are unically impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also I'm currently working on my own Sim game Thinking Guardians it's a fun game with automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you can build a colony you can automate it and keep the tiny defense on Slinky safe from harm there's a freedom where you can try out the release date is happening just next month so go ahead add it to your wishlist and phone for that ones alright so starting off at number 10 with a really awesome game made by a fellow gamedev YouTuber Jonas Tyrone despite being so young he has already had such an interesting career first he made a huge hit with unity with the game Islanders then he switched the game maker for Willing snail and now he's back to Unity with throngfall the game is a minimalist tower defense game basically they took the genre to its Bare Bones Basics and made that really satisfying you build up your Colony build some Mills together gold build some houses for troops use the coins to build up your Castle build some defenses gather more resources and create your army then the Night Comes the enemies attack and you can defend either by yourself or with your army it's a very minimalist but very satisfying game and it's already a massive hit over 5 000 extremely positive reviews even though it it's only an early access that means it has probably sold already over 150 000 copies meaning already past 1 million dollars in Revenue I've picked the game myself both to support Jonas and because it actually looks right up my alley I can't wait to find time to play it and if you're wondering is the game ahead just because of his YouTube channel the answer is not exactly I mean the channel certainly helps his devlogs are excellent and they get tons of views but more importantly his game really blew up in the last team nextfest he literally got a hundred thousand wishlists thanks to an excellent demo so if you doubt the power of steam festivals and wishlists and this is Clear Proof of just how much it matters so really huge congrats to Jonas this is a welldeserved massive hit on an excellent game next for an interesting one here is I am future a cozy apocalypse survival nowadays it's really hard to come up with a good name for a game but for this one the name really says it all it hooks you right away cozy apocalypse survival that's certainly a very unique twist despite being an unboxing lips game it looks very jolly very inviting with some very English Greenery it is also set on top of a skyscraper so that's an another thing that makes it quite unique among the Sea of survival games you can do some cooking some resource Gathering do some crafting farming fishing and so on so all the usual stuff then you can also create some robots and have them do all the work when they relax so it also has some nice automation elements and then you can explore this world and uncover the mystery behind why the apocalypse happen this is definitely a great fresh take on a very saturated genre it is out now in Early Access with already over a thousand very positive reviews then for a very dark ingredient in the sequel here is Blasphemous too it's a difficult punishing dark and greedy to the metroidvania if you like gorgeous pixel art then you will definitely enjoy this one it's got some really gorgeous art and animations the game also has some great 2D size rolling action people refer to this one and the prequel as 2D Dark Souls you can customize and improve your skill set you can equip various weapons and Master on the attacks you explore this huge unique world and engage in intense Boss Battles the story continues from the first one so you should probably play that one first if you're into the story but if you're just into 2D science rolling zones like gameplay then you can probably just jump into this one it is actually surprisingly expensive for a 2d size rolling game it's 30 bucks but it also already has over 2500 very positive views so it seems like the price is very well Justified next for something full of color here is Bomb brush cyberfunk this one is somewhat of a spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio you can immediately see that just by looking at a screenshot that's actually one game that I as a kid I thought was really awesome and I really wanted to play it but I never had a Dreamcast so I couldn't in this one you can ride a skateboard a bike or rollerblades you complete awesome tricks get tons of sound points paint some graffiti do some break dancing and fight the military police honestly there's actually something that I would have guessed is very Niche but apparently not it's already a huge hit with over 5000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you're looking for something pretty unique then definitely give this one a shot then if you want some super fastpaced action check out turbo Overkill nowadays there are quite a lot of Boomer Shooters and this one seems like an absolutely excellent one it is extremely fast paced really nonstop moving and shooting you can do on Wheels SMGs you can pick up some powerful shotguns or some huge rockets and take out tons of enemies there's lots of bullets and blood flying all over the place the environments also seem extremely unique some look like hell so something straight out of Doom but others look like outer space and some look straight out of cyberpunk it can also drive a motorbike do some cool slides and shoot at the same time so if you're into this genre definitely go ahead and give this a try it already has over 3 000 overwhelmingly positive views so this one is a huge hit and people love it for some VR here is a curious one with a strange name it's called project third eye it's a VR physics interaction game with lots of player creativity so you've got regular shooting like normal but then you can also pick up some planks of wood and connect them together then you can pick up a circuit board you can attach it to the object and write some logic using some nice visual scripting it's certainly an interesting idea that has potential anytime you had code mixed with some objects it always makes for some interesting stuff although the reviews mention how it's a bit Bare Bones right now it's out in Early Access so perhaps keep an eye on this one over the coming months next if you're into nice airships and RPGs here is black scallions it's a topdown open world Airship management and combat game you fly around in your Airship and rescue friends or fight enemies you can pick from dozens of unique weapons choose from regular rifles or some special unique lighting weapons you also have different ships to choose from so will you pick something that is fast and Nimble or something slow and Powerful gather some resources and use them to upgrade your ship and your weapons explore a huge open world and liberate each island one by one while also encountering some unique missions and some unique NPCs visually it's got some really great gorgeous pixel art I especially love the explosions really bright very fiery personally I'm also always very interested to see in this second open world games so this is definitely appealing to me it has just graduated from Early Access and it's got over 1500 very positive reviews then for something that was already a huge hit and finally came to PC it's Marvel snap you've probably already heard of it it's one of the biggest mobile hits of the past few years

butterfly effect with lots of unintended consequences so the next time you go through the story things are going to be slightly different definitely seems like a very inventive mechanic for an adventure game it is out now with 300 reviews at 98 positive so if you're a fan of this genre then definitely this looks like a great new one and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is Shadow Gambit the curse crew this is by the same developer that made Shadow tactics Blades of the Shogun and the really excellent Desperados 3. I finally got the time to play that one last month and I absolutely loved it I love these games I don't love this developer if you're not familiar these are stealth Action games you control a group of unique characters each with unique abilities all the enemies have their Patron routes they have very strict view cones and a very strict set of rules basically it's a game of perfect information there's no Randomness you can assess the world make a plan and execute if you're good you won't succeed right away but at the same time if you fail that's all right failure is absolutely part of the game that is why the game has a super fast quick save and quick load system you are supposed to do a quick save then try out your plan and if it fails you can either try to continue or simply quick move personally I always get stressed when I play some self games because failure is usually very punishing so I do love this system it feels absolutely excellent to queue up some actions on multiple characters then press a button to execute them all at once and watch as your plan goes to Perfection this one is all about Pirates and lots of awkward elements it is not meant to be realistic like their previous games which really allows them to play with some more otherworldly elements and abilities it is out now with 1500 reviews at 95 positive so this is a huge hit and people love it although even though this game is excellent sadly it comes with some bad news the developer actually disbanded right after release it looks like it's owned well and in the final message they mentioned how they're actually paying a bonus to their workers based on the profits so suddenly it just seems like the reason is making a game of this quality is really difficult especially on such a niche genre even though the final result is excellent it does seem like it took quite a bit of tone on the developers personally as someone who doesn't really have worklife balance I can definitely sympathize with that I can admire their decision to Value the wellbeing of the team as opposed to starting on another massive project right away while at the same time I'm very sad that they shut down there's no one else making games in this excellent but very nice genre and they had completely mastered it so I really wish the best to the rest of the team who knows maybe some of these Sim members will take that bonus and start their own Studio to continue this Legacy alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the Indian launch in August 23 I hope this list on DC how DMT engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own gaming Guardians and edit your wishlist
