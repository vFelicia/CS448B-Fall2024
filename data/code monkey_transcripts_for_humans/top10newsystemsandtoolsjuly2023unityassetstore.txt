00:57 - starting off with a massive update to an
00:59 - already existing excellent tool it's
01:02 - text animator version 2. this is one
01:04 - that I've had on my list to do a phone
01:05 - review for quite some time I've used it
01:07 - a tiny bit and what I saw was awesome
01:09 - basically it's a tune to really help you
01:11 - make your Tech stand out you can add all
01:13 - kinds of effects and animations you can
01:15 - make it wave Shake rotate you can make
01:17 - it change colors fade bounce and tons
01:19 - more pretty much every single game has
01:21 - text and a tool like this one can really
01:22 - help you polish that text this one is a
01:24 - very robust deal that has already been
01:26 - used in production in several excellent
01:28 - successful games things like slime
01:30 - Rancher packling and conflict lamp
01:32 - version 2.0 is a massive update which is
01:34 - almost a complete rewrite whilst adding
01:36 - tons of new features things like editor
01:38 - preview new effects and a bunch more I
01:40 - believe this massive update is free at
01:42 - least for me it already showed up on my
01:44 - account so if you already have it go see
01:46 - what is new and if you don't then
01:47 - definitely look into it it's an
01:49 - excellent tool that can really help your
01:50 - game shine up next here's a massive
01:52 - shooter game kit if you want to quickly
01:54 - make a shooter then this one would be an
01:55 - excellent starting point the name says
01:57 - primarily third person but it also
01:59 - supports first person it features some
02:01 - realistic Locomotion with Dynamic
02:03 - rotation and breakdowns it's got ik foot
02:05 - placement that it works on any terrain
02:07 - it includes multiple pre-made game
02:09 - sounds things like regular third person
02:11 - top down two and a half D side scroller
02:13 - and first person the weapon system is
02:15 - also very robust with physical bullets
02:17 - dual wielding Ricochet and melee weapon
02:19 - support it includes an inventory cross
02:21 - platform controls gravity system vehicle
02:24 - controls Ai and a bunch more it's super
02:26 - easy to get started just drag and drop
02:28 - the character and that's it also
02:29 - features extensive documentation which
02:31 - is super important for a company
02:32 - accessor like this one oh no it looks
02:34 - like an extremely complete package so if
02:36 - there's some shooter game idea that
02:37 - you'd like to quickly prototype then
02:39 - this can be quite useful up next here is
02:41 - one that is simultaneously just a visual
02:43 - but also a tool it's a level and volcano
02:45 - environment this one is visually
02:47 - gorgeous super high quality assets with
02:49 - some super complex shaders looking at
02:51 - this makes me want to make a game
02:52 - inspired by something like Mount Doom or
02:54 - perhaps recreate that iconic Star Wars
02:56 - scene it includes a bunch of tunes to
02:58 - really customize it there's a a spline
03:00 - tool to control the flow of the lever
03:02 - you can create Rivers roads and cliffs
03:04 - there's a tune for generating lakes or
03:06 - endlesses it includes nine demo scenes
03:08 - so you can see it in action in all sorts
03:10 - of environments so if you need some
03:11 - gorgeous level system definitely look
03:12 - into it or if you'd like to research
03:14 - foam apps then this also looks like
03:15 - great asset to research then if you want
03:17 - to make your game more performant look
03:19 - at this FSR package FSR means Fidelity
03:22 - super resolution it's an AI upscaling
03:24 - technique this technique is built by AMD
03:26 - but as far as I know it works on most
03:28 - Nvidia cards this can be excellent for
03:30 - making your game performant without
03:31 - sacrificing much visual quality in case
03:33 - you don't know on the render pipeline
03:35 - asset you can actually modify the render
03:36 - scale so one way to improve performance
03:38 - if your game is GPU bottlenecked would
03:40 - be to unlover that render scale and then
03:42 - use this tune to bring the visuals back
03:44 - up it is really easy to use you just add
03:45 - a component and it's done so this is a
03:47 - great option if you have some
03:49 - performance issues next for another
03:50 - visual tool here is planar Reflections
03:52 - this one lets you add real-time
03:54 - Reflections to your game if you don't
03:55 - know Unity only supports big Reflections
03:58 - by default if you have dynamic objects
04:00 - they will not show up on the reflections
04:01 - now in the description they don't
04:03 - mention what technique they're using
04:04 - they mention performance so I assume
04:06 - these are screen space Reflections and
04:08 - not Ray traced visually they look great
04:10 - and it also looks super easy to use you
04:11 - just have the component and play with
04:13 - the settings there's tons of options to
04:15 - modify Reflections is one thing that can
04:17 - really help your game look much better
04:18 - and unity's limitation of only being
04:20 - baked really limits things so this film
04:22 - is a great way to push your visuals to
04:24 - the next level then if you'd like to
04:25 - make a time of day system or some
04:27 - weather then look at this one it
04:29 - includes quite a lot of options you can
04:30 - change from day into night it even has a
04:33 - procedural Skybox that looks really
04:35 - great even the Moon is procedural you
04:37 - can watch as the sun rises and sets
04:39 - while changing the entire lighting
04:40 - there's also a weather system which
04:42 - supports rainfall with some nice water
04:43 - puddles and droplets then that water can
04:46 - be dried with a sunny weather or you can
04:48 - set up some snowfall which slowly fills
04:50 - up the world it includes two shaders for
04:52 - the weather there's a regular Shader and
04:54 - a stylized one adding a day night second
04:55 - like this one is one of those things
04:57 - that can really help you polish your
04:58 - game next here is a simple tool that
05:00 - does exactly what it says Google Sheets
05:02 - to Json to c-sharp basically you can
05:04 - Define all of your data in a Google
05:06 - sheet then with a button click easily
05:08 - import into your game and have access to
05:10 - all that data from a simple C sharp plus
05:12 - so like I said it does exactly one task
05:14 - and does it very well this can be
05:15 - extremely useful if you're working with
05:17 - a designer or if you yourself like to
05:19 - design all kinds of numbers on a Google
05:20 - sheet that workflow can sometimes be
05:22 - great when you need to balance tons and
05:24 - tons of values with this you can do all
05:26 - of that balancing work in a simple
05:27 - spreadsheet and then easily import all
05:29 - of it into your game then since a while
05:31 - ago we saw some lava now here is some
05:33 - water it's a water system for urp Unity
05:35 - has actually been working on an
05:37 - impressive water system but so far it's
05:39 - hrp only so this one looks like a great
05:41 - alternative if you're working in urp
05:43 - visually it looks really great nice
05:45 - waves nice foam it's got subsurface
05:47 - scattering and refraction includes cut
05:49 - out volume so the home of your ship
05:51 - stays right you can also Place water
05:52 - within water if for some reason you need
05:55 - to do that you can add some nice
05:56 - customizable Ripple Trails also include
05:58 - some highly performance buoyancy physics
06:00 - and some nice underwater caustics so
06:03 - this really looks like an extremely
06:04 - Complete feature-rich Water System
06:06 - definitely give it a look if you need
06:07 - some water next for a UI tool here is a
06:10 - complete modular kit this one includes a
06:12 - ton of stuff you can customize your
06:13 - layouts you can define color palettes
06:15 - includes a ton of icons in both color
06:18 - and black and white every element is
06:20 - carefully organized to make it easy to
06:21 - find what you're looking for there's
06:23 - lots of pre-bone prefabs to make it easy
06:25 - to get started so you've got pop-ups
06:27 - sliders buttons toggles scroll areas
06:29 - tooltips and gradients it even include
06:30 - scene fade in and Fade Out effects this
06:33 - is really one of those tunes that is
06:34 - massive which might require some time to
06:36 - learn but if you learn it it can make
06:37 - you very productive I can see this being
06:39 - great if you're constantly building tons
06:41 - of new projects then here we have one to
06:43 - help you animate things easier the unity
06:45 - animation window is actually pretty
06:46 - basic now I'm no animator but I have
06:49 - always found the animation curve Editor
06:50 - to be really tricky to use and this the
06:52 - only is meant to exactly help Santa
06:54 - features a very robust curve editor you
06:57 - can edit multiple keyframes at once
06:59 - which is super helpful you can create
07:00 - all sorts of presets you quickly select
07:03 - any action you want so if you like
07:04 - animating directly inside DNT then this
07:06 - looks quite useful alright so those are
07:08 - my top 10 new tools and systems on the
07:10 - NTS server for July 23 there's links to
07:12 - all in the description and as a bonus
07:14 - you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to
07:15 - get 10 off your order also check out my
07:17 - own free pass on the store alright hope
07:19 - that's useful check out these videos to
07:21 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
