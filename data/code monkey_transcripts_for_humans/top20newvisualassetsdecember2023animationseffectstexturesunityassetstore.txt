01:27 - game where these are the enemies
01:28 - populating the world you can get this

01:31 - individually then if you're making
01:33 - something in first person and you need
01:34 - some animations check out this one this

01:41 - running jumping shooting blocking
01:43 - inspecting the weapon and so on this dev
01:45 - has tons of awesome animations including

01:50 - you're going to need some targets if so

01:54 - perfect for one of those tutoral stages
01:56 - or maybe some of those target practice
01:58 - score attack modes this features lots of
02:00 - cardboard targets with everything
02:01 - personally I'd love to pick this one up
02:03 - and try making some kind of VR shooter
02:05 - demo and of course if you have shooting
02:06 - maybe you need some modular assault
02:08 - rifles if so look at this one this is a
02:10 - really impressive pack with an insane
02:11 - amount of customization you've got lots
02:13 - of stocks barrels Scopes grips lots of
02:16 - cartridges and tons more for example you
02:18 - can use this with my weapon attachment
02:20 - system to get a near infinite amount of
02:21 - weapon variation the models also include
02:24 - all kinds of parameters for modifying
02:25 - the amount of dirt or metal or plastic
02:27 - damage next here is a fun effect with
02:29 - some Edge detection this is a great
02:31 - post- pressing effect to make your game
02:32 - really stand out personally I'm always a
02:34 - fan of outlines I think it always looks
02:36 - great it's got lots of extra features
02:38 - like angle detection and depth fixes to
02:40 - make it look great in every scenario you
02:42 - can mask which objects have edges and
02:43 - which don't and even customize it
02:45 - alongside custom shaders then if you
02:46 - need some environment fire in VFX check
02:48 - out this one it features 25 particle
02:51 - prefabs there are some campfires some
02:53 - torches bowls candles or really just
02:55 - some fire areas including both with and
02:57 - without smoke the fire can be in
02:59 - different colors to symbolize different
03:00 - things next here's another pack from an
03:02 - as publisher that I really like this one
03:04 - features some wood industry this
03:06 - publisher has some really strange very
03:08 - Niche but also great looking asset packs
03:10 - this one would be great for some kind of
03:11 - logistics game or perhaps it could
03:13 - simply be an interesting level in a
03:15 - shooter or an RPG game it features lots
03:17 - of wood forests and some big heavy
03:19 - machinery then for another fun effect
03:21 - here is some color transition this one
03:23 - looks really unique it spawns thousands
03:25 - of scales and changes from one color to
03:27 - another the demo is using a car but this
03:29 - works on any 3D model it's using a
03:31 - comput Shader so it should be pretty
03:32 - performant or maybe you just need a huge
03:34 - environment for your post baly the game
03:36 - if so look at this one it's a realistic
03:38 - environment everything is broken down
03:40 - and rusted looks like some kind of
03:42 - desert I assume this is what the remote
03:43 - sit is in the middle of nowhere in the
03:45 - US look like personally I suck at level
03:47 - building so I really love these assets
03:48 - with some pre-built worlds filled with
03:50 - some really interesting props there's
03:51 - also a free link where you can try out a
03:53 - free demo to see the whole huge scene or
03:55 - if instead you prefer something more
03:56 - medieval check out this war camp it
03:59 - looks really cool if you add some fog
04:00 - and some color grading this could look
04:02 - straight like the intro from Gladiator
04:04 - naturally this would be perfect for some
04:06 - kind of RTS or maybe something like
04:07 - valheim or really just as a fun
04:09 - environment in an action game kind of
04:10 - like R son of Rome personally I really

04:16 - this visual effect it features some
04:17 - really realistic Ripples and waves it
04:19 - includes individual effects for all
04:21 - sides of the boat it says these are to
04:22 - the elements so it's primarily meant for
04:24 - a relatively calm water and looks great
04:26 - in this video or if you're making
04:27 - something more stylized here is a nice
04:29 - fantasy Village it looks very mystical
04:31 - very inviting this one is a huge pack
