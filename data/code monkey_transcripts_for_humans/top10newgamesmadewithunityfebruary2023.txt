00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity and launch in
00:05 - February 23. this one is an interesting
00:07 - list I was actually really busy at the
00:09 - time when I usually start researching
00:10 - and writing these videos since at that
00:12 - time I was just about to finish my free
00:13 - multiplayer course so I didn't have as
00:15 - much time to research tons of games but
00:17 - still I had no trouble on finding lots
00:19 - of asomons again that's great as a
00:21 - player lots of awesome stuff for you to
00:22 - play but It's Tricky as a developer lots
00:24 - of really tough competition the reason
00:26 - why I make these videos is to show you
00:27 - everything that the engine can do the
00:28 - element is really just your own skills
00:30 - and Imagination and the variety and the
00:32 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:33 - really puts out the test of these games
00:34 - that are uniquely impressive so the list
00:36 - is in no particular order except for the
00:37 - number one game that is my personal pick
00:39 - of the month by the way I'm currently
00:40 - working on my own steam game called
00:42 - turmoore Liberation it's a game with
00:43 - tons of systems open world survival
00:45 - crafting automation strategy check out
00:47 - the steam page edit to your wishlist and
00:49 - phone for the Devils by the way right
00:50 - now there's a Humble Bundle with a huge
00:52 - 97 off discount on Senti assets there
00:55 - are so many game ideas you could build
00:57 - with all of these maybe you could build
00:58 - a World War II shooter or a a plane
01:00 - simulator with warpack maybe even Lord
01:02 - of the Rings inspired RTS with this one
01:04 - then perhaps use the gang Warfare pack
01:06 - to make some kind of tycoon game maybe
01:08 - make your own life for that with the
01:09 - boss zombies you could build something
01:11 - like fallout shelter with the apocalypse
01:13 - Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle
01:15 - Royale with a better round pack or
01:17 - perhaps a songs like with the dungeon
01:19 - pack or really just prototype anything
01:21 - with a very useful prototype pack
01:23 - personally I'm a huge fan of their low
01:24 - poly song and if you also like it and
01:26 - you want tons of assets with a huge
01:28 - variety for a super deep discount then
01:30 - check it out to the link in the
01:31 - description alright so starting off at
01:33 - number 10 with a huge hit it sense of
01:35 - the force this one is the sequel to the
01:37 - very popular The Forest game it's
01:39 - survival horror with some Base building
01:40 - crafting and exploration elements you
01:42 - start off by gathering some resources
01:44 - and build a shelter for you and your
01:45 - friends but you're not alone in this
01:47 - Forest so you better be prepared to
01:49 - fight for your life there are lots of
01:50 - very creepy creatures and some gorgeous
01:52 - but scary looking environments exploring
01:54 - large open worm with changing seasons
01:56 - which also affect how the worm behaves
01:58 - survive alone or with friends in some
01:59 - nice Co-op survival it just came out and
02:02 - already has 70 000 very positive reviews
02:04 - even though it's only normally access
02:06 - definitely a huge hit they've already
02:07 - sold millions of copies then from that
02:09 - let's look at something a lot more calm
02:11 - and relaxing here is my dream setup it's
02:13 - pretty much exactly what it says it's a
02:15 - simple calming game where you just build
02:16 - your dreams out of play some Furnitures
02:18 - and customize it you can paint your
02:20 - walls choose your computer the shape of
02:22 - the room and listen to some music it's
02:23 - interesting how this has sort of become
02:25 - a genre there are now a bunch of games
02:26 - like this one like for example unpacking
02:28 - or townscaper where the goal is really
02:30 - just calm relaxation with 400 very
02:32 - positive reviews it looks like this is a
02:34 - final genre next here we have a huge
02:36 - game it's an MMORPG built with unity
02:38 - it's called Glory evictus the way they
02:40 - describe the game is Mountain blade
02:42 - means PlanetSide 2. I must say that
02:44 - combination definitely intrigues me
02:45 - those are two excellent games you become
02:47 - part of this world and take on various
02:49 - roles so you can become a soldier
02:50 - assassin Huntsman blacksmith and more
02:52 - features non-target combat so it's very
02:54 - freeform just like with PlanetSide 2 you
02:57 - have a huge world where you can control
02:58 - certain territories and includes a
03:00 - player driven economy where players
03:02 - craft all kinds of items and sell them
03:03 - in their own stores also has some
03:05 - classless progression every skill I use
03:07 - you improve on that skill so in all the
03:09 - concept seems really interesting
03:10 - although it does have mixed recent
03:12 - reviews so apparently the 1.0 release
03:14 - left some people wanting more if you
03:15 - like gorgeous 3D art and some mystery
03:17 - then definitely check out the panel
03:19 - Beyond it's a resource management
03:20 - Survival Story game lead your crew on
03:23 - your ship explore this world and gather
03:24 - enough resources for survival keep your
03:26 - crew safe and fed if you don't you might
03:28 - get a mutiny as they show their loyalty
03:30 - to a different Captain what's the
03:32 - decisions to make and then an engaging
03:33 - story to experience it has over 500 very
03:35 - positive reviews so if you like this
03:37 - type of game definitely give it a look
03:38 - then for some VR here is the Light
03:40 - Brigade it's a roguelike VR shooter
03:42 - combining both realistic Gunplay as well
03:44 - as some light magic the guns are very
03:46 - physical it's always satisfying to
03:48 - handle a bolt action rifle very Punchy
03:50 - very satisfying sound effects and of
03:51 - course beyond the guns you also have
03:53 - some magic at your disposal cast all
03:55 - kinds of spells for both offense and
03:56 - defense you can gather some Loot and
03:58 - find some new abilities it it's a
04:00 - roguelike so you also have lots of
04:02 - upgrades at your disposal to make every
04:03 - run better this combination of realistic
04:05 - Gunplay and some nice magic really looks
04:07 - quite interesting it has 250 very
04:10 - positive reviews which for VR game that
04:12 - is an excellent result then here we have
04:13 - some magical strategy with spell Force
04:15 - conquest of EO looks like a very well
04:18 - made game great visions and UI quite a
04:20 - lot of complexity tons of Interlocking
04:22 - Systems plenty of unique characters in a
04:23 - huge world this one isn't really a genre
04:25 - that I have much experience with so I
04:27 - can't really tell what is the quarter
04:28 - differentiating hook for this one it
04:30 - just seems like a very well built game
04:32 - it has 900 very positive reviews so
04:34 - apparently fans of this genre do really
04:36 - like it next here we have a deck
04:37 - building game with something that I
04:39 - haven't seen before it's Aces and
04:40 - Adventures nowadays there are tons and
04:42 - tons of deck building games on all kinds
04:44 - of genres with all kinds of rules this
04:46 - one seems unique in that it uses poker
04:48 - rolls so it combines unique character
04:49 - and Attack cards alongside regular cards
04:52 - if you have a simple pair you can do
04:53 - some small damage if you have four of a
04:55 - kind you can deal massive damage you can
04:57 - combine the flush with an ability to do
04:58 - some really interesting actions so in
05:00 - all a very interesting concept it also
05:02 - has some excellent voice acting
05:03 - alongside handcrafted campaigns and a
05:06 - procedural mode with 600 very positive
05:08 - reviews it seems to people really like
05:09 - this mix so if you're a fan of card
05:11 - games and this looks like an interesting
05:12 - new take next here we have another one
05:14 - that also has an interesting mix of
05:15 - genres this one is corpse keeper it
05:18 - describes itself as a very challenging
05:19 - action strategy roguelike basically you
05:21 - control a necromancer but you cannot
05:23 - fight directly so you bring some corpses
05:25 - back from there to fight for you in
05:27 - terms of games it's kind of like a
05:29 - fighting game you encounter an enemy
05:30 - summon your fighter and engage in a duel
05:32 - each corpse also has tons of stats that
05:34 - you can level up with some very unique
05:36 - movesets so it's an interesting mix of
05:38 - strategy and fighting game then here at
05:40 - number two is Plan B terraform this one
05:42 - was almost my personal pick of the month
05:44 - it looks really awesome these are on
05:46 - this Baron Rock Wasteland and it's up to
05:48 - you to terraform it into a lush
05:50 - habitable world begin by gathering some
05:52 - resources to feed your first settlers
05:54 - then more colonists will join which
05:55 - means you need to grow with them use
05:57 - trains and trucks to transport them
05:59 - around and get to work on making this
06:01 - planet livable features a deep
06:02 - simulation of atmosphere temperature
06:04 - water in the forest it is out now in
06:06 - Early Access which is perfect for this
06:08 - type of game the devs seem very active
06:10 - with 1 000 very positive reviews this
06:12 - looks like an excellent new entry in the
06:13 - genre and at number one for my personal
06:15 - pick the month here is Phantom Brigade
06:17 - when I first heard about the concept for
06:19 - this game I was immediately hooked it
06:21 - has a very inventive timeline mechanic
06:23 - where you can scroll through the
06:24 - timeline and see what will happen in the
06:26 - next few seconds then you can use that
06:27 - to decide how to move your mechs it's a
06:29 - really cool idea making for some really
06:31 - interesting strategy gameplay it is
06:33 - simultaneously both turn based and real
06:35 - time visually it also looks really great
06:36 - I love the art sound some gorgeous giant
06:39 - Max with a really nice sense of scale
06:40 - you have tons of weapons and parts to
06:43 - equip your Mech alongside some very
06:44 - satisfying destruction this one has

I must say that combination definitely intrigues me those are two excellent games you become part of this world and take on various roles so you can become a soldier assassin Huntsman blacksmith and more features nontarget combat so it's very freeform just like with PlanetSide 2 you have a huge world where you can control certain territories and includes a player driven economy where players craft all kinds of items and sell them in their own stores also has some classless progression every skill I use you improve on that skill so in all the concept seems really interesting although it does have mixed recent reviews so apparently the 1.0 release left some people wanting more if you like gorgeous 3D art and some mystery then definitely check out the panel Beyond it's a resource
