00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so last week I made a video analyzing
00:04 - the results for the Sim Festival I
00:06 - looked at the raw numbers for my game
00:08 - and I analyzed what they meant now in
00:10 - this video let me tell you some lessons
00:11 - that I learned some very practical
00:12 - lessons as well as my advice for when
00:14 - you participate in your own scene
00:16 - Festival so you can find success okay so
00:18 - starting with the most obvious actional
00:20 - advice which is simply make sure you
00:22 - participate in a steam Festival if
00:24 - you're an indie Dev and you want to find
00:25 - success nowadays then a Sim Festival is
00:27 - definitely a must it's an excellent
00:29 - opportunity to have players play your
00:31 - game get a lot of feedback and hopefully
00:33 - get tons of wishlists a good demo can
00:35 - get you tens of thousands of wishlists
00:37 - which can massively increase your odds
00:38 - of finding success you can find the
00:40 - various dates for the various upcoming
00:42 - Sim festivals the next one is going to
00:44 - be in October you can only participate
00:46 - in a single Sim festival with your game
00:48 - so make sure you choose the one right
00:49 - before release and the reason why you
00:52 - should choose the one right before
00:53 - release listening to my second piece of
00:55 - advice which is you should make sure
00:57 - your game demo is as published as can be
00:59 - ideally it should be very close to the
01:01 - final game with quite a lot of Polish
01:03 - everything must be ready now in my case
01:05 - I did not follow this advice which
01:07 - actually ended up hurting the demo quite
01:08 - a bit and the reason why I didn't follow
01:09 - it wasn't out of ignorance or anything
01:11 - it was simply because this game is on an
01:13 - intentionally short death cycle so I
01:15 - really had to rush to get any demo
01:17 - running I couldn't really publish
01:18 - something properly but for your games
01:20 - for your serious projects my advice is
01:22 - definitely make sure you make a nice
01:24 - polish demo even if the full game isn't
01:26 - yet fully polished itself definitely
01:28 - make sure the demo is as polished as can
01:30 - be so think of it as kind of like a
01:31 - super polished vertical slice it is much
01:33 - much better to have a small but highly
01:36 - polished like 30 minute gameplay demo it
01:38 - is much better to do that than have like
01:40 - 10 hours of something that is just
01:42 - meddling the next advice is also related
01:44 - to having a great demo which is make
01:45 - sure you also have a great tutorial this
01:47 - is another thing that my game demo
01:49 - lacked and once again for the same
01:50 - reason like of time demos are super
01:52 - short and super quick so your players
01:54 - need to be able to learn how to play the
01:56 - game super fast with literally thousands
01:58 - of free demos available during any of
02:00 - these festivals your game players will
02:02 - not stick around if anything is even
02:03 - slightly annoying so a great guy the
02:05 - demo that slowly teaches your players
02:07 - how to play your game that is of the
02:09 - utmost importance one very important
02:10 - snack to keep track of this is
02:12 - essentially play time now on Chris
02:13 - zukowski's website how to Market your
02:15 - game there's a really nice Benchmark
02:17 - page in there there are tons of data
02:19 - including a really nice Benchmark for
02:20 - demos basically for bronze You've Got 7
02:23 - minutes for silver you've got 18 gold is
02:26 - 38 minutes and diamond is 65 minutes now
02:28 - also remember this is median this is not
02:30 - average that is a huge important
02:32 - distinction you can see just how
02:33 - insanely good your demo has to be in
02:35 - order to keep the players engaged in a
02:37 - free demo for 65 minutes that is
02:39 - extremely difficult now in my case
02:41 - because my game demo did not have any
02:43 - sort of tutorial when the demo first
02:45 - came out the initial average was
02:47 - actually pretty bad it was a pretty bad
02:49 - nine minutes however after implementing
02:50 - a proper tutorial and tons of changes
02:52 - the average did shot up to about 13
02:54 - minutes and that's just the total median
02:57 - for the entire play duration of all of
02:58 - the players if I look individually at
03:01 - each day I can see a really nice upward
03:02 - trend line so this really shows you the
03:04 - importance of having a good demo to
03:06 - easily teach your players and easily
03:07 - guide them to know how to play your game
03:09 - do make sure your demo has a really nice
03:11 - smooth difficulty curve so your players
03:13 - keep enjoying the game again remember
03:14 - during these festivals there are only
03:16 - thousands of games available so if your
03:18 - game has just one slightly thing that is
03:20 - slightly annoying or not very well
03:21 - taught to the players they won't very
03:23 - easily just quit and go on to the next
03:25 - game another piece of advice is make
03:26 - sure to implement analytics this is
03:28 - another one that I didn't quite have at
03:30 - lunch although I did manage to implement
03:31 - it by about the 10th update analytics is
03:33 - excellent for helping you identify how
03:35 - players are actually playing your game
03:37 - remember that most players won't
03:39 - actually take the time to leave some
03:40 - written feedback so in order to figure
03:42 - out how the silent majority is actually
03:44 - play your game then having some
03:45 - analytics really helps wouldn't very
03:47 - obvious use case is ADD analytics to
03:49 - your tutorial make sure you want tons of
03:51 - events at every single stage of the
03:52 - tutorial in my example I noticed there
03:54 - was a big drop off in the stage for
03:56 - creating a free crate container now I
03:59 - didn't add tons and and tons of
04:00 - analytics events so I need to do some
04:02 - kind of guesswork in order to figure out
04:03 - why this drop-off happened based on this
04:06 - data in my case I just added lots more
04:08 - flashing arrows in order to make that
04:09 - stage in the tutorial make it a little
04:11 - bit more straightforward and with that I
04:13 - did manage to increase the complete
04:15 - percentage on that series return from 91
04:17 - to 94 so that's a pretty nice
04:19 - Improvement ideally you want as many
04:21 - players as possible to go through your
04:23 - entire tutorial and complete your phone
04:24 - demo and hopefully at the end which one
04:26 - is your game although honestly I don't
04:28 - know what are some stats for that I
04:29 - don't know what is a good percentage
04:30 - between players and wishlist added but
04:32 - obviously you should aim for as many as
04:34 - possible so in order to keep track of
04:36 - how the sound majority is actually
04:37 - playing your game make sure you
04:39 - implement analytics related to that
04:40 - another advice is make sure you
04:42 - implement Cloud Diagnostics now this is
04:44 - one that I did Implement right before
04:45 - the demo in live this is a Unity tool
04:47 - that helps you very easily see all kinds
04:49 - of crashes and bugs that happen in your
04:51 - game and it's all automated which again
04:53 - helps you update the game in order to
04:54 - fix any bugs even without getting direct
04:56 - bugger reports directly from your
04:58 - players you can see what went Kronk and
05:00 - either try to figure out the root cause
05:02 - and try to fix it or maybe just add some
05:04 - safeguards add some ifs in order to make
05:06 - sure that if whatever issue happens
05:08 - again it does not break the entire game
05:09 - another advice on another useful tool is
05:11 - add some kind of feedback form directly
05:13 - inside your game like I said very few
05:15 - people will actually take the time to
05:17 - write some feedback that is why it is so
05:18 - valuable when those people take the time
05:20 - to do so most people really just quit
05:22 - the game soundly that's why I'm always
05:24 - so thankful for any kind of feedback
05:25 - that I get it is extremely useful and
05:28 - because this because of how valuable
05:29 - feedback is you should make it as easy
05:31 - as possible for players to give you
05:32 - their feedback this is way to do that is
05:34 - to have some kind of feedback window
05:35 - directly inside the game that way
05:37 - players don't have to go into YouTube
05:39 - comments or scene forms in order to give
05:40 - their feedback they can just type in
05:42 - directly from the game and you receive
05:43 - that feedback now this is another thing
05:45 - that suddenly I didn't quite have the
05:46 - time to implement but I do know there
05:48 - are a bunch of very useful assets on the
05:50 - store that do exactly this so you can
05:51 - experiment with one of those or of
05:53 - course you can always build yourself
05:54 - some of those assets are pretty Advanced
05:56 - and they even let you include a
05:57 - screenshot which can make it super easy
05:59 - for debugging then some more advice
06:01 - based on wishlist there is one theory
06:03 - that some part of your visibility during
06:05 - the Sim Festival is actually going to be
06:07 - based on your performance before the
06:08 - theme Festival I don't think this theory
06:10 - has been confirmed but it does make some
06:12 - sense basically games that are already
06:14 - showing to have some interest before the
06:16 - festival won't be shown much more during
06:18 - the festival based on this what you
06:19 - should do is really push the game right
06:21 - before the festival so in the one to two
06:23 - weeks leading up to it now in my case I
06:25 - did end up trying that I did do a bunch
06:27 - of shorts and a bunch of devlogs in the
06:29 - week right before the festival so in the
06:31 - week right before I did manage to gather
06:32 - 150 wishlists although I have to say
06:35 - this was really stressful it was really
06:37 - difficult to be able to make these
06:39 - videos these shorts at the same time as
06:40 - I was desperately trying to finish the
06:42 - game demo on time and on this one like I
06:44 - said this is just an unconfirmed Theory
06:45 - so there's no way of knowing if this
06:47 - matters at all or not maybe I did get
06:49 - some extra visibility during the
06:51 - festival because I did those videos or
06:53 - maybe didn't end up doing anything but
06:54 - still if you can do it if you have a
06:56 - nice process for promoting your game a
06:58 - little bit more then maybe try doing
06:59 - that right before the Festival begins
07:01 - another piece of advice is make sure you
07:03 - do some live streams during the festival
07:04 - theme lets you create two Live Events
07:07 - where you can go alive during the
07:08 - festival and they will be promoted on
07:10 - the festival homepage this can cause a
07:12 - nice little extra bump I did that myself
07:14 - although in my case instead of actually
07:16 - playing the game I spent the live stream
07:18 - building the game which honestly I think
07:19 - is probably a better thing since all the
07:21 - other developers will likely be playing
07:23 - their game so making it a development
07:25 - live stream might make it a bit more
07:26 - unique a bit more standout personally I
07:28 - use restream in order to stream directly
07:30 - to both YouTube and on scene for some
07:33 - stats on how those seem live streams
07:34 - went I end up making two of them for the
07:37 - first one it got 6000 views 300
07:40 - concurrent viewers and 17 average
07:41 - seconds viewed and for the second one
07:43 - which I published literally just one
07:45 - hour before the theme Festival end which
07:47 - was a bit too late but still on the
07:48 - second one it still got 5K views 600
07:51 - viewers and 3 minutes and 17 seconds
07:52 - average view duration honestly these
07:54 - numbers are actually pretty good these
07:56 - match what I get on YouTube and on
07:58 - YouTube it took me five years to to
07:59 - build up this audience so on Steam you
08:01 - can get similar numbers without having
08:03 - to put in all that much work so that
08:04 - does seem to be pretty good however at
08:06 - the same time I'm not sure if that
08:08 - translated into any wish list at all
08:09 - looking at the stats I'm really not
08:11 - seeing any individual bumps but still
08:13 - it's a nice bonus it's one of the main
08:15 - features for the festival so do make
08:16 - sure you do some live streams when you
08:18 - do participate so all of those those are
08:20 - my apiece advice for you when you
08:22 - participate in your own Sim Festival
08:23 - like I said participating in a steam
08:25 - Festival nowadays is definitely a must
08:26 - it can literally make or break your game
08:28 - a good demo can get you tens of
08:30 - thousands of wishlists which can
08:31 - massively improve your chance of success
08:33 - when the game finally comes out
08:34 - hopefully if you follow all these Subs
08:36 - you won't greatly increase your chance
08:37 - of finding success in the final release
08:39 - so I generally hope this advice helps
08:41 - you and I wish you the best of luck with
08:42 - your games alright so if you found this
08:44 - useful you can go ahead and help me by
08:46 - adding dinky Gardens to your wish list
08:47 - thank you for watching and I'll see you
08:49 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so last week I made a video analyzing the results for the Sim Festival I looked at the raw numbers for my game and I analyzed what they meant now in this video let me tell you some lessons that I learned some very practical lessons as well as my advice for when you participate in your own scene Festival so you can find success okay so starting with the most obvious actional advice which is simply make sure you participate in a steam Festival if you're an indie Dev and you want to find success nowadays then a Sim Festival is definitely a must it's an excellent opportunity to have players play your game get a lot of feedback and hopefully get tons of wishlists a good demo can get you tens of thousands of wishlists which can massively increase your odds of finding success you can find the various dates for the various upcoming Sim festivals the next one is going to be in October you can only participate in a single Sim festival with your game so make sure you choose the one right before release and the reason why you should choose the one right before release listening to my second piece of advice which is you should make sure your game demo is as published as can be ideally it should be very close to the final game with quite a lot of Polish everything must be ready now in my case I did not follow this advice which actually ended up

you also have a great tutorial this is another thing that my game demo lacked and once again for the same reason like of time demos are super short and super quick so your players need to be able to
