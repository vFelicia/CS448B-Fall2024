00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to review all
00:03 - the videos published in October 2018
00:04 - let's begin
00:08 - so October had several videos covering
00:11 - systems in various triple-a games these
00:13 - are great to recreate and learned
00:14 - various components that make a system
00:16 - work and how each of them combines into
00:18 - a final effect the most complex was the
00:20 - data effect from reddit Redemption -
00:22 - it's a really cool effect and it was
00:24 - great when converted into a 2-d game the
00:27 - effect in the video is composed of
00:28 - several things first the post-processing
00:30 - to change the color of the whole scene
00:32 - then the slow-motion effect and the
00:34 - ability to place tags and have tags on
00:36 - enemies follow that enemy the video goes
00:38 - in-depth into how each thing works and
00:40 - will help you analyze effects in games
00:42 - by looking at their individual
00:44 - components
00:45 - there were several videos from
00:47 - Assassin's Creed Odyssey first we had
00:49 - the mercenary bar which represents your
00:51 - bounty in the game if it reaches a
00:53 - certain threshold mercenary won't come
00:55 - after you
00:56 - making the bar require some interesting
00:58 - logic to get the bar and the icon
01:00 - between each bar working then we have
01:02 - the adrenaline system it is used for
01:04 - various abilities in the game and we use
01:06 - it the same way in the video on the
01:08 - spartan kick so essentially you gain
01:10 - adrenaline per enemy you attack per kill
01:12 - and for each successful dodge it's a
01:14 - great video to learn how to organize a
01:15 - simple system and identify unique
01:17 - actions unlike a successful dodge with
01:20 - the adrenaline system working we then
01:21 - recreated the Spartan kick it's a very
01:24 - powerful kick that since enemies flying
01:25 - away implementing it requires capturing
01:28 - an action on the player side but also
01:29 - dealing with the behavior for flying
01:31 - away when kicked on the enemy side and
01:33 - finally we create the adrenaline bar so
01:35 - we can see the bar filling up whenever
01:36 - we gain adrenaline this is similar to
01:38 - the mercenary bar but since we don't
01:40 - have any icons at the end we can make it
01:42 - more dynamic the bar dynamically
01:44 - occupies whatever space we define for
01:46 - the background and splits itself up into
01:48 - as many segments as we want so by using
01:50 - this code in a game it would be trivial
01:52 - to have an upgrade to increase the
01:53 - number of bars then there were three
01:56 - videos continuing our recreation of
01:58 - spider-man in unity 2d first we made the
02:00 - enemies move until then they were
02:02 - completely static and only served as a
02:03 - punching bag so we have the code for
02:05 - them to chase the player then we got to
02:08 - work on creating the first spider-man
02:09 - specific ability the web zip since the
02:12 - perspective isn't top-down we couldn't
02:13 - add web swinging so web surfing is very
02:16 - cool turns it we point the mouse into a
02:18 - specific location and hit space then our
02:20 - spider man fires his webs from his hands
02:21 - in
02:22 - to the target when do I have reaches the
02:23 - target he pulls himself towards it's a
02:25 - great feeling ability with some
02:27 - interesting code for dealing with the
02:28 - process of waiting then pulling him
02:30 - towards the target and finally a slide
02:32 - at the end so with that we then got to
02:34 - work on another Spiderman ability
02:35 - shooting web projectiles this video
02:38 - essentially teaches you how to make a
02:39 - simple projectile it spawns a web
02:41 - project eye only moves it towards the
02:42 - target position while checking for
02:44 - collisions along the way we have the
02:46 - nice effect when the web reaches its
02:48 - maximum distance and the whole effect
02:49 - looks great for a beginner content there
02:52 - was a video on how to make the simplest
02:53 - character movement it's a very easy to
02:55 - follow video starting from scratch
02:57 - capturing keyboard input and moving the
02:59 - transform whilst playing animations then
03:02 - we took that base and added collision
03:03 - detection with it some ray cast before
03:05 - we moved into position in order to note
03:07 - four walls again very simple but very
03:09 - useful if you are a complete beginner
03:11 - also this month
03:13 - Baracus made a great video challenging
03:14 - himself to make a game in just 10
03:16 - minutes then at the end he issued the
03:18 - challenge to whoever won to participate
03:20 - I joined in using a somewhat different
03:22 - approach rather than starting completely
03:24 - from scratch I used the video to
03:25 - highlight the power of writing clean
03:27 - reusable code so by using many systems
03:30 - and assets that I've created in the past
03:31 - I managed to create a pretty complex
03:33 - scene in just 10 minutes
03:34 - the final scene is essentially a
03:36 - bare-bones RTS which is a tough janitor
03:39 - to create we have two functions that we
03:41 - can spawn and they attack each other was
03:43 - having a health system and a visual bar
03:45 - and a lot of special effects then using
03:47 - that scene as a base in the next video
03:49 - we expanded upon it by starting to make
03:51 - it more like a proper RTS so we had
03:53 - gathers very much like we did in the
03:55 - gatherer AI series then we use those
03:57 - resources to spawn more gatherers and
03:59 - warriors on with nice RTS you I
04:01 - showcasing the constant progress of
04:03 - building each unit I intend to continue
04:04 - doing videos on this and so when we get
04:06 - to something similar like Age of Empires
04:08 - there was a quick video summarizing the
04:10 - whole simple AI resource gatherer series
04:12 - in just three minutes I go over all the
04:15 - videos in series and how each of them
04:16 - builds up to the final scene I think
04:18 - making a summary when I finish a series
04:19 - is a great way to set things up for the
04:21 - future in case you're interested in an
04:23 - ongoing series but getting lost waiting
04:25 - for the videos you can check out the
04:26 - summary when it comes out and then watch
04:28 - the whole playlist and also two videos
04:30 - continuing they create a graph series
04:32 - this series is very much in depth so if
04:34 - looking to learn how a graph is created
04:36 - it will help you immensely first the
04:38 - tooltip video which is great for
04:39 - learning even if you aren't interested
04:40 - in making a graph I'm planning on making
04:43 - a separate video on the tooltip since
04:44 - it's such a useful component and not
04:46 - many people might see it if it's part of
04:48 - a long series then in order to prepare a
04:50 - graph to support real-time updating we
04:52 - have to create the bar chart visual
04:54 - object it's not a great video that
04:55 - teaches you how to organize your code by
04:57 - using interfaces and separate classes so
05:00 - that was it for the month of October
05:02 - 2018 I hope you found the video is
05:04 - helpful and learn something along the
05:05 - way
05:06 - if you have questions regarding any of
05:08 - the videos feel free to post them in the
05:09 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
05:11 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
05:13 - see you next time
