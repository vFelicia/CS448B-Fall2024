00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with young teen launch in
00:05 - June 23. this was quite an interesting
00:06 - month I thought perhaps there would be a
00:08 - few releases because the steam Festival
00:10 - but not really still tons of games and
00:12 - still very difficult to pick just 10.
00:13 - the reason why I make these videos is to
00:15 - show you everything the engine can do
00:16 - the limit is really just your own skills
00:18 - and Imagination and the variety and the
00:20 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:21 - really puts out to the test of these
00:22 - games are uniquely impressive so don't
00:24 - listen to no particular order except for
00:25 - the number one game that is my personal
00:27 - pick them also speaking of the steam
00:29 - Festival my own game dinky Guardians was
00:30 - part of it with a free demo which is
00:32 - still available right now it's a fun
00:34 - Solo or Co-op game with some automation
00:36 - building and defense where you must keep
00:38 - the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from
00:40 - harm go try out a demo edit your
00:42 - wishlist and phone for devops alright so
00:43 - starting off at number 10 with a fun
00:45 - unique game called Driftwood this one is
00:47 - all about downhill longboarding and very
00:49 - importantly you play as a sloth so
00:51 - definitely a very nice genre but great
00:53 - presentation the concept of a sloth
00:55 - going downhill at high speeds is
00:56 - definitely quite interesting personally
00:58 - I love the original style very nice and
00:59 - appealing it looks like a more slightly
01:02 - casual racing game which personally I
01:03 - quite like you've got some drift
01:05 - controls to go down on turns in a nice
01:07 - satisfying way there's a trick system so
01:09 - you can do 360s and keep on going you
01:11 - can travel to new places and experience
01:13 - some interesting tracks all with a nice
01:15 - relaxing soundtrack you can play either
01:16 - solo for a nice casual time or if you
01:19 - prefer there is also a competitive mode
01:20 - where every second counts it is out now
01:22 - in Early Access with 200 very positive
01:24 - reviews then for some building and
01:26 - physics here is Mars personal Logistics
01:28 - it's a very physically accurate
01:30 - simulator where you build some machines
01:32 - from realistic pieces and set them up to
01:34 - complete all kinds of tasks like name
01:36 - implies you're on Mars so you start off
01:38 - with some basic machines just some
01:40 - wheels and Grabber easy to pick up a
01:42 - simple object and move it around then
01:43 - you complete some missions and unlock
01:45 - new parts to play with the level of
01:47 - customization is truly insane there are
01:49 - tons of parts that can be combined in an
01:51 - infinite way to build any machine you
01:52 - can think of the missions involve
01:54 - carrying all sorts of strangely shaped
01:56 - objects and you need to build your
01:57 - machine in such a way that it can
01:59 - actually pick up those objects also has
02:01 - a nice visual Style with some thick
02:03 - outlines several games have done this
02:04 - already and I think it always looks good
02:06 - if you like some realistic physics
02:08 - Simulator games and this looks like a
02:09 - great new one it is out now in Early
02:11 - Access with 200 very positive reviews
02:13 - next here's one that is definitely not
02:15 - for me but it does look great it's
02:17 - called killer frequency personally I am
02:19 - not a fan of horror games I get scared
02:21 - way too easily so I don't normally look
02:23 - at them for these lists but this one has
02:25 - so many insanely positive reviews that I
02:27 - just have to give it a look and it
02:28 - actually doesn't seem to have too many
02:30 - jump squares so perhaps I could even
02:31 - handle this one the premise is you're a
02:34 - late night radio talk show host where
02:36 - the colors are being installed by a
02:38 - mysterious color it's essentially a
02:39 - first person puzzle game through your
02:41 - choices you can decide who lives and who
02:43 - dies and either don't listen to their
02:45 - size of relief or their screams of
02:47 - horror explore your surroundings gather
02:49 - some Clues and try to help each of your
02:51 - colors survive the night the voice
02:52 - acting is absolutely excellent and
02:54 - Visually the game also looks gorgeous
02:56 - this is something that a lot of horror
02:57 - games do very well all the SSRS super
03:00 - high quality tons of great effects it is
03:02 - out now with 500 overwhelmingly positive
03:04 - reviews so that is 95 positive so if
03:07 - this intrigues you definitely give it a
03:08 - look next if you're into Colony building
03:10 - with tons of objects and tons of
03:12 - automation here is novolence you'll land
03:14 - on an alien planet and you have your
03:16 - trusty rayton weapon thingy that can
03:18 - help you gather resources and construct
03:20 - buildings and machines start off by
03:22 - manually harvesting some resources then
03:24 - quickly boost your productivity with
03:25 - some automated Bots tell those Bots to
03:27 - grab resources from one place and drop
03:29 - them somewhere the map is really
03:31 - interesting in that it is based on tiles
03:33 - you explore the world and unlock more
03:35 - and more tiles which are very unique
03:36 - each style has different objects and
03:38 - different resources you can also engage
03:40 - in combat and uncover Mysteries you
03:42 - expand and get to a point where you can
03:44 - even build a spaceship and fly towards
03:46 - the Stars to mine some asteroids and
03:47 - bring them back to land this game looks
03:49 - really massive while also looking quite
03:51 - inviting and the mechanic of unlocking
03:53 - different tiles in the world makes it
03:54 - more quite interesting it is out now and
03:56 - already has 500 very positive reviews
03:58 - next here is one with a very unique
04:00 - visual mechanic it's called pallav it's
04:02 - a building game where you start on a
04:04 - small plot of land and slowly build
04:06 - vertically you build houses for your
04:08 - people then those people also have needs
04:10 - they need some power food water and all
04:12 - kinds of things keep building upwards
04:14 - and keep your people happy unlock new
04:16 - buildings and resources complete some
04:18 - islands and discover new ones or hop
04:20 - onto sandbox mode and build without any
04:22 - limitations visually it looks really
04:24 - great a very nice chill style so
04:26 - something kind of like landscaper but
04:28 - only in a really tiny confined space it
04:30 - looks like a nice mix between a very
04:32 - cozy and inviting game but also one
04:34 - where you must pay attention and fulfill
04:36 - the needs of your people and bonus
04:38 - points there's also a nice friendly
04:39 - whale you can pet it is out now in Early
04:41 - Access and has over 200 very positive
04:44 - reviews then every month there's tons of
04:46 - new vampire survival likes here's an
04:48 - interesting one called Army of Ruin
04:50 - features the gameplay that you expect
04:51 - with these kinds of games so tons and
04:53 - tons of units and lots of ways to get
04:55 - rid of them these games are also about
04:57 - polish and based on trailer this one
04:59 - will looks really satisfying to play
05:01 - it's a great case study to see how you
05:03 - can make just something like unlocking a
05:05 - chest feeling really satisfying features
05:07 - tons of unique abilities with some very
05:09 - unique visuals the game looks really
05:10 - nice and colorful which is also nice and
05:12 - different from all of the other vampire
05:14 - survival likes you can upgrade your
05:15 - weapons unlock better more powerful
05:17 - weapons take out thousands of enemies
05:19 - and do it all over again it is out now
05:21 - and already has over a thousand very
05:23 - positive reviews for some VR here is an
05:25 - awesome one called battle Talent it's a
05:28 - super fast-paced physics-based sword
05:30 - fighting world-like name this is one of
05:32 - those where I really love how it looks
05:33 - the gameplay looks excellent it's a nice
05:36 - mix of swords and pistols so you can
05:38 - slash your enemies throw them in the air
05:39 - and then shoot them so kind of like a
05:41 - first person Devil May Cry or the
05:43 - weapons also remind me of the movie
05:44 - equilibrium really awesome movie one of
05:46 - my favorites just based on the awesome
05:48 - style Beyond swords and pistols you also
05:50 - have some magic so you can throw some
05:51 - Fireballs or some ice spells and a bunch
05:53 - more all of the objects they are all
05:55 - physically based which makes it look
05:57 - really satisfying you can fight over 80
05:59 - enemy with a hundred weapons and 60
06:01 - perks on top of all that it even has
06:03 - already over a thousand player created
06:05 - mods now the question with melee and VR
06:08 - is just how good does it feel and this
06:10 - one seems so fast paced with some
06:11 - excellent sound effects that it does
06:13 - look like pairing and striking feels
06:15 - very satisfying it looks really intense
06:16 - which some people can't handle
06:18 - thankfully this one also has a free demo
06:20 - so if you want to try it out and see if
06:22 - you can handle this much movement give
06:23 - it a try it is out now with almost 200
06:25 - very positive views which is a great
06:27 - amount for a VR game then here is one
06:29 - that is targeted for a very specific
06:31 - audience which you can tell by the name
06:33 - alone it is called slayer's X terminal
06:36 - aftermath Vengeance of the Slayer with a
06:38 - name like that and visuals you can
06:40 - really tell that it's going for a really
06:41 - over the top retro style very old school
06:43 - visuals intentionally low quality assets
06:46 - and Sprites with some very inventive
06:47 - weapons and enemies the music is awesome
06:49 - I mostly don't pay attention to music
06:51 - but I really enjoyed listening to the
06:52 - trailer so if the final game has music
06:54 - just like that then that's awesome
06:55 - basically if you like retro Shooters if
06:58 - you enjoy what you're seeing right now
07:00 - then give it a shot it is out now and
07:01 - already has overwhelmingly positive
07:03 - reviews with over 500 of them at 98
07:06 - positive which is insane up next here is
07:09 - a very strange spin-off it's called
07:11 - Kingdom 80s this one is part of the
07:13 - Kingdom series those medieval sites
07:15 - rolling strategy games this one is all
07:17 - about being set in the 80s now that's a
07:19 - very strange concept for a spin-off but
07:21 - honestly I do think it looks great it
07:22 - features similar side swirling gameplay
07:24 - so you grab your bike going left or
07:27 - right pick up some coins you build up
07:28 - your town with some defenses and stay
07:30 - safe from these mysterious monsters it
07:32 - is more story focused so you can meet
07:34 - some unique characters and befriend them
07:36 - you can ride together and give them
07:37 - roles as either Builders or soldiers go
07:40 - out on adventures expand your kingdom
07:41 - fortify it with walls and defensive
07:43 - turrets and when the Night Comes then
07:45 - you can defend them during the day you
07:46 - can explore the town you can visit the
07:48 - shops or find some items on the skate
07:50 - park all in all it's definitely a
07:51 - strange concept for a spin-off but it
07:53 - doesn't look quite interesting it has
07:55 - mostly positive reviews with the main
07:56 - negative being the short duration but if
07:59 - you don't like the a 80 style and short
08:00 - story Focus games and give it a try and
08:03 - at number one for my personal pick the
08:04 - month here is a huge hit of this month
08:06 - battle bit remastered honestly it's not
08:08 - just a hit of this month but almost the
08:10 - biggest hit of the year it had Peak
08:12 - concurrent users of 86 000 this is an
08:14 - insane amount for any game let alone an
08:16 - indie game this likely means it already
08:18 - sold millions of copies the game itself
08:20 - is a massive online shooter with
08:22 - combined arms something like Battlefield
08:23 - meaning you've got some infantry
08:25 - helicopters tanks ships and a bunch more
08:27 - all fighting on huge worlds with 256
08:30 - players so really massive scale and it
08:32 - also features tons of very satisfying
08:34 - destruction so very much like
08:35 - Battlefield Bad Company 2 which
08:37 - personally I really love playing down
08:38 - the Gunplay is of course excellent for a
08:40 - game like this to be successful
08:41 - everything needs to be on point they
08:43 - also have a focus on high performance
08:45 - and high-tech rate servers clearly they
08:47 - focus very heavily on making the
08:48 - gameplay as perfect as possible features
08:50 - a classic class system with some Medics
08:53 - assault engineer Recon and support
08:54 - drones it's got 19 huge Dynamic maps and
08:57 - 45 weapons now this one is called
08:59 - remastered but I have no idea what the
09:00 - original was whatever it was clearly
09:02 - people wanted a bunch more it just
09:04 - recently came out and already has 25
09:07 - 000 very positive reviews even though
09:08 - it's only an early access truly one of
09:10 - the biggest hits not just this month but
09:12 - the entire year it's really awesome to
09:13 - see Indie devs find this much success
09:15 - from what I can find this team is mostly
09:17 - just three people working on this game
09:19 - for several years really impressive
09:20 - alright so that's 10 awesome new games
09:22 - made with Indian launch in June 23. I
09:24 - hope this list helped you see how the
09:25 - empty engine is capable of building
09:27 - anything the limits are really just your
09:28 - own skills and Imagination check out my
09:30 - own same game dinky Guardians and edit

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with young teen launch in June 23. this was quite an interesting month I thought perhaps there would be a few releases because the steam Festival but not really still tons of games and still very difficult to pick just 10. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test of these games are uniquely impressive so don't listen to no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick them also speaking of the steam Festival my own game dinky Guardians was part of it with a free demo which is still available right now it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation building and defense where you must keep the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from harm go try out a demo edit your wishlist and phone for devops alright so starting off at number 10 with a fun unique game called Driftwood this one is all about downhill longboarding and very importantly you play as a sloth so definitely a very nice genre but great presentation the concept of a sloth going downhill at high speeds is definitely quite interesting personally I love the original style very nice and appealing it looks like a more slightly casual racing game which personally I quite like you've got some drift controls to go down on turns in a nice satisfying way there's a trick system so you can do 360s and keep on going you can travel to new places and experience some interesting tracks all with a nice relaxing soundtrack you can play either solo for a nice casual time or if you prefer there is also a competitive mode where every second counts it is out now in Early Access with 200 very positive reviews then for some building and physics here is Mars personal Logistics it's a very physically accurate simulator where you build some machines from realistic pieces and set them up to complete all kinds of tasks like name implies you're on Mars so you start off with some basic machines just some wheels and Grabber easy to pick up a simple object and move it around then you complete some missions and unlock new parts to play with the level of customization is truly insane there are tons of parts that can be combined in an infinite way to build any machine you can think of the missions involve carrying all sorts of strangely shaped objects and you need to build your machine in such a way that it can actually pick up those objects also has a nice visual Style with some thick outlines several games have done this already and I think it always looks good if you like some realistic physics Simulator games and this looks like a great new one it is out now in Early Access with 200 very positive reviews next here's one that is definitely not for me but it does look great it's called killer frequency personally I am not a fan of horror games I get scared way too easily so I don't normally look at them for these lists but this one has so many insanely positive reviews that I just have to give it a look and it actually doesn't seem to have too many jump squares so perhaps I could even handle this one the premise is you're a late night radio talk show host where the colors are being installed by a mysterious color it's essentially a first person puzzle game through your choices you can decide who lives and who dies and either don't listen to their size of relief or their screams of horror explore your surroundings gather some Clues and try to help each of your colors survive the night the voice acting is absolutely excellent and Visually the game also looks gorgeous this is something that a lot of horror games do very well all the SSRS super high quality tons of great effects it is out now with 500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so that is 95 positive so if this intrigues you definitely give it a look next if you're into Colony building with tons of objects and tons of automation here is novolence you'll land on an alien planet and you have your trusty rayton weapon thingy that can help
