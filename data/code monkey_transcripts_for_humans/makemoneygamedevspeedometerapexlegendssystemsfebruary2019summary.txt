00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code man in
00:01 - this video we're going to review all the
00:03 - videos published in February 2019
00:06 - let's begin
00:09 - so February had a bunch of really great
00:11 - videos one of the coolest video was
00:14 - creating a speedometer this is a really
00:16 - great UI element and essential for
00:17 - anyone looking to make a car game
00:19 - there's a background a speed needle and
00:22 - very speed indicators these indicators
00:24 - are a completely dynamic so by changing
00:26 - the code we can change the max speed and
00:28 - how many segments we have they need on
00:30 - rotates around as you would expect and
00:32 - the whole element works quite nice there
00:35 - were two in-depth videos covering
00:37 - systems from apex legends the game has
00:39 - been very successful so it's always good
00:41 - to learn why that is there was a video
00:44 - on the health system it is pointing to a
00:46 - health bar and a shield bar the number
00:49 - of shield segments is dependent on the
00:50 - quality of the armor the player has
00:52 - equipped the health only goes down when
00:54 - the shield is plated and then we have
00:56 - various items that we can use to
00:57 - replenish either just the health or just
00:59 - a shield or both we have a nice damage
01:02 - effect that displays the amount of
01:03 - damage our help took with unless attack
01:05 - and also a very nice flashing warning
01:07 - when very low on health the other system
01:11 - from apex legends that we covered was
01:12 - the pink system which is one of the main
01:14 - reasons why the game has been so
01:16 - successful the pink system is very
01:18 - contact sensitive and with just a single
01:20 - button we can spawn a multitude of
01:22 - things to give different information to
01:24 - our teammates all the pings display
01:27 - their distance and have a secondary
01:28 - indicator for when they go outside of
01:30 - the screen we have the ability to do a
01:33 - normal move ping by just pressing
01:34 - somewhere with our ping button then by
01:37 - double clicking on the ping button we
01:39 - can spawn a enemy spotted ping by
01:42 - holding down the pink button we get a
01:44 - nice ping wheel that contains even more
01:46 - unique ping types and by using the ping
01:49 - button on top of an item we get a
01:51 - special ping highlighting that item
01:53 - again on pings display their distance
01:56 - and the direction towards them so you
01:58 - can see how versatile this system is
01:59 - despite only using a single button
02:02 - adding even more ping types is extremely
02:04 - simple due to the way that the code is
02:06 - setup so again a great element very
02:09 - versatile and very contact sensitive
02:11 - which makes it very easy to use whilst
02:13 - being extremely useful we had two more
02:16 - general talking advice videos the first
02:19 - one we looked into five price tiers that
02:21 - you can use for your indie game
02:23 - it ranges from free to more than $20 in
02:26 - the video I give my thoughts on what a
02:28 - player expects for each price point
02:30 - along with my own experiences if you're
02:33 - just starting out I recommend you value
02:35 - feedback more than money since
02:36 - experiences everything in game
02:38 - development then there was a video
02:41 - covering 5 ways to make money in game
02:43 - development I think this is a great
02:45 - video because it really shows you how
02:46 - there's a multitude of ways you can work
02:48 - in games the various options range from
02:51 - very stable to very risky you can be
02:54 - very stable working in a regular game
02:56 - studio however that means you don't have
02:58 - much say in to what you're going to
02:59 - create or you can have complete creative
03:02 - freedom by doing in any game and
03:04 - sacrificing stability so again a great
03:07 - video that shows various avenues that
03:09 - you can find success whilst working in
03:11 - games on there was also a video on a
03:15 - really cool meta bar with a animated
03:16 - texture it's a very simple bar but we
03:19 - polished it to make it look quite nice
03:21 - so we first created the base bar along
03:24 - with the code to handle spending and
03:25 - replenishing our mana then we took that
03:28 - bar and replace the basic solid color
03:30 - with a cone texture we animated that
03:33 - texture through code making point very
03:34 - nice
03:35 - we then at the border and an extra
03:38 - effect on the edge of the bar that is
03:39 - only visible whilst the bar is filling
03:41 - out the result is a very nice animated
03:44 - mana bar that would look great in any
03:46 - game we had the completion of the snake
03:49 - series this is a great series for a
03:51 - beginner since it goes from absolutely
03:53 - nothing to a completed game and the
03:55 - snake game design is very simple which
03:57 - makes it perfect for learning so this
03:59 - month we continue the series first by
04:01 - adding body corners to our sprites that
04:04 - way the snake looks much better when
04:05 - doing 90-degree turns then we added
04:08 - snake that by causing a game over when
04:10 - the head of the snake hits any part of
04:12 - its money we also had the ability for
04:14 - the snake to wrap around the level so
04:16 - when we go past the right edge the snake
04:18 - shows up on the left side after that we
04:21 - worked on creating the UI first we set
04:23 - up the UI canvas with a camera to
04:25 - display it and then we add a simple text
04:27 - field to display the current score we
04:30 - then created a class to handle loading
04:32 - of our scene so by adding a scene reload
04:34 - and a testing button
04:36 - we were able to retry playing the game
04:38 - whenever the snake dance then we convert
04:41 - that testing button into a proper game /
04:43 - window with all of that we have to work
04:46 - on creating a simple main menu we set up
04:49 - some buttons and a title text we have a
04:51 - button to play the game which loads our
04:53 - game scene a button to learn her play
04:55 - which shows a window that teaches the
04:57 - player the rules of the game and the
04:59 - quit button which quits the desktop then
05:02 - it was time to finally add some sound to
05:04 - our game so you got to work on creating
05:06 - a sound manager to handle pulling all of
05:07 - our sounds and we added sounds for snake
05:10 - move eat die and also for all of our
05:13 - buttons finally we set up the high score
05:17 - with saving and loading and display that
05:19 - only you want when the player beats the
05:21 - high-score he gets a congratulation
05:22 - message in the game / window and a new
05:24 - high score is safe so that's the snake
05:28 - series complete
05:29 - I plan to still make a video polishing
05:31 - up the final result but you can now go
05:34 - through the entire series and see the
05:35 - game being created from absolutely
05:37 - nothing until a very nice game there was
05:41 - a video covering how to make a high
05:42 - score table with saving and loading this
05:45 - is a pretty simple thing to do but very
05:46 - useful to almost any game we set up the
05:49 - window in the UI along with a template
05:51 - for our high score entries then we
05:53 - create our class to hold a list of high
05:55 - scores and display them on the table
05:57 - each entry contains the score and the
05:59 - name of the player we added saving and
06:03 - loading to our table using Jason and
06:05 - player prefs so all that is persistent
06:07 - between runs finally we polished our
06:10 - table with trophies for our top three
06:12 - players as well as highlighting the
06:13 - number one player we had the summary of
06:18 - the tooltip series this was a great
06:20 - series that teaches you how to make a
06:22 - tooltip which is an essential element if
06:24 - your game is UI having the first video
06:26 - starts off extremely simple with just
06:28 - basic tanta being shown and the
06:30 - background resized to match the text
06:31 - then we made sure our tooltip is always
06:34 - on screen and add the ability to update
06:35 - it in real time
06:37 - we then duplicate our class to make a
06:39 - separate on tip warning that flashes in
06:41 - red and is great for giving important
06:43 - warning information to the player and
06:45 - finally we were used on a lot of our
06:47 - tooltip code to turn it into an
06:49 - stats to tip that choose a image of the
06:51 - item on with the description and it
06:53 - stands again great element for giving
06:56 - information to the player and pretty
06:57 - much essential if your game is UI heavy
07:00 - there were two quick tip videos first
07:03 - covering how to view custom classes in
07:05 - the inspector by default you can only
07:07 - see the default data types in the
07:09 - inspector unlike inte boom in ohms and
07:11 - so on
07:11 - however by adding the serialize bone
07:14 - attribute you can make your custom
07:15 - classes show up as well this is right
07:18 - for example for showing a custom spawn
07:20 - positions class that contains a vector
07:22 - three a nth and whatever else that way
07:25 - everything is nice and grouped when you
07:27 - go into the editor then there was a
07:29 - video covering how to use debug that
07:31 - drawn line for testing it's a great tool
07:33 - to be used alongside debug log but
07:36 - instead of text we can draw a line in
07:38 - our world you can show or hide lines by
07:40 - enabling or disabling gizmos this is a
07:44 - great tool for example for debugging a
07:45 - pathfinding system you can draw the
07:47 - lines to see what path was calculated we
07:50 - also have the completion of the modular
07:52 - sprite sheets as used for guests in
07:54 - battleground tycoon first we added body
07:57 - primary and secondary colors this video
08:00 - teaches you how to make a texture which
08:02 - acts as a mask for several separate
08:04 - areas so using the same masks we can
08:07 - define where we want to tint a primary
08:09 - color and where to tint a secondary cone
08:11 - finally in the last video of the series
08:13 - we covered saving and loading of the
08:15 - exact same sprite so we can generate a
08:18 - completely random sprite using all the
08:20 - parameters we covered then we put that
08:22 - sprite information in a save object and
08:24 - we save it that way we can always load
08:27 - the exact same sprite every single time
08:29 - so that was it for the completed series
08:32 - covering how guest frets work in been
08:34 - around that good the game is on Steam so
08:36 - you can pick it up to see this system
08:38 - being used in a real game so that was it
08:41 - for the month of February 2019
08:44 - I hope you found the videos helpful and
08:45 - learned something along the way if you
08:47 - have any questions regarding any of the
08:49 - videos feel free to post them in the
08:50 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
08:52 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
08:53 - see you next time
09:06 - you

hello and welcome I'm your code man in this video we're going to review all the videos published in February 2019 let's begin so February had a bunch of really great videos one of the coolest video

price point along with my own experiences if you're just starting out I recommend you value feedback more than money since experiences everything in game development then there was a video covering 5 ways to make money in game development I think this is a great video because it really shows you how there's a multitude of ways you can work in games the various options range from very stable to very risky you can be very stable working in a regular game studio however that means you don't have much say in to what you're going to create or you can have complete creative freedom by doing in any game and sacrificing stability so again a great video that shows various avenues that you can find success whilst working in games on there was also a video on a really cool meta bar with a
