00:08 - app was meant to come out on monday
00:09 - however if you check the page you'll see

00:23 - i've uploaded the launch bill there's a
00:24 - launch trailer on the store page and it
00:26 - all works great
00:28 - i've tried contacting steam support but
00:30 - the only response i get is to simply
00:31 - wait so i have no idea when the app will
00:33 - be approved
00:34 - so like i said it's already on my end so
