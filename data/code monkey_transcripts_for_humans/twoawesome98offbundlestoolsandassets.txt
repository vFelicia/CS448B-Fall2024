00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your cmy and
00:02 - here's a nice December surprise two
00:04 - excellent bundles are now available I
00:06 - was wondering if this year there would
00:07 - be something to match absolutely
00:09 - excellent bundles of last year and
00:10 - finally there's something like it there
00:12 - is a Unity Mega bundle I was planning to
00:14 - do a video just on this one because it
00:16 - does have tons of awesome stuff and then
00:18 - out of nowhere Humble Bundle also made a
00:20 - Unity bundle also with tons of awesome
00:21 - stuff as always these bundles are on a
00:23 - super deep discount so if just one thing
00:25 - looks interesting then the home bundle
00:27 - is worth it and regardless of what game
00:28 - you're making there's definitely more
00:30 - than two Assets in these that I'm sure
00:31 - you'll find very helpful so first over
00:33 - here on the Humble Bundle this one has
00:34 - 30 tools and assets for 35 bucks
00:37 - technically you can just pick the first
00:39 - year you can just get this one for a
00:41 - buck maybe if these are the specific ass
00:43 - that you need but the whole thing has
00:44 - such a huge discount that you might as
00:46 - well just get them all first thing is
00:47 - the survival engine this one is a ful
00:50 - featured complete Survival game template
00:52 - it features crafting building farming it
00:54 - works in Mobile and PC Works in first
00:56 - and third person these complete
00:58 - templates are always great for quickly
00:59 - making some some prototypes although
01:00 - personally I prefer similar tools that
01:02 - do just one thing like for example this
01:04 - next one right here the mesh slicer like
01:05 - name implies this lets you slice some
01:07 - meshes now in a previous video I showed
01:09 - how to add destruction to your games you
01:11 - can slice meshes with probuilder but
01:13 - that tool is experimental and sometimes
01:14 - crashes so if you want something that
01:16 - just works and has tons of features
01:17 - including realtime slicing then this one
01:19 - looks great something that helps you
01:21 - make better games is getting feedback
01:22 - from your players so if so here's a
01:24 - great feedback form you can easily
01:26 - receive bug reports from your players
01:27 - including screenshots and any extra data
01:30 - then if you have a car game here's a
01:31 - tool to help you add vehicle physics
01:33 - that's one of those things that is
01:34 - really hard to get right so getting a
01:35 - proper asset is a huge timesaver or if
01:38 - you want a complete car game template
01:40 - then the Hard Road engine would be a
01:41 - great starting point this one is made by
01:43 - the same developer that made feel and
01:45 - the Corgi engine and the top down engine
01:46 - so this is a great asset made by asset
01:48 - professionals if you have character
01:50 - especially in a low poly you can make
01:52 - them come alive by adding some talking
01:53 - with this tool it automatically animates
01:55 - the character's mouth along with some
01:57 - audio if you have some performance
01:59 - issues it can try solving that with a
02:00 - dynamic mesh combiner if you have a 2d
02:02 - game that you want to be squishy use a
02:04 - 2d soft body one tiny but very impactful
02:07 - Polish thing is adding a dynamic Lan to
02:08 - your characters you can do that easily
02:10 - with this asset and this bubish share
02:12 - has another one for making some really
02:13 - great Tails or manage your assets add
02:16 - some lens flares pick up a dialog system
02:18 - do some visual scripting get some
02:20 - projectiles get some tune effects
02:22 - transfer some files load something and
02:24 - so on so this is a huge bundle with tons
02:26 - of super interesting stuff and again the
02:27 - whole thing for 35 bucks so if just want
02:29 - of these is interesting then the whole
02:31 - bundle is worth it and then Unity has
02:33 - their own Mega bundle this one is also
02:35 - excellent these are 23 asses for 23
02:37 - bucks again a great deal even if all you
02:39 - need is just one here you have a
02:41 - gorgeous stylized environment or if
02:43 - that's too cheery check out this
02:44 - industrial Factory perhaps you need a
02:47 - ton of gorgeous looking orus or simply a
02:49 - nice postprocessing effect to make your
02:50 - scenes look really pixelated if you're
02:52 - annoyed with how long your code takes a
02:54 - run then perhaps look into the Liv
02:55 - script reload if you want to make
02:57 - something like an old school retro game
02:58 - then this template looks excellent I
03:00 - just recently made a character
03:02 - customization system you can download
03:03 - your project file for that one and apply
03:05 - it to a pack like this one or make your
03:07 - game a bit more spooky and interesting
03:09 - by adding a punch of fog you can add a
03:11 - bunch of transitions to make your scene
03:12 - changes a bit more interesting then
03:14 - you've got a mobile FPS you've got the
03:16 - LSS to make your game Run much better a
03:18 - bunch of super useful editor tools some
03:20 - more UI a really nice Port City and here
03:22 - is one that I'm actually surprised to
03:23 - see in a bundle this one looks like a
03:25 - really excellent really complete Game
03:27 - template I saw this one in one of my
03:29 - assd videos because they look really
03:30 - excellent It's got some automated food
03:32 - placement then you can make some third
03:34 - person melee games you can make a top
03:36 - down shooter you can make an FPS game
03:39 - with tons of movement make it a s
03:41 - scrolling shooter it features inventory
03:43 - it's got Mobile support you can modify
03:45 - the gravity you can even add some
03:47 - Vehicles so yeah this one alone looks
03:48 - really impressive and it has five star
03:50 - reviews I've never used it but it looks
03:51 - really great so just this one alone
03:53 - makes the home bundle worth it and
03:55 - everything else is really just a really
03:56 - nice bonus honestly personally I really
03:58 - love the state of assets nowadays when I
04:01 - got started making games I had to build
04:02 - everything myself and my games were
04:04 - always visually horrible because I have
04:05 - no skills as an artist whereas nowadays
04:08 - you can just pick up some super useful
04:09 - tools and some really gorgeous assets to
04:11 - help me make some really excellent games
04:13 - if I was just getting started right now
04:14 - I would definitely pick up these and
04:15 - spend the next month making several
04:17 - really interesting prototypes with all
04:18 - these tools and assets so I really hope
04:20 - that these help you on your Game Dev
04:21 - Journey as always the links in the
04:23 - description those are a film links which
04:25 - means if you click on them and you buy
04:26 - them it's the same price to you and I
04:27 - get a nice commission all right so
04:29 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
04:30 - next time
