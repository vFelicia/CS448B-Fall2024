00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset source full of awesome tools
00:04 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for february 202.
00:11 - in this first video i will be covering a
00:13 - list of free assets and in the next ones
00:14 - i will be covering paid assets and tools
00:16 - check out the phone playlist to see all
00:18 - of the highlights every month you might
00:19 - find something that would be perfect for
00:21 - whatever project you're currently
00:22 - working on let me know in the comments
00:24 - if you pick up any of these and what you
00:25 - intend to do with them do you want to
00:27 - learn unity blender and programming
00:29 - patterns then check out my curated code
00:31 - monkey bundle with a link in the
00:32 - description this is a collaboration with
00:34 - gamedev tv all their courses have the
00:36 - highest rating possible i got in touch
00:38 - with them to specifically select three
00:40 - courses to make a nice complete bundle
00:42 - to take you from beginner to advanced i
00:44 - chose their ultimate unity 3d course
00:46 - this one will teach you both unity and
00:47 - c-sharp both starting complete from
00:49 - scratch then the blender 3d modeling
00:52 - course i picked this one up myself a few
00:54 - months ago and i've learned a ton thanks
00:55 - to it and the final one is a more
00:57 - advanced really interesting programming
00:59 - course all about programming patterns
01:01 - it's excellent for helping you massively
01:03 - improve the quality of your code which
01:04 - in turn helps you make better games
01:06 - faster i chose all of these cores myself
01:08 - to really give you a nice path to go
01:09 - from beginner to advanced the bundle has
01:11 - a really nice discount so check it out
01:13 - with a link in the description alright
01:14 - so starting off with a great car
01:16 - controller it uses wheel converters to
01:18 - make it on work you can set up the
01:20 - maximum speed forwards and backwards you
01:22 - can set up acceleration braking steering
01:24 - speed and tons more
01:26 - also it says in the title that this one
01:28 - is also a learning tool not sure how
01:30 - that works there's a tutorial in the
01:32 - asset store page maybe the code is
01:33 - heavily commented
01:35 - card driving is one of the topics that i
01:37 - haven't really covered only made a
01:38 - single tutorial so if you want to learn
01:40 - then maybe look into this free asset and
01:42 - study it then if you need a nice
01:44 - medieval house here's a simple one that
01:46 - looks pretty good features both interior
01:48 - and x-series it seems to be all in one
01:50 - piece but i think you could just load it
01:52 - into blender and cut some pieces to make
01:54 - some real nice modules either way it
01:56 - looks really nice or maybe you need a
01:58 - character here's a cartoony humanoid
02:00 - animal it's a nice stylized character
02:03 - also includes quite a bunch of
02:04 - animations so very easy to just drag and
02:07 - drop onto your project and start using
02:08 - it if you need some hit particle effects
02:10 - check out this one quite a bunch of
02:12 - variety and lots of colors
02:14 - you have hits explosions and slashes or
02:17 - maybe you're working on a fighting game
02:18 - and you need some sprites check out this
02:20 - one it's got 2d sprites in all kinds of
02:22 - poses there's not much animation which
02:24 - actually makes for an interesting style
02:26 - reminds me of divekick which was a very
02:29 - successful game and also had some very
02:30 - unlimited animations if you're building
02:33 - some kind of survival crafting game and
02:35 - you need some tools look at this one
02:36 - it's a nice pack you've got six tools so
02:39 - you have an axe pickaxe shovel scythe
02:41 - hoe and hammer they are low poly with a
02:44 - simplified shape and some materials
02:45 - which look really great then for some
02:47 - realistic firework effects look at this
02:49 - one they'll look very realistic made
02:51 - with the visual effect graph very easy
02:53 - to use just drag and drop also you can
02:55 - customize all the colors sizes timings
02:57 - and everything if you need some simple
02:59 - icons for a game check out this free
03:01 - pack lots of varied icons so you've got
03:04 - things for options sounds some links
03:06 - maybe some keyboard microphone home and
03:08 - tons more they have a simple visual
03:11 - sound so with some hue shifting or some
03:13 - color tinting you can get tons of
03:14 - variation then here's an interesting
03:16 - free tool a json model creator
03:19 - this one can be helpful to visualize the
03:21 - structure of your data you can add some
03:23 - fields select their types choose array
03:25 - or single this is only json so it's a
03:28 - widely used format you can make the
03:30 - model here and use it anywhere and if
03:32 - you're making a retro game here is retro
03:34 - screen it makes your game view very
03:36 - pixelated so very retro it's very simple
03:39 - does exactly just one thing you drag and
03:41 - drop the script onto the camera and it
03:42 - just works alright so those are my top
03:45 - 10 free new assets on the ent assessor
03:47 - for february 2012. there's links to all
03:49 - in the description stay tuned for the
03:51 - next videos covering paid assets and
03:52 - tools there's lots of awesome stuff

03:55 - see some more lists with free and paid
