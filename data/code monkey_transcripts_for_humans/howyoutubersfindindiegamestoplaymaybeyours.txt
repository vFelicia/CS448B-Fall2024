00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm nowadays
00:02 - having a big YouTuber or streamer player
00:04 - game can be the massive difference
00:06 - between failure or success it can get
00:08 - you tens of thousands of wish list
00:09 - before release or thousands upon
00:11 - thousands sales after release for
00:13 - example vampire survivors launch without
00:15 - much recognition but after splid cat
00:17 - covered it in the video it became a huge
00:18 - massive hit before that point it had
00:20 - sold almost zero copies and after that
00:22 - video it started a massive snowball that
00:24 - eventually end up with over 3 million
00:26 - copies sold so in order to get your
00:27 - games covered by these streamers and
00:29 - YouTubers in order to do that it helps
00:30 - you learn how things work from the other
00:32 - side meaning how do content creators
00:34 - actually find games to cover and
00:35 - thankfully some of these creators have
00:36 - posted some great info on exactly this
00:38 - topic how they find new games to cover
00:40 - and how you can do some things in order
00:41 - to increase your odds of finding success
00:43 - now for me since I usually don't have
00:45 - too much time to play many games for
00:47 - that the way that I usually keep up is
00:48 - by watching videos mainly from some
00:50 - variety YouTubers so mainly splatter cat
00:53 - wonderbots and Orbit on potato I
00:55 - normally watch these videos on 2 or 3 XP
00:57 - that's pretty much how I can keep up
00:59 - with all the tons and tons of awesome
01:00 - games that are coming out and funly
01:01 - enough two of these actually covered my
01:03 - game which was pretty surreal so here's
01:05 - an interesting post by wonderbots
01:07 - talking about eight separate methods
01:08 - where he finds new games to cover then
01:10 - there's another one which has a really
01:11 - awesome checking list for how to contact
01:13 - cont creators there's also a game
01:15 - discover code interview with splattercat
01:17 - and an interesting Twitter thread from
01:18 - Blitz who is also another variety
01:20 - YouTuber all this is tons of super
01:22 - valuable info for us as developers in
01:23 - order to figure out how to best contact
01:25 - creators and it's actually no surprise
01:27 - how most of them say pretty much exact
01:28 - same thing for me I I know the
01:30 - importance that con creators have in
01:31 - today's market in order to find success
01:33 - at any games marketing is really super
01:35 - important nowadays if you want to find
01:37 - success you need to do marketing I made
01:38 - an entire video with a bunch of my
01:40 - knowledge on this topic I frequently
01:42 - recommend the game discover code
01:43 - newsletter as well as the how to market
01:45 - the game newsletter both these are
01:47 - really awesome sources for indie game
01:48 - marketing I highly recommend you read
01:49 - them a few months ago I released my nine
01:51 - seam game dinky Gardens and I tried to
01:54 - apply all these sips myself and
01:55 - thankfully I did get a bit of nice
01:57 - coverage I was really happy to see a
01:58 - bunch of videos of people playing the
02:00 - game and the game has since hit my goals
02:02 - for Success so how do you contact
02:04 - content creators and the first really
02:06 - important thing to keep in mind is
02:07 - exactly what pit says over here the
02:09 - first thing is to remember that it's our
02:10 - job to First entertain the viewers
02:12 - second to pay our bills and third to
02:13 - promote your game so always remember to
02:15 - look at things from this point of view
02:17 - the goal for these content creators is
02:19 - like it says here first to make an
02:20 - entertaining video then to pay their own
02:22 - bills and only thirdly only a very
02:24 - distant third is to actually promote
02:25 - your game so make sure you do always
02:28 - remember that the main purpose of these
02:30 - cont creators is not to promote your
02:31 - game that's pretty much just an
02:33 - accidental side effect of the fact that
02:34 - they need games to cover so looking here
02:36 - at this really nice list that has eight
02:38 - methods the main one is email this is
02:41 - the one that is true for pretty much all
02:42 - content creators it's a simplest most
02:45 - straightfor thing just send out an email
02:46 - to all kinds of people however there's
02:48 - also a big difference between a good
02:49 - email and a bad email so there's this
02:51 - really nice check list for how to
02:53 - contact how to write a good email so
02:55 - first of all it should have an easy to
02:56 - parse email title so either first the
02:58 - game or make some catchy 5w hook again
03:01 - remember to look at things from the
03:02 - point of view of these creators they get
03:04 - tons and tons of emails so definitely
03:05 - make sure that your email is super easy
03:07 - to parse and read then includes some
03:09 - kind of release date any kind of embargo
03:11 - information although if you are a small
03:12 - solo IND The Game Dev I would probably
03:14 - not try going for an embargo in most
03:16 - case that just adds needless complexity
03:18 - then the basic game info so the genre
03:20 - available platforms price and a quick
03:21 - summary all super important is put a
03:24 - primary sront link probably a link to
03:25 - your steam page then if you do have a
03:27 - key if the game is ready to play if so
03:29 - make sure you include that game key very
03:31 - importantly do not make content creators
03:33 - jump through hoops in order to cover
03:34 - your game so don't say click over here
03:36 - in order to send me an email to request
03:38 - a key so definitely don't do that send
03:40 - them a key right away and hope that they
03:41 - cover it and then of course trailer
03:43 - screenshots or gameplay gift then the
03:45 - usual press kit including logos key art
03:47 - those are really important a bunch of
03:49 - screenshots some gameplay characters
03:51 - trailers game ass and gameplay gifts so
03:53 - this is a really use small check list if
03:54 - you follow this your emails are going to
03:55 - be much better than the average person
03:57 - for contacts here is an example email
03:59 - that I out myself where I obviously try
04:01 - to follow all these guidelines so for
04:03 - title I included s key because the email
04:05 - does contain seam key then right away
04:07 - the name of the game and the genre of
04:08 - the game so pretty much as shorten to
04:10 - the point as I can make it then just
04:12 - include the short description for the
04:14 - game I include the image over here
04:16 - including the reviews just so that they
04:17 - could see that the game is being well
04:19 - received and then of course importantly
04:20 - right up top over here is the steam key
04:23 - both the steam key as well as a link
04:24 - directly to the seam page then down here
04:26 - a ton more links so a link for the
04:28 - launch trailer some behind behind the
04:29 - scenes devlogs and then a bunch of logo
04:32 - assets importantly is how these are
04:34 - transparent pgs this is one thing that
04:36 - splattercat mentions in this interview
04:38 - so one big thing is to have a banger
04:40 - presskit with all materials needed to
04:41 - make some great thumbnails now I can
04:43 - tell you from my perspective as a gamd
04:45 - YouTuber that thumbnails are indeed
04:46 - extremely important over here on YouTube
04:48 - if the video is really great but nobody
04:50 - clicks on the thumbnail then doesn't
04:51 - really matter so making really great
04:53 - thumbnails is absolutely key and in
04:55 - order for these developers who cover
04:56 - games in order to make a good thumbnail
04:58 - they need to have the enough assets in
04:59 - order to build a great compelling
05:00 - thumbnail so that means that your game
05:02 - needs to be visually interesting and
05:04 - your presskit needs to contain enough
05:05 - assets so that these creators can build
05:07 - some really awesome compelling
05:08 - thumbnails if you want to see what makes
05:10 - an awesome compelling thumbnail if so
05:12 - you can just go and browse EV video list
05:13 - you can see all these videos and compare
05:15 - all the views between them that is
05:16 - obviously going to be dependent on the
05:18 - game itself the concept itself but part
05:20 - of it on the concept and part of it also
05:21 - on the thumbnail use and the way that
05:23 - they can make some awesome thumbnails is
05:24 - by you the developer giving them enough
05:26 - assets so in your press kit make sure
05:28 - you include as much assets as you can
05:30 - then over here for the rest of the email
05:31 - I just include a bunch of gifts I
05:33 - include a more detailed description of
05:35 - what the game is all about and in the
05:36 - end again reminding the link then on the
05:38 - email just make sure it's short and
05:40 - quick don't include a massive all text
05:42 - talking about all your game all the Lord
05:44 - in the game and all that blit points out
05:45 - the exact same thing keeping it short
05:47 - and including a link and some visuals
05:49 - and also don't clickbait so pretty much
05:51 - what I was saying a while ago if it says
05:53 - team key inside make sure you do include
05:55 - a s key inside so don't include some
05:57 - kind of dumb link to a Google form and
05:58 - force the Creator to do some work on
06:00 - their end make it as easy as possible
06:02 - for them to redeem the key and start
06:03 - playing your game right away let's post
06:04 - an example email from the game doe
06:06 - keeper this game is a massive Mega hit
06:09 - both in terms of sales and also in terms
06:10 - of getting creators to cover the game
06:12 - although once again it all starts by
06:13 - having an excellent game to begin with I
06:15 - would say this EML is a little bit too
06:17 - simple in order to convert properly but
06:19 - since the game was excellent and I'm
06:20 - guessing by the point that this EML came
06:21 - out the game was already pre popular
06:23 - because that they can get away with just
06:25 - having a super simple email just all the
06:26 - information nothing else just a simple
06:28 - link and that's it so do keep in mind
06:30 - that pretty much everything that I'm
06:31 - saying here everything in all these
06:33 - checklists and all this this is all
06:34 - really just a multiplayer that works on
06:36 - top of your game if your game is great
06:38 - then these will multiply your game and
06:39 - find massive success but if your game
06:41 - isn't as good or isn't simply as
06:42 - compelling if so then all of these tips
06:44 - and tricks won't really do all that much
06:46 - so anyways that's how you craft a good
06:48 - email but like we saw email is really
06:50 - just the first method that these
06:51 - creators find games let's see the other
06:53 - ones then method number two and three
06:55 - are both all about demos both the steam
06:57 - demos page as well as importantly the SE
06:59 - next Fest a lot of these creators make a
07:01 - ton of videos every time there's a seam
07:03 - Festival coming around so that's yet
07:05 - another reason as to how these festivals
07:06 - are super valuable to you as an indie
07:08 - game developer if your game does find
07:10 - traction on a s Festival if so then
07:12 - these creators won see your game even
07:13 - without having to see the emails and
07:15 - also an interesting note over here if
07:16 - you are Dev launching a demo on seam I
07:18 - highly recommend buffing up your
07:19 - branding it's one of the best ways to
07:21 - stand out especially against a crown of
07:22 - games with extremely low effort art
07:25 - basically to say that the Steam capsu
07:26 - for your steam game that's basically the
07:28 - little image and little icon for a game
07:30 - make sure that one is always super high
07:31 - quality so even if you are for example a
07:33 - programmer and all you can do is program
07:35 - an art I would still definitely
07:36 - encourage you in order to hire an artist
07:37 - at least to do just a capsule because
07:39 - that one does matter so much then method
07:41 - number four here we have an interesting
07:43 - One calendar sites this is definitely
07:45 - much more of a nich thing I do know
07:46 - there are some game calendars but
07:48 - usually they're really only available to
07:50 - either aleaa games or aleaa Indies so if
07:52 - you're a small indie game Dove kind of
07:53 - like myself usually these calend are
07:55 - pretty much impossible to get on to then
07:57 - next one is just social media in general
07:59 - so that I've said many times is how
08:00 - Twitter is actually pretty bad in order
08:02 - to find players for your games usually
08:04 - if you post on Twitter unless your game
08:05 - goes Super viral in most case chances
08:07 - are it's really only going to hit other
08:09 - developers so it's really not a great
08:11 - place in order to find players however
08:12 - like it says here it can be a great
08:14 - place in order to find con creators or
08:15 - potentially Publishers so if you can do
08:18 - that if you have the bandwidth in order
08:19 - to post on Twitter already if so these
08:21 - can be useful specifically for the point
08:23 - of attracting cont creators or
08:25 - Publishers however don't expect to find
08:27 - success with players themselves next
08:28 - method is Discord and specifically what
08:30 - he says here Discord is the best way my
08:32 - audience suggests games to me so as with
08:34 - so many things peer recommendations are
08:36 - really important sa if your game has
08:37 - enough hype that the audience for these
08:39 - channels the audiences themselves are
08:41 - actually suggesting your game to play
08:42 - that is a really great place to be but
08:44 - of course that is really difficult to
08:45 - achieve but if you can achieve that is
08:46 - definitely one of the best ways to get
08:48 - these content creators to cover your
08:49 - game then method number seven seam NE
08:51 - lases so at this point I feel that this
08:53 - one is pretty much just the UN luck of
08:54 - the draw sometimes you might launch a
08:56 - game and for some reason you might get
08:58 - lucky and some con Creator is is too
08:59 - bored and doesn't have anything to cover
09:01 - and they just browse it and they find
09:02 - your game but I wouldn't really rely on
09:04 - this one in order to find success and
09:06 - same thing for the other one sales so
09:08 - sales are great way to give your game a
09:10 - little bit more coverage give it a boost
09:12 - on the SE algor in order to find more
09:13 - players for your game and again maybe
09:15 - you'll get lucky and some con Creator W
09:17 - see your game for the very first time in
09:18 - play it but again another thing that I
09:20 - would not rely on so those are the eight
09:22 - methods but over here you also asked all
09:24 - of his friends that also do the same
09:25 - thing on how do they find games so
09:27 - splatter cat mostly finds games in his
09:28 - inbox and also browse the seam new
09:30 - releases but importantly only when
09:32 - things are a little slow retoration uses
09:34 - Twitter recommendation from friends and
09:36 - watch the tee new releases section then
09:38 - Yuri from IND gs.com apparently use the
09:40 - Game Dev and indie game tags on Twitter
09:42 - clamy from best Indie Games uses email
09:44 - as well as the contact form so as you
09:46 - can see most of these fine games roughly
09:47 - in the same ways if you take the time to
09:49 - learn from these cont creators and how
09:51 - they work if you do that and you follow
09:52 - these guidelines if so then it's going
09:54 - to greatly help your chances of finding
09:55 - success but at the same time let me make
09:57 - two notes here so first one is like I
09:59 - said all of these tips these are really
10:01 - just multipliers that work on top of
10:03 - your game so before all of this the
10:05 - first thing you need to do is pick a
10:06 - good compelling game a compelling hook a
10:08 - compelling interesting thing to play it
10:10 - all starts by that and these hips are
10:12 - pretty much just multipliers working on
10:13 - top of that and the second very
10:15 - important note is just make sure to not
10:17 - take it personally when things don't
10:18 - happen so if you send out all these
10:20 - emails you follow all these rules but
10:21 - you still have no coverage if so then
10:23 - don't take it personal remember that
10:24 - these con creators those are really just
10:26 - people they're all just doing their job
10:28 - so if they don't cover your game that's
10:30 - really nothing personal perhaps it got
10:32 - lost in the thousands and thousands of
10:33 - emails that they get or perhaps there
10:35 - were tons of awesome games coming out at
10:37 - that exact time maybe they just don't
10:39 - think that it's going to make some kind
10:40 - of entertaining video or perhaps it
10:42 - simply does not fit Their audience maybe
10:44 - it just won't make a clickable ball
10:45 - title in thumbnail or perhaps it's quite
10:47 - simply just not the type of game that
10:49 - they enjoy to play basically there are
10:50 - many many reasons why you might not get
10:52 - any coverage even if you try doing
10:54 - absolutely everything right so if you do
10:55 - get coverage that's really awesome but
10:57 - if you don't then don't take it
10:58 - personally so definitely do find these
11:00 - guidelines in order to increase your
11:01 - outs of finding success but also
11:02 - remember to look at things from the
11:04 - point of view of these creators again
11:05 - their first goal is to entertain the
11:07 - viewers the second goal is to pay their
11:08 - own bills and only thirdly it is to
11:10 - promote your game so I hope this info
11:12 - helps you find success with your own
11:13 - games if you want to play my own game
11:15 - you can check it out on Steam it's a fun
11:17 - automation Colony building defense game
11:19 - or if you want to learn all about C then
11:21 - check out my complete C course all right
11:23 - so thanks for watching and I'll see you
11:24 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your codm nowadays having a big YouTuber or streamer player game can be the massive difference between failure or success it can get you tens of thousands of wish list before release or thousands upon thousands sales after release for example vampire survivors launch without much recognition but after splid cat covered it in the video it became a huge massive hit before that point it had sold almost zero copies and after that video it started a massive snowball that eventually end up with over 3 million copies sold so in order to get your games covered by these streamers and YouTubers in order to do that it helps you learn how things work from the other side meaning how do content creators actually find games to cover and thankfully some of these creators have posted some great info on exactly this topic how they find new games to cover and how you can do some things in order to increase your odds of finding success now for me since I usually don't have too much time to play many games for that the way that I usually keep up is by watching videos mainly from some variety YouTubers so mainly splatter cat wonderbots and Orbit on potato I normally watch these videos on 2 or 3 XP that's pretty much how I can keep up with all the tons and tons of awesome games that are coming out and funly enough two of these actually covered my game which was pretty surreal so here's an interesting post by wonderbots talking about eight separate methods where he finds new games to cover then there's another one which has a really awesome checking list for how to contact cont creators there's also a game discover code interview with splattercat and an interesting Twitter thread from Blitz who is also another variety YouTuber all this is tons of super valuable info for us as developers in order to figure out how to best contact creators and it's actually no surprise how most of them say pretty much exact same thing for me I I know the importance that con creators have in today's market in order to find success at any games marketing is really super important nowadays if you want to find success you need to do marketing I made an entire video with a bunch of my knowledge on this topic I frequently recommend the game discover code newsletter as well as the how to market the game newsletter both these are really awesome sources for indie game marketing I highly recommend you read them a few months ago I released my nine seam game dinky Gardens and I tried to apply all these sips myself and thankfully I did get a bit of nice coverage I was really happy to see a bunch of videos of people playing the game and the game has since hit my goals for Success so how do you contact content creators and the first really important thing to keep in mind is exactly what pit says over here the first thing is to remember that it's our job to First entertain the viewers second to pay our bills and third to promote your game so always remember to

although if you are a small solo IND The Game Dev I would probably not try going for an embargo in most case that just adds needless complexity then the basic game info so the genre available platforms price and a quick summary all super important is put a primary sront link probably a link to your steam page then if you do have a key if the game is ready to play if so make sure you include that game key very importantly do not make content creators jump through hoops in order to cover your game so don't say click over here in order to send me an email to request a key so definitely don't do that send them a key right away and hope that they cover it and then of course trailer screenshots or gameplay gift then the usual press kit including logos key art those are really important a bunch of screenshots some gameplay characters trailers game ass and gameplay gifts so this is a really use small check list if you follow this your emails are going to be much better than the average person for contacts here is an example email that I out myself where I obviously try to follow all these guidelines so for title I included s key because the email does contain

by you the developer giving them enough assets so in your press kit make sure you include as much assets as you can then over here for the rest of the email I just include a bunch of gifts I include a more detailed description of what the game is all about and in the end again reminding the link then on the email just make sure it's short and quick don't include a massive all text talking about all your game all the Lord in the game and all that blit points out the exact same thing keeping it short and including a link and some visuals and also don't clickbait so pretty much what I was saying a while ago if it says team key inside make sure you do include a s key inside so don't include some kind of dumb link to a Google form and force the Creator to do some work on their end make it as easy as possible for them to redeem the key and start playing your game right away let's post an example email from the game doe keeper this game is a massive Mega hit both in terms of sales and also in terms of getting creators to cover the game although once again it all starts by having an excellent game to begin with I would say this EML is a little bit too simple in order to convert properly but since the game was excellent and I'm guessing by the point that this EML came out the game was already pre popular because that they can get away with just having a super simple email just all the information nothing else just a simple link and that's it so do keep in mind that pretty much everything that I'm saying here everything in all these checklists and all this this is all really just a multiplayer that works on top of your game if your game is great then these will multiply your game and find massive success but if your game isn't as good or isn't simply as compelling if so then all of these tips and tricks won't really do all that much so anyways that's how you craft a good email but like we saw email is really just the first method that these creators find games let's see the other ones then method number two and three are both all about demos both the steam demos page as well as importantly the SE next Fest a lot of these creators make a ton of videos every time there's a seam Festival coming around so that's yet another reason as to how these festivals are super valuable to you as an indie game developer if your game does find traction on a s Festival if so then these creators won see your game even without having to see the emails and also an interesting note over here if you are Dev launching a demo on seam I highly recommend buffing up your branding it's one of the best ways to stand out especially against a crown of games with extremely low effort art basically to say that the Steam capsu for your steam game that's basically the little image and little icon for a game make sure that one is always super high quality so even if you are for example a programmer and all you can do is program an art I would still definitely encourage you in order to hire an artist at least to do just a capsule because that one does matter so much then method number four here we have an interesting One calendar sites this is definitely much more of a nich thing I do know there are some game calendars but usually they're really only available to either aleaa games or aleaa Indies so if you're a small indie game Dove kind of like myself usually these calend are pretty much impossible to get on to then next one is just social media in general so that I've said many times is how Twitter is actually pretty bad in order to find players for your games usually if you post on Twitter unless your game goes Super viral in most case chances are it's really only going to hit other developers so it's really not a great place in order to find players however like it says here it can be a great place in order to find con creators or potentially Publishers so if you can do that if you have the bandwidth in order to post on Twitter already if so these can be useful specifically for the point of attracting cont creators or Publishers however don't expect to find success with players themselves next method is Discord and specifically what he says here Discord is the best way my audience suggests games to me so as with so many things peer recommendations are really important sa if your game has enough hype that the audience for these channels the audiences themselves are actually suggesting your game to play that is a really great place to be but of course that is really difficult to achieve but if you can achieve that is definitely one of the best ways to get these content creators to cover your game then method number seven seam NE lases so at this point I feel that this one is pretty much just the UN luck of the draw sometimes you might launch a game and for some reason you might get lucky and some con Creator is is too bored and doesn't have anything to cover and they just browse it and they find your game but I wouldn't really rely on this one in order to find success and same thing for the other one sales so sales are great way to give your game a little bit more coverage give it a boost on the SE algor in order to find more players for your game and again maybe you'll get lucky and some con Creator W see your game for the very first time in play it but again another thing that I would not rely on so those are the eight methods but over here you also asked all of his friends that also do the same thing on how do they find games so splatter cat mostly finds games in his inbox and also browse the seam new releases but importantly only when things are a little slow retoration uses Twitter recommendation from friends and watch the tee new releases section then Yuri from IND gs.com apparently use the Game Dev and indie game tags on Twitter clamy from best Indie Games uses email as well as the contact form so as you can see most of these fine games roughly in the same ways if you take the time to learn from these cont creators and how they work if you do that and you follow these guidelines if so then it's going to greatly help your chances of finding success but at the same time let me make two notes here so first one is like I said all of these tips these are really just multipliers that work on top of your game so before all of this the first thing you need to do is pick a good compelling game a compelling hook a compelling interesting thing to play it all starts by that and these hips are pretty much just multipliers working on top of that and the second very important note is just make sure to not take it personally when things don't happen so if you send out all these emails you follow all these rules but you still have no coverage if so then don't take it personal remember that these con creators those are really just people they're all just doing their job so if they don't cover your game that's really nothing personal perhaps it got lost in the thousands and thousands of emails that they get or perhaps there were tons of awesome games coming out at that exact time maybe they just don't think that it's going to make some kind of entertaining video or perhaps it simply does not fit Their audience maybe it just won't make a clickable ball title in thumbnail or perhaps it's quite simply just not the type of game that they enjoy to play basically there are many many reasons why you might not get any coverage even if you try doing absolutely everything right so if you do get coverage that's really awesome but if you don't then don't take it personally so definitely do find these guidelines in order to increase your outs of finding success but also remember to look at things from the point of view of these creators again their first goal is to entertain the viewers the second goal is to pay their own bills and only thirdly it is to promote your game so I hope this info helps you find success with your own games if you want to play my own game you can check it out on Steam it's a fun automation Colony building defense game or if you want to learn all about C then check out my complete C course all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
