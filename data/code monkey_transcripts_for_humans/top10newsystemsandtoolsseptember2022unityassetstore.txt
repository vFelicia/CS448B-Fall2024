00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tones and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - September 22. this one is the list of
00:12 - paid systems and tools in the last video
00:14 - I already covered all the best free new
00:15 - assets so go watch that if you haven't
00:17 - seen it as always there's links to the
00:19 - ass in the description and as bonus you
00:20 - can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get
00:22 - 10 off your order also right now there's
00:24 - a sale on the SSR everything by City
00:26 - Studios is currently at half price for
00:28 - me I'm a big fan of their awesome low
00:30 - poly style and there's also some flash
00:32 - deals with a super deep 70 discount so
00:35 - check out the link in the description to
00:36 - see which ones are in a Flash discount
00:38 - right now alright so starting off with a
00:40 - pretty huge release this is Odin
00:42 - validator as you can tell by the name
00:44 - this one is from the same team as the
00:46 - excellent Odin inspector which is
00:48 - actually the dependency for this one but
00:49 - chances are you already own that one
00:51 - this one is all about helping you
00:53 - validate issues in your game it helps
00:55 - you easily find missing references find
00:57 - broken assets materials Shader errors
00:59 - missing scripts broken unit events and
01:01 - tons more you can apply automation hooks
01:04 - to run validation before every run or
01:06 - build you can export validation results
01:08 - to HTML or Json and of course just like
01:11 - without an inspector you can build your
01:13 - own tools on top of this one there's all
01:15 - kinds of attributes you can add to your
01:16 - code to make sure everything works
01:18 - exactly as you intend if you forget
01:20 - something it will help you find the
01:22 - problem and fix it so this one
01:24 - definitely looks like an excellent
01:25 - addition to the already excellent Odin
01:27 - inspector then here's a fun tool a 3D
01:30 - mask like an implies you can add a mask
01:32 - in 3D so you make a quad and change what
01:35 - you can see through that Rod this is one
01:37 - of those things that looks really simple
01:39 - but if you've ever tried doing this
01:41 - yourself then you know how complex it
01:43 - can be there's lots of issues with
01:45 - shaders depth buffers Z ordering and so
01:47 - on so having a simple easy use tool to
01:50 - achieve this effect is definitely very
01:51 - worthwhile you can learn how to add it
01:53 - to your project by just watching a
01:55 - simple 1.5 minute video it's that simple
01:57 - then an interesting tool all about
01:59 - quaternions for me I've been using Unity
02:02 - for 10 years now and I still have
02:04 - trouble with quaternions for the most
02:05 - part I pretty much just completely avoid
02:07 - them so this tool helps to make that
02:09 - easier with one line of code you can
02:11 - rotate the object exactly as you want it
02:13 - now I'm still not exactly sure on
02:16 - exactly what it does after watching the
02:18 - video and reading the description I
02:19 - still don't get it but the promise of
02:21 - easy quaternion certainly has me
02:22 - intrigued up next do you need millions
02:25 - of Blades of grass in your game then
02:27 - check out this tool lightning implies
02:29 - it's GPU based meaning super fast and
02:31 - supports tons of objects this one is a
02:34 - replacement to unt's terrain grass
02:36 - system which is apparently CPU based
02:38 - this one is on the GPU so there are no
02:41 - hitches on changing LEDs you can render
02:43 - on multiple terrains it runs supports
02:45 - wind you can cover the grass and make it
02:47 - blend with the bottom terrain certainly
02:49 - the results in the video definitely
02:51 - speak for themselves then if you want to
02:53 - damage a mesh look at this tool the
02:55 - deformation certainly looks very
02:57 - realistic you can apply to any mesh this
02:59 - would be perfect for any game that
03:01 - features collision damage like for
03:03 - example any car game it works in real
03:05 - time and you can deform and repair with
03:07 - code it's lightweight and performant
03:09 - home with nicely commented threads and
03:12 - speaking of vehicles if you've ever
03:13 - wanted to make a motocross game then
03:15 - look at this one as a kid I remember
03:17 - having tons of fun playing Motocross
03:19 - Madness it was a really fun game where
03:21 - you could drive your bike around and do
03:22 - all kinds of Tricks looking at this
03:25 - asset immediately reminds me of that
03:26 - game it's based on dots using jobs and
03:29 - the burst compiler so it's extremely
03:30 - performant supporting multiple bikes all
03:33 - active at once you have several types of
03:35 - bikes you can simulate you've got a
03:37 - regular dirt bike adventure bike quad
03:39 - bike and so on you can customize the ik
03:42 - on the human driver meaning most of the
03:44 - animations are dynamically driven by ik
03:47 - and of course you can customize the
03:48 - character itself and one more phone
03:50 - bonus feature is it has a POV camera
03:53 - designed by using a GoPro camera in real
03:55 - life
03:55 - so it definitely makes it look really
03:57 - interesting then here's a very
03:59 - professional tool for super low latency
04:01 - streaming that is usually the main
04:03 - problem with tools that do on live video
04:05 - this one is meant for you to show
04:07 - real-time gameplay as fast as possible
04:09 - for example you can see what someone is
04:11 - seeing through their Hollands you can
04:13 - share virtual reality with friends
04:15 - collaborate in real time and a bunch
04:17 - more the main thing is stability and
04:19 - performance then for a UI tool with some
04:22 - strange but interesting effects you can
04:24 - make some UI elements merge into one
04:26 - another you can make them dissolve into
04:28 - different shapes and some other weird
04:30 - effects it's all based on regular UI
04:32 - objects and text mesh Pro
04:34 - definitely a strange thing but it
04:36 - certainly makes your UI look very unique
04:38 - up next if you're working on a retro and
04:40 - low poly game then look at this low poly
04:43 - terrain editor you can place and rotate
04:45 - textures automatically place some detail
04:47 - and import the height map you can make
04:49 - automatic texturing based on terrain
04:51 - height and being low poly means you can
04:53 - pick up each individual vertex and
04:55 - terrain and make some brilliant low poly
04:57 - shapes then if you need a way to record
04:59 - audio in the game here's a simple tool
05:01 - it does exactly what you expect so you
05:03 - can record audio in a multitude of
05:05 - formats you can grab it from whatever
05:07 - audio Source the player has then perhaps
05:10 - you can use that audio and let the
05:12 - player add it to their own gameplay
05:13 - Clips or maybe use it to send a
05:15 - voicemail to some friends in game or
05:17 - perhaps combine it with some kind of
05:18 - cloud machine learning to add voice
05:20 - controls to your game alright so those
05:22 - are my top 10 new tools and systems on
05:24 - the unity assesor for September 22.
05:26 - there's links on the description and as
05:28 - a bonus you can use the coupon code
05:29 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your organ and
05:31 - also check out my own free and paid as
05:33 - on store all right hope that's useful
05:35 - check out these videos to learn some
05:37 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
05:39 - supporters for making these videos
05:40 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
05:42 - see you next time
05:48 - [Music]
