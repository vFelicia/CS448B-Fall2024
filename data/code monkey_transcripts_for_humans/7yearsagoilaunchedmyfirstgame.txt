00:05 - bundle at unity code monkey comm slash
00:08 - game bong in this video I'm going to
00:10 - tell the story about the time that I
00:12 - launched my very first PC game seven
00:14 - years ago
00:14 - the game was survivors Quan which was a
00:16 - strategy action game that still to this
00:18 - day I think it's mechanically very
00:20 - interesting I'm telling my story in the
00:22 - hopes of inspiring you by showing how we
00:23 - all start from nothing let's begin so
00:31 - all the way back in 2012 was when I
00:33 - finally decided that I want to make a
00:35 - complete desktop PC game I covered in my
00:38 - entire game that journey in another
00:39 - video and if you've seen that video then
00:41 - you know that was the point that I
00:42 - transitioned away from flash and into PC
00:45 - game development in December of 2012 I
00:47 - started looking at how I could possibly
00:49 - make a PC game which is how I eventually
00:51 - came upon unity for design I wanted
00:54 - something that was mouse heavy so I was
00:56 - looking for a design that really made
00:57 - use of the PC as a platform and that
01:00 - design eventually ended up becoming
01:01 - survivors but still to this day I think
01:04 - it's a really cool game with some really
01:06 - interesting mechanics it's definitely
01:07 - not very polished and very clunky at
01:09 - times which clearly shows that it was my
01:11 - very first game but mechanically
01:13 - speaking I think it still holds up today
01:15 - especially the sequence survivors for
01:17 - gun points which features the same base
01:19 - mechanics with a ton more polish so I
01:21 - start working on what eventually became
01:23 - survivor squad all the way back in
01:25 - December of 2012 and six months later in
01:28 - May of 2013 was when it finally came out
01:31 - so that was a really interesting time I
01:33 - was really pleased with what I built I
01:35 - learned a ton and I finally had made a
01:37 - complete proper PC game I've played it
01:40 - in full screen and it worked exactly as
01:41 - I imagined so in that sense I was
01:43 - definitely feeling very good about it
01:45 - especially in retrospect since now I
01:47 - know that about 90% of people who start
01:49 - making games never actually finish them
01:51 - so the fact that I started in completely
01:53 - game over the course of six months was
01:55 - definitely a great thing however in
01:57 - order for it become a job it also needed
01:59 - to make money and well that's where the
02:01 - problems came in now back then Steam
02:03 - already had greenlight it was actually
02:05 - announced about one year earlier and the
02:07 - announcement of greenlight is one of the
02:09 - main things that first planted the seed
02:10 - in my head that I could make a PC game
02:13 - before greenlight essentially you need
02:15 - to know someone so for me as a random
02:17 - kid and living in Portugal obviously I
02:19 - didn't have any connections and didn't
02:20 - know anyone in the games industry
02:22 - so before greenlight the idea of being
02:24 - an indie game developer was simply not
02:26 - possible at all
02:27 - however greenlight did happen and with
02:29 - it came the possibility of making PC
02:31 - games and making a living so when I
02:34 - first announced the game I quickly
02:35 - submitted it to greenlight I wrote on
02:37 - the text made the page made some cool
02:39 - gifs and so on
02:40 - I remember the response was free good
02:42 - the game was decent back then and people
02:45 - seem to really like the concept behind
02:46 - it however back then the queue to get
02:48 - through green light was still huge you
02:50 - needed thousands upon thousands of votes
02:52 - in order to move up the list and finally
02:54 - get accepted again with me being just a
02:56 - random kid with no connections and no
02:58 - concept of marketing I couldn't really
03:00 - get that many votes
03:01 - so when May came and my design was
03:03 - complete and I felt the game was ready
03:04 - for release I hadn't been accepted yet
03:06 - so I did what every other small indie
03:09 - developer did back then which was to
03:11 - simply release it on my own website now
03:14 - thankfully back then Humble Bundle
03:15 - already existed with their extremely
03:17 - useful humble widget without that it
03:19 - would have definitely been a pain to
03:20 - handle all of the payments distributing
03:22 - the game files but thankfully through
03:24 - that widget it was very easy so i
03:26 - polished up the website made a trailer
03:28 - and released the game and well you can
03:31 - probably guess what happens when an
03:32 - unknown game from a first-time unknown
03:34 - in the developer in a tiny country
03:36 - launches a game the answer is well
03:38 - pretty close to zero sales I think on
03:40 - the first day it sold something like
03:42 - five copies and then on the second day
03:43 - your whopping twenty copies and then
03:45 - back down to ten and then three and so
03:47 - on so very quickly it dropped down to
03:49 - zero now like I said that was a really
03:52 - interesting time so I was really happy
03:54 - to have made a complete proper PC game
03:56 - examine like I wanted but the end result
03:59 - of six months of work was something like
04:01 - three hundred bucks so it seemed that
04:03 - despite of my efforts my dream of making
04:05 - it as an indie game developer wasn't
04:07 - really going to happen one interesting
04:10 - thing was how the game did get an
04:12 - article on Rock Paper Shotgun which was
04:14 - really awesome back then when I first
04:16 - started making PC games two of my main
04:18 - dream like calls were to get my game on
04:20 - Rock Paper Shotgun and get it reviewed
04:23 - by totalbiscuit
04:24 - on his WTF his series family that's like
04:27 - girl never came to pass so that's what
04:30 - happened when I watch my game I was
04:32 - happy with what I produced and sad with
04:34 - the financial results for a while that
04:36 - was a pretty dark time I mean back then
04:38 - I had dropped out of college about a
04:40 - year before that so I really didn't see
04:41 - much of a future for me
04:42 - when I first saw green light I saw a
04:45 - possible feature and then when I saw
04:47 - zero copies I saw that possible feature
04:49 - disappear in front of my eyes but then I
04:52 - did see a glimmer of hope and look at my
04:55 - green light page which was getting a
04:56 - slow trickle of upvotes and simply did
04:58 - the math if the votes kept coming in
05:00 - then it was only a matter of time till I
05:02 - had enough to reach the top of the list
05:03 - and be approved and if I got on Steam
05:06 - then I would get a second chance at
05:07 - success once I had that thought my brain
05:10 - clicked and that's when I felt that fire
05:12 - again and that feeling that it was still
05:13 - possible so I went right back to it I
05:16 - was going to improve the game as much as
05:18 - I could in the time that I had so that's
05:20 - what I did over the next five months I
05:22 - fixed a ton of bugs polished a ton of
05:24 - things added more features and improved
05:26 - it as much as I was capable at the time
05:28 - and then it finally happened I got the
05:31 - email that said the game had been
05:32 - approved for only son scene so that's
05:34 - probably the best email I have ever
05:36 - gotten my plan for a second chance was
05:38 - finally coming to fruition one of the
05:40 - more interesting videos I made is the
05:42 - 200 days in greenlight video it's on the
05:45 - analyst web Studios channel linked in
05:46 - the description
05:47 - it shows the graph as I went through
05:49 - green light on with some comments I
05:51 - pretty much took a screenshot every
05:53 - single day and then made that video so
05:55 - it's really cool to see the progression
05:56 - if you want to see how things were back
05:58 - then and definitely give them all so the
06:01 - game was accepted which meant I had
06:02 - access to the same back-end then it was
06:05 - still a ton of work left to do I had to
06:07 - make the complete steam store page I had
06:10 - to learn everything about how steam
06:11 - bells work which was really complex and
06:13 - really confusing that definitely took me
06:16 - several days to finally understand how
06:17 - it works and about my bill and once I
06:20 - appointed it I immediately tested it
06:21 - with my own account watching my game
06:23 - from the steam point that was yet
06:25 - another great moment to see a game that
06:27 - I made going through the steam client I
06:29 - mean I spent most of my childhood
06:30 - playing counter-strike so I remember
06:32 - playing 1.5 and hearing about this new
06:35 - program called steam that was going to
06:36 - be required for future comes track
06:38 - versions so I got steam many years ago
06:40 - right
06:41 - lunch since it was a requirement to play
06:43 - CS 1.6 little did I know that many years
06:46 - later I would have my own game on that
06:48 - little program so getting the bill
06:50 - deployed was really tricky but I managed
06:52 - to do it then I wanted to do the best
06:54 - work possible so I want to add
06:55 - achievements and all these team features
06:57 - so yet another challenging thing
06:59 - figuring out how on earth is these team
07:01 - API work making all the achievement
07:03 - icons writing all the names and
07:04 - description and setting up all the code
07:06 - to trigger the achievements I definitely
07:08 - felt this was my one true chance so I
07:10 - did only could just to make it work and
07:12 - then finally after all this on November
07:15 - 8 2013 the game was launched on scene so
07:18 - in terms of results it actually did
07:20 - surprisingly well back then steam had
07:22 - fewer games coming out every day so a
07:24 - game which looked interesting and had a
07:26 - unique concept did stand-up in that
07:28 - first month on seeing the game sold
07:30 - about $15,000 so in that first month I
07:33 - made more money than I made working on
07:34 - flash for over 5 years and it's
07:36 - obviously several orders of magnitude
07:38 - more than I made when I launched the
07:40 - game on my own website in May now
07:42 - depending on where you live 15,000 might
07:44 - not seem like much but here in Portugal
07:46 - that's pretty much a full-time income so
07:48 - at that point any game development
07:50 - became my official job now if you saw
07:53 - the games out journey video then you
07:54 - know that things didn't go so well after
07:56 - that this is a very volatile business
07:58 - and I've certainly had my ups and downs
08:00 - over the years but still for the time
08:02 - being the game was very successful
08:04 - design wise I'm still very happy with
08:06 - the film review mechanic is still very
08:08 - interesting and unique even today the
08:11 - sequel survivor squad complex is still
08:13 - in my favorite games I'm a despite being
08:15 - a financial failure another really cool
08:17 - video that I made was the game
08:19 - development time lapse it shows the game
08:21 - being built over time starting
08:22 - completely from scratch and going
08:24 - through all the code being written and
08:25 - all the assets being added it's really
08:28 - interesting to see all the mechanics
08:29 - being added all the levels being created
08:31 - the world map being generated the
08:33 - visuals going from temporary
08:34 - placeholders to the best that I can make
08:36 - the time so yeah really interesting to
08:38 - see it all come together it's such a
08:39 - long a long time we go check out the
08:42 - full video linked in description now
08:43 - that was seven years ago which honestly
08:46 - feels like a lifetime ago
08:47 - since then I have published seven more
08:49 - games wrote something like a million
08:51 - lines of code learned a ton about game
08:53 - design
08:54 - and marketing and I made this channel
08:56 - with now over 300 videos sharing what
08:59 - I've learned over all that time so
09:01 - that's the story of how I made my very
09:03 - first PC game
09:04 - I covered my whole game that journey in
09:07 - another video that one covers how I
09:08 - started making IRC games back when I was
09:10 - 10 years old then eventually found flash
09:13 - and finally seven years ago I got onto
09:15 - unity and made my very first PC game if
09:18 - you haven't seen it yet then definitely
09:19 - check it out that video took a long time
09:21 - to make but I'm really happy with how it
09:23 - ended up alright so I hope my story has
09:26 - inspired you and provided with some more
09:28 - detail as to what any game development
09:30 - is relevant like and my message to you
09:32 - wherever you are in your journey is to
09:34 - keep it up and keep making games we all
09:37 - start from nothing but if you persevere
09:38 - I am sure you too can grow and find your
09:40 - success check out the code monkey app on
09:43 - steam interactive tutorials complete

Cleaned transcript:

this video is made possible by my game bomber play seven awesome games and help support the channel get the steam game bundle at unity code monkey comm slash game bong in this video I'm going to tell the story about the time that I launched my very first PC game seven years ago the game was survivors Quan which was a strategy action game that still to this day I think it's mechanically very interesting I'm telling my story in the hopes of inspiring you by showing how we all start from nothing let's begin so all the way back in 2012 was when I finally decided that I want to make a complete desktop PC game I covered in my entire game that journey in another video and if you've seen that video then you know that was the point that I transitioned away from flash and into PC game development in December of 2012 I started looking at how I could possibly make a PC game which is how I eventually came upon unity for design I wanted something that was mouse heavy so I was looking for a design that really made use of the PC as a platform and that design eventually ended up becoming survivors but still to this day I think it's a really cool game with some really interesting mechanics it's definitely not very polished and very clunky at times which clearly shows that it was my very first game but mechanically speaking I think it still holds up today especially the sequence survivors for gun points which features the same base mechanics with a ton more polish so I start working on what eventually became survivor squad all the way back in December of 2012 and six months later in May of 2013 was when it finally came out so that was a really interesting time I was really pleased with what I built I learned a ton and I finally had made a complete proper PC game I've played it in full screen and it worked exactly as I imagined so in that sense I was definitely feeling very good about it especially in retrospect since now I know that about 90% of people who
