00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI steam
00:03 - just had the October Festival the other
00:04 - day so I asked you which one of your
00:06 - games had Dem was available here I'm
00:08 - going to play through five of your games
00:09 - and give my feedback on both the games
00:11 - themselves in terms of game design
00:12 - usability mechanics and so on and then I
00:14 - will also give feedback on the steam
00:16 - store Pages based on my knowledge of
00:18 - steam game marketing by the way there
00:19 - were actually more than five games
00:20 - submitted so thank you so much for that
00:22 - initially I wanted to go through all of
00:24 - them but this video is already insanely
00:25 - long with just five games this took ages
00:27 - to edit so I really had to limit it to
00:29 - just five there are time stamps in the
00:31 - description for each of the games and I
00:32 - also made a page on the website with
00:34 - links to all the games so you can go
00:35 - play demos for yourself and add them to
00:37 - your wish list now if you enjoy this
00:39 - video go ahead and hit the like button
00:40 - and subscribe if people find this format
00:42 - useful then I'll keep doing it every
00:43 - time there's a steam Festival the next
00:45 - one is actually going to happen in
00:46 - February so if you didn't make it in
00:48 - time for this one then maybe get ready
00:49 - for that one so next up let's look Aton
00:52 - Trooper so Eon Trooper is a thrilling
00:55 - adventure where strategy action and
00:56 - player choice are at the heart of each
00:58 - Mission delve into an territories
01:00 - execute crucial missions and choose
01:02 - between stealth strategy and direct
01:05 - combat to achieve your objectives okay
01:07 - that's a nice a nice little short
01:09 - description I like it nice short into
01:10 - the point and looking at the screenshot
01:12 - it's kind of like a top down shooter
01:15 - sort of thing okay so let's give this a
01:17 - try okay so I quite like the music on
01:20 - the main menu sounds really good okay
01:22 - let's begin with the tutorial all right
01:24 - movement WD of course grenade use stun
01:28 - grenade that's fun Crouch and roll then
01:32 - shoot knife Power Attack and of course
01:35 - supports controller as well but since
01:37 - I'm guessing this a shooter I prefer to
01:38 - use the mouse okay so let's see every
01:40 - time you eliminate an enemy with your
01:42 - knife you can get ammunition or bandages
01:44 - plus your special attack W be charged
01:46 - okay right away I like that mechanic
01:48 - sort of like Doom forcing you to engage
01:50 - in close combat so that's nice when
01:52 - ready to use aim and Destroy multiple
01:54 - enemies in one hit all right okay so
01:57 - that sounds good let's see right away I
01:59 - really like the art it's like some
02:01 - Vector art and it looks really nice
02:04 - really good okay so apparently we make
02:06 - some sound there are some nice music is
02:10 - great everything is looking really good
02:12 - so far can I interact with this thing I
02:14 - already forgot about the controls yeah I
02:17 - definitely have memory issues uh okay so
02:19 - on Q throws a grenade then on R I assume
02:23 - I have limits yeah I assume that's a two
02:24 - and five so an r that throws a sun
02:27 - grenade and didn't an e do something I
02:29 - thought it did something okay so maybe
02:32 - it's the interact how do I pick it up I
02:34 - guess I don't
02:36 - because oh crap I hit on N to reload and
02:40 - I threw another Sun grenade okay yeah I
02:42 - think that's going to be a bit tricky to
02:45 - to handle that uh muscle memory of
02:47 - always hitting
02:49 - R oh so I got a maximum
02:52 - range all
02:54 - right and he dropped some kind of
02:57 - gun okay I'm not seeing any stats so I
02:59 - don't know if this one is better or not
03:02 - okay so the bullets are moving at an
03:05 - interesting speed they're somewhat slow
03:08 - but they are perfect for being able to
03:10 - dodge so that's actually really good
03:12 - okay do I need any how do I pick up the
03:14 - health okay so for the interaction it
03:17 - appears that the interaction is not
03:18 - based on Mouse position rather on the
03:21 - character position okay so I'll have to
03:22 - remember that and again all these
03:24 - weapons it's really nice I always love
03:26 - games where every weapon is dropped
03:28 - every weapon is picked
03:30 - that just fun and do they have different
03:32 - ammo oh they do okay so I guess I should
03:35 - probably stick with my pistol which was
03:37 - somewhere behind this rock but I can't
03:40 - find it again okay so this one has 35
03:42 - let's see and there was oh right on
03:44 - shift I can Crouch ah so I can
03:47 - essentially and can I throw a grenade
03:49 - over top this nope okay so that doesn't
03:52 - work although the sound is a bit strange
03:55 - because it says the range is like this
03:57 - but apparently they can hear me from
03:59 - quite a bit from F what oh yeah right
04:01 - totally forgot to use the melee and the
04:03 - power okay can I maybe try to sneak
04:07 - behind this guy I'm try to knife him oh
04:11 - nice all right so I think I got a little
04:13 - bit of power oh got something looks like
04:15 - a SMG and I got 150 throw grenade ah all
04:21 - right that was a nice uh radius I don't
04:24 - need any more Health right now I don't
04:27 - know what are these things well I'm
04:29 - assuming the objective disable defense
04:32 - lasers and sabotage the enemy ship okay
04:35 - that sounds good I wasn't there oh right
04:37 - I got a Dodge roll in space so I got to
04:39 - use that as well oh boy okay I went a
04:42 - little bit way too much let's hope this
04:44 - one has some health okay I think I
04:47 - prefer the more impactful shots of the
04:49 - other one I assume it's more impactful
04:52 - would be nice to be able to see the max
04:53 - range so like as I move the cursor past
04:56 - the maximum range I think the cursor
04:58 - should probably go rather or something
04:59 - like that or maybe I was wrong about the
05:01 - max range no cuz yeah if I aim there it
05:04 - doesn't get it there so it would be nice
05:07 - to be able to have visually see okay is
05:09 - that guy in range or not and when these
05:11 - games something that I always really
05:12 - like that always feels really good which
05:15 - I did add and cuz I made a bunch of top
05:17 - down Shooters back in my flash days I've
05:19 - never made a steam game like it but yeah
05:20 - back in the flash days I did and uh yeah
05:23 - basically just making the camera look a
05:25 - little bit towards where the where the
05:28 - player is aiming so basic if I'm aiming
05:30 - to the right side of the camera instead
05:31 - of pointing right down the mdal it
05:32 - should be pointing a little bit to the
05:33 - side that makes the game feel quite a
05:35 - bit more Dynamic so personally if I were
05:37 - developing this game that's one of the
05:39 - things that I would add it makes the
05:40 - camera move quite a bit more and also
05:42 - allows the player to see a little bit
05:43 - further so that's fun o nice one shot
05:47 - does this have head shots or something
05:50 - so I think they weren't being one shot a
05:51 - while ago yeah being able to see guys
05:56 - underneath it's a bit tricky I seee
05:59 - assume that if I touch that I'm going to
06:01 - die so I don't want to touch them I
06:03 - still haven't figured out what are these
06:04 - things maybe that's respawn points I
06:07 - really like a weapon that one shots
06:08 - enemies just one shot although I haven't
06:11 - really used the the uh melee
06:15 - thing I guess I should Dodge yeah but
06:19 - like that I take quite a bit of damage
06:20 - so actually shooting from distance and
06:23 - what are these things I have no
06:25 - idea more crates there got some ammo
06:30 - let me use the oh crap oh
06:33 - crap yeah I wasn't I wasn't expecting
06:36 - that like I tried to use the power but I
06:39 - but I wasn't I didn't know what to
06:41 - expect so I didn't know what was going
06:42 - to happen and yeah that kind of messed
06:44 - me up so I would say for that one I
06:46 - would probably like to see that mechanic
06:48 - and try out that mechanic in a safe
06:50 - space so on some kind of tutorial level
06:53 - just go so that I know what to expect so
06:55 - that this doesn't happen where I basally
06:57 - die just because I had no idea what to
06:58 - expect and all of a sudden and
06:59 - everything went into slow motion I just
07:01 - died instantly okay so do I start
07:04 - everything from
07:05 - scratch would be nice to have a little
07:08 - checkpoint but okay okay so now I got so
07:12 - apparently the star weapon is like the
07:14 - worst one like it has no range so on
07:17 - this one with much shorter range yeah
07:19 - definitely would be very
07:21 - beneficial to being able to see just how
07:25 - far I can shoot so yeah so I much prefer
07:28 - the bigger weapon just just shoots
07:30 - once and just kills them in one shot ah
07:34 - it's really difficult I I don't know
07:36 - what am I oh boy oh boy way too many I
07:40 - don't know how I'm supposed to do melee
07:42 - with them since it is really difficult
07:45 - to do it without getting hit also just a
07:48 - minor polishing thing ah crap a lot of
07:52 - hit boxes uh minor polishing thing would
07:54 - be down here on the health bar make it a
07:56 - little bit more animated so like when I
07:58 - get hit uh the red part should go down
08:00 - but then there should be some kind of
08:02 - white part that only goes down a little
08:03 - bit afterwards in order to demonstrate
08:06 - just how much health that I actually
08:07 - lose with that one shot cuz right now I
08:09 - think I land like five shots but I'm not
08:11 - 100% sure okay let me yeah it would be
08:14 - really nice if the interaction was based
08:16 - on the mouse position cuz yeah oh Bo
08:20 - picking that one up is really tricky
08:22 - yeah really not sure how the I get the
08:25 - idea behind the melee and I like it but
08:28 - it really needs some sort mechanics so
08:29 - that I can safely be able to melee all
08:34 - these enemies without taking tons of
08:35 - damage
08:39 - myself maybe I'm supposed to do
08:41 - something like that just do a Dodge roll
08:44 - really close them okay so maybe that's
08:47 - what I'm supposed to do all right that
08:50 - actually feels good so once again that
08:51 - is something that I would include in
08:52 - some sort of tutorial level teach that
08:55 - mechanic because yeah it does seem like
08:57 - that's what I'm supposed to do instead
08:58 - of just of just moving like that okay
09:01 - okay let me actually pick up a bunch of
09:03 - them just two of them can't I get
09:10 - more boom that was nice should have a
09:13 - few more effects but yeah I like the
09:15 - unlike the mechanic oh and only now I
09:18 - noticed that apparently
09:19 - there's oh
09:21 - crap all right so I guess I got to take
09:23 - this quite a bit slower okay so let's do
09:27 - it slowly now pick up the SMG
09:31 - oh this actually oh did the weapon
09:33 - change oh that's nice I like it all
09:37 - right I really like the the particle oh
09:39 - boy oh boy I put up way too
09:46 - many a all right that was fun but
09:50 - definitely way too intense okay let's
09:51 - try again yeah now I got an SMG yeah the
09:54 - shotgun was much better I would say
09:57 - visually the weapons probably need to be
09:58 - a bit more different cuz I mean I swear
10:00 - the shotgun looked exactly like that one
10:02 - yeah so basically I really I cannot
10:04 - aggro tons of guys at the same time if I
10:07 - do then I can't really also since
10:09 - there's a field of view
10:11 - mechanic that field of view should
10:14 - probably be shown to the player so like
10:18 - that guy gets okay maybe there isn't a
10:20 - field of view maybe just based on
10:22 - distance from the screen okay so
10:24 - basically I was going to say that if it
10:26 - is based on field of view like I can't
10:27 - see him behind that then the area behind
10:30 - that that should probably be a little
10:31 - bit darker but if it's just on the edge
10:33 - of the screen then I guess yeah just
10:35 - fading in although that's a bit strange
10:37 - if it is just on the edge of the screen
10:38 - then I don't think it should fade but
10:41 - okay I guess maybe I'm also supposed to
10:44 - be quite a bit
10:45 - more deliberate with my shots and use
10:49 - stealth quite a bit more oh boy nice I
10:53 - don't know what are these things and I
10:55 - haven't really been using my grenades so
10:58 - I would say for that that I would
10:59 - probably add some sort of timer in the
11:01 - code and if the player has grenades but
11:03 - they haven't used them in quite a while
11:05 - definitely flash it in some way
11:07 - something like that okay let me let me
11:09 - try to actually complete the objectives
11:12 - I would like to have a little special
11:15 - thing nice what is the max four all
11:19 - right that was cool nice can I shoot
11:22 - through the laser no apparently oh I can
11:24 - I just hit the it seems like the hit box
11:28 - yeah the hit box seems a little bit too
11:30 - big usually you want to have the actual
11:32 - hitbox quite a bit smaller than the
11:34 - actual object so the hitbox should be
11:37 - some like 20% smaller than the actual
11:39 - visual object that always makes the game
11:41 - feel quite a bit satisfying it's a small
11:43 - thing but it does matter quite a bit
11:46 - there was a guy there that disappeared
11:48 - and appeared so maybe there is a field
11:50 - of view fog of War sort of effect oh boy
11:55 - how many guys are there on this
11:57 - map
11:59 - nice I got to say when I manage to slide
12:02 - and slash them that feels really
12:04 - satisfying so that should definitely be
12:06 - encouraged just got to oh boy oh boy oh
12:09 - boy oh boy oh boy oh okay I really like
12:14 - the sniper the other weapons are fun but
12:16 - yeah the sniper is just and does it have
12:19 - invisibility frames I actually didn't
12:21 - check yet ah I got hit ah I always get
12:25 - hit they really need some sort of
12:28 - mechanic to make it a bit easier to to
12:31 - get within melee range without ah cuz
12:35 - yeah like that oh crap I need oh crap I
12:37 - can't figure it out okay so how do I
12:39 - actually get inside there okay I got to
12:42 - shoot that I assume am I shooting the
12:44 - right thing there are no I mean cuz yeah
12:48 - there are no health bars so I have no
12:51 - idea can I go through the laser I'm
12:53 - assuming I can't and I really don't want
12:55 - to die trying out if I throw a grenade
12:58 - then nope doeses not get anywhere that
13:00 - far okay so I really don't know what the
13:02 - game wants me to do there I mean if the
13:04 - game had checkpoints if I were to die
13:06 - and I'd spawn there then I would com uh
13:09 - I would feel confident in trying out to
13:11 - see if this kills me but without
13:13 - checkpoints knowing that if I die I'm
13:16 - going to have to do the whole thing that
13:18 - makes it quite a bit trickier ah I
13:21 - missed grenade boom I still haven't
13:24 - tried out the oh crap haven't tried out
13:28 - the
13:29 - stun grenade yeah I guess just stuns
13:32 - them makes sense okay so maybe oh
13:36 - boy maybe I was right and not not trying
13:40 - to not trying
13:42 - to I don't know oh okay I got interact
13:45 - with it nice okay so I think I was right
13:48 - and not trying to lower the defenses
13:52 - okay all right let's try this one ah
13:55 - crap the range is terrible I like to
13:57 - shoot them from a distance
13:59 - oh I Mur grenades all right throw that
14:02 - one just mow them all
14:05 - down a
14:07 - crap oh crap a fire of the grenade
14:11 - accidentally am I out of ammo or am I
14:14 - stunned why can't I
14:16 - shoot okay I don't know what happened
14:18 - but I can't
14:20 - shoot why can't I shoot okay I don't
14:23 - know what happened but that weapon
14:24 - stopped working so can I now take this
14:27 - out run away oh boy extraction Zone okay
14:31 - let's go get out this the extraction oh
14:35 - crap I got to survive for 20 second oh
14:36 - boy it's going to be tricky I really
14:38 - wish the game would give me a few
14:40 - grenades right now oh boy yeah I'm
14:43 - pretty sure I'm not going to make it oh
14:46 - come
14:46 - on a oh
14:49 - boy all right yeah that was definitely
14:53 - definitely tricky yeah I really wish the
14:56 - game had given me a few more Health
14:58 - backs somewhere maybe a grenade or two
15:00 - cuz boy that was quite intense yeah say
15:03 - I definitely enjoyed that game so that
15:04 - was definitely quite fun so let's now
15:06 - look at the store page so I think the
15:08 - capsule is really nice nice and spooky
15:10 - nice icon nice logo so the capsule is
15:13 - really good I think the the uh short
15:15 - description over here is also pretty
15:17 - nice I think after playing it my only
15:19 - concern is I don't know how well the
15:20 - seam audience reacts to basically top
15:22 - down shooter but looking at the
15:24 - screenshots there's quite a bit of
15:25 - content so I think if it has quite a bit
15:29 - more abilities I still haven't figured
15:30 - out what those tiny things were supposed
15:32 - to do but anyways so with a bunch more
15:34 - abilities a bunch more weapons a bunch
15:35 - more enemy types more skills things like
15:38 - that maybe it could work again I really
15:40 - don't know cuz top down Shooters they're
15:42 - not quite uh very popular on Steam
15:45 - nowadays I don't know if that's because
15:46 - there aren't too many or because they
15:48 - don't tend to do well I'm not sure about
15:50 - that and yep as always got to check do
15:52 - you have gifts on the store Page I have
15:54 - no idea why this first one isn't
15:55 - animated but yeah all these nice gifts
15:59 - cuz I do think that the shooting Works
16:01 - quite well the sound design is quite
16:02 - good so yeah in general looks like a
16:04 - very wellmade game so I hope it does
16:06 - well let's go and add it to your wish
16:08 - list okay so next up we have TV's the
16:10 - Revival so TV's the Revival is a
16:13 - platformer single player game that
16:14 - balances exciting action with
16:16 - challenging puzzles when the hero U
16:18 - awakens from a coma he is driven through
16:20 - strange events living in the TV's real
16:22 - world to unravel the mysteries of his
16:24 - past and defeat evil forces plaguing the
16:27 - region by the way there's a of type over
16:29 - there on Plague but y a nice short
16:31 - description so basically this is a
16:33 - platformer single player game okay so
16:35 - let's try this okay my mouse is gone so
16:37 - I assume yeah this is like okay I assume
16:41 - this works with a controller okay so
16:44 - looking at the controls so I've got move
16:46 - jump Crouch roll and interact okay all
16:51 - right so let's go new
16:56 - game okay so apparently the story TVs
16:59 - are fighting one another and then
17:00 - something happened okay so right away in
17:03 - terms of visuals I quite like it
17:05 - obviously got some excellent use of
17:07 - lighting some excellent use of
17:08 - volumetric lighting volumetric fog so in
17:11 - terms of visuals right with looks really
17:12 - nice okay so this is a 2 and a half de
17:15 - platformer so I can only move left and
17:16 - right well that looks really bright okay
17:19 - so far so good and the reflections on
17:21 - the floor oh really nice yeah visually
17:24 - speaking right way it looks
17:27 - great oh boy okay I assume that's not
17:31 - intentional so I got stuck somewhere so
17:33 - I got the Crouch and why was a Dodge
17:36 - roll and then I've got an interact
17:48 - okay all right so the camera there it
17:51 - has no Cuts that's nice I like it looks
17:53 - good so far in terms of level design
17:55 - everything looks really nice and varying
17:56 - can I interact with this oh I can put
18:07 - questions why is the TV pointing
18:09 - straight
18:10 - down okay wow in terms of variety of
18:13 - environments quite a bit everything
18:15 - looks really
18:19 - nice oh boy okay okay all right well
18:22 - there you go okay so I apparently have
18:25 - to dodge the cameras so how do I dodge
18:28 - that if I can't jump above it can I just
18:32 - go slow nope or I guess maybe I am
18:35 - supposed to speed through it that sounds
18:37 - a little
18:39 - counterintuitive because I just got
18:41 - interact I can't interact with anything
18:42 - so I assume that I just have to speed
18:46 - through it okay yeah that definitely
18:48 - feels a little bit counterintuitive but
18:50 - okay all right I'll keep that in mind oh
18:53 - boy timing elements go on go on Oh I
18:56 - thought oh okay the it's a strange
18:58 - pattern it's got like three or four
19:00 - states okay go go go that one does it
19:03 - only have that
19:04 - one right okay so that looks like one of
19:08 - the bad cameras I can only move left and
19:11 - right so okay I got to get behind that
19:14 - little but why do I have to take this
19:17 - with me I assume I have to take it with
19:18 - me okay go go go okay apparently I don't
19:22 - need to take this with me or maybe I do
19:25 - oh boy I feel like I can just barely
19:27 - make it
19:28 - ah okay good all right then the
19:30 - background looks really nice they're
19:32 - destroying robots destroying
19:34 - TVs that's a bit dark let's go
19:43 - elevator oh so I die based on looking at
19:48 - the sun is that it okay so apparently
19:51 - the sun is bad for
19:53 - TVs okay so this is the sun this is not
19:56 - the sun right let me wait wait for that
19:58 - one to go down go go go come on go down
20:01 - down down all right
20:02 - nice go go go uh do I have to time it oh
20:07 - go go go go
20:09 - go
20:11 - almost oh things that fall down I assume
20:15 - oh there's an extra box here I assume
20:17 - I'm going to need this for something is
20:19 - there like a secret in there or
20:21 - something or I guess not I guess this is
20:23 - the intended thing cuz through here I
20:25 - can't go oh now there are TVs with guns
20:29 - okay so when is that TV going to shoot
20:31 - me do they see me okay so I guess I'm
20:34 - safe here again I really like how the
20:36 - camera moves in just one take I assume
20:38 - this is very very much inspired by limbo
20:41 - and inside and those kinds of games
20:43 - let's go Sprint Sprint Sprint get all
20:45 - the way here and
20:47 - Crouch even though I think I could
20:49 - Sprint through all way through go go go
20:52 - okay so I assume that light is in the
20:54 - background oh is there a way to get up
20:56 - there all right guess that's where I
20:59 - need to go right yeah I'm going to guess
21:02 - that I or not or maybe yes oh wa yeah I
21:06 - guess there's no way to go through right
21:08 - cuz that guy is I assume he's going to
21:10 - one shot me go go Sprint Sprint go nope
21:15 - all right that was fun okay so I'm
21:17 - really going to need to pick up a box or
21:21 - do I need to carry two boxes can I just
21:24 - jump on this one no it's not doesn't
21:27 - yeah does pick up okay so I thought I
21:29 - need to push it all the way back but
21:32 - apparently not okay yeah visually
21:33 - speaking the gamees looks really great
21:35 - it has a really nice use of lighting fog
21:38 - all kinds of effects all of them looks
21:40 - really nice okay so I need to get this
21:43 - box down there yeah I don't think that I
21:46 - can get through that guy so can I pick
21:49 - it up all right okay so there's a patrol
21:52 - guy there okay got to wait quite a bit
21:55 - for him to come through and go away okay
21:58 - jump and let's go run run run keep going
22:02 - oh how do how do I push
22:05 - this okay so I I grabed the holes okay
22:09 - go down nice right so I got to wait for
22:12 - the
22:13 - platform would be nice if the right
22:15 - stick allowed me to look a little bit
22:17 - ahead CU right now basically just
22:19 - waiting for the platform to come back
22:22 - all right okay the camera is shaking why
22:25 - is the camera shaking what am I
22:26 - controlling just a second one so do I
22:29 - have to stop him what does stopping do I
22:33 - don't know but I assume that I have to
22:35 - get onto this one and then jump out to
22:38 - that one then the next one but I don't
22:41 - see the next one go go go okay now
22:45 - what yeah I think now I'm screwed
22:49 - because I assume the other one is going
22:51 - to stop at that
22:52 - point let's see if it does okay yeah so
22:56 - that one stopped at that point so so how
22:59 - am I supposed to I'm pretty sure there's
23:02 - nowhere that I can go is there okay so I
23:05 - really don't know cuz I need to be sort
23:07 - of position it in the middle but I'm
23:10 - pretty sure I can't make that jump can I
23:14 - I'm pretty sure I cannot make this jump
23:16 - nope not even close Okay so honestly I'm
23:20 - quite a bit confused I'm not sure what
23:21 - am I supposed to do because this one
23:24 - just keeps that one moving our stop it
23:28 - yeah it just gets to that one oh I think
23:30 - it's timing thing okay so I need to get
23:35 - like super close to this one so I think
23:37 - like this one might actually work okay
23:40 - this is quite a tricky thing stop it a
23:44 - little
23:45 - bit okay is that going to be enough or
23:47 - is it going to get there too fast yeah
23:49 - it's going to get there too fast right
23:51 - come on move
23:53 - faster no yeah now it's moving the other
23:56 - direction I can't get it nope right so I
23:58 - got to say the puzzle definitely
23:59 - increased quite massively in terms of
24:02 - difficulty okay so I got to stop this
24:04 - one here I'm going to wait pretty much
24:07 - until the last possible moment all right
24:09 - so like
24:10 - this oh crap is it going to be two
24:15 - prob oh it is isn't it yeah I can't make
24:18 - that jump nope so I got to like wait
24:22 - pretty much yeah cuz they have the same
24:24 - speed so pretty
24:26 - much yeah cuz then I also needed to be
24:29 - super close to oh come
24:31 - on I also needed to be super close to
24:34 - the other guy so I guess I need to use
24:36 - that one primarily for timing yeah it
24:39 - needs to be close enough for me to jump
24:41 - on the other
24:42 - guy and hopefully that won't be close
24:45 - enough for this one as well right come
24:47 - on can I make the jump I can all right
24:51 - now can I make the second jump on
24:54 - where's the other one okay I'm in all
24:57 - right
24:58 - well that was
25:00 - tricky game was being super easy no
25:02 - puzzle no nothing and all of a sudden
25:04 - became really tricky all right let's go
25:07 - nice let's call in the elevator can I
25:10 - call in the elevator okay so I can do
25:13 - something up here and something down
25:15 - there okay so I got to drop the box over
25:18 - there let's first grab the elevator up
25:21 - there okay so I got to
25:25 - basically it's pushing me
25:28 - no uh well actually it doesn't matter
25:30 - yeah I can just the box is quite a bit
25:33 - floaty definitely should fall down with
25:36 - a bit more of a thunk but yeah all right
25:40 - next one nice I guess right now if
25:42 - anything the only thing is doesn't feel
25:44 - like it has much of a progression
25:46 - although to be fair I'm not the target
25:47 - audience for these kinds of games you
25:49 - know kind of like limbo inside very
25:51 - story Focus or supposedly story Focus uh
25:54 - platformer games that's usually not the
25:57 - kind of game games that I tend to play
25:58 - so I don't know what players of those
26:00 - games of those genres expect but yeah
26:03 - everything has a really great Vibe but
26:06 - okay I assume that's going to fall down
26:08 - so oh boy that one falls down as well
26:10 - that one as well all right nice see
26:13 - compared to that other to that other one
26:15 - this one is much easier okay is that
26:18 - pushing me it kind of feels like yeah
26:21 - it's just a uning bug yeah okay so how
26:25 - do I do this yeah I would say the the
26:28 - interface over there needs to be a
26:29 - little bit more visible maybe flash
26:32 - lights or something cuz yeah but anyways
26:34 - yep let's go and just roll I really like
26:37 - the roll it's fun oh there's one on the
26:41 - back there I didn't even see it let's go
26:44 - roll TR to that one roll and let's go
26:48 - yeah I totally missed that that first uh
26:50 - controller there right some really nice
26:52 - posters yeah in terms of art it
26:54 - definitely looks unique having a bunch
26:56 - of TV face characters definitely looks
26:59 - quite strange quite unique you got two
27:02 - more controls what does this one do so
27:04 - always rotates that one
27:07 - clockwise oh did I just accidentally get
27:10 - it I think I just accidentally got
27:12 - it okay I mean I'm not a fan of puzzle
27:17 - so yeah I'll take blind luck over skill
27:20 - any day yeah all right that was good
27:23 - okay I guess I made it that was probably
27:26 - supposed to be quite a bit more comp
27:27 - likes but okay all right so we got some
27:31 - lasers okay so I got to
27:33 - jump almost oh crap no don't shoot me oh
27:39 - that's going to be
27:40 - tricky how do I hide from it there's a
27:44 - oh God I don't want to risk it yeah I
27:46 - could probably have risked
27:50 - it a how do I get oh I can Crouch under
27:53 - I
27:54 - suppose so let me just go ah no
27:58 - NOP okay wait go yeah if I roll it
28:03 - doesn't actually okay no I thought I
28:05 - could Crouch but apparently I can't so I
28:09 - don't have any safety from that thing so
28:12 - I got to pretty much just Sprint the
28:13 - hall way through yeah I guess so but if
28:16 - I Sprint I'm going to die oh okay so it
28:18 - doesn't actually hit every shot ah okay
28:22 - so I got to keep moving but can I push
28:25 - this I can't so
28:28 - oh okay once again that was just blind
28:31 - luck I did not expect that I was not
28:33 - actively trying to do that but again
28:36 - I'll take it come on come
28:39 - on oh nope NOP
28:41 - nope okay so come again Dodge it okay go
28:46 - out push push push all right no crap go
28:51 - go
28:52 - go all right
28:54 - nice there's a box there I assume I'm
28:57 - I'm going to need it so I might as well
28:58 - take it with me uhoh red lights Dodge
29:03 - now what okay so I guess it's kind of
29:06 - like a boss fight with stages now
29:08 - they're all out intentionally okay oh
29:12 - boy go go go go all right that's fun
29:16 - that's a fun idea for a boss fight I
29:18 - guess uh okay so now what I assume at
29:21 - some point it's going to disable nope
29:26 - nope okay okay
29:28 - nice do I pass in oh boy how do I dodge
29:32 - this really nice camera motion
29:39 - nice oh did I die instantly a that's
29:43 - annoying yeah cuz I was on the other
29:45 - Edge oh now I got to carry the box with
29:48 - me yeah
29:49 - this this little checkpoint should
29:51 - definitely be quite a bit further ahead
29:54 - okay so Dodge this one okay jump that
29:58 - one now that one is
30:02 - intermittent so turn it on turn it off
30:06 - good and now I got to wait at the corner
30:08 - all right okay so now I know that
30:11 - apparently it's going to damage me if
30:14 - I'm on the left side so I got to be on
30:17 - this
30:18 - side order to run away oh okay that that
30:23 - was a bit abrupt but yeah that was that
30:25 - was definitely nice all right so yeah in
30:27 - terms of style definitely has a style
30:30 - definitely has quite an interesting
30:32 - artistic look I'm not sure about
30:35 - storying about what am I supposed to be
30:37 - doing what what is going on but I'm
30:39 - definitely intrigued with the whole TV
30:41 - aesthetic with weapons and doing so yeah
30:44 - definitely considering how this is genre
30:46 - that lives or dies based on Sal loone
30:47 - then yeah I would say so far looking
30:50 - great so looking at the store Page in
30:53 - terms of the capsule yep it is excellent
30:55 - I think the low is actually a little bit
30:57 - sub part compared to all the excellent
30:59 - artart that the game has logo seems a
31:01 - bit too basic but sure it's a nice
31:03 - capsule so yeah the short description I
31:05 - think it's also pretty decent so it says
31:07 - what the game is so platformer single
31:08 - player so that's nice down here again I
31:11 - really like this image I would only
31:12 - suggest make it an actual animated gift
31:15 - so like make these little units move
31:17 - forward maybe the guy in the background
31:19 - move a little bit maybe the smoke move
31:21 - so I think this would uh it's a really
31:23 - nice image really nice composition but I
31:24 - think it would be better as a GI and
31:27 - that I actually think the boss fight is
31:28 - probably the least impressive part so I
31:30 - would probably take a gift from any of
31:32 - the other parts in in the game but yeah
31:35 - like for example I think this one looks
31:36 - much better than that one that one looks
31:38 - a bit confusing I only know that it's a
31:40 - boss because I played demo without
31:41 - playing the demo I would have no idea
31:44 - what exactly is going on here whereas
31:45 - down here it looks clear that it's an
31:47 - environment so up here I would probably
31:48 - put a gift of the character playing
31:50 - moving around doing something so yeah
31:52 - but some nice gifts visually the game
31:54 - looks great so I think that should be
31:56 - the main selling point and yeah like I
31:58 - said not really my kind of game not
32:00 - really my kind of genre but I really
32:02 - enjoyed my time with it it was nice it
32:04 - was mysterious a spencil and Visually
32:07 - which is a big part of this genre
32:08 - visually definitely wor the game looks
32:10 - quite gorgeous so yeah really nice yeah
32:12 - great job nice so let's go ahead add it
32:14 - to your wish list all right so game
32:16 - number two is overrider so take on a
32:19 - high-speed hoverboarding Adventure
32:21 - through a post-apocalyptic World make
32:23 - tricks craft gadgets and fight robots to
32:25 - stop an AI Onslaught threatening to wipe
32:27 - about the remains of humanity all right
32:29 - so let's give this shot all right so
32:31 - this one seems like a racing driving
32:33 - game so I'm going to be using a
32:34 - controller it's got a nice feedback
32:36 - window so that's always good it opens up
32:38 - a simple Windows Form so that's a super
32:41 - easy way to get some feedback and as
32:43 - always when getting feedback you want to
32:44 - make it as easy as possible for the user
32:46 - so yep just being able to choose between
32:48 - numbers instead of having to write tons
32:49 - of text Yep this is great same thing for
32:51 - the other Buton so wish list yep you
32:53 - should always have this devlogs okay so
32:55 - this is nice and Discord community again
32:57 - if you can do it that's great all right
32:58 - so let's start off okay we got some nice
33:01 - storting first thing that I would say is
33:03 - just add some simple text animation to
33:04 - the text that is one of those things
33:06 - that is super easy to add and that's
33:07 - quite a bit of Polish makes everything
33:09 - look quite a bit better just a simple
33:10 - text writer same thing for the character
33:13 - animations that could easily be polished
33:14 - with just making a handful of frames of
33:16 - Animation literally just moving the
33:17 - mouth and nothing else okay use rotor
33:20 - shift downhill some left
33:21 - trigger okay so left trigger brings me
33:24 - down and I can use momentum to start
33:27 - going oh left bumper all
33:34 - right
33:35 - okay not sure how am I supposed to do
33:38 - tricks do that mean oh boy okay I have
33:41 - no idea how do I actually okay XB okay
33:45 - somehow I get feel like okay so I feel
33:48 - like somehow I jumped off where I wasn't
33:50 - supposed to cuz I have no idea how do I
33:53 - perform tricks all right apparently I
33:55 - performed a trick there okay I would say
33:58 - I'm definitely quite a bit lost I have
34:00 - no idea how do I gain more power more
34:02 - something like perform trick so I'm
34:04 - pressing the right Mouse bumper but it
34:06 - doesn't I don't know how do I perform
34:08 - the actual tricks I don't know if I'm
34:10 - supposed to do something to this battery
34:13 - Rush delivery battery okay so we got
34:15 - some nice inor missions although it's a
34:18 - bit tricky that I still have no idea
34:21 - what the controls are actually like
34:25 - so
34:29 - okay apparently I failed that all right
34:31 - so I really would like to find my way
34:33 - back into the tutorial CU I have no idea
34:36 - what I missed okay so I really have no
34:38 - idea how am I supposed to perform any
34:40 - tricks so really no clue what just
34:43 - happened all right so yeah I think I'm
34:45 - just going to go back to the main menu
34:47 - and try to start a new game okay so
34:49 - let's see if now this time I don't miss
34:52 - where I'm supposed to go sound like went
34:54 - down there use rotar shift down here H
34:57 - okay perform tricks but I have no idea
34:59 - how am I supposed to perform tricks I
35:01 - pressed the left Mouse button and now I
35:03 - just lost okay I really have no idea
35:05 - what exactly I'm missing so am I
35:07 - supposed to go down there or not okay so
35:09 - I fell down here
35:10 - [Music]
35:14 - again okay I just picked up something
35:17 - again I have no idea what it is cu
35:19 - apparently I can't pick it
35:23 - up okay and I just fell down again so
35:26 - I'm going to quit again okay trying out
35:28 - again so let's see if now I can make
35:30 - okay go downhill yes I am going downhill
35:33 - now what perform tricks in the air to
35:36 - charge your end so I
35:52 - press okay so I finally figured it out
35:55 - that I was somehow pressing
35:57 - right bumper instead of left
36:02 - bumper okay so now I'm kind of getting
36:06 - the hang of it oh that's cool so I can
36:09 - destroy
36:10 - it oh and that's how you damage as well
36:13 - do I have health anywhere okay there it
36:14 - is 44 all
36:19 - right got to say it feels a bit strange
36:22 - how I have to hit them head on not sure
36:25 - how I'm supposed to die the bullets did
36:28 - I get them nope all right there you go
36:30 - oh are they respawning am I supposed to
36:33 - damage this no I guess not find destroy
36:35 - two rors I only got 6 hp so I hope it
36:39 - works okay oh god oh boy oh boy oh boy
36:44 - no no no
36:47 - no okay it seems I died I quite like the
36:50 - visuals I think in terms of visual style
36:53 - the game doesn't look quite nice and in
36:55 - terms of the movement mechanics it took
36:57 - me a bit to finally understand them but
37:00 - yep I do think the game plays quite well
37:02 - once you understand how it
37:05 - works although I still haven't quite
37:07 - figured out how exactly am I supposed to
37:10 - not take damage considering how they
37:14 - attack me like this cuz like I can only
37:17 - attack them if I go straight to them I
37:19 - guess I am supposed to just try to dodge
37:22 - them and then attack them I'm not sure
37:24 - where am I supposed to get some health
37:28 - all right cool but yeah the combat does
37:30 - feel nice the attacks feel nice and
37:32 - satisfying I assume that the faster I go
37:35 - the more it damages so hav figured out
37:37 - the the uh the tricks how do I do
37:41 - different tricks is it supposed to be
37:43 - random or is it supposed to have some
37:45 - kind of control because it seems like it
37:46 - doesn't matter which way I'm moving it
37:49 - always seems to do the same thing go one
37:52 - two
37:53 - three and I can hit it oh boy I'm
37:57 - already out of Health again woo let's go
37:59 - down oh boy I really like how inventive
38:02 - the robots
38:06 - are oh boy that's a big
38:10 - one all right nice the world does seem
38:14 - to be quite open quite variant quite
38:16 - vast so that's good I really like the
38:18 - fov everything looks pretty nice some
38:21 - random damage building here oh is that a
38:23 - healing station I could actually use
38:25 - that is it oh it is nice does it have a
38:29 - map nope I think the only issue is since
38:31 - the game is all movement Pace it seems
38:33 - to have way too many flat planes so like
38:36 - over here there's not much where I can
38:38 - have fun and go fast it's all way too
38:41 - flat so I'm not sure like I want to go
38:44 - in that direction it seems like I got to
38:45 - go through a super slow speed maybe the
38:49 - Boost effect maybe that one should
38:51 - reload naturally cuz like this yeah so
38:53 - do I slide down there in order to go in
38:56 - there I'm not sure sure okay so is this
38:57 - where I'm supposed to come I think I was
38:59 - in the middle of making some Mission oh
39:02 - so I got to get the other things let try
39:04 - to get these guys boom I get him oh God
39:10 - almost
39:11 - nothing nice okay I got to go there okay
39:15 - how do I go there but in terms of
39:17 - environment I quite like this world
39:19 - everything looks really nice lots of
39:22 - apocalyptic vegetation stuff like that
39:25 - looks really again how do I get there
39:28 - NOP not here battery Rush challenge nope
39:33 - okay I assume I have to go through
39:39 - here now what oh God okay so I have no
39:43 - idea if I'm even going in the right
39:46 - direction or not I have no idea how I'm
39:48 - supposed to get there okay so I've been
39:50 - playing for about 40 minutes so here's
39:52 - my thoughts basically in terms of the
39:54 - world in terms of the creation of the
39:56 - world itself the visuals everything
39:58 - looks really good I really like it in
40:00 - terms of the movement mechanics they
40:01 - take a little while to understand but
40:03 - after I do it seems to work quite well
40:05 - so that's quite good however in terms of
40:07 - world traversal well it's really great
40:09 - that the world is really big it also
40:10 - makes it really boring how there are so
40:12 - few Hills so there's like very few
40:14 - opportunities for me to actually get any
40:16 - speed and it's very easy to lose the
40:18 - speed then on the tutorial I was also
40:20 - completely confused as to what buttons
40:22 - to click that's definitely my fault
40:24 - since I haven't used a controller in
40:26 - quite some time so I was confusing left
40:28 - bumper with right bumper but still it
40:30 - would be nice to have some extra buttons
40:32 - explaining which one should I be using
40:35 - and in terms of guidance on the world
40:36 - while the world is great it's very huge
40:38 - very varied looks great I really think
40:40 - it should have some actual proper guided
40:42 - waypoints in the middle of the world so
40:44 - that I know where I need to go and I
40:46 - don't know if I'm missing something but
40:48 - I can't actually get to this Waypoint so
40:50 - that's a bit strange so in general looks
40:52 - pretty nice plays pretty nice just needs
40:54 - quite a bit more guidance for the player
40:56 - looking at the store Page the capsule is
40:58 - a bit OD I like the art I do think the
41:00 - art looks good but it doesn't make it
41:01 - super clear that this is some kind of
41:03 - hoverboard and the overrider over there
41:05 - it's a bit hard to read so in general I
41:08 - like the colors but I think it could
41:09 - have a bit better composition to make it
41:11 - a bit more clear what the game is
41:12 - actually about I think it should make it
41:14 - absolutely clear that you play as a
41:16 - hoverboard that is something pretty
41:18 - unique that very few games have so I
41:19 - think that should be one of the main
41:20 - selling points description is great
41:22 - talks about what you do so take on a
41:24 - high-speed hoverboarding Adventure make
41:26 - tricks craft gadgets and so on so I do
41:28 - think that's good screenshots also
41:30 - pretty good they're also quite varied
41:32 - they show quite a lot of the game quite
41:33 - a lot of the world so those are really
41:35 - nice over here having a gift for add to
41:37 - wish list that is really good that is
41:38 - really nice and gifts over here on the
41:40 - entire description really great work so
41:42 - if you like some fast Bas hoverboarding
41:44 - on a nice huge open world with lots of
41:46 - movement action lots of things then go
41:48 - ahead and add this one to your wish list
41:50 - okay so next up we have le with a
41:53 - strange character over there on the a
41:55 - that is always an interesting choice
41:56 - going for weird characters it's always
41:58 - interesting to see how various store
42:00 - Pages handle things like that for
42:02 - example Steam on the actual URL does
42:04 - actually include that a so create your
42:06 - own medieval Kingdom and watch your
42:07 - world come to life in this minimalistic
42:09 - city bunder choose your world size and
42:11 - shape and turn it into a kingdom any
42:13 - ruler would be jealous of sounds
42:15 - interesting so let's see okay welcome to
42:17 - the Le demo find controls by pressing
42:20 - the question mark in the top left and
42:22 - enjoy unlock new tiles by finishing
42:25 - builds and exploring fun and weird ways
42:27 - to build your kingdom okay so this one
42:29 - doesn't even have a main menu just go
42:31 - straight into the game so for a game
42:33 - like this that's great just get started
42:35 - right away let you see the controls so
42:37 - wnd in order to move the camera seems to
42:40 - move a bit slow but okay that works Tab
42:42 - and shift to rotate okay that's good
42:45 - nice and satisfying I really like the
42:46 - sound effect okay great then click to
42:49 - build right click to destroy
42:51 - duplicate change roof colors well that's
42:54 - an interesting feature rotate the
42:56 - building and switch a building okay so
42:58 - this looks like some kind of gate thing
43:00 - so let's put it over here okay what am I
43:02 - selecting okay I'm selecting a house now
43:04 - so let's put a house over there let's
43:06 - put a little Tower there another gate
43:08 - how do I rotate with the r oh and I can
43:11 - switch
43:12 - oh okay so am I supposed to switch
43:15 - buildings automatically or not how do I
43:18 - okay tab to rotate I put some trees some
43:22 - little things there another thing okay
43:25 - so I got a little entrance and behind
43:27 - I've got my nice little kingdom finish
43:31 - build Ah that's a nice
43:33 - animation okay so I've got a large Tower
43:36 - it's a tower but large with a tall
43:37 - pointy roof and a
43:40 - bridge bridge on water and a wallgate I
43:43 - got to say the animations for the text I
43:45 - really like it and all the satisfying
43:47 - sound effect those all sound really good
43:49 - oh so now I restart instead of basically
43:51 - continuing to build on this one okay so
43:52 - let's restart that one okay so now I got
43:55 - a big tower let's put a big tower over
43:57 - here on the corner let's put a thing
43:59 - over there I have no idea what that is
44:01 - some kind of wall with a strange hole
44:05 - okay and put some more things and some
44:08 - more walls and another Tower here and
44:10 - maybe another Tower
44:12 - there can I remove this one I want to
44:15 - put a a little tent in the middle it's
44:18 - actually quite a bit tricky okay there
44:20 - you go tent in the middle and another
44:23 - wall over here okay so this one should
44:27 - be a wall Corner some kind of thing oh I
44:32 - can't find the wall corner is that
44:34 - intended yeah I can't find on this one
44:35 - either oh so are the parts limited cuz I
44:38 - can't find a wall Corner okay so let's
44:41 - put just some trees over
44:43 - here and on the other side also some
44:46 - trees right there you go there's my
44:49 - super cute little tiny thing with two
44:51 - towers okay let's go finish building
44:53 - again the sound effects sound really
44:54 - nice so apparently that did not give me
44:56 - anything so let's see what am I actually
44:58 - supposed to be doing okay and goes to a
45:01 - steam guide I have to say I'm not sure
45:04 - how many players actually enjoy going
45:06 - into an external guide so I would say
45:08 - putting this inside the game is probably
45:09 - for the best so tals are unlock by
45:12 - getting in-game achievements okay so
45:14 - that's actually pretty nice making
45:15 - achievements gives you more tals that's
45:17 - a a nice simple way to do it oh and I
45:19 - can change the tile of the world all
45:21 - right so that's good I actually prefer a
45:23 - bigger world so let's go with five and
45:25 - again if if it is related to
45:26 - achievements would be nice to be able
45:28 - to see the achievements directly in game
45:31 - what is square do oh it makes it square
45:34 - or
45:35 - Circle okay that's good so I can build a
45:38 - bunch more things all right let's put a
45:40 - big
45:41 - one going I put another big one no some
45:45 - trees over there okay a bunch of trees I
45:49 - have no idea what that is supposed to
45:51 - be all right it's a little bit strange
45:54 - how everything is so pixeling but then
45:56 - over here the shadow is like super high
45:58 - resolution compared to the rest so
46:00 - that's a bit of a a strange visual thing
46:02 - but okay so I can place more trees more
46:04 - camps more things so just fill in the
46:07 - whole world with trees and camps what
46:10 - about walls we continue making some
46:12 - walls over here okay I'm definitely not
46:14 - someone who is good at visual things as
46:17 - you can tell it's definitely not the
46:19 - most appealing uh little
46:24 - castle I I have no idea what that is
46:26 - that meant to be like a tiny gate is
46:28 - that it okay that's my nice Castle put a
46:32 - couple more Towers okay lots of trees
46:35 - lots of things
46:36 - behind and basically the bad guys come
46:38 - in front something like that all right
46:40 - so I think that's a
46:42 - that okay apparently that did not make
46:45 - me an achievement so my suggestion would
46:47 - be in the beginning in the first few
46:49 - playthroughs definitely give the player
46:50 - at least something so I got a few new
46:52 - buildings on the first world but then
46:54 - the second and the third I got nothing
46:56 - so it would be nice to have something
46:58 - that guarantees the player always gets a
46:59 - little bit of something or at least
47:01 - maybe some kind of indicator over here
47:03 - talking about the next easiest
47:05 - achievements I think that's the main
47:06 - thing I think the goal with the
47:07 - achievements that is a good idea but it
47:09 - really needs to be shown in game rather
47:11 - than having to go into the Steam
47:12 - Workshop to see that okay so apparently
47:15 - even on the overlay I can't see the
47:16 - achievements so that's odd okay so it
47:18 - appears the game doesn't actually have
47:20 - achievements yet or does it only have
47:22 - these ones okay so let me try to make a
47:25 - five world complete okay make a five
47:27 - world like this and just complete it on
47:30 - everything okay try to make just some
47:32 - massive walls and everything try to
47:34 - finish it did I miss one oh crap I think
47:37 - I missed one okay let me try it again
47:40 - just place a mountain of
47:49 - walls all right okay so that worked a w
47:53 - with stairs easier to access than any of
47:56 - the other ones
47:58 - Cavalry so those are supposed to be
48:00 - horses that kind of looks like a trevet
48:03 - okay so there are a bunch more
48:05 - achievements place a rock on a one toown
48:07 - world although suddenly I have no idea
48:10 - which one is wrong is this A rock on a
48:12 - one town world this is the Cavalry this
48:15 - is some wall okay is this supposed to be
48:18 - Rock I guess it would be nice to have
48:19 - some kind of text saying Which object do
48:21 - I have selected so let's see if this one
48:23 - is a rock nope apparently not not okay
48:26 - maybe I just don't have the rock place a
48:29 - house on a one tile World okay is this
48:31 - the house let's see okay let's see this
48:34 - one a three town world with no Castle
48:37 - objects so a three town world no Castle
48:40 - objects so I have no idea what that is
48:42 - does cly count as a castle object well
48:44 - let's put just some okay does that work
48:47 - all right got some water nice there's a
48:51 - timer counting down demo time I have no
48:53 - idea what happens when that one gets
48:54 - down to zero okay so let's see this one
48:56 - have more Cavalry than houses so on the
48:59 - three town world let's see which one was
49:02 - Cavalry I don't have
49:04 - Cavalry okay so that's a bit strange I
49:08 - still haven't figured out what is the
49:09 - logic behind which blocks do I have
49:11 - available okay so my thoughts the idea
49:14 - is definitely interesting the music is
49:16 - definitely quite chill so I quite like
49:18 - that it does visually look like one of
49:20 - those relaxing games so I think visually
49:22 - in terms of Music everything works quite
49:24 - great the concept of going for the
49:26 - achievements I also like that I think
49:28 - that is pretty good it reminds me of a
49:30 - flash game that I used to love called
49:31 - Achievement Hunter was that the name I
49:33 - think so where you just made thousands
49:35 - of achievements that was a really
49:36 - awesome game so I think this could have
49:39 - a similar satisfying feeling to that one
49:41 - the only thing it needs is obviously
49:43 - some list of achievements directly
49:44 - inside the game as opposed to being on a
49:46 - external guide and also would be nice to
49:48 - be able to see the name of the things
49:49 - that I'm placing and maybe just say a
49:51 - suggestion of what is the next easy
49:53 - achievement that I could achieve but in
49:55 - terms of going for a minimalist super
49:57 - simple relaxing City Builder yep it does
49:59 - seem to be on the right track looking at
50:02 - the store Page I have to say this
50:04 - background works really well in game but
50:06 - over here it looks way too minimalistic
50:09 - I would say overly minimalistic to the
50:12 - point where it looks slow quality even
50:13 - though in the game it actually makes
50:14 - sense it actually works out but over
50:16 - here on the store Page it makes it look
50:18 - a bit worse so maybe the game could
50:20 - feature on like two modes have one mode
50:22 - where the background is kind of like
50:23 - this void where it's just a gradient and
50:25 - have another one where it's an actual
50:27 - physical background I think that would
50:29 - help at least make the screenshots look
50:31 - a bit more inviting same thing for the
50:33 - capsule I do think the title I do think
50:35 - that is really good Andy Castle on the
50:37 - side also looks pretty nice again it's
50:39 - really just a background that seems
50:40 - overly basic the short description is
50:43 - nice short and to the point down here
50:45 - yep we've got some gifts so that's great
50:47 - make your kingdom as small or as big so
50:49 - that's nice I would actually make this
50:51 - first gift start off as just a 1 by one
50:53 - world then expand to an 11 by1 world I
50:56 - think that would be a bit more visually
50:57 - unique and it really well written over
50:59 - here we've got various B points and
51:01 - apparently one of them is frog so I have
51:03 - no idea what that means but okay so you
51:05 - feel like a chill relaxing minimalist
51:07 - City builder then go ahead and add this
51:09 - one to your wish list all right so the
51:11 - first game we're going to look at is
51:12 - called utter takedown so this one is a
51:14 - top- down technical stealth game set in
51:16 - the 2000s you have been a Hitman for a
51:18 - long time but after you stopped working
51:20 - with the local Mafia it decided to
51:21 - kidnap your family to get rid of you now
51:23 - your goal is to make the other Mafia
51:25 - take it out let's try out the demo and
51:26 - then I'll analyze the seam store Page
51:28 - all right so first thing is on the main
51:30 - menu there's a really nice wish list on
51:31 - seam button this is always something to
51:33 - have so that's great Discord is also
51:35 - great if you can manage that community
51:36 - and I also like the road map showing all
51:38 - the kinds of things that are coming up
51:40 - in the final release the buttons they do
51:42 - have some sound effects so that's good
51:44 - but they are super basic buttons they
51:46 - have no impact whatsoever so I would
51:48 - recommend adding some Polish to the
51:49 - buttons so they pop up in some way or at
51:51 - least change in a much more visually
51:53 - significant manner so it could be as
51:54 - simple as just making the text turn
51:56 - black and the background turn white then
51:58 - I'll the logo over here it looks super
52:00 - pixelated which I'm guessing means just
52:02 - forgot to add the MIP Maps if you just
52:04 - enable MIP maps and this should look
52:06 - quite a bit better okay so let's try out
52:08 - the
52:09 - tutorial okay that's a great transition
52:11 - I really like that one video tutorials
52:13 - always a great thing I always enjoy that
52:15 - so let's see okay so w to move all right
52:18 - okay I really like the sound area
52:21 - there's somebody asleep so right away it
52:22 - makes me test if I move closer does
52:24 - anything happen oh okay so I kind of
52:26 - expect there to wake up apparently I can
52:28 - interact so I don't know but anyway
52:30 - great use of the custom cursors this is
52:32 - something that actually not many games
52:34 - use but it's something that always makes
52:35 - your game feel quite a bit more polished
52:37 - if you have a custom cursor as opposed
52:38 - to the default one okay so anyways let's
52:40 - try following the goal so you can run
52:42 - faster with shift and as you run there's
52:44 - more noise okay great I have to say the
52:45 - running doesn't seem like it's much of a
52:48 - difference definitely doesn't seem quite
52:49 - as impactful I would say to make it more
52:52 - impactful to make it run quite a bit
52:53 - faster but then again that would break
52:54 - balance so I don't know if that was a
52:56 - delivered choice but it does look a
52:58 - little bit way too sluggish I would say
53:00 - but let's see if it works with
53:01 - everything else apparently we can
53:03 - interact with some objects all right so
53:05 - apparently it's right click okay so I
53:07 - can pick up a knife and I can pick up
53:09 - okay it would be nice to have a little
53:11 - tool tip to know what this is I assume
53:13 - that's a taser maybe the tutorial will
53:15 - talk about it in the future okay yep
53:17 - pick up items with right Mouse button
53:18 - you should be close enough okay so
53:20 - that's great interacting with other
53:21 - objects just left Mouse button all right
53:23 - you can change the camera angle and open
53:26 - doors with this technique okay so we can
53:28 - open doors by modifying the camera all
53:30 - right that's interesting how exactly do
53:32 - I open doors with that okay that's a bit
53:35 - all right so apparently the camera has a
53:38 - bit of a strange Behavior it looks like
53:41 - it's intentional to not do a 180 so as I
53:43 - press Q it rotates this area now I press
53:45 - Q again and I would expect to rotate the
53:47 - other way but apparently goes back here
53:48 - so that's a little bit confusing but
53:50 - okay I guess I can get used to it okay
53:52 - let's open up doors okay yeah the camera
53:55 - rotation is definitely quite a bit
53:56 - tricky I'm doing 180s when that is not
53:59 - my intention okay no like this yeah all
54:01 - right being able to interact with all
54:03 - that's great in a game like this being
54:05 - able to add these kind of tiny
54:06 - interactions these are always right so
54:08 - I'd recommend also adding an interaction
54:10 - over here with the sinks that would be
54:12 - fun the more interactions you had the
54:14 - more it makes your game feel much more
54:16 - living so that's always great okay so I
54:18 - see a bad guy there and there's no view
54:20 - cone so I'm going to have to guess as to
54:23 - how much can you actually see but I'm
54:24 - also going to have to guess how I'm
54:26 - going to attack him I still haven't
54:28 - figured out how I can use the taser
54:30 - weapon oh boy there's another one okay
54:32 - apparently can't see me all the way back
54:34 - here so for a stealth game I would
54:36 - appreciate if it was easier to be able
54:37 - to see the view cones is this okay no
54:39 - this just shows the interactable objects
54:42 - all right so yeah for attacking I still
54:43 - know do I left click do I right click
54:45 - and that is going to be a bit stressful
54:46 - since this is a stealth game so usually
54:48 - what you want to do in a tutorial like
54:50 - this one is you want it to be able to
54:52 - have the first attack Beyond some kind
54:53 - of dummy some kind of that does not
54:56 - attack you back so I would suggest
54:58 - adding that kind of thing to the
54:59 - tutorial make the first one something
55:01 - that you pretty much cannot fail over
55:03 - here I'm pretty much going to have to
55:04 - approach him and then try to guess let's
55:06 - try to go here go nice and easy approach
55:08 - him and I still don't see any icon but
55:10 - if I CLI okay left click works all right
55:12 - that was good that was nice animation I
55:14 - like the particle effect that was nice
55:15 - the blood pulling in the floor also
55:17 - really nice and I can Corp bag oh wait
55:21 - corpse bag oh okay I can pick it up and
55:24 - I can drop it anywhere all right okay
55:26 - that's that's good I like it now there
55:28 - was another guy down here oh boy okay
55:33 - all right that was a bit way too fast
55:35 - but all right and apparently we go back
55:37 - into way the beginning I would
55:38 - definitely recommend adding some
55:40 - checkpoints but anyways now I know what
55:42 - I need to do so let me just quickly go
55:44 - through all of these so I got to pick it
55:45 - up again yep okay let me open oh boy the
55:49 - camera is really tricky like when I'm
55:52 - over here I assume that pressing e is
55:54 - going to rotate this way but as I do it
55:56 - apparently rotates the other way so that
55:58 - is really confusing but okay oh I didn't
56:00 - even see there was another door here oh
56:03 - so you can actually see the conate all
56:05 - right so it seems that me going through
56:07 - the left door that wasn't actually
56:09 - intentional so yeah I definitely say
56:11 - tutoral should force me down here
56:13 - instead of to the other one this shows
56:15 - how to kill the enemy how to see the
56:16 - viewon in the state and see visual hints
56:19 - for the active item okay visual
56:22 - instructions for the active item oh okay
56:24 - so we chose the range oh and you can
56:26 - also throw things although I still
56:28 - haven't figured out how to use different
56:30 - weapons but okay so I go here and I can
56:33 - apparently walk all over cuz she's not
56:36 - going to wake up oh Control Plus move
56:38 - Mouse use the free look oh okay so
56:40 - that's good I like it being able to see
56:42 - further that's nice can I go outside I
56:44 - can't okay if I use the X in order to be
56:47 - able to see the range of things all
56:50 - right and if I middle Mouse click I can
56:52 - see the viewcon okay so that's good all
56:54 - right right so I got to take out this
56:55 - guy down here and that one up there I
56:57 - still haven't figured out how to use
57:00 - different weapons that's a bit odd all
57:03 - right got that one oh there's only one
57:06 - left a all right got to do it again okay
57:10 - this definitely does need some
57:11 - checkpoints but okay I got to go through
57:14 - all of these every single time go
57:16 - through all the hints that's quite a bit
57:17 - annoying another thing I would suggest
57:19 - is on the camera over here it seems like
57:21 - it only rotates 90° but in order to hit
57:24 - the the door like this it is really
57:26 - difficult and like this I don't like it
57:28 - I like the other view so I would
57:29 - basically like it to have a 45 degree
57:32 - camera that way I could open all the
57:33 - doors and all these vertical uh walls
57:36 - without having to constantly rotate the
57:38 - camera that would be
57:40 - nice
57:43 - a okay let's try this again for about
57:46 - the sixth
57:52 - time oh God going to run away can I run
57:55 - away uh-oh okay I got to say the
57:57 - controls are a bit strange the
58:03 - camera oh why can't I kill him what what
58:07 - is going
58:08 - on okay that's a
58:10 - bit
58:11 - why okay all right that was quite
58:14 - frustrating oh why can't I kill him okay
58:17 - cuz this swapped weapons again and I
58:19 - don't know why okay I have no idea why
58:22 - this just swapped my weapon but but
58:25 - there's nothing that I can I'm trying to
58:27 - click every button okay so it's the
58:30 - numbers apparently all right that was
58:33 - quite stressful quite annoying so I
58:35 - assume that's what happened a while ago
58:36 - all right that definitely needs that
58:38 - took me way too long to figure out
58:40 - definitely needs at least like some
58:42 - icons of some numbers over there anyways
58:44 - okay so let's see if I can finally do
58:46 - this all right that was good that one is
58:49 - apparently just one shot but okay good
58:51 - to know a crap the door again
58:57 - all right finally oh boy I gotta say
59:00 - that was way too difficult I don't know
59:02 - maybe I just suck but yeah I think that
59:04 - took me about 10 tries so I would say
59:07 - your tutorial level definitely shouldn't
59:08 - require 10 tries 10 fails so that
59:10 - definitely felt way too punishing
59:13 - usually for the first tutorial you
59:14 - really want a super easy challenge so
59:16 - that is why I would recommend adding
59:18 - some kind of dummies just to teach how
59:20 - you actually use the items use the
59:22 - things and definitely not include so
59:25 - many enemies right off the bat on the
59:26 - very first tutal again maybe I just suck
59:28 - at the game but that was definitely my
59:30 - experience and just a quick thing over
59:32 - here challenges there's a small typo
59:34 - okay second level your goal is to steal
59:36 - valuable papers from the head of this
59:38 - small drug Farm do not kill the head
59:40 - okay that's going to be interesting
59:42 - careful this level is hard oh boy even
59:44 - harder than the first one okay that's
59:46 - going to be tricky let's use a civilian
59:48 - AI which can notice you always look
59:50 - before you go all right so that's good
59:54 - all right so now we've got
59:56 - NPCs I know what this plus icon is on
59:58 - top okay that's kind of interesting why
60:00 - did it not see me I mean I like it but
60:03 - yeah that's nice is she not supposed to
60:05 - see me okay so so it's not a problem if
60:08 - she sees me oh it just takes a while for
60:12 - her to wake up there's going to be that
60:15 - guy coming after me so can I take him
60:17 - out all right oh go back back back back
60:20 - back quickly quickly all right got both
60:22 - of them there's another one
60:25 - son of no idea who is is that the guy
60:28 - that I can't kill okay there way so far
60:31 - so good I just took out three guys
60:33 - that's nice we got a nice taser I think
60:36 - I would really prefer if the camera zoom
60:39 - if that snap back to the character
60:42 - because this is so strange right now I
60:43 - have no idea oh doesn't even have a
60:45 - limit is that intentional I assume
60:48 - that's not intentional am I supposed to
60:50 - be able to see that far away either way
60:52 - I really think that it should snap back
60:54 - cuz like this this now it's really
60:56 - tricky interactive tools so there's a
60:59 - cup what can I do with a cup I can pick
61:02 - it
61:03 - up and yeah I guess I can oh it makes
61:06 - noise that's nice once again the whole
61:09 - thing why can't I interact through the
61:11 - wall the camera is really very
61:16 - tricky a okay that was definitely not
61:21 - intended I clicked on the UI and it
61:23 - threw the cup that is not what I wanted
61:26 - okay okay let me try and I throw in
61:30 - there a didn't get him so I guess it
61:33 - would be nice to be able to see the
61:36 - audio range so let me pick try to throw
61:40 - over there okay so that's the maximum
61:42 - all right there they go I'm going to try
61:45 - to jump in and I was
61:48 - spotted he going to kill me oh boy okay
61:51 - it doesn't see me
61:53 - nice that guy doesn't see me
61:56 - either let's see if I can now go in oh
61:59 - right because I can't kill him so this
62:02 - actually a bad spot ah this is
62:05 - locked okay I did not expect that so is
62:08 - this guy supposed to be the B oh no
62:10 - that's a
62:15 - boss ah all right so I think that's
62:17 - going to be it for the game maybe just
62:19 - me but it seems a bit way too difficult
62:21 - way too punishing I definitely add some
62:24 - points I would also look at games like
62:26 - for example Asos 3 to see what they do
62:28 - like for example whenever you get caught
62:30 - whenever you get inside the field of
62:32 - view cone for one of the enemies time
62:34 - slows down you actually have an option
62:36 - to do something whereas over here you
62:38 - just die in one hit so the whole thing
62:39 - becomes really frustrating the camera is
62:41 - also quite a bit frustrating the way
62:43 - that it only rotates in One Direction
62:45 - then does a strange 180 the way that I
62:47 - cannot pick up things through the walls
62:49 - and the way that the Feld of view seems
62:51 - to be higher above ground so it's not
62:53 - exactly perfect as to to where exactly
62:54 - the character is so the game definitely
62:56 - requires some Polish a bunch of changes
62:58 - but all in all I like the general game
63:00 - idea I'm a big fan of stth action game
63:03 - so yep I would say this is a great
63:04 - starting point so keep at it looking at
63:06 - the store Page I do think the store Page
63:08 - is set up pretty nicely so the capsule
63:10 - over here capsule is extremely important
63:12 - I do think this is a nice looking
63:13 - capsule although it makes it seem a bit
63:15 - more like some kind of gang war as
63:17 - opposed to stealth Action so it looks
63:19 - good but might not be 100% accurate to
63:21 - what the game is for the short
63:23 - description usually you want want this
63:24 - to be more from the point of view of the
63:26 - player so like what is the player
63:27 - actually going to do in the game as
63:28 - opposed to pretty much just pointing out
63:30 - some lore some lore and Sor that's
63:32 - always fun but the player usually
63:34 - quickly wants to know what exactly do
63:35 - they do in the game and for that these
63:37 - screenshots I actually do think they are
63:38 - very good they are pretty very they show
63:41 - various scenarios and they show the UI
63:43 - showing how the game actually works so
63:44 - it makes it clear how it's a top down
63:45 - stealth thing the only thing is over
63:47 - here on the big description I always
63:49 - encourage you to put up some animated
63:51 - gifts those always make things look
63:53 - quite a bit better and again same thing
63:55 - instead of writing this from the point
63:56 - of view of more about the game or what
63:59 - features the game has try to write from
64:00 - the point of view of the actual player
64:02 - what does the player actually do in your
64:03 - game so instead of the game features a
64:05 - diverse range of maps instead of that
64:07 - maybe something like play through 10
64:09 - different maps all of them with unique
64:11 - abilities and meet interesting
64:12 - characters something like that in
64:14 - general you really want to write your
64:15 - description from the point of view of
64:17 - the player as opposed to what does the
64:18 - game actually contain so if you like
64:20 - some top down sell action then go ahead
64:22 - and add this into your wish list okay
64:24 - okay so that's five games that you made
64:26 - thanks so much for submitting them I
64:27 - wish you all the best of luck with your
64:29 - full release I hope it helped you to
64:31 - hear my feedback and see how I play the
64:32 - games I know that as a developer myself
64:35 - it was extremely useful to watch people
64:36 - play my own game it helped me improve
64:38 - lots of things that I never thought
64:39 - about simply because different people
64:41 - play games differently so I hope that
64:43 - this video helps you in the same way
64:45 - check out the website page to see all
64:47 - the other games that I didn't have time
64:48 - to play and if you enjoy this format go
64:50 - ahead hit the like button and subscribe
64:52 - if people enjoy this and I'll keep doing
64:54 - it every time there's new seam Festival
64:56 - all right so thanks for watching and
64:57 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your KMI steam just had the October Festival the other day so I asked you which one of your games had Dem was available here I'm going to play through five of your games and give my feedback on both the games themselves in terms of game design usability mechanics and so on and then I will also give feedback on the steam store Pages based on my knowledge of steam game marketing by the way there were actually more than five games submitted so thank you so much for that initially I wanted to go through all of them but this video is already insanely long with just five games this took ages to edit so I really had to limit it to just five there are time stamps in the description for each of the games and I also made a page on the website with links to all the games so you can go play demos for yourself and add them to your wish list now if you enjoy this video go ahead and hit the like button and subscribe if people find this format useful then I'll keep doing it every time there's a steam Festival the next one is actually going to happen in February so if you didn't make it in time for this one then maybe get ready for that one so next up let's look Aton Trooper so Eon Trooper is a thrilling adventure where strategy action and player choice are at the heart of each Mission delve into an territories execute crucial missions and choose between stealth strategy and direct combat to achieve your objectives okay that's a nice a nice little short description I like it nice short into the point and looking at the screenshot it's kind of like a top down shooter sort of thing okay so let's give this a try okay so I quite like the music on the main menu sounds really good okay let's begin with the tutorial all right movement WD of course grenade use stun grenade that's fun Crouch and roll then shoot knife Power Attack and of course supports controller as well but since I'm guessing this a shooter I prefer to use the mouse okay so let's see every time you eliminate an enemy with your knife you can get ammunition or bandages plus your special attack W be charged okay right away I like that mechanic sort of like Doom forcing you to engage in close combat so that's nice when ready to use aim and Destroy multiple enemies in one hit all right okay so that sounds good let's see right away I really like the art it's like some Vector art and it looks really nice really good okay so apparently we make some sound there are some nice music is great everything is looking really good so far can I interact with this thing I already forgot about the controls yeah I definitely have memory issues uh okay so on Q throws a grenade then on R I assume I have limits yeah I assume that's a two and five so an r that throws a sun grenade and didn't an e do something I thought it did something okay so maybe it's the interact how do I pick it up I guess I don't because oh crap I hit on N to reload and I threw another Sun grenade okay yeah I think that's going to be a bit tricky to to handle that uh muscle memory of always hitting R oh so I got a maximum range all right and he dropped some kind of gun okay I'm not seeing any stats so I don't know if this one is better or not okay so the bullets are moving at an interesting speed they're somewhat slow but they are perfect for being able to dodge so that's actually really good okay do I need any how do I pick up the health okay so for the interaction it appears that the interaction is not based on Mouse position rather on the character position okay so I'll have to remember that and again all these weapons it's really nice I always love games where every weapon is dropped every weapon is picked that just fun and do they have different ammo oh they do okay so I guess I should probably stick with my pistol which was somewhere behind this rock but I can't find it again okay so this one has 35 let's see and there was oh right on shift I can Crouch ah so I can essentially and can I throw a grenade over top this nope okay so that doesn't work although the sound is a bit strange because it says the range is like this but apparently they can hear me from quite a bit from F what oh yeah right totally forgot to use the melee and the power okay can I maybe try to sneak behind this guy I'm try to knife him oh nice all right so I think I got a little bit of power oh got something looks like a SMG and I got 150 throw grenade ah all right that was a nice uh radius I don't need any more Health right now I don't know what are these things well I'm assuming the objective disable defense lasers and sabotage the enemy ship okay that sounds good I wasn't there oh right I got a Dodge roll in space so I got to use that as well oh boy okay I went a little bit way too much let's hope this one has some health okay I think I prefer the more impactful shots of the other one I assume it's more impactful would be nice to be able to see the max range so like as I move the cursor past the maximum range I think the cursor should probably go rather or something like that or maybe I was wrong about the max range no cuz yeah if I aim there it doesn't get it there so it would be nice to be able to have visually see okay is that guy in range or not and when these games something that I always really like that always feels really good which I did add and cuz I made a bunch of top down Shooters back in my flash days I've never made a steam game like it but yeah back in the flash days I did and uh yeah basically just making the camera look a little bit towards where the where the player is aiming so basic if I'm aiming to the right side of the camera instead of pointing right down the mdal it should be pointing a little bit to the side that makes the game feel quite a bit more Dynamic so personally if I were developing this game that's one of the things that I would add it makes the camera move quite a bit more and also allows the player to see a little bit further so that's fun o nice one shot does this have head shots or something so I think they weren't being one shot a while ago yeah being able to see guys underneath it's a bit tricky I seee assume that if I touch that I'm going to die so I don't want to touch them I still haven't figured out what are these things maybe that's respawn points I really like a weapon that one shots enemies just one shot although I haven't really used the the uh melee thing I guess I should Dodge yeah but like that I take quite a bit of damage so actually shooting from distance and what are these things I have no idea more crates there got some ammo let me use the oh crap oh crap yeah I wasn't I wasn't expecting that like I tried to use the power but I but I wasn't I didn't know what to expect so I didn't know what was going to happen and yeah that kind of messed me up so I would say for that one I would probably like to see that mechanic and try out that mechanic in a safe space so on some kind of tutorial level just go so that I know what to expect so that this doesn't happen where I basally die just because I had no idea what to expect and all of a sudden and everything went into slow motion I just died instantly okay so do I start everything from scratch would be nice to have a little checkpoint but okay okay so now I got so apparently the star weapon is like the worst one like it has no range so on this one with much shorter range yeah definitely would be very beneficial to being able to see just how far I can shoot so yeah so I much prefer the bigger weapon just just shoots once and just kills them in one shot ah it's really difficult I I don't know what am I oh boy oh boy way too many I don't know how I'm supposed to do melee with them since it is really difficult to do it without getting hit also just a minor polishing thing ah crap a lot of hit boxes uh minor polishing thing would be down here on the health bar make it a little bit more animated so like when I get hit uh the red part should go down but then there should be some kind of white part that only goes down a little bit afterwards in order to demonstrate just how much health that I actually lose with that one shot cuz right now I think I land like five shots but I'm not 100% sure okay let me yeah it would be really nice if the interaction was based on the mouse position cuz yeah oh Bo picking that one up is really tricky yeah really not sure how the I get the idea behind the melee and I like it but it really needs some sort mechanics so that I can safely be able to melee all these enemies without taking tons of damage myself maybe I'm supposed to do something like that just do a Dodge roll really close them okay so maybe that's what I'm supposed to do all right that actually feels good so once again that is something that I would include in some sort of tutorial level teach that mechanic because yeah it does seem like that's what I'm supposed to do instead of just of just moving like that okay okay let me actually pick up a bunch of them just two of them can't I get more boom that was nice should have a few more effects but yeah I like the unlike the mechanic oh and only now I noticed that apparently there's oh crap all right so I guess I got to take this quite a bit slower okay so let's do it slowly now pick up the SMG oh this actually oh did the weapon change oh that's nice I like it all right I really like the the particle oh boy oh boy I put up way too many a all right that was fun but definitely way too intense okay let's try again yeah now I got an SMG yeah the shotgun was much better I would say visually the weapons probably need to be a bit more different cuz I mean I swear the shotgun looked exactly like that one yeah so basically I really I cannot aggro tons of guys at the same time if I do then I can't really also since there's a field of view mechanic that field of view should probably be shown to the player so like that guy gets okay maybe there isn't a field of view maybe just based on distance from the screen okay so basically I was going to say that if it is based on field of view like I can't see him behind that then the area behind that that should probably be a little bit darker but if it's just on the edge of the screen then I guess yeah just fading in although that's a bit strange if it is just on the edge of the screen then I don't think it should fade but okay I guess maybe I'm also supposed to be quite a bit more deliberate with my shots and use stealth quite a bit more oh boy nice I don't know what are these things and I haven't really been using my grenades so I would say for that that I would probably add some sort of timer in the code and if the player has grenades but they haven't used them in quite a while definitely flash it in some way something like that okay let me let me try to actually complete the objectives I would like to have a little special thing nice what is the max four all right that was cool nice can I shoot through the laser no apparently oh I can I just hit the it seems like the hit box yeah the hit box seems a little bit too big usually you want to have the actual hitbox quite a bit smaller than the actual object so the hitbox should be some like 20% smaller than the actual visual object that always makes the game feel quite a bit satisfying it's a small thing but it does matter quite a bit there was a guy there that disappeared and appeared so maybe there is a field of view fog of War sort of effect oh boy how many guys are there on this map nice I got to say when I manage to slide and slash them that feels really satisfying so that should definitely be encouraged just got to oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh okay I really like the sniper the other weapons are fun but yeah the sniper is just and does it have invisibility frames I actually didn't check yet ah I got hit ah I always get hit they really need some sort of mechanic to make it a bit easier to to get within melee range without ah cuz yeah like that oh crap I need oh crap I can't figure it out okay so how do I actually get inside there okay I got to shoot that I assume am I shooting the right thing there are no I mean cuz yeah there are no health bars so I have no idea can I go through the laser I'm assuming I can't and I really don't want to die trying out if I throw a grenade then nope doeses not get anywhere that far okay so I really don't know what the game wants me to do there I mean if the game had checkpoints if I were to die and I'd spawn there then I would com uh I would feel confident in trying out to see if this kills me but without checkpoints knowing that if I die I'm going to have to do the whole thing that makes it quite a bit trickier ah I missed grenade boom I still haven't tried out the oh crap haven't tried out the stun grenade yeah I guess just stuns them makes sense okay so maybe oh boy maybe I was right and not not trying to not trying to I don't know oh okay I got interact with it nice okay so I think I was right and not trying to lower the defenses okay all right let's try this one ah crap the range is terrible I like to shoot them from a distance oh I Mur grenades all right throw that one just mow them all down a crap oh crap a fire of the grenade accidentally am I out of ammo or am I stunned why can't I shoot okay I don't know what happened but I can't shoot why can't I shoot okay I don't know what happened but that weapon stopped working so can I now take this out run away oh boy extraction Zone okay let's go get out this the extraction oh crap I got to survive for 20 second oh boy it's going to be tricky I really wish the game would give me a few grenades right now oh boy yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not going to make it oh come on a oh boy all right yeah that was definitely definitely tricky yeah I really wish the game had given me a few more Health backs somewhere maybe a grenade or two cuz boy that was quite intense yeah say I definitely enjoyed that game so that was definitely quite fun so let's now look at the store page so I think the capsule is really nice nice and spooky nice icon nice logo so the capsule is really good I think the the uh short description over here is also pretty nice I think after playing it my only concern is I don't know how well the seam audience reacts to basically top down shooter but looking at the screenshots there's quite a bit of content so I think if it has quite a bit more abilities I still haven't figured out what those tiny things were supposed to do but anyways so with a bunch more abilities a bunch more weapons a bunch more enemy types more skills things like that maybe it could work again I really don't know cuz top down Shooters they're not quite uh very popular on Steam nowadays I don't know if that's because there aren't too many or because they don't tend to do well I'm not sure about that and yep as always got to check do you have gifts on the store Page I have no idea why this first one isn't animated but yeah all these nice gifts cuz I do think that the shooting Works quite well the sound design is quite good so yeah in general looks like a very wellmade game so I hope it does well let's go and add it to your wish list okay so next up we have TV's the Revival so TV's the Revival is a platformer single player game that balances exciting action with challenging puzzles when the hero U awakens from a coma he is driven through strange events living in the TV's real world to unravel the mysteries of his past and defeat evil forces plaguing the region by the way there's a of type over there on Plague but y a nice short description so basically this is a platformer single player game okay so let's try this okay my mouse is gone so I assume yeah this is like okay I assume this works with a controller okay so looking at the controls so I've got move jump Crouch roll and interact okay all right so let's go new game okay so apparently the story TVs are fighting one another and then something happened okay so right away in terms of visuals I quite like it obviously got some excellent use of lighting some excellent use of volumetric lighting volumetric fog so in terms of visuals right with looks really nice okay so this is a 2 and a half de platformer so I can only move left and right well that looks really bright okay so far so good and the reflections on the floor oh really nice yeah visually speaking right way it looks great oh boy okay I assume that's not intentional so I got stuck somewhere so I got the Crouch and why was a Dodge roll and then I've got an interact okay all right so the camera there it has no Cuts that's nice I like it looks good so far in terms of level design everything looks really nice and varying can I interact with this oh I can put questions why is the TV pointing straight down okay wow in terms of variety of environments quite a bit everything looks really nice oh boy okay okay all right well there you go okay so I apparently have to dodge the cameras so how do I dodge that if I can't jump above it can I just go slow nope or I guess maybe I am supposed to speed through it that sounds a little counterintuitive because I just got interact I can't interact with anything so I assume that I just have to speed through it okay yeah that definitely feels a little bit counterintuitive but okay all right I'll keep that in mind oh boy timing elements go on go on Oh I thought oh okay the it's a strange pattern it's got like three or four states okay go go go that one does it only have that one right okay so that looks like one of the bad cameras I can only move left and right so okay I got to get behind that little but why do I have to take this with me I assume I have to take it with me okay go go go okay apparently I don't need to take this with me or maybe I do oh boy I feel like I can just barely make it ah okay good all right then the background looks really nice they're destroying robots destroying TVs that's a bit dark let's go elevator oh so I die based on looking at the sun is that it okay so apparently the sun is bad for TVs okay so this is the sun this is not the sun right let me wait wait for that one to go down go go go come on go down down down all right nice go go go uh do I have to time it oh go go go go go almost oh things that fall down I assume oh there's an extra box here I assume I'm going to need this for something is there like a secret in there or something or I guess not I guess this is the intended thing cuz through here I can't go oh now there are TVs with guns okay so when is that TV going to shoot me do they see me okay so I guess I'm safe here again I really like how the camera moves in just one take I assume this is very very much inspired by limbo and inside and those kinds of games let's go Sprint Sprint Sprint get all the way here and Crouch even though I think I could Sprint through all way through go go go okay so I assume that light is in the background oh is there a way to get up there all right guess that's where I need to go right yeah I'm going to guess that I or not or maybe yes oh wa yeah I guess there's no way to go through right cuz that guy is I assume he's going to one shot me go go Sprint Sprint go nope all right that was fun okay so I'm really going to need to pick up a box or do I need to carry two boxes can I just jump on this one no it's not doesn't yeah does pick up okay so I thought I need to push it all the way back but apparently not okay yeah visually speaking the gamees looks really great it has a really nice use of lighting fog all kinds of effects all of them looks really nice okay so I need to get this box down there yeah I don't think that I can get through that guy so can I pick it up all right okay so there's a patrol guy there okay got to wait quite a bit for him to come through and go away okay jump and let's go run run run keep going oh how do how do I push this okay so I I grabed the holes okay go down nice right so I got to wait for the platform would be nice if the right stick allowed me to look a little bit ahead CU right now basically just waiting for the platform to come back all right okay the camera is shaking why is the camera shaking what am I controlling just a second one so do I have to stop him what does stopping do I don't know but I assume that I have to get onto this one and then jump out to that one then the next one but I don't see the next one go go go okay now what yeah I think now I'm screwed because I assume the other one is going to stop at that point let's see if it does okay yeah so that one stopped at that point so so how am I supposed to I'm pretty sure there's nowhere that I can go is there okay so I really don't know cuz I need to be sort of position it in the middle but I'm pretty sure I can't make that jump can I I'm pretty sure I cannot make this jump nope not even close Okay so honestly I'm quite a bit confused I'm not sure what am I supposed to do because this one just keeps that one moving our stop it yeah it just gets to that one oh I think it's timing thing okay so I need to get like super close to this one so I think like this one might actually work okay this is quite a tricky thing stop it a little bit okay is that going to be enough or is it going to get there too fast yeah it's going to get there too fast right come on move faster no yeah now it's moving the other direction I can't get it nope right so I got to say the puzzle definitely increased quite massively in terms of difficulty okay so I got to stop this one here I'm going to wait pretty much until the last possible moment all right so like this oh crap is it going to be two prob oh it is isn't it yeah I can't make that jump nope so I got to like wait pretty much yeah cuz they have the same speed so pretty much yeah cuz then I also needed to be super close to oh come on I also needed to be super close to the other guy so I guess I need to use that one primarily for timing yeah it needs to be close enough for me to jump on the other guy and hopefully that won't be close enough for this one as well right come on can I make the jump I can all right now can I make the second jump on where's the other one okay I'm in all right well that was tricky game was being super easy no puzzle no nothing and all of a sudden became really tricky all right let's go nice let's call in the elevator can I call in the elevator okay so I can do something up here and something down there okay so I got to drop the box over there let's first grab the elevator up there okay so I got to basically it's pushing me no uh well actually it doesn't matter yeah I can just the box is quite a bit floaty definitely should fall down with a bit more of a thunk but yeah all right next one nice I guess right now if anything the only thing is doesn't feel like it has much of a progression although to be fair I'm not the target audience for these kinds of games you know kind of like limbo inside very story Focus or supposedly story Focus uh platformer games that's usually not the kind of game games that I tend to play so I don't know what players of those games of those genres expect but yeah everything has a really great Vibe but okay I assume that's going to fall down so oh boy that one falls down as well that one as well all right nice see compared to that other to that other one this one is much easier okay is that pushing me it kind of feels like yeah it's just a uning bug yeah okay so how do I do this yeah I would say the the interface over there needs to be a little bit more visible maybe flash lights or something cuz yeah but anyways yep let's go and just roll I really like the roll it's fun oh there's one on the back there I didn't even see it let's go roll TR to that one roll and let's go yeah I totally missed that that first uh controller there right some really nice posters yeah in terms of art it definitely looks unique having a bunch of TV face characters definitely looks quite strange quite unique you got two more controls what does this one do so always rotates that one clockwise oh did I just accidentally get it I think I just accidentally got it okay I mean I'm not a fan of puzzle so yeah I'll take blind luck over skill any day yeah all right that was good okay I guess I made it that was probably supposed to be quite a bit more comp likes but okay all right so we got some lasers okay so I got to jump almost oh crap no don't shoot me oh that's going to be tricky how do I hide from it there's a oh God I don't want to risk it yeah I could probably have risked it a how do I get oh I can Crouch under I suppose so let me just go ah no NOP okay wait go yeah if I roll it doesn't actually okay no I thought I could Crouch but apparently I can't so I don't have any safety from that thing so I got to pretty much just Sprint the hall way through yeah I guess so but if I Sprint I'm going to die oh okay so it doesn't actually hit every shot ah okay so I got to keep moving but can I push this I can't so oh okay once again that was just blind luck I did not expect that I was not actively trying to do that but again I'll take it come on come on oh nope NOP nope okay so come again Dodge it okay go out push push push all right no crap go go go all right nice there's a box there I assume I'm I'm going to need it so I might as well take it with me uhoh red lights Dodge now what okay so I guess it's kind of like a boss fight with stages now they're all out intentionally okay oh boy go go go go all right that's fun that's a fun idea for a boss fight I guess uh okay so now what I assume at some point it's going to disable nope nope okay okay nice do I pass in oh boy how do I dodge this really nice camera motion nice oh did I die instantly a that's annoying yeah cuz I was on the other Edge oh now I got to carry the box with me yeah this this little checkpoint should definitely be quite a bit further ahead okay so Dodge this one okay jump that one now that one is intermittent so turn it on turn it off good and now I got to wait at the corner all right okay so now I know that apparently it's going to damage me if I'm on the left side so I got to be on this side order to run away oh okay that that was a bit abrupt but yeah that was that was definitely nice all right so yeah in terms of style definitely has a style definitely has quite an interesting artistic look I'm not sure about storying about what am I supposed to be doing what what is going on but I'm definitely intrigued with the whole TV aesthetic with weapons and doing so yeah definitely considering how this is genre that lives or dies based on Sal loone then yeah I would say so far looking great so looking at the store Page in terms of the capsule yep it is excellent I think the low is actually a little bit sub part compared to all the excellent artart that the game has logo seems a bit too basic but sure it's a nice capsule so yeah the short description I think it's also pretty decent so it says what the game is so platformer single player so that's nice down here again I really like this image I would only suggest make it an actual animated gift so like make these little units move forward maybe the guy in the background move a little bit maybe the smoke move so I think this would uh it's a really nice image really nice composition but I think it would be better as a GI and that I actually think the boss fight is probably the least impressive part so I would probably take a gift from any of the other parts in in the game but yeah like for example I think this one looks much better than that one that one looks a bit confusing I only know that it's a boss because I played demo without playing the demo I would have no idea what exactly is going on here whereas down here it looks clear that it's an environment so up here I would probably put a gift of the character playing moving around doing something so yeah but some nice gifts visually the game looks great so I think that should be the main selling point and yeah like I said not really my kind of game not really my kind of genre but I really enjoyed my time with it it was nice it was mysterious a spencil and Visually which is a big part of this genre visually definitely wor the game looks quite gorgeous so yeah really nice yeah great job nice so let's go ahead add it to your wish list all right so game number two is overrider so take on a highspeed hoverboarding Adventure through a postapocalyptic World make tricks craft gadgets and fight robots to stop an AI Onslaught threatening to wipe about the remains of humanity all right so let's give this shot all right so this one seems like a racing driving game so I'm going to be using a controller it's got a nice feedback window so that's always good it opens up a simple Windows Form so that's a super easy way to get some feedback and as always when getting feedback you want to make it as easy as possible for the user so yep just being able to choose between numbers instead of having to write tons of text Yep this is great same thing for the other Buton so wish list yep you should always have this devlogs okay so this is nice and Discord community again if you can do it that's great all right so let's start off okay we got some nice storting first thing that I would say is just add some simple text animation to the text that is one of those things that is super easy to add and that's quite a bit of Polish makes everything look quite a bit better just a simple text writer same thing for the character animations that could easily be polished with just making a handful of frames of Animation literally just moving the mouth and nothing else okay use rotor shift downhill some left trigger okay so left trigger brings me down and I can use momentum to start going oh left bumper all right okay not sure how am I supposed to do tricks do that mean oh boy okay I have no idea how do I actually okay XB okay somehow I get feel like okay so I feel like somehow I jumped off where I wasn't supposed to cuz I have no idea how do I perform tricks all right apparently I performed a trick there okay I would say I'm definitely quite a bit lost I have no idea how do I gain more power more something like perform trick so I'm pressing the right Mouse bumper but it doesn't I don't know how do I perform the actual tricks I don't know if I'm supposed to do something to this battery Rush delivery battery okay so we got some nice inor missions although it's a bit tricky that I still have no idea what the controls are actually like so okay apparently I failed that all right so I really would like to find my way back into the tutorial CU I have no idea what I missed okay so I really have no idea how am I supposed to perform any tricks so really no clue what just happened all right so yeah I think I'm just going to go back to the main menu and try to start a new game okay so let's see if now this time I don't miss where I'm supposed to go sound like went down there use rotar shift down here H okay perform tricks but I have no idea how am I supposed to perform tricks I pressed the left Mouse button and now I just lost okay I really have no idea what exactly I'm missing so am I supposed to go down there or not okay so I fell down here again okay I just picked up something again I have no idea what it is cu apparently I can't pick it up okay and I just fell down again so I'm going to quit again okay trying out again so let's see if now I can make okay go downhill yes I am going downhill now what perform tricks in the air to charge your end so I press okay so I finally figured it out that I was somehow pressing right bumper instead of left bumper okay so now I'm kind of getting the hang of it oh that's cool so I can destroy it oh and that's how you damage as well do I have health anywhere okay there it is 44 all right got to say it feels a bit strange how I have to hit them head on not sure how I'm supposed to die the bullets did I get them nope all right there you go oh are they respawning am I supposed to damage this no I guess not find destroy two rors I only got 6 hp so I hope it works okay oh god oh boy oh boy oh boy no no no no okay it seems I died I quite like the visuals I think in terms of visual style the game doesn't look quite nice and in terms of the movement mechanics it took me a bit to finally understand them but yep I do think the game plays quite well once you understand how it works although I still haven't quite figured out how exactly am I supposed to not take damage considering how they attack me like this cuz like I can only attack them if I go straight to them I guess I am supposed to just try to dodge them and then attack them I'm not sure where am I supposed to get some health all right cool but yeah the combat does feel nice the attacks feel nice and satisfying I assume that the faster I go the more it damages so hav figured out the the uh the tricks how do I do different tricks is it supposed to be random or is it supposed to have some kind of control because it seems like it doesn't matter which way I'm moving it always seems to do the same thing go one two three and I can hit it oh boy I'm already out of Health again woo let's go down oh boy I really like how inventive the robots are oh boy that's a big one all right nice the world does seem to be quite open quite variant quite vast so that's good I really like the fov everything looks pretty nice some random damage building here oh is that a healing station I could actually use that is it oh it is nice does it have a map nope I think the only issue is since the game is all movement Pace it seems to have way too many flat planes so like over here there's not much where I can have fun and go fast it's all way too flat so I'm not sure like I want to go in that direction it seems like I got to go through a super slow speed maybe the Boost effect maybe that one should reload naturally cuz like this yeah so do I slide down there in order to go in there I'm not sure sure okay so is this where I'm supposed to come I think I was in the middle of making some Mission oh so I got to get the other things let try to get these guys boom I get him oh God almost nothing nice okay I got to go there okay how do I go there but in terms of environment I quite like this world everything looks really nice lots of apocalyptic vegetation stuff like that looks really again how do I get there NOP not here battery Rush challenge nope okay I assume I have to go through here now what oh God okay so I have no idea if I'm even going in the right direction or not I have no idea how I'm supposed to get there okay so I've been playing for about 40 minutes so here's my thoughts basically in terms of the world in terms of the creation of the world itself the visuals everything looks really good I really like it in terms of the movement mechanics they take a little while to understand but after I do it seems to work quite well so that's quite good however in terms of world traversal well it's really great that the world is really big it also makes it really boring how there are so few Hills so there's like very few opportunities for me to actually get any speed and it's very easy to lose the speed then on the tutorial I was also completely confused as to what buttons to click that's definitely my fault since I haven't used a controller in quite some time so I was confusing left bumper with right bumper but still it would be nice to have some extra buttons explaining which one should I be using and in terms of guidance on the world while the world is great it's very huge very varied looks great I really think it should have some actual proper guided waypoints in the middle of the world so that I know where I need to go and I don't know if I'm missing something but I can't actually get to this Waypoint so that's a bit strange so in general looks pretty nice plays pretty nice just needs quite a bit more guidance for the player looking at the store Page the capsule is a bit OD I like the art I do think the art looks good but it doesn't make it super clear that this is some kind of hoverboard and the overrider over there it's a bit hard to read so in general I like the colors but I think it could have a bit better composition to make it a bit more clear what the game is actually about I think it should make it absolutely clear that you play as a hoverboard that is something pretty unique that very few games have so I think that should be one of the main selling points description is great talks about what you do so take on a highspeed hoverboarding Adventure make tricks craft gadgets and so on so I do think that's good screenshots also pretty good they're also quite varied they show quite a lot of the game quite a lot of the world so those are really nice over here having a gift for add to wish list that is really good that is really nice and gifts over here on the entire description really great work so if you like some fast Bas hoverboarding on a nice huge open world with lots of movement action lots of things then go ahead and add this one to your wish list okay so next up we have le with a strange character over there on the a that is always an interesting choice going for weird characters it's always interesting to see how various store Pages handle things like that for example Steam on the actual URL does actually include that a so create your own medieval Kingdom and watch your world come to life in this minimalistic city bunder choose your world size and shape and turn it into a kingdom any ruler would be jealous of sounds interesting so let's see okay welcome to the Le demo find controls by pressing the question mark in the top left and enjoy unlock new tiles by finishing builds and exploring fun and weird ways to build your kingdom okay so this one doesn't even have a main menu just go straight into the game so for a game like this that's great just get started right away let you see the controls so wnd in order to move the camera seems to move a bit slow but okay that works Tab and shift to rotate okay that's good nice and satisfying I really like the sound effect okay great then click to build right click to destroy duplicate change roof colors well that's an interesting feature rotate the building and switch a building okay so this looks like some kind of gate thing so let's put it over here okay what am I selecting okay I'm selecting a house now so let's put a house over there let's put a little Tower there another gate how do I rotate with the r oh and I can switch oh okay so am I supposed to switch buildings automatically or not how do I okay tab to rotate I put some trees some little things there another thing okay so I got a little entrance and behind I've got my nice little kingdom finish build Ah that's a nice animation okay so I've got a large Tower it's a tower but large with a tall pointy roof and a bridge bridge on water and a wallgate I got to say the animations for the text I really like it and all the satisfying sound effect those all sound really good oh so now I restart instead of basically continuing to build on this one okay so let's restart that one okay so now I got a big tower let's put a big tower over here on the corner let's put a thing over there I have no idea what that is some kind of wall with a strange hole okay and put some more things and some more walls and another Tower here and maybe another Tower there can I remove this one I want to put a a little tent in the middle it's actually quite a bit tricky okay there you go tent in the middle and another wall over here okay so this one should be a wall Corner some kind of thing oh I can't find the wall corner is that intended yeah I can't find on this one either oh so are the parts limited cuz I can't find a wall Corner okay so let's put just some trees over here and on the other side also some trees right there you go there's my super cute little tiny thing with two towers okay let's go finish building again the sound effects sound really nice so apparently that did not give me anything so let's see what am I actually supposed to be doing okay and goes to a steam guide I have to say I'm not sure how many players actually enjoy going into an external guide so I would say putting this inside the game is probably for the best so tals are unlock by getting ingame achievements okay so that's actually pretty nice making achievements gives you more tals that's a a nice simple way to do it oh and I can change the tile of the world all right so that's good I actually prefer a bigger world so let's go with five and again if if it is related to achievements would be nice to be able to see the achievements directly in game what is square do oh it makes it square or Circle okay that's good so I can build a bunch more things all right let's put a big one going I put another big one no some trees over there okay a bunch of trees I have no idea what that is supposed to be all right it's a little bit strange how everything is so pixeling but then over here the shadow is like super high resolution compared to the rest so that's a bit of a a strange visual thing but okay so I can place more trees more camps more things so just fill in the whole world with trees and camps what about walls we continue making some walls over here okay I'm definitely not someone who is good at visual things as you can tell it's definitely not the most appealing uh little castle I I have no idea what that is that meant to be like a tiny gate is that it okay that's my nice Castle put a couple more Towers okay lots of trees lots of things behind and basically the bad guys come in front something like that all right so I think that's a that okay apparently that did not make me an achievement so my suggestion would be in the beginning in the first few playthroughs definitely give the player at least something so I got a few new buildings on the first world but then the second and the third I got nothing so it would be nice to have something that guarantees the player always gets a little bit of something or at least maybe some kind of indicator over here talking about the next easiest achievements I think that's the main thing I think the goal with the achievements that is a good idea but it really needs to be shown in game rather than having to go into the Steam Workshop to see that okay so apparently even on the overlay I can't see the achievements so that's odd okay so it appears the game doesn't actually have achievements yet or does it only have these ones okay so let me try to make a five world complete okay make a five world like this and just complete it on everything okay try to make just some massive walls and everything try to finish it did I miss one oh crap I think I missed one okay let me try it again just place a mountain of walls all right okay so that worked a w with stairs easier to access than any of the other ones Cavalry so those are supposed to be horses that kind of looks like a trevet okay so there are a bunch more achievements place a rock on a one toown world although suddenly I have no idea which one is wrong is this A rock on a one town world this is the Cavalry this is some wall okay is this supposed to be Rock I guess it would be nice to have some kind of text saying Which object do I have selected so let's see if this one is a rock nope apparently not not okay maybe I just don't have the rock place a house on a one tile World okay is this the house let's see okay let's see this one a three town world with no Castle objects so a three town world no Castle objects so I have no idea what that is does cly count as a castle object well let's put just some okay does that work all right got some water nice there's a timer counting down demo time I have no idea what happens when that one gets down to zero okay so let's see this one have more Cavalry than houses so on the three town world let's see which one was Cavalry I don't have Cavalry okay so that's a bit strange I still haven't figured out what is the logic behind which blocks do I have available okay so my thoughts the idea is definitely interesting the music is definitely quite chill so I quite like that it does visually look like one of those relaxing games so I think visually in terms of Music everything works quite great the concept of going for the achievements I also like that I think that is pretty good it reminds me of a flash game that I used to love called Achievement Hunter was that the name I think so where you just made thousands of achievements that was a really awesome game so I think this could have a similar satisfying feeling to that one the only thing it needs is obviously some list of achievements directly inside the game as opposed to being on a external guide and also would be nice to be able to see the name of the things that I'm placing and maybe just say a suggestion of what is the next easy achievement that I could achieve but in terms of going for a minimalist super simple relaxing City Builder yep it does seem to be on the right track looking at the store Page I have to say this background works really well in game but over here it looks way too minimalistic I would say overly minimalistic to the point where it looks slow quality even though in the game it actually makes sense it actually works out but over here on the store Page it makes it look a bit worse so maybe the game could feature on like two modes have one mode where the background is kind of like this void where it's just a gradient and have another one where it's an actual physical background I think that would help at least make the screenshots look a bit more inviting same thing for the capsule I do think the title I do think that is really good Andy Castle on the side also looks pretty nice again it's really just a background that seems overly basic the short description is nice short and to the point down here yep we've got some gifts so that's great make your kingdom as small or as big so that's nice I would actually make this first gift start off as just a 1 by one world then expand to an 11 by1 world I think that would be a bit more visually unique and it really well written over here we've got various B points and apparently one of them is frog so I have no idea what that means but okay so you feel like a chill relaxing minimalist City builder then go ahead and add this one to your wish list all right so the first game we're going to look at is called utter takedown so this one is a top down technical stealth game set in the 2000s you have been a Hitman for a long time but after you stopped working with the local Mafia it decided to kidnap your family to get rid of you now your goal is to make the other Mafia take it out let's try out the demo and then I'll analyze the seam store Page all right so first thing is on the main menu there's a really nice wish list on seam button this is always something to have so that's great Discord is also great if you can manage that community and I also like the road map showing all the kinds of things that are coming up in the final release the buttons they do have some sound effects so that's good but they are super basic buttons they have no impact whatsoever so I would recommend adding some Polish to the buttons so they pop up in some way or at least change in a much more visually significant manner so it could be as simple as just making the text turn black and the background turn white then I'll the logo over here it looks super pixelated which I'm guessing means just forgot to add the MIP Maps if you just enable MIP maps and this should look quite a bit better okay so let's try out the tutorial okay that's a great transition I really like that one video tutorials always a great thing I always enjoy that so let's see okay so w to move all right okay I really like the sound area there's somebody asleep so right away it makes me test if I move closer does anything happen oh okay so I kind of expect there to wake up apparently I can interact so I don't know but anyway great use of the custom cursors this is something that actually not many games use but it's something that always makes your game feel quite a bit more polished if you have a custom cursor as opposed to the default one okay so anyways let's try following the goal so you can run faster with shift and as you run there's more noise okay great I have to say the running doesn't seem like it's much of a difference definitely doesn't seem quite as impactful I would say to make it more impactful to make it run quite a bit faster but then again that would break balance so I don't know if that was a delivered choice but it does look a little bit way too sluggish I would say but let's see if it works with everything else apparently we can interact with some objects all right so apparently it's right click okay so I can pick up a knife and I can pick up okay it would be nice to have a little tool tip to know what this is I assume that's a taser maybe the tutorial will talk about it in the future okay yep pick up items with right Mouse button you should be close enough okay so that's great interacting with other objects just left Mouse button all right you can change the camera angle and open doors with this technique okay so we can open doors by modifying the camera all right that's interesting how exactly do I open doors with that okay that's a bit all right so apparently the camera has a bit of a strange Behavior it looks like it's intentional to not do a 180 so as I press Q it rotates this area now I press Q again and I would expect to rotate the other way but apparently goes back here so that's a little bit confusing but okay I guess I can get used to it okay let's open up doors okay yeah the camera rotation is definitely quite a bit tricky I'm doing 180s when that is not my intention okay no like this yeah all right being able to interact with all that's great in a game like this being able to add these kind of tiny interactions these are always right so I'd recommend also adding an interaction over here with the sinks that would be fun the more interactions you had the more it makes your game feel much more living so that's always great okay so I see a bad guy there and there's no view cone so I'm going to have to guess as to how much can you actually see but I'm also going to have to guess how I'm going to attack him I still haven't figured out how I can use the taser weapon oh boy there's another one okay apparently can't see me all the way back here so for a stealth game I would appreciate if it was easier to be able to see the view cones is this okay no this just shows the interactable objects all right so yeah for attacking I still know do I left click do I right click and that is going to be a bit stressful since this is a stealth game so usually what you want to do in a tutorial like this one is you want it to be able to have the first attack Beyond some kind of dummy some kind of that does not attack you back so I would suggest adding that kind of thing to the tutorial make the first one something that you pretty much cannot fail over here I'm pretty much going to have to approach him and then try to guess let's try to go here go nice and easy approach him and I still don't see any icon but if I CLI okay left click works all right that was good that was nice animation I like the particle effect that was nice the blood pulling in the floor also really nice and I can Corp bag oh wait corpse bag oh okay I can pick it up and I can drop it anywhere all right okay that's that's good I like it now there was another guy down here oh boy okay all right that was a bit way too fast but all right and apparently we go back into way the beginning I would definitely recommend adding some checkpoints but anyways now I know what I need to do so let me just quickly go through all of these so I got to pick it up again yep okay let me open oh boy the camera is really tricky like when I'm over here I assume that pressing e is going to rotate this way but as I do it apparently rotates the other way so that is really confusing but okay oh I didn't even see there was another door here oh so you can actually see the conate all right so it seems that me going through the left door that wasn't actually intentional so yeah I definitely say tutoral should force me down here instead of to the other one this shows how to kill the enemy how to see the viewon in the state and see visual hints for the active item okay visual instructions for the active item oh okay so we chose the range oh and you can also throw things although I still haven't figured out how to use different weapons but okay so I go here and I can apparently walk all over cuz she's not going to wake up oh Control Plus move Mouse use the free look oh okay so that's good I like it being able to see further that's nice can I go outside I can't okay if I use the X in order to be able to see the range of things all right and if I middle Mouse click I can see the viewcon okay so that's good all right right so I got to take out this guy down here and that one up there I still haven't figured out how to use different weapons that's a bit odd all right got that one oh there's only one left a all right got to do it again okay this definitely does need some checkpoints but okay I got to go through all of these every single time go through all the hints that's quite a bit annoying another thing I would suggest is on the camera over here it seems like it only rotates 90° but in order to hit the the door like this it is really difficult and like this I don't like it I like the other view so I would basically like it to have a 45 degree camera that way I could open all the doors and all these vertical uh walls without having to constantly rotate the camera that would be nice a okay let's try this again for about the sixth time oh God going to run away can I run away uhoh okay I got to say the controls are a bit strange the camera oh why can't I kill him what what is going on okay that's a bit why okay all right that was quite frustrating oh why can't I kill him okay cuz this swapped weapons again and I don't know why okay I have no idea why this just swapped my weapon but but there's nothing that I can I'm trying to click every button okay so it's the numbers apparently all right that was quite stressful quite annoying so I assume that's what happened a while ago all right that definitely needs that took me way too long to figure out definitely needs at least like some icons of some numbers over there anyways okay so let's see if I can finally do this all right that was good that one is apparently just one shot but okay good to know a crap the door again all right finally oh boy I gotta say that was way too difficult I don't know maybe I just suck but yeah I think that took me about 10 tries so I would say your tutorial level definitely shouldn't require 10 tries 10 fails so that definitely felt way too punishing usually for the first tutorial you really want a super easy challenge so that is why I would recommend adding some kind of dummies just to teach how you actually use the items use the things and definitely not include so many enemies right off the bat on the very first tutal again maybe I just suck at the game but that was definitely my experience and just a quick thing over here challenges there's a small typo okay second level your goal is to steal valuable papers from the head of this small drug Farm do not kill the head okay that's going to be interesting careful this level is hard oh boy even harder than the first one okay that's going to be tricky let's use a civilian AI which can notice you always look before you go all right so that's good all right so now we've got NPCs I know what this plus icon is on top okay that's kind of interesting why did it not see me I mean I like it but yeah that's nice is she not supposed to see me okay so so it's not a problem if she sees me oh it just takes a while for her to wake up there's going to be that guy coming after me so can I take him out all right oh go back back back back back quickly quickly all right got both of them there's another one son of no idea who is is that the guy that I can't kill okay there way so far so good I just took out three guys that's nice we got a nice taser I think I would really prefer if the camera zoom if that snap back to the character because this is so strange right now I have no idea oh doesn't even have a limit is that intentional I assume that's not intentional am I supposed to be able to see that far away either way I really think that it should snap back cuz like this this now it's really tricky interactive tools so there's a cup what can I do with a cup I can pick it up and yeah I guess I can oh it makes noise that's nice once again the whole thing why can't I interact through the wall the camera is really very tricky a okay that was definitely not intended I clicked on the UI and it threw the cup that is not what I wanted okay okay let me try and I throw in there a didn't get him so I guess it would be nice to be able to see the audio range so let me pick try to throw over there okay so that's the maximum all right there they go I'm going to try to jump in and I was spotted he going to kill me oh boy okay it doesn't see me nice that guy doesn't see me either let's see if I can now go in oh right because I can't kill him so this actually a bad spot ah this is locked okay I did not expect that so is this guy supposed to be the B oh no that's a boss ah all right so I think that's going to be it for the game maybe just me but it seems a bit way too difficult way too punishing I definitely add some points I would also look at games like for example Asos 3 to see what they do like for example whenever you get caught whenever you get inside the field of view cone for one of the enemies time slows down you actually have an option to do something whereas over here you just die in one hit so the whole thing becomes really frustrating the camera is also quite a bit frustrating the way that it only rotates in One Direction then does a strange 180 the way that I cannot pick up things through the walls and the way that the Feld of view seems to be higher above ground so it's not exactly perfect as to to where exactly the character is so the game definitely requires some Polish a bunch of changes but all in all I like the general game idea I'm a big fan of stth action game so yep I would say this is a great starting point so keep at it looking at the store Page I do think the store Page is set up pretty nicely so the capsule over here capsule is extremely important I do think this is a nice looking capsule although it makes it seem a bit more like some kind of gang war as opposed to stealth Action so it looks good but might not be 100% accurate to what the game is for the short description usually you want want this to be more from the point of view of the player so like what is the player actually going to do in the game as opposed to pretty much just pointing out some lore some lore and Sor that's always fun but the player usually quickly wants to know what exactly do they do in the game and for that these screenshots I actually do think they are very good they are pretty very they show various scenarios and they show the UI showing how the game actually works so it makes it clear how it's a top down stealth thing the only thing is over here on the big description I always encourage you to put up some animated gifts those always make things look quite a bit better and again same thing instead of writing this from the point of view of more about the game or what features the game has try to write from the point of view of the actual player what does the player actually do in your game so instead of the game features a diverse range of maps instead of that maybe something like play through 10 different maps all of them with unique abilities and meet interesting characters something like that in general you really want to write your description from the point of view of the player as opposed to what does the game actually contain so if you like some top down sell action then go ahead and add this into your wish list okay okay so that's five games that you made thanks so much for submitting them I wish you all the best of luck with your full release I hope it helped you to hear my feedback and see how I play the games I know that as a developer myself it was extremely useful to watch people play my own game it helped me improve lots of things that I never thought about simply because different people play games differently so I hope that this video helps you in the same way check out the website page to see all the other games that I didn't have time to play and if you enjoy this format go ahead hit the like button and subscribe if people enjoy this and I'll keep doing it every time there's new seam Festival all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
