00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - overview and the game design for my
00:03 - complete builder defender course
00:05 - this is a really interesting mix of city
00:07 - builders and tower defense games
00:09 - the whole course starts completely from
00:10 - scratch and goes step by step until the
00:12 - final polished game
00:13 - let's begin
00:19 - all right so the content from this video
00:21 - is taken from my builder defender course
00:23 - it covers the game design that we're
00:25 - going to build and then an overview for
00:27 - how we will get there
00:28 - okay so let's see now the first thing to
00:31 - do when making a game is thinking about
00:33 - the design
00:34 - so here's the design we're going for
00:36 - this is a builder defender game so it
00:38 - contains elements from both city
00:39 - builders and tower defense games
00:41 - the player will have the ability to
00:43 - place down buildings those buildings
00:45 - have different types
00:46 - there's the hq which is the main
00:48 - building it gathers wood and can defend
00:50 - itself against enemies
00:52 - if the hq is destroyed then the player
00:53 - loses the game then there's the wood
00:56 - stone and gold harvesters which gather
00:58 - resources and finally the tower which
01:00 - fires projectiles in order to defend the
01:02 - player against enemies
01:03 - then the camera perspective will be
01:05 - front top down
01:07 - there will be three types of resources
01:09 - wood stone and gold
01:11 - the resources are placed on the map as
01:13 - resource nodes and the gatherer
01:14 - buildings must be placed near them
01:17 - there will be enemies which attack the
01:18 - buildings the attack is very simple they
01:21 - move towards the building and explode
01:22 - when they touch it
01:23 - the ai will also be simple they won't
01:26 - target the hq or the closest building
01:27 - within range
01:29 - the enemies won't spawn in waves and
01:30 - keep spawning with an ever increasing
01:32 - difficulty for as long as the player can
01:34 - last
01:35 - at the end we have a game over screen
01:37 - showing how many waves the player
01:38 - survived
01:39 - so that's the core of our game design
01:41 - place buildings gather resources defend
01:43 - from enemies
01:44 - place more buildings expand your area
01:46 - defend from more enemies and repeat
01:48 - it's a relatively simple design which
01:50 - will allow you to learn a ton about
01:51 - unity in general and specifically about
01:54 - these two genres building and defense
01:56 - with the knowledge you'll learn from
01:57 - this course you will be able to make
01:59 - city builders
01:59 - rts's tower defense games tycoons
02:02 - village simulators and so on
02:04 - and we want to make sure that we build
02:05 - the game in a clean way in order to
02:07 - allow for easily expanding opponent in
02:08 - the future
02:09 - so that means structure the code in such
02:11 - a way to easily add more building types
02:13 - resources enemy types and so on
02:15 - and of course as with any design this is
02:17 - merely a starting point
02:19 - game development is all about iteration
02:21 - and as we build and play our game we
02:22 - will get a better understanding of what
02:24 - works and what doesn't
02:26 - then when the basic design is
02:27 - implemented we will get to work on
02:29 - polishing up
02:30 - everything with tons of awesome effects
02:31 - and making the game feel truly great to
02:33 - play
02:34 - alright so this is our design let's get
02:36 - to it
02:37 - okay now before we begin let's run
02:39 - through a quick overview of the home
02:41 - course
02:42 - so we're going to start off completely
02:43 - from scratch so the first thing we do is
02:45 - create a brand new empty project
02:47 - after opening unity we will set up the
02:49 - layout
02:50 - then install the universal render
02:52 - pipeline and finish the project setup
02:55 - once we have our playing canvas the
02:57 - first thing we're going to do is look
02:58 - into the game design
02:59 - this is a very important step so we know
03:01 - the actual design we're trying to
03:02 - implement and with that done we're going
03:04 - to get started on making the game
03:06 - the first task is handling building
03:08 - placement so we can click to place
03:10 - buildings
03:11 - then look into how we're going to handle
03:12 - various building types using scriptable
03:14 - objects
03:15 - after that we will create the resource
03:17 - manager class to hold all of our
03:19 - resource amounts
03:20 - and set up the buildings to generate
03:22 - resources
03:23 - with that done it's time to implement a
03:25 - proper ui and add visuals for the stored
03:27 - resource amounts
03:29 - then set up the world map with a proper
03:31 - background texture
03:32 - with the map setup we're going to use
03:34 - cine machine to control our camera
03:36 - then add the ui element for selecting
03:38 - which building type to place
03:40 - after that create the building ghost so
03:42 - we can see what type of building we are
03:44 - placing
03:45 - then create some proper resource nodes
03:47 - in the world for all of our resource
03:48 - types
03:49 - then we're going to add a bunch of roles
03:51 - to handle building placement
03:53 - they cannot be spawned on top of other
03:55 - objects they cannot be
03:56 - too close to the same type or too far
03:58 - from any building
04:00 - and with all the rules implemented then
04:01 - we add some nice animations
04:04 - set up an overlay to display the
04:06 - generator resource stats
04:08 - after that we're going to add building
04:10 - costs so we need to spend resources in
04:12 - order to place the buildings
04:14 - and we need to show those costs to the
04:15 - players so then we implement a tooltip
04:17 - next we make a health system then get to
04:20 - work on adding the enemies
04:22 - set up their ai to target nearby
04:23 - buildings and deal damage
04:25 - with that we then add defenses for the
04:27 - player in the form of towers
04:29 - they target nearby enemies and shoot
04:31 - arrow projectiles to defend the
04:32 - buildings
04:33 - and then we're going to make a script to
04:34 - handle all the enemy waves and spawn
04:36 - them with
04:37 - increasingly higher difficulty after
04:39 - that we're going to add post-processing
04:40 - to be able to add some cool effects
04:43 - then learn how to use shadowgraph to
04:45 - make awesome custom shaders
04:46 - start off with a simple emission shader
04:48 - and we're also going to inspect the
04:50 - grass wind shader
04:52 - then set up the building construction
04:53 - stage so buildings take some time to be
04:55 - fully built
04:56 - all of that along with a really awesome
04:58 - custom construction shader
05:01 - then make a simple demolish button after
05:03 - that set up the minimap so we can easily
05:06 - look at the whole map
05:07 - then we handle what happens when the
05:09 - player loses with a simple game over
05:11 - screen
05:11 - and make a simple repair button that
05:13 - takes gold to repair
05:15 - then we add some sound effects to a
05:17 - bunch of actions and also add some music
05:20 - make the options menu so we can modify
05:22 - the music and sound volume
05:24 - build a very simple main menu and with
05:26 - all that we will have our core game all
05:28 - fully working which is awesome
05:30 - so after that comes the very important
05:32 - polish stage polish are all the tiny
05:35 - things that improve the game
05:36 - so we start off by adding some
05:38 - separators to the health bar to be able
05:39 - to easily see their health amount
05:41 - then we add some trails to the enemies
05:44 - limit the camera so it doesn't go off
05:46 - screen
05:47 - add the ability to play the whole game
05:49 - with the mouse by implementing edge
05:50 - scrolling learn about player paths and
05:53 - how to save persistent data for our
05:55 - options
05:56 - we can balance all of the various
05:57 - parameters in our game in order to have
05:59 - a coherent experience
06:00 - add some particles when the enemies
06:02 - explode also some more particles when
06:04 - the buildings are placed and destroyed
06:06 - add some screen shake then add some
06:08 - chromatic aberration on top
06:10 - after that make a really simple visual
06:12 - day night cycle
06:14 - then refactor and clean up the code
06:16 - using the game assets class
06:17 - and finally take a good look at the
06:19 - final showcase and see everything that
06:21 - we have built
06:22 - alright so that's it that's the overview
06:24 - of the whole course
06:25 - we're going to start completely from
06:27 - scratch and by going through it step by
06:29 - step
06:29 - we're going to eventually end up with a
06:31 - really awesome builder defender game
06:33 - it's got a really interesting design
06:35 - lots of tiny mechanics and effects and
06:36 - the whole thing plays great
06:38 - alright so that's the game design and
06:40 - overview of the whole course
06:42 - i'm really happy with how it came out
06:44 - and based on the reviews it seems people
06:46 - are really enjoying and learning a ton
06:47 - the course is 10 hours long with over 15
06:50 - lectures nicely organized into distinct
06:51 - topics
06:52 - it teaches you everything on how to make
06:54 - a game starting completely from scratch
06:55 - until the final polished game
06:57 - the lectures are presented as clear step
06:59 - by step tutorials just like my normal
07:01 - videos it teaches you how to make a
07:03 - building system
07:04 - resource management enemy ai world
07:06 - building post processing polish
07:07 - and much much more i'm also constantly
07:10 - looking at the q a section so if you
07:12 - have any questions or want some
07:14 - clarification on a specific topic

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to look at the overview and the game design for my complete builder defender course this is a really interesting mix of city builders and tower defense games the whole course starts completely from scratch and goes step by step until the final polished game let's begin all right so the content from this video is taken from my builder defender course it covers the game design that we're going to build and then an overview for how we will get there okay so let's see now the first thing to do when making a game is thinking about the design so here's the design we're

the attack is very simple they move towards the building and explode when they touch it the ai will also be simple they won't target the hq or the closest building within range the enemies won't spawn in waves and keep spawning with an ever increasing difficulty for as long as the player can last at the end we have a game over screen showing how many waves the player survived so that's the core of our game design place buildings gather resources defend from enemies place more buildings expand your area defend from more enemies and repeat it's a relatively simple design which will allow you to learn a ton about unity in general and specifically about these two genres building and defense with the knowledge you'll learn from this course you will be able to make city builders rts's tower
