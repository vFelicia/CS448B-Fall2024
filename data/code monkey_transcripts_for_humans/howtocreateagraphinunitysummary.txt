00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code machina
00:01 - in this video we're going to view a
00:03 - summary of the creator graph series
00:04 - let's begin
00:08 - so the goal in this series is to make a
00:10 - graph that we can use to display data to
00:12 - the player it won't be able to display
00:15 - any values we give it whilst having many
00:17 - features for how each data point should
00:19 - be represented in the end we're going to
00:21 - view a really use case of this very
00:23 - class being used in a commercial game in
00:24 - battle royale Tycoon so first we're
00:27 - going to create the graph in the editor
00:28 - and set up the basic class as in line
00:31 - graph we're going to create a background
00:32 - and anchor on the transform so our graph
00:35 - has an origin on the lower left corner
00:37 - then set up the code to dynamically add
00:39 - dots for each point in our graph and
00:41 - lines connecting them thereby creating a
00:43 - very simple online graph then we're
00:45 - going to add axis separators so we can
00:48 - easily see where each point is in our
00:50 - graph we're also going to add labels so
00:52 - we can display what the X and y axes
00:54 - represent after that won't focus on
00:57 - scaling our graph so we can display any
00:59 - value first at scaling on the y axis and
01:02 - then on the x axis with the line graph
01:06 - fully functioning we're going to work on
01:08 - converting our graph into a bar chart
01:10 - since our code won't be set up in a
01:12 - clean way it won't be very simple to
01:14 - change the visual representation then
01:17 - we're going to set up the code to be
01:18 - able to swap between different visual
01:20 - interfaces we'll be able to show the
01:22 - same data set using either a online
01:25 - graph or a bar chart or we can also
01:27 - create a new class to fit any custom
01:30 - visualization we need using all of that
01:32 - we will add buttons to manually modify
01:35 - our graph in runtime adding buttons for
01:38 - changing the visual interface how many
01:40 - values are visible and what they
01:41 - represent then we're going to create a
01:44 - simple tooltip so we can see the exact
01:46 - value of each data point it's going to
01:48 - work both with on line graph and the bar
01:50 - chart visuals in order to prepare the
01:54 - graph for updating we're going to create
01:56 - a specific class to handle a single
01:58 - graph visual object first make it to
02:00 - handle the bar chart visual object and
02:02 - then take care of the online graph
02:04 - visual object with each visual object
02:07 - having its own class to handle how it
02:09 - works we're then going to modify the
02:11 - graph class to add updating we're going
02:13 - to make a function which you can modify
02:15 - a single point in our graph without
02:16 - having to completely destroy and rebuild
02:18 - all the points thereby improving
02:20 - performance
02:22 - and finally with all of that we will
02:23 - have a completed class that we can use
02:25 - to display any villain list we want the
02:28 - last video covers a use case of the
02:30 - graph class being used in battle morale
02:32 - tycoon so you can pick up the game on
02:34 - seam and see the class created in this
02:36 - series being used in a real final game
02:38 - so that's the plan for the creator graph
02:41 - series it's very feature-rich and adapts
02:43 - to any value unless you give it the
02:45 - first video starts completely from
02:47 - scratch and each video after that covers
02:49 - one specific feature which add upon one
02:52 - another and in the end you can see the
02:54 - complete class being used in a real game
02:56 - so go watch the playlist and begin
02:59 - learning right now as always you can
03:00 - download the project files and utilities
03:02 - for each video in the series from unity
03:04 - code McKee calm if you have any
03:06 - questions post them in the comments and
03:07 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
03:09 - for more videos and I'll see you next
03:11 - time
