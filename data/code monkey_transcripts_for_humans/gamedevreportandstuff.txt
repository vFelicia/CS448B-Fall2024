02:40 - there it
02:42 - is been a while since I did in live
02:44 - stream so hope you're all doing great
02:46 - hope you've all been doing quite a lot
02:48 - of interesting thing these past few
02:49 - months so yeah
02:57 - nice he accidentally on the stream not
02:59 - quite accidentally just I definitely uh
03:03 - tried planning it honestly I tried
03:05 - planning it since like Wednesday but
03:07 - always so busy with so many things but
03:09 - yeah today finally managed to do a
03:11 - stream it's been a while since I did a a
03:13 - public live stream I mean I normally do
03:15 - the members Z live stream so if you're a
03:17 - member every Saturday uh remember how
03:19 - there's a private live stream to ask any
03:22 - questions something like that but yeah I
03:23 - haven't done a public live stream in
03:25 - quite a bit so yeah so this should be
03:27 - fun should be nice be a command to re
03:30 - randomize my avatar you can just
03:32 - customize it there's a uh I haven't made
03:35 - a video tutorial on it what did I call
03:37 - it custom character custom uh there you
03:41 - go how to make your own custom live
03:43 - stream character or rather you don't
03:45 - have to make a like draw you can draw if
03:47 - you want but you can also just go on to
03:49 - the website customize and you can modify
03:52 - how the whole thing works so that's
03:54 - actually pretty fun pretty nice yeah
03:59 - you think about the new GPT voice model
04:02 - not
04:03 - release not release what does that mean
04:06 - as far as I know it hasn't been out
04:08 - yet but yeah it should be interesting
04:11 - I'm in the original demo when was that
04:13 - like 3 months ago that was quite a while
04:15 - ago that was a definitely an impressive
04:17 - demo so yeah we'll see hey root bin hey
04:19 - how's it going nice yeah if you left
04:21 - making games nope I'm always trying to
04:24 - build things like just recently making
04:26 - the RTS for DOT score so that was a a
04:29 - fun game to to make and yeah in terms of
04:31 - proper game my last game d Guardians
04:33 - came out last year and yeah I definitely
04:35 - still want to get back to it there are
04:36 - still a bunch of things that I want to
04:39 - build upon it not to mention make a
04:40 - console build and all sorts of things so
04:42 - yeah definitely uh still want to do more
04:45 - uh let's say normal game development so
04:47 - on so yeah that should be fun get
04:50 - motivation to code but stream pop up
04:51 - let's see what happens here sure I mean
04:54 - you can make a 5 minute detour to watch
04:56 - the stream and then go back work on your
04:58 - code do your thing so yeah combine both
05:01 - a little bit you know make a nice break
05:02 - then go back to work that's uh should be
05:05 - a fun thing hey Gabor hey how's it going
05:07 - terminal hey everyone all right okay so
05:10 - yeah so by the way this is the game dep
05:11 - report I don't know how many of you know
05:13 - about it it's on the pin comment this is
05:16 - what I've been publishing like every
05:18 - single week for the past I don't even
05:20 - know when did I start the end of May so
05:22 - May June July yeah so I've been doing it
05:24 - for 2 and a half months basically every
05:26 - week sent out a newsletter with a bunch
05:28 - of news so if you want to sa up to date
05:30 - with the latest in Game Dev teen gaming
05:32 - definitely check it out so here let's uh
05:34 - read the last one which actually had
05:35 - some uh really interesting things so
05:37 - yeah that should be fun can I work on a
05:40 - game on Steam when I don't have
05:42 - Steamworks and the account holder only
05:44 - got
05:45 - Steamworks not sure what you mean by
05:47 - that uh the only person that needs
05:50 - Teamworks is the person uploading the
05:53 - the uploading the build but without that
05:56 - he can still work on the game so so yeah
05:58 - I'm not sure what you mean what when are
05:59 - you switching to gdau I definitely do
06:01 - want to try out gdau at some point so
06:03 - yeah no idea when but definitely
06:05 - something I have in my in my uh in my
06:08 - to-do list my very massive to-do list
06:10 - that is constantly very massive it's
06:12 - always way too big always got way too
06:13 - many things to do but yeah definitely do
06:15 - want to do same thing for making
06:17 - beginner tutorials more beginner
06:19 - tutorials more more tutorials in general
06:21 - all kinds of things so yeah definitely
06:22 - still want to uh do lots of things jaw
06:26 - exercises no not really as far as I know
06:28 - those don't really work so yeah that's a
06:31 - it's a not quite a thing yeah how' you
06:34 - learn to speak English quite simply by
06:36 - watching Cartoon Network that was kind
06:37 - of the well and by programming since
06:39 - everything related to programming is in
06:41 - English but yeah I spent a big portion
06:43 - of my childhood just watching Caron
06:45 - Network and it did have did not have any
06:47 - subtitles or anything like that so I was
06:48 - just watching I thought it was fun and I
06:50 - would learn a word here and there and
06:52 - eventually after while after spending a
06:55 - ton of time on the internet programming
06:56 - and so on so yeah basically just learned
06:58 - it
07:00 - uh let's say not intentionally so like I
07:03 - was constantly interacting with things
07:04 - in English and by that I sort of
07:06 - randomly learned and yeah by now
07:08 - honestly nowadays English
07:11 - Works my brain works more in English
07:13 - than it does in Portuguese which is kind
07:15 - of a fun thing kind of an interesting
07:16 - thing so yeah uh that's uh that's an
07:19 - interesting thing uh okay let me just uh
07:22 - read a bunch of things then get back to
07:24 - some your questions something like that
07:25 - and yeah last week I saw Deadpool and
07:27 - Wolverine pre fun movie that was quite
07:29 - nice I really enjoyed it I haven't seen
07:30 - a Marvel movie since like uh endgame so
07:34 - I haven't seen a Marvel movie in like 6
07:36 - years or something like that or I guess
07:38 - I saw that P to which I guess came out
07:40 - after that but anyways just saw it
07:42 - really interesting and it does make me
07:43 - make me think makes me want to build a
07:45 - game where the character Never Dies so
07:47 - how would you make a mechanic like that
07:48 - interesting cuz basically if the player
07:49 - character Never Dies then it's kind of
07:51 - hard to make it a compelling thing I
07:53 - mean if there's no loose condition then
07:54 - it's kind of hard to make a compelling
07:56 - experience out of that but yeah that's
07:58 - definitely an interesting G game design
07:59 - question how to make a game that somehow
08:02 - works when the player does not die so
08:04 - for example the enemies could keep
08:05 - moving uh after taking out the player so
08:07 - some kind of open world game so the
08:09 - player is I guess some kind of immortal
08:11 - vampire something like that and a bunch
08:13 - of enemies come in they take out the
08:14 - player and then the player just stays
08:16 - there on the floor while the enemies
08:17 - keep rolling around going on their on
08:20 - their own path on the open world I think
08:21 - it could be a fun one so basically the
08:23 - world exists outside of you so you pick
08:25 - a bunch of fights and the enemies take
08:26 - you out and eventually you come back to
08:28 - life and keep roaming around I think
08:30 - that could be an interesting one or
08:32 - simply just taking a score penalty when
08:34 - dying so just a simple one or maybe they
08:36 - don't die but lose all upgrades or items
08:38 - so definitely a bunch of interesting
08:40 - possibilities when it comes to building
08:42 - a game where the character does not die
08:43 - that could definitely be an if you're
08:46 - interested in a game design challenge
08:47 - then that's a a fun challenge try to
08:49 - make something
08:50 - where the the character Never Dies the
08:53 - player Never Dies and somehow find a way
08:55 - to make that compelling so yeah when you
08:58 - die the enemy level up their stats
09:00 - that's a bit of a tricky one cuz then
09:01 - becomes like a a snowball of difficulty
09:04 - so you die once then the enemies are
09:05 - more difficult increase the odds of you
09:07 - dying again which then and so on so yeah
09:10 - it could be interesting as long as you
09:11 - then have some sort of catch-up mechanic
09:13 - like in um uh what is it called Mario
09:15 - Kart where if you are way too far behind
09:17 - you get like a speed boost in order to
09:19 - make things semi- competitive so you
09:21 - could do something like that so like the
09:23 - every time you die the enemy levels up
09:24 - so the enemies become super strong but
09:26 - the stronger they get if that cap
09:27 - becomes way too big you can then give
09:29 - the players some kind of bonus some kind
09:30 - of special thing in order to catch up
09:32 - then when they catch up take away that
09:34 - bonus and things like that so that could
09:36 - be that could definitely be an uh a very
09:39 - interesting approach so yeah if you want
09:41 - the game design challenge this would be
09:42 - a fun one
09:45 - yeah6 will you update the 70 features
09:47 - course yep I'm constantly thinking about
09:49 - ways to update that course it's one of
09:51 - the many things that I'm constantly
09:53 - thinking about so yeah although not
09:55 - necessarily Rel to Unity 6 there are
09:56 - still many nonunity 6 uh featur that I
09:59 - very much would like to cover so yeah
10:03 - like for ex the navigation package that
10:04 - one has been that one has updated quite
10:06 - a while ago and I haven't yet looked
10:08 - into it so I definitely would like to
10:09 - make el on that same thing for sin
10:11 - machine because sin machine 3.0 just
10:13 - came out just a while ago
10:15 - actually like now when you install in
10:18 - machine it automatically installs 3.0
10:21 - which honestly is a bit annoying just
10:23 - because I'm already so used to using 2.0
10:25 - so I really like I already know how it
10:27 - works so just put it and everything
10:29 - works great so I really like s machine
10:31 - 2.0 but yeah definitely got to spend
10:33 - some time looking into 3.0 because 3.0
10:36 - is a massive update and apparently oh it
10:39 - was last year oh I thought it was a few
10:41 - months ago but no apparently 3.0 came
10:43 - out almost a year ago wow that is uh
10:46 - quite crazy yeah but yeah um so 2.9 got
10:50 - a last update in August of 22 and then
10:53 - yeah made 3.0 which is a massive change
10:56 - so yep anyways one of the many things I
10:58 - eventually would like to cover so that
10:59 - should be uh quite fun quite interesting
11:02 - yeah D two you're losing XP by dying
11:05 - really oh interesting I don't think I've
11:08 - ever played the Alum 2 I only played the
11:09 - Alum 3 so two yeah I don't think I've
11:11 - ever played two but yeah definitely
11:13 - definitely an interesting uh game okay
11:16 - so let's see and actually
11:18 - uh suddenly This Game Dev report starts
11:21 - out with a sort of a bummer news game
11:24 - inform forer ends after 33 years so it
11:26 - really really sucks but I mean for a new
11:29 - Sprint magazine to be alive still in
11:31 - 2024 that is honestly quite a quite an
11:33 - impressive thing but uh yeah so game
11:36 - form one of the most subscrib gaming
11:37 - magazines that started all the way back
11:39 - in ' 91 has just published its last
11:41 - issue and on the website they have just
11:43 - a farewell a bunch of messages 30 33
11:46 - years which is actually quite a lot for
11:48 - a for a news organization like that that
11:51 - was definitely a big one so yeah for the
11:54 - last three decades they provided
11:55 - in-depth coverage reviews and all sorts
11:57 - of insights into the game industry it
11:58 - was always a the big thing for a game to
12:00 - get covered on the front page of Game
12:01 - Informer which yeah I remember uh
12:03 - reading uh all kinds of news websites
12:06 - like I never I don't think game inform
12:08 - forer had a physical Edition here in
12:10 - Portugal so I'm pretty sure I've never
12:11 - seen a physical thing but I do remember
12:13 - reading websites like gamasutra and they
12:15 - would always uh mention okay this game
12:17 - has a really interesting thing on the
12:19 - cover Game Informer so yeah it was
12:21 - definitely a big thing although suddenly
12:23 - it appears website has been completely
12:24 - wiped and only has a fwell message I
12:27 - hope this is just a temporary thing
12:28 - because it's just happened hopefully in
12:30 - the future they will have the website
12:31 - back as a nice archive at least you can
12:33 - still find it on the way back machine so
12:35 - yeah this really sucks like they had so
12:36 - much information on the website but when
12:38 - they died it literally just end up just
12:40 - like this so just post a message no
12:42 - links no nothing although thankfully oh
12:45 - no oh oh crap did I not post the correct
12:49 - URL no I didn't it just this one kind of
12:52 - messed up the link address does it is
12:56 - the UTM yeah it's probably the UTM that
12:58 - breaks it
13:01 - are okay I think it's still yeah cuz
13:05 - this one had the website had so many
13:07 - things on there and thankfully does
13:08 - since it was a very popular website does
13:10 - have a lot of screenshots on the Wayback
13:12 - machine but yeah it definitely does suck
13:15 - how the official website just dead no
13:17 - memories no nothing so that really does
13:20 - suck so yeah that was a a
13:23 - thing why don't you reply on my comments
13:26 - I'm trying but trying to read reply to
13:28 - comments doing everything at the same
13:30 - time it's a bit tricky so I'm
13:32 - trying having a hard time getting better
13:35 - at programming C any tips I'm so poor I
13:37 - can't afford your course any tips I mean
13:38 - you can follow the if you're talking
13:40 - about the C course there are free videos
13:43 - over here on YouTube so learn
13:46 - C so if you want you can definitely
13:49 - follow this is the beginner one this is
13:53 - the uh intermediate one so you can go
13:55 - through those and eventually within what
13:57 - day is it 9 so around I don't know like
14:00 - 15 16 18 around this time maybe over
14:03 - here on a Monday so maybe on 19th of
14:05 - August I won't publish the video
14:06 - lectures for the advance section free
14:08 - here on YouTube so anyways even if you
14:10 - don't have any money you can definitely
14:11 - learn a lot from this and uh where was
14:14 - the
14:15 - comment and basically getting better
14:17 - just involves a looking through some
14:19 - tutorials in order to learn what does c
14:21 - do what can C do learn all the Syntax
14:23 - for all the things and uh hey yeah have
14:26 - fun at work yeah uh so first learn the
14:29 - syntax follow tutorials in order to
14:30 - learn that but then you have to actually
14:32 - apply it so when it comes to getting
14:34 - better at programming C or honestly
14:36 - literally anything you learn the thing
14:38 - and then you have to actually apply that
14:40 - thing so you have to write a bunch of
14:42 - code do a bunch of mini games a bunch of
14:43 - prototypes a bunch of mechanics a bunch
14:45 - of systems a bunch of random programs
14:47 - all kinds of things basically the more
14:48 - code you write the better you become so
14:50 - yeah learn how the code Works learn the
14:52 - syntax learn all of that and then spend
14:54 - some time actually putting that into
14:56 - practice I mean that is a big reason why
14:58 - in the course I to find the the uh the
15:00 - uh interactive exercises it was
15:02 - specifically for that so you can
15:03 - actually learn by doing and those
15:04 - interactive exercis those are a crap the
15:06 - ads those are part of the uh premium
15:09 - version of the course but over here on
15:11 - the free version I still made sure to
15:13 - include all the titles for all the
15:14 - exercise let me just skip
15:17 - this so at the end of every single one
15:20 - there you go it shows this thing so you
15:22 - can okay this one doesn't have size
15:24 - let's go over there onto the variables
15:26 - one there you go so if you don't have
15:29 - the premium version you can just look at
15:31 - these titles and you can basically do do
15:33 - some work yourself in order to figure
15:34 - out the answers to all these so what
15:36 - exactly is a variable why data typ is
15:37 - important you can do some kind of
15:39 - exercise to change a unit speed so
15:40 - change some kind of variable define a
15:42 - speed variable double some kind of
15:44 - variable and so on so even without
15:45 - paying anything you can just watch these
15:47 - three videos guide yourself to do all
15:49 - this work enter all the fqs do some
15:52 - exercise quiz but essentially at the end
15:54 - of the day it's really only about
15:55 - experience so the more code you write
15:56 - the better you become so write a ton of
15:58 - code and you w become quite a bit better
16:00 - so in general that's what I would
16:04 - say prob work your free course are
16:06 - probably best s that's awesome hey I'm
16:08 - glad people enjoy the courses and yeah
16:11 - as long as people keep enjoying them I
16:12 - will definitely keep making them so
16:14 - that's nice uh how long did it take you
16:17 - to plan out the code structure for the
16:19 - RTS do Score says Rook I'm amazed how
16:21 - you came out with Solutions i' never
16:24 - uh two months
16:27 - maybe yeah yeah something like that a
16:29 - month and a half to two months something
16:31 - like that was how long it took me to
16:32 - build the Prototype so basically first I
16:34 - had to spend a bunch of time myself
16:36 - learning learning all about dots so
16:38 - reading reading the entire documentation
16:40 - reading all of their they have a really
16:41 - awesome dots ebook Unity dos
16:45 - ebook and I think it's this one yeah
16:47 - like a 50 page ebook so I definitely
16:50 - recommend uh it's over here the link no
16:53 - it's not that it's this one yeah so a
16:55 - really nice ebook telling all about dots
16:57 - so I spent a bunch of time going through
16:58 - this I spent a bunch of time reading
17:00 - documentation spent a b bunch of time uh
17:03 - watching all the videos on dots that I
17:05 - could find on YouTube all kinds of
17:06 - things then of course like I was saying
17:08 - a while ago at some point you have to
17:09 - put into practice so I did all that all
17:11 - that research in order to learn how it
17:12 - works then I started building a
17:13 - prototype so I started experimenting
17:15 - with a ton of approaches and yeah
17:17 - eventually I did find the final
17:20 - structure but again keep in mind
17:21 - whenever you watch one of my tutorials
17:23 - or really any kind of code any kind of
17:25 - game whenever you see that keep in mind
17:27 - that you are watching you are looking at
17:29 - the final version of that thing so for
17:31 - example when you look at my dots scor
17:35 - the code that I'm teaching there is not
17:37 - the code that I initially came up on the
17:38 - first R so I first make a prototype get
17:40 - it working and then I iterate upon it I
17:42 - modify all kinds of things until finally
17:44 - reaching the final thing so basically
17:45 - what you are watching is essentially
17:47 - like version I don't know 30 or 40 of
17:50 - the initial code that I first did so so
17:53 - I never plan out the code perfectly from
17:55 - the beginning I plan out something I
17:57 - start building prototype start building
17:58 - something and then just constantly
18:00 - iterating upon it until it finally
18:01 - reaches something that is uh pretty nice
18:04 - yeah first stream C vis a ton nice yeah
18:07 - I'm GL my vide home nice so yeah that is
18:10 - uh awesome okay so let me uh just keep
18:13 - reading okay so yeah on the topic of
18:16 - game forer which is I guess a positive
18:18 - way to look at it is how it's actually
18:20 - amazing that they last this long so
18:21 - really three decades on a print magazine
18:23 - especially considering how YouTube has
18:25 - grown so much so yeah nowadays there's
18:27 - excellent stuff on YouTube so review
18:29 - channels like game ranks interview
18:30 - channels like no clip and deep dive
18:32 - channels like Ai and games so yeah if
18:34 - you want to learn I definitely recommend
18:36 - at least e like Ai and games this is a
18:38 - really awesome Channel they've got such
18:41 - super detailed uh videos specifically on
18:45 - on AI so like the one on fear that one
18:47 - is really awesome there was one on the
18:49 - AI in Watch Dogs and Legion I think it
18:51 - was that was really awesome so yeah a
18:53 - lot of excellent uh videos if you want
18:55 - to learn all about Ai and no clip of
18:57 - course if you want to see documentaries
18:59 - really well produced documentaries and
19:01 - yeah coming soon design of dredge so
19:03 - that's an awesome game so that should be
19:04 - a fun one so yeah if you like watching
19:06 - uh uh game documentaries then definitely
19:10 - recommend this channel definitely really
19:11 - nice so yeah here in Portal we didn't
19:13 - have Game Informer but I do have for
19:15 - memories of reading a few Mega scores so
19:17 - yeah this was like the uh local thing
19:20 - meas score magazine can I find some
19:24 - images nope ah
19:29 - oh not store score there you go nice
19:33 - local magazine a bunch of games oh that
19:36 - was the heart dark that was nice that
19:38 - was a fun one yeah a bunch of stuff
19:40 - that's what Tomb Raider legend oh that
19:42 - one nice so yeah so this was the local
19:45 - magazine here in Portugal uh for a long
19:48 - time and B Gamer that was another one
19:49 - that was also that was also fun so yeah
19:51 - anyways here we did not have gameing
19:53 - form but we did have that and yeah I
19:55 - remember being a maaz reading an article
19:56 - for an upcoming game where the graphics
19:58 - look in wishable from real life and it
20:00 - was the eldest Scrolls for Oblivion and
20:02 - yeah it's really funny how uh I mean I
20:05 - don't know how many of you are roughly
20:07 - my age but yeah when I was a kid and
20:08 - looking at games I definitely didn't
20:10 - look at a game like this and I thought
20:11 - there's no way this this can be better
20:13 - there's no way this game can ever look
20:15 - better than this uh steam power.com
20:19 - because yeah it really is a I mean
20:22 - nowadays looking at it you can obviously
20:23 - see that this looks quite dated but back
20:27 - then this looked insanely realistic I
20:28 - remember looking at it and thinking holy
20:31 - crap I wish I had a PC that was able to
20:32 - run this this looks so beautiful so
20:34 - perfect look at that oh man Oblivion
20:37 - that was a really awesome game I did
20:39 - play it for quite a long time I
20:41 - definitely did all the side quests
20:43 - everything so yeah definitely an amazing
20:45 - game it was quite impressive uh how good
20:48 - it looked back then so yeah this came
20:50 - out in 2K7 yeah quite a long time ago
20:54 - and back then it did look quite amazing
20:56 - so yeah it's uh it's a shame game forer
20:59 - shut down but yeah nowadays there's lots
21:01 - of places to get uh lots of news lots of
21:04 - things so yeah that should be uh
21:08 - fun think of the illen isolation of alen
21:11 - I see that it's Prett genus I've never
21:13 - actually played it just because it's
21:14 - sort of a horror game and I don't do
21:17 - well with horror but I definitely do
21:18 - need to play it just to uh check out the
21:21 - AI and I'm pretty sure that Ai and games
21:23 - I'm pretty sure uh he did a video on it
21:26 - so um let's go alien I'm pretty sure
21:30 - there was yeah there you go alien a
21:33 - alien isolation so yeah I think it was
21:34 - actually no I thought it was one of his
21:36 - first videos but apparently not 15 but
21:39 - yeah I definitely remember apparently
21:40 - saw this video so this one was probably
21:42 - awesome so yeah I've never played it but
21:45 - it does look quite amazing and it's
21:47 - especially great from the context of
21:50 - being in AI that makes the player feel
21:52 - things so it's not an AI that is like
21:54 - insanely clever but rather it is really
21:56 - good at making you think that it is
21:57 - extremely clever so yeah if you want to
21:59 - look at awesome AI definitely do play
22:02 - the game uh watch this and yeah it's uh
22:06 - definitely one of the ones that is
22:08 - usually given out as the example of okay
22:10 - this is excellent top tier AI definitely
22:13 - do
22:14 - that for dynamic typing or static typing
22:17 - me personally I really dislike VAR now
22:20 - again whenever I say this I have to say
22:21 - that's really just personal preference
22:23 - there is absolutely nothing wrong with
22:24 - VAR so if you like VAR definitely go
22:26 - ahead and use it but yeah for me
22:27 - personally I I really do not like VAR
22:29 - just because I think it makes the code
22:31 - much less readable I like V yeah that's
22:34 - oh hey Daniel it's you hey how's it
22:35 - going uh yeah personally I really
22:37 - dislike VAR just because usually it
22:40 - makes it it makes it not well I guess
22:43 - not usually it depends on how you're
22:44 - using it like if you're using VAR as
22:46 - like grabbing a a variable that is a
22:48 - return of some kind of function I really
22:50 - dislike the fact that most of the times
22:52 - I cannot tell what type that thing is so
22:54 - I'm calling some function I have no idea
22:55 - what the function returns just by
22:57 - looking at the function name so I have
22:58 - no idea what type that thing will be so
23:00 - that is why personally I really like
23:02 - being extremely explicit so I really
23:03 - like saying okay this is a type in it's
23:05 - a list of object it's a game object that
23:07 - say something so yeah personally I
23:10 - really don't like bar I really like
23:12 - being extremely explicit about what
23:14 - types I'm using it but there that's
23:16 - really just personal preference so
23:17 - there's absolutely nothing wrong with
23:19 - VAR so if you like using definitely use
23:21 - it but me personally I won't keep being
23:23 - as explicit as possible because yeah I
23:25 - definitely do prefer reading the code
23:27 - like that yeah
23:29 - speak to in private you can send me an
23:31 - email but lately I've been getting way
23:33 - too many emails so that is quite
23:35 - tricking feels like you're playing with
23:37 - an alien in not a dum AI yeah I mean
23:39 - that that is that right there is the
23:41 - perfect description of what an excellent
23:44 - AI is like you forget that you're
23:45 - actually playing against a computer
23:46 - opponent you're just really enjoying
23:48 - something that is compelling you're just
23:52 - enjoying a very compelling experience
23:54 - and not worrying about okay there's some
23:55 - code running background no it's really a
23:57 - creature that is actually attacking me
23:59 - so yeah kind of like that why to improve
24:02 - my channel uh maybe I'll check it out
24:03 - later okay is n6 fully released nope
24:06 - right now it is still in the what do
24:08 - they call it preview so yeah not yet but
24:11 - it should be coming out later this year
24:13 - I'm assuming it won be coming out
24:16 - sometime around uh
24:19 - unite which by the way I will actually
24:21 - be at unite so if any of you are coming
24:23 - to Barcelona I willon be there so go
24:25 - ahead let me know it should be a fun
24:28 - time so there's a bunch of things and
24:29 - they've actually just published the
24:31 - session list so if you want to see all
24:33 - of the sessions they're going to have
24:36 - all things like one on accelerating the
24:38 - creation of your competitive multiplayer
24:39 - game okay achieve your vision faster
24:41 - with technical ARS tools and un6 so yep
24:44 - they've already published uh all of the
24:46 - uh talks they're going to have so if
24:49 - you're going to uh unite definitely
24:51 - check that out and if you see me there
24:52 - yeah come come ahead and say hi Oh
24:54 - Daniel you're doing a talk nice that's
24:56 - cool yeah I will definitely go there
24:58 - what is it about can I find it
25:00 - here if I search for your name does it
25:02 - show
25:03 - up uh there you go connecting dots let's
25:06 - make a game with entities okay that
25:09 - sounds fun that sounds nice fors
25:11 - fundamentals to entities 1.3 give you a
25:14 - bird's eye view of the API landscape
25:16 - today through a Hands-On live tutorial
25:17 - with ECS s will Empower you to explore
25:20 - the API and build the confidence to
25:21 - continue your ECS development Journey
25:23 - all right that sounds awesome yeah I'll
25:24 - definitely be there that is definitely a
25:26 - a topic that I'm interested in so yeah
25:28 - should be fun yeah I hope you're
25:30 - preparing well should be nice definitely
25:33 - looking forward to it Peak Performance
25:34 - okay that's a that's a great theme that
25:36 - should be fun hey the qus hey how's it
25:38 - going
25:40 - right uh was I
25:43 - yeah
25:45 - uh uh okay let what oh let's see I
25:49 - thought the page was cut off but
25:51 - something like
25:52 - that mind the Observer and facade
25:55 - patterns in my project instead of having
25:56 - scripts communicate with each other
25:57 - directly
25:58 - interact through a single script that
26:00 - serves as a facade class what do you
26:02 - think of this
26:04 - approach uh when it comes to names of
26:06 - design patterns that is always something
26:08 - that confused me so the facade pattern
26:10 - I'm not 100% sure I remember what
26:12 - exactly that is is that like an
26:14 - interface so you have like an interface
26:17 - and with the Observer pattern you are
26:18 - communicating with the interface instead
26:20 - of each other directly just a wrapper
26:24 - okay so I guess I just don't understand
26:27 - exactly what you're doing so you've got
26:28 - the Observer pattern which is really
26:29 - just events so you're publishing
26:31 - something listening to something so then
26:33 - you've got the sound pattern so you're
26:35 - using some kind of some kind of thing to
26:41 - the okay so I'm not sure how you're
26:43 - using it but single script to
26:45 - communicate with oh so you got like a
26:48 - main event manager and then you are like
26:51 - uh listening to that main event manager
26:53 - instead of having different objects
26:54 - listening to them themselves is that
26:56 - what you mean if so that can definitely
26:58 - be a valid approach uh personally I do
27:01 - prefer to register directly with the
27:03 - event but yep having an event manager
27:05 - and basically anyone that listens to
27:06 - events talks to that one and anyone that
27:08 - publishes events talks to that one
27:10 - basically you have an intermediary in
27:11 - between those twoos that can also work
27:13 - so yeah personally normally I usually
27:15 - just connect to the event publisher
27:17 - directly but having the event manager in
27:19 - the middle that can also work uh quite a
27:21 - bit getand does a lot of good videos on
27:23 - patterns nice and yeah actually speaking
27:25 - of patterns one of the things that if uh
27:27 - that I want to cover in a little bit is
27:29 - Unity actually has an excellent uh
27:32 - little uh project that they put out on
27:34 - the assur alongside a really nice uh uh
27:38 - what's it called really nice ebook and
27:40 - yeah talks about solid principles design
27:42 - patterns so yeah in a little bit I want
27:44 - to I want to go through this and just in
27:47 - case you I'm pretty sure I had a tab
27:49 - here nope not that one nope nope nope
27:52 - there you go that one so if you want
27:54 - Unity has that awesome one so yep
27:58 - definitely do this a great ebook it's
28:00 - quite amazing how un has so many awesome
28:02 - ebooks so much information so yeah if
28:04 - you read through all those ebooks you're
28:06 - definitely going to learn quite a bit
28:07 - and uh yeah this one is actually uh
28:10 - quite an amazing
28:12 - thing uh yeah problem I forgot coding
28:15 - syntax how they are declared is my
28:17 - memory problem by me do you mean like
28:20 - you forget the syntax for C sure if it's
28:23 - a basic syntax like how do I Define a
28:24 - function yeah that's just something you
28:26 - learn with the experience so the
28:28 - definitely just write more code that is
28:30 - usually so kind of like the question
28:32 - that I was answering a while ago the
28:33 - answer is really experienced so really
28:35 - just write a ton of code and eventually
28:37 - it becomes Supernatural this is how you
28:39 - define a function this is how you define
28:40 - a variable property class whatever so
28:43 - yeah when it comes to basic syntax it's
28:44 - really just a basic memorization but
28:47 - when it comes to problem solving every
28:49 - problem is always different so when it
28:50 - comes to problem solving it is not about
28:52 - memorizing Solutions it's about becoming
28:54 - better at problem solving but then when
28:56 - it comes to syntax sure memorize that
28:58 - and in a little bit you should be able
28:59 - to memorize quite a lot of things yeah
29:02 - okay let me just uh keep going because
29:04 - there's actually quite a lot of
29:05 - interesting things so yeah the second
29:07 - story is start small and stay small and
29:10 - actually about a really interesting red
29:11 - post on a topic that I personally very
29:13 - much agree with so that is the post is
29:15 - titled why I absolutely love making
29:17 - small games and why you should do it too
29:20 - so the goal is start with a small scope
29:21 - making small games so that's really
29:22 - common device but then keep doing
29:24 - exactly that so you don't have to
29:26 - graduate to making multi-year games
29:28 - making multimon games you can really
29:30 - keep the scope small and really just
29:31 - keep building fun small games forever so
29:33 - this is definitely advice that I really
29:35 - like uh because
29:37 - personally at least for me it doesn't
29:39 - really I don't find it very appealing to
29:41 - spend like five years making a game I
29:42 - really much prefer making five games in
29:44 - 5 years as opposed to just trying to go
29:45 - from one massive one all at the same
29:47 - time some people really prefer that I do
29:49 - think that is a much more high risk
29:51 - potentially High reward option so
29:53 - personally I do prefer the slightly low
29:55 - risk of making five games in 5 years cuz
29:57 - then you have essentially five uh five
30:00 - chances at making a game that does find
30:02 - success so personally I definitely do
30:04 - prefer this advice of small scope making
30:07 - small games and really just stay there
30:08 - so you don't have to graduate to making
30:10 - multi-e games you can just always keep
30:12 - making small games and this example this
30:14 - post written by one developers behind
30:16 - minim Lane so that's a really nice cozy
30:17 - game that has been very successful and
30:20 - he mentions a bunch of benefits and one
30:21 - of the main benefits is simply cost so
30:23 - basically if you spend 5 months working
30:24 - on a game you'll likely just need a
30:26 - couple hundred or a few thousand cop
30:28 - sold to break even whereas if you work
30:29 - in a game for 5 years you'll likely need
30:31 - tens of thousands of sales which is
30:32 - really tricky to achieve so yeah the
30:35 - faster you make your games the more
30:37 - efficient you are the more smaller scope
30:38 - you make it the much easier it is to
30:40 - make profitable games so not just finish
30:43 - the game but actually make the game and
30:45 - being able to make enough money so you
30:46 - can make the next game and so on so yeah
30:48 - that is one big reason why small games
30:51 - are really awesome and making multiple
30:53 - smaller games also helps you T out lots
30:55 - of ideas and maybe one that people
30:58 - enjoyed where you can spend more time
30:59 - working on a sequel so you can put out
31:01 - tons of games in like every 6 months
31:04 - then one of those maybe people really uh
31:06 - Vibe with that idea they really like it
31:08 - then he can take that one and he can
31:09 - spend let's say one extra year working
31:12 - on either a SQL building upon it
31:13 - something like that because basically it
31:15 - is really difficult to find something
31:17 - that scks something that resonates with
31:18 - a large amount of people so that it can
31:20 - be successful so if you do find
31:21 - something like that then yeah definitely
31:23 - working on it pushing it Forward I do
31:25 - think that is a uh an excellent strategy
31:27 - so use this make small games to test out
31:29 - ideas and then if you want if you really
31:31 - want to make a game that is like a
31:33 - multi-year game then at least I would
31:34 - say test out lots of ideas to find out
31:37 - one that does have the potential to find
31:39 - success when you make it for multiple
31:41 - years so yeah the post very well written
31:43 - explaining lots of benefits of this
31:44 - approach definitely give it a read and
31:46 - yeah this one does have it's a Prem
31:48 - massive post it's all really nice so
31:50 - yeah this one is from the developer of
31:52 - minim M which was actually a very
31:54 - successful game look at that 2.9 th000
31:56 - reviews this is one of those cozy games
31:59 - you run the street and it's all really
32:01 - nice and it has really beautiful colors
32:04 - so it definitely is Chill cozy Vibes
32:07 - just have some fun characters some fun
32:09 - things so
32:11 - yeah sometimes hard to think of small
32:13 - ideas well the main one for that is
32:15 - really just think of not a big idea but
32:17 - think of a normalized idea and then just
32:20 - break it apart into pieces so like for
32:21 - example this game maybe the big idea
32:23 - would be something like Sim City where
32:25 - you have an entire city with tons of
32:26 - NPCs and you talk to all of them so this
32:28 - could be an example of a small scope out
32:30 - of that big idea so basically you take
32:32 - the entire city and you cut it down okay
32:34 - no I'm just going to make just one
32:36 - single uh Road of this city so really
32:39 - just a handful of buildings instead of
32:40 - building the entire city just build that
32:42 - so when it comes to making small ideas
32:45 - think of a normalized idea and then just
32:47 - break it apart into all the pieces and
32:49 - really just make something much much
32:50 - smaller very focused so instead of
32:52 - making something with 100 mechanics
32:54 - focus on just five of those and make
32:56 - those work really well so
32:58 - that is probably a a great way to come
33:01 - up with small ideas so think of
33:02 - something like GTA and then think okay
33:04 - no I'm just going to make the the
33:06 - driving I'm just going to make missions
33:07 - I'm just going to make like a poli
33:09 - Simulator game like a uh what do you
33:12 - call them like the ambulance game sort
33:13 - of thing like GTA is a huge game has all
33:16 - those mini games and each of those mini
33:17 - games could by themselves be uh one
33:19 - complete game so yep start Le game
33:22 - development St learning coding one week
33:24 - ago nice yeah that's cool have month to
33:27 - prepare for my university project okay
33:29 - wow that that took a turn that took a
33:32 - jump you started learning one week ago
33:34 - and you have one month to prepare for
33:36 - university project okay I feel like it's
33:39 - missing a little bit there but okay how
33:41 - should I start and from where and how
33:43 - could I learn okay so if you want to
33:45 - learn where's my tab where's my tab uh
33:49 - definitely check out my uh where's my
33:52 - cuz I didn't call it kitchen
33:54 - cows watch my there you go my free
33:58 - kitchen chaos course definitely go ahead
34:00 - and watch that it's 10 hours so
34:03 - technically you won't really be able to
34:05 - learn all of that in just one month but
34:08 - you'll be able to gain quite a bit of
34:09 - knowledge so that's what I would say but
34:11 - yeah one month for university project I
34:13 - have no idea how complex that university
34:14 - project is but yeah not sure how you
34:17 - start coding just a week ago and
34:19 - suddenly have just one month to prepare
34:20 - so yeah that won't be uh quite
34:25 - something anyone can give a g idea how
34:27 - do you generate a good game idea had
34:29 - this question in my head forever can you
34:30 - give some tips I do I love your vide so
34:31 - much nice and that is a very tricky
34:35 - question that is essentially the million
34:37 - dollar question so if you have a way to
34:39 - guarantee that you have good ideas then
34:41 - you would basically print money because
34:44 - the idea is such an important thing when
34:46 - it comes to a game being successful or
34:47 - not so when it comes to that the basic
34:49 - idea or I guess the better way is come
34:52 - up with a ton of ideas and then
34:54 - depending on your knowledge you have to
34:56 - be able to analyze what EX makes a good
34:58 - idea and how do you do that is
34:59 - essentially you just look at the uh
35:02 - steam page you go and see what sells so
35:05 - basically you see for them down here new
35:07 - and trending so you go over here and you
35:09 - see all of these games so all of these
35:11 - that are on the popular new release all
35:12 - of these are doing at least decently
35:14 - well so you come up with 100 ideas and
35:17 - then you study this page you refresh it
35:19 - every single day in order to see what
35:20 - games sell what people want to play and
35:23 - then with that over time you get a
35:24 - better sense for what kind of games can
35:27 - sell and specifically what kind of level
35:30 - of quality the average person on team is
35:32 - expecting so as you can see the the uh
35:35 - competition is definitely very Fierce so
35:37 - the amount of games look at these
35:38 - awesome games coming out literally every
35:40 - single day what is that knock on coffin
35:42 - oh a card game with vampires I guess
35:45 - anyways so yeah lots of variety all of
35:47 - them is really awesome so that is
35:49 - something that you learn over time as
35:51 - you analyze so meaning not just play but
35:54 - actually analyze okay why is this game
35:55 - being successful as you analyze that you
35:58 - get better yourself at being able to
35:59 - identify what is a decent idea versus an
36:02 - excellent idea but at that point but
36:05 - even if you do that you still don't have
36:06 - a guarantee of a good idea so then what
36:08 - you do next is you really just test out
36:10 - the idea by there are many ways but one
36:14 - of the easiest well easiest quote
36:16 - unquote is basically make a bunch of
36:18 - gifts a bunch of short videos and just
36:20 - put them on Tik Tok Reddit Twitter
36:22 - whatever just make a bunch of tiny
36:25 - things put them out and see what the
36:26 - reaction is like if you post on Twitter
36:28 - and you get zero likes that might be an
36:31 - indicator it might be an indicator that
36:33 - either the idea is not very compelling
36:35 - or it might be an indicator that you
36:37 - simply were unlik and then reach that's
36:38 - the issue where with testing you can't
36:41 - fully test you can only slightly test so
36:44 - essentially if you put it out on Twitter
36:45 - and you get 10,000 views on a brand new
36:47 - account that is definitely a clear sign
36:49 - that there is uh interest in that idea
36:52 - same thing if you go and redit if you go
36:54 - on take it out and so on if you make a
36:55 - Tik Tok short video basically a
36:57 - prototype your game like a mini visual
36:59 - vertical slice if you do that and goes
37:01 - viral then you know okay this idea
37:03 - definitely has something on the other
37:04 - hand if you put it and gets like 10
37:06 - views that probably uh means it doesn't
37:09 - have way too much so yeah when it comes
37:11 - to testing ideas first uh grow your own
37:15 - skills of being able to analyze what the
37:17 - what sells on steam or uh I guess what
37:19 - players want to want to buy for me
37:21 - personally I work mainly on seam so
37:23 - that's my focus or but you can say what
37:25 - sells on seam what sells on mobile what
37:27 - sells on console something like that so
37:29 - develop that thing and then come up with
37:31 - a bunch of ideas and test them out so uh
37:34 - that's how I would do
37:37 - it l oh yeah for mixing uh ideas yeah
37:41 - good artist Copic great arst steal best
37:43 - artist steal for multiple sources to
37:44 - high tracks yeah basically combine
37:46 - multiple things so yeah if you want to
37:49 - if you want an idea that has better odds
37:50 - of finding success yeah definitely take
37:52 - two already successful games and come up
37:54 - with your own uh mish mash of that gen
37:57 - def
37:58 - uh do something like that so yeah com L
38:00 - buying a 5x P plus hard valy yep all of
38:04 - those three very successful games so
38:06 - that is quite nice try to make a game
38:08 - development Studio or do you prefer solo
38:10 - I'm really not good at managing people
38:12 - so yeah for me making a proper game
38:14 - development Studio probably never going
38:16 - to make that although who knows perhaps
38:18 - one day in the future I will work at a
38:21 - studio meaning I will not be the one in
38:23 - charge I will just be working alongside
38:25 - other people maybe that could be fun but
38:27 - but yeah uh building my own Studio being
38:31 - in charge of building my own Studio yeah
38:32 - that that requires way too many
38:34 - management skills which is definitely
38:36 - not the kind of skills that I have so
38:38 - yeah that is uh and yeah game studio is
38:41 - slowly dying off because they can't make
38:42 - enough money making games anymore that
38:44 - is also one of my benefits of being a
38:45 - Sol developer I really don't need that
38:47 - much money in order to make a living
38:49 - whereas if I was a studio with like 10
38:51 - developers to pay all of a sudden even
38:53 - small games become really expensive and
38:55 - need to sell tens of thousands of copies
38:57 - whereas as for example on my own thing
38:58 - like I talked about the results for
39:00 - dinky Guardians so this is looking at
39:03 - the reviews this is a pretty regular
39:06 - game it's definitely not a hit game
39:07 - definitely not a hyper success but
39:09 - definitely more than enough for me to uh
39:11 - pay my wages pay my living so yeah being
39:14 - a Sol developer or a small scale
39:15 - developer also makes it much easier to
39:17 - make profitable games although of course
39:19 - that doesn't mean that I have to do all
39:21 - the work so pros and cons kind of like
39:23 - that the 20 Game Challenge yeah I just
39:25 - heard about it recently and actually
39:27 - really awesome one and uh yep there you
39:30 - go this one it's really awesome a really
39:33 - excellent
39:34 - idea uh I was told about it from someone
39:36 - on the private Discord uh a while ago
39:40 - and it's really awesome basically it's
39:41 - the idea of building a ton of simple
39:43 - games well simple two complex games just
39:46 - build a ton of games specifically 20
39:48 - games and you will learn quite a lot so
39:50 - I definitely do do think this is an
39:52 - awesome thing so yeah if you're looking
39:54 - for challenges for games to make
39:56 - definitely look at this one building
39:58 - simple games or not even simple building
40:00 - any kind of game is always going to give
40:02 - you a ton of experience a ton of
40:04 - knowledge so yeah definitely a big fan
40:07 - of this concept and yeah honestly my
40:11 - long-term plan is to eventually have
40:13 - video tutorials on making a bunch of
40:14 - these simple games I would love to do
40:16 - that so I would love to have a free
40:18 - 2hour course on making pong another one
40:20 - on making FL bird making breakout uh
40:23 - asteroids that's an awesome one lunar
40:25 - lander that is really cool uh Mario Bros
40:28 - just just a basic one but worms that
40:30 - would be fun that would be nice super M
40:33 - that would be cool making Doom Maybe
40:36 - Minecraft yeah that could be interesting
40:38 - and yeah so yeah if you're looking for
40:40 - uh basic games to to build to grow your
40:42 - skills definitely go ahead follow this
40:45 - uh this uh website which has a really
40:48 - nice list of nice simple games to to do
40:51 - so
40:53 - yeah I don't Ser too personal but would
40:56 - your games provide enough in come for
40:57 - you alone not including YouTube Etc yep
40:59 - I mean I did make my games for how long
41:03 - I started this channel in 2018 and I
41:06 - started making my first theme game in
41:09 - 2013 so I guess for five or six years uh
41:13 - yeah I was making a living just from my
41:15 - game so yeah specifically for my use
41:18 - case specifically for living here in
41:19 - Portugal where uh in the beginning when
41:22 - I first moved out when I first started
41:24 - Living on my own I was living on like
41:26 - €750 a month so yeah I could essentially
41:30 - make a game in one year and make more
41:32 - than like seven Grand off of it so yep
41:35 - thanks to having very low cost yep I was
41:38 - definitely able to uh make a living from
41:40 - my games hey CPU hey how's it going
41:44 - nice uh new project would you prefer
41:47 - Unity 6 or previous
41:48 - versions considering how Unity 6 the
41:51 - proper final version is almost out about
41:53 - to come out I'm guessing it's going to
41:54 - come out like I was saying a while ago
41:56 - it's probably going going to come out
41:57 - during unite which is going to be in uh
42:00 - when is it I was tab uh unite is going
42:05 - to uh there you go late September so I'm
42:08 - guessing around this uh time they are
42:11 - going to either publish unit6 final
42:14 - version or give a date for it so yeah if
42:16 - I were starting a project right now yep
42:18 - I would definitely use the current un6
42:20 - version and then upgrade to the LTS
42:22 - version whenever that one does come out
42:24 - so yeah that should be
42:27 - it should be nice in what could case in
42:31 - what case should you buy assets well in
42:33 - the case that you need something that
42:35 - you probably can't do uh can't do
42:39 - yourself so in my case I am not an
42:41 - artist so for me when it comes to visual
42:43 - stuff yeah I'm just going to buy assets
42:45 - I'm just going to buy animations
42:47 - textures visuals so yeah you can use
42:50 - assets either to supplement your skill
42:51 - set so basically help you fill any kind
42:53 - of skill apps you have or essentially
42:55 - really just you okay I do have the skill
42:58 - set of being able to make like some kind
42:59 - of pathfinding system but making a
43:01 - proper one is going to take a ton of
43:02 - time so let me just buy an asset and
43:04 - just save a ton of time so yep either
43:06 - play skill Maps or save time those can
43:08 - be great
43:10 - ways oh reply to you okay yeah I'll
43:12 - check it out in Li yeah thanks for your
43:14 - reply I'm definitely interested in
43:16 - hearing more about that conversation
43:18 - seeing different viewpoints definitely
43:19 - an interesting topic
43:22 - uh about way more project management I
43:25 - don't make too much project
43:28 - management uh specifically talking about
43:30 - in the context of like making uh game
43:32 - design documents usually I don't do
43:34 - anything too complex I just make some
43:37 - simple high level overviews and very
43:38 - quickly start building a prototype so
43:40 - that is usually how I do it so nothing
43:42 - too insane I don't make like 20 Page 20
43:45 - pages of designs and making uml diagrams
43:48 - connecting this and that usually I don't
43:49 - do that just make something simple hand
43:51 - L overview and then just start start
43:54 - building a prototype and really iterate
43:55 - from there so yeah when it comes you
43:58 - project management in that sense of
44:00 - Designing the entire game just design a
44:01 - little bit and then constantly itate
44:03 - upon let make a horror game I very much
44:07 - in theory I would like to just because
44:09 - just to test out the the uh uh the
44:12 - theory that uh Chris has said multiple
44:15 - times uh Chris over here yeah why every
44:18 - Indie Dev should make horror game so I
44:20 - would like to try out that theory to see
44:21 - if horror games really do have a
44:24 - relatively easier time of Finding
44:26 - Traction
44:27 - and relatively easier time of actual
44:29 - building game so from that so as an
44:31 - experiment I would like to do it but
44:34 - yeah I am not a fan of of playing horror
44:36 - games so that would be a very
44:38 - interesting one like can someone who
44:40 - does not like horror games build a good
44:42 - horror game I guess that's an
44:44 - interesting question but yeah eventually
44:46 - I very much uh would like to experiment
44:49 - with that that would be
44:51 - fun code question I get the same
44:54 - transform from the children of a parent
44:56 - in my queries not having a parent works
44:58 - but how do you get the transform of a
45:00 - child in dots so in dots for all the
45:02 - children those are all if you look at
45:04 - the parent uh not game object for the
45:07 - parent entity it's going to have an
45:09 - array it's actually a dynamic buffer uh
45:11 - it's called CH or something like that I
45:14 - think it's like the child array and
45:16 - inside it's it's an array so it's an
45:17 - element that contains all of the uh
45:20 - children
45:22 - so yeah not having a parent words how
45:24 - you get the transform of a child yeah so
45:26 - then you can cycle through all those
45:27 - entities then on those entities you can
45:29 - access the local transform which is
45:30 - going to have the local values and then
45:32 - it just becomes a little bit tricky if
45:34 - you want to convert those local vales
45:35 - into Global although I think that the uh
45:38 - the local transform I think that one
45:39 - does have a function in order to
45:41 - basically do that mat convert a local
45:43 - transform into Global so yeah
45:45 - essentially that cycle through that
45:46 - component that uh Dynamic buffer and it
45:50 - should be uh quite
45:53 - nice nor only BR s of horr ask uh it's
45:55 - more stry it's more well it's as much
45:58 - horror as some like XCOM I guess which
46:01 - yeah does have some pretty scary zombies
46:03 - but doesn't have any like like in yourr
46:06 - face uh scary flashing things so yeah
46:10 - it's definitely more strategy than
46:11 - horror but yeah I guess it does have
46:13 - zombies so ores is your Fitness going do
46:16 - you see any improvements yeah it's going
46:18 - pretty nice I mean just uh just a while
46:20 - ago I did a really nice challenge where
46:22 - I did a bike ride for 127 km so that was
46:25 - fun I spent like 8 hours on a bike going
46:28 - nice and chill nice and relaxing so yeah
46:30 - that was fun spending an entire day on a
46:32 - bike that was definitely an interesting
46:35 - really really nice one and uh yeah just
46:38 - a while ago I hit my my bench PR of 120
46:42 - kilos that was fun and just like early
46:44 - this week I was doing 110 kilos and it
46:46 - was pretty easy to do five reps so yeah
46:49 - hopefully hit a new PR uh sometime soon
46:51 - so that should be that should be fun um
46:57 - okay so yeah so on the just read the TDR
47:00 - so again I really recommend you watch uh
47:04 - oh is this oh wow this one has a limit
47:07 - does it yep it does have a limit so I
47:09 - can't post such a long link that's funny
47:12 - that's
47:13 - funny uh uh so yeah really great post on
47:18 - making small games and why you should do
47:19 - it too again that is also very much my
47:22 - advice start small and continue small
47:24 - Ione like it so T what time you have on
47:26 - your personal funds better to make a few
47:28 - games than make no game or making just
47:30 - one giant game so basically if you have
47:33 - X number of years that you have savings
47:35 - spending that time making multiple games
47:37 - gives you more chances at finding
47:38 - success as opposed to just one so that's
47:40 - really awesome and refund rates are not
47:43 - high on Tiny games so if you make
47:44 - something that is only like 4 hours long
47:47 - as long as it's good the refr rate is
47:49 - really going to be the same that's
47:50 - usually one criticism that people have
47:52 - of tiny games which is oh they're going
47:54 - to play it for like two hours four hours
47:56 - they're going to play like half the game
47:57 - refund and so on but turns out most
47:59 - people don't really do that so you can
48:00 - even make a 2-hour game as long as it's
48:03 - good then yeah like for example a short
48:05 - hike yeah this is a great example I
48:07 - think this game is like less than two
48:08 - hours long but there you go overwhelming
48:10 - positive view oh wow that is literally
48:12 - 99% positive wow that's insane that is
48:15 - cool uh so yeah definitely and uh yeah
48:19 - people playing for 6 hours 7 hours 4
48:21 - hours 1 hour 8 hours 3 hours so yeah
48:25 - basically the idea that small games get
48:27 - higher refund rates thankfully that is
48:29 - not really thing so you can definitely
48:31 - make small games and won't uh be a
48:34 - negative impact and yep you won't make
48:36 - your dream game but believe you'll make
48:38 - something better yeah for me this is an
48:40 - interesting one because I don't
48:41 - necessarily have any kind of dream game
48:43 - I've got a ton of different ideas that I
48:45 - very much would like to build but no
48:47 - dream game specifically I actually made
48:49 - a video on that topic yeah I'm making my
48:51 - not dream game on how I don't really
48:53 - have dream game I just have a ton of
48:55 - different ideas that I very much would
48:56 - like to wouldn't like to build so as I
49:00 - as I imagin myself like 70 years from
49:02 - now when I'm 100 I want to look back and
49:04 - be able to see okay I made like 50 games
49:06 - that are all really interesting really
49:08 - different as opposed to oh I just made
49:10 - five masterpieces I guess I don't like
49:13 - the idea of making a ton of stuff as
49:14 - opposed to just a small amount of
49:17 - things this game but tiny such an easy
49:19 - pitch yep that's also like a while ago
49:21 - we were talking about how to come up
49:22 - with ideas and the one% didn't like a
49:25 - short hike that's a good question uh so
49:28 - yeah it's an easy pitch to say it's just
49:30 - like this game but much smaller much
49:32 - more focused so yeah coming up with
49:34 - ideas for small for simple games for
49:36 - small games that can also make it much
49:39 - easier to come up with interesting ideas
49:41 - making small games makes your indie game
49:43 - death life and mental health so much
49:44 - better yep I would say being able to
49:47 - basically finish games much more quickly
49:50 - so it's relatively easy to stay
49:52 - motivated on a single project for like 3
49:53 - months it's much much harder to stay
49:56 - motivated on just that one project for
49:57 - like 5 years so when it comes to that
49:59 - when it comes to being able to deal with
50:02 - yourself oh yeah gmtk finish mind over
50:04 - magn yeah I I saw that video I haven't
50:06 - or I saw the video on my recommend but I
50:08 - haven't actually seen it but is it
50:11 - actually finished or
50:15 - or or okay so oh November yeah so I'm
50:18 - guessing he's doing a bunch of Polish
50:20 - and yeah this is also one that took him
50:23 - quite a lot when did he uh
50:27 - when did he
50:29 - start this
50:31 - one uh my magnet on SE I think the first
50:35 - one was called your first C game did he
50:38 - do it okay so this was kind of like his
50:41 - prototype when he made the or nope yep
50:44 - that's developing two what's developing
50:48 - one
50:50 - uh did you make it or was it that one
50:54 - okay maybe it was that one anyways it
50:55 - was around
50:57 - around here that was two years ago so
50:59 - yeah he spent over two years so two to
51:01 - three years making a a really
51:05 - interesting puzzle platformer at least
51:07 - he like me personally I'm not it was
51:10 - after the flight Bird video so yeah that
51:12 - was
51:17 - um where is it I'm not seeing flight
51:19 - burn but yeah anyways around this like 2
51:21 - 3 years so yeah I mean in his case he
51:25 - started essentially from zero as far as
51:26 - I know he didn't have any previous uh
51:29 - Game Dev experience so yeah spending two
51:32 - to three years building a complex like
51:34 - this cuz it does look complex even
51:36 - though it's a platform it does have a
51:38 - bunch of interesting mechanics and it
51:39 - made a lot of interesting stuff in terms
51:41 - of well building the entire art himself
51:43 - so that takes quite a while so yeah
51:46 - definitely uh an
51:48 - interesting steamdb doino to see so if
51:52 - we see mine over
51:54 - magnet and let's see how much is it it's
51:58 - on 2,000 so around 20,000 maybe 30,000
52:01 - wish list so yeah although this one
52:05 - again for all of you watching keep in
52:06 - mind this does not mean puzzle platforms
52:09 - are easy to find success chances are
52:11 - this one will find success because a he
52:13 - has a huge audience and B he's actually
52:15 - been doing a ton of play testing so I'm
52:16 - sure the final game will actually be
52:18 - good because he's been having a ton of
52:19 - people play it and improving on the
52:21 - feedback and doing all those things so
52:23 - he has been iterating a lot so I'm
52:24 - pretty sure the final game will be good
52:26 - in terms of gameplay but if you yourself
52:29 - are making a puzzle platformer I would
52:31 - definitely carefully caution you against
52:33 - that just because puzzle platforms are
52:35 - really difficult so essentially this one
52:37 - is essentially going to be uh the
52:39 - exception that proves the role so making
52:41 - a successful puzzle platform is really
52:42 - difficult this one is likely going to be
52:44 - successful but don't use that as an
52:46 - example of saying okay this one is going
52:48 - to sell uh 10,000 copies so mine can
52:51 - also sell 10,000 copies now that is
52:53 - actually uh quite difficult but uh yeah
52:56 - with uh 20 to 30,000 wish list hopefully
53:00 - the game willon be good hopefully it
53:01 - won't be successful so yeah that will be
53:04 - I'm definitely curious to play it just
53:06 - see it should be uh quite nice
53:11 - soon videos on dos course getting out
53:13 - soon keep up the good work yeah thanks
53:15 - I'm glad you like the videos uh yep I've
53:17 - been researching like for the next uh
53:20 - update I'm going to be covering the
53:22 - animation system and I think I'll also
53:23 - cover a bunch of buildings so I've been
53:26 - looking at my my prototype that I built
53:29 - in order to see all the elements that I
53:31 - made I'm refactoring a bunch of that
53:32 - code in order to make the final uh
53:34 - course code so yeah I'm currently in the
53:36 - process of doing that but yeah in terms
53:39 - of when I'm not too sure I was planning
53:42 - for like the second week of this month
53:43 - but but it's already like the end of
53:45 - this so I'm not sure it's going to be
53:47 - that so maybe around this week maybe
53:48 - something like that so I'm actively
53:51 - working on it so definitely at some
53:53 - point around here it should be fun and
53:55 - see animation
53:57 - uh part so yeah animation is fun to work
54:00 - with so even though it's going to be
54:02 - relatively complex to get animation done
54:04 - uh it should be a fun one so yeah
54:05 - definitely stay tuned for that
54:07 - yeah plan to upload games to the Play
54:10 - Store for mobile if not then why uh well
54:13 - the why is because making mobile games
54:15 - is different from making PC games you've
54:17 - got a different input system like you've
54:19 - got touch instead of mouse and keyboard
54:21 - so that makes it different you've got
54:23 - different screen resolution so basically
54:24 - you can't really just take a
54:26 - uh PC console game and just Port it to
54:28 - mobile and just assume that everything
54:30 - is going to work properly now it does
54:32 - require quite a bit more iteration on
54:34 - that so that's one reason then another
54:36 - reason is mobile is even more difficult
54:37 - than steam like the in terms of uh how
54:41 - crowd it is like on Steam uh you can see
54:44 - Steam developers complain about steam
54:46 - all the time because steam has like 20
54:48 - 20 new games coming out every single day
54:50 - on mobile that is like 200 games so yeah
54:53 - steam is already crowded and mobile is
54:55 - insanely crowded so on mobile
54:57 - essentially if you don't have like an
54:58 - advertising budget it is really
55:00 - difficult to make it so yeah those are
55:03 - usually my two things I don't know too
55:05 - much how to how to do marketing on
55:07 - mobile how to find success with mobile
55:09 - game and in terms of input it requires
55:11 - quite a lot of reworking quite a lot of
55:12 - refactoring so yeah because those things
55:14 - I really just stick stick in my Lane so
55:17 - stick making PC games hopefully console
55:19 - games stick with that uh doing something
55:22 - like that
55:25 - yeah that's about Y6 I've only been
55:27 - using it a little bit but so far seems
55:29 - fine haven't had any crashes everything
55:31 - works pretty fine so yeah it's all
55:33 - really nice although I haven't uh use
55:35 - any of the new graphics features I
55:37 - haven't touched those yet so yeah
55:40 - definitely do want to give those a try
55:41 - but so far it's been Prett pretty nice
55:43 - so yeah M you can talk with Publishers
55:46 - yeah I guess if you have a publisher
55:47 - that does know the market and they can
55:49 - help you actually bring that that game
55:51 - to Market that caned help although of
55:53 - course with a publisher you've got
55:56 - you've got to give an amount to that
55:58 - polisher whether that is a good or bad
55:59 - deal that really depends so as with so
56:02 - many things when it comes to polishers
56:03 - there are good ones bad ones there are
56:04 - ones that can probably be really good
56:06 - and ones that can probably be not very
56:08 - good so yeah finding which one of those
56:11 - again you got to know that world and me
56:12 - personally I really do not know that
56:14 - world so
56:16 - yeah have any materials on inverse
56:19 - kinematics yep I do have the one on
56:21 - animation briging which is
56:23 - the the uh
56:26 - rigging the uh there you go which is
56:31 - Unity to for making
56:33 - um
56:35 - uh ah crap I hate the I'm used to having
56:38 - premium I'm used to not seeing any ads
56:42 - uh yeah so animation riging this is
56:43 - unity's uh package for doing inverse
56:46 - kinematics so you can do a bunch of
56:47 - constraints put a bunch of targets and
56:49 - yeah you can do a bunch of fun stuff and
56:51 - at the end you can make the simple thing
56:53 - so just making a weapon follow any kind
56:55 - of thing so so yep if you want to make
56:57 - some uh animation riging definitely uh
57:00 - go ahead and do that yeah y do has
57:03 - something you would not recommend for
57:04 - beginners and uh yep that is correct I
57:07 - do not recommend for beginners I think
57:09 - dots and ECS is really awesome really
57:11 - cool
57:13 - but but yeah it's definitely an an
57:16 - advanced tool set
57:19 - so uh yeah like here on the on the
57:22 - course page like I said this is not a B
57:23 - level course so dots is an insanely
57:25 - powerful tool I definitely recommend you
57:27 - learn but only once you're in the
57:29 - intermediate or Advanced stage if you're
57:30 - a beginner then do not worry about dots
57:32 - at all just focus on learning the basics
57:34 - with game objects and normal C an
57:36 - example you can follow my beginner
57:37 - kitchen CH course or my C beginner to
57:39 - advance course to learn those Basics to
57:41 - get the intermediate level and then once
57:42 - you get to the intermediate level or if
57:44 - you're there already then yep I highly
57:46 - recommend you learn about dots so
57:47 - essentially when it comes to dots for
57:49 - beginners nope don't worry about it just
57:51 - stick with game objects you can make
57:53 - pretty much any game with game objects
57:55 - so you can do all that and then once you
57:57 - feel comfortable and once you would like
57:58 - to explore a tool that has a lot of
58:00 - really awesome positives at that point
58:02 - then yeah you can start learning about
58:04 - dots and basically get a new tool in
58:06 - your tool bound but for beginners sck
58:09 - with game objects don't worry about dots
58:11 - yeah your water intake a day 4 liters a
58:15 - [Music]
58:16 - day uh it's been a while since I counted
58:19 - but yeah it's roughly around 4 lers that
58:21 - I drink per day yeah pretty much that's
58:23 - about it basally I got a mug and that
58:25 - mug fills up with about 300 and this
58:28 - thing is about 750 I think so yeah that
58:32 - plus all the water that I drink at the
58:33 - gym plus all the water that I drink at
58:35 - the middle of the day yeah roughly
58:37 - around 4 lit a day which is a pretty
58:40 - nice amount it's pretty cool it's nice
58:41 - to be it's nice to be hydrated I
58:44 - guess
58:46 - uh bench max it's uh 120 kilos which is
58:51 - pretty heavy it took me quite a while to
58:53 - get to this point so yeah it's quite
58:55 - crazy at the same time to see people
58:56 - like Larry Willams just easily warming
58:59 - up easily warming up with my max bench
59:02 - but yeah it's a it's a fun journey I
59:04 - remember back in the beginning when I
59:05 - started I was doing it with like five
59:07 - kilos on each side of the bar so 510 uh
59:10 - I was benching just 30 kilos and it was
59:12 - pretty heavy and yeah now being able to
59:15 - do 120 that is definitely feels like a
59:17 - nice fun achievement so that could be uh
59:20 - that was nice think about the future of
59:22 - VR is an industry that won't grow should
59:24 - I start in VR or X
59:27 - that is a very good question I think yes
59:29 - I think it it's an industry that will
59:31 - grow but like if you go back like 5
59:34 - years ago people were expecting VR was
59:36 - going to essentially just flight the the
59:37 - moon when in reality it's been a very
59:39 - slow and steady uptrend so yes it is
59:42 - still growing as far as I know but it's
59:44 - a very slow growth so in the future it
59:47 - won be bigger but it won't necessarily
59:48 - be like 10 times bigger so it w keep
59:51 - growing there is an interest in that
59:53 - personally I'm a big fan of VR and I
59:54 - think both VR and X are I think those
59:56 - are really good although at the same
59:59 - time with apple coming into the um the
60:02 - thing with the Apple Vision Pro which
60:04 - actually made a a can't open it uh with
60:08 - the Apple Vision Pro people thought okay
60:10 - this is going to save a ton of things
60:13 - was see I did one of these uh talked
60:17 - about the Apple Vision Pro don't
60:18 - remember which one but yeah essentially
60:20 - with the Apple Vision prop we're
60:21 - expecting okay this is going to really
60:22 - blow up but in reality nope it did not
60:25 - blow up it just sold a little bit so
60:27 - moved up a little bit but at the same
60:29 - time uh meta is currently working on the
60:32 - meta Quest Pro or uh sorry The Meta
60:34 - Quest 4 and also a new iteration to The
60:36 - Meta Quest Pro so lots of interesting
60:38 - things and yeah definitely is an
60:40 - industry that I do think yeah VR is also
60:43 - used a lot in maintenance for big
60:44 - manufacturer yeah I do think in terms of
60:47 - Industry VR is going to grow more than
60:49 - it does in entertainment I think that is
60:51 - probably going to be the thing in terms
60:52 - of Industry maintenance working with big
60:56 - machines or education sort of things
60:58 - like educating doctors and stuff like
61:00 - that I do think the industry is going to
61:02 - grow quite a bit more in those areas and
61:05 - when it comes to entertainment it's
61:06 - going to be a much slower smaller run
61:09 - so yeah that is roughly my view I do
61:13 - like VR I do think it's great I do think
61:15 - it will continue to grow but we not have
61:17 - an insane uh grow just like
61:21 - that uh incline bench I really don't
61:24 - like incline so I've never really tried
61:27 - out uh my Max on incline so my Max is
61:30 - like I don't know like uh 2030 60 80 so
61:35 - like 80 is like the most that I normally
61:36 - do cuz I really don't like incline just
61:38 - I don't know it's a it's a it's a
61:40 - strange one I don't feel too confident
61:42 - so yeah normal justu uh normal bench
61:46 - yeah hey artam hey how's it going
61:50 - yeah want to learn how to combine
61:52 - different program languages on the same
61:53 - project can you give me an idea of a
61:55 - small project combine C++ C and python I
61:58 - mean for that goal you don't necessarily
62:01 - need any specific project literally any
62:04 - project can be and you can be like you
62:06 - make one mechanic with C normal in
62:09 - unity then you make another mechanic in
62:12 - Python although how do you can you
62:15 - export python into a dlll something like
62:17 - that or can you I guess you can run
62:20 - python directly inside Unity so I guess
62:22 - actually that could be easy then on C++
62:24 - you could make some kind of
62:26 - uh some kind of liary and important C so
62:29 - yeah I guess you could do that just come
62:30 - up with some idea and just split it into
62:33 - multiple different uh mechanics so yeah
62:35 - flppy bird that could be a good one so
62:37 - maybe make the bird jumping up and down
62:39 - maybe write that code in C for the pipes
62:42 - maybe write those in C++ and then for
62:44 - the UI for calculating the score maybe
62:46 - write that in Python so yeah that could
62:48 - could definitely be a uh fun one yeah
62:52 - should be
62:54 - nice okay let me just
62:56 - uh keep going here yeah this was fun
62:59 - yeah so on the one about start small and
63:01 - say small yeah m is a big fan of making
63:03 - small games as opposed to spending 5
63:05 - years working on your Masterpiece I
63:06 - believe you'll learn a lot more by
63:08 - making multiple three to six months
63:09 - games than spending years on a single
63:11 - one especially if you are a beginner my
63:13 - advice is don't spend more than six
63:14 - months on your first three to five games
63:16 - make more games make them faster and you
63:18 - will learn a ton very quickly so this
63:19 - actually something that I didn't mention
63:21 - up here which is also the rate of your
63:23 - learning I really do believe you'll
63:24 - learn a lot more by finishing multiple
63:26 - projects as opposed to just making one
63:27 - massive project something that I've said
63:30 - many times is how unintentionally one of
63:32 - the awesome things that I did in my
63:34 - Learning Journey was just spending my
63:35 - five years that I spent making Flash
63:37 - games like in those five years I made 40
63:40 - flash games so that's 40 40 and yeah I
63:43 - really do think that helped my learning
63:45 - process quite a lot making so many games
63:47 - and making so many games that were very
63:48 - different so it wasn't like 40 games
63:50 - those were wrong like top down Shooters
63:52 - no I made shooter games I made
63:54 - simulation games management games I made
63:56 - racing games I made all kinds of games
63:58 - and I really do believe that building
63:59 - all those games all that gave me a ton
64:01 - of experience which gave me a ton of
64:03 - knowledge so that is another reason why
64:05 - I'm a big fan of this strategy start
64:06 - small and stay small is because by
64:09 - making multiple games you'll learn a lot
64:10 - more than making just one giant game so
64:13 - yeah definitely a big fan of
64:16 - [Music]
64:18 - that host are participa in the game Jam
64:21 - Thor just had his uh there are more than
64:23 - a few coming up this month yep yep I
64:26 - definitely would like to host a game gam
64:28 - that is something that has been on my
64:30 - ideas list for many many years but yeah
64:32 - being able to organize game gem is a ton
64:35 - of work so technically yes I would love
64:38 - to but I'm only so busy with so many
64:40 - things so coming up with organizing a
64:43 - massive thing if I want to do I want to
64:44 - do it properly so I would want to
64:46 - properly organize not just say okay
64:48 - here's the game Jam go out do your thing
64:50 - no I would want it to be something quite
64:52 - a bit more properly so yeah eventually
64:55 - yes
64:56 - but don't know when so I guess uh we
64:59 - shall
65:00 - see to make your dot scor free if yes
65:02 - then when I'm planning to make the first
65:05 - few hours of the course free so like if
65:07 - the entire course in the end ends up
65:09 - being I don't know like 30 hours long I
65:11 - do plan to make like the first 10 hours
65:13 - free on YouTube so that is essentially
65:15 - the goal so that is partly why uh on the
65:18 - course itself I focused on on the first
65:20 - few lectures focusing specifically more
65:23 - on the on the court things of dots and
65:26 - the 11 lectures on more spec specific
65:29 - things more specific to this game so
65:31 - that way when I make the free version on
65:33 - YouTube you'll be able to learn a lot
65:35 - about the general things of how dots
65:36 - works so if you want to learn just for
65:38 - free just that one will be more than
65:40 - enough and then if you want to learn
65:41 - about this specific game all those
65:43 - specific uh features you can then pick
65:46 - up the entire thing but yeah you can see
65:48 - here right in the beginning starts with
65:50 - all the setup and so on then learning
65:51 - about not subc baking how that works how
65:54 - to create a component how to set up the
65:55 - the unit how to do a basic system how to
65:57 - work with physics how to get the mosor
65:59 - position how to click to move so click
66:01 - to move somewhere how to convert into
66:03 - job and so on dots physics recast and
66:05 - yeah so basically I made sure in the
66:07 - beginning to include as many different
66:09 - dots things as possible so that even
66:11 - people who just uh follow the free
66:13 - version they can still learn the dot
66:15 - stuff and learn how to use this really
66:17 - awesome tool in their own games because
66:20 - yeah it is a really awesome tool really
66:23 - nice a video covering how to proper
66:25 - destroy objects with
66:28 - dots I'm I mean uh no I don't have any
66:31 - specific video on that although I'm not
66:33 - sure what you mean by properly destroy
66:35 - in theory you just destroy the entity
66:38 - and everything gets destroyed it only
66:40 - becomes slightly complex if you have
66:43 - like parent child relationships but even
66:45 - at that point if you destroy the parent
66:47 - everything should be destroyed so nope
66:50 - don't really have anything specific just
66:52 - because that usually should should be
66:54 - relatively simple depending on what
66:56 - you're doing so yeah that you've got
66:58 - your bearings and thoughts that affect
67:00 - your thoughts on its ideal use case
67:02 - anything harder easier than expected
67:05 - uh well in terms
67:08 - of in terms of my thoughts didn't really
67:10 - change too much I thought dots was
67:12 - awesome whenever you need Extreme
67:13 - Performance and I still think it is
67:15 - awesome whenever you need Extreme
67:16 - Performance so I guess the one thing
67:19 - that changed in my mind was like when
67:20 - they first announced it like five years
67:21 - ago it looked like the best thing was
67:23 - going to be okay just make games either
67:26 - full dots or full game objects whereas
67:27 - now it is very clear no the goal is a
67:30 - hybrid workflow so for some things like
67:32 - for example DUI really don't make UI and
67:34 - dots that really doesn't make much sense
67:36 - so keep building your normal uis just
67:38 - using Game objects but then for things
67:40 - like you've got an RTS you want to
67:42 - control tons of units those units should
67:44 - probably be dots entities if so they
67:46 - benefit quite a bit and once you learn
67:48 - how dots works it is actually not
67:50 - necessarily harder or easier than game
67:52 - objects really just a different way of
67:54 - doing things so so yeah when it comes to
67:56 - ideal use case anytime you need Extreme
67:59 - Performance I think it's a great thing
68:01 - or if you just uh if you just personally
68:03 - really enjoy working on a data oriented
68:04 - design if so then yeah dots is also a
68:07 - really awesome thing so yeah it's really
68:09 - just another tool in your tool belt and
68:11 - I do think it is an excellent tool for a
68:12 - lot of use cases specifically when it
68:14 - comes to Performance so yeah it should
68:16 - be
68:18 - fun if you make a thown shooter yep you
68:21 - just call uh en manager. destroy the
68:24 - entity and there you go it just gets
68:26 - destroyed so yeah usually should be uh
68:29 - pretty much just like
68:31 - that would you make like procedural mesh
68:34 - generation with probuilder like multiple
68:36 - rooms with like one
68:38 - mesh I'm not sure with probuilder well I
68:40 - guess I mean technically with prob
68:42 - Builder you can call the functions so
68:43 - technically I guess you
68:45 - could although that seems like
68:47 - a I don't know probuilder is usually
68:50 - made for actually building the things uh
68:54 - inside the editor and not that
68:55 - necessarily for building things
68:56 - dynamically although again technically
68:58 - you can cuz you can call all the
68:59 - functions but yeah personally I wouldn't
69:01 - really do that if you want to do
69:04 - procedural mesh generation I would
69:06 - really just work with the mesh itself
69:07 - just work with the vertex array and
69:09 - modify those I would use those instead
69:12 - of trying to make it work with
69:13 - probuilder so I don't think that would
69:15 - make things easier I think that would
69:17 - make it more complex but if you want
69:19 - multiple rooms in like one
69:23 - mesh normally when it comes to Pras
69:25 - generation the easier way to do it is
69:26 - make a bunch of prefabs for all your
69:28 - rooms and then instead of dynamically
69:29 - generating those rooms instead of that
69:31 - really just pick a random room then
69:33 - connect another random room then another
69:34 - random room and so on so you're not
69:37 - randomly generating like entire meshes
69:39 - you're just manually generating a bunch
69:42 - of pieces for the prefabs and then just
69:43 - connecting random pieces together and
69:46 - that uh Works quite well so yeah that's
69:48 - usually how I prefer to do that oh it's
69:52 - right the anti antic command buffer yeah
69:54 - if you're uh cycling through entities
69:56 - that is not
69:58 - the if you're trying to destroy an
70:00 - entity that is included within the query
70:01 - you're going to have an error so yeah
70:03 - definitely do use a an anti command
70:05 - buffer in order to do it afterwards yeah
70:07 - recently got hot reload have you tried
70:09 - it nope I'm pretty sure I did buy it I
70:12 - think but nope I haven't tried it yet
70:14 - it's one of the many assets on my list
70:16 - that I very much would like to try
70:17 - because I've heard great things about
70:18 - that one I think that one is even like
70:20 - an official uh like Unity uh what do you
70:23 - call like supported Unity something uh
70:27 - acid unity.com
70:33 - I'm pretty sure it's actually yeah there
70:35 - you go with the popular asset yeah
70:36 - verified Solution that's what I want so
70:38 - yep I've heard great things about it I
70:40 - haven't used it but I have heard great
70:41 - things about it so yeah look at that
70:44 - nominated for the awards fun wow that is
70:47 - that's a big difference nice uh yeah
70:51 - very good so yep I haven't used it but
70:53 - it does look really awesome so
70:56 - yeah try UI tilit or stick to yugui in
71:00 - unity I'm planning to adapt it not sure
71:02 - I have tried it and for example for my C
71:05 - course the the companion project that I
71:08 - built is this I don't even know
71:11 - see. my C course for this one I did make
71:15 - the entire companion project so all this
71:18 - all these custom windows that I made for
71:20 - the uh making the quizzes the exercise
71:23 - the things all this I made in UI tokit
71:25 - and was actually really nice I really
71:26 - enjoyed working with it it was
71:27 - definitely a nice experience definitely
71:30 - much better than using IM GUI for
71:32 - building editor windows so yeah that was
71:33 - definitely much better but when it comes
71:35 - to real time in-game UI for that I'm
71:38 - really just going to stick with un UI
71:41 - this is a big upgrade when compared to I
71:43 - am GUI but I think un Y is really
71:46 - awesome I really like it so I really
71:47 - don't see a reason of changing from that
71:49 - one so yeah for edited tools I will
71:51 - definitely use u toen in the future but
71:54 - for uh normal uh in-game UI I will keep
71:57 - using uni just like that
72:03 - yeah programmer's guide to Art no I
72:05 - haven't seen it that sounds like an
72:08 - interesting topic yeah definitely want
72:10 - to our
72:15 - art nice I haven't seen it yeah I'll add
72:19 - this to my Q thanks for the
72:22 - tip they for me my best uh
72:26 - my best trick when it comes to Art is
72:27 - just buying assets so yeah if I was able
72:30 - to produce something a bit better that
72:31 - would be uh nice um of course I learned
72:34 - that there are some very useful uh
72:37 - packages like s machine Sprite CD input
72:39 - system Etc what basic packages do you
72:41 - recommend to include I mean those are
72:42 - basically the ones that you mentioned so
72:44 - yeah the sprice package I wonder why
72:46 - that one is not installed by default
72:47 - makes me wonder is there any game that
72:49 - does not use the Sprites package that
72:51 - seems very strange cuz even 3D games
72:53 - they have UI elements so I don't know
72:56 - why that one is is is not built into the
72:58 - engine but anyways yeah that's one that
73:00 - I install all the time C Machine yep
73:02 - always and input system yeah whenever
73:04 - it's a more complex project I also use
73:06 - that so yeah other packages I don't know
73:10 - I don't think anything else specifically
73:13 - those are all really awesome ones so
73:16 - yeah beyond that
73:20 - uh TD TD Sprite Yep this one I really
73:24 - don't know what it seems like you always
73:26 - need the Sprite editor window for
73:28 - something but anyways so out of those
73:31 - yeah when it comes to the essentials
73:34 - that's pretty much it first why is this
73:36 - installed by default oh it's used by the
73:37 - universal RP oh I didn't know that
73:39 - that's nice that's fun see C Machine
73:42 - really awesome
73:44 - and yeah when it comes to the general
73:47 - ones that are used for all things and
73:51 - yeah those are basically it
73:55 - I mean I guess if you want to use super
73:57 - fast code maybe in the mathematical
73:58 - Library so you can do things with the
74:00 - job system but that feels like it's a
74:02 - bit more uh of an intense use case uh
74:06 - maybe spines maybe that could be
74:07 - interesting I haven't used it too much
74:09 - but the little that I've used did seem
74:10 - like an interesting one and yeah so for
74:15 - those uh those are indeed the general
74:18 - ones that I would always uh
74:22 - install in6 prevent Found Real Time
74:24 - lighting urp broken when you use it from
74:27 - Custom Sky
74:28 - Box okay I'm not sure because I have not
74:31 - used a custom Sky Box so really is it
74:34 - broken like over here I've got this is
74:36 - Unity 6 but yeah it doesn't have any Uh
74:40 - custom Sky Box so yeah it's not going
74:42 - to have any
74:45 - issues uh but yeah anyways uh so nope I
74:48 - haven't experience that so I'm not uh
74:52 - sure
74:56 - I make people hear about my game on
74:58 - Steam uh the answer is well the answer
75:01 - is marketing so Twitter Reddit Tik Tok
75:05 - YouTube uh literally anywhere you can
75:08 - find anywhere you can tell people about
75:09 - your game that is the answer there is no
75:11 - single bullet there is no one single
75:13 - thing uh it's really just yeah talk
75:16 - about your game as much as possible make
75:18 - some compelling shorts on YouTube some
75:20 - compelling Tik toks and hope that one of
75:22 - them goes viral and gets you a bunch of
75:25 - wish lists and then hope that those wish
75:27 - lists convert which then helps you find
75:28 - success so yeah it's very much a it's
75:31 - very much a case to do a ton of stuff
75:33 - hopefully some of it sticks and then
75:35 - hopefully some of that uh gets you quite
75:37 - a bit of uh
75:40 - success well Unity 6 at this point we're
75:42 - still testing it out right now would say
75:44 - fully in like if I were to start a new
75:46 - project right now I would definitely be
75:47 - using Unity 6 I mean it's probably going
75:49 - to reach LTS version within the next few
75:52 - months so yep and it seems pretty stable
75:54 - I haven't had any issues I've been using
75:56 - it in a bunch of projects and no issues
75:58 - it's fast works fine so yep definitely
76:01 - seems like a uh pretty good
76:04 - one okay so let me just uh yeah so
76:07 - another news so subscribe to your mouse
76:09 - so this was a very strange one so
76:11 - Logitech the company that makes tons of
76:13 - peripherals is apparently thinking about
76:14 - selling a mouse with a subscription
76:16 - service the forever Mouse this was very
76:19 - strange news the idea being that a mouse
76:21 - requires software updates so doesn't
76:24 - yeah I don't know know uh but the
76:26 - hardware does not need to change so in
76:27 - order to support constant development of
76:29 - those software updates they cannot sell
76:30 - something just once so is this premise
76:33 - correct does the mouse require updates
76:35 - since they work by default even without
76:36 - their special software it tells me those
76:38 - updates aren't really required I'll
76:40 - replace my mouse when it stops working I
76:41 - think I've had four different ones in 30
76:43 - years so in my case I really I do know
76:46 - that uh Logitech they do have their
76:49 - special software
76:52 - thingy uh but but this doesn't feel like
76:56 - it is necessary like it's only necessary
76:58 - for like setting up lights changing DPI
77:01 - and so on so basically with this I
77:02 - installed this just because I have to
77:04 - then set it up to 800 DPI and that's
77:07 - really about it so yeah technically
77:09 - there is software but it doesn't feel
77:11 - like it's a requirement so when I read
77:13 - this news that was my main thing so does
77:15 - a mouse really require software updates
77:18 - it does feel very strange anyways but
77:22 - yeah one interesting tidbit of
77:23 - information that inter for you was when
77:25 - says how only about 50% of people use a
77:27 - mouse and a keyboard today which I guess
77:29 - makes sense given how prevalent touch
77:30 - devices are nowadays but me as someone
77:32 - who use desktop 95% of the time I find
77:34 - that that fascinating so yeah for me I
77:36 - definitely use mouse and keyboard uh all
77:39 - the time so whenever I'm here on my
77:41 - desktop or when I'm on my laptop so yeah
77:43 - for me I do find it fascinating I mean I
77:46 - would assume that it is relatively High
77:48 - the people that don't use it just
77:49 - because uh mobile phones and lap and uh
77:53 - tablets those I've gotten so so much
77:55 - better but still 50% that seems quite
77:57 - crazy like I can't imagine doing any
77:59 - serious work on a touch device at least
78:02 - to me that but I guess not everyone is a
78:05 - programmer so not everyone needs
78:07 - specific typing of things so I guess for
78:09 - more simple just talking about things I
78:12 - guess just such devices work well so but
78:15 - yeah that was definitely
78:17 - a an interesting set on how it's 50%
78:20 - that seems actually uh quite high so
78:22 - when it comes to software we are never
78:23 - going back so Photoshop is a
78:25 - subscription Unity is a subscription
78:27 - office as well but for Hardware
78:28 - especially a mouse I can't imagine
78:30 - people want that so yeah and I think
78:32 - since uh since I wrote this I mean this
78:34 - news came out like last week and since
78:37 - then I think they have posted out a
78:39 - statement saying No this was just an
78:40 - idea we're not actually going to pursue
78:42 - it so thankfully it seems that people
78:44 - weren't really interested in in uh
78:46 - subscribing to their Mouse so yeah
78:49 - thankfully it seems like this one is not
78:50 - going to really
78:52 - happen we don't want software RS either
78:55 - yeah but sadly for that one I think that
78:57 - one uh that one has been settled there
79:00 - are more than enough people paying for
79:03 - it either happily or unhappily so yeah I
79:05 - really don't think that when it comes to
79:06 - software those are going back even if
79:08 - people dislike it like I wish I could
79:09 - just buy Photoshop ones and that's it
79:11 - but nope I don't think that one is going
79:13 - back but yeah thankfully at least when
79:15 - it comes to Hardware hopefully this will
79:17 - really take hold so yeah I use my g915
79:21 - keyboard G 920s webcam and a Pro
79:24 - Wireless
79:25 - which is kind of funny I it's like it it
79:27 - wasn't necessarily intentional but I did
79:28 - end up with tons of Logitech stuff just
79:31 - just by accident and I really like it so
79:33 - yeah I mean uh these are really good but
79:35 - I definitely would not like having to
79:37 - pay a subscription for it that would
79:38 - definitely be a strange one uh although
79:41 - no matter how much I like it how much I
79:42 - like my setup I can't imagine paying a
79:44 - monthly subscription so this idea sounds
79:46 - very strange to me I also have no
79:48 - interest in an AI powered Mouse with
79:49 - tons of extra lights profiles features
79:51 - that they have nowadays I just set the
79:53 - DPI to 800 to 1,000 HZ Z the RGB and
79:56 - that's really it so yeah when it comes
79:58 - to me really no need
80:01 - for complex software for my mouse as
80:04 - long as it works as a mouse uh it's
80:06 - working perfectly fine for me so yeah
80:08 - this is a definitely quite a strange one
80:14 - yeah [ __ ] is good enough never going to
80:16 - pay yourself for Photoshop nice yeah
80:18 - yeah if uh you find something with a
80:21 - better service model better business
80:22 - model that works then yeah definitely do
80:24 - go for it and yeah it's uh it's
80:28 - definitely awesome to not have to pay 60
80:30 - bucks a month but yeah for me I got used
80:33 - to photoshop I got used to Premiere so
80:36 - they kind of got me yeah sadly that's uh
80:39 - how it goes what might the use yeah it's
80:41 - the blue yeti which I've had well I've
80:44 - had for literally since the very
80:46 - beginning of this channel so yeah I've
80:49 - had it
80:50 - for uh well I guess since 2013 so I've
80:53 - had it for a very long time and some
80:55 - works it's a nice microphone seems to
80:57 - work pretty well so yeah pretty uh
81:00 - pretty nice one
81:02 - yeah Le the Advan seop course uh they go
81:05 - somewhere in the middle of this month
81:07 - so probably on a Monday so probably yeah
81:10 - probably on here probably on the 19th
81:12 - something like that so yeah that's
81:14 - that's a plan so it should be uh around
81:16 - that use the pendy injection I recently
81:19 - started using zenj dependency injection
81:22 - uh not quite just because when when it
81:24 - comes to Super hardcore testing usually
81:27 - I don't do too much usually I I try to
81:30 - make my my code testable without
81:33 - actually writing tests so since I don't
81:35 - actually write tests I don't necessarily
81:37 - need too much for dependency injection
81:39 - but I definitely do use a ton of
81:40 - interpace in my code so technically if I
81:42 - wanted to do it technically I could do
81:44 - it so yeah I don't really use it but I
81:47 - could use it and uh and yeah zenject if
81:51 - you're doing something uh pretty complex
81:53 - then that using a proper API to do
81:55 - dependency injection that can definitely
81:57 - be a positive thing so yeah that is a a
82:00 - great tool to learn how to use yeah have
82:03 - a few friends that have expressed
82:04 - interest in Game Dev but are starting
82:05 - totally from scratch do you have video
82:07 - series you'd recommend for absolute
82:09 - beginners uh I would say oh man I've got
82:12 - way too many tabs oh if you want to
82:15 - learn about C then my uh free C video or
82:19 - my C course that would be great but if
82:21 - you want specifically about Game Dev
82:25 - uh or beginner I've got my kitchen chaos
82:28 - 10hour course which a lot of people seem
82:30 - to run love so I'll definitely use this
82:33 - love you hey love you too yeah thanks
82:34 - for being here uh so yeah this one a lot
82:37 - of people really enjoyed this video it's
82:39 - probably my most successful video on
82:41 - this channel so yeah uh for beginners
82:44 - this one's really awesome starts from
82:45 - the absolute beginning until making a
82:47 - nice fun game uh so yeah definitely
82:50 - start with those either that one for C
82:52 - specifically or that one for learning
82:54 - how to make a game from start finish
82:56 - yeah guys great nice yeah I'm glad I'm
82:59 - glad people like it hey Ward hey Brazil
83:02 - so what time is it in Brazil I guess
83:04 - minus eight hours 6 hours something like
83:06 - that so I guess like midday yeah yeah
83:09 - what
83:12 - uh said 120 m is having a 10mth free you
83:15 - pay annually but I think uh price for
83:17 - miles is Pro game price uh yes with
83:21 - difference being that I guess after uh
83:23 - one year you still have the mouse
83:25 - whereas with the subscription you paid
83:27 - for one year and after one year if you
83:29 - stop paying you'll lose it so yeah for
83:31 - me I'm a big fan of buying things and
83:33 - then keep using them until they stop
83:35 - working so for this Mouse yeah I'm
83:37 - guessing this mouse is like 100 bucks
83:38 - something like that but I've had it for
83:42 - over a year I think so yeah I guess I've
83:43 - already paid less than 10 bucks a month
83:45 - and still works great and I'm hoping it
83:47 - still work great for like two to three
83:49 - years so yeah that should be uh should
83:52 - be a fun
83:53 - one having a problem where the debugging
83:56 - lines don't match up when debugging
83:57 - attach Unity I try cing the build Del
84:00 - the library cash anything else are you
84:03 - doing something with dots cuz if so that
84:05 - is a known bug how dot says okay there's
84:08 - an error online 128 but it's really
84:10 - online 130 something like that so if you
84:12 - are talking about dots that is a known
84:14 - bug so I don't think there's anything
84:16 - you can do about it you can just look at
84:19 - lines that are nearby instead of looking
84:20 - at just this specific line if you're
84:22 - talking about non dos then I'm not sure
84:25 - what is the thing I I don't think I've
84:28 - ever had issues with like debugging with
84:29 - different lines so so yeah sorry I'm not
84:33 - not sure if it is non dots then yeah if
84:36 - it is dots then yeah it's a it's a known
84:40 - uh issue with it I've had that issue
84:42 - myself where it says happen on some line
84:44 - but it's actually on nearby line so when
84:46 - you have that the solution is really
84:49 - just if it tells you that it's on this
84:50 - line don't take that for granted look
84:53 - above and below and any of those might
84:55 - have the line that has to do with how
84:57 - dots in the background does a ton of
84:58 - source generation and all of that Source
85:01 - generation basically it has to uh hard
85:04 - code in the intermediate compiler it has
85:07 - to hard code line numbers so that it
85:08 - tells you the correct line numbers but
85:10 - apparently sometimes I get messed up so
85:12 - it says here on some line but that's
85:14 - because the source generation messed up
85:16 - and section different line so yeah the
85:18 - only option that I know is really just
85:20 - look on a the similarly related line and
85:23 - hopefully you should find the the
85:29 - issue any advice for Iranian beginner
85:32 - Game Dev uh the advice is the same as
85:35 - for anyone else so really if you want to
85:37 - learn then kitchen chaos course really
85:39 - awesome one so if you are a beginner
85:41 - start that one maybe watch my uh cop
85:44 - course if you want that so yeah those
85:46 - two are really awesome beginner things
85:48 - just depends do you want to make a game
85:50 - or do you want to focus on the language
85:51 - itself both are really great starting
85:53 - point yeah
85:57 - R my $15 keyboard for years now yeah the
85:59 - previous keyboard the one that I had
86:01 - before this one I had it for like I want
86:05 - to say like 15 years something like that
86:07 - cuz I remember that I had that keyboard
86:08 - as a kid and it only died like two years
86:12 - ago a year ago so yeah and it was not an
86:15 - expensive keyboard so yeah I'm guessing
86:16 - I paid for it some like 15 bucks 20
86:18 - bucks and it's somehow that keyboard
86:20 - survived for literally 15 20 years so
86:23 - yeah
86:24 - it's quite amazing how some things just
86:27 - seem to last quite a lot so yeah it's a
86:30 - nice one part two not course be ready
86:33 - soon I'm currently actively working on
86:35 - it so the answer is yes soon as to when
86:38 - soon I'm not sure perhaps on this week
86:40 - something like that so yeah I'm
86:42 - currently researching writing testing it
86:44 - validating and so on but yeah so around
86:47 - this hopefully should be something like
86:48 - that should be a nice
86:50 - one do you have many Portuguese people
86:53 - in the channel I'm curious how many
86:54 - Portuguese DS are making games I think
86:55 - that would be interesting to see that is
86:57 - a good question I think the answer is
86:58 - like 3% let me look at my
87:02 - analytics uh like
87:06 - audience or
87:11 - geographies uh try moving this
87:16 - one look at that so this for the in last
87:19 - 30
87:20 - days so us up top with 70k then India
87:24 - Kingdom Turkey Germany Russia and
87:27 - looking at Portugal I'm guessing it's
87:29 - there you go down here so I guess 0.6%
87:32 - so it's a bit less than I thought but
87:34 - still 3,000 people that's quite a lot of
87:36 - people so yeah that's uh uh pretty nice
87:39 - so yeah definitely the uh but it's a
87:42 - nice mix I like that so it's not like
87:44 - there are some channels that are like
87:45 - 90% us I like how this one is quite a
87:48 - bit dogs are getting hungry yeah he's
87:51 - walking around everywhere uh so I like
87:54 - it's a nice mix so us India UK turkey
87:57 - Germany yeah really nice mix of
87:59 - countries and you have Portugal over
88:01 - here on 0.6 yeah pretty fun pretty
88:06 - nice
88:21 - uh right there something a bit of fun so
88:25 - no man's Skai loading system debug so a
88:28 - fun video showing a debug camera moving
88:30 - super fast no man's Skai where you can
88:32 - clearly see their loading system in
88:33 - action and importantly see how fast it
88:35 - is so here is the video so uh someone
88:39 - with loading time smoking mirrors and
88:42 - how in reality this one doesn't actually
88:43 - have that much smoking mirrors like it
88:45 - just moves a camera super fast it is
88:48 - super fast just loading all the all the
88:51 - things there's all those flashes which I
88:53 - think it's actually loading something
88:55 - and you can see how the terrain streams
88:57 - how the level of detail how the trees
88:59 - start coming in so yeah but it's quite
89:01 - insane how in 20 seconds you can go from
89:04 - one one world which is all loaded into
89:06 - memory somehow unload all of that load a
89:09 - completely different world with a
89:10 - complet different biome and somehow do
89:12 - all of that super fast and the whole
89:15 - thing running on a PS5 right
89:18 - here it's definitely quite quite insane
89:22 - the loading system they built for this
89:24 - so yeah it's quite an amazing thing I
89:26 - mean if you try doing this by default
89:28 - you are going to encounter a lot of
89:29 - issues so this is definitely a very
89:32 - amazing thing so very impressive
89:38 - yeah on these don't care much about
89:40 - cutting patterns clean code just trying
89:41 - to make the thing instead of trying to
89:44 - understand how the thing have to be made
89:46 - they will make the Indie dream I mean
89:48 - technically when it comes to code
89:50 - quality technically you can't build
89:52 - anything with bad quality code but but
89:54 - if you write bad quality code the
89:55 - chances of you ever reaching the end of
89:57 - that project are much much smaller as
89:59 - opposed to if you write proper code if
90:01 - you write dirty code you can always
90:02 - build something tiny that's that's not
90:04 - going to be an issue but if you make
90:06 - anything relatively complex like if you
90:08 - were to make no man's Sky if you were to
90:10 - make that without any concern for code
90:11 - quality you would never finish this game
90:13 - you would get to a point where you just
90:14 - get drowned in a ton of complexity you
90:16 - would never reach the end you would get
90:18 - to a point where you can't just add more
90:20 - mechanics you can't just add more things
90:22 - because anytime you add one thing you've
90:24 - got to modify a billion different files
90:26 - and you just get all completely messed
90:27 - up so yeah technically you can make
90:30 - anything work with bad code but the more
90:33 - complex it is the more that becomes a
90:35 - really difficult task so yeah you don't
90:38 - care about clean code and patterns until
90:40 - you experience your own foot gun injury
90:42 - so yeah that has definitely happened to
90:44 - me quite a while I did spend quite a
90:45 - long time not really worrying too much
90:47 - about quality of my code just okay if it
90:50 - works it works and eventually what I was
90:52 - saying was actually happening to me as I
90:54 - was trying to make more and more complex
90:56 - games I was figuring out that at the end
90:57 - of development things were becoming much
91:00 - much more difficult uh to develop like I
91:02 - remember making Survivor squads I
91:06 - remember in the end trying to make the
91:07 - boss fights and all those things how it
91:10 - was such a mess so difficult to do all
91:13 - this AI like if I had a proper code base
91:16 - I could have made all of these uh all
91:19 - these complex systems interactions that
91:22 - would have been much much easier to to
91:24 - make if the code base was actually solid
91:26 - but the whole thing was quite a mess
91:28 - although it wasn't as much a mess as
91:30 - when I tried cuz by the time that I made
91:32 - this game I already had like uh six
91:35 - years of experience making games so yeah
91:38 - I already had a little bit but still the
91:40 - code was definitely not I was definitely
91:42 - not super focused on code quality and
91:44 - that did definitely like Ben said yeah
91:47 - you definitely get your own foot injury
91:49 - you're going to shoot yourself in the
91:51 - foot so yeah I definitely did experience
91:53 - that and since then I definitely gained
91:56 - more and more of an appreciation for how
91:58 - to write good clean code and if you do
92:00 - that that is the only way you can make
92:02 - complex games like I could not have made
92:05 - dinky Guardians if I was not
92:08 - crap I could not have made this game
92:11 - without focusing on code quality this is
92:12 - a very complex game tons of systems all
92:14 - of them interlocking all of them talking
92:16 - to one another I could not have made
92:17 - this game without concern without
92:19 - thinking about code quality if I was
92:21 - Runing dirty code this game would simply
92:23 - never be finished so yep that is why
92:25 - nowadays I'm constantly talking about
92:26 - clean code it's because I did experience
92:29 - what it's like to not worry about it and
92:31 - I did experience these sufferings I did
92:33 - shoot myself in the foot many times so
92:35 - yep that is why nowadays I'm very much
92:37 - like
92:43 - that RTS build space and surface combat
92:45 - yeah I mean making oh is this one
92:48 - playing sound oh crap I hope that
92:49 - doesn't mess up the
92:52 - stream uh so if you want to make a giant
92:55 - game some like total Annihilation an RTS
92:57 - like that you definitely do need to
92:59 - consider loading quite a bit because it
93:02 - is going to be uh quite a
93:08 - challenge just ignore me too that works
93:11 - sorry I'm trying to keep up with all the
93:13 - comments live stream after to use I'm
93:15 - using
93:16 - OBS actually right here on the side
93:20 - there you go look at that Inception uh
93:24 - yeah OBS really awesome free software
93:26 - it's quite it's quite amazing how this
93:27 - is free it's like definitely quite an
93:29 - insane thing such an awesome software so
93:31 - useful so used by so many people and yet
93:34 - it is complet free so yep definitely a
93:36 - big fan of OBS uh it does pretty much
93:39 - everything all the
93:42 - time uh so yeah this really fun video in
93:46 - a few seconds you can easily load and
93:48 - unload multiple completely different
93:49 - planets along with all the levels of
93:50 - detail in all the objects and if you pay
93:52 - close attention you can naturally see
93:54 - some popping so loading is fast but not
93:56 - instant and the grass rain detail of
93:58 - that rendering showing up but in normal
93:59 - gameplay it just looks beautifully
94:01 - perfectly smooth so yeah if you really
94:04 - pay attention frame by frame you can see
94:06 - terrain popping out look at those
94:08 - objects disappearing the terrain slowly
94:10 - fading away look that a different level
94:12 - of detail for the terrain mask that one
94:14 - showing up and as it zooms in yep you
94:16 - can see it starts to show the clouds
94:17 - then shs to show some terrain then
94:19 - terrain merging into another terrain
94:21 - then different level of detail then
94:22 - start showing all the particles and so
94:24 - on so yeah so if you look at it you can
94:26 - see things streaming in and out of
94:28 - existence but yeah in normal gameplay
94:31 - you really don't see it just because it
94:32 - is so insanely fast and looks really
94:34 - awesome look at that going to another
94:36 - different one loading all the things and
94:40 - Yep looks perfect insanely fast insanely
94:42 - performant that is definitely quite an
94:44 - amazing
94:45 - one so yeah always learn I was love
94:48 - learning about tricks for how developers
94:50 - had loading 20 years ago it was all
94:52 - about long elevator r
94:54 - yeah it's kind of funny how this is kind
94:57 - of thing how I can write this over here
94:59 - and I wonder how many people know what
95:00 - I'm referring to because nowadays yeah
95:03 - for a few years now well I guess I guess
95:05 - the god of war game which came out in
95:07 - 2018 did have some tight spaces to hide
95:09 - the loading so that probably hasn't
95:11 - necessarily fully uh vanished but yeah I
95:14 - do wonder how many people remember long
95:17 - elevator rides because yeah those used
95:19 - to be all the way back in the early 2000
95:21 - because it did take some time to load a
95:24 - complete different level so yeah the
95:25 - best way is really just making a long
95:27 - elit ride add some dialogue and you can
95:29 - easily unload something load something
95:31 - else and looks really awesome but yeah
95:33 - nowadays we just need a tiny bit of
95:35 - smoke and perhaps one day things might
95:36 - be so fast we might not need to hide any
95:38 - loading at all so
95:45 - yeah chat sharp that's a that's a funny
95:49 - name yep portal to always those
95:51 - elevators really nice really cool yeah
95:55 - how do you come up with a game name that
95:57 - is a very tricky question because yeah
96:00 - coming up with a good game name is
96:02 - indeed quite a tricky thing uh so yeah
96:06 - that is one thing that you definitely
96:07 - have to Workshop it look at uh similar
96:11 - game uh look at games similar to yours
96:13 - to get some ideas maybe ask AI to
96:15 - brainstorm a bunch of uh game name ideas
96:19 - so yeah basically anything can work as a
96:21 - game but some things like for example
96:23 - change together that is a great name
96:25 - it's a very clear uh name it very
96:28 - clearly describes what the game is all
96:30 - about and it wasn't taken so yeah just
96:33 - by itself a really great game her truck
96:35 - simulator I like uh really descriptive
96:38 - names so seven days die that is fun but
96:41 - yeah if you try going for something
96:43 - super complex super unique like fields
96:46 - of mystera I don't know what that is but
96:48 - apparently it does have a th000 reviews
96:50 - so apparently it is a positive one but
96:52 - yeah if you try going for hey Min solers
96:55 - that was fun looks like that factory
96:57 - game with thing nice just 27 reviews oh
97:01 - interesting looks nice uh so yeah coming
97:04 - up with a name is always an interesting
97:07 - challenge it's always uh it's always a
97:09 - fun
97:11 - one yeah the name should generally
97:13 - describe the core concept or the idea
97:15 - yep especially for in developers if you
97:17 - try going too unique that is going to be
97:19 - tricky so usually for in developers
97:21 - going a bit more generic a bit more
97:24 - X simulator that is usually a better way
97:28 - as opposed to coming up with a really
97:29 - unique name that nobody's going to know
97:31 - how to pronounce so
97:32 - yep about to learn how to create a 2d
97:35 - turn based strategy is Unity good way to
97:37 - go yep sure I mean pretty much any
97:40 - engine nowadays is great for making any
97:42 - game so unity and Realo all of those are
97:45 - capable of making uh 2D turnbas strategy
97:47 - game so yep personally I love unity but
97:50 - yep use whatever and all of those are
97:52 - really good to work for making that kind
97:55 - of game
97:56 - yeah do a copy of Gun Mayhem
97:59 - implementing enemies that shoot and move
98:01 - through the platforms is doable and how
98:03 - much time without experience I'm not
98:04 - sure what is Gun
98:07 - Mayhem interesting shooting game is it
98:10 - an iio
98:12 - game okay so like a sid scrolling shoot
98:15 - them up game
98:17 - okay but is it multiplayer or with AI
98:21 - enemies making this in single player
98:23 - relatively easy making it multiplayer a
98:25 - bit more complex uh but implementing AI
98:28 - that shoot and move through the
98:29 - platforms is doable in how much time
98:31 - without experience I mean if you
98:33 - literally mean no experience then it is
98:35 - going to be a bit of a challenge uh
98:37 - because you do need to learn quite a lot
98:39 - of things
98:41 - uh so yeah how much time I don't know 3
98:43 - months it really depends on what you
98:45 - mean by without experience it is not
98:48 - based on the screenshots cuz I I'm not
98:50 - familiar with the game but a s scrolling
98:52 - shoot them up it is is not necessarily
98:54 - super complex but if you have zero
98:56 - experience then even making something
98:57 - like flightboard is going to be
98:59 - relatively complex so yeah maybe a few
99:02 - months but yeah definitely a a by
99:04 - looking at the screenshots definitely a
99:06 - doable project so yeah sounds like a a
99:09 - fun nice uh start project
99:12 - yeah P physics is Stu any ideas for how
99:15 - to do that mechanic for Port the big
99:17 - issue is not necessarily the physics
99:20 - that part should actually not be too
99:22 - difficult so you just have to see okay
99:25 - when this Cube or this sphere goes
99:26 - inside the portal just spawn it on the
99:28 - other place and apply the correct
99:31 - opposing physics the issue with uh
99:33 - making a portal game the bigger issue is
99:35 - with rendering like you have a portal
99:37 - and you have to render like half a cube
99:39 - over here and then on the other portal
99:41 - you have to run the other half of the
99:42 - cube so that is really tricky yeah
99:44 - Sebastian lag pretty sure he does have a
99:46 - video on that so yeah if you're if
99:50 - you're going that
99:51 - approach portal here pretty sure I
99:53 - remember seeing yeah this one yeah
99:55 - that's exactly it so yeah handling the
99:58 - visuals that is a really tricky thing
100:01 - because you have to render essentially
100:02 - two objects so yeah that part becomes
100:06 - really tricky very very complex very
100:11 - quickly yeah being able to move between
100:13 - the portals and being able to see the
100:15 - correct perspective from the correct
100:16 - angles then being able to move an object
100:18 - from here to there and so so yeah portal
100:21 - is one of those things that sounds
100:22 - relatively simple in theory it's really
100:24 - just a hole connect to another hole but
100:26 - in reality it's a lot more complex so
100:28 - yeah it's definitely one of those
100:30 - deceptively simple looking games that is
100:33 - actually very complex which by itself
100:36 - means that it is a great uh game
100:39 - mechanic to work as a sord challenge
100:41 - look at that that's fun
100:48 - nice take a look at ninja remix on Steam
100:52 - and suggest some Chang as we
100:55 - do let's
100:57 - see Ninja
101:03 - remix okay the particles look nice they
101:06 - look interesting the levels seem a bit
101:09 - oh Master unique Jus oh that that sounds
101:11 - like a a fun concept build your Clan
101:14 - with diverse ninjas and dive into
101:16 - multiplayer PVP battles or progress
101:17 - through the story all set to a cool Funk
101:20 - beat I have no idea what is a funk beat
101:22 - but I don't have a right now so I'm
101:25 - hoping it sounds nice uh but yeah I like
101:28 - the particles the particles do look
101:30 - really cool and the hand signs those
101:32 - also look really cool nice yeah
101:35 - basically how to make a Naruto game
101:37 - without Naruto
101:39 - IP uh so yeah I mean without sound just
101:42 - looking at the trailer it does seem nice
101:45 - I would only say that the visuals over
101:46 - here seem a bit too basic like this area
101:49 - seems way too empty so like I really
101:51 - like the particles but it's seems like
101:53 - the area is may be way too basic but the
101:57 - particles look good so maybe that can
101:59 - actually and I do like that one about
102:00 - the player being pushed upwards I think
102:02 - it makes it very clear what the game is
102:04 - about so in terms of mechanics I
102:06 - actually think it's really awesome I
102:08 - think maybe the visuals just need a
102:09 - little bit of a Polish over here but but
102:12 - I don't know that's just a minor nitpick
102:14 - so in general just looking at the
102:15 - visuals it does uh seem pretty nice and
102:18 - the particles and the
102:21 - screenshots uh I guess you could maybe
102:24 - have a little bit of variety cuz like
102:26 - these three screenshots all look pretty
102:28 - much exactly the same so there's a
102:30 - character doing something on top of
102:31 - grass so I guess I guess I would spend
102:35 - some time building some different biomes
102:38 - yeah the grass looks too even yeah it
102:39 - looks like this has literally the same
102:41 - height at all points so maybe that is
102:44 - why it looks so basic because yeah
102:47 - because the grass all looks just one
102:49 - uniform thing as opposed to having I
102:51 - don't know some flowers here and there
102:52 - something like that
102:53 - so yeah I would build a different biome
102:55 - one on like Desert Snow something like
102:58 - that yeah having some hills or different
103:00 - height and yeah this screenshot is a bit
103:03 - strange I'm guessing it's showing this
103:05 - character but yeah
103:08 - um remix I really like this image that
103:10 - is nice for game more strategy
103:12 - creativity and bit of nonchalance can
103:13 - make you a legend stepping into ninja
103:15 - remix build your Clan mess your Jus and
103:17 - claim your place at the top this is
103:19 - single player and PVP nice make hand
103:22 - sign called jutus that sounds nice yeah
103:26 - I do like the idea of mixing hand signs
103:28 - like one of my favorite games growing up
103:30 - was Magicka so the idea of Magicka plus
103:33 - ninjas I'm already interested in it so
103:35 - yeah that sounds nice creat your clan
103:37 - that's a nice screenshot that is cool me
103:39 - could be animated but just by itself
103:41 - looks pretty cool and G oh look at that
103:44 - you've got an interesting uh little
103:46 - biome over here why don't you have one
103:48 - of those screenshots kind of like this
103:50 - biome being standing on rocks like this
103:52 - reminds of like a DBZ screenshot
103:54 - something like that so that could be
103:56 - cool man ninika that would be nice yeah
104:01 - uh Community Driven epic yeah that
104:03 - sounds uh nice so hly in general I do
104:07 - think it is pretty good I do think the
104:10 - the uh capsule image definitely does
104:12 - require
104:14 - something uh I would say this definitely
104:16 - looks way too basic so I would hire an
104:19 - artist something like that to make a
104:21 - proper capsule because the capsule does
104:23 - mean quite a lot it matters a ton and
104:26 - this capsule does look extremely basic
104:28 - like like essentially this looks like
104:31 - something that I would do me with zero
104:33 - art skills that's basically what I would
104:35 - do just pick up uh an image of the
104:37 - character pick up the Logo put some
104:39 - blurry thing on the background I would
104:41 - do so that's what I would do but I'm not
104:42 - an artist so that that means not
104:45 - necessarily very good so I'll definitely
104:46 - hire a proper artist to make a proper
104:48 - capsule and yeah in terms of the uh
104:51 - description over here sounds nice sounds
104:53 - cool uh me personally as someone who
104:55 - likes ninjas Naruto yeah that is cool so
104:58 - yeah then I would modify a few of those
105:00 - things but in general pretty nice yeah
105:02 - now let me see cdb doino let me see
105:05 - Ninja
105:07 - remix so this one has 12 followers so
105:11 - about 100 wish list so yeah definitely
105:13 - do those changes and then start doing
105:15 - some marketing start posting some gifts
105:17 - on Twitter uh something like that cuz I
105:20 - do think the cream D jutus that is an
105:23 - interesting one so if you come up with
105:24 - an interesting title and make an
105:26 - interesting uh gift showing a bunch of
105:29 - images like a mini fight and someone I
105:32 - do think that could do well on Twitter
105:34 - Reddit maybe even on Tik Tok and
105:36 - something like that so yeah that could
105:38 - be that's what I would try to try to get
105:41 - a bit more visibility wish list and so
105:43 - on but yeah so far it looks really cool
105:45 - so yeah uh congrats on that yeah nice
105:48 - hit Subs but a lot of users want for
105:50 - mobile yeah yeah for this kind of game
105:53 - yeah it's
105:55 - uh yeah I guess some of those W one for
105:59 - PC so yeah it's always it's always
106:01 - tricky to get that like I'm making a PC
106:03 - game but people are ask for mobile but
106:04 - it's not really possible and so on so
106:06 - yeah but yeah I would say you're on the
106:09 - uh right path so yeah definitely do keep
106:11 - going cuz yeah that looks quite
106:17 - nice look at Castle yards
106:23 - step into the role of medieval Lord in
106:25 - Castle yard a captivating Castle
106:26 - Management game where your strategic
106:28 - decisions shape the fate of your realm
106:30 - manage resources train Knights and
106:32 - navigate the intricate politics of your
106:33 - court to lead your people to Prosperity
106:36 - okay that sounds like an interesting uh
106:40 - thing although it seems like the trailer
106:43 - is way too slow so in like 25 seconds
106:48 - we've seen just basally two
106:51 - images so isn't like a text Adventure
106:54 - sort of thing that does make it a bit
106:56 - hard to make a more
106:58 - compelling uh trailer so you got a bunch
107:00 - of
107:03 - resources then you go out side so you
107:05 - manage a bunch of
107:11 - things okay we got a nice jousting mini
107:14 - game that's fun nice but yeah the
107:17 - beginning is
107:18 - definitely way too slow again I'm I
107:21 - don't have sound so I don't know
107:23 - like I don't have headphones right now
107:24 - so I can hear but yeah does seem like so
107:27 - it takes like 10 seconds there you go 10
107:30 - 11 12 13 14 so almost 20 seconds before
107:35 - we see something a little bit different
107:37 - like in the beginning yeah it does look
107:39 - like a visual novel which I guess but is
107:41 - it cuz on this uh description I see it
107:44 - more as like a Castle Management game so
107:46 - like uh I don't know Kingdom kingdoms
107:48 - and castles so I'm imagining something
107:50 - top down managing a castle building
107:52 - things and so on whereas yeah the
107:55 - trailer definitely gives the vibe of
107:56 - being much more of a visual novel
108:01 - so so I would say definitely trailer
108:03 - seems a bit too a bit too slow for the
108:08 - screenshots sure they all look nice they
108:11 - have nice variety I would just say
108:14 - the over here this one seems a bit too
108:17 - basic so I would maybe add some icons
108:19 - over here for each of these so come up
108:21 - with an icon so it's not just
108:23 - text on a Col background have some kind
108:25 - of icon to make it a little bit more
108:27 - interesting so I would probably do that
108:28 - to make this pop out a little bit more
108:32 - uh for the font looks nice and the
108:33 - background art that does look nice and
108:36 - yeah icons help with localization too
108:37 - yeah that's also a very good tip very
108:40 - nice how will you
108:42 - roll the font is a little bit hard to
108:44 - read but it does match with the theme so
108:45 - I don't think that's necessarily uh B
108:48 - thing s r of medieval Lord and Castle
108:50 - yard an immersive RPG management game
108:52 - where you strategic decisions shape the
108:54 - fate of your castle and realm man
108:56 - resources train Knights and navigate the
108:58 - intricate politics of your court to lead
108:59 - your people to
109:01 - Prosperity yeah that's uh that is a uh
109:05 - nice one your choice matter you've got
109:07 - in-depth management and exciting
109:10 - tournaments so got nice little J
109:13 - boom there goes little uh
109:16 - Shield
109:19 - um so yeah although over here I would
109:23 - say you need to add some kind of bone
109:25 - letters some kind of uh okay you got
109:28 - Bonet points but I definitely add some
109:30 - bone letters over here at some point
109:32 - just because the text is too too bland
109:35 - basically just being like this just
109:36 - being normal text I'll definitely put
109:38 - some things like the cleard in bold or
109:40 - adjusting tournaments in bold something
109:41 - like that so I would add a little bit of
109:44 - uh different hey prer games hey how's it
109:46 - going uh so I definitely add that to
109:48 - make a little bit more different uh but
109:52 - yeah the images the gifts I do like
109:54 - those so yeah and the the thing over
109:57 - here I think maybe the text is a bit too
110:00 - small I do like how it is like really
110:03 - under the castle and he couldn't really
110:05 - increase the size of the castle without
110:07 - hiding the rest of this so I do think
110:09 - the background image is nice although
110:11 - the text does
110:13 - seem a bit hard to read a bit too tiny
110:16 - so very beautiful image but yeah
110:19 - definitely having uh being a little bit
110:22 - hard to so maybe I would experiment with
110:24 - that maybe experiment with some Shadows
110:26 - some thickness something like that but
110:28 - in general the image behind it is
110:29 - definitely definitely awesome so it
110:32 - could be a bit larger if you move it a
110:33 - little bit down here yeah maybe little
110:35 - bit like that uh could be an interesting
110:38 - one miss our important Saturday stream
110:40 - was on vacation yeah that's cool I I
110:43 - hope you enjoyed your vacation nice yeah
110:46 - yeah the definitely best of luck with uh
110:49 - the game
110:54 - Gary spell weer
111:01 - it or this one I
111:05 - guess in terms of visuals it does seem
111:08 - quite
111:09 - nice point and click puzzle game oh I
111:12 - got to say I'm not good with I'm not
111:14 - good at point point and clicks uh start
111:17 - with six based elements and combine them
111:18 - together oh so it's kind of like that
111:20 - crafting game something like that
111:26 - oh is this I don't know if this is
111:28 - messes up the stream or not so let me
111:31 - just put
111:33 - that if I put it in full screen I think
111:35 - it's going to mess up a bunch of
111:39 - things new
111:42 - game Heather buttons to spawn elements
111:44 - coning elements cost points drag and
111:46 - drop elements to combine them lock new
111:48 - elements on recycling bin or trash to
111:50 - clear them trash Lo point recycles funds
111:54 - most of them try unlock so right away my
111:56 - advice would be okay this seems like way
111:58 - too much text so I would definitely
112:00 - split this into parts and I would be
112:01 - like okay when I interact with this part
112:03 - teach me what this does then after a
112:05 - while teach me what this does then after
112:07 - a while teach me what this does instead
112:08 - of uh a pre-wall of text I would say uh
112:12 - yeah show don't tell definitely uh spawn
112:17 - them okay so if I and is the tool tip
112:19 - meant to be that big I'm guessing this
112:22 - this is some kind of issue possibly an
112:24 - issue with being in full screen or not
112:28 - or maybe I guess just
112:30 - the thing like that
112:36 - um oh you just click on it and then you
112:40 - mix them together where are their
112:41 - spiders am I supposed to kill the
112:43 - spiders I pick up their
112:45 - blood we got some water some water and
112:48 - crystals makes a sapphire apparently and
112:50 - burn Sapphire what does it do doesn't do
112:52 - anything so burn some dark thing and
112:57 - create
112:57 - smoke then smoke in air does do
113:00 - something nope doesn't do anything
113:04 - uh oh wasn't I supposed to see smoke up
113:08 - here uh so Dark Crystal with a spider
113:11 - can I merge with the spider no I can't
113:13 - okay the spider is eating my stuff let's
113:15 - make it dark Crystal amethyst that's
113:17 - nice amethyst and Earth does it do
113:20 - anything nope doesn't do anything yeah I
113:22 - supposed to get a bunch of things added
113:24 - up there uh we've got Earth and light
113:29 - makes the crystals light and Fire
113:31 - doesn't do anything oh it does a ruby
113:33 - nice there you go why why do some of
113:35 - them get out of the pier and some don't
113:37 - I'm not sure I understand that one and
113:41 - what are the the uh I guess they give
113:44 - you spell points something like that so
113:46 - I made clouds can I make rain clouds
113:50 - yeah I can make rain and what do they do
113:52 - do with rain going to Earth nope can't
113:55 - do anything with Earth and rain so about
113:58 - Earth and light does that give me nope I
114:01 - want to make like plants or something so
114:03 - let me burn
114:05 - some Mak lava okay that's
114:08 - fun and lava plus air doesn't do
114:11 - anything okay so let me make a cloud of
114:14 - lava nope so take lava and let's burn a
114:17 - ruby nope what can I do with lava let's
114:20 - burn something nope
114:23 - lav in more fire I guess yeah doesn't do
114:26 - anything okay some more Earth on lava
114:30 - nope we got rain oh how about if I take
114:33 - lava and add some water
114:39 - okay got some clouds rain and Ruby
114:44 - nope okay some dark dark fire that
114:48 - already try that okay make Smoke Smoke
114:50 - and Things nope
114:53 - yeah cuz some of them recycle the entire
114:55 - board oh it just takes out all of those
114:57 - gives me some kind of thing I can
115:00 - destroy elements I can see hints Earth
115:03 - with Crystal oh that's nice I do like
115:05 - having a nice hint system so I can make
115:08 - an emerald dark with lava didn't I try
115:11 - that and didn't
115:13 - work oh obsidian nice can I mix two gems
115:16 - no catalog so all the recipes W 16 out
115:20 - of 400
115:23 - uh oh it's scrolling up and down so this
115:25 - would be nice to have some kind of uh
115:28 - bar just to be able to see okay have I
115:30 - scroll down enough am I not okay not
115:33 - sure but yeah I do like the the uh the
115:38 - uh hint system just because I always
115:40 - suck so let me try putting fire and
115:43 - water makes alcohol really Fire and
115:46 - Water okay I guess uh an Earth with dark
115:50 - what is that going to do it's going to
115:52 - make some Stones
115:54 - nice only had two weeks of making yeah I
115:56 - mean this is really awesome for for two
115:59 - weeks or even more than two weeks uh it
116:01 - does does have quite a lot of content I
116:05 - mean with 400 recipes I'm guessing you'd
116:07 - def find all of these things using
116:08 - scripal objects and all the recipes
116:10 - using scripal objects so it's really one
116:12 - of those games that is very content
116:14 - heavy trying to do quite a lot of things
116:16 - fire water yeah uh so yeah I'm guessing
116:20 - this one of those games that the
116:22 - mechanics themselves I'm guessing you
116:24 - probably made those relatively quickly
116:26 - but then trying to work quite a lot at
116:29 - building all the recipes all the
116:30 - possible combinations make them in a way
116:32 - that makes sense makes interesting but
116:34 - yeah it's definitely definitely a a fun
116:37 - interesting game so yeah congrats on
116:39 - building this for the for the uh uh game
116:42 - Jam did this get like uh submission
116:48 - page so did it finish already I don't
116:51 - know the uh so like does it have a score
116:55 - yeah a bunch of people really liked it
116:56 - extremely well made for game Jam yeah
116:59 - really awesome yeah that is definitely
117:02 - judging is still going on oh okay nice
117:04 - all right but yeah definitely looks like
117:06 - a good one I have no idea what the what
117:08 - the theme was what was the
117:13 - theme the uh theme shadows and anemy
117:16 - okay so yeah definitely does make sense
117:19 - so it does indeed match up with the
117:21 - theme so yeah nice yeah yeah I I hope
117:23 - the voting does well it's
117:29 - cool find recipes in Google Sheets and
117:31 - Export to Json then automated script
117:33 - objects using ASD Creator now that is
117:35 - awesome that is a really cool uh usage
117:38 - of uh external tools and then building
117:41 - your own tools to help you develop your
117:42 - game that is definitely really awesome
117:44 - so yeah yeah congrats it does look like
117:46 - a really nice game especially for being
117:48 - built in two weeks that is definitely
117:51 - really cool so yeah congrats on the game
117:53 - really nice um okay so yeah song rating
117:57 - oh wow it's almost seven oh I didn't
117:59 - know it was so late so yeah my dogs are
118:02 - walking around as you can probably hear
118:04 - so yeah uh going to go and do something
118:09 - and so
118:10 - on by the way for those of you who are
118:13 - channel members I do the
118:17 - oh
118:18 - [Music]
118:20 - um uh
118:23 - I got
118:25 - the oh that's what I didn't even know
118:27 - what I was looking for but
118:31 - yeah for those who are channel members I
118:33 - do have the the uh live streams every
118:36 - Saturday so I'll be doing that tomorrow
118:38 - so if you do then check the uh members
118:40 - Discord and you'll find the link for the
118:42 - live stream for tomorrow so yeah
118:44 - basically I've been doing those
118:45 - consistently and I do hope to be able to
118:48 - do some more uh of these public live
118:51 - streams uh in the future uh so yeah
118:55 - should be fun should be interesting and
118:57 - yeah if you're interested in seeing up
118:58 - to date definitely check out the Game
119:00 - Dev report I should put uh publish
119:02 - another one on Sunday I've been pushing
119:04 - that out so yeah if you want to read the
119:06 - news definitely look into that sign up
119:09 - and yeah it's a fun way to stay up to
119:12 - dat start new Project Unity and found
119:14 - the fastest version is 2019.4 wow really
119:18 - that is pretty old I would say 2019.4
119:22 - isn't even efficiently supported so I
119:23 - would definitely use something a bit
119:25 - later but yeah I mean I guess if that
119:28 - one is the fastest version I guess
119:29 - depends on what you're doing I would not
119:32 - release a game on that version just
119:34 - because it seems like it's way too old
119:35 - that's like 5 years old now so that
119:37 - might have issues with compatibility but
119:39 - you could definitely build the entire
119:41 - game like that and then one month before
119:43 - release then upgrade to the LTS version
119:46 - and be pretty nice so yeah roughly
119:49 - that's what I would do okay um
119:52 - oh there's
119:58 - some all right okay so oh yeah and if
120:02 - you want speed then using the hot reload
120:04 - asset that can definitely help out quite
120:06 - a little bit uh okay so let me put this
120:10 - like that and so on and it should be fun
120:13 - let me pop this back how do I pop this
120:16 - back there you go like that uh all right
120:19 - so yeah thank you all for being here and
120:21 - I hope you have a great rest of your day
120:23 - weekend and if you remember then I will
120:25 - see you all tomorrow all right so yeah
120:27 - have a great rest of your day and I'll
120:28 - see you next time all right bye everyone
120:59 - for
121:06 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

e all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day yeah thanks for being here nice all right we are having a great what day today Friday Friday yeah are just right here all right so yeah let's read some interesting news some fun stuff should be interesting uh okay I minimize my OBS there it is been a while since I did in live stream so hope you're all doing great hope you've all been doing quite a lot of interesting thing these past few months so yeah nice he accidentally on the stream not quite accidentally just I definitely uh tried planning it honestly I tried planning it since like Wednesday but always so busy with so many things but yeah today finally managed to do a stream it's been a while since I did a a public live stream I mean I normally do the members Z live stream so if you're a member every Saturday uh remember how there's a private live stream to ask any questions something like that but yeah I haven't done a public live stream in quite a bit so yeah so this should be fun should be nice be a command to re randomize my avatar you can just customize it there's a uh I haven't made a video tutorial on it what did I call it custom character custom uh there you go how to make your own custom live stream character or rather you don't have to make a like draw you can draw if you want but you can also just go on to the website customize and you can modify how the whole thing works so that's actually pretty fun pretty nice yeah you think about the new GPT voice model not release not release what does that mean as far as I know it hasn't been out yet but yeah it should be interesting I'm in the original demo when was that like 3 months ago that was quite a while ago that was a definitely an impressive demo so yeah we'll see hey root bin hey how's it going nice yeah if you left making games nope I'm always trying to build things like just recently making the RTS for DOT score so that was a a fun game to to make and yeah in terms of proper game my last game d Guardians came out last year and yeah I definitely still want to get back to it there are still a bunch of things that I want to build upon it not to mention make a console build and all sorts of things so yeah definitely uh still want to do more uh let's say normal game development so on so yeah that should be fun get motivation to code but stream pop up let's see what happens here sure I mean you can make a 5 minute detour to watch the stream and then go back work on your code do your thing so yeah combine both a little bit you know make a nice break then go back to work that's uh should be a fun thing hey Gabor hey how's it going terminal hey everyone all right okay so yeah so by the way this is the game dep report I don't know how many of you know about it it's on the pin comment this is what I've been publishing like every single week for the past I don't even know when did I start the end of May so May June July yeah so I've been doing it for 2 and a half months basically every week sent out a newsletter with a bunch of news so if you want to sa up to date with the latest in Game Dev teen gaming definitely check it out so here let's uh read the last one which actually had some uh really interesting things so yeah that should be fun can I work on a game on Steam when I don't have Steamworks and the account holder only got Steamworks not sure what you mean by that uh the only person that needs Teamworks is the person uploading the the uploading the build but without that he can still work on the game so so yeah I'm not sure what you mean what when are you switching to gdau I definitely do want to try out gdau at some point so yeah no idea when but definitely something I have in my in my uh in my todo list my very massive todo list that is constantly very massive it's always way too big always got way too many things to do but yeah definitely do want to do same thing for making beginner tutorials more beginner tutorials more more tutorials in general all kinds of things so yeah definitely still want to uh do lots of things jaw exercises no not really as far as I know those don't really work so yeah that's a it's a not quite a thing yeah how' you learn to speak English quite simply by watching Cartoon Network that was kind of the well and by programming since everything related to programming is in English but yeah I spent a big portion of my childhood just watching Caron Network and it did have did not have any subtitles or anything like that so I was just watching I thought it was fun and I would learn a word here and there and eventually after while after spending a ton of time on the internet programming and so on so yeah basically just learned it uh let's say not intentionally so like I was constantly interacting with things in English and by that I sort of randomly learned and yeah by now honestly nowadays English Works my brain works more in English than it does in Portuguese which is kind of a fun thing kind of an interesting thing so yeah uh that's uh that's an interesting thing uh okay let me just uh read a bunch of things then get back to some your questions something like that and yeah last week I saw Deadpool and Wolverine pre fun movie that was quite nice I really enjoyed it I haven't seen a Marvel movie since like uh endgame so I haven't seen a Marvel movie in like 6 years or something like that or I guess I saw that P to which I guess came out after that but anyways just saw it really interesting and it does make me make me think makes me want to build a game where the character Never Dies so how would you make a mechanic like that interesting cuz basically if the player character Never Dies then it's kind of hard to make it a compelling thing I mean if there's no loose condition then it's kind of hard to make a compelling experience out of that but yeah that's definitely an interesting G game design question how to make a game that somehow works when the player does not die so for example the enemies could keep moving uh after taking out the player so some kind of open world game so the player is I guess some kind of immortal vampire something like that and a bunch of enemies come in they take out the player and then the player just stays there on the floor while the enemies keep rolling around going on their on their own path on the open world I think it could be a fun one so basically the world exists outside of you so you pick a bunch of fights and the enemies take you out and eventually you come back to life and keep roaming around I think that could be an interesting one or simply just taking a score penalty when dying so just a simple one or maybe they don't die but lose all upgrades or items so definitely a bunch of interesting possibilities when it comes to building a game where the character does not die that could definitely be an if you're interested in a game design challenge then that's a a fun challenge try to make something where the the character Never Dies the player Never Dies and somehow find a way to make that compelling so yeah when you die the enemy level up their stats that's a bit of a tricky one cuz then becomes like a a snowball of difficulty so you die once then the enemies are more difficult increase the odds of you dying again which then and so on so yeah it could be interesting as long as you then have some sort of catchup mechanic like in um uh what is it called Mario Kart where if you are way too far behind you get like a speed boost in order to make things semi competitive so you could do something like that so like the every time you die the enemy levels up so the enemies become super strong but the stronger they get if that cap becomes way too big you can then give the players some kind of bonus some kind of special thing in order to catch up then when they catch up take away that bonus and things like that so that could be that could definitely be an uh a very interesting approach so yeah if you want the game design challenge this would be a fun one yeah6 will you update the 70 features course yep I'm constantly thinking about ways to update that course it's one of the many things that I'm constantly thinking about so yeah although not necessarily Rel to Unity 6 there are still many nonunity 6 uh featur that I very much would like to cover so yeah like for ex the navigation package that one has been that one has updated quite a while ago and I haven't yet looked into it so I definitely would like to make el on that same thing for sin machine because sin machine 3.0 just came out just a while ago actually like now when you install in machine it automatically installs 3.0 which honestly is a bit annoying just because I'm already so used to using 2.0 so I really like I already know how it works so just put it and everything works great so I really like s machine 2.0 but yeah definitely got to spend some time looking into 3.0 because 3.0 is a massive update and apparently oh it was last year oh I thought it was a few months ago but no apparently 3.0 came out almost a year ago wow that is uh quite crazy yeah but yeah um so 2.9 got a last update in August of 22 and then yeah made 3.0 which is a massive change so yep anyways one of the many things I eventually would like to cover so that should be uh quite fun quite interesting yeah D two you're losing XP by dying really oh interesting I don't think I've ever played the Alum 2 I only played the Alum 3 so two yeah I don't think I've ever played two but yeah definitely definitely an interesting uh game okay so let's see and actually uh suddenly This Game Dev report starts out with a sort of a bummer news game inform forer ends after 33 years so it really really sucks but I mean for a new Sprint magazine to be alive still in 2024 that is honestly quite a quite an impressive thing but uh yeah so game form one of the most subscrib gaming magazines that started all the way back in ' 91 has just published its last issue and on the website they have just a farewell a bunch of messages 30 33 years which is actually quite a lot for a for a news organization like that that was definitely a big one so yeah for the last three decades they provided indepth coverage reviews and all sorts of insights into the game industry it was always a the big thing for a game to get covered on the front page of Game Informer which yeah I remember uh reading uh all kinds of news websites like I never I don't think game inform forer had a physical Edition here in Portugal so I'm pretty sure I've never seen a physical thing but I do remember reading websites like gamasutra and they would always uh mention okay this game has a really interesting thing on the cover Game Informer so yeah it was definitely a big thing although suddenly it appears website has been completely wiped and only has a fwell message I hope this is just a temporary thing because it's just happened hopefully in the future they will have the website back as a nice archive at least you can still find it on the way back machine so yeah this really sucks like they had so much information on the website but when they died it literally just end up just like this so just post a message no links no nothing although thankfully oh no oh oh crap did I not post the correct URL no I didn't it just this one kind of messed up the link address does it is the UTM yeah it's probably the UTM that breaks it are okay I think it's still yeah cuz this one had the website had so many things on there and thankfully does since it was a very popular website does have a lot of screenshots on the Wayback machine but yeah it definitely does suck how the official website just dead no memories no nothing so that really does suck so yeah that was a a thing why don't you reply on my comments I'm trying but trying to read reply to comments doing everything at the same time it's a bit tricky so I'm trying having a hard time getting better at programming C any tips I'm so poor I can't afford your course any tips I mean you can follow the if you're talking about the C course there are free videos over here on YouTube so learn C so if you want you can definitely follow this is the beginner one this is the uh intermediate one so you can go through those and eventually within what day is it 9 so around I don't know like 15 16 18 around this time maybe over here on a Monday so maybe on 19th of August I won't publish the video lectures for the advance section free here on YouTube so anyways even if you don't have any money you can definitely learn a lot from this and uh where was the comment and basically getting better just involves a looking through some tutorials in order to learn what does c do what can C do learn all the Syntax for all the things and uh hey yeah have fun at work yeah uh so first learn the syntax follow tutorials in order to learn that but then you have to actually apply it so when it comes to getting better at programming C or honestly literally anything you learn the thing and then you have to actually apply that thing so you have to write a bunch of code do a bunch of mini games a bunch of prototypes a bunch of mechanics a bunch of systems a bunch of random programs all kinds of things basically the more code you write the better you become so yeah learn how the code Works learn the syntax learn all of that and then spend some time actually putting that into practice I mean that is a big reason why in the course I to find the the uh the uh interactive exercises it was specifically for that so you can actually learn by doing and those interactive exercis those are a crap the ads those are part of the uh premium version of the course but over here on the free version I still made sure to include all the titles for all the exercise let me just skip this so at the end of every single one there you go it shows this thing so you can okay this one doesn't have size let's go over there onto the variables one there you go so if you don't have the premium version you can just look at these titles and you can basically do do some work yourself in order to figure out the answers to all these so what exactly is a variable why data typ is important you can do some kind of exercise to change a unit speed so change some kind of variable define a speed variable double some kind of variable and so on so even without paying anything you can just watch these three videos guide yourself to do all this work enter all the fqs do some exercise quiz but essentially at the end of the day it's really only about experience so the more code you write the better you become so write a ton of code and you w become quite a bit better so in general that's what I would say prob work your free course are probably best s that's awesome hey I'm glad people enjoy the courses and yeah as long as people keep enjoying them I will definitely keep making them so that's nice uh how long did it take you to plan out the code structure for the RTS do Score says Rook I'm amazed how you came out with Solutions i' never uh two months maybe yeah yeah something like that a month and a half to two months something like that was how long it took me to build the Prototype so basically first I had to spend a bunch of time myself learning learning all about dots so reading reading the entire documentation reading all of their they have a really awesome dots ebook Unity dos ebook and I think it's this one yeah like a 50 page ebook so I definitely recommend uh it's over here the link no it's not that it's this one yeah so a really nice ebook telling all about dots so I spent a bunch of time going through this I spent a bunch of time reading documentation spent a b bunch of time uh watching all the videos on dots that I could find on YouTube all kinds of things then of course like I was saying a while ago at some point you have to put into practice so I did all that all that research in order to learn how it works then I started building a prototype so I started experimenting with a ton of approaches and yeah eventually I did find the final structure but again keep in mind whenever you watch one of my tutorials or really any kind of code any kind of game whenever you see that keep in mind that you are watching you are looking at the final version of that thing so for example when you look at my dots scor the code that I'm teaching there is not the code that I initially came up on the first R so I first make a prototype get it working and then I iterate upon it I modify all kinds of things until finally reaching the final thing so basically what you are watching is essentially like version I don't know 30 or 40 of the initial code that I first did so so I never plan out the code perfectly from the beginning I plan out something I start building prototype start building something and then just constantly iterating upon it until it finally reaches something that is uh pretty nice yeah first stream C vis a ton nice yeah I'm GL my vide home nice so yeah that is uh awesome okay so let me uh just keep reading okay so yeah on the topic of game forer which is I guess a positive way to look at it is how it's actually amazing that they last this long so really three decades on a print magazine especially considering how YouTube has grown so much so yeah nowadays there's excellent stuff on YouTube so review channels like game ranks interview channels like no clip and deep dive channels like Ai and games so yeah if you want to learn I definitely recommend at least e like Ai and games this is a really awesome Channel they've got such super detailed uh videos specifically on on AI so like the one on fear that one is really awesome there was one on the AI in Watch Dogs and Legion I think it was that was really awesome so yeah a lot of excellent uh videos if you want to learn all about Ai and no clip of course if you want to see documentaries really well produced documentaries and yeah coming soon design of dredge so that's an awesome game so that should be a fun one so yeah if you like watching uh uh game documentaries then definitely recommend this channel definitely really nice so yeah here in Portal we didn't have Game Informer but I do have for memories of reading a few Mega scores so yeah this was like the uh local thing meas score magazine can I find some images nope ah oh not store score there you go nice local magazine a bunch of games oh that was the heart dark that was nice that was a fun one yeah a bunch of stuff that's what Tomb Raider legend oh that one nice so yeah so this was the local magazine here in Portugal uh for a long time and B Gamer that was another one that was also that was also fun so yeah anyways here we did not have gameing form but we did have that and yeah I remember being a maaz reading an article for an upcoming game where the graphics look in wishable from real life and it was the eldest Scrolls for Oblivion and yeah it's really funny how uh I mean I don't know how many of you are roughly my age but yeah when I was a kid and looking at games I definitely didn't look at a game like this and I thought there's no way this this can be better there's no way this game can ever look better than this uh steam power.com because yeah it really is a I mean nowadays looking at it you can obviously see that this looks quite dated but back then this looked insanely realistic I remember looking at it and thinking holy crap I wish I had a PC that was able to run this this looks so beautiful so perfect look at that oh man Oblivion that was a really awesome game I did play it for quite a long time I definitely did all the side quests everything so yeah definitely an amazing game it was quite impressive uh how good it looked back then so yeah this came out in 2K7 yeah quite a long time ago and back then it did look quite amazing so yeah it's uh it's a shame game forer shut down but yeah nowadays there's lots of places to get uh lots of news lots of things so yeah that should be uh fun think of the illen isolation of alen I see that it's Prett genus I've never actually played it just because it's sort of a horror game and I don't do well with horror but I definitely do need to play it just to uh check out the AI and I'm pretty sure that Ai and games I'm pretty sure uh he did a video on it so um let's go alien I'm pretty sure there was yeah there you go alien a alien isolation so yeah I think it was actually no I thought it was one of his first videos but apparently not 15 but yeah I definitely remember apparently saw this video so this one was probably awesome so yeah I've never played it but it does look quite amazing and it's especially great from the context of being in AI that makes the player feel things so it's not an AI that is like insanely clever but rather it is really good at making you think that it is extremely clever so yeah if you want to look at awesome AI definitely do play the game uh watch this and yeah it's uh definitely one of the ones that is usually given out as the example of okay this is excellent top tier AI definitely do that for dynamic typing or static typing me personally I really dislike VAR now again whenever I say this I have to say that's really just personal preference there is absolutely nothing wrong with VAR so if you like VAR definitely go ahead and use it but yeah for me personally I I really do not like VAR just because I think it makes the code much less readable I like V yeah that's oh hey Daniel it's you hey how's it going uh yeah personally I really dislike VAR just because usually it makes it it makes it not well I guess not usually it depends on how you're using it like if you're using VAR as like grabbing a a variable that is a return of some kind of function I really dislike the fact that most of the times I cannot tell what type that thing is so I'm calling some function I have no idea what the function returns just by looking at the function name so I have no idea what type that thing will be so that is why personally I really like being extremely explicit so I really like saying okay this is a type in it's a list of object it's a game object that say something so yeah personally I really don't like bar I really like being extremely explicit about what types I'm using it but there that's really just personal preference so there's absolutely nothing wrong with VAR so if you like using definitely use it but me personally I won't keep being as explicit as possible because yeah I definitely do prefer reading the code like that yeah speak to in private you can send me an email but lately I've been getting way too many emails so that is quite tricking feels like you're playing with an alien in not a dum AI yeah I mean that that is that right there is the perfect description of what an excellent AI is like you forget that you're actually playing against a computer opponent you're just really enjoying something that is compelling you're just enjoying a very compelling experience and not worrying about okay there's some code running background no it's really a creature that is actually attacking me so yeah kind of like that why to improve my channel uh maybe I'll check it out later okay is n6 fully released nope right now it is still in the what do they call it preview so yeah not yet but it should be coming out later this year I'm assuming it won be coming out sometime around uh unite which by the way I will actually be at unite so if any of you are coming to Barcelona I willon be there so go ahead let me know it should be a fun time so there's a bunch of things and they've actually just published the session list so if you want to see all of the sessions they're going to have all things like one on accelerating the creation of your competitive multiplayer game okay achieve your vision faster with technical ARS tools and un6 so yep they've already published uh all of the uh talks they're going to have so if you're going to uh unite definitely check that out and if you see me there yeah come come ahead and say hi Oh Daniel you're doing a talk nice that's cool yeah I will definitely go there what is it about can I find it here if I search for your name does it show up uh there you go connecting dots let's make a game with entities okay that sounds fun that sounds nice fors fundamentals to entities 1.3 give you a bird's eye view of the API landscape today through a HandsOn live tutorial with ECS s will Empower you to explore the API and build the confidence to continue your ECS development Journey all right that sounds awesome yeah I'll definitely be there that is definitely a a topic that I'm interested in so yeah should be fun yeah I hope you're preparing well should be nice definitely looking forward to it Peak Performance okay that's a that's a great theme that should be fun hey the qus hey how's it going right uh was I yeah uh uh okay let what oh let's see I thought the page was cut off but something like that mind the Observer and facade patterns in my project instead of having scripts communicate with each other directly interact through a single script that serves as a facade class what do you think of this approach uh when it comes to names of design patterns that is always something that confused me so the facade pattern I'm not 100% sure I remember what exactly that is is that like an interface so you have like an interface and with the Observer pattern you are communicating with the interface instead of each other directly just a wrapper okay so I guess I just don't understand exactly what you're doing so you've got the Observer pattern which is really just events so you're publishing something listening to something so then you've got the sound pattern so you're using some kind of some kind of thing to the okay so I'm not sure how you're using it but single script to communicate with oh so you got like a main event manager and then you are like uh listening to that main event manager instead of having different objects listening to them themselves is that what you mean if so that can definitely be a valid approach uh personally I do prefer to register directly with the event but yep having an event manager and basically anyone that listens to events talks to that one and anyone that publishes events talks to that one basically you have an intermediary in between those twoos that can also work so yeah personally normally I usually just connect to the event publisher directly but having the event manager in the middle that can also work uh quite a bit getand does a lot of good videos on patterns nice and yeah actually speaking of patterns one of the things that if uh that I want to cover in a little bit is Unity actually has an excellent uh little uh project that they put out on the assur alongside a really nice uh uh what's it called really nice ebook and yeah talks about solid principles design patterns so yeah in a little bit I want to I want to go through this and just in case you I'm pretty sure I had a tab here nope not that one nope nope nope there you go that one so if you want Unity has that awesome one so yep definitely do this a great ebook it's quite amazing how un has so many awesome ebooks so much information so yeah if you read through all those ebooks you're definitely going to learn quite a bit and uh yeah this one is actually uh quite an amazing thing uh yeah problem I forgot coding syntax how they are declared is my memory problem by me do you mean like you forget the syntax for C sure if it's a basic syntax like how do I Define a function yeah that's just something you learn with the experience so the definitely just write more code that is usually so kind of like the question that I was answering a while ago the answer is really experienced so really just write a ton of code and eventually it becomes Supernatural this is how you define a function this is how you define a variable property class whatever so yeah when it comes to basic syntax it's really just a basic memorization but when it comes to problem solving every problem is always different so when it comes to problem solving it is not about memorizing Solutions it's about becoming better at problem solving but then when it comes to syntax sure memorize that and in a little bit you should be able to memorize quite a lot of things yeah okay let me just uh keep going because there's actually quite a lot of interesting things so yeah the second story is start small and stay small and actually about a really interesting red post on a topic that I personally very much agree with so that is the post is titled why I absolutely love making small games and why you should do it too so the goal is start with a small scope making small games so that's really common device but then keep doing exactly that so you don't have to graduate to making multiyear games making multimon games you can really keep the scope small and really just keep building fun small games forever so this is definitely advice that I really like uh because personally at least for me it doesn't really I don't find it very appealing to spend like five years making a game I really much prefer making five games in 5 years as opposed to just trying to go from one massive one all at the same time some people really prefer that I do think that is a much more high risk potentially High reward option so personally I do prefer the slightly low risk of making five games in 5 years cuz then you have essentially five uh five chances at making a game that does find success so personally I definitely do prefer this advice of small scope making small games and really just stay there so you don't have to graduate to making multie games you can just always keep making small games and this example this post written by one developers behind minim Lane so that's a really nice cozy game that has been very successful and he mentions a bunch of benefits and one of the main benefits is simply cost so basically if you spend 5 months working on a game you'll likely just need a couple hundred or a few thousand cop sold to break even whereas if you work in a game for 5 years you'll likely need tens of thousands of sales which is really tricky to achieve so yeah the faster you make your games the more efficient you are the more smaller scope you make it the much easier it is to make profitable games so not just finish the game but actually make the game and being able to make enough money so you can make the next game and so on so yeah that is one big reason why small games are really awesome and making multiple smaller games also helps you T out lots of ideas and maybe one that people enjoyed where you can spend more time working on a sequel so you can put out tons of games in like every 6 months then one of those maybe people really uh Vibe with that idea they really like it then he can take that one and he can spend let's say one extra year working on either a SQL building upon it something like that because basically it is really difficult to find something that scks something that resonates with a large amount of people so that it can be successful so if you do find something like that then yeah definitely working on it pushing it Forward I do think that is a uh an excellent strategy so use this make small games to test out ideas and then if you want if you really want to make a game that is like a multiyear game then at least I would say test out lots of ideas to find out one that does have the potential to find success when you make it for multiple years so yeah the post very well written explaining lots of benefits of this approach definitely give it a read and yeah this one does have it's a Prem massive post it's all really nice so yeah this one is from the developer of minim M which was actually a very successful game look at that 2.9 th000 reviews this is one of those cozy games you run the street and it's all really nice and it has really beautiful colors so it definitely is Chill cozy Vibes just have some fun characters some fun things so yeah sometimes hard to think of small ideas well the main one for that is really just think of not a big idea but think of a normalized idea and then just break it apart into pieces so like for example this game maybe the big idea would be something like Sim City where you have an entire city with tons of NPCs and you talk to all of them so this could be an example of a small scope out of that big idea so basically you take the entire city and you cut it down okay no I'm just going to make just one single uh Road of this city so really just a handful of buildings instead of building the entire city just build that so when it comes to making small ideas think of a normalized idea and then just break it apart into all the pieces and really just make something much much smaller very focused so instead of making something with 100 mechanics focus on just five of those and make those work really well so that is probably a a great way to come up with small ideas so think of something like GTA and then think okay no I'm just going to make the the driving I'm just going to make missions I'm just going to make like a poli Simulator game like a uh what do you call them like the ambulance game sort of thing like GTA is a huge game has all those mini games and each of those mini games could by themselves be uh one complete game so yep start Le game development St learning coding one week ago nice yeah that's cool have month to prepare for my university project okay wow that that took a turn that took a jump you started learning one week ago and you have one month to prepare for university project okay I feel like it's missing a little bit there but okay how should I start and from where and how could I learn okay so if you want to learn where's my tab where's my tab uh definitely check out my uh where's my cuz I didn't call it kitchen cows watch my there you go my free kitchen chaos course definitely go ahead and watch that it's 10 hours so technically you won't really be able to learn all of that in just one month but you'll be able to gain quite a bit of knowledge so that's what I would say but yeah one month for university project I have no idea how complex that university project is but yeah not sure how you start coding just a week ago and suddenly have just one month to prepare so yeah that won't be uh quite something anyone can give a g idea how do you generate a good game idea had this question in my head forever can you give some tips I do I love your vide so much nice and that is a very tricky question that is essentially the million dollar question so if you have a way to guarantee that you have good ideas then you would basically print money because the idea is such an important thing when it comes to a game being successful or not so when it comes to that the basic idea or I guess the better way is come up with a ton of ideas and then depending on your knowledge you have to be able to analyze what EX makes a good idea and how do you do that is essentially you just look at the uh steam page you go and see what sells so basically you see for them down here new and trending so you go over here and you see all of these games so all of these that are on the popular new release all of these are doing at least decently well so you come up with 100 ideas and then you study this page you refresh it every single day in order to see what games sell what people want to play and then with that over time you get a better sense for what kind of games can sell and specifically what kind of level of quality the average person on team is expecting so as you can see the the uh competition is definitely very Fierce so the amount of games look at these awesome games coming out literally every single day what is that knock on coffin oh a card game with vampires I guess anyways so yeah lots of variety all of them is really awesome so that is something that you learn over time as you analyze so meaning not just play but actually analyze okay why is this game being successful as you analyze that you get better yourself at being able to identify what is a decent idea versus an excellent idea but at that point but even if you do that you still don't have a guarantee of a good idea so then what you do next is you really just test out the idea by there are many ways but one of the easiest well easiest quote unquote is basically make a bunch of gifts a bunch of short videos and just put them on Tik Tok Reddit Twitter whatever just make a bunch of tiny things put them out and see what the reaction is like if you post on Twitter and you get zero likes that might be an indicator it might be an indicator that either the idea is not very compelling or it might be an indicator that you simply were unlik and then reach that's the issue where with testing you can't fully test you can only slightly test so essentially if you put it out on Twitter and you get 10,000 views on a brand new account that is definitely a clear sign that there is uh interest in that idea same thing if you go and redit if you go on take it out and so on if you make a Tik Tok short video basically a prototype your game like a mini visual vertical slice if you do that and goes viral then you know okay this idea definitely has something on the other hand if you put it and gets like 10 views that probably uh means it doesn't have way too much so yeah when it comes to testing ideas first uh grow your own skills of being able to analyze what the what sells on steam or uh I guess what players want to want to buy for me personally I work mainly on seam so that's my focus or but you can say what sells on seam what sells on mobile what sells on console something like that so develop that thing and then come up with a bunch of ideas and test them out so uh that's how I would do it l oh yeah for mixing uh ideas yeah good artist Copic great arst steal best artist steal for multiple sources to high tracks yeah basically combine multiple things so yeah if you want to if you want an idea that has better odds of finding success yeah definitely take two already successful games and come up with your own uh mish mash of that gen def uh do something like that so yeah com L buying a 5x P plus hard valy yep all of those three very successful games so that is quite nice try to make a game development Studio or do you prefer solo I'm really not good at managing people so yeah for me making a proper game development Studio probably never going to make that although who knows perhaps one day in the future I will work at a studio meaning I will not be the one in charge I will just be working alongside other people maybe that could be fun but but yeah uh building my own Studio being in charge of building my own Studio yeah that that requires way too many management skills which is definitely not the kind of skills that I have so yeah that is uh and yeah game studio is slowly dying off because they can't make enough money making games anymore that is also one of my benefits of being a Sol developer I really don't need that much money in order to make a living whereas if I was a studio with like 10 developers to pay all of a sudden even small games become really expensive and need to sell tens of thousands of copies whereas as for example on my own thing like I talked about the results for dinky Guardians so this is looking at the reviews this is a pretty regular game it's definitely not a hit game definitely not a hyper success but definitely more than enough for me to uh pay my wages pay my living so yeah being a Sol developer or a small scale developer also makes it much easier to make profitable games although of course that doesn't mean that I have to do all the work so pros and cons kind of like that the 20 Game Challenge yeah I just heard about it recently and actually really awesome one and uh yep there you go this one it's really awesome a really excellent idea uh I was told about it from someone on the private Discord uh a while ago and it's really awesome basically it's the idea of building a ton of simple games well simple two complex games just build a ton of games specifically 20 games and you will learn quite a lot so I definitely do do think this is an awesome thing so yeah if you're looking for challenges for games to make definitely look at this one building simple games or not even simple building any kind of game is always going to give you a ton of experience a ton of knowledge so yeah definitely a big fan of this concept and yeah honestly my longterm plan is to eventually have video tutorials on making a bunch of these simple games I would love to do that so I would love to have a free 2hour course on making pong another one on making FL bird making breakout uh asteroids that's an awesome one lunar lander that is really cool uh Mario Bros just just a basic one but worms that would be fun that would be nice super M that would be cool making Doom Maybe Minecraft yeah that could be interesting and yeah so yeah if you're looking for uh basic games to to build to grow your skills definitely go ahead follow this uh this uh website which has a really nice list of nice simple games to to do so yeah I don't Ser too personal but would your games provide enough in come for you alone not including YouTube Etc yep I mean I did make my games for how long I started this channel in 2018 and I started making my first theme game in 2013 so I guess for five or six years uh yeah I was making a living just from my game so yeah specifically for my use case specifically for living here in Portugal where uh in the beginning when I first moved out when I first started Living on my own I was living on like €750 a month so yeah I could essentially make a game in one year and make more than like seven Grand off of it so yep thanks to having very low cost yep I was definitely able to uh make a living from my games hey CPU hey how's it going nice uh new project would you prefer Unity 6 or previous versions considering how Unity 6 the proper final version is almost out about to come out I'm guessing it's going to come out like I was saying a while ago it's probably going going to come out during unite which is going to be in uh when is it I was tab uh unite is going to uh there you go late September so I'm guessing around this uh time they are going to either publish unit6 final version or give a date for it so yeah if I were starting a project right now yep I would definitely use the current un6 version and then upgrade to the LTS version whenever that one does come out so yeah that should be it should be nice in what could case in what case should you buy assets well in the case that you need something that you probably can't do uh can't do yourself so in my case I am not an artist so for me when it comes to visual stuff yeah I'm just going to buy assets I'm just going to buy animations textures visuals so yeah you can use assets either to supplement your skill set so basically help you fill any kind of skill apps you have or essentially really just you okay I do have the skill set of being able to make like some kind of pathfinding system but making a proper one is going to take a ton of time so let me just buy an asset and just save a ton of time so yep either play skill Maps or save time those can be great ways oh reply to you okay yeah I'll check it out in Li yeah thanks for your reply I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that conversation seeing different viewpoints definitely an interesting topic uh about way more project management I don't make too much project management uh specifically talking about in the context of like making uh game design documents usually I don't do anything too complex I just make some simple high level overviews and very quickly start building a prototype so that is usually how I do it so nothing too insane I don't make like 20 Page 20 pages of designs and making uml diagrams connecting this and that usually I don't do that just make something simple hand L overview and then just start start building a prototype and really iterate from there so yeah when it comes you project management in that sense of Designing the entire game just design a little bit and then constantly itate upon let make a horror game I very much in theory I would like to just because just to test out the the uh uh the theory that uh Chris has said multiple times uh Chris over here yeah why every Indie Dev should make horror game so I would like to try out that theory to see if horror games really do have a relatively easier time of Finding Traction and relatively easier time of actual building game so from that so as an experiment I would like to do it but yeah I am not a fan of of playing horror games so that would be a very interesting one like can someone who does not like horror games build a good horror game I guess that's an interesting question but yeah eventually I very much uh would like to experiment with that that would be fun code question I get the same transform from the children of a parent in my queries not having a parent works but how do you get the transform of a child in dots so in dots for all the children those are all if you look at the parent uh not game object for the parent entity it's going to have an array it's actually a dynamic buffer uh it's called CH or something like that I think it's like the child array and inside it's it's an array so it's an element that contains all of the uh children so yeah not having a parent words how you get the transform of a child yeah so then you can cycle through all those entities then on those entities you can access the local transform which is going to have the local values and then it just becomes a little bit tricky if you want to convert those local vales into Global although I think that the uh the local transform I think that one does have a function in order to basically do that mat convert a local transform into Global so yeah essentially that cycle through that component that uh Dynamic buffer and it should be uh quite nice nor only BR s of horr ask uh it's more stry it's more well it's as much horror as some like XCOM I guess which yeah does have some pretty scary zombies but doesn't have any like like in yourr face uh scary flashing things so yeah it's definitely more strategy than horror but yeah I guess it does have zombies so ores is your Fitness going do you see any improvements yeah it's going pretty nice I mean just uh just a while ago I did a really nice challenge where I did a bike ride for 127 km so that was fun I spent like 8 hours on a bike going nice and chill nice and relaxing so yeah that was fun spending an entire day on a bike that was definitely an interesting really really nice one and uh yeah just a while ago I hit my my bench PR of 120 kilos that was fun and just like early this week I was doing 110 kilos and it was pretty easy to do five reps so yeah hopefully hit a new PR uh sometime soon so that should be that should be fun um okay so yeah so on the just read the TDR so again I really recommend you watch uh oh is this oh wow this one has a limit does it yep it does have a limit so I can't post such a long link that's funny that's funny uh uh so yeah really great post on making small games and why you should do it too again that is also very much my advice start small and continue small Ione like it so T what time you have on your personal funds better to make a few games than make no game or making just one giant game so basically if you have X number of years that you have savings spending that time making multiple games gives you more chances at finding success as opposed to just one so that's really awesome and refund rates are not high on Tiny games so if you make something that is only like 4 hours long as long as it's good the refr rate is really going to be the same that's usually one criticism that people have of tiny games which is oh they're going to play it for like two hours four hours they're going to play like half the game refund and so on but turns out most people don't really do that so you can even make a 2hour game as long as it's good then yeah like for example a short hike yeah this is a great example I think this game is like less than two hours long but there you go overwhelming positive view oh wow that is literally 99% positive wow that's insane that is cool uh so yeah definitely and uh yeah people playing for 6 hours 7 hours 4 hours 1 hour 8 hours 3 hours so yeah basically the idea that small games get higher refund rates thankfully that is not really thing so you can definitely make small games and won't uh be a negative impact and yep you won't make your dream game but believe you'll make something better yeah for me this is an interesting one because I don't necessarily have any kind of dream game I've got a ton of different ideas that I very much would like to build but no dream game specifically I actually made a video on that topic yeah I'm making my not dream game on how I don't really have dream game I just have a ton of different ideas that I very much would like to wouldn't like to build so as I as I imagin myself like 70 years from now when I'm 100 I want to look back and be able to see okay I made like 50 games that are all really interesting really different as opposed to oh I just made five masterpieces I guess I don't like the idea of making a ton of stuff as opposed to just a small amount of things this game but tiny such an easy pitch yep that's also like a while ago we were talking about how to come up with ideas and the one% didn't like a short hike that's a good question uh so yeah it's an easy pitch to say it's just like this game but much smaller much more focused so yeah coming up with ideas for small for simple games for small games that can also make it much easier to come up with interesting ideas making small games makes your indie game death life and mental health so much better yep I would say being able to basically finish games much more quickly so it's relatively easy to stay motivated on a single project for like 3 months it's much much harder to stay motivated on just that one project for like 5 years so when it comes to that when it comes to being able to deal with yourself oh yeah gmtk finish mind over magn yeah I I saw that video I haven't or I saw the video on my recommend but I haven't actually seen it but is it actually finished or or or okay so oh November yeah so I'm guessing he's doing a bunch of Polish and yeah this is also one that took him quite a lot when did he uh when did he start this one uh my magnet on SE I think the first one was called your first C game did he do it okay so this was kind of like his prototype when he made the or nope yep that's developing two what's developing one uh did you make it or was it that one okay maybe it was that one anyways it was around around here that was two years ago so yeah he spent over two years so two to three years making a a really interesting puzzle platformer at least he like me personally I'm not it was after the flight Bird video so yeah that was um where is it I'm not seeing flight burn but yeah anyways around this like 2 3 years so yeah I mean in his case he started essentially from zero as far as I know he didn't have any previous uh Game Dev experience so yeah spending two to three years building a complex like this cuz it does look complex even though it's a platform it does have a bunch of interesting mechanics and it made a lot of interesting stuff in terms of well building the entire art himself so that takes quite a while so yeah definitely uh an interesting steamdb doino to see so if we see mine over magnet and let's see how much is it it's on 2,000 so around 20,000 maybe 30,000 wish list so yeah although this one again for all of you watching keep in mind this does not mean puzzle platforms are easy to find success chances are this one will find success because a he has a huge audience and B he's actually been doing a ton of play testing so I'm sure the final game will actually be good because he's been having a ton of people play it and improving on the feedback and doing all those things so he has been iterating a lot so I'm pretty sure the final game will be good in terms of gameplay but if you yourself are making a puzzle platformer I would definitely carefully caution you against that just because puzzle platforms are really difficult so essentially this one is essentially going to be uh the exception that proves the role so making a successful puzzle platform is really difficult this one is likely going to be successful but don't use that as an example of saying okay this one is going to sell uh 10,000 copies so mine can also sell 10,000 copies now that is actually uh quite difficult but uh yeah with uh 20 to 30,000 wish list hopefully the game willon be good hopefully it won't be successful so yeah that will be I'm definitely curious to play it just see it should be uh quite nice soon videos on dos course getting out soon keep up the good work yeah thanks I'm glad you like the videos uh yep I've been researching like for the next uh update I'm going to be covering the animation system and I think I'll also cover a bunch of buildings so I've been looking at my my prototype that I built in order to see all the elements that I made I'm refactoring a bunch of that code in order to make the final uh course code so yeah I'm currently in the process of doing that but yeah in terms of when I'm not too sure I was planning for like the second week of this month but but it's already like the end of this so I'm not sure it's going to be that so maybe around this week maybe something like that so I'm actively working on it so definitely at some point around here it should be fun and see animation uh part so yeah animation is fun to work with so even though it's going to be relatively complex to get animation done uh it should be a fun one so yeah definitely stay tuned for that yeah plan to upload games to the Play Store for mobile if not then why uh well the why is because making mobile games is different from making PC games you've got a different input system like you've got touch instead of mouse and keyboard so that makes it different you've got different screen resolution so basically you can't really just take a uh PC console game and just Port it to mobile and just assume that everything is going to work properly now it does require quite a bit more iteration on that so that's one reason then another reason is mobile is even more difficult than steam like the in terms of uh how crowd it is like on Steam uh you can see Steam developers complain about steam all the time because steam has like 20 20 new games coming out every single day on mobile that is like 200 games so yeah steam is already crowded and mobile is insanely crowded so on mobile essentially if you don't have like an advertising budget it is really difficult to make it so yeah those are usually my two things I don't know too much how to how to do marketing on mobile how to find success with mobile game and in terms of input it requires quite a lot of reworking quite a lot of refactoring so yeah because those things I really just stick stick in my Lane so stick making PC games hopefully console games stick with that uh doing something like that yeah that's about Y6 I've only been using it a little bit but so far seems fine haven't had any crashes everything works pretty fine so yeah it's all really nice although I haven't uh use any of the new graphics features I haven't touched those yet so yeah definitely do want to give those a try but so far it's been Prett pretty nice so yeah M you can talk with Publishers yeah I guess if you have a publisher that does know the market and they can help you actually bring that that game to Market that caned help although of course with a publisher you've got you've got to give an amount to that polisher whether that is a good or bad deal that really depends so as with so many things when it comes to polishers there are good ones bad ones there are ones that can probably be really good and ones that can probably be not very good so yeah finding which one of those again you got to know that world and me personally I really do not know that world so yeah have any materials on inverse kinematics yep I do have the one on animation briging which is the the uh rigging the uh there you go which is Unity to for making um uh ah crap I hate the I'm used to having premium I'm used to not seeing any ads uh yeah so animation riging this is unity's uh package for doing inverse kinematics so you can do a bunch of constraints put a bunch of targets and yeah you can do a bunch of fun stuff and at the end you can make the simple thing so just making a weapon follow any kind of thing so so yep if you want to make some uh animation riging definitely uh go ahead and do that yeah y do has something you would not recommend for beginners and uh yep that is correct I do not recommend for beginners I think dots and ECS is really awesome really cool but but yeah it's definitely an an advanced tool set so uh yeah like here on the on the course page like I said this is not a B level course so dots is an insanely powerful tool I definitely recommend you learn but only once you're in the intermediate or Advanced stage if you're a beginner then do not worry about dots at all just focus on learning the basics with game objects and normal C an example you can follow my beginner kitchen CH course or my C beginner to advance course to learn those Basics to get the intermediate level and then once you get to the intermediate level or if you're there already then yep I highly recommend you learn about dots so essentially when it comes to dots for beginners nope don't worry about it just stick with game objects you can make pretty much any game with game objects so you can do all that and then once you feel comfortable and once you would like to explore a tool that has a lot of really awesome positives at that point then yeah you can start learning about dots and basically get a new tool in your tool bound but for beginners sck with game objects don't worry about dots yeah your water intake a day 4 liters a day uh it's been a while since I counted but yeah it's roughly around 4 lers that I drink per day yeah pretty much that's about it basally I got a mug and that mug fills up with about 300 and this thing is about 750 I think so yeah that plus all the water that I drink at the gym plus all the water that I drink at the middle of the day yeah roughly around 4 lit a day which is a pretty nice amount it's pretty cool it's nice to be it's nice to be hydrated I guess uh bench max it's uh 120 kilos which is pretty heavy it took me quite a while to get to this point so yeah it's quite crazy at the same time to see people like Larry Willams just easily warming up easily warming up with my max bench but yeah it's a it's a fun journey I remember back in the beginning when I started I was doing it with like five kilos on each side of the bar so 510 uh I was benching just 30 kilos and it was pretty heavy and yeah now being able to do 120 that is definitely feels like a nice fun achievement so that could be uh that was nice think about the future of VR is an industry that won't grow should I start in VR or X that is a very good question I think yes I think it it's an industry that will grow but like if you go back like 5 years ago people were expecting VR was going to essentially just flight the the moon when in reality it's been a very slow and steady uptrend so yes it is still growing as far as I know but it's a very slow growth so in the future it won be bigger but it won't necessarily be like 10 times bigger so it w keep growing there is an interest in that personally I'm a big fan of VR and I think both VR and X are I think those are really good although at the same time with apple coming into the um the thing with the Apple Vision Pro which actually made a a can't open it uh with the Apple Vision Pro people thought okay this is going to save a ton of things was see I did one of these uh talked about the Apple Vision Pro don't remember which one but yeah essentially with the Apple Vision prop we're expecting okay this is going to really blow up but in reality nope it did not blow up it just sold a little bit so moved up a little bit but at the same time uh meta is currently working on the meta Quest Pro or uh sorry The Meta Quest 4 and also a new iteration to The Meta Quest Pro so lots of interesting things and yeah definitely is an industry that I do think yeah VR is also used a lot in maintenance for big manufacturer yeah I do think in terms of Industry VR is going to grow more than it does in entertainment I think that is probably going to be the thing in terms of Industry maintenance working with big machines or education sort of things like educating doctors and stuff like that I do think the industry is going to grow quite a bit more in those areas and when it comes to entertainment it's going to be a much slower smaller run so yeah that is roughly my view I do like VR I do think it's great I do think it will continue to grow but we not have an insane uh grow just like that uh incline bench I really don't like incline so I've never really tried out uh my Max on incline so my Max is like I don't know like uh 2030 60 80 so like 80 is like the most that I normally do cuz I really don't like incline just I don't know it's a it's a it's a strange one I don't feel too confident so yeah normal justu uh normal bench yeah hey artam hey how's it going yeah want to learn how to combine different program languages on the same project can you give me an idea of a small project combine C++ C and python I mean for that goal you don't necessarily need any specific project literally any project can be and you can be like you make one mechanic with C normal in unity then you make another mechanic in Python although how do you can you export python into a dlll something like that or can you I guess you can run python directly inside Unity so I guess actually that could be easy then on C++ you could make some kind of uh some kind of liary and important C so yeah I guess you could do that just come up with some idea and just split it into multiple different uh mechanics so yeah flppy bird that could be a good one so maybe make the bird jumping up and down maybe write that code in C for the pipes maybe write those in C++ and then for the UI for calculating the score maybe write that in Python so yeah that could could definitely be a uh fun one yeah should be nice okay let me just uh keep going here yeah this was fun yeah so on the one about start small and say small yeah m is a big fan of making small games as opposed to spending 5 years working on your Masterpiece I believe you'll learn a lot more by making multiple three to six months games than spending years on a single one especially if you are a beginner my advice is don't spend more than six months on your first three to five games make more games make them faster and you will learn a ton very quickly so this actually something that I didn't mention up here which is also the rate of your learning I really do believe you'll learn a lot more by finishing multiple projects as opposed to just making one massive project something that I've said many times is how unintentionally one of the awesome things that I did in my Learning Journey was just spending my five years that I spent making Flash games like in those five years I made 40 flash games so that's 40 40 and yeah I really do think that helped my learning process quite a lot making so many games and making so many games that were very different so it wasn't like 40 games those were wrong like top down Shooters no I made shooter games I made simulation games management games I made racing games I made all kinds of games and I really do believe that building all those games all that gave me a ton of experience which gave me a ton of knowledge so that is another reason why I'm a big fan of this strategy start small and stay small is because by making multiple games you'll learn a lot more than making just one giant game so yeah definitely a big fan of that host are participa in the game Jam Thor just had his uh there are more than a few coming up this month yep yep I definitely would like to host a game gam that is something that has been on my ideas list for many many years but yeah being able to organize game gem is a ton of work so technically yes I would love to but I'm only so busy with so many things so coming up with organizing a massive thing if I want to do I want to do it properly so I would want to properly organize not just say okay here's the game Jam go out do your thing no I would want it to be something quite a bit more properly so yeah eventually yes but don't know when so I guess uh we shall see to make your dot scor free if yes then when I'm planning to make the first few hours of the course free so like if the entire course in the end ends up being I don't know like 30 hours long I do plan to make like the first 10 hours free on YouTube so that is essentially the goal so that is partly why uh on the course itself I focused on on the first few lectures focusing specifically more on the on the court things of dots and the 11 lectures on more spec specific things more specific to this game so that way when I make the free version on YouTube you'll be able to learn a lot about the general things of how dots works so if you want to learn just for free just that one will be more than enough and then if you want to learn about this specific game all those specific uh features you can then pick up the entire thing but yeah you can see here right in the beginning starts with all the setup and so on then learning about not subc baking how that works how to create a component how to set up the the unit how to do a basic system how to work with physics how to get the mosor position how to click to move so click to move somewhere how to convert into job and so on dots physics recast and yeah so basically I made sure in the beginning to include as many different dots things as possible so that even people who just uh follow the free version they can still learn the dot stuff and learn how to use this really awesome tool in their own games because yeah it is a really awesome tool really nice a video covering how to proper destroy objects with dots I'm I mean uh no I don't have any specific video on that although I'm not sure what you mean by properly destroy in theory you just destroy the entity and everything gets destroyed it only becomes slightly complex if you have like parent child relationships but even at that point if you destroy the parent everything should be destroyed so nope don't really have anything specific just because that usually should should be relatively simple depending on what you're doing so yeah that you've got your bearings and thoughts that affect your thoughts on its ideal use case anything harder easier than expected uh well in terms of in terms of my thoughts didn't really change too much I thought dots was awesome whenever you need Extreme Performance and I still think it is awesome whenever you need Extreme Performance so I guess the one thing that changed in my mind was like when they first announced it like five years ago it looked like the best thing was going to be okay just make games either full dots or full game objects whereas now it is very clear no the goal is a hybrid workflow so for some things like for example DUI really don't make UI and dots that really doesn't make much sense so keep building your normal uis just using Game objects but then for things like you've got an RTS you want to control tons of units those units should probably be dots entities if so they benefit quite a bit and once you learn how dots works it is actually not necessarily harder or easier than game objects really just a different way of doing things so so yeah when it comes to ideal use case anytime you need Extreme Performance I think it's a great thing or if you just uh if you just personally really enjoy working on a data oriented design if so then yeah dots is also a really awesome thing so yeah it's really just another tool in your tool belt and I do think it is an excellent tool for a lot of use cases specifically when it comes to Performance so yeah it should be fun if you make a thown shooter yep you just call uh en manager. destroy the entity and there you go it just gets destroyed so yeah usually should be uh pretty much just like that would you make like procedural mesh generation with probuilder like multiple rooms with like one mesh I'm not sure with probuilder well I guess I mean technically with prob Builder you can call the functions so technically I guess you could although that seems like a I don't know probuilder is usually made for actually building the things uh inside the editor and not that necessarily for building things dynamically although again technically you can cuz you can call all the functions but yeah personally I wouldn't really do that if you want to do procedural mesh generation I would really just work with the mesh itself just work with the vertex array and modify those I would use those instead of trying to make it work with probuilder so I don't think that would make things easier I think that would make it more complex but if you want multiple rooms in like one mesh normally when it comes to Pras generation the easier way to do it is make a bunch of prefabs for all your rooms and then instead of dynamically generating those rooms instead of that really just pick a random room then connect another random room then another random room and so on so you're not randomly generating like entire meshes you're just manually generating a bunch of pieces for the prefabs and then just connecting random pieces together and that uh Works quite well so yeah that's usually how I prefer to do that oh it's right the anti antic command buffer yeah if you're uh cycling through entities that is not the if you're trying to destroy an entity that is included within the query you're going to have an error so yeah definitely do use a an anti command buffer in order to do it afterwards yeah recently got hot reload have you tried it nope I'm pretty sure I did buy it I think but nope I haven't tried it yet it's one of the many assets on my list that I very much would like to try because I've heard great things about that one I think that one is even like an official uh like Unity uh what do you call like supported Unity something uh acid unity.com I'm pretty sure it's actually yeah there you go with the popular asset yeah verified Solution that's what I want so yep I've heard great things about it I haven't used it but I have heard great things about it so yeah look at that nominated for the awards fun wow that is that's a big difference nice uh yeah very good so yep I haven't used it but it does look really awesome so yeah try UI tilit or stick to yugui in unity I'm planning to adapt it not sure I have tried it and for example for my C course the the companion project that I built is this I don't even know see. my C course for this one I did make the entire companion project so all this all these custom windows that I made for the uh making the quizzes the exercise the things all this I made in UI tokit and was actually really nice I really enjoyed working with it it was definitely a nice experience definitely much better than using IM GUI for building editor windows so yeah that was definitely much better but when it comes to real time ingame UI for that I'm really just going to stick with un UI this is a big upgrade when compared to I am GUI but I think un Y is really awesome I really like it so I really don't see a reason of changing from that one so yeah for edited tools I will definitely use u toen in the future but for uh normal uh ingame UI I will keep using uni just like that yeah programmer's guide to Art no I haven't seen it that sounds like an interesting topic yeah definitely want to our art nice I haven't seen it yeah I'll add this to my Q thanks for the tip they for me my best uh my best trick when it comes to Art is just buying assets so yeah if I was able to produce something a bit better that would be uh nice um of course I learned that there are some very useful uh packages like s machine Sprite CD input system Etc what basic packages do you recommend to include I mean those are basically the ones that you mentioned so yeah the sprice package I wonder why that one is not installed by default makes me wonder is there any game that does not use the Sprites package that seems very strange cuz even 3D games they have UI elements so I don't know why that one is is is not built into the engine but anyways yeah that's one that I install all the time C Machine yep always and input system yeah whenever it's a more complex project I also use that so yeah other packages I don't know I don't think anything else specifically those are all really awesome ones so yeah beyond that uh TD TD Sprite Yep this one I really don't know what it seems like you always need the Sprite editor window for something but anyways so out of those yeah when it comes to the essentials that's pretty much it first why is this installed by default oh it's used by the universal RP oh I didn't know that that's nice that's fun see C Machine really awesome and yeah when it comes to the general ones that are used for all things and yeah those are basically it I mean I guess if you want to use super fast code maybe in the mathematical Library so you can do things with the job system but that feels like it's a bit more uh of an intense use case uh maybe spines maybe that could be interesting I haven't used it too much but the little that I've used did seem like an interesting one and yeah so for those uh those are indeed the general ones that I would always uh install in6 prevent Found Real Time lighting urp broken when you use it from Custom Sky Box okay I'm not sure because I have not used a custom Sky Box so really is it broken like over here I've got this is Unity 6 but yeah it doesn't have any Uh custom Sky Box so yeah it's not going to have any issues uh but yeah anyways uh so nope I haven't experience that so I'm not uh sure I make people hear about my game on Steam uh the answer is well the answer is marketing so Twitter Reddit Tik Tok YouTube uh literally anywhere you can find anywhere you can tell people about your game that is the answer there is no single bullet there is no one single thing uh it's really just yeah talk about your game as much as possible make some compelling shorts on YouTube some compelling Tik toks and hope that one of them goes viral and gets you a bunch of wish lists and then hope that those wish lists convert which then helps you find success so yeah it's very much a it's very much a case to do a ton of stuff hopefully some of it sticks and then hopefully some of that uh gets you quite a bit of uh success well Unity 6 at this point we're still testing it out right now would say fully in like if I were to start a new project right now I would definitely be using Unity 6 I mean it's probably going to reach LTS version within the next few months so yep and it seems pretty stable I haven't had any issues I've been using it in a bunch of projects and no issues it's fast works fine so yep definitely seems like a uh pretty good one okay so let me just uh yeah so another news so subscribe to your mouse so this was a very strange one so Logitech the company that makes tons of peripherals is apparently thinking about selling a mouse with a subscription service the forever Mouse this was very strange news the idea being that a mouse requires software updates so doesn't yeah I don't know know uh but the hardware does not need to change so in order to support constant development of those software updates they cannot sell something just once so is this premise correct does the mouse require updates since they work by default even without their special software it tells me those updates aren't really required I'll replace my mouse when it stops working I think I've had four different ones in 30 years so in my case I really I do know that uh Logitech they do have their special software thingy uh but but this doesn't feel like it is necessary like it's only necessary for like setting up lights changing DPI and so on so basically with this I installed this just because I have to then set it up to 800 DPI and that's really about it so yeah technically there is software but it doesn't feel like it's a requirement so when I read this news that was my main thing so does a mouse really require software updates it does feel very strange anyways but yeah one interesting tidbit of information that inter for you was when says how only about 50% of people use a mouse and a keyboard today which I guess makes sense given how prevalent touch devices are nowadays but me as someone who use desktop 95% of the time I find that that fascinating so yeah for me I definitely use mouse and keyboard uh all the time so whenever I'm here on my desktop or when I'm on my laptop so yeah for me I do find it fascinating I mean I would assume that it is relatively High the people that don't use it just because uh mobile phones and lap and uh tablets those I've gotten so so much better but still 50% that seems quite crazy like I can't imagine doing any serious work on a touch device at least to me that but I guess not everyone is a programmer so not everyone needs specific typing of things so I guess for more simple just talking about things I guess just such devices work well so but yeah that was definitely a an interesting set on how it's 50% that seems actually uh quite high so when it comes to software we are never going back so Photoshop is a subscription Unity is a subscription office as well but for Hardware especially a mouse I can't imagine people want that so yeah and I think since uh since I wrote this I mean this news came out like last week and since then I think they have posted out a statement saying No this was just an idea we're not actually going to pursue it so thankfully it seems that people weren't really interested in in uh subscribing to their Mouse so yeah thankfully it seems like this one is not going to really happen we don't want software RS either yeah but sadly for that one I think that one uh that one has been settled there are more than enough people paying for it either happily or unhappily so yeah I really don't think that when it comes to software those are going back even if people dislike it like I wish I could just buy Photoshop ones and that's it but nope I don't think that one is going back but yeah thankfully at least when it comes to Hardware hopefully this will really take hold so yeah I use my g915 keyboard G 920s webcam and a Pro Wireless which is kind of funny I it's like it it wasn't necessarily intentional but I did end up with tons of Logitech stuff just just by accident and I really like it so yeah I mean uh these are really good but I definitely would not like having to pay a subscription for it that would definitely be a strange one uh although no matter how much I like it how much I like my setup I can't imagine paying a monthly subscription so this idea sounds very strange to me I also have no interest in an AI powered Mouse with tons of extra lights profiles features that they have nowadays I just set the DPI to 800 to 1,000 HZ Z the RGB and that's really it so yeah when it comes to me really no need for complex software for my mouse as long as it works as a mouse uh it's working perfectly fine for me so yeah this is a definitely quite a strange one yeah [ __ ] is good enough never going to pay yourself for Photoshop nice yeah yeah if uh you find something with a better service model better business model that works then yeah definitely do go for it and yeah it's uh it's definitely awesome to not have to pay 60 bucks a month but yeah for me I got used to photoshop I got used to Premiere so they kind of got me yeah sadly that's uh how it goes what might the use yeah it's the blue yeti which I've had well I've had for literally since the very beginning of this channel so yeah I've had it for uh well I guess since 2013 so I've had it for a very long time and some works it's a nice microphone seems to work pretty well so yeah pretty uh pretty nice one yeah Le the Advan seop course uh they go somewhere in the middle of this month so probably on a Monday so probably yeah probably on here probably on the 19th something like that so yeah that's that's a plan so it should be uh around that use the pendy injection I recently started using zenj dependency injection uh not quite just because when when it comes to Super hardcore testing usually I don't do too much usually I I try to make my my code testable without actually writing tests so since I don't actually write tests I don't necessarily need too much for dependency injection but I definitely do use a ton of interpace in my code so technically if I wanted to do it technically I could do it so yeah I don't really use it but I could use it and uh and yeah zenject if you're doing something uh pretty complex then that using a proper API to do dependency injection that can definitely be a positive thing so yeah that is a a great tool to learn how to use yeah have a few friends that have expressed interest in Game Dev but are starting totally from scratch do you have video series you'd recommend for absolute beginners uh I would say oh man I've got way too many tabs oh if you want to learn about C then my uh free C video or my C course that would be great but if you want specifically about Game Dev uh or beginner I've got my kitchen chaos 10hour course which a lot of people seem to run love so I'll definitely use this love you hey love you too yeah thanks for being here uh so yeah this one a lot of people really enjoyed this video it's probably my most successful video on this channel so yeah uh for beginners this one's really awesome starts from the absolute beginning until making a nice fun game uh so yeah definitely start with those either that one for C specifically or that one for learning how to make a game from start finish yeah guys great nice yeah I'm glad I'm glad people like it hey Ward hey Brazil so what time is it in Brazil I guess minus eight hours 6 hours something like that so I guess like midday yeah yeah what uh said 120 m is having a 10mth free you pay annually but I think uh price for miles is Pro game price uh yes with difference being that I guess after uh one year you still have the mouse whereas with the subscription you paid for one year and after one year if you stop paying you'll lose it so yeah for me I'm a big fan of buying things and then keep using them until they stop working so for this Mouse yeah I'm guessing this mouse is like 100 bucks something like that but I've had it for over a year I think so yeah I guess I've already paid less than 10 bucks a month and still works great and I'm hoping it still work great for like two to three years so yeah that should be uh should be a fun one having a problem where the debugging lines don't match up when debugging attach Unity I try cing the build Del the library cash anything else are you doing something with dots cuz if so that is a known bug how dot says okay there's an error online 128 but it's really online 130 something like that so if you are talking about dots that is a known bug so I don't think there's anything you can do about it you can just look at lines that are nearby instead of looking at just this specific line if you're talking about non dos then I'm not sure what is the thing I I don't think I've ever had issues with like debugging with different lines so so yeah sorry I'm not not sure if it is non dots then yeah if it is dots then yeah it's a it's a known uh issue with it I've had that issue myself where it says happen on some line but it's actually on nearby line so when you have that the solution is really just if it tells you that it's on this line don't take that for granted look above and below and any of those might have the line that has to do with how dots in the background does a ton of source generation and all of that Source generation basically it has to uh hard code in the intermediate compiler it has to hard code line numbers so that it tells you the correct line numbers but apparently sometimes I get messed up so it says here on some line but that's because the source generation messed up and section different line so yeah the only option that I know is really just look on a the similarly related line and hopefully you should find the the issue any advice for Iranian beginner Game Dev uh the advice is the same as for anyone else so really if you want to learn then kitchen chaos course really awesome one so if you are a beginner start that one maybe watch my uh cop course if you want that so yeah those two are really awesome beginner things just depends do you want to make a game or do you want to focus on the language itself both are really great starting point yeah R my $15 keyboard for years now yeah the previous keyboard the one that I had before this one I had it for like I want to say like 15 years something like that cuz I remember that I had that keyboard as a kid and it only died like two years ago a year ago so yeah and it was not an expensive keyboard so yeah I'm guessing I paid for it some like 15 bucks 20 bucks and it's somehow that keyboard survived for literally 15 20 years so yeah it's quite amazing how some things just seem to last quite a lot so yeah it's a nice one part two not course be ready soon I'm currently actively working on it so the answer is yes soon as to when soon I'm not sure perhaps on this week something like that so yeah I'm currently researching writing testing it validating and so on but yeah so around this hopefully should be something like that should be a nice one do you have many Portuguese people in the channel I'm curious how many Portuguese DS are making games I think that would be interesting to see that is a good question I think the answer is like 3% let me look at my analytics uh like audience or geographies uh try moving this one look at that so this for the in last 30 days so us up top with 70k then India Kingdom Turkey Germany Russia and looking at Portugal I'm guessing it's there you go down here so I guess 0.6% so it's a bit less than I thought but still 3,000 people that's quite a lot of people so yeah that's uh uh pretty nice so yeah definitely the uh but it's a nice mix I like that so it's not like there are some channels that are like 90% us I like how this one is quite a bit dogs are getting hungry yeah he's walking around everywhere uh so I like it's a nice mix so us India UK turkey Germany yeah really nice mix of countries and you have Portugal over here on 0.6 yeah pretty fun pretty nice uh right there something a bit of fun so no man's Skai loading system debug so a fun video showing a debug camera moving super fast no man's Skai where you can clearly see their loading system in action and importantly see how fast it is so here is the video so uh someone with loading time smoking mirrors and how in reality this one doesn't actually have that much smoking mirrors like it just moves a camera super fast it is super fast just loading all the all the things there's all those flashes which I think it's actually loading something and you can see how the terrain streams how the level of detail how the trees start coming in so yeah but it's quite insane how in 20 seconds you can go from one one world which is all loaded into memory somehow unload all of that load a completely different world with a complet different biome and somehow do all of that super fast and the whole thing running on a PS5 right here it's definitely quite quite insane the loading system they built for this so yeah it's quite an amazing thing I mean if you try doing this by default you are going to encounter a lot of issues so this is definitely a very amazing thing so very impressive yeah on these don't care much about cutting patterns clean code just trying to make the thing instead of trying to understand how the thing have to be made they will make the Indie dream I mean technically when it comes to code quality technically you can't build anything with bad quality code but but if you write bad quality code the chances of you ever reaching the end of that project are much much smaller as opposed to if you write proper code if you write dirty code you can always build something tiny that's that's not going to be an issue but if you make anything relatively complex like if you were to make no man's Sky if you were to make that without any concern for code quality you would never finish this game you would get to a point where you just get drowned in a ton of complexity you would never reach the end you would get to a point where you can't just add more mechanics you can't just add more things because anytime you add one thing you've got to modify a billion different files and you just get all completely messed up so yeah technically you can make anything work with bad code but the more complex it is the more that becomes a really difficult task so yeah you don't care about clean code and patterns until you experience your own foot gun injury so yeah that has definitely happened to me quite a while I did spend quite a long time not really worrying too much about quality of my code just okay if it works it works and eventually what I was saying was actually happening to me as I was trying to make more and more complex games I was figuring out that at the end of development things were becoming much much more difficult uh to develop like I remember making Survivor squads I remember in the end trying to make the boss fights and all those things how it was such a mess so difficult to do all this AI like if I had a proper code base I could have made all of these uh all these complex systems interactions that would have been much much easier to to make if the code base was actually solid but the whole thing was quite a mess although it wasn't as much a mess as when I tried cuz by the time that I made this game I already had like uh six years of experience making games so yeah I already had a little bit but still the code was definitely not I was definitely not super focused on code quality and that did definitely like Ben said yeah you definitely get your own foot injury you're going to shoot yourself in the foot so yeah I definitely did experience that and since then I definitely gained more and more of an appreciation for how to write good clean code and if you do that that is the only way you can make complex games like I could not have made dinky Guardians if I was not crap I could not have made this game without focusing on code quality this is a very complex game tons of systems all of them interlocking all of them talking to one another I could not have made this game without concern without thinking about code quality if I was Runing dirty code this game would simply never be finished so yep that is why nowadays I'm constantly talking about clean code it's because I did experience what it's like to not worry about it and I did experience these sufferings I did shoot myself in the foot many times so yep that is why nowadays I'm very much like that RTS build space and surface combat yeah I mean making oh is this one playing sound oh crap I hope that doesn't mess up the stream uh so if you want to make a giant game some like total Annihilation an RTS like that you definitely do need to consider loading quite a bit because it is going to be uh quite a challenge just ignore me too that works sorry I'm trying to keep up with all the comments live stream after to use I'm using OBS actually right here on the side there you go look at that Inception uh yeah OBS really awesome free software it's quite it's quite amazing how this is free it's like definitely quite an insane thing such an awesome software so useful so used by so many people and yet it is complet free so yep definitely a big fan of OBS uh it does pretty much everything all the time uh so yeah this really fun video in a few seconds you can easily load and unload multiple completely different planets along with all the levels of detail in all the objects and if you pay close attention you can naturally see some popping so loading is fast but not instant and the grass rain detail of that rendering showing up but in normal gameplay it just looks beautifully perfectly smooth so yeah if you really pay attention frame by frame you can see terrain popping out look at those objects disappearing the terrain slowly fading away look that a different level of detail for the terrain mask that one showing up and as it zooms in yep you can see it starts to show the clouds then shs to show some terrain then terrain merging into another terrain then different level of detail then start showing all the particles and so on so yeah so if you look at it you can see things streaming in and out of existence but yeah in normal gameplay you really don't see it just because it is so insanely fast and looks really awesome look at that going to another different one loading all the things and Yep looks perfect insanely fast insanely performant that is definitely quite an amazing one so yeah always learn I was love learning about tricks for how developers had loading 20 years ago it was all about long elevator r yeah it's kind of funny how this is kind of thing how I can write this over here and I wonder how many people know what I'm referring to because nowadays yeah for a few years now well I guess I guess the god of war game which came out in 2018 did have some tight spaces to hide the loading so that probably hasn't necessarily fully uh vanished but yeah I do wonder how many people remember long elevator rides because yeah those used to be all the way back in the early 2000 because it did take some time to load a complete different level so yeah the best way is really just making a long elit ride add some dialogue and you can easily unload something load something else and looks really awesome but yeah nowadays we just need a tiny bit of smoke and perhaps one day things might be so fast we might not need to hide any loading at all so yeah chat sharp that's a that's a funny name yep portal to always those elevators really nice really cool yeah how do you come up with a game name that is a very tricky question because yeah coming up with a good game name is indeed quite a tricky thing uh so yeah that is one thing that you definitely have to Workshop it look at uh similar game uh look at games similar to yours to get some ideas maybe ask AI to brainstorm a bunch of uh game name ideas so yeah basically anything can work as a game but some things like for example change together that is a great name it's a very clear uh name it very clearly describes what the game is all about and it wasn't taken so yeah just by itself a really great game her truck simulator I like uh really descriptive names so seven days die that is fun but yeah if you try going for something super complex super unique like fields of mystera I don't know what that is but apparently it does have a th000 reviews so apparently it is a positive one but yeah if you try going for hey Min solers that was fun looks like that factory game with thing nice just 27 reviews oh interesting looks nice uh so yeah coming up with a name is always an interesting challenge it's always uh it's always a fun one yeah the name should generally describe the core concept or the idea yep especially for in developers if you try going too unique that is going to be tricky so usually for in developers going a bit more generic a bit more X simulator that is usually a better way as opposed to coming up with a really unique name that nobody's going to know how to pronounce so yep about to learn how to create a 2d turn based strategy is Unity good way to go yep sure I mean pretty much any engine nowadays is great for making any game so unity and Realo all of those are capable of making uh 2D turnbas strategy game so yep personally I love unity but yep use whatever and all of those are really good to work for making that kind of game yeah do a copy of Gun Mayhem implementing enemies that shoot and move through the platforms is doable and how much time without experience I'm not sure what is Gun Mayhem interesting shooting game is it an iio game okay so like a sid scrolling shoot them up game okay but is it multiplayer or with AI enemies making this in single player relatively easy making it multiplayer a bit more complex uh but implementing AI that shoot and move through the platforms is doable in how much time without experience I mean if you literally mean no experience then it is going to be a bit of a challenge uh because you do need to learn quite a lot of things uh so yeah how much time I don't know 3 months it really depends on what you mean by without experience it is not based on the screenshots cuz I I'm not familiar with the game but a s scrolling shoot them up it is is not necessarily super complex but if you have zero experience then even making something like flightboard is going to be relatively complex so yeah maybe a few months but yeah definitely a a by looking at the screenshots definitely a doable project so yeah sounds like a a fun nice uh start project yeah P physics is Stu any ideas for how to do that mechanic for Port the big issue is not necessarily the physics that part should actually not be too difficult so you just have to see okay when this Cube or this sphere goes inside the portal just spawn it on the other place and apply the correct opposing physics the issue with uh making a portal game the bigger issue is with rendering like you have a portal and you have to render like half a cube over here and then on the other portal you have to run the other half of the cube so that is really tricky yeah Sebastian lag pretty sure he does have a video on that so yeah if you're if you're going that approach portal here pretty sure I remember seeing yeah this one yeah that's exactly it so yeah handling the visuals that is a really tricky thing because you have to render essentially two objects so yeah that part becomes really tricky very very complex very quickly yeah being able to move between the portals and being able to see the correct perspective from the correct angles then being able to move an object from here to there and so so yeah portal is one of those things that sounds relatively simple in theory it's really just a hole connect to another hole but in reality it's a lot more complex so yeah it's definitely one of those deceptively simple looking games that is actually very complex which by itself means that it is a great uh game mechanic to work as a sord challenge look at that that's fun nice take a look at ninja remix on Steam and suggest some Chang as we do let's see Ninja remix okay the particles look nice they look interesting the levels seem a bit oh Master unique Jus oh that that sounds like a a fun concept build your Clan with diverse ninjas and dive into multiplayer PVP battles or progress through the story all set to a cool Funk beat I have no idea what is a funk beat but I don't have a right now so I'm hoping it sounds nice uh but yeah I like the particles the particles do look really cool and the hand signs those also look really cool nice yeah basically how to make a Naruto game without Naruto IP uh so yeah I mean without sound just looking at the trailer it does seem nice I would only say that the visuals over here seem a bit too basic like this area seems way too empty so like I really like the particles but it's seems like the area is may be way too basic but the particles look good so maybe that can actually and I do like that one about the player being pushed upwards I think it makes it very clear what the game is about so in terms of mechanics I actually think it's really awesome I think maybe the visuals just need a little bit of a Polish over here but but I don't know that's just a minor nitpick so in general just looking at the visuals it does uh seem pretty nice and the particles and the screenshots uh I guess you could maybe have a little bit of variety cuz like these three screenshots all look pretty much exactly the same so there's a character doing something on top of grass so I guess I guess I would spend some time building some different biomes yeah the grass looks too even yeah it looks like this has literally the same height at all points so maybe that is why it looks so basic because yeah because the grass all looks just one uniform thing as opposed to having I don't know some flowers here and there something like that so yeah I would build a different biome one on like Desert Snow something like that yeah having some hills or different height and yeah this screenshot is a bit strange I'm guessing it's showing this character but yeah um remix I really like this image that is nice for game more strategy creativity and bit of nonchalance can make you a legend stepping into ninja remix build your Clan mess your Jus and claim your place at the top this is single player and PVP nice make hand sign called jutus that sounds nice yeah I do like the idea of mixing hand signs like one of my favorite games growing up was Magicka so the idea of Magicka plus ninjas I'm already interested in it so yeah that sounds nice creat your clan that's a nice screenshot that is cool me could be animated but just by itself looks pretty cool and G oh look at that you've got an interesting uh little biome over here why don't you have one of those screenshots kind of like this biome being standing on rocks like this reminds of like a DBZ screenshot something like that so that could be cool man ninika that would be nice yeah uh Community Driven epic yeah that sounds uh nice so hly in general I do think it is pretty good I do think the the uh capsule image definitely does require something uh I would say this definitely looks way too basic so I would hire an artist something like that to make a proper capsule because the capsule does mean quite a lot it matters a ton and this capsule does look extremely basic like like essentially this looks like something that I would do me with zero art skills that's basically what I would do just pick up uh an image of the character pick up the Logo put some blurry thing on the background I would do so that's what I would do but I'm not an artist so that that means not necessarily very good so I'll definitely hire a proper artist to make a proper capsule and yeah in terms of the uh description over here sounds nice sounds cool uh me personally as someone who likes ninjas Naruto yeah that is cool so yeah then I would modify a few of those things but in general pretty nice yeah now let me see cdb doino let me see Ninja remix so this one has 12 followers so about 100 wish list so yeah definitely do those changes and then start doing some marketing start posting some gifts on Twitter uh something like that cuz I do think the cream D jutus that is an interesting one so if you come up with an interesting title and make an interesting uh gift showing a bunch of images like a mini fight and someone I do think that could do well on Twitter Reddit maybe even on Tik Tok and something like that so yeah that could be that's what I would try to try to get a bit more visibility wish list and so on but yeah so far it looks really cool so yeah uh congrats on that yeah nice hit Subs but a lot of users want for mobile yeah yeah for this kind of game yeah it's uh yeah I guess some of those W one for PC so yeah it's always it's always tricky to get that like I'm making a PC game but people are ask for mobile but it's not really possible and so on so yeah but yeah I would say you're on the uh right path so yeah definitely do keep going cuz yeah that looks quite nice look at Castle yards step into the role of medieval Lord in Castle yard a captivating Castle Management game where your strategic decisions shape the fate of your realm manage resources train Knights and navigate the intricate politics of your court to lead your people to Prosperity okay that sounds like an interesting uh thing although it seems like the trailer is way too slow so in like 25 seconds we've seen just basally two images so isn't like a text Adventure sort of thing that does make it a bit hard to make a more compelling uh trailer so you got a bunch of resources then you go out side so you manage a bunch of things okay we got a nice jousting mini game that's fun nice but yeah the beginning is definitely way too slow again I'm I don't have sound so I don't know like I don't have headphones right now so I can hear but yeah does seem like so it takes like 10 seconds there you go 10 11 12 13 14 so almost 20 seconds before we see something a little bit different like in the beginning yeah it does look like a visual novel which I guess but is it cuz on this uh description I see it more as like a Castle Management game so like uh I don't know Kingdom kingdoms and castles so I'm imagining something top down managing a castle building things and so on whereas yeah the trailer definitely gives the vibe of being much more of a visual novel so so I would say definitely trailer seems a bit too a bit too slow for the screenshots sure they all look nice they have nice variety I would just say the over here this one seems a bit too basic so I would maybe add some icons over here for each of these so come up with an icon so it's not just text on a Col background have some kind of icon to make it a little bit more interesting so I would probably do that to make this pop out a little bit more uh for the font looks nice and the background art that does look nice and yeah icons help with localization too yeah that's also a very good tip very nice how will you roll the font is a little bit hard to read but it does match with the theme so I don't think that's necessarily uh B thing s r of medieval Lord and Castle yard an immersive RPG management game where you strategic decisions shape the fate of your castle and realm man resources train Knights and navigate the intricate politics of your court to lead your people to Prosperity yeah that's uh that is a uh nice one your choice matter you've got indepth management and exciting tournaments so got nice little J boom there goes little uh Shield um so yeah although over here I would say you need to add some kind of bone letters some kind of uh okay you got Bonet points but I definitely add some bone letters over here at some point just because the text is too too bland basically just being like this just being normal text I'll definitely put some things like the cleard in bold or adjusting tournaments in bold something like that so I would add a little bit of uh different hey prer games hey how's it going uh so I definitely add that to make a little bit more different uh but yeah the images the gifts I do like those so yeah and the the thing over here I think maybe the text is a bit too small I do like how it is like really under the castle and he couldn't really increase the size of the castle without hiding the rest of this so I do think the background image is nice although the text does seem a bit hard to read a bit too tiny so very beautiful image but yeah definitely having uh being a little bit hard to so maybe I would experiment with that maybe experiment with some Shadows some thickness something like that but in general the image behind it is definitely definitely awesome so it could be a bit larger if you move it a little bit down here yeah maybe little bit like that uh could be an interesting one miss our important Saturday stream was on vacation yeah that's cool I I hope you enjoyed your vacation nice yeah yeah the definitely best of luck with uh the game Gary spell weer it or this one I guess in terms of visuals it does seem quite nice point and click puzzle game oh I got to say I'm not good with I'm not good at point point and clicks uh start with six based elements and combine them together oh so it's kind of like that crafting game something like that oh is this I don't know if this is messes up the stream or not so let me just put that if I put it in full screen I think it's going to mess up a bunch of things new game Heather buttons to spawn elements coning elements cost points drag and drop elements to combine them lock new elements on recycling bin or trash to clear them trash Lo point recycles funds most of them try unlock so right away my advice would be okay this seems like way too much text so I would definitely split this into parts and I would be like okay when I interact with this part teach me what this does then after a while teach me what this does then after a while teach me what this does instead of uh a prewall of text I would say uh yeah show don't tell definitely uh spawn them okay so if I and is the tool tip meant to be that big I'm guessing this this is some kind of issue possibly an issue with being in full screen or not or maybe I guess just the thing like that um oh you just click on it and then you mix them together where are their spiders am I supposed to kill the spiders I pick up their blood we got some water some water and crystals makes a sapphire apparently and burn Sapphire what does it do doesn't do anything so burn some dark thing and create smoke then smoke in air does do something nope doesn't do anything uh oh wasn't I supposed to see smoke up here uh so Dark Crystal with a spider can I merge with the spider no I can't okay the spider is eating my stuff let's make it dark Crystal amethyst that's nice amethyst and Earth does it do anything nope doesn't do anything yeah I supposed to get a bunch of things added up there uh we've got Earth and light makes the crystals light and Fire doesn't do anything oh it does a ruby nice there you go why why do some of them get out of the pier and some don't I'm not sure I understand that one and what are the the uh I guess they give you spell points something like that so I made clouds can I make rain clouds yeah I can make rain and what do they do do with rain going to Earth nope can't do anything with Earth and rain so about Earth and light does that give me nope I want to make like plants or something so let me burn some Mak lava okay that's fun and lava plus air doesn't do anything okay so let me make a cloud of lava nope so take lava and let's burn a ruby nope what can I do with lava let's burn something nope lav in more fire I guess yeah doesn't do anything okay some more Earth on lava nope we got rain oh how about if I take lava and add some water okay got some clouds rain and Ruby nope okay some dark dark fire that already try that okay make Smoke Smoke and Things nope yeah cuz some of them recycle the entire board oh it just takes out all of those gives me some kind of thing I can destroy elements I can see hints Earth with Crystal oh that's nice I do like having a nice hint system so I can make an emerald dark with lava didn't I try that and didn't work oh obsidian nice can I mix two gems no catalog so all the recipes W 16 out of 400 uh oh it's scrolling up and down so this would be nice to have some kind of uh bar just to be able to see okay have I scroll down enough am I not okay not sure but yeah I do like the the uh the uh hint system just because I always suck so let me try putting fire and water makes alcohol really Fire and Water okay I guess uh an Earth with dark what is that going to do it's going to make some Stones nice only had two weeks of making yeah I mean this is really awesome for for two weeks or even more than two weeks uh it does does have quite a lot of content I mean with 400 recipes I'm guessing you'd def find all of these things using scripal objects and all the recipes using scripal objects so it's really one of those games that is very content heavy trying to do quite a lot of things fire water yeah uh so yeah I'm guessing this one of those games that the mechanics themselves I'm guessing you probably made those relatively quickly but then trying to work quite a lot at building all the recipes all the possible combinations make them in a way that makes sense makes interesting but yeah it's definitely definitely a a fun interesting game so yeah congrats on building this for the for the uh uh game Jam did this get like uh submission page so did it finish already I don't know the uh so like does it have a score yeah a bunch of people really liked it extremely well made for game Jam yeah really awesome yeah that is definitely judging is still going on oh okay nice all right but yeah definitely looks like a good one I have no idea what the what the theme was what was the theme the uh theme shadows and anemy okay so yeah definitely does make sense so it does indeed match up with the theme so yeah nice yeah yeah I I hope the voting does well it's cool find recipes in Google Sheets and Export to Json then automated script objects using ASD Creator now that is awesome that is a really cool uh usage of uh external tools and then building your own tools to help you develop your game that is definitely really awesome so yeah yeah congrats it does look like a really nice game especially for being built in two weeks that is definitely really cool so yeah congrats on the game really nice um okay so yeah song rating oh wow it's almost seven oh I didn't know it was so late so yeah my dogs are walking around as you can probably hear so yeah uh going to go and do something and so on by the way for those of you who are channel members I do the oh um uh I got the oh that's what I didn't even know what I was looking for but yeah for those who are channel members I do have the the uh live streams every Saturday so I'll be doing that tomorrow so if you do then check the uh members Discord and you'll find the link for the live stream for tomorrow so yeah basically I've been doing those consistently and I do hope to be able to do some more uh of these public live streams uh in the future uh so yeah should be fun should be interesting and yeah if you're interested in seeing up to date definitely check out the Game Dev report I should put uh publish another one on Sunday I've been pushing that out so yeah if you want to read the news definitely look into that sign up and yeah it's a fun way to stay up to dat start new Project Unity and found the fastest version is 2019.4 wow really that is pretty old I would say 2019.4 isn't even efficiently supported so I would definitely use something a bit later but yeah I mean I guess if that one is the fastest version I guess depends on what you're doing I would not release a game on that version just because it seems like it's way too old that's like 5 years old now so that might have issues with compatibility but you could definitely build the entire game like that and then one month before release then upgrade to the LTS version and be pretty nice so yeah roughly that's what I would do okay um oh there's some all right okay so oh yeah and if you want speed then using the hot reload asset that can definitely help out quite a little bit uh okay so let me put this like that and so on and it should be fun let me pop this back how do I pop this back there you go like that uh all right so yeah thank you all for being here and I hope you have a great rest of your day weekend and if you remember then I will see you all tomorrow all right so yeah have a great rest of your day and I'll see you next time all right bye everyone for
