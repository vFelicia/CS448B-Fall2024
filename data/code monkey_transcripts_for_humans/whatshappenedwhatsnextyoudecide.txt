00:00 - hey everyone here's a quick update video
00:02 - with everything that's happened
00:03 - what's coming up in the future so first
00:05 - of all just recently the channel
00:06 - surpassed 200 000 subscribers
00:09 - that's an insane amount that's really
00:10 - awesome so i'd like to begin by thank
00:12 - you all for your support
00:13 - these videos really only exist because
00:15 - you watch them so thank you for that and
00:17 - i hope i can continue producing videos
00:19 - that you enjoy watching and learning
00:20 - from
00:21 - as you know i've just launched the
00:22 - complete visual scripting course this
00:24 - was a ton of work and kept me super busy
00:26 - for several weeks
00:27 - so because of that i really didn't
00:28 - manage to have the time to do anything
00:30 - special to commemorate the two hundred
00:31 - thousand
00:32 - then before that i was super busy
00:34 - working on the building defender course
00:36 - and before that i was working for months
00:38 - on the code monkey steam app
00:40 - so i spent the greater portion of this
00:41 - year focused on making some massive
00:43 - projects
00:44 - and i'm really happy with how they came
00:45 - out but in doing so it kind of limited
00:47 - what i could do with the normal videos
00:49 - over here on the channel
00:50 - so my goal now at least until january is
00:52 - to focus only on making interesting and
00:54 - awesome videos
00:55 - my main thing with this particular video
00:57 - is to ask you what type of content would
00:58 - you like to see
00:59 - this channel really only works if i make
01:01 - the kind of videos that you want to see
01:03 - so i need your feedback
01:04 - there's tons and tons of interesting
01:06 - topics i'd love to explore
01:07 - for example i would like to experiment
01:09 - with some live streams i think that
01:11 - could be interesting for some more
01:12 - real-time interaction and real-time
01:14 - learning
01:14 - then i haven't touched dots in ages so
01:17 - that's something i'd really like to
01:18 - revisit
01:19 - i'm guessing the dots multiplayer
01:20 - package has also evolved quite a bit so
01:22 - i'd like to look into that one
01:24 - i'd also like to make some more gamedev
01:26 - reacts videos those are always
01:28 - interesting to make and provide a
01:29 - different look into popular games
01:31 - another topic i'd love to explore is
01:33 - machine learning unity has some great
01:35 - tools for it and it has enormous
01:37 - potential to help small devs make some
01:39 - very interesting games
01:40 - there was also the idea of making some
01:42 - asset review videos so this could be a
01:44 - great home since there's tons of
01:45 - extremely useful packages
01:47 - then there's also vr which unity has
01:49 - excellent tools for it so i'd like to
01:51 - look into that one
01:52 - and the same thing for ar which again
01:54 - unity also has some awesome tools so
01:56 - that could be something interesting
01:58 - so from all that what is the type of
01:59 - content that you'd like to see are you
02:01 - interested in any of these topics
02:03 - or maybe you'd like to see some more
02:04 - complete games like i did for the top
02:06 - down shooter and wash your hands
02:08 - game or maybe just some normal tutorials
02:11 - if so let me know on what topic i've
02:13 - already done tons of tutorials but
02:14 - there's still some genres i haven't
02:15 - covered yet
02:16 - for example i was watching initial d a
02:18 - couple of weeks ago and it reminded me
02:20 - that i've never done any racing videos
02:22 - so like i said there's tons of topics
02:24 - i'm interested in that would make for
02:25 - some great content for you to watch and
02:27 - learn from
02:28 - but i need your help to decide what to
02:30 - prioritize so let me know in the
02:31 - comments
02:32 - by the way next week there's the mixing
02:34 - game jam happening i haven't done a game
02:36 - jam in ages so i'm thinking of
02:38 - participating
02:39 - this one is managed by andre from mixing
02:41 - jam so it's bound to be very interesting
02:43 - also if you did pick up the courses
