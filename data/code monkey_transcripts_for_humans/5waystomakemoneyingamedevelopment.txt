00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code among
00:01 - him in this video I'm going to give you
00:02 - five ways to make money and game dev
00:04 - let's begin
00:08 - number one work at a game studio this is
00:11 - the most straightforward option you just
00:14 - get a normal job at an already
00:15 - established studio if you're just
00:17 - starting out it's probably the best and
00:18 - least risky option you will be working
00:21 - with people who are much more
00:22 - experienced than you and more than a lot
00:24 - from them so if you're interested in
00:26 - learning and becoming a better game dev
00:28 - you will improve a lot faster when
00:29 - surround by experienced people then if
00:31 - we try to learn it all by yourself if
00:34 - you get a job at a big triple-a studio
00:35 - you will be able to see a tiny bit of
00:37 - your work being sold in a box copy this
00:39 - can be a great feeling and having some
00:41 - real tangible proof that you have
00:42 - reached your dream of becoming a game
00:44 - developer the pros are hopefully you
00:46 - won't find a job in a good studio which
00:48 - will give you stability in terms of
00:50 - hours and income so you don't constantly
00:52 - you have to worry about how you won't
00:54 - get income this month as long as you're
00:56 - working you won't get paid the cons
00:58 - however are you don't get to work on
01:00 - exactly what you want working in a large
01:02 - studio means working on someone else's
01:04 - idea so if you're a huge fan of
01:06 - management games or pointing clicks you
01:08 - won't really be working on those types
01:10 - of games in a large studio so hopefully
01:12 - you get a lot of stability at the cost
01:14 - of not having control number two
01:17 - freelance work being a freelancer in any
01:19 - industry is always an interesting and
01:21 - extremely challenging option it can be
01:24 - really interesting since you work on a
01:25 - multitude of different projects however
01:28 - it can also be extremely challenging to
01:30 - consistently find work and deal with all
01:32 - the bureaucracy of being self-employed
01:33 - there might be months where in letting
01:35 - the great contract and get paid a nice
01:37 - amount for some really interesting work
01:39 - in some other months where he can't find
01:41 - anything and as a result you don't get
01:43 - paid at all being a freelancer is also
01:45 - very much dependent on your skill set if
01:48 - you're an artist there is a lot of
01:49 - places where you can put up your
01:50 - portfolio and try to contact for example
01:53 - some of any types but there are
01:55 - thousands upon thousands of artists
01:56 - looking for work so it's very tough to
01:58 - get paid a nice amount it is a job with
02:01 - a lot of supply compared to the demand
02:03 - and if you're a programmer unityconnect
02:05 - always has a bunch of interesting jobs
02:07 - and since code is code you can do
02:09 - freelance programming in any area if you
02:12 - know code it doesn't have to be just
02:13 - limited to game dev which increases the
02:15 - amount of offers you have available
02:17 - essentially when it comes to being a
02:19 - freelancer the main difficulty is
02:20 - finding work so having a nice list of
02:22 - recurring contacts makes it that much
02:24 - easier
02:25 - so in here it is more risky and less
02:27 - stable than working at a game studio but
02:28 - you do get to work on interesting
02:30 - projects and you have full control over
02:32 - what projects you take number three make
02:35 - an indie game this is the one everyone
02:37 - wants but also the one with the most
02:39 - risk it's great to be able to work on
02:41 - your own game ideas and create exactly
02:43 - the kind of game you want to create you
02:45 - are completely free to create anything
02:47 - you want you decide on what genre you
02:49 - want to make what weapons you create how
02:50 - the story goes and so on
02:52 - you have complete creative freedom
02:54 - however in choosing this path it also
02:57 - means that everything is on you if you
02:59 - work on a game for two years and it
03:01 - sounds 0 copies you will get zero income
03:04 - for all of that work so unless you have
03:06 - a ton of savings to burn through this
03:08 - can end up in a disaster poly can
03:11 - absolutely make any game you want you
03:13 - also need to make sure there is a market
03:14 - for it in the end
03:15 - this is a hyper-competitive business and
03:18 - when where 90% of games actually fail
03:20 - there are tons of games coming out every
03:22 - month and you have to stand out from all
03:24 - of them to be able to have a chance just
03:27 - go browse this team new releases list
03:29 - and see how many games fail to get just
03:31 - even 10 reviews but I don't want to
03:33 - completely discourage you I want to
03:35 - encourage you to make your own games but
03:37 - be aware of what it takes and what the
03:39 - chances are you won't make a profit this
03:41 - path can be extremely satisfying but it
03:44 - does come with a very large risk so if
03:46 - you're just starting out I would suggest
03:48 - you grow your skills and try to make
03:50 - your own games on the side once having a
03:52 - stable job this way you won't go
03:54 - homeless if the game fails but you'll
03:56 - still gain experience and the more
03:58 - experience you have the better your
03:59 - games will be and you will eventually be
04:01 - able to make it and go full-time so if
04:04 - you do follow this path keep that in
04:06 - mind it is very risky and you might not
04:08 - make it but also very fulfilling when
04:10 - you do make it so figure out a way to
04:12 - minimize risk as much as possible and
04:14 - to it number for some assets there are
04:18 - several stores where you can sell assets
04:19 - directly to other developers if you're
04:22 - an artist you can sell your 3d models or
04:24 - textures it can also sound sounds and
04:27 - various scripts for things like camera
04:29 - control animations or shaders for
04:31 - example on the Unity assets or you can
04:33 - browse it to look at everything being
04:35 - offered and also while selling assets
04:37 - you may come across people looking for
04:39 - freelance work so if you're an artist
04:42 - and you make some great art you might be
04:44 - contacted for someone looking for that
04:45 - specific style unity promotes their
04:48 - assets or heavenly so if you do manage
04:50 - to make something good enough and useful
04:52 - for a lot of people you can find quite a
04:54 - lot of success however there are also a
04:56 - lot of websites offering free assets so
04:59 - whatever you try to sell you need to
05:01 - make sure it is actually worth the
05:02 - asking price and similar to making an
05:05 - indie game once you can create literally
05:08 - anything you want you do have to make
05:09 - sure that there's a market for it
05:11 - otherwise you won't get paid
05:13 - number five teach inside this option you
05:17 - have several different options each of
05:19 - these is obviously dependent on already
05:21 - having good knowledge of game
05:23 - development you can really teach people
05:25 - if you're just starting out first you
05:27 - need to gather your own knowledge and
05:29 - then you can try to teach people so you
05:31 - could get a job as a professor in a
05:33 - school with a game that of course
05:34 - nowadays there are more and more schools
05:36 - offering courses related to game
05:38 - development you could also create and
05:40 - someone complete premium courses this is
05:43 - a relatively crowd market and something
05:45 - I personally wouldn't like to explore in
05:47 - the future there are plenty of websites
05:48 - to jambe some courses and there's always
05:50 - a lot of people interested in learning
05:51 - game development the games industry is
05:54 - constantly growing so the more it grows
05:56 - the more there is a need for game
05:58 - developers so you can rest assured that
06:00 - there will always be people looking to
06:02 - learn or you can also do what I'm doing
06:05 - here make free videos covering all
06:07 - aspects of game development however I'm
06:09 - currently
06:10 - making any money on this channel so I
06:12 - wouldn't consider this event alternative
06:13 - just by itself making videos and
06:16 - especially on YouTube is an extremely
06:18 - difficult path once again there's a lot
06:20 - of supply relative to the demand in
06:22 - order to make an income you need
06:24 - hundreds of thousands of subs and views
06:25 - which are quite difficult to get the
06:28 - only way I can afford to work on this
06:29 - channel is as a side job to my indie
06:31 - games hopefully one day this channel
06:34 - will grow enough to start to pay for
06:35 - itself
06:36 - but until then it remains a side job so
06:39 - there you have it five ways to make
06:41 - money whilst working in game development
06:42 - they range from very stable to very
06:45 - risky it's up to you to decide what you
06:47 - value most creativity or stability if
06:50 - you have any questions post them in the
06:51 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
06:53 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
06:54 - see you next time
