01:37 - feature that i wish unity had by default
01:39 - just some way of organizing the
01:40 - hierarchy you can add some groups and
01:42 - some colors and this is definitely a
01:44 - great way to very quickly and easily

01:48 - your hierarchy then for an interesting
01:50 - free demo here's a tool for building
01:52 - roads and traffic it's all procedural so

02:38 - renderer from one bone structure to
02:40 - another one if you saw my video on
02:42 - character customization i talked about
02:44 - how this is quite a tricky process it
02:46 - needs to be done very carefully or it
02:48 - just won't work so this tool seems
02:50 - excellent for doing all those steps
02:52 - correctly although not sure if it works
02:53 - on non-blank assets but since it's free
02:55 - you can just give it a try then if you
02:57 - want some nice camera post pressing
02:59 - effects here's a free sample i think
03:01 - this free sample only includes the cctv
03:04 - camera effect but if you don't like it
03:05 - then the whole pack has tons more
03:06 - effects i also covered how to do
03:08 - something like this in another video if
03:10 - you want to try building it yourself and
03:12 - then here's a simple pack just a bunch
03:14 - of 3d power-ups if your game involves
03:16 - power-ups and you want some quick simple
03:18 - ones to prototype then you can just pick
03:19 - this up features 10 generic symbols
