04:25 - almost no impact on performance
04:27 - works on all types of grids both in 2d
04:29 - and 3d support

04:56 - this pack it might seem familiar since i
04:58 - use this to make the racing rts
05:00 - and also the checkpoint system and also
05:02 - the upcoming machine learning car driver
05:04 - if you need some cars then this is a
05:06 - great pack includes 32 vehicles with
05:08 - racing cars rally cars and monster
