00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your cmy so after
00:02 - 5 years and 800 videos the channel has
00:04 - now reached 500,000 subscribers honestly
00:07 - that's an insane amount there's no way
00:09 - my brain can visualize 500,000 people
00:10 - clicking on that button so I really just
00:12 - want to thank you all so much I truly
00:15 - hope that my videos have helped you on
00:16 - your Game Dev Journey honestly back in
00:18 - 2018 when I started this channel I
00:19 - really had no idea what to expect I just
00:22 - wanted to make some fun tutorial videos
00:23 - basically just sharing the knowledge
00:24 - that I had acquired in making my own
00:26 - games by 2018 I already had 5 years of
00:28 - experience making these flash games and
00:30 - I also had 5 years working with unity so
00:32 - I felt that I had a pretty nice amount
00:34 - of knowledge that I could share with
00:35 - people to help them get started
00:37 - personally I've always enjoyed making my
00:38 - own games but one quote unquote downside
00:41 - is that I would work on just a single
00:42 - project for an entire year even though
00:45 - I've always been very curious and want
00:46 - to explore tons of areas so I truly hope
00:48 - that my videos have been very helpful to
00:50 - you but also just for me personally
00:52 - building this channel has been very
00:53 - Mally gratifying basically this allows
00:55 - me to research all sorts of unique and
00:57 - interesting projects things like for
00:59 - example exploring multiplayer or
01:01 - learning how to make an interesting
01:02 - Tetris inventory system learning how to
01:05 - draw a nice mesh making a weapon
01:07 - attachment system making a racing miname
01:10 - or working with machine learning making
01:12 - a house building system playing around
01:14 - with some interesting cloud-based
01:15 - mechanics researching Unity dots
01:18 - researching ASR pathfinding how to do
01:20 - some animation briging or making a
01:22 - unique crafting system these are all
01:24 - things that have been very satisfying
01:26 - for me personally to learn and hopefully
01:28 - also very useful to you as well I
01:30 - probably would have not explored all of
01:31 - these unique areas if it was just by
01:33 - myself making games now if you want one
01:35 - tip for how to actually learn something
01:37 - the best tip I can give you is learn it
01:39 - and then try to teach it to someone
01:41 - doing that means you truly need to
01:42 - understand the topic in order to be able
01:43 - to teach someone and for myself making
01:46 - all of these 800 videos has massively
01:48 - helped supercharge my own learning and
01:49 - of course the reason why I can't keep
01:51 - doing all this is because of all of you
01:53 - this channel is very much a two-way
01:54 - street without you here this channel
01:56 - would not exist so really thank you so
01:58 - much for being here thank you for Subs
01:59 - subscribing and watching the videos I
02:01 - truly hope the videos have helped you on
02:02 - your game dep Journey then on top of the
02:04 - 500k which was already a huge
02:05 - achievement on top of that last week was
02:08 - unity's United Conference where they
02:09 - announc the winners for their Unity
02:10 - Awards these awards are wrote down by
02:13 - the community so because of that I value
02:15 - them quite a lot and a lot of you voted
02:17 - for me so I end up winning three Awards
02:19 - I was hoping to win the best Eternal
02:21 - award that's my main focus and earlier
02:23 - this year I made my free complete course
02:25 - which Took a ton of work but thankfully
02:26 - a lot of people really enjoyed it so I
02:28 - was hoping to win that award
02:29 - specifically for that course but I was
02:31 - definitely not expecting to win the
02:32 - other two all of you voted for dinky
02:34 - Guardians for best devlogs I'm really
02:36 - proud of that game and those devlogs I
02:38 - think that playlist is really great for
02:40 - showcasing the entire game that Journey
02:42 - from absolutely nothing to a published
02:44 - game with sales numbers on Steam but I
02:46 - did not expect to win simply because all
02:47 - the other nominees those are all equally
02:49 - excellent any one of these could have
02:51 - won I would have said yep that does make
02:53 - sense Jonas's devlogs are always very
02:55 - entertaining and Throne fall fall is a
02:56 - huge mega Indie hit then atre the dark
02:59 - Wild this one is a really visually
03:01 - unique automation game manav Val's
03:03 - devlogs are always very entertaining
03:05 - excellently edited so definitely go
03:07 - ahead and check out all of these if you
03:08 - enjoy watching Dev vogs and the other
03:10 - category that I won was best live
03:11 - streamer now I always try my best when I
03:13 - live stream I try very hard to engage
03:16 - with everyone while also trying to do
03:17 - some work I try to make the live streams
03:20 - entertaining and educational but I don't
03:22 - really do them very often so that is why
03:23 - I was not expecting this one if people
03:25 - voted then maybe that means that people
03:27 - would like them more so I really need to
03:28 - figure out some way to make them a more
03:30 - regular thing if you're looking for
03:32 - someone who streams pretty much every
03:33 - single day then check out L Lux on
03:35 - Twitch she's been working on her game
