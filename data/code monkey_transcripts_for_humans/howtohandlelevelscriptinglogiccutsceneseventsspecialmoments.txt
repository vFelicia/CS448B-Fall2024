00:01 - scripting basically all the things that
00:03 - you want to happen in a level in a
00:04 - script manner things like spawning some
00:06 - dialogue or triggering a cut scene once
00:08 - again you can Define some empty game
00:09 - objects to define the trigger positions
00:11 - and then the code you can check whenever
00:13 - a unit moves if a unit reaches that
00:15 - specific R position if so trigger a cut
00:17 - scene or spawn some enemies for this
00:19 - kind of level scripting you can
00:20 - literally just make a simple class that
00:22 - you attach maybe to the map prefab that
00:24 - class will contain all the logic for
00:26 - that map including all the map position
00:28 - references by doing it this way each pre
00:30 - Fab is essentially self-contained with
00:31 - the entire map as well as all the logic
00:33 - this is what I did in my turn-based
00:35 - strategy course for making the final
00:36 - level that level has some really
00:38 - interesting level scripting Logic for
00:39 - showing the rooms or waking up some
00:41 - enemies and all of that is handled Exel
00:43 - like this
