00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so last month i launched the complete
00:03 - visual scripting course which involves
00:05 - the making of two awesome games without
00:06 - writing any code
00:08 - and now for the past few weeks i've been
00:09 - working really hard on this one it's an
00:11 - fps which will be added as a completely
00:13 - free update to the course
00:15 - it's an interesting design with all the
00:17 - things that you would expect from an fps
00:19 - there's multiple weapons with a simple
00:21 - pistol a shotgun that fires multiple
00:23 - pellets and a rocket launcher with area
00:25 - of effect damage
00:26 - there's a zoom ability and a shield
00:28 - deflector there's also a really nice
00:30 - hook shot where the player aims towards
00:32 - the wall and gets pawn towards it
00:34 - there's two enemy types as well as a
00:36 - really cool embossed battle
00:37 - there's coins health pickups weapon
00:39 - pickups doors keys and tons more
00:42 - and just like the other games on the
00:43 - course all of this is built using only
00:45 - visual scripting so there's no code used
00:47 - anywhere
00:48 - everything is made using the official
00:50 - unity visual scripting tool
00:51 - and the course starts completely from
00:53 - scratch and goes through the making of
00:54 - several games step by step
00:55 - all of the project files and assets are
00:57 - included and i'm always available for
00:59 - answering questions in the q a section
01:01 - so like i said i've been working really
01:02 - hard on this one for the past few weeks
01:04 - and i'm almost done
01:05 - this one should be out by next week i'm
01:07 - really pleased with the final result and
01:08 - i'm really happy that i made the
01:09 - decision to work on this game as a
01:11 - future free update rather than trying to
01:13 - get it all done by the initial release
01:15 - making that decision gave me the time to
01:16 - do it on properly so the platformer and
01:18 - action rpg games are both great and then
01:21 - this fps also turned out great packed
01:22 - with tons of features
01:24 - so if you're interested in learning how
01:25 - to make games using visual scripting go
01:27 - check out the course
01:28 - the game builds upon the knowledge
01:30 - gained while making the other two games
01:31 - so go ahead pick up the course and go
01:33 - through those two in order to be ready
01:35 - for when this update goes live
01:37 - also just a quick mention the unity new
01:38 - year sale is almost
01:40 - over and in a few days check out the
01:42 - video where i covered some highlights
01:43 - and if you'd like pick up some assets to
01:45 - then using the fps game the going with
01:47 - my courses is always for you to learn
01:48 - how to make games and make them your own
01:50 - by using whatever assets you want
01:52 - so you can pick up some assets then use
01:54 - them when following the course
01:56 - alright so stay tuned for the fps free
01:58 - update coming out next week
01:59 - thanks for watching and i'll see you
02:01 - next time
