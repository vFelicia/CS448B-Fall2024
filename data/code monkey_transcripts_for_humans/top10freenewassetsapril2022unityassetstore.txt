01:31 - employers check it out with the link to

01:35 - alright so on to the top 10 list
01:37 - starting off with a pretty nice
01:39 - animation pack 32 animations that's
01:41 - quite a lot it's called rpg animations
01:43 - but really a lot of these work on any
01:45 - game you have idle walking strafing and
01:47 - so on some really nice rolls a bunch of
01:49 - melee attacks bow and even some magic
01:51 - animations this one is made by blink
01:53 - which is developer with tons more acids
01:55 - on the store then here's a fun tool a
01:58 - hand pose recognition
02:00 - it uses machine learning to identify it
02:02 - based on the quick video it works very
02:04 - well it is now required to have any
02:06 - special gloves or any special equipment
02:08 - you really just feed it an image and it
02:10 - will output whatever the pose is really
02:12 - interesting and up next nice and simple
02:15 - we have a modular house this one is
02:17 - pretty nice with some chinese
02:19 - architecture pretty unique
02:21 - it's got a realistic art style and looks
02:23 - pretty great then for a nice shader
02:25 - effect here is a see-through shader it
02:27 - allows you to see through walls or any
02:29 - other objects has tons of options to
02:31 - play around with then another fun
02:33 - animation pack from another great
02:35 - developer some free giant animations
02:37 - these would be perfect if your game has
02:39 - some kind of ogre or some giant or some
02:42 - elemental character
02:43 - this dev has tons of animation packs for
02:45 - all kinds of scenarios i own a bunch of
02:47 - them and i really like them and for a
02:48 - really simple tool here is a gradient
02:51 - generator it uses unity's built-in
02:53 - gradient tool to design whatever
02:55 - gradient you want
02:56 - then you can select the size select the
02:58 - path and save it onto a phone it's
02:59 - really simple and works great so if you
03:02 - need some gradients but you don't want
03:03 - to open up photoshop then this can be
03:05 - quite useful for another simple but
03:07 - great tool here is notes it allows you
03:09 - to add notes to all kinds of objects
03:12 - could be game objects or scripts or
03:13 - materials or really anything there's a
03:16 - window to only see all of your notes and
03:18 - even a nice button to ping the assets so
03:20 - you can find a quick one and up next for
03:22 - a fun visual here is a realistic
03:24 - computer keyboard both low poly and high
03:27 - poly it's exactly what you expect so if
03:29 - you need a keyboard here it is then
03:31 - here's a potentially very useful tool
03:33 - rich tax plus it lets you add tags onto
03:35 - your text objects then you can define
03:37 - those tags and what text they should be
03:39 - replaced with so it makes it super
03:41 - simple for example to display the player
03:43 - name and text or maybe some hotkeys that
03:44 - are customizable or really any dynamic
03:46 - text i've pretty much had to build a
03:48 - system just like this one in every game
03:50 - i've made so this is certainly useful
03:52 - and if you want to add some destruction
03:53 - to your games here's a bunch of nice
03:55 - destructible props i covered how you can
03:57 - slice objects in a previous video and
03:59 - this one pretty much just comes with
04:01 - pre-sliced objects alright so those are
04:03 - my top 10 free new assets on the unt s
04:05 - store for april 22 also check out my own
04:08 - free and paid ads on the store alright
04:10 - hope that's useful check out these
04:11 - videos to learn some more thanks to
04:13 - these awesome patreon supporters for
04:15 - making these videos possible thank you
04:17 - for watching and i'll see you next time
