00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's an interesting Video Game Dev
00:03 - mistakes that destroy your game
00:06 - [Music]
00:10 - three years of work on my game and
00:13 - nothing no sales no wish lists no money
00:16 - for the steam holiday sale wow right
00:18 - away yeah that stuff but suddenly that
00:20 - is not uncommon if anything my advice to
00:22 - you would be don't spend three years
00:24 - working on your game especially not your
00:26 - very first game when you're just
00:27 - starting out and you're trying to learn
00:29 - you really want to be able to learn with
00:30 - as little risk as possible so yeah for
00:32 - your very first game my advice is don't
00:34 - go anything further than some like two
00:36 - to three months I made a video quite a
00:37 - long time ago on seven steps you can
00:39 - take to become an end Dev and in the
00:41 - beginning I do say make tons and tons of
00:43 - games because you will learn so much
00:44 - more by actually finishing and
00:46 - Publishing a bunch of games you'll learn
00:47 - so much more than just working on one
00:49 - massive game over several years right
00:51 - now I'm working on my next team game
00:52 - which is meant to be a three to four
00:54 - month full-time project depending on
00:55 - your skills and experience you can get
00:57 - quite a lot done in a few months if you
00:58 - have a clear plan I don't know what I
01:00 - did wrong I need a Christmas miracle
01:06 - all right this game is going to be
01:08 - amazing I think I'll just start with all
01:10 - my art assets
01:12 - holy and this is the first mistake
01:15 - who are you
01:17 - I'm you and I'm here to save you from
01:19 - all of your beginner Game Dev mistakes
01:22 - I'm just making my art assets what's
01:24 - wrong with that exactly you spend way
01:27 - too much time on your art during the
01:29 - Prototype phase sure yeah that's an
01:31 - interesting tip you should definitely
01:32 - make a quick prototype in narrative to
01:34 - actually validate the idea however at
01:36 - the same time some game ideas are
01:38 - heavily influenced by the art
01:40 - so depending on what game you're trying
01:41 - to make it might not necessarily be a
01:43 - terrible idea to spend some time making
01:44 - the art assets although at the same time
01:46 - when I say spend some time I don't mean
01:48 - spend months maybe depending on the
01:50 - genre it might be why I suspend perhaps
01:52 - the very first week working on nothing
01:54 - but art assets trying to get the mood of
01:56 - your game figuring for something like a
01:57 - visual novel or a point of Click game
01:59 - something where the art is absolutely
02:01 - essential on those kinds of games that
02:03 - might not necessarily be a mistake but
02:05 - yeah for most games if you're making a
02:06 - platformer a strategy game a action game
02:08 - something like that then getting the
02:10 - gameplay up and running as quickly as
02:11 - possible that is definitely going to be
02:12 - much more important than spending tons
02:14 - of time on making polish art not to
02:16 - mention that as the game develops you
02:18 - won't permanently replace the art anyway
02:19 - so yeah there are some exceptions but in
02:21 - general yeah definitely don't spend way
02:22 - too long working on Art right at the
02:24 - very beginning by focusing on Art during
02:26 - this early phase you have less time to
02:29 - devote to making sure the gameplay
02:30 - within the Prototype is actually fun
02:33 - don't even use those assets I completely
02:35 - changed my art style later on yeah
02:38 - that's the thing that happens especially
02:40 - if you spend way too long in the game to
02:42 - the point where your skills actually
02:43 - improve and then you want to make you
02:45 - want to redraw the assets once again
02:46 - with better skills so yeah do not go
02:49 - overboard on the art right at the very
02:50 - beginning so I should just work on the
02:52 - ugly gray box prototype and yep
02:55 - definitely do spend time working on an
02:57 - ugly gray box prototype the thing is if
02:59 - your ugly gray box prototype if that
03:01 - thing is fun to play then when you add
03:03 - all kinds of visual Sparkle effects and
03:04 - punch on top it won't be even more fun
03:06 - to play so one good technique is
03:08 - definitely made tons of prototypes make
03:10 - them super quickly and then just
03:12 - experiments and see which one of those
03:13 - actually plays right because again if it
03:15 - does play great while it's looking
03:17 - terrible then it won't feel extremely
03:19 - awesome when you finally add all kinds
03:21 - of polishing visuals gameplay Loop
03:22 - instead you would have had a much
03:24 - stronger gameplay Foundation
03:26 - hence the first mistake not focusing on
03:29 - gameplay early making a game involves a
03:32 - lot of moving parts and it's extremely
03:35 - easy to get distracted by all the things
03:37 - that need to be built making a finished
03:39 - character asset and Polished textures
03:41 - may make the Prototype more visually
03:43 - appealing but the main thing that will
03:45 - make people wishlist buy and play your
03:48 - game is the game part visuals May grab
03:51 - someone's attention but the gameplay
03:53 - will make them stay also related to this
03:55 - is when you're trying to make some kind
03:57 - of demo or perhaps a vertical slice in
03:58 - order to get funding from a publisher in
04:00 - this case this comes after this phase
04:02 - after the pro timing phase when you have
04:04 - the game nice and solid it can be wise
04:06 - to spend a bunch of time just polishing
04:08 - just a tiny sliver of the game just
04:10 - making what is called the vertical slice
04:11 - just doing that getting that all
04:13 - polished up as much as possible in order
04:15 - to hopefully get some funding or maybe
04:17 - start to promote your receipt page
04:19 - two years
04:22 - hey I'm back what are you working on
04:26 - oh God I made it just in time I followed
04:30 - your advice and focused on gameplay I'm
04:32 - just doing some some play testing which
04:34 - is super great but my brother in game
04:36 - devs you're just asking your friends and
04:38 - family to play today well yeah but
04:40 - asking strangers is hard and scary who's
04:42 - gonna play your game and do you think
04:44 - your friends and family are going to
04:45 - give you a solid critiques yeah I guess
04:48 - not so what should I do well for
04:50 - starters ask your friends and family but
04:52 - take their feedback with a grain of salt
04:54 - yeah friends and family are definitely
04:56 - great for a first initial thing but you
04:58 - always got to keep in mind where that
05:00 - feedback comes from always keep in mind
05:01 - that feedback is always going to be
05:03 - slightly biased towards the positive
05:04 - side because they're friends and family
05:06 - they're your friends so they're not
05:07 - going to be brutally honest at least not
05:09 - as really honest as actual scene players
05:11 - won't be when you finally release your
05:13 - game so do get them to play your game
05:15 - and read through their feedback but do
05:17 - keep that positive bias in mind I just
05:19 - had a similar example to this when I
05:21 - recently released the seam neck Fest
05:23 - demo for my game most of the feedback
05:24 - that I got were actually from people
05:26 - that found this Channel and if they
05:28 - watch his channel if they enjoy the
05:29 - videos that I do there will definitely
05:30 - be much more biased towards the positive
05:32 - side rather than the regular steam
05:33 - audience you want strangers anyone and
05:36 - everyone to test your game flight
05:38 - testing often gets pushed aside during
05:40 - the development process or you put it at
05:42 - the very end but in reality you want
05:44 - people to be testing your game early and
05:46 - often play testing is really market
05:48 - research it lets you know how people are
05:51 - receiving your game your mechanics your
05:53 - art style and gives you an idea where
05:56 - you might be blind to certain issues
05:58 - with your game so get initial
06:00 - Impressions favorite parts parts they
06:02 - hated and things they think are missing
06:04 - every piece of information is useful
06:07 - yeah waiting list of things definitely
06:09 - get their initial Impressions read so
06:11 - many games nowadays you really gotta
06:12 - hook the player as soon as possible
06:13 - especially since nowadays going on a
06:15 - steam Festival is super important and on
06:18 - a scene Festival you are providing a
06:19 - free demo and you are competing with
06:20 - tens of thousands of other demos so for
06:22 - that you really got just a few minutes
06:24 - in order to really hook the player so
06:25 - initial impressions are extremely
06:26 - important the favorite Parts also really
06:28 - important in order to figure out what
06:30 - people like about your game so you can
06:31 - do more of those least favorite parts so
06:33 - you can either reward worth the design
06:35 - in order to make them not the least
06:36 - favorite in order to make them a bit
06:37 - better or perhaps just cut them out
06:39 - entirely at some point there are some
06:41 - mechanics that just don't work no matter
06:43 - how much you want them to so in order to
06:44 - improve the game sometimes cutting a
06:46 - mechanic is really the best approach and
06:48 - things missing like if lots of your
06:50 - players are telling you oh I wish I
06:52 - could pause the game to take my time and
06:53 - go things slowly that is really great
06:55 - feedback on things that might be missing
06:57 - that might even be super easy to add but
06:59 - you might have never thought about and
07:00 - that might make your game much much
07:02 - better you don't need to implement every
07:04 - single idea or change but at least be
07:06 - aware of how your game is being received
07:07 - yeah definitely also that's another
07:09 - thing do not just blindly Implement
07:12 - every idea that anyone tells you
07:13 - remember that you are a developer so you
07:15 - know best what your game should be like
07:17 - you know with the idea that you have in
07:19 - your head and what you're actually
07:20 - trying to accomplish so always keep that
07:22 - in mind make sure you don't Implement
07:23 - every single idea that you get if you do
07:25 - then the final game won't just be a
07:27 - mishmash of different ideas that might
07:28 - not go together in the end it's really
07:30 - up to you as the developer to figure out
07:32 - which ideas to take and which ones you
07:33 - should ignore more okay so focus on
07:36 - gameplay and have people test it so you
07:39 - can refine it right and while you do the
07:41 - play testing you're also getting
07:43 - networking contacts for future tests and
07:45 - potential buyers once the game is
07:48 - finished so in general play testing
07:50 - really good asking more than just your
07:52 - friends and family to play test your
07:54 - game that is extremely good but
07:55 - obviously the big problem is where do
07:57 - you find those people and that can be
07:58 - quite a bit tricky you can perhaps look
08:01 - into Reddit there are some communities
08:02 - that might play your game there are some
08:04 - discords with lots of developers who
08:05 - play each other games you might look
08:07 - into itch.io there might be some forms
08:09 - and some areas over there to find the
08:11 - community or alternatively you can kind
08:12 - of do what I've done which is make a
08:14 - YouTube channel grow that YouTube
08:16 - channel over time with whatever game
08:17 - that related videos you have like
08:19 - perhaps devlogs or something like that
08:20 - and then you have an audience that if
08:22 - you ask them to test your game they
08:23 - might be able to do that so plenty of
08:25 - options to find plate testers other than
08:28 - just your friends and family
08:31 - okay I remember this I was crunching
08:33 - trying to get all the features but
08:34 - together it kept breaking every time I
08:37 - added something yeah this this plugin
08:40 - won't work it says it works for
08:41 - massively multiplayer RPG action
08:44 - adventure racing open world VR games
08:45 - okay maybe I added one too many features
08:48 - yes scope creep is yet another beginner
08:50 - Game Dev mistake I myself I'm definitely
08:53 - not immune to that when I started making
08:55 - Flash games around my third Flash game I
08:57 - suddenly had the brilliant idea why
08:58 - don't I make a massive MMO game it was
09:01 - meant to be something with like cops and
09:02 - robbers so it was going to have dozens
09:05 - or hundreds of people on the same map
09:06 - some people would try to rub some bangs
09:08 - others would try to stop them obviously
09:10 - after working on that project for a
09:12 - bunch of months it didn't go anywhere so
09:13 - I ended up abandoning it but yeah this
09:15 - is definitely a big problem and you
09:17 - should definitely keep track of it make
09:18 - sure you don't go way too overboard but
09:20 - at the same time if it does happen don't
09:22 - get too down on yourself it seems like
09:23 - this happens to literally everyone
09:26 - foreign
09:27 - making games is sometimes like the Wild
09:29 - Wild West a free open world of
09:32 - opportunity and that freedom can be a
09:35 - big problem yeah freedom is definitely
09:37 - both a positive and negative it's great
09:39 - to be able to do anything I mean it's
09:40 - your game so you can literally add
09:42 - anything you want onto that game but at
09:44 - the same time not having any constraints
09:45 - means you might get caught up trying to
09:47 - add things more and more and more and
09:49 - you never actually end up finishing
09:50 - anything it is indeed a double-edged
09:52 - sword so always be very careful when you
09:54 - add a new mechanic when you come up with
09:55 - a new idea always think to yourself okay
09:57 - this is actually enhancy core idea that
09:59 - I already have if so then perhaps that
10:02 - might be a good addition if not if it's
10:03 - just something you added just because on
10:05 - a whim you suddenly decide to add some
10:07 - more mechanics if so then perhaps it
10:09 - might be wise to keep that on a drawer
10:10 - put that underneath to play around with
10:12 - in the future in case you have time but
10:14 - for now focus on actually finishing the
10:16 - core game idea that you have we all love
10:18 - games and it might be why you started
10:19 - making games all together and sometimes
10:22 - you might want to add every single
10:23 - feature from every favorite game you've
10:25 - ever played so when you're feeling the
10:27 - urge to add a new gameplay feature ask
10:29 - yourself does it fit my existing design
10:32 - if you answered no then focus on getting
10:34 - what you have to a point where you can
10:36 - add new features and if you want to add
10:38 - something anyway
10:39 - prototype it and play test it yep
10:42 - definitely great tip great advice if
10:45 - you're going to add some brand new
10:46 - mechanic to your game especially if it's
10:48 - something complex that is going to take
10:49 - quite a bit of effort perhaps try making
10:51 - just a prototype of that initial idea
10:52 - just get the basics up and running in
10:54 - order to actually test does this idea
10:55 - actually work only it actually improve
10:58 - the final game so remember that when it
11:00 - comes to prototyping you can prototype
11:02 - not just the actual full game idea but
11:04 - individual systems you can always get
11:06 - just the core of it working just enough
11:08 - in order to figure out does this work on
11:09 - the sexual improve the game
11:12 - it brings me to one final piece of
11:14 - advice while you don't want to introduce
11:16 - too many new features don't be afraid to
11:19 - borrow from some of your favorite games
11:21 - yeah definitely I mean if you got into
11:23 - game development chances are you got
11:24 - into it because you actually enjoy
11:26 - playing games so therefore look into the
11:28 - games that you play the things that you
11:29 - enjoy trying to analyze them trying to
11:31 - look at them with a game designer eye
11:33 - and try to see why do those features
11:35 - work why those systems work what makes
11:37 - them so compelling that is one great way
11:39 - you can improve your game play similar
11:41 - games and don't just necessarily copy
11:43 - things just copy paste but actually
11:45 - figure out why those Mechanics Work why
11:47 - those systems work and perhaps they
11:49 - might be applicable to your game in some
11:50 - way you likely got into game development
11:53 - because of the games that inspired you
11:54 - to do so and sometimes listening to the
11:57 - inspiration and keep you going with it
11:59 - going it's hard if you find yourself
12:01 - losing motivation check out this video
12:04 - to learn how to deal with burnout
12:05 - alright that was a great video lots of
12:08 - really interesting tips definitely
12:09 - mistakes that many people might have
12:11 - fallen for so if you're a beginner and
12:13 - you're watching this definitely keep in
12:14 - mind all these mistakes make sure you
12:16 - don't do them and they won't really help
12:17 - you on your Game Dev Journey alright so
12:19 - go ahead and watch the original video
12:20 - And subscribe to stay at home Dev I hope
12:22 - you found this interesting thanks for
12:23 - watching and I'll see you next time
12:36 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's an interesting Video Game Dev mistakes that destroy your game three years of work on my game and nothing no sales no wish lists no money for the steam holiday sale wow right away yeah that stuff but suddenly that is not uncommon if anything my advice to you would be don't spend three years working on your game especially not your very first game when you're just starting out and you're trying to learn you really want to be able to learn with as little risk as possible so yeah for your very first game my advice is don't go anything further than some like two to three months I made a video quite a long time ago on seven steps you can take to become an end Dev and in the beginning I do say make tons and tons of games because you will learn so much more by actually finishing and Publishing a bunch of games you'll learn so much more than just working on one massive game over several years right now I'm working on my next team game which is meant to be a three to four month fulltime project depending on your skills and experience you can get quite a lot done in a few months if you have a clear plan I don't know what I did wrong I need a Christmas miracle all right this game is going to be amazing I think I'll just start with all my art assets holy and this is the first mistake who are you I'm you and I'm here to save you from all of your beginner Game Dev mistakes I'm just making my art assets what's wrong with that exactly you spend way too much time on your art during the Prototype phase sure yeah that's an interesting tip you should definitely make a quick prototype in narrative to actually validate the idea however at the same time some game ideas are heavily influenced by the art so depending on what game you're trying to make it might not necessarily be a terrible idea to spend some time making the art assets although at the same time when I say spend some time I don't mean spend months maybe depending on the genre it might be why I suspend perhaps the very first week working on nothing but art assets trying to get the mood of your game figuring for something like a visual novel or a point

action game something like that then getting the gameplay up and running as quickly as possible that is definitely going to be much more important than spending tons of time on making polish art not to mention that as the game develops you won't permanently replace the art anyway so yeah there are some exceptions but in general yeah definitely don't spend way too long working on Art right at the very beginning by focusing on Art during this early phase you have less time to devote to making sure the gameplay within the Prototype is actually fun don't even use those assets I completely changed my art style later on yeah that's the thing that happens especially if you spend way too long in the game to the point where your skills actually improve and then you want to make you want to redraw the assets once again with better skills so yeah do not go overboard on the art right at the very beginning so I should just work on the ugly gray box prototype and yep definitely do spend time working on an ugly gray box prototype the thing is if your ugly gray box prototype if that thing is fun to play then when you add all kinds of visual Sparkle effects and punch on top it won't be even more fun to play so one good technique is definitely made tons of prototypes make them super quickly and then just experiments and see which one of those actually plays right because again if it does play great while it's looking terrible then it won't feel extremely awesome when you finally add all kinds of polishing visuals gameplay Loop instead you would have had a much stronger gameplay Foundation hence the first mistake not focusing on gameplay early making a game involves a lot of moving parts and it's extremely easy to get distracted by all the things that need to be built making a finished character asset and Polished textures may make the Prototype more visually appealing but the main thing that will make people wishlist buy and play your game is the game part visuals May grab someone's attention but the gameplay will make them stay also related to this is when you're trying to make some kind of demo or perhaps a vertical slice in order to get funding from a publisher in this case this comes after this phase after the pro timing phase when you have the game nice and solid it can be wise to spend a bunch of time just polishing just a tiny sliver of the game just making what is called the vertical slice just doing that getting that all polished up as much as possible in order to hopefully get some funding or maybe start to promote your receipt page two years hey I'm back what are you working on oh God I made it just in time I followed your advice and focused on gameplay I'm just doing some some play testing which is super great but my brother in game devs you're just asking your friends and family to play today well yeah but asking strangers is hard and scary who's gonna play your game and do you think your friends and family are going to give you a solid critiques yeah I guess not so what should I do well for starters ask your friends and family but take their feedback with a grain of salt yeah friends and family are definitely great for a first initial thing but you always got to keep in mind where that feedback comes from always keep in mind that feedback is always going to be slightly biased towards the positive side because they're friends and family they're your friends so they're not going to be brutally honest at least not as really honest as actual scene players won't be when you finally release your game so do get them to play your game and read through their feedback but do keep that positive bias in mind I just had a similar example to this when I recently released the seam neck Fest demo for my game most of the feedback that I got were actually from people that found this Channel and if they watch his channel if they enjoy the videos that I do there will definitely be much more biased towards the positive side rather than the regular steam audience you want strangers anyone and everyone to test your game flight testing often gets pushed aside during the development process or you put it at the very end but in reality you want people to be testing your game early and often play testing is really market research it lets you know how people are receiving your game your mechanics your art style and gives you an idea where you might be blind to certain issues with your game so get initial Impressions favorite parts parts they hated and things they think are missing every piece of information is useful yeah waiting list of things definitely get their initial Impressions read so many games nowadays you really gotta hook the player as soon as possible especially since nowadays going on a steam Festival is super important and on a scene Festival you are providing a free demo and you are competing with tens of thousands of other demos so for that you really got just a few minutes in order to really hook the player so initial impressions are extremely important the favorite Parts also really important in order to figure out what people like about your game so you can do more of those least favorite parts so you can either reward worth the design in order to make them not the least favorite in order to make them a bit better or perhaps just cut them out entirely at some point there are some mechanics that just don't work no matter how much you want them to so in order to improve the game sometimes cutting a mechanic is really the best approach and things missing like if lots of your players are telling you oh I wish I could pause the game to take my time and go things slowly that is really great feedback on things that might be missing that might even be super easy to add but you might have never thought about and that might make your game much much better you don't need to implement every single idea or change but at least be aware of how your game is being received yeah definitely also that's another thing do not just blindly Implement every idea that anyone tells you remember that you are a developer so you know best what your game should be like you know with the idea that you have in your head and what you're actually trying to accomplish so always keep that in mind make sure you don't Implement every single idea that you get if you do then the final game won't just be a mishmash of different ideas that might not go together in the end it's really up to you as the developer to figure out which ideas to take and which ones you should ignore more okay so focus on gameplay and have people test it so you can refine it right and while you do the play testing you're also getting networking contacts for future tests and potential buyers once the game is finished so in general play testing really good asking more than just your friends and family to play test your game that is extremely good but obviously the big problem is where do you find those people and that can be quite a bit tricky you can perhaps look into Reddit there are some communities that might play your game there are some discords with lots of developers who play each other games you might look into itch.io there might be some forms and some areas over there to find the community or alternatively you can kind of do what I've done which is make a YouTube channel grow that YouTube channel over time with whatever game that related videos you have like perhaps devlogs or something like that and then you have an audience that if you ask them to test your game they might be able to do that so plenty of options to find plate testers other than just your friends and family okay I remember this I was crunching trying to get all the features but together it kept breaking every time I added something yeah this this plugin won't work it says it works for massively multiplayer RPG action adventure racing open world VR games okay maybe I added one too many features yes scope creep is yet another beginner Game Dev mistake I myself I'm definitely not immune to that when I started making Flash games around my third Flash game I suddenly had the brilliant idea why don't I make a massive MMO game it was meant to be something with like cops and robbers so it was going to have dozens or hundreds of people on the same map some people would try to rub some bangs others would try to stop them obviously after working on that project for a bunch of months it didn't go anywhere so I ended up abandoning it but yeah this is definitely a big problem and you should definitely keep track of it make sure you don't go way too overboard but at the same time if it does happen don't get too down on yourself it seems like this happens to literally everyone foreign making games is sometimes like the Wild Wild West a free open world of opportunity and that freedom can be a big problem yeah freedom is definitely both a positive and negative it's great to be able to do anything I mean it's your game so you can literally add anything you want onto that game but at the same time not having any constraints means you might get caught up trying to add things more and more and more and you never actually end up finishing anything it is indeed a doubleedged sword so always be very careful when you add a new mechanic when you come up with a new idea always think to yourself okay this is actually enhancy core idea that I already have if so then perhaps that might be a good addition if not if it's just something you added just because on a whim you suddenly decide to add some more mechanics if so then perhaps it might be wise to keep that on a drawer put that underneath to play around with in the future in case you have time but for now focus on actually finishing the core game idea that you have we all love games and it might be why you started making games all together and sometimes you might want to add every single feature from every favorite game you've ever played so when you're feeling the urge to add a new gameplay feature ask yourself does it fit my existing design if you answered no then focus on getting what you have to a point where you can add new features and if you want to add something anyway prototype it and play test it yep definitely great tip great advice if you're going to add some brand new mechanic to your game especially if it's something complex that is going to take quite a bit of effort perhaps try making just a prototype of that initial idea just get the basics up and running in order to actually test does this idea actually work only it actually improve the final game so remember that when it comes to prototyping you can prototype not just the actual full game idea but individual systems you can always get just the core of it working just enough in order to figure out does this work on the sexual improve the game it brings me to one final piece of advice while you don't want to introduce too many new features don't be afraid to borrow from some of your favorite games yeah definitely I mean if you got into game development chances are you got into it because you actually enjoy playing games so therefore look into the games that you play the things that you enjoy trying to analyze them trying to look at them with a game designer eye and try to see why do those features work why those systems work what makes them so compelling that is one great way you can improve your game play similar games and don't just necessarily copy things just copy paste but actually figure out why those Mechanics Work why those systems work and perhaps they might be applicable to your game in some way you likely got into game development because of the games that inspired you to do so and sometimes listening to the inspiration and keep you going with it going it's hard if you find yourself losing motivation check out this video to learn how to deal with burnout alright that was a great video lots of really interesting tips definitely mistakes that many people might have fallen for so if you're a beginner and you're watching this definitely keep in mind all these mistakes make sure you don't do them and they won't really help you on your Game Dev Journey alright so go ahead and watch the original video And subscribe to stay at home Dev I hope you found this interesting thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
