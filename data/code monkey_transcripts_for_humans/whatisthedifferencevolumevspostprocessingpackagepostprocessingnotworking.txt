00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a super quick video on
00:03 - something that beginners might find
00:05 - confusing especially when following some
00:07 - older tutorials that is the difference
00:09 - between the post-processing component
00:11 - and the volume component which one you
00:13 - should be using depends on the render
00:14 - pipeline that you're using if you use
00:16 - the wrong one then you won't see post
00:17 - processing working and in urp you also
00:19 - need to enable some settings so nowadays
00:22 - you should be using either urp or hrp
00:24 - probably urp since it's meant to run on
00:26 - everything and runs very well it's what
00:28 - i always use however if you're following
00:31 - another tutorial it might be using the
00:32 - legacy render pipeline whereas you are
00:34 - probably using urp so you might follow a
00:37 - tutorial and in that tutorial they tell
00:38 - you to go into window and open up the
00:40 - package manager
00:41 - then over here go into the ent registry
00:44 - and scroll down until you find the post
00:46 - processing package so this one
00:48 - so it might tell you to install this
00:50 - package
00:51 - so you install it and then it might tell
00:53 - you to create a new game object name it
00:55 - something like post processing
00:57 - then add a component and find the post
00:59 - processing volume
01:01 - then make a global create a new post
01:03 - crossing profile and add a bunch of
01:04 - effects
01:05 - so here i have a bunch of effects but as
01:07 - you can see it does not change anything
01:09 - so if i'm looking to scene view and
01:11 - camera view if i'm looking to both these
01:13 - nope they all still look the same so i
01:14 - can enable or disable this and nope
01:16 - nothing changes
01:17 - again this is the issue the issue is
01:19 - because this specific post crossing
01:20 - volume this one is meant to be used in
01:22 - conjunction with the legacy built-in
01:23 - rather pipeline so if you're using urp
01:26 - then this won't work we can test that by
01:28 - going into edit project settings then
01:30 - under graphics as you can see i'm using
01:32 - urp but if i clear this then i go back
01:34 - into the legacy render pipeline now if i
01:36 - close this if i go into the camera and
01:38 - on the camera i had the post process
01:39 - layer component
01:41 - make sure it triggers on everything
01:43 - there you go now it does apply that post
01:44 - processing
01:45 - so this one right here the post process
01:47 - volume this is the one that you use for
01:48 - the legacy render pipeline but like i
01:50 - said chances are you're using urp
01:53 - so if i go back in here and i once again
01:55 - assign my universal render pipeline
01:56 - asset
01:57 - with this one no post crossing volume
01:59 - does not do anything
02:01 - so when working with the urp you do not
02:03 - use this component so let's remove this
02:04 - and instead use the volume component
02:08 - this one then you can create a new
02:09 - profile and add the effect just as usual
02:12 - and yep this is how it works
02:13 - now if you have the correct post
02:15 - processing component but you still don't
02:16 - see the effects happening if so then you
02:19 - can go watch my video on my glow
02:20 - checklist here very quickly in order to
02:22 - make this work you just need to make
02:23 - sure you go into the camera and in here
02:25 - enable post processing
02:27 - specifically for glow you need to go
02:28 - into the render pipeline asset and
02:30 - enable hdr
02:32 - and finally on the render itself you
02:33 - need to go here and enable post
02:35 - processing if you do all of those and
02:37 - you're using urp and you're using the
02:39 - volume component if you do all of that
02:41 - then you should be able to see post
02:42 - crossing work perfectly also one more
02:44 - tiny thing on the scene view just in
02:46 - case you don't see it the scene view up
02:48 - here on the top right corner you see a
02:50 - whole bunch of buttons
02:52 - and there's this one right here with a
02:53 - little star you can click on it to
02:54 - enable all of them or click on here
02:56 - and then you can enable or disable post
02:58 - processing also over here on scene view
03:00 - so click to enable or disable
03:02 - alright so now you know the difference
03:04 - between the volume and the
03:05 - post-processing volume components
03:07 - you should be using urp and if you are
03:09 - and if you find no tutorial using the
03:11 - all post processing stack then now you
03:13 - know when using urp use the volume
03:14 - component instead it does not require
03:16 - any package anything at all you just add
03:18 - the volume component instead of the old
03:20 - post crossing volume alright hope that's
03:22 - useful check out these videos to learn
03:24 - some more thanks to these awesome
03:26 - patreon supporters for making these
03:27 - videos possible thank you for watching
03:29 - and i'll see you next time
