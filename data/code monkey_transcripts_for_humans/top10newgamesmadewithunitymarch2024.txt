00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod M and
00:02 - here let's check out the top new games
00:03 - made with unity launch in March 24 this
00:05 - was an interesting month there were
00:07 - maybe 30 or 40 games that I found really
00:09 - interesting but actually a surprisingly
00:11 - amount of them had some issues and had
00:13 - some mixed reviews although even without
00:15 - those it was still really tricky to pick
00:16 - just 10 for this list there were plenty
00:18 - that look very interesting and were well
00:19 - made the reason why I make these videos
00:21 - is to show you everything that the
00:22 - engine can do the limit is really just
00:24 - your own skills and Imagination and the
00:25 - variety and the awesomeness of the game
00:27 - shown here really puts out to the test
00:29 - all these games are in impressive so the
00:30 - list is in no particular order except
00:32 - for the number one game that is my
00:33 - personal pick of the month quick mention
00:35 - I just released the free intermediate
00:37 - section for my C course so now both the
00:39 - beginner and intermediate sections are
00:40 - free over here on YouTube the advanced
00:42 - section will be coming out in about 1 to
00:43 - two months I hope you'll learn a lot
00:45 - from these free videos or get the
00:47 - premium version which includes a bunch
00:49 - of awesome bonuses like interactive
00:50 - exercise help you learn by doing and if
00:52 - you need any assets then check out the
00:54 - spring sell on the accur whether you
00:55 - need visual sounds effects tools you can
00:57 - find pretty much anything to help you
00:59 - make your own games I covered some of my
01:01 - favorites that I think can really help
01:02 - you in the last video and check out the
01:03 - Flash Deals page which shows what assets
01:05 - are going to be 70% off in the future
01:07 - check it out to the links in the
01:08 - description all right so starting off at
01:10 - number 10 with a very silly very
01:12 - frustrating game titled a difficult game
01:14 - about climbing you've probably already
01:16 - heard about this one it's been a huge
01:18 - hit with all kinds of streamers and it's
01:20 - made by YouTuber Ponty pants who also
01:21 - made punch a bunch this is a game very
01:23 - much like getting over it and other rage
01:25 - games like that one controls are very
01:27 - tight but the map is extremely difficult
01:29 - if you you fail you drop down to almost
01:31 - the beginning with only a handful of
01:33 - checkpoints along the way you control
01:34 - the hands of the character just move and
01:36 - grab either the left hand or the right
01:38 - hand and then it's all about using
01:39 - momentum to fling yourself from position
01:41 - to position as you try to climb higher
01:43 - and higher there's lots of Hazards like
01:45 - slippery walls and falling water that
01:46 - won't push you down as well as some
01:48 - areas that really just require a leap of
01:50 - faith now personally I'm not really a
01:51 - fan of this genre I don't enjoy feeling
01:53 - frustrating but if you are into these
01:55 - types of games and this is an extremely
01:57 - well-made one like I said this one is
01:58 - already a huge hit it's got over 2,000
02:01 - very positive reviews which means that
02:02 - has sold almost 100,000 copies which is
02:05 - an insane amount if that game is too
02:06 - frustrating and instead you want
02:08 - something super chill here is
02:09 - summerhouse it's a relaxing house
02:11 - building game there are no rules no game
02:13 - over screens you just load up a very
02:16 - calming scene like for example in front
02:17 - of a lake and then start building your
02:19 - dream home Brick by Brick you place the
02:21 - walls place the windows then put down
02:23 - some stairs unlock hidden characters and
02:25 - really just enjoy yourself there's no
02:27 - win or lose condition this is really
02:29 - just game meant for relaxing if you're
02:31 - into games like townscaper or DF
02:32 - romantic then you'll probably love this
02:34 - one it seems a lot of people are looking
02:36 - for a relaxing game to play this one
02:37 - already has over a, overwhelmingly
02:40 - positive views at 96% positive that's
02:42 - really awesome super high next up here
02:44 - we have a game all about chaos called
02:46 - Maniac it looks like a really nice mix
02:49 - between the GTA 1 and meter coupled with
02:51 - the game posel in theory it's a simple
02:53 - game with some shooting driving and some
02:55 - Rog light upgrades but in reality it's
02:57 - extremely well made the game looks
02:59 - really great great in motion both in
03:01 - terms of visuals with some really
03:02 - gorgeous natural lighting but also in
03:04 - terms of physics and effects with lots
03:06 - of objects and plenty of particles
03:08 - flying all over the place I wonder if
03:09 - this game is made using dots the amount
03:11 - of objects on screen is really quite
03:13 - impressive you've got lots of weapons
03:15 - lots of vehicles there are six unique
03:17 - characters with skills a large open
03:18 - world and even has a map editor you've
03:20 - got all of that and the goal is to cause
03:22 - chaos and follow along as he wanted
03:24 - meter climbs with tons of levels this
03:26 - game is a great example of how even with
03:28 - a simple concept you can't technically
03:30 - find success although of course that
03:31 - only happens if your execution is
03:33 - absolutely Flawless which is definitely
03:35 - not easy to achieve this game is indeed
03:37 - finding quite a lot of success it
03:38 - already has over 500 very positive views
03:41 - so probably over 20,000 copies sold in
03:43 - just 3 days next up for a city-builder
03:45 - exploration game here is buar funer
03:48 - Chronicles it's a very unique Builder
03:50 - game the world is very much non-standard
03:52 - with lots of mountains and you build
03:54 - tons of bridges to connect all kinds of
03:56 - buildings the footage of all the cities
03:57 - is really unlike any other game it's own
03:59 - very vertical with lots of interesting
04:01 - connections you build some ships and
04:02 - some airships then you take them out and
04:04 - explore this dangerous world with plenty
04:06 - of foes and Mysteries to uncover this
04:08 - game is actually related to the previous
04:10 - one that this Dev made the falconer that
04:11 - was a game where he control a falcon and
04:13 - explore an open world while Gathering
04:15 - some resources and attacking enemies so
04:17 - something like a playe flying game
04:19 - whereas this one is setting the same
04:20 - world but completely different in terms
04:22 - of gameplay honestly I love this sort of
04:23 - thing and I really wish more Indies
04:25 - would do this basically make multiple
04:26 - games with different mechanics different
04:28 - genes but share these same world it's
04:30 - really hard to do it right which is why
04:32 - most don't even attempt it but when it
04:33 - works like in this case I think it makes
04:35 - the game a little bit more interesting
04:36 - this one is being very well received
04:38 - already over 300 reviews at very
04:40 - positive so that's about 12,000 copies
04:42 - sold in one week really nice then if
04:43 - you're looking for an adventure deep
04:45 - underground check out subterrain minds
04:47 - of Titan it's a turnbas survival RPG you
04:50 - explore this large world and survive
04:52 - against all kinds of enemies make sure
04:53 - to pick the right stats and the right
04:55 - equipment or risk dying every action you
04:57 - do every single movement all of that
04:59 - moves the time forward so you have to be
05:01 - careful with every single action you
05:03 - take time is really of the essence food
05:05 - water and oxygen are scarce other
05:07 - surviving colonists also need help with
05:08 - their task so you need to salvage
05:10 - whatever materials you can find break
05:12 - them down into raw resources and use
05:14 - those resources to build up weapons and
05:15 - armor in order to survive your next
05:17 - exergon visually it looks gorgeous with
05:19 - some really high quality pixel art some
05:21 - great lighting and effects it is out now
05:22 - with 350 mostly positive reviews with
05:25 - some people disliking the turn Bas style
05:27 - but if you're into that then definitely
05:28 - check this one out next up if if you'd
05:29 - like to make your own spells then check
05:31 - out spell dis this is a Rog light action
05:34 - game lots of enemies to defeat kind of
05:36 - like vampire survivors the one unique
05:38 - Twist on this one is how you have a lot
05:40 - of control over your attacks you
05:42 - actually build and customize your
05:43 - attacks by connecting different elements
05:45 - and individual attacks together for
05:47 - example you can fire a chain which in
05:49 - turn triggers an electricity spell which
05:51 - in turn triggers a fire spell which in
05:53 - turn fires a fireball which in turn
05:55 - triggers an ie and then throws a normal
05:57 - dagger there's various based classes and
05:59 - lots of items and spells that you can
06:00 - combine in ways that no one has ever
06:02 - seen that spell before not even the
06:03 - developer so the potential here for
06:05 - experimentation is really quite insane
06:07 - you can easily save and load your unique
06:09 - build so you can keep experimenting or
06:10 - just go back to something that works you
06:12 - craft a build unlock new items make
06:14 - another better build go out again and do
06:16 - it all over again this one just left
06:18 - early access with a full 1.0 release
06:20 - it's got 600 very positive reviews next
06:22 - if you'd like to play a factory Colony
06:24 - building game but with a chill Vibe here
06:27 - is Stellar settler space based Builder
06:29 - it's it's your job to settle on five
06:31 - hostile alien planets and build a
06:32 - thriving Colony you can build both
06:34 - horizontally and vertically gather
06:36 - resources connect your buildings and
06:38 - processing materials then pick from
06:40 - various settlers with different sets and
06:42 - set them to work on some pod the reviews
06:44 - mention how it's a little bit more heavy
06:45 - on the puzzle side than on Colony
06:47 - building so you have to be careful about
06:49 - where you place each settler each planet
06:50 - is unique with different disasters and
06:52 - biomes and after you have enough
06:54 - resource to build up your rocket ship
06:56 - after that you can build them but you
06:58 - have to make sure that you do it care ly
07:00 - because the spaceship that one is
07:01 - physics based so you definitely need to
07:03 - make sure to build it properly if you
07:04 - want to actually get up to space it is
07:06 - out now in Early Access and they have a
07:08 - pre- robust road map with a 1.0 release
07:10 - planned in mid to late 25 then here we
07:13 - have godsworn this is very much a
07:15 - classic RTS in the vein of something
07:17 - like Warcraft you have lots of units and
07:19 - buildings you can control alongside a
07:21 - mythical hero this definitely perfectly
07:22 - encapsulates the feeling of those old
07:24 - school RTS for me I was more of a fan of
07:27 - games like man and Conquer rather than
07:28 - games with some Heroes but this one does
07:30 - look great it has a story campaign that
07:32 - you can play in ated single player or
07:34 - Co-op it's got a nice engaging story all
07:36 - about mythical gods and how their tribes
07:38 - fight one another you construct some
07:40 - buildings gather your units and prepare
07:41 - for battle it is out now in Early Access
07:43 - and people are loving it with 200
07:45 - reviews at 94% positive so if you're
07:47 - into classic AR style with some Heroes
07:49 - definitely check that out up next here's
07:51 - an interesting one titled The Brew
07:53 - Barons this one is a flying and beer
07:56 - crafting management game a very unique
07:58 - very strange mix there are apparently
07:59 - some pirates in this world and those
08:01 - pirates have boats and planes and they
08:03 - want to control the supply of beer so
08:05 - your job is to essentially take them out
08:07 - you do some combat to take out all the
08:09 - Pirates planes then craft some beer and
08:11 - distribute it you can customize a ton of
08:13 - parts in your plane each part giving you
08:15 - different bonuses like for example
08:16 - letting you harvest more of a certain
08:18 - resource or spend less gas for Gathering
08:20 - the ingredients you really just fly
08:21 - around and shoot some trees then you buy
08:23 - some ingredients throw them in the pot
08:25 - let them ferment and outome some beer
08:27 - which you can then customize how you
08:28 - want to bottle this game is a very
08:30 - strange very unique idea personally I
08:32 - quite like it I think it looks great it
08:34 - is out now with 400 mostly positive
08:36 - reviews the one negative that reviews
08:37 - mention is just how the plane feels too
08:39 - heavy which maybe is intentional since
08:41 - these are really not fire planes and
08:43 - then at number one for my personal pick
08:44 - of the month if you're into some
08:45 - turn-based strategy set in World War II
08:47 - then here is classified France 44 this
08:50 - is a mix of Commandos which was a game
08:52 - that I love playing as a kid mixed with
08:53 - XCOM which is another game that I love
08:55 - and I also really love games about Gilla
08:57 - Warfare that is why I prefer XCOM 2 to
08:59 - XCOM one in this one you control some
09:01 - elite units as you sneak Behind Enemy
09:03 - Lines and it's up to you to engage in a
09:05 - campaign of sabotage and destruction but
09:07 - at the same time the more chaos you
09:09 - create the more attention you attract
09:10 - this is an XOM leg so you've got a grid
09:12 - based turn-based strategy you can
09:14 - recruit andite operatives to build up
09:16 - your squad make sure to make every shot
09:17 - count take cover and flank your enemies
09:20 - the game also has many features that
09:21 - build upon this genre for example you
09:23 - have more action points to take more
09:25 - complex actions you have more options
09:27 - for how your OverWatch activates and
09:28 - more comp Lex levels with verticality
09:31 - with many flanking positions the time is
09:32 - constantly counting down towards dday
09:34 - it's up to you to choose your missions
09:36 - wisely and help the Allies windar it's
09:38 - been quite some time since I played the
09:39 - turn-based strategy game so I very much
09:41 - want to find the time to give this one a
09:42 - try it is out now with 200 very positive
09:45 - views all right so that's 10 awesome new
09:46 - games made with Y launch in March 24 I
09:49 - hope this list help to you see how the Y
09:50 - engine is capable of building anything
09:52 - the limits are really just your own
09:53 - skills and Imagination and don't forget
09:55 - to check out the spring sale if you need
09:57 - anything then now is the best time to
09:58 - get it

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod M and here let's check out the top new games made with unity launch in March 24 this was an interesting month there were maybe 30 or 40 games that I found really interesting but actually a surprisingly amount of them had some issues and had some mixed reviews although even without those it was still really tricky to pick just 10 for this list there were plenty that look very interesting and were well made the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all these games are in impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month quick mention I just released the free intermediate section for my C course so now both the beginner and intermediate sections are free over here on YouTube the advanced section will be coming out in about 1 to two months I hope you'll learn a lot from these free videos or get the premium version which includes a bunch of awesome bonuses like interactive exercise help you learn by doing and if you need any assets then check out the spring sell on the accur whether you need visual sounds effects tools you can find pretty much anything to help you make your own games I covered some of my favorites that I think can really help you in the last video and check out the Flash Deals page which shows what assets are going to be 70% off in the future check it out to the links in the description all right so starting off at number 10 with a very silly very frustrating game titled a difficult game about climbing you've probably already heard about this one it's been a huge hit with all kinds of streamers and it's made by YouTuber Ponty pants who also made punch a bunch this is a game very much like getting over it and other rage games like that one controls are very tight but the map is extremely difficult if you you fail you drop down to almost the beginning with only a handful of checkpoints along the way you control the hands of the character just move and grab either the left hand or the right hand and then it's all about using momentum to fling yourself from position to position as you try to climb higher and higher there's lots of Hazards like slippery walls and falling water that won't push you down as well as some areas that really just require a leap of faith now personally I'm not really a fan of this genre I don't enjoy feeling frustrating but if you are into these types of games and this is an extremely wellmade one like I said this one is already a huge hit it's got over 2,000 very positive reviews which means that has sold almost 100,000 copies which is an insane amount if that game is too frustrating and instead you want something super chill here is summerhouse it's a relaxing house building game there are no rules no game over screens you just load up a very calming scene like for example in front of a lake and then start building your dream home Brick by Brick you place the walls place the windows then put down some stairs unlock hidden characters and really just enjoy yourself there's no win or lose condition this is really just game meant for relaxing if you're into games like townscaper or DF romantic then you'll probably love this one it seems a lot of people are looking for a relaxing game to play this one already has over a, overwhelmingly positive views at 96% positive that's really awesome super high next up here we have a game all about chaos called Maniac it looks like a really nice mix between the GTA 1 and meter coupled with the game posel in theory it's a simple game with some shooting driving and some Rog light upgrades but in reality it's extremely well made the game looks really great great in motion both in terms of visuals with some really gorgeous natural lighting but also in terms of physics and effects with lots of objects and plenty of particles flying all over the place I wonder if this game is made using dots the amount of objects on screen is really quite impressive you've got lots of weapons lots of vehicles there are six unique characters with skills a large open world and even has a map editor you've got all of that and the goal is to

only happens if your execution is absolutely Flawless which is definitely not easy to achieve this game is indeed finding quite a lot of success it already has over 500 very positive views so probably over 20,000 copies sold in just 3 days next up for a citybuilder exploration game here is buar funer Chronicles it's a very unique Builder game the world is very much nonstandard with lots of

Heroes definitely check that out up next here's an interesting one titled The Brew Barons this one is a flying and beer crafting management game a very unique very strange mix there are apparently some pirates in this world and those pirates have boats and planes and they want to control the supply of beer so your job is to essentially take them out you do some combat to take out all the

negative that reviews mention is just how the plane feels too heavy which maybe is intentional since these are really not fire planes and then at number one for my personal pick of the month if you're into some turnbased strategy set in World War II then here is classified France 44 this is a mix of Commandos which was a game that I love playing as a kid mixed with XCOM which is another game that I
