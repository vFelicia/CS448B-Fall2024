00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - min this video I'm going to give you
00:03 - five options so price you're any game
00:04 - let's begin
00:08 - so as you're making your game you will
00:10 - eventually have to decide how much to
00:12 - charge this can be a tricky thing to
00:14 - figure out so here are five tiers you
00:16 - can look into these tiers that are based
00:19 - on my experience as a PC game developer
00:21 - so they applied to selling your game on
00:23 - Steam or a console and aren't very
00:25 - applicable for mobile games number one
00:27 - free if you're just getting started then
00:29 - chances are your first game will not be
00:31 - very good experience is very important
00:33 - when making games so with your very
00:35 - first game which you should really value
00:37 - most of all is feedback look at it as a
00:39 - learning experience to improve your
00:41 - skills as a game developer so you can
00:43 - later start charging an actual price if
00:45 - you launch on Steam you won't get a
00:47 - bunch of people trying out your game and
00:49 - hopefully giving their feedback as user
00:51 - reviews try to analyze all the reviews
00:53 - to figure out what you did right and
00:55 - what could have been done better since
00:57 - it's free it means players will be more
00:59 - forgiving when giving their feedback
01:00 - keep that in mind and don't become
01:02 - overly confident if you do end up with a
01:05 - very high review score number two three
01:07 - to five dollars once you start charging
01:09 - everything becomes much more difficult
01:11 - just because it's a cheap price don't
01:13 - assume people will go easy on well some
01:15 - people will say it's great value if the
01:17 - game is good you won't also get comments
01:19 - from people saying it really should be
01:21 - free and on the free tier you don't need
01:23 - much to convince some people to give it
01:25 - a shot but in here even though it's
01:27 - cheap you still need a compelling game
01:29 - it needs to be unique enough to convince
01:32 - people to put down even if it's a very
01:33 - small amount so if you just make a basic
01:36 - loan or a simple platformer you won't
01:38 - find much success even if it is so cheap
01:41 - this is the perfect price point for
01:43 - experimentation since people won't be
01:45 - forgiving on the total amount of content
01:47 - what you do have in the game has to be
01:49 - good but you don't need to make dozens
01:51 - of hours of content so use this price
01:53 - point to try out mechanics that you
01:55 - would like to later use in a larger game
01:57 - number three ten to fifteen dollars at
02:00 - this price point it's supposed to be a
02:01 - good indie game you're competing with
02:03 - games like terraria or FTL which are ten
02:06 - dollars in here people expect a quality
02:09 - experience with at least ten hours worth
02:11 - of content so your game should be
02:13 - compelling enough to stack up against
02:15 - $10 competitors while offering something
02:17 - unique so it should be polished and
02:19 - mostly
02:19 - bug free all the menus should be clear
02:22 - and animated while the characters well
02:24 - designed an easy to control and the
02:25 - story or core mechanics extremely solid
02:27 - at this price point you also need a
02:30 - clear marketing strategy the three to
02:32 - five dollar price point lends itself to
02:34 - impulse purchases but in here that no
02:36 - longer happens you need to know your
02:38 - audience and set up your store page to
02:40 - convince people the game is worth the
02:41 - cost the good news is that this price
02:44 - point is perfect for a solo or small
02:46 - team if your game is good and you market
02:48 - it correctly you will be able to make
02:50 - enough money to pay for the cost of the
02:51 - game number four twenty plus dollars
02:54 - this is reserved for top tier indie
02:57 - games games at this level are usually
02:59 - made by teams and contain dozens or
03:01 - hundreds of hours of extremely good
03:03 - content in here you have games like
03:05 - super hot invisible ink the Banner Saga
03:08 - transistor and so on players expect the
03:11 - kind of quality that gets reviewed on
03:12 - sites like IGN your trailer should
03:15 - clearly display good production values
03:17 - it should have great art direction a lot
03:19 - of content and a very compelling concept
03:21 - marketing also has to be a thing you
03:24 - need people to hear about your game
03:25 - outside of Steam so games in this tier
03:27 - normally have adverts on sites like Rock
03:30 - Paper Shotgun number five free with
03:32 - microtransactions I'm adding this one
03:34 - last since it's extremely difficult to
03:36 - pause this is more of a valid price
03:39 - point for mobile games rather than steam
03:40 - it requires very careful balancing and
03:43 - mountains of players most people won't
03:45 - buy our micro transactions so you need
03:47 - to balance making the game great for the
03:49 - majority of free players but also
03:51 - offering compelling content for the
03:53 - paying players again this is very tricky
03:55 - to follow up correctly so I wouldn't
03:57 - recommend it and certainly not if you're
03:59 - making a game to release on Steam so
04:01 - there you have it five tiers to price
04:03 - your indie game as always these are just
04:05 - guidelines of what players expect at
04:07 - different price points there's no rule
04:09 - saying you can price your first game at
04:11 - $20 but you're unlikely to succeed also
04:14 - these guidelines depend on how unique
04:16 - your game is and in what January it's
04:18 - competing it in a proper general like
04:20 - platformers there won't be a lot of
04:22 - competition charging very little on the
04:24 - other hand if you target a very unique
04:26 - and very specific niche you can probably
04:28 - get away with charging more since
04:30 - there's my
04:30 - options if you have any questions post
04:33 - them in the comments and I'll do my best
04:34 - answer them subscribe for more videos
04:36 - and I'll see you next time
