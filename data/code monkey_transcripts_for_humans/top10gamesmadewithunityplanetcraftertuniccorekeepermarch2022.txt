01:05 - with one that's been very highly
01:07 - anticipated for a long time here is
01:08 - tunic it's a zelda-like action
01:11 - exploration game i love the visuals on
01:13 - this one very inviting creates a really
01:16 - nice sense of wonder
01:17 - you explore this massive world with tons
01:19 - of variation there's lots of enemies to
01:21 - fight items to collect and puzzles to
01:23 - solve

01:26 - and it's already had almost 2 000 very
01:27 - positive reviews
01:29 - there was also a session during unity's
01:31 - gdc where the developer came out and
01:33 - showed a bunch of interesting tricks
01:34 - that the game uses definitely go watch
01:36 - that on unity's twitch channel if you
01:38 - want to see some behind the scenes on
01:40 - this game personally i really loved
01:42 - watching the trick for how they used by
01:44 - making meshes as a path and then using
01:46 - some scrolling textures for their
01:48 - awesome particle effects up next one
01:50 - that i've been watching on twitter for
01:51 - quite a long time instruments of
01:53 - destruction
01:54 - this one is pretty much the definition
01:56 - of a very giftable game every clip from
01:58 - this looks excellent
01:59 - it's got very satisfying destruction
02:01 - with tons of debris lots of effects
02:03 - including some nice tilt shift effect
02:06 - the game itself is a vehicle sandbox
02:08 - game it's all about building your
02:09 - vehicle to destroy all kinds of
02:11 - buildings everything with some really
02:13 - awesome physics
02:14 - you have tons of parts to choose from
02:16 - you set up what input activates what so
02:19 - the vehicle construction system is
02:20 - really complex you build out your
02:22 - vehicle and then load the map and take
02:24 - everything down
02:25 - the scale infidelity of the destruction
02:27 - is really impressive i tried to find out
02:29 - if this one is using dots in any way but
02:31 - i couldn't find anything either way the
02:33 - trailer looks really awesome so if you
02:35 - like some v-con construction and
02:37 - destruction then check this out up next
02:39 - a game that is selling a massive amount
02:41 - of copies its core keeper already over 6
02:44 - 000 very positive reviews that is an
02:46 - insane amount
02:48 - the game is an adventure crafting mining
02:50 - game there's a large world to explore
02:52 - with tons of resources together and lots
02:54 - of items to craft it's got a really nice
02:56 - art sound looks very old school some
02:58 - awesome pixel art the game is
03:00 - multiplayer so that's certainly a reason
03:01 - for its massive success build your home
03:03 - with friends then go out and explore
03:05 - together fighting all kinds of enemies
03:07 - from some simple slimes to some huge
03:09 - boss fights
03:10 - looks like a game that is fun solo and
03:12 - excellent with friends and then here's a
03:14 - really fun one wobble dogs it's a very
03:17 - descriptive name you control some
03:19 - dog-like animals that are certainly very
03:21 - wobbly the game is all about breeding
03:24 - growing and mutating your weapon dogs
03:26 - each weapon dog has their own unique
03:28 - personality some just want to sleep
03:29 - while some are hyperactive you build out
03:32 - their house give them things to do and
03:34 - keep them nice and healthy this one is
03:36 - actually fully out now graduating from
03:38 - early access it has 1500 overwhelmingly
03:41 - positive reviews so if you're looking
03:43 - for a nice fun stress-free pet simulator
03:46 - then definitely give it a try if instead
03:48 - you want a home building game but for
03:50 - humans then look at no place like home
03:52 - basically humanity trashed the earth and
03:54 - left for mars you're one of the few that
03:56 - remain behind and it's up to you to
03:58 - explore the world clean the mountains of
04:00 - trash and rebuild a thriving village
04:02 - with a healthy environment
04:04 - for me i love cleaning mechanics so
04:06 - starting with a really messed up planet
04:08 - and cleaning it all up is immediately
04:09 - appealing to me also features the usual
04:12 - crafting mechanics you expect so you can
04:14 - create buildings you can farm for food
04:16 - do some cooking you can recycle a bunch
04:18 - of old materials and unlock upgrades in
04:21 - a tech tree and so on combining worm
04:23 - cleaning with worm building seems like a
04:25 - great combo and lots of people agree
04:27 - this one has also just launched out of
04:29 - early access with already over 2 000
04:32 - very positive reviews
04:33 - and despite being at 1.0 they're
04:35 - continuing to work on the game with
04:37 - several content updates planned then
04:39 - let's check out some vr with ifetch
04:41 - rocks on the one hand it's also a very
04:43 - descriptive name it's a game about
04:45 - harvesting resources
04:47 - however i feel the name also does a the
04:49 - service of the game what caught my eye
04:51 - right away were the interesting machines
04:52 - that you can build you have all kinds of
04:55 - components and tons of cables to connect
04:56 - them it's extremely customizable you can
04:59 - place the controls wherever you want and
05:01 - if you change your mind just grab them
05:02 - again and place them elsewhere you have
05:05 - red cables for power and green cables
05:07 - for data connect them all to make sure
05:09 - the components have the power and react
05:10 - to your input and then of course after
05:13 - setting up your ship it's time to find
05:14 - gather some resources the concept looks
05:16 - really interesting and has just landed
05:18 - in early access i'm curious to check it
05:20 - out a year from now to see just how much
05:22 - they expend upon this base idea
05:24 - up next a pretty unique one airborne
05:26 - kingdom it's half city welder half
05:29 - exploration game you build a floating
05:31 - metropolis aid the people down below and
05:33 - fly off on a quest
05:35 - build your own ship from scratch with
05:36 - tons of tools at your disposal
05:38 - features lots of customization to really
05:40 - make your airborne kingdom exactly your
05:42 - own
05:43 - also features a creative mode if all you
05:45 - want to do is just build and relax
05:47 - it's got lots of positive press missions
05:49 - and tons of awards definitely a unique
05:51 - take on the tycoon genre then a game
05:53 - that combines two really great games
05:55 - this means warp
05:57 - it has the chaotic co-op tasks from
05:59 - overcooked coupled with some nice
06:01 - strategy gameplay like fdl that sounds
06:04 - like a great combo co-op is either on
06:06 - local or online however you can also
06:08 - play solo
06:10 - there's tons of randomization so every
06:12 - run is unique
06:13 - and their roadmap is also pretty nicely
06:15 - detailed however one really interesting
06:17 - thing about this one is when compared to
06:19 - the other multiplayer game that i
06:21 - mentioned a while ago compared to core
06:22 - keeper both of them look great both have
06:25 - a heavy emphasis on multiplayer and yet
06:28 - one has over six thousand reviews while
06:30 - the other one has just under a hundred
06:32 - it really goes to show how when you
06:34 - focus on multiplayer either you hit it
06:36 - massively or not at all but this game
06:38 - doesn't look interesting and looks well
06:40 - made it's only now launching in early
06:42 - access so i hope they managed to grow an
06:44 - audience and have a successful phone
06:46 - launch and up next if you're looking for
06:48 - a really stylish action platformer here
06:50 - is have a nice death visually it looks
06:52 - excellent i really like the style it's a
06:55 - 2d action roguelike lots of moves jumps
06:57 - and attacks the game has a fun story you
07:00 - play as a overworked death and all your
07:02 - employees are basically slacking off so
07:04 - it's up to you to get them back to work
07:06 - all the art is hand drawn and really
07:08 - gives it an excellent look very flowing
07:10 - very satisfying animations as with many
07:13 - roguelikes you also have tons of weapons
07:15 - and upgrades at your disposal
07:17 - and every upgrade for you also makes
07:19 - your enemies become stronger in some way
07:21 - looks pretty fun and already has tons of
07:23 - positive reviews and over here at number
07:25 - one for my personal pick of the month is
07:27 - planet crafter i remember seeing the
07:29 - free prologue for this one quite a while
07:31 - ago and it seems to be doing very well
07:33 - at launch
07:34 - it's only been out for five days by the
07:36 - time that i'm writing this and already
07:38 - has 1500 reviews at 95 positive
07:41 - the game is an open world survival
07:43 - crafting game with a nice emphasis on
07:46 - terraforming at a planetary scale
07:48 - so you arrive at this planet it's all
07:50 - very desolate and inhospitable your goal
07:53 - is pretty much to make it livable for
07:55 - humans so start gathering some resources
07:58 - start by building some machines create
07:59 - some oxygen then create the conditions
08:02 - to build an atmosphere and watch as the
08:04 - planet changes due to your actions
08:06 - if you do things well then by the end
08:08 - you will have a vibrant lush healthy
08:10 - world to call home looking at the
08:12 - trailer i really love the contrast
08:13 - between the unhealthy red starring
08:15 - planet and the gorgeous lush green
08:17 - planet at the end it's really a great
08:19 - way of demonstrating player progression
08:21 - in a very visual way alright so that's
08:24 - 10 awesome new games made with dmt and
