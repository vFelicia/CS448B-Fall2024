00:19 - pretty much everything is at 50 off in
00:22 - those 8 years they've made so many packs
00:23 - on so many themes you can build an
00:25 - infinite amount of unique games with all

00:29 - fun video the last time there was a sale
00:30 - like this
00:31 - i made a rts game a racing game and a
00:34 - farming game using a bunch of really
00:35 - interesting packs the packs that i used
00:37 - in that video those are all currently
00:38 - discounted i'm a big fan of medieval
00:40 - games so i've used the fantasy kingdom
00:42 - pack in many videos like for example the
00:44 - backstab video it's one of the biggest
00:46 - packs with over 2000 prefabs all ready
00:48 - to be used you have tons of environment
00:50 - and building parts all of them modular
00:52 - so you can build any castle you want and
00:54 - a massive amount of characters to
00:55 - populate your world also a really
00:57 - awesome certain medieval one that came
00:59 - out recently is the ancient empire's
01:00 - pack now this one just came out last
01:02 - month so it isn't discount but i love
01:04 - how this one looks if you want something
01:06 - small and focused then the heist pack is
01:07 - another one i've used many times really
01:10 - great scene with the bank also a bunch
01:11 - of characters with masks lots of bank
01:13 - props like money vault and more and this
01:16 - one is actually pretty cheap also
01:18 - medieval you have the fantasy characters
01:20 - pack i use this one in the character
01:22 - customization video this pack is perfect
01:24 - for exactly that just with this you can
01:26 - build an infinite amount of unique
01:27 - characters they also have some packs in
01:30 - a different style their simple series
01:32 - it's the sound that they started out
01:33 - with it's much more low poly more cube
01:35 - shapes
01:36 - so it's a pretty nice style and they're
01:38 - all also discount if you're making a
01:40 - racing game you have the street racer
01:42 - pack racing isn't the genre that i have
01:44 - much experience developing but every
01:45 - time i look at this pack it makes me
01:47 - want to build something features tons of
01:49 - cars tracks lots of pieces and props
01:51 - it's really nice
01:52 - for something more standard you have the
01:54 - military pack so this would be perfect
01:56 - if you're making a game inspired by call
01:58 - of duty or battlefield
01:59 - for something smaller you have the
02:01 - battleground pack which i've also used
02:03 - many times before it's what i use in my
02:05 - third person shooter video so this one
02:07 - is another great pack and it's also
02:09 - pretty cheap if you're making some kind
02:10 - of management tycoon game you have the
02:12 - shops pack i'm actually using this pack
02:14 - for a video that i'm currently editing
02:16 - it's all about how to pick up and drop
02:17 - items so this pack was perfect for it it
02:20 - has tons of shops with a mountain of
02:21 - props all of them really nice if you
02:23 - want to make a farming game you have the
02:25 - farm pack or for an outside environment

02:29 - biggest ones is the sapphire worlds i
