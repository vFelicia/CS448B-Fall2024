00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and last week I made a video doing a
00:04 - quick recap of unity's GDC world map
00:06 - Tonk which covered what is coming to the
00:08 - engine in the near future the response
00:10 - to the roadmap was somewhat mixed some
00:11 - positive comments some negative or just
00:13 - some disappointed comments so in this
00:15 - video let me tell you my thoughts on
00:16 - this topic and ask you what do you want
00:18 - to see from Unity one thing that is very
00:20 - clear to me in all of the events that
00:22 - UND has invited me to and also they've
00:24 - emphasized in the beginning of the
00:25 - roadmap is how they're always looking
00:27 - for feedback so make sure you write a
00:29 - comment with whatever you want them to
00:31 - do I'm sure someone from Unity won't be
00:32 - reading the comments in this video and
00:34 - also before I share my comments on
00:35 - whether the roadmap is disappointing or
00:37 - not let me quickly talk about what many
00:39 - people mentioned which is a direct
00:40 - comparison with unreal's presentation
00:42 - now on that topic I'm really going to
00:44 - say the same thing that I've only said
00:45 - personally I have never had any interest
00:47 - in the game engine Wars thankfully we
00:49 - don't live in a time where we are very
00:50 - much spawned for choices game developers
00:52 - all the engines are great nowadays Unity
00:54 - is great and real is great Godot is
00:56 - great there's really no wrong answer so
00:58 - pick whatever you want personal only I
01:00 - use Unity because what I started with
01:02 - and I stick with it because I have yet
01:04 - to find a game idea that I could not
01:06 - produce with DNT so until that happens I
01:08 - really have no need or desire to change
01:10 - to a different engine but that does not
01:12 - mean that I have a negative view of
01:13 - unreal or anything I love what unreal is
01:16 - doing and I definitely hope they keep
01:17 - building some awesome stuff again all
01:19 - the engines are great they are really
01:20 - just signals there are plenty of great
01:22 - games made with both engines and also
01:24 - plenty of shovelware the quality of the
01:25 - games that you make is more dependent on
01:27 - your skills as a game developer rather
01:29 - than what engine you use to make it so I
01:30 - just wanted to mention that right from
01:32 - the start use whatever engine you want
01:33 - don't waste your energy getting caught
01:35 - up in meaningless internet Wars with
01:37 - that said here are my thoughts on
01:38 - unreal's presentation and whether I feel
01:40 - that Unity is lacking basically my
01:41 - conclusion is they are targeted at
01:43 - completely different audiences and real
01:45 - stock is more like an E3 showcase more
01:47 - than half of it is dedicated to showing
01:49 - some really awesome looking games being
01:50 - built with the engine whereas Unity
01:52 - stock is very much targeted at
01:54 - developers it is focused on showing tons
01:55 - of tools in every area where the engine
01:57 - is used both are great depending on the
01:59 - target audience and what you expect from
02:01 - it I think in real is excellent at
02:03 - marketing and making the engine seem
02:04 - really exciting watching their
02:06 - presentations is always great fun so I
02:08 - very much enjoy them as a viewer however
02:09 - as a developer as a solo in developer
02:12 - who makes primarily 2D or low poly 3D
02:14 - games for me those exciting features
02:16 - well they look great in a showcase I
02:18 - don't really have much use for them in
02:19 - my day-to-day work for example on nanite
02:21 - which several people mentioned in the
02:23 - comments I agree that it's extremely
02:24 - impressive Tech being able to just load
02:26 - a super high poly mesh directly in your
02:28 - game is a great thing I imagine that
02:30 - saves tons of time in big studios or in
02:32 - movie production but personally I use
02:34 - low poly 3D meshes I don't really have
02:36 - an army of artists working for me
02:38 - building some super high poly meshes
02:40 - with tons of maps so for me I love
02:42 - looking at the nanite demos I'm always
02:43 - amazed at how good it looks but I have
02:45 - no use for it in my actual games another
02:48 - big one that people always mention is
02:49 - metahuman again I agree it's extremely
02:52 - impressive extremely realistic humans
02:54 - that look very excellent and the Face
02:56 - animation tag they showcase is
02:57 - definitely Beyond excellent just with
02:59 - the phone you can get some high quality
03:00 - facial animation this is the kind of
03:02 - thing that previously would have taken
03:03 - months and hundreds of thousands of
03:05 - dollars so this is definitely an
03:06 - excellent tool but again for me
03:08 - personally the types of games that I
03:09 - make do not require this kind of super
03:11 - high fidelity facial capture so I have
03:13 - no use for it as developer one thing
03:15 - that I absolutely do wish that Unity had
03:17 - is something similar to Lumen this is
03:19 - unreal's global illumination system it
03:21 - allows you to let any scene with some
03:23 - really accurate really gorgeous looking
03:25 - lighting I believe they've only shown it
03:27 - being used in some realistic scenes but
03:28 - I'm sure it also looks great in some
03:30 - more satellite scenes as well Unity is
03:32 - currently working on a global
03:33 - illumination tool it is based on their
03:35 - adaptive Pros volume although the only
03:37 - very very briefly mentioned it on their
03:39 - roadmap and there's no timeline so there
03:41 - is definitely one tool that unreal has
03:43 - that I wish Unity hand that would be
03:45 - useful to me as a solo Indie Dev and the
03:47 - procedural tunnel they showcase also
03:49 - seems very interesting although again
03:50 - makes me wonder would that work with a
03:52 - more stylized Arsenal or not only at the
03:54 - parameters in the video they seem very
03:55 - specific to this hyper realistic style
03:57 - some parameters are called trees Fallen
03:59 - trees and Bank and plants and while I
04:01 - kind of wish Unity had a built-in tool
04:03 - to do something like this I know there
04:05 - are plenty of tools on the SSR that do
04:06 - it exactly so basically unreal's talk
04:08 - was all really flashy which is excellent
04:10 - for getting people excited over a half
04:12 - of their talk was dedicated to
04:13 - showcasing some awesome gorgeous looking
04:15 - games that are being built with the
04:16 - engine so it's almost like an E3 game
04:18 - showcase rather than a roadmap Tonk
04:20 - whereas unity's was much more reserved
04:22 - much less flashy and much more focused
04:24 - on being targeted towards developers
04:25 - rather than Gamers which personally that
04:27 - is the kind of presentation that I
04:28 - prefer for a world map tone so as a
04:31 - viewer wanting to watch something fun I
04:32 - very much enjoyed unreal's presentation
04:34 - but as a developer I'm looking for what
04:36 - Tunes I can actually use in my games I
04:38 - much prefer ENT stock I've already used
04:40 - the recently released netco for game
04:41 - objects to make a nice multiplayer game
04:43 - and I definitely want to explore it some
04:45 - more I'm very much looking forward to
04:46 - their user generated content tool I
04:48 - truly think this one won't be an
04:49 - excellent tool that won't be very useful
04:51 - to many developers their upcoming
04:53 - friends who also seems very useful as is
04:55 - pretty much everything in the entire ugs
04:57 - still stack and I'm obviously very much
04:58 - looking forward to dots and
04:59 - experimenting with some games on a
05:01 - completely different scale So based on
05:03 - this my question to the people who post
05:04 - about those in real tools like nanite my
05:07 - question is do you actually have a use
05:08 - case for it do you actually have a team
05:10 - of artists behind you to build the
05:12 - assets to really take advantage of that
05:13 - tool or do you just want it just because
05:15 - say shiny new thing that's a genuine
05:17 - question I assume that most of the
05:19 - audience on this channel are small or
05:21 - solo Indie devs just like me so for most
05:23 - people watching this I don't think there
05:24 - is a use case for these films but I
05:26 - could be wrong so let me know also some
05:28 - people seem to be disappointed that UNT
05:30 - didn't showcase too much but personally
05:32 - I don't get disappointed with that
05:33 - because I understand why they do it
05:34 - previously everyone was angry at them
05:36 - because they were very quick to announce
05:38 - things which would then take years to
05:39 - come to fruition the obvious example is
05:41 - dots which was announced all the way
05:43 - back in 2018 and is only now in 2023
05:46 - finally reaching 1.0 so they took that
05:48 - feedback to heart and nowadays they only
05:50 - showcase things that are either already
05:51 - out or only a few months away that means
05:53 - there aren't many flashy new
05:55 - announcements in these roadmaps but it
05:56 - also means there's less people
05:57 - constantly complaining that the engine
05:58 - is permanently in preview personally I
06:00 - would like to see some more interesting
06:02 - things even if they are very far out but
06:04 - I fully understand why they no longer do
06:05 - it so now I'm very happy with the
06:07 - currency of unity and these small
06:09 - incremental improvements that happen
06:10 - month after month so I was happy with
06:12 - what I saw with the roadmap Tonk I can
06:14 - already build any game that I can
06:15 - imagine so even if the engine suddenly
06:17 - stopped getting new features and updates
06:19 - I would still be happy I remember back
06:21 - in 2012 when I wanted to transition from
06:23 - flash to making PC games back then when
06:25 - I was looking for what game engine to
06:27 - use I only had two requirements one can
06:29 - I draw something on screen and two can I
06:31 - apply some logic to it those were really
06:33 - my own requirements I knew that as long
06:35 - as I could do those two things then I
06:37 - could build anything but that's really
06:38 - just my opinion I know some people want
06:40 - an engine to have tons and tons of
06:42 - built-in tools so my question to you is
06:44 - what do you want Unity to do if you want
06:46 - to disappoint with roadmap which would
06:48 - you want it to contain what tools and
06:49 - features would be helpful to you in the
06:51 - game that you are building right now
06:52 - like I said my experience Unity is
06:54 - always generally looking for feedback so
06:56 - I'm sure someone won't be reading your
06:57 - comments alright hope that's useful
06:59 - check out these videos to learn some
07:01 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
07:03 - supporters for making these videos
07:04 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
07:06 - see you next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and last week I made a video doing a quick recap of unity's GDC world map Tonk which covered what is coming to the engine in the near future the response to the roadmap was somewhat mixed some positive comments some negative or just some disappointed comments so in this video let me tell you my thoughts on this topic and ask you what do you want to see from Unity one thing that is very clear to me in all of the events that UND has invited me to and also they've emphasized in the beginning of the roadmap is how they're always looking for feedback so make

dedicated to showing some really awesome looking games being built with the engine whereas Unity stock is very much targeted at developers it is focused on showing tons of tools in every area where the engine is used both are great depending on the target audience and what you expect from it I think in real is excellent at marketing and making the engine seem really exciting watching their presentations is always great fun so I very much enjoy them as a viewer however as a developer as a solo in developer who makes primarily 2D or low poly 3D games for me those exciting features well they look great in a showcase I don't really have much use for them in my daytoday work for example on nanite which several people mentioned in the comments I agree that it's extremely impressive Tech being able to just load a super high poly mesh directly in your game is a great thing I imagine that saves tons of time in big studios or in movie production but personally I use low poly 3D meshes I
