00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's learn all about unity
00:04 - gaming services what it is what tools it
00:06 - contains and how it can help you make
00:08 - better games this video is sponsored by
00:10 - unity now before i explain it just a
00:12 - quick question how many of you are
00:14 - actually familiar with the unity gaming
00:16 - services name brand
00:17 - let me know in the comments and i also
00:19 - made a poll in the community tab this is
00:21 - the name that unity have been using for
00:23 - its new platform of tools that they
00:24 - launched on last october so i'm curious
00:26 - to know how many of you already know the
00:28 - name unity gaming services and what it
00:30 - represents although even if you don't
00:32 - know this specific name you certainly
00:33 - know some of the tools under this brand
00:36 - basically what it is is a collection
00:37 - with tons of tools to help you build
00:39 - operate and grow your games all of these
00:41 - tools are extremely scalable and they've
00:43 - already been validated in real world use
00:45 - by games like phoneguys apex legends
00:48 - they've been used by valrantomongas
00:50 - v-rising and tons more and before you
00:52 - get concerned like i've seen on some
00:54 - comments on other videos related to this
00:56 - topic all of these tools are either
00:58 - completely free or they have very
00:59 - generous free tiers
01:01 - if you're new developer like i see most
01:03 - of my audiences then the three tiers are
01:05 - unlikely more than enough for any game
01:06 - you want to make and if you just so
01:08 - happen to be unlucky and your game is a
01:10 - monumental hit then at that point the
01:12 - prices are more than worth it i just
01:13 - wanted to quickly point that out because
01:15 - the official video definitely looks a
01:17 - bit too marketing heavy which can
01:18 - certainly make you question whether this
01:20 - is a good thing or whether they're just
01:22 - trying to sell you something but it
01:23 - really is a great set of tools that are
01:25 - likely to be completely free for you but
01:27 - before we look at pricing let's first
01:29 - look at all the tools and see what they
01:30 - do and how they can help you with your
01:32 - own games
01:33 - this video actually end up pretty long
01:34 - since there are so many interesting
01:36 - tools to explain definitely do watch the
01:38 - whole thing maybe one of these is
01:39 - exactly what you need for your current
01:41 - game there's a really nice page where
01:43 - you can find all the tools and what they
01:44 - all do and the reason why unity
01:46 - sponsored this video right now is
01:48 - because pretty much all the tools that
01:50 - we're going to see all of them have just
01:51 - left beta and they're fully released the
01:53 - main one that is still in beta is the
01:55 - netcode for game objects this is unity's
01:58 - official networking library which it
02:00 - have been building for quite a while
02:02 - it's been in preview 1.0 for quite some
02:04 - time so i would guess it won't be fully
02:05 - released sometime later this year but
02:08 - other than that pretty much everything
02:09 - is done and fully released out of beta
02:11 - so let's look at all of these tools and
02:13 - how they can help you make better games
02:14 - faster
02:15 - the main page divides it into three core
02:17 - pillars first of all you have to also
02:19 - build your game foundation you can add
02:21 - multiplayer setup accounts push updates
02:23 - and so on then you can engage your
02:25 - players by using tools to tweak your
02:27 - game to perfection and connecting them
02:29 - together with either voice or text
02:31 - and finally you can grow your game and
02:33 - acquire new players to drive your
02:34 - revenue this is a really wide range of
02:36 - tools so which ones are useful is going
02:38 - to depend on what game you're making
02:40 - here let's do a quick overview of each
02:42 - tool what it does and how it can help
02:43 - you then perhaps in the future i'll dive
02:45 - deeper into each one of them there's
02:47 - also time steps in the video if you want
02:48 - to skip ahead to a particular tool okay
02:51 - so starting off over here with the
02:52 - multiplayer tools on this page the first
02:54 - thing that you see is a bunch of really
02:56 - interesting case studies on several
02:57 - games and how they use these to also
02:59 - great success you probably recognize
03:01 - apex legends and how they're using one
03:03 - of these tools to host their servers
03:05 - so if we scroll down here it is all
03:07 - these multiplayer tools let's start off
03:09 - with the one that is probably most
03:10 - useful to indie devs over here is relay
03:12 - this is a tool for helping you enable
03:14 - multiplayer in your games without having
03:16 - to use custom dedicated servers
03:18 - it basically helps you do peer-to-peer
03:20 - connections
03:21 - if you've ever tried making a
03:22 - multiplayer game and you run into issues
03:24 - related with nat and firewalls then this
03:26 - tool helps solve that
03:28 - this is a super useful tool i remember
03:30 - when i experimented making multiplayer
03:32 - for my game survivor squad gauntlets i
03:34 - tried handling it all myself but it was
03:36 - nearly impossible to deal with the net
03:38 - and all the firewalls that exist
03:40 - but when i implemented the old unit
03:42 - relay service it all worked perfectly so
03:44 - in terms of easily implementing
03:45 - multiplayer this is only super useful
03:47 - and as you can see it integrates easily
03:48 - with lobby netcode for game objects and
03:50 - even with mirror
03:52 - in terms of pricing if we scroll down
03:54 - and look at it over here on the relay
03:57 - you can see the first 50 ccu's are
03:59 - clearly free for each month just in case
04:01 - you don't know ccus are concurrent
04:03 - connected users meaning you can have 50
04:05 - players playing the game at the exact
04:06 - same time and all of it for free now
04:09 - again that's at the same time so that's
04:10 - not 50 players total so as one drops and
04:13 - another one joins the total number of
04:15 - concurrent users stays the same
04:17 - so 50 cc use actually quite a lot
04:20 - and if your game blows up and you get a
04:21 - massive amount of players then it just
04:23 - costs an additional 16 cents per
04:25 - additional ccu
04:26 - next thing to worry about is bandwidth
04:27 - which again is also pretty generous you
04:29 - have three gigabytes per user up to 150
04:32 - total
04:33 - that's a massive amount for a
04:34 - multiplayer game since multiplayer data
04:36 - packets are usually pretty tiny the next
04:39 - multiplayer tool we can look at is over
04:40 - here on lobby this one lets you create
04:43 - public and private lobbies for all your
04:44 - games so it's kind of like a master
04:46 - server to help you connect players to
04:48 - one another without having to deal with
04:49 - direct ips
04:50 - again for my own personal experience
04:52 - when i worked on some multiplayer i had
04:54 - to build my own master server from
04:56 - scratch doing that was a ton of work and
04:58 - didn't really work very well so an easy
05:00 - to use tool like this one is absolutely
05:02 - excellent and again if we scroll down we
05:04 - can see that all of these tools are made
05:05 - to easily work with one another
05:07 - so you can use lobby to create a private
05:09 - lobby for all of your friends to join
05:11 - then you can connect them all together
05:13 - with relay and possibly manage all of
05:15 - the data packets using netcode for game
05:17 - objects for handling the game data so
05:19 - all these tools are really meant to
05:20 - easily work with one another pricing for
05:23 - lobby is again very generous this is
05:25 - just some lobby so i assume data sizes
05:27 - are really tiny so 10 gigabytes for free
05:30 - on a per region basis this one really
05:32 - sounds like a ton the next multiplayer
05:34 - tool that we can see over here is
05:36 - multiply this is the one that is used by
05:38 - apex legends so it has been thoroughly
05:40 - battle-tested what it is is a cloud
05:42 - infrastructure service for handling all
05:44 - of your game server hosting so as your
05:46 - game grows and shrinks it automatically
05:48 - adds or removes service from the pool
05:50 - if he can support a massive game like
05:52 - apex legends going from zero to 50
05:54 - million players in under 24 days if it
05:57 - can handle that then it won't have no
05:58 - issues supporting any game this one is a
06:01 - pretty serious tool for some very
06:02 - high-end games
06:04 - so for this one in order to get started
06:05 - you contact unity so it seems like for
06:08 - most indie games you're going to be just
06:09 - fine using the relay if you have a
06:11 - really serious game where you expect a
06:13 - really massive release that's where
06:14 - multiplayer takes over and helps you set
06:16 - up dedicated game servers
06:18 - and the next tool which works in
06:19 - combination with multiplayer is
06:21 - matchmaker this one like the name
06:23 - implies handles matchmaking
06:25 - so you define all the rules all the
06:27 - logic for handling your matchmaking like
06:29 - for example the player's skill level
06:30 - what specific gear they're using maybe
06:32 - the player character and level and so on
06:35 - it's up to you to define all of those
06:36 - rules and then matchmaker tries to find
06:38 - a match for players using those search
06:40 - settings again this is another
06:41 - pre-series tool for some pretty high-end
06:43 - multiplayer games so if this one looks
06:45 - useful then contact unity and the final
06:48 - tool in this section is over here the
06:49 - netcode for game objects like i said
06:51 - this one is the one that is still in
06:52 - beta this is unity's official networking
06:55 - library and it's currently in active
06:56 - development there's already a really
06:58 - nice simple project that you can
07:00 - download to see how it works i'm
07:01 - definitely going to be covering this
07:03 - tool with lots of videos when it comes
07:04 - out of beta so these are the various
07:06 - multiplayer tools as you can see tons of
07:08 - things to help you make multiple games
07:10 - you can build your game with netcode for
07:12 - game objects then you can use lobby to
07:14 - create lobbies to help your players find
07:16 - one another you can use relay to connect
07:18 - them all together regardless of firewall
07:20 - or net then if your game is massive you
07:22 - can host dedicated game servers with
07:24 - multiplayer and you can match players
07:26 - together using matchmaker so tons of
07:28 - tools really to help you make
07:29 - multiplayer games now scrolling down the
07:31 - next section this one is all about
07:33 - accounts
07:34 - first of all you have cloud save like
07:36 - name implies this one handles cloud
07:37 - saving normally for my own games i use
07:40 - teams cloud save but the obvious
07:41 - downside of that is that it only works
07:43 - on seam whereas this service works on
07:45 - any platform anywhere you can save
07:47 - whatever that you want so it can be user
07:49 - settings maybe some playtime statistics
07:51 - maybe you want to save the player
07:53 - progression so you can easily implement
07:54 - cross-platform progression
07:56 - since it works across multiple devices
07:58 - you can let players play on their pc
08:00 - then load up the same game on mobile and
08:02 - continue from there for pricing again
08:04 - the free tier is really generous
08:06 - you have five gigabytes of data you can
08:08 - sort per month that's a massive amount
08:11 - usually save files from my games are
08:12 - between just one or a hundred kilobytes
08:15 - so five gigabytes is essentially
08:17 - infinite you'd probably need hundreds or
08:19 - thousands of players before reaching
08:20 - this level then you have one million
08:23 - rights and reads per month also a huge
08:25 - amount and of course you are the one who
08:26 - decides how often you want to save and
08:28 - load the next tool under accounts is
08:30 - authentication
08:31 - this one works perfectly in combination
08:33 - with cloud save basically you need to
08:35 - know what user owns what saves so this
08:37 - is how you authenticate them and of
08:39 - course you can authenticate your user
08:40 - regardless of whatever platform they're
08:42 - on authentication is one of those things
08:44 - that is always super tricky to handle
08:45 - there are so many potential security
08:47 - issues that can easily pop up and just
08:49 - break your game if you try implementing
08:51 - it yourself so tool like this to easily
08:53 - make that process super easy is really
08:55 - useful it works in combination with
08:57 - lobby and matchmaker so you can invite
08:58 - your friends over
09:00 - and all of the user data saved in the
09:02 - economy tool which we're going to see in
09:03 - a bit all of that is naturally behind
09:05 - authentication so it all stays nice and
09:06 - secure and one huge benefit of this is
09:09 - that it also supports anonymous sign-in
09:11 - so you don't have to annoy your users
09:13 - and force them to create an account with
09:15 - just one click it automatically creates
09:17 - an anonymous user and lets your players
09:19 - use all these tools in terms of pricing
09:21 - there isn't any authentication is always
09:23 - free
09:24 - scrolling down some more we see a bunch
09:25 - of tools on game management
09:28 - the first one is cloud content delivery
09:30 - this one is all about delivering updates
09:32 - to your game and as usual since it's
09:34 - from the cloud it does not require a
09:35 - build update this integrates very easily
09:38 - with the addressable system that's
09:40 - actually one system that i've been
09:41 - meaning to cover you basically define
09:43 - the path to some object some asset or
09:45 - something then with this you can upload
09:47 - those assets to the cloud and the next
09:48 - time the player plays your game they
09:50 - won't see the updated data for example
09:52 - this is perfect for making some limited
09:54 - time events you just upload the event
09:56 - assets then using the next one that
09:57 - we're going to see remote config with
09:59 - that you can start the event so the
10:00 - players see the new limited time assets
10:03 - and then you can end it and this uses a
10:05 - reliable content delivery network so
10:07 - acdn
10:08 - if you don't know what that is it's
10:09 - basically servers spread throughout the
10:11 - entire world so when the player plays
10:12 - your game they can request data from the
10:14 - server closest to them instead of having
10:16 - to go all the way to the other side of
10:17 - the world this one is a really
10:18 - interesting tool definitely something
10:20 - that i want to research along with the
10:21 - addressables that's also another one
10:22 - that i really want to cover
10:24 - and in terms of pricing you can see you
10:26 - have 50 gigabytes for free per month
10:29 - again whether that is a lot or not is
10:30 - going to depend on what kind of data
10:32 - you're delivering
10:33 - if it's some super high-end 8k textures
10:35 - then 50 gigs might not be too much but
10:38 - this is really meant for some quick
10:39 - simple updates if you have a huge update
10:42 - that requires a massive amount of data
10:44 - in that case doing a regular update to
10:45 - the build would be the best approach so
10:47 - if you use this tool correctly then this
10:49 - free tier 50 gigabytes per month is
10:51 - likely way more than enough the next
10:53 - game management tool is over here remote
10:55 - config this is another one that i've
10:57 - been meaning to look at for quite some
10:58 - time it's a pretty simple tool but
11:00 - potentially very useful
11:02 - it's similar to the previous one in that
11:04 - this is data that you can store in the
11:06 - cloud in some server and your players
11:08 - download
11:09 - but rather than assets this one is meant
11:10 - for easily modifying certain parameters
11:13 - so you have a really nice dashboard
11:14 - where you can see all of the parameters
11:16 - that you defined and with a simple click
11:18 - you can just change them so for example
11:20 - if all of your players are having a lot
11:21 - of trouble in level 2 you can define a
11:23 - parameter for the gold reward amount on
11:25 - level 1 and with a simple click you can
11:27 - change it and as usual this works
11:29 - extremely well when combined with many
11:31 - of the other tools previously i
11:32 - mentioned working together with cloud
11:34 - content delivery then you can also make
11:36 - it work correctly with game overrides
11:38 - you can also do some a b testing which
11:40 - we're going to see in a bit so for
11:41 - example one group of players would
11:43 - receive a certain xp for completing a
11:45 - quest another group would get a
11:46 - different amount
11:47 - then you can analyze the data to see
11:49 - which one is working as you intended in
11:51 - terms of pricing for remote config it's
11:53 - always free the next tool is cloud code
11:56 - this is one way to run your logic in the
11:58 - cloud instead of in the client
12:00 - it lets you run serverless functions and
12:02 - interact with other backend services one
12:04 - huge benefit of this is for example to
12:06 - prevent cheating if all the logic runs
12:08 - in the client then a cheater can hack
12:10 - into your game but if only logic is
12:12 - server based then they can't really do
12:13 - much
12:14 - another benefit which is the same one
12:16 - for all cloud tools is you can make
12:17 - updates to your game without having to
12:19 - update the client
12:20 - for example you could run some logic in
12:22 - the cloud to define how many enemies are
12:24 - spawned on a certain level perhaps even
12:26 - some level generation or something like
12:28 - the enemy boss ai then if you wanted the
12:30 - ai to behave differently like for
12:32 - example maybe adding a bonus stage you
12:33 - could have that logic as a serverless
12:35 - function and then your players would see
12:37 - it immediately without having to update
12:38 - the game
12:39 - so it's a really interesting tool with a
12:41 - lot of potential for some really
12:42 - interesting interaction
12:44 - as for pricing you have free 1 million
12:46 - invocations per month
12:48 - then you've got 20 compute hours and
12:50 - finally one gigabytes of egress
12:53 - whether this is a lot is going to depend
12:54 - a lot on how you use it but it does
12:56 - sound like quite a ton invocations is
12:58 - how many times you call the function to
12:59 - run the cloud code then compute hours is
13:02 - how long that code takes to run and
13:04 - egress this is the amount of data going
13:06 - between cloud code and other back-end
13:07 - tools
13:08 - so based on that it does seem like these
13:10 - numbers are quite a massive amount all
13:12 - for free and the last management tool is
13:14 - called economy this one is not just for
13:16 - real-world money economy means anything
13:18 - with resources so could be something
13:20 - simple like in-game gold or maybe some
13:22 - credits this tool helps you manage
13:24 - everything related to the game's economy
13:26 - you can keep track of the balances and
13:28 - ownership for each player
13:30 - it helps you make it more secure so a
13:32 - cheater couldn't just break your game
13:33 - with a gold exploit it supports
13:35 - inventory management and keeping track
13:37 - of all the different balances
13:39 - and again being cloud-based means it
13:41 - lets you modify certain aspects of your
13:42 - in-game economy without having to push a
13:44 - client update so perhaps if your game is
13:47 - free to play and you want to make a
13:48 - discount on buying some premium currency
13:50 - or perhaps you decide a certain item
13:52 - should cost less you can do all of that
13:54 - update that logic without having to
13:56 - update the game client itself
13:58 - for pricing this one is based on rights
14:00 - and reads you can write and say that
14:02 - this player owns this amount of this
14:03 - thing you can do that a hundred thousand
14:05 - times per month and you can do a mill
14:07 - and read so million times asking what
14:09 - does the player inventory have so again
14:11 - these values seem like a huge amount
14:13 - okay so those are the tools on the first
14:15 - pillar for building the foundation of
14:16 - your game
14:17 - then for the next pillar this one is all
14:19 - about engaging your players and again in
14:21 - this page we have some more case studies
14:23 - of various games using these tools you
14:25 - can read about how among us improve
14:27 - their game with analytics
14:29 - how valrant added scalable voice and
14:31 - text chat using vivox
14:33 - and how no place for bravery how this
14:35 - game optimized their difficulty curve
14:37 - without needing to make some build
14:38 - updates
14:39 - so let's see all of these tools
14:41 - first one all of these are really
14:42 - related to analytics i actually already
14:44 - covered the older version of analytics
14:46 - they've now rebranded that one as legacy
14:48 - analytics and this is the new system
14:50 - which just came out of beta
14:52 - i'll have to look into this one to see
14:54 - what changed but basically it's still
14:55 - analytics
14:56 - meaning it's how you get data from your
14:58 - players to make your game better
15:00 - for example you can make an event when
15:01 - the player dies and analyze the
15:03 - analytics to see if way too many players
15:05 - are dying on the first level or not with
15:07 - that knowledge you can then go edit your
15:09 - game to make the level a bit easier or
15:11 - harder to get a nice smooth difficulty
15:12 - curve so it's really up to you to define
15:14 - what events are relevant to your game
15:16 - perhaps it's just the player that's per
15:18 - level perhaps it's coins or experience
15:20 - gathered maybe it's rare on loot drops
15:22 - or other interactions with other players
15:25 - so the analytics api really lets you
15:26 - define whatever event you want and here
15:29 - all these tools work in conjunction with
15:30 - analytics
15:32 - so with the data explorer you can easily
15:33 - visualize all of the data in the
15:35 - dashboard you can even export it to
15:37 - common formats like for example
15:38 - microsoft excel then you can create some
15:40 - funnels this allows you to very easily
15:42 - see how many players quit the game on
15:44 - level one versus level two maybe see how
15:46 - many do the first weapon upgrade versus
15:48 - the second one and so on
15:50 - then like i said the event manager so
15:52 - you can configure and track all of your
15:54 - custom events
15:55 - with the event browser you can see all
15:56 - the events that happened and then for
15:58 - real advanced use case you have the sql
16:00 - data explorer so you can use sql to make
16:02 - all kinds of queries on all the data you
16:04 - have
16:05 - in terms of pricing for analytics you
16:07 - have 25 million events per month for
16:09 - free again whether that is a lot or not
16:11 - won't depend on how many events you
16:13 - create but chances are 25 million that
16:15 - is a massive amount
16:17 - same thing with 2 000 query seconds per
16:19 - month making queries is super fast so
16:21 - that sounds like a ton for most use
16:23 - cases scrolling down onto the next
16:25 - section this one is all about player
16:26 - engagement so what do you do after
16:28 - gathering all those analytics
16:30 - now the first thing you can do is with
16:32 - this tool the game overrides like name
16:34 - implies this lets you override certain
16:35 - parameters in your games and this works
16:38 - particularly well when combined with the
16:39 - next one a b testing
16:41 - basically you can create custom
16:43 - audiences in your analytics and then
16:45 - combined with game overrides you can
16:46 - essentially give a slightly different
16:48 - experience to one group of players
16:50 - versus another
16:51 - then you can analyze that data and
16:52 - decide which changes you want to keep
16:54 - for all players so doing some a b
16:56 - testing is super useful it can really
16:58 - give you some real worm data on whether
17:00 - a certain change will improve your game
17:02 - or not or instead of using it to
17:04 - straight up improve your game you can
17:05 - use it for some special events for
17:07 - example say one specific country is
17:09 - having a special celebration instead of
17:11 - pushing that specific update to every
17:13 - single country you can use a b testing
17:15 - in order to make sure only the users in
17:17 - that one country receive that one
17:18 - special update everyone else still sees
17:21 - the same game
17:22 - in terms of pricing for game overrides
17:24 - and a b testing both these are free
17:26 - final one is push notifications in beta
17:28 - this one like name implies it's all
17:30 - about sending push notifications so it
17:32 - helps you re-engage some players who
17:33 - have lost interest in your game perhaps
17:35 - you want to tell them there's a new
17:36 - event or some new exciting update just
17:39 - send out a push notification and
17:40 - hopefully they won't be back to your
17:42 - game so with these tools combined with
17:44 - analytics with all of these combined you
17:46 - can see how it makes for a really
17:47 - powerful tool set to really analyze and
17:49 - improve your game now scrolling down we
17:51 - then see some community solutions we
17:53 - have voice chat and texture these go
17:55 - through vivox this is a tool for easily
17:57 - adding the voice and texture to your
17:59 - games it's in use by some of the biggest
18:01 - games in the industry so it's extremely
18:03 - solid and very scalable it's already
18:05 - being used by valrent and rainbow six
18:07 - siege
18:08 - and as you can guess by these two games
18:10 - they use it this works on all platforms
18:12 - so naturally it works with unity but
18:14 - also non-unity games and in terms of
18:16 - pricing this is one of those contact us
18:18 - kind of service
18:19 - and scrolling down some more we see one
18:21 - of the best tools that you absolutely
18:23 - must use cloud diagnostics this one is i
18:25 - would say the most useful of all this
18:27 - one is an absolute must if you want to
18:29 - release any game this one has existed
18:31 - for quite a long time and i've used it
18:33 - in pretty much every single one of my
18:34 - steam games and it has been extremely
18:36 - useful
18:37 - one issue you're always going to have
18:38 - when you launch a game is that regular
18:40 - players aren't really bug testers
18:42 - meaning that if they find a bug they
18:44 - don't know what info to give you so you
18:46 - can solve that certain bug and even if
18:48 - they do know what info to give you it's
18:49 - nearly impossible to convince a player
18:51 - to send you their own log files or
18:52 - remember what happened before the error
18:54 - what this does is it lets you receive
18:56 - crash reports automatically so if you
18:58 - have an air in your game like for
18:59 - example a simple known reference
19:01 - exception you can see it in real time on
19:03 - the dashboard you can then customize it
19:05 - with all kinds of events so you can
19:07 - figure out exactly what the player did
19:08 - to cause that error and with that
19:10 - knowledge you can fix it asap instead of
19:12 - having to wait for the player to send
19:13 - their logs
19:14 - so seriously if you release a game then
19:16 - you absolutely need to implement this
19:19 - and this one is also completely free
19:21 - okay so on to the final pillar this one
19:23 - is all about monetization and growth
19:25 - it's a bunch of tools all about helping
19:27 - you earn more from your games while of
19:28 - course making sure to provide a good
19:30 - experience first
19:31 - the first one is the unity ads sdk this
19:34 - is how you implement ads in your game
19:36 - you can choose some basic ads some
19:38 - rewarded ads some banners video and so
19:40 - on it's not something i'm very familiar
19:42 - with since i make premium pc games but
19:45 - if you're making something free to play
19:46 - then this is a must
19:48 - then in combination with dnt ads is next
19:50 - tool mediation this one basically lets
19:52 - you maximize the amount that you earned
19:54 - through ads by grouping them all
19:56 - together from all of the ad networks and
19:58 - then picking the best performing ads so
20:00 - if you use this and the player goes to
20:01 - see an ad in your game this tool checks
20:03 - the unt ads library checks the meta ad
20:05 - library checks for google admob and so
20:08 - on
20:08 - checks all of those and in the end
20:10 - compares all of them and selects the
20:11 - best ad for your game so you don't have
20:13 - to worry about having to choose which
20:15 - network you think will do best you just
20:17 - use this tool and the best one is chosen
20:18 - automatically from all of these networks
20:21 - then next tool is all about in-app
20:22 - purchases just like the name implies
20:24 - this is how you add in-app purchases or
20:26 - microtransactions onto your game the
20:28 - main benefit of this tool is how easily
20:30 - it works with pretty much every platform
20:32 - so you just set it up once and it works
20:34 - automatically in multiple stores you can
20:37 - get it working on the app store on the
20:38 - play store on the amazon store facebook
20:41 - windows and so on so if your game
20:43 - requires in-app purchases then this tool
20:45 - helps you easily add them and then
20:47 - something very crucial to running a
20:48 - successful free-to-play game which is
20:50 - how do you acquire the right users
20:52 - the goal with this tool is to help you
20:54 - find the audience that won't love your
20:55 - game again this is one area that i
20:57 - really know nothing about but if you're
20:59 - making free to play games and this is an
21:01 - absolute must the entire free to play
21:03 - business is really based on lowering the
21:05 - cost of acquiring new users you want
21:07 - that to be as low as possible in order
21:08 - to keep your game running and this tool
21:10 - helps you do that
21:11 - okay so those are all the tools that
21:13 - make up this platform which unity is
21:14 - calling the unity gaming services as you
21:17 - can see tons of really interesting tools
21:19 - regardless of what game you're making
21:20 - chances are a bunch of these are quite
21:22 - useful and some others might give you
21:24 - some ideas for some completely new games
21:26 - to make and if you're an indie game
21:28 - developer then chances are the free tier
21:30 - for all these tools chances are this one
21:32 - is more than enough so all these tools
21:33 - are likely completely free just for you
21:35 - now this video is meant as a quick
21:37 - overview of all these tools but now my
21:39 - question to you is of these which ones
21:41 - would you like to see in more detail
21:43 - for me i've been meaning to look into
21:45 - cloud content delivery and remote config
21:47 - for quite some time i've also only just
21:49 - recently learned about cloud code and
21:51 - looks quite interesting
21:53 - then i'd also love to experiment with
21:54 - making some mobile games and test out
21:56 - some of these mobile focus tools and of
21:58 - course when the netcode comes out of
22:00 - beta i'm looking forward to trying out
22:01 - all of those multiplayer tools so
22:03 - basically i'm personally interested in
22:05 - diving deeper into a lot of these but do
22:07 - let me know in the comments which one
22:08 - you are most interested in okay so go
22:10 - ahead and check out the unity gaming
22:11 - services page link in the description
22:13 - and get started for free alright hope
22:15 - that's useful check out these videos to
22:17 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
22:19 - patreon supporters for making these
22:21 - videos possible thank you for watching
22:23 - and i'll see you next time
22:27 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's learn all about unity gaming services what it is what tools it contains and how it can help you make better games this video is sponsored by unity now before i explain it just a quick question how many of you are actually familiar with the unity gaming services name brand let me know in the comments and i also made a poll in the community tab this is the name that unity have been using for its new platform of tools that they launched on last october so i'm curious to know how many of you already know the name unity gaming services and what it represents although even if you don't know this specific name you certainly know some of the tools under this brand basically what it is is a collection with tons of tools to help you build operate and grow your games all of these tools are extremely scalable and they've already been validated in real world use by games like phoneguys apex legends they've been used by valrantomongas vrising and tons more and before you get concerned like i've seen on some comments on other videos related to this topic all of these tools are either completely free or they have very generous free tiers if you're new developer like i see most of my audiences then the three tiers are unlikely more than enough for any game you want to make and if you just so happen to be unlucky and your game is a monumental hit then at that point the prices are more than worth it i just wanted to quickly point that out because the official video definitely looks a bit too marketing heavy which can certainly make you question whether this is a good thing or whether they're just trying to sell you something but it really is a great set of tools that are likely to be completely free for you but before we look at pricing let's first look at all the tools and see what they do and how they can help you with your own games this video actually end up pretty long since there are so many interesting tools to explain definitely do watch the whole thing maybe one of these is exactly what you need for your current game there's a really nice page where you can find all the tools and what they all do and the reason why unity sponsored this video right now is because pretty much all the tools that we're going to see all of them have just left beta and they're fully released the main one that is still in beta is the netcode for game objects this is unity's official networking library which it have been building for quite a while it's been in preview 1.0 for quite some time so i would guess it won't be fully released sometime later this year but other than that pretty much everything is done and fully released out of beta so let's look at all of these tools and how they can help you make better games faster the main page divides it into three core pillars first of all you have to also build your game foundation you can add multiplayer setup accounts push updates and so on then you can engage your players by using tools to tweak your game to perfection and connecting them together with either voice or text and finally you can grow your game and acquire new players to drive your revenue this is a really wide range of tools so which ones are useful is going to depend on what game you're making here let's do a quick overview of each tool what it does and how it can help you then perhaps in the future i'll dive deeper into each one of them there's also time steps in the video if you want to skip ahead to a particular tool okay so starting off over here with the multiplayer tools on this page the first thing that you see is a bunch of really interesting case studies on several games and how they use these to also great success you probably recognize apex legends and how they're using one of these tools to host their servers so if we scroll down here it is all these multiplayer tools let's start off with the one that is probably most useful to indie devs over here is relay this is a tool for helping you enable multiplayer in your games without having to use custom dedicated servers it basically helps you do peertopeer connections if you've ever tried making a multiplayer game and you run into issues related with nat and firewalls then this tool helps solve that this is a super useful tool i remember when i experimented making multiplayer for my game survivor squad gauntlets i tried handling it all myself but it was nearly impossible to deal with the net and all the firewalls that exist but when i implemented the old unit relay service it all worked perfectly so in terms of easily implementing multiplayer this is only super useful and as you can see it integrates easily with lobby netcode for game objects and even with mirror in terms of pricing if we scroll down and look at it over here on the relay you can see the first 50 ccu's are clearly free for each month just in case you don't know ccus are concurrent connected users meaning you can have 50 players playing the game at the exact same time and all of it for free now again that's at the same time so that's not 50 players total so as one drops and another one joins the total number of concurrent users stays the same so 50 cc use actually quite a lot and if your game blows up and you get a massive amount of players then it just costs an additional 16 cents per additional ccu next thing to worry about is bandwidth which again is also pretty generous you have three gigabytes per user up to 150 total that's a massive amount for a multiplayer game since multiplayer data packets are usually pretty tiny the next multiplayer tool we can look at is over here on lobby this one lets you create public and private lobbies for all your games so it's kind of like a master server to help you connect players to one another without having to deal with direct ips again for my own personal experience when i worked on some multiplayer i had to build my own master server from scratch doing that was a ton of work and didn't really work very well so an easy to use tool like this one is absolutely excellent and again if we scroll down we can see that all of these tools are made to easily work with one another so you can use lobby to create a private lobby for all of your friends to join then you can connect them all together with relay and possibly manage all of the data packets using netcode for game objects for handling the game data so all these tools are really meant to easily work with one another pricing for lobby is again very generous this is just some lobby so i assume data sizes are really tiny so 10 gigabytes for free on a per region basis this one really sounds like a ton the next multiplayer tool that we can see over here is multiply this is the one that is used by apex legends so it has been thoroughly battletested what it is is a cloud infrastructure service for handling all of your game server hosting so as your game grows and shrinks it automatically adds or removes service from the pool if he can support a massive game like apex legends going from zero to 50 million players in under 24 days if it can handle that then it won't have no issues supporting any game this one is a pretty serious tool for some very highend games so for this one in order to get started you contact unity so it seems like for most indie games you're going to be just fine using the relay if you have a really serious game where you expect a really massive release that's where multiplayer takes over and helps you set up dedicated game servers and the next tool which works in combination with multiplayer is matchmaker this one like the name implies handles matchmaking so you define all the rules all the logic for handling your matchmaking like for example the player's skill level what specific gear they're using maybe the player character and level and so on it's up to you to define all of those rules and then matchmaker tries to find a match for players using those search settings again this is another preseries tool for some pretty highend multiplayer games so if this one looks useful then contact unity and the final tool in this section is over here the netcode for game objects like i said this one is the one that is still in beta this is unity's official networking library and it's currently in active development there's already a really nice simple project that you can download to see how it works i'm definitely going to be covering this tool with lots of videos when it comes out of beta so these are the various multiplayer tools as you can see tons of things to help you make multiple games you can build your game with netcode for game objects then you can use lobby to create lobbies to help your players find one another you can use relay to connect them all together regardless of firewall or net then if your game is massive you can host dedicated game servers with multiplayer and you can match players together using matchmaker so tons of tools really to help you make multiplayer games now scrolling down the next section this one is all about accounts first of all you have cloud save like name implies this one handles cloud saving normally for my own games i use teams cloud save but the obvious downside of that is that it only works on seam whereas this service works on any platform anywhere you can save whatever that you want so it can be user settings maybe some playtime statistics maybe you want to save the player progression so you can easily implement crossplatform progression since it works across multiple devices you can let players play on their pc then load up the same game on mobile and continue from there for pricing again the free tier is really generous you have five gigabytes of data you can sort per month that's a massive amount usually save files from my games are between just one or a hundred kilobytes so five gigabytes is essentially infinite you'd probably need hundreds or thousands of players before reaching this level then you have one million rights and reads per month also a huge amount and of course you are the one who decides how often you want to save and load the next tool under accounts is authentication this one works perfectly in combination with cloud save basically you need to know what user owns what saves so this is how you authenticate them and of course you can authenticate your user regardless of whatever platform they're on authentication is one of those things that is always super tricky to handle there are so many potential security issues that can easily pop up and just break your game if you try implementing it yourself so tool like this to easily make that process super easy is really useful it works in combination with lobby and matchmaker so you can invite your friends over and all of the user data saved in the economy tool which we're going to see in a bit all of that is naturally behind authentication so it all stays nice and secure and one huge benefit of this is that it also supports anonymous signin so you don't have to annoy your users and force them to create an account with just one click it automatically creates an anonymous user and lets your players use all these tools in terms of pricing there isn't any authentication is always free scrolling down some more we see a bunch of tools on game management the first one is cloud content delivery this one is all about delivering updates to your game and as usual since it's from the cloud it does not require a build update this integrates very easily with the addressable system that's actually one system that i've been meaning to cover you basically define the path to some object some asset or something then with this you can upload those assets to the cloud and the next time the player plays your game they won't see the updated data for example this is perfect for making some limited time events you just upload the event assets then using the next one that we're going to see remote config with that you can start the event so the players see the new limited time assets and then you can end it and this uses a reliable content delivery network so acdn if you don't know what that is it's basically servers spread throughout the entire world so when the player plays your game they can request data from the server closest to them instead of having to go all the way to the other side of the world this one is a really interesting tool definitely something that i want to research along with the addressables that's also another one that i really want to cover and in terms of pricing you can see you have 50 gigabytes for free per month again whether that is a lot or not is going to depend on what kind of data you're delivering if it's some super highend 8k textures then 50 gigs might not be too much but this is really meant for some quick simple updates if you have a huge update that requires a massive amount of data in that case doing a regular update to the build would be the best approach so if you use this tool correctly then this free tier 50 gigabytes per month is likely way more than enough the next game management tool is over here remote config this is another one that i've been meaning to look at for quite some time it's a pretty simple tool but potentially very useful it's similar to the previous one in that this is data that you can store in the cloud in some server and your players download but rather than assets this one is meant for easily modifying certain parameters so you have a really nice dashboard where you can see all of the parameters that you defined and with a simple click you can just change them so for example if all of your players are having a lot of trouble in level 2 you can define a parameter for the gold reward amount on level 1 and with a simple click you can change it and as usual this works extremely well when combined with many of the other tools previously i mentioned working together with cloud content delivery then you can also make it work correctly with game overrides you can also do some a b testing which we're going to see in a bit so for example one group of players would receive a certain xp for completing a quest another group would get a different amount then you can analyze the data to see which one is working as you intended in terms of pricing for remote config it's always free the next tool is cloud code this is one way to run your logic in the cloud instead of in the client it lets you run serverless functions and interact with other backend services one huge benefit of this is for example to prevent cheating if all the logic runs in the client then a cheater can hack into your game but if only logic is server based then they can't really do much another benefit which is the same one for all cloud tools is you can make updates to your game without having to update the client for example you could run some logic in the cloud to define how many enemies are spawned on a certain level perhaps even some level generation or something like the enemy boss ai then if you wanted the ai to behave differently like for example maybe adding a bonus stage you could have that logic as a serverless function and then your players would see it immediately without having to update the game so it's a really interesting tool with a lot of potential for some really interesting interaction as for pricing you have free 1 million invocations per month then you've got 20 compute hours and finally one gigabytes of egress whether this is a lot is going to depend a lot on how you use it but it does sound like quite a ton invocations is how many times you call the function to run the cloud code then compute hours is how long that code takes to run and egress this is the amount of data going between cloud code and other backend tools so based on that it does seem like these numbers are quite a massive amount all for free and the last management tool is called economy this one is not just for realworld money economy means anything with resources so could be something simple like ingame gold or maybe some credits this tool helps you manage everything related to the game's economy you can keep track of the balances and ownership for each player it helps you make it more secure so a cheater couldn't just break your game with a gold exploit it supports inventory management and keeping track of all the different balances and again being cloudbased means it lets you modify certain aspects of your ingame economy without having to push a client update so perhaps if your game is free to play and you want to make a discount on buying some premium currency or perhaps you decide a certain item should cost less you can do all of that update that logic without having to update the game client itself for pricing this one is based on rights and reads you can write and say that this player owns this amount of this thing you can do that a hundred thousand times per month and you can do a mill and read so million times asking what does the player inventory have so again these values seem like a huge amount okay so those are the tools on the first pillar for building the foundation of your game then for the next pillar this one is all about engaging your players and again in this page we have some more case studies of various games using these tools you can read about how among us improve their game with analytics how valrant added scalable voice and text chat using vivox and how no place for bravery how this game optimized their difficulty curve without needing to make some build updates so let's see all of these tools first one all of these are really related to analytics i actually already covered the older version of analytics they've now rebranded that one as legacy analytics and this is the new system which just came out of beta i'll have to look into this one to see what changed but basically it's still analytics meaning it's how you get data from your players to make your game better for example you can make an event when the player dies and analyze the analytics to see if way too many players are dying on the first level or not with that knowledge you can then go edit your game to make the level a bit easier or harder to get a nice smooth difficulty curve so it's really up to you to define what events are relevant to your game perhaps it's just the player that's per level perhaps it's coins or experience gathered maybe it's rare on loot drops or other interactions with other players so the analytics api really lets you define whatever event you want and here all these tools work in conjunction with analytics so with the data explorer you can easily visualize all of the data in the dashboard you can even export it to common formats like for example microsoft excel then you can create some funnels this allows you to very easily see how many players quit the game on level one versus level two maybe see how many do the first weapon upgrade versus the second one and so on then like i said the event manager so you can configure and track all of your custom events with the event browser you can see all the events that happened and then for real advanced use case you have the sql data explorer so you can use sql to make all kinds of queries on all the data you have in terms of pricing for analytics you have 25 million events per month for free again whether that is a lot or not won't depend on how many events you create but chances are 25 million that is a massive amount same thing with 2 000 query seconds per month making queries is super fast so that sounds like a ton for most use cases scrolling down onto the next section this one is all about player engagement so what do you do after gathering all those analytics now the first thing you can do is with this tool the game overrides like name implies this lets you override certain parameters in your games and this works particularly well when combined with the next one a b testing basically you can create custom audiences in your analytics and then combined with game overrides you can essentially give a slightly different experience to one group of players versus another then you can analyze that data and decide which changes you want to keep for all players so doing some a b testing is super useful it can really give you some real worm data on whether a certain change will improve your game or not or instead of using it to straight up improve your game you can use it for some special events for example say one specific country is having a special celebration instead of pushing that specific update to every single country you can use a b testing in order to make sure only the users in that one country receive that one special update everyone else still sees the same game in terms of pricing for game overrides and a b testing both these are free final one is push notifications in beta this one like name implies it's all about sending push notifications so it helps you reengage some players who have lost interest in your game perhaps you want to tell them there's a new event or some new exciting update just send out a push notification and hopefully they won't be back to your game so with these tools combined with analytics with all of these combined you can see how it makes for a really powerful tool set to really analyze and improve your game now scrolling down we then see some community solutions we have voice chat and texture these go through vivox this is a tool for easily adding the voice and texture to your games it's in use by some of the biggest games in the industry so it's extremely solid and very scalable it's already being used by valrent and rainbow six siege and as you can guess by these two games they use it this works on all platforms so naturally it works with unity but also nonunity games and in terms of pricing this is one of those contact us kind of service and scrolling down some more we see one of the best tools that you absolutely must use cloud diagnostics this one is i would say the most useful of all this one is an absolute must if you want to release any game this one has existed for quite a long time and i've used it in pretty much every single one of my steam games and it has been extremely useful one issue you're always going to have when you launch a game is that regular players aren't really bug testers meaning that if they find a bug they don't know what info to give you so you can solve that certain bug and even if they do know what info to give you it's nearly impossible to convince a player to send you their own log files or remember what happened before the error what this does is it lets you receive crash reports automatically so if you have an air in your game like for example a simple known reference exception you can see it in real time on the dashboard you can then customize it with all kinds of events so you can figure out exactly what the player did to cause that error and with that knowledge you can fix it asap instead of having to wait for the player to send their logs so seriously if you release a game then you absolutely need to implement this and this one is also completely free okay so on to the final pillar this one is all about monetization and growth it's a bunch of tools all about helping you earn more from your games while of course making sure to provide a good experience first the first one is the unity ads sdk this is how you implement ads in your game you can choose some basic ads some rewarded ads some banners video and so on it's not something i'm very familiar with since i make premium pc games but if you're making something free to play then this is a must then in combination with dnt ads is next tool mediation this one basically lets you maximize the amount that you earned through ads by grouping them all together from all of the ad networks and then picking the best performing ads so if you use this and the player goes to see an ad in your game this tool checks the unt ads library checks the meta ad library checks for google admob and so on checks all of those and in the end compares all of them and selects the best ad for your game so you don't have to worry about having to choose which network you think will do best you just use this tool and the best one is chosen automatically from all of these networks then next tool is all about inapp purchases just like the name implies this is how you add inapp purchases or microtransactions onto your game the main benefit of this tool is how easily it works with pretty much every platform so you just set it up once and it works automatically in multiple stores you can get it working on the app store on the play store on the amazon store facebook windows and so on so if your game requires inapp purchases then this tool helps you easily add them and then something very crucial to running a successful freetoplay game which is how do you acquire the right users the goal with this tool is to help you find the audience that won't love your game again this is one area that i really know nothing about but if you're making free to play games and this is an absolute must the entire free to play business is really based on lowering the cost of acquiring new users you want that to be as low as possible in order to keep your game running and this tool helps you do that okay so those are all the tools that make up this platform which unity is calling the unity gaming services as you can see tons of really interesting tools regardless of what game you're making chances are a bunch of these are quite useful and some others might give you some ideas for some completely new games to make and if you're an indie game developer then chances are the free tier for all these tools chances are this one is more than enough so all these tools are likely completely free just for you now this video is meant as a quick overview of all these tools but now my question to you is of these which ones would you like to see in more detail for me i've been meaning to look into cloud content delivery and remote config for quite some time i've also only just recently learned about cloud code and looks quite interesting then i'd also love to experiment with making some mobile games and test out some of these mobile focus tools and of course when the netcode comes out of beta i'm looking forward to trying out all of those multiplayer tools so basically i'm personally interested in diving deeper into a lot of these but do let me know in the comments which one you are most interested in okay so go ahead and check out the unity gaming services page link in the description and get started for free alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
