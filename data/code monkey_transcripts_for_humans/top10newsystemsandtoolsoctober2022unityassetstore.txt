00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - only check out some highlights for
00:09 - October 22. this one is a list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I
00:13 - already covered the best free new assets
00:14 - so go watch that if you haven't seen it
00:15 - let me know in the comments if you pick
00:17 - up any of these and what you intend to
00:18 - do with them as always there's links to
00:20 - us in the description and as a bonus you
00:22 - can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get
00:23 - 10 off your org also right now there's
00:26 - two bundles with huge discounts there's
00:28 - a Unity mega ball with 30 tools I would
00:31 - say this one is worth it just for the
00:32 - asset inventory alone
00:34 - it helps you search for anything in all
00:36 - the assets you own so this one has been
00:38 - super useful to me to find some props
00:40 - and objects for my steam game
00:42 - and there's also a Humble Bundle with
00:44 - tons of realistic environments they are
00:46 - all super high quality photogrammetry
00:47 - assets so you feel like a realistic art
00:50 - style definitely give it a look alright
00:52 - so starting off with an interesting one
00:53 - the survival engine online as you might
00:56 - know netcode for game objects was fully
00:58 - released just a while ago I made a super
01:00 - detailed video tutorial covering tons of
01:02 - things about it in there there were a
01:04 - bunch of comments asking me to make a
01:05 - course or some game samples to learn how
01:07 - it all works I'm still trying to
01:08 - organize my schedule to see if I can
01:10 - build such a thing but in the meantime
01:11 - here you have a very complex sample it's
01:14 - based on the survival engine which is
01:15 - Nest that has exists on the store for a
01:17 - long time
01:18 - features chopping down wood placing some
01:21 - buildings farming cooking hunting
01:22 - crafting and a bunch more again all of
01:25 - it in multiplayer using netcode for game
01:27 - objects
01:28 - so if you want to see a complete sample
01:30 - for how those mechanics can be built or
01:32 - if you just want to make a multiplayer
01:33 - survival game then check this one out
01:35 - next up if you want your game to look
01:37 - gorgeous then one easy way to do that is
01:39 - adding some nice weather changing the
01:41 - Skybox really is one of the best easiest
01:43 - changes you can do to make your game
01:45 - look much much better
01:46 - this one includes not just the Skybox
01:48 - but an entire weather system features
01:51 - quite a lot of variety so you have
01:52 - everything from sunny days to some
01:54 - intense storms you have some dense fog
01:56 - and some nice Autumn scene Works in urp
01:59 - and looks really nice then here's a
02:01 - really awesome tool called colorize it
02:03 - lets you easily change colors on
02:05 - materials by modifying the color palette
02:07 - this one is obviously perfect for meshes
02:09 - with solid colors so everything like low
02:11 - poly assets which is a sound that I very
02:13 - much like to use the main thing that I
02:15 - like is how apparently it lets you place
02:16 - down some colors with a mission so it
02:19 - looks like you can very easily make
02:20 - certain body parts glow that feature
02:22 - alone looks super useful and also you
02:25 - can generate the entire color palettes
02:26 - and swap them out easily so if you use
02:28 - low poly senior game then this tool can
02:31 - definitely be very useful if you'd like
02:33 - to show a web page in your game look at
02:34 - this one seems to be a very complete
02:37 - package it runs JavaScript supports
02:39 - https supports oauth payment methods and
02:42 - tons more
02:43 - the size is customizable it can even
02:45 - play videos and also support uploading
02:47 - photos directly from the camera
02:49 - see if your game has any content on a
02:51 - browser like for example you have a
02:53 - Steam Workshop or some forums then for
02:55 - that it don't like this one can be much
02:56 - easier than building it all from scratch
02:58 - natively with the ntui if you want to
03:00 - build some Vox on worms and look at this
03:02 - one importantly this is an in-game level
03:04 - editor so it works while the game is
03:06 - running this kind of thing is excellent
03:08 - for letting your players mod the game
03:10 - they can build their own levels objects
03:12 - are anything and easily share them
03:13 - between them and it's not just levels
03:15 - it's not just dumb blocks you can play
03:17 - some blocks with lights and even add
03:19 - some Behavior to allow you to open close
03:21 - doors or any other thing very useful if
03:23 - your game is Vox on base next is a nice
03:26 - and simple tool usually objects don't
03:28 - render on the inside if you want that to
03:30 - happen then The Simple Solution is to
03:32 - make the rendering double-sided but if
03:34 - for some reason you don't want to do
03:36 - that maybe you can't modify the material
03:37 - or it will change way too many things
03:40 - then with this tool you can just add a
03:42 - little bit of geometry to be able to see
03:43 - inside it's simple and does exactly what
03:46 - you expect then if you have tons of 3D
03:48 - objects and you want to easily position
03:50 - them look at this tool features lots of
03:52 - parameters to position all the objects
03:54 - exactly as you want them there are
03:56 - plenty of layout types you can place
03:57 - things in a grid you can place them all
03:59 - the spiral one curve randomly and more
04:02 - also includes animated components so
04:04 - your objects move into place in a really
04:06 - nice really satisfying way this looks
04:08 - quite useful for easily positioning
04:10 - object sign input next if your game
04:12 - features bugs then maybe I'll look at
04:14 - this controller the obvious thing is the
04:16 - leg ik system so as the ant moves
04:19 - forward the legs move forward with it
04:20 - all you really need to do is just move
04:22 - the main transform and everything else
04:24 - will look good features lots of settings
04:26 - to play around with you can easily swap
04:28 - with lengths so it's a very Niche tool
04:30 - but if you're making a bug game then I
04:31 - can see this being quite useful then if
04:33 - you'd like to make a Parker game here is
04:35 - a Parker player controller supports
04:37 - jumping crouching and while running you
04:40 - can go around curved surfaces you can
04:42 - move up while while running also has
04:44 - ledge climbing and moving platforms so
04:46 - it's pretty nice if you'd like to make a
04:48 - parkour or ninja game if your game is 2D
04:50 - and you need some interesting Shadows
04:52 - look at this one the main thing is they
04:54 - are extremely adaptable you can make
04:56 - them completely solid or Fade Out Over
04:58 - the distance you can rotate the Sun in
05:00 - the sky also includes a water Shader a
05:02 - wind Shader and some Sprite Rim lighting
05:04 - definitely a great way to add that extra
05:06 - bit of Polish to your 2D game alright so
05:08 - those are my top 10 new tools and
05:10 - systems on the NTS store for October 22
05:12 - there's a link so in the description and
05:14 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
05:15 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and
05:17 - also check out my own free and paid ads
05:19 - on the store alright hope that's useful
05:21 - and check out these videos to learn some
05:23 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
05:25 - supporters for making these videos

05:28 - see you next time
