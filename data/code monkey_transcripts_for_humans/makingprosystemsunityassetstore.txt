00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and over the years i've made over 400
00:04 - videos covering all kinds of systems
00:06 - the videos are usually just simple demos
00:08 - to showcase how something works and
00:09 - nothing else
00:10 - the goal is to educate you and not
00:12 - necessarily to build a production-ready
00:14 - system
00:14 - but i would like to expand upon some of
00:16 - these systems and make them into
00:18 - proper easy to use packages that you can
00:20 - easily drag and drop into your games
00:22 - without much effort
00:23 - so for that i've decided to try making
00:25 - pro versions of some of those assets
00:27 - the goal is to expand upon them and make
00:29 - some proper versions that are feature
00:30 - complete and super easy to use
00:32 - and of course since my whole channel is
00:34 - about teaching these assets will also
00:36 - contain a very detailed video
00:37 - going through all the code step by step
00:39 - so you can learn how it all works
00:41 - which kind of means that each asset will
00:43 - in itself be a sort of mini course
00:45 - one system that i covered in a free
00:47 - video a while ago was the mouse cursor
00:49 - system
00:50 - so the very first pro asset that is out
00:52 - right now is the mouse cursor system pro
00:54 - this is a fully featured system for
00:56 - adding custom animated cursors onto your
00:58 - games
00:59 - nowadays in order for your games to find
01:00 - success you absolutely need to stand out
01:02 - from the crowd
01:03 - and adding some custom animated cursors
01:05 - is an easy way to add that extra bit of
01:07 - polish to make your game really shine
01:09 - it comes with a custom editor that makes
01:11 - it super simple to use
01:12 - you just draw a texture in any program
01:14 - you want then create a new cursor object
01:16 - and drag the texture onto it
01:18 - use the editor to set up everything like
01:20 - all of your frames the frame rate and
01:22 - set the clickable position
01:23 - and that's it it all works perfectly
01:26 - included with the acid are 24 pre-made
01:28 - cursors you can easily apply to your
01:30 - games
01:30 - and again it also comes with a very
01:32 - detailed walkthrough video going through
01:34 - all the code step by step so you can
01:35 - learn how it all works
01:36 - so if you just want to use it it's super
01:38 - simple and easy to add to your games
01:40 - and if you want to dig deep and learn
01:42 - how it all works then you can do that
01:43 - too
01:44 - as i mentioned i covered the basis for
01:45 - this system in a free video before
01:47 - so if you want you can put in the work
01:49 - and try to build yourself or you can
01:51 - just pick up the pro version which will
01:52 - save you a ton of time and give you a
01:54 - very easy to use feature complete system
01:56 - along with a detailed walkthrough video
01:58 - which works as a mini course there's a
02:00 - link in the description to pick it up
02:01 - and you can use the coupon code monkey10
02:03 - to get 10 off your order
02:05 - i'm really excited about this idea
02:07 - there's quite a bunch of systems that i
02:08 - covered on the channel that i'd love to
02:10 - expand upon and turn them into proper
02:11 - assets
02:12 - so let me know in the comments which
02:14 - ones you'd like to see so perhaps the
02:16 - grid system or maybe the crafting system
02:18 - or some mml agents examples or maybe a
02:20 - factory game template
02:22 - let me know what you'd like to see
02:23 - alright thank you for watching and i'll
02:25 - see you next time
