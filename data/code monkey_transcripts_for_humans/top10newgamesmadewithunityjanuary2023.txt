00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made within the launching January
00:05 - 23. this was an interesting month for
00:07 - some reason there were tons of Chinese
00:09 - games released and a bunch of them
00:10 - actually did quite well I guess maybe in
00:13 - lots of people wanted to launch before
00:14 - the Lunar New Year whatever the reason
00:16 - it just means more awesome games for you
00:18 - to play although of course it also means
00:20 - more competition for you as a developer
00:21 - so pros and cons the reason why I make
00:23 - these videos is to show you everything
00:24 - that the engine can do the limit is
00:26 - really just your own skills and
00:27 - Imagination and the variety and the
00:29 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:30 - really puts onto the test all of these
00:32 - games are unequally impressive so the
00:33 - list is in no particular order except
00:35 - for the number one game that is my
00:36 - personal pick of the month by the way
00:37 - I'm currently working on my own steam
00:39 - game called turnover Liberation it's a
00:40 - game with tons of systems open world
00:42 - survival crafting automation strategy
00:44 - check out the SIM page edit to your wish
00:46 - list and follow for that mods and
00:47 - actually before we get to the unte top
00:49 - 10 list let me give a quick honorable
00:51 - mention to a game that is actually made
00:52 - with unreal that just came out this
00:54 - month it's called punch a bunch this was
00:56 - made by YouTuber pontypants it has been
00:58 - in development for almost 3 years I've
01:00 - enjoyed watching the devlogs all this
01:02 - time and thankfully the release is
01:03 - actually going really well already has
01:05 - almost 500 very positive reviews so I'm
01:07 - really happy to see it succeed humble
01:09 - has just launched a new bundle full of
01:11 - cinti assets as you probably know I love
01:13 - their low polystyle the bundle has tons
01:15 - of variety with 20 packs with the usual
01:17 - super dip discount at 97 off or if you
01:20 - prefer something more realistic there's
01:21 - another one with tons of high-res
01:23 - military Assets Now this one is
01:25 - technically an unreal pack but you can
01:27 - just import it into unreal and then
01:28 - export the meshes which you can then
01:30 - import into ENT okay so starting off the
01:32 - top 10 Unity list and at number 10 here
01:35 - we have a very spooky and very unique
01:37 - game death and water too visually it
01:39 - looks great definitely one of the best
01:41 - looking games made with yinty it said in
01:43 - deep water with lots of sharks some
01:45 - weird creatures hunting it down for me
01:46 - I'm absolutely not a fan of either
01:48 - horror or the deep sea so this one is
01:50 - most definitely not for me but if you do
01:52 - like horror games and this seems like a
01:54 - really nice new entry in the genre the
01:55 - game features in large open world you
01:57 - can explore to discover all kinds of
01:59 - Secrets and give them Loot and then it
02:01 - also has a wave-based mechanic where
02:03 - some very spooky creatures hunt you down
02:04 - and on top of that there's a very scary
02:06 - Kraken that mind controls the creatures
02:08 - making for some really tense gameplay
02:10 - the atmosphere for this game looks
02:12 - really perfect for exactly what it was
02:13 - trying to achieve so if you're a fan of
02:15 - horror or the deep sea then definitely
02:16 - check this out up next here we have an
02:18 - interesting one called Juno new Origins
02:20 - you might know it by its previous name
02:22 - simple rocket Zoo so it's a sequel to
02:24 - that very popular game from years ago
02:26 - but in the meantime the game expanded so
02:28 - much as the devs felt it in a brand new
02:30 - name it's a Sandbox building game
02:32 - features very realistic physics you can
02:34 - build your own spaceship you can build a
02:36 - car a plane or just about anything you
02:38 - can also write code to get the vehicles
02:40 - working exactly as intended you can even
02:41 - customize the solar system itself you
02:43 - can play in sandbox or a nice career
02:45 - mode and of course it has excellent
02:46 - modding support so you can see what the
02:48 - community has built and share your own
02:50 - Creations so if you're a fan of complex
02:51 - very deep games definitely give it a
02:53 - look I'd love to play it out to check
02:54 - out just how deep that programming goes
02:56 - next here is yet another one that also
02:58 - has a nice devlog on YouTube it atrio
03:00 - the Dark World the first devlog was
03:03 - three and a half years ago and right now
03:04 - it just left early access it has a very
03:06 - distinct visual sound it's a bit strange
03:08 - but it certainly does stand out the game
03:10 - has some nice Automation and survival
03:12 - elements you spawn a brand new
03:13 - disposable Android body every time you
03:16 - go out and explore the world set up
03:17 - machines to automate farming crafting
03:19 - forging and a bunch more you dodge some
03:21 - creature attacks and capture them to use
03:23 - in your own factories definitely has a
03:24 - very unique very strange theme and
03:26 - people do seem to like it with already
03:28 - over 300 very positive reviews for some
03:30 - VR here is a recent huge hit it's
03:33 - gorilla tag I still haven't gotten fully
03:35 - used to this much movement in VR so I'm
03:37 - definitely envious by how much fun all
03:38 - of these people are having the game
03:40 - looks simple but also really awesome the
03:42 - movement is on based on your arms so
03:43 - RAV4 then pull back in order to move or
03:46 - jump just that movement system gives you
03:48 - a ton of Freedom the levels are all very
03:50 - unique and look very fun to move around
03:51 - in the game modes are simple either run
03:53 - away or catch someone but despite being
03:55 - simple it looks like it really works
03:57 - there's tons of positive feedback and
03:58 - already has 800 very positive reviews
04:01 - which is definitely a huge amount for a
04:02 - VR game then here we have one that I'm
04:04 - actually surprised that it's the first
04:06 - time that I've seen this idea it's
04:07 - called definitely not fried chicken so
04:09 - right away excellent Name the name alone
04:11 - combined with the game ID won't
04:13 - definitely ensure this game finds some
04:14 - success basically it's Breaking Bad the
04:16 - game you have a business growing and
04:18 - selling some let's say less than legal
04:20 - goods and then you have various fronts
04:22 - including obviously a chicken shop it's
04:24 - definitely a very good idea having a
04:25 - front makes for some nice easy comedy
04:27 - and the game itself also seems solidly
04:29 - made you have tons of options for all
04:31 - the kinds of goods you can grow and sell
04:32 - there's lots of building types you can
04:34 - own not just restaurants you can make
04:36 - money legally or illegally you can
04:37 - manage your employees manage the growing
04:39 - delivering and selling of all the goods
04:41 - it just launched in Early Access so
04:43 - there are some rough Parts but the core
04:44 - of it does seem solid then for something
04:46 - a bit more chill here is selling era
04:48 - it's a RPG with some gorgeous art you
04:50 - see on the Seas do some trading business
04:52 - fight some Bandits or find some love in
04:54 - a Tavern there are multiple characters
04:56 - in your party each with their own levels
04:58 - and skills it's one of those RPGs where
04:59 - your party follows your character in a
05:01 - line then you can fight battles out at
05:03 - sea or board their ship and engage in
05:05 - some nice turn-based combat it's already
05:07 - a huge hit with over 2 000 mostly
05:09 - positive reviews then if you're into
05:10 - card games here is Theseus protocol
05:12 - really gorgeous art and animations the
05:14 - music also sounds excellent It's a deck
05:16 - building roguelike so you gather your
05:18 - troops and your cards in order to engage
05:20 - in battle it also has a nice non-linear
05:22 - narrative that you can uncover more and
05:24 - more through every run and it also has
05:26 - some persistent progression for your
05:27 - deck the presentation is definitely
05:28 - excellent and so far the Early Access
05:30 - reviews do seem to like it next here we
05:32 - have farlanders it's a very interesting
05:34 - extremely complex looking City Builder
05:36 - game lots of systems and lots of
05:38 - buildings at your disposal it's also
05:39 - turn based which I'm not entirely sure
05:41 - how that is supposed to work so I'm
05:42 - certainly intrigued by that there are
05:44 - lots of buildings lots of complexity
05:45 - your job is to terraform Mars to make it
05:48 - habitable for your colonists you can
05:49 - build on the surface of Mars but then
05:51 - you can also dive deep underground and
05:53 - build some more you can explore a deep
05:54 - Tech Tree and make Mars your brand new
05:56 - home it has a demo if you'd like to try
05:58 - it out then here's an interesting one
05:59 - that came right at the end of January
06:01 - it's called in culinary right away you
06:03 - can see a very interesting visual looks
06:05 - like medieval manuscripts with some
06:07 - weird creatures it makes me wonder if
06:09 - they decided to the only launch in order
06:10 - to not only is around the same time as
06:12 - pentiment the game definitely does look
06:14 - really good the game itself is a
06:16 - turn-based strategy game it features
06:17 - quite a nice amount of verticality the
06:19 - levels aren't just horizontal planes so
06:21 - you can climb up some ladders and push
06:23 - down some creatures it has a nice single
06:25 - player mode where you explore a map and
06:26 - gather more creatures and skills and it
06:28 - also has a multiplayer Skirmish mode
06:30 - where you can choose an army skills a
06:32 - map and balance it out with a friend or
06:34 - a foe and at number one for my personal
06:36 - pick of the month here is a really
06:38 - interesting game called Rising front
06:39 - looking at the massive scale in the
06:41 - trailer you might think it's a
06:42 - multiplayer game but nope it is single
06:44 - player you command massive armies in
06:46 - World War One within first person it
06:48 - features a ton of Mayhem some massive
06:50 - scale with ragdolls flying all over the
06:52 - place it has intelligent AI a cover
06:54 - system lots of trenches some real-time
06:56 - building and more it's being built by a
06:58 - solid developer and already has over 500
07:01 - very positive reviews so this one looks
07:03 - like it's going to be a huge hit at
07:04 - least mechanically it doesn't look very
07:05 - unique so if you enjoyed playing Verdun
07:07 - like I did and you wouldn't like a
07:09 - single Prime version then this looks
07:10 - really interesting I definitely want to
07:12 - give it a try alright so that's 10
07:13 - awesome new games made with the entire
07:15 - launch in January 23. I hope this list
07:17 - helped you see how the NT engine is
07:18 - capable of building anything the limits
07:20 - are really just here on skills and
07:21 - Imagination check out my own Sim game
07:23 - total warm Liberation and add it to your
07:25 - wishlist alright hope that's useful
