00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey a
00:02 - while ago I launched my two free
00:04 - complete courses one is Target that
00:06 - complete beginners on learning how to
00:08 - make a game in unity starting commonly
00:10 - from scratch and the second one starts
00:12 - from where that first one lets off and
00:14 - is on converting that game into
00:15 - multiplayer the project starts coming
00:17 - from scratch and go step by step like
00:19 - your band lecture until the final polish
00:21 - game so here is a quick overview of
00:23 - everything done during those two courses
00:25 - so first of all we're going to start
00:27 - commonly from scratch by selecting a
00:29 - Unity version and creating a brand new
00:31 - project with that new project we will
00:34 - then learn all about the basics of the
00:35 - UNT interface and setup plane layout
00:38 - then the other important part is Visual
00:40 - Studio which is where we're going to be
00:41 - writing all of our code after that comes
00:44 - an extremely important lecture all about
00:46 - coding style in naming rules like I said
00:48 - the code in this course is on the same
00:49 - level of quantity as my Steam games so
00:51 - having proper naming rules and good code
00:53 - sound is Paramount next we're going to
00:55 - download and import all the assets that
00:58 - we're going to use in the course
00:58 - everything is included so you can follow
01:00 - along with every step of the way
01:02 - with yes it's important we're going to
01:04 - set up some quick post processing just
01:06 - to make the game look good then for our
01:08 - first piece of logic we're going to make
01:10 - a simple character controller
01:12 - with that logic working we will then
01:13 - Implement a proper character visual with
01:15 - the included assets next we're going to
01:18 - learn the basics of animation and the
01:20 - animator component and with that we're
01:22 - going to make our player really come
01:23 - alive with some simple but really nice
01:25 - animations then we're going to install
01:27 - the send machine package this isn't
01:29 - actually used too much in this course
01:31 - but I still wanted to include it because
01:32 - it is such a useful tool so I do want
01:34 - you to know about it after that comes
01:36 - another extremely extremely important
01:38 - lecture with regards to writing some
01:40 - good clean code we're going to do a nice
01:42 - refactor to replace the Legacy input
01:44 - manager with the brand new input system
01:47 - learning how to refactor is an extremely
01:49 - important and very valuable skill that
01:51 - will massively improve the quality of
01:52 - your code with that then we're going to
01:54 - implement some nice Collision detection
01:56 - to make sure our character doesn't want
01:58 - through walls
01:59 - next we're going to create the very
02:01 - first kitchen counter and make a script
02:03 - to handle how to interact with it then
02:05 - we're going to learn all about c-sharp
02:07 - events and create a proper interact
02:09 - input next we're going to build a
02:11 - selected counter visual which will
02:13 - require us to learn about the extremely
02:15 - useful Singleton pattern with the
02:17 - counters working we're going to start
02:19 - working on the kitchen objects
02:20 - themselves so these are going to be the
02:22 - ingredients and the plates we're going
02:24 - to use scriptable objects to Define all
02:25 - of the types
02:27 - then a very important part of our design
02:29 - is each kitchen object will have to be
02:31 - placed somewhere so we're going to take
02:33 - some time to really think about the best
02:35 - way to achieve that all while riding
02:36 - some good clean code next we're going to
02:38 - enable the player to pick up an object
02:40 - in doing so we're going to learn about
02:42 - c-sharp interfaces then we're going to
02:44 - make a container counter this is from
02:46 - where we can spawn new objects
02:49 - with that we will enable the player to
02:51 - pick up objects and drop them anywhere
02:52 - where there's space
02:54 - then we're going to make the cutting
02:56 - counter this one enables the player to
02:58 - cut an ingredient into slices so to do
03:01 - that we're going to make an alternate
03:02 - interaction
03:04 - and for handling the cutting we're going
03:06 - to once again use script more objects to
03:07 - define a proper cutting recipe
03:09 - then we're going to learn about a really
03:11 - awesome ENT feature we're on canvases
03:13 - and use that to display a nice progress
03:15 - Bar for our cutting progress after that
03:18 - is a quick lecture just going to make a
03:20 - very useful generic script to make any
03:22 - object look at the camera
03:23 - next for another counter we're going to
03:25 - build a trash bin this is where the
03:27 - player can drop objects to destroy them
03:30 - then the stove counter this one is going
03:32 - to be quite a bit complex we're going to
03:34 - create recipes for cooking and for
03:36 - burning we're going to learn how to make
03:38 - a basic state machine and handle timers
03:40 - next we're going to make the plates
03:42 - counter this is a simple encounter that
03:45 - just spawns a bunch of plates
03:46 - after that we're going to make some
03:48 - custom Logic on the plate to be able to
03:50 - hold other objects
03:51 - with that logic working we're going to
03:53 - build a complete visual for all the
03:55 - objects that can exist on the plate then
03:57 - make a nice UI element on the plate
03:59 - itself to showcase the icons of what
04:01 - exactly is on that plate afterwards
04:04 - we're going to make the very last
04:05 - counter the delivery counter this is
04:07 - where we drop the completed plates and
04:10 - in this lecture we're also going to
04:11 - learn about the entity graph and make a
04:13 - quick simple custom Shader then we're
04:16 - going to build the delivery manager
04:17 - class that generates the recipes that
04:19 - the customers are requesting next we're
04:21 - going to build a UI to showcase the
04:23 - wedding recipes after that comes
04:25 - something pretty crucial we're going to
04:27 - add some music and then add some sound
04:29 - effects for all kinds of game actions
04:32 - with that the game won't be almost done
04:34 - so next we're going to build a proper
04:36 - game start and a game end
04:38 - then make a simple main menu and handle
04:40 - scene loading after that hand on
04:42 - creating a basic pause window
04:45 - then make an options menu enable the
04:47 - player to modify the audio levels and
04:49 - rebound keys after that we're going to
04:51 - enable menu navigation with a controller
04:53 - and in the end as usual comes the Polish
04:56 - stage so we're going to add all kinds of
04:58 - small tweaks and effects to make the
04:59 - game feel really great like I've said
05:01 - many times polish is what separates good
05:03 - games from great games after all that we
05:05 - will have our final completed single
05:07 - player game then for the multiplayer
05:09 - course so first we will Begin by taking
05:12 - a brief look at the starting game this
05:14 - is what was made commonly from scratch
05:15 - in the ceiling player course so here
05:17 - we're just going to do a quick overview
05:19 - as a refresher to see how all the code
05:21 - is set up then we're going to begin by
05:22 - installing netcode for game objects this
05:24 - is unity's official multiplayer solution
05:26 - we're going to install the package and
05:28 - do the basic setup with all these
05:30 - settings and spawn a player object after
05:32 - that we're going to begin by
05:33 - synchronizing the player movement and
05:35 - also at this point we're going to talk
05:37 - about one extremely important thing in
05:38 - multiplayer games which is server
05:40 - authoritative versus client
05:42 - authoritative with the movement synced
05:43 - we are then going to synchronize the
05:45 - animations this one is pretty simple to
05:47 - do thanks to the built-in components
05:49 - next we're going to synchronize is our
05:51 - first proper gameplay logic we're going
05:53 - to begin with the delivery manager so
05:56 - we're going to synchronize how the
05:57 - recipes are spawned make sure only the
05:59 - server spawns them and all the clients
06:00 - see the same list and also synchronize
06:03 - delivering the recipes either correctly
06:04 - or incorrectly after that is just a
06:06 - quick lecture to fix the selected
06:08 - countervision this is something that
06:10 - showcases one of the many differences
06:11 - between making single player games and
06:13 - multiplayer games we need to think in
06:15 - different ways especially because in
06:17 - multiplayer we no longer have just a
06:19 - single player object then we're going to
06:21 - synchronize picking up objects this
06:23 - involves learning how to spawn objects
06:24 - on the network so that all of the
06:26 - players can see it after unlearning how
06:27 - to spawn them we're going to synchronize
06:29 - the kitchen object parent so that
06:31 - multiple players can hold objects and
06:33 - everything is correctly synchronized
06:34 - across the network then we're going to
06:36 - synchronize the plates counter make it
06:38 - so that only the server responds points
06:40 - then for the trash counter this one
06:42 - involves learning how to destroy Network
06:44 - objects after that is synchronizing the
06:46 - cutting counter so this one will involve
06:48 - thinking about what parts we need to
06:50 - synchronize eyes and what logic can be
06:51 - just local then for the stove counter
06:54 - for this one instead of using rpcs we're
06:56 - actually going to use a network variable
06:57 - the server won't keep track of the stove
06:59 - State and sync it to the clients next is
07:02 - synchronizing the logic for adding
07:03 - ingredients onto the plates after that
07:06 - for an optional design question we're
07:07 - going to implement some player
07:09 - collisions then we're going to
07:10 - synchronize the complete Game State SO
07:13 - waiting for all of the players to be
07:14 - ready before starting the game and also
07:16 - synchronize the game timer and game over
07:18 - next we're going to learn how to deal
07:20 - with pausing so do we unlock it or not
07:22 - in this case we are going to allow it
07:24 - and all of the other players must wait
07:26 - until everyone is unpaused then for
07:28 - something very important which is how do
07:30 - we handle disconnects how do we clean up
07:32 - all the objects so the game doesn't
07:33 - crash when a player leaves in the middle
07:35 - related to that are only joins so how do
07:37 - we handle a player that joined after the
07:39 - game has already started or should we
07:41 - even allow that then comes a really
07:43 - important and relatively complex lecture
07:45 - in this one we're going to handle the
07:47 - complete connection scene flow how we
07:49 - begin in the main menu in Sim a player
07:51 - then we have an online lobby after that
07:53 - we create the netcode connection and go
07:55 - into the character select scene then
07:57 - when all the players are ready we then
07:58 - go into the main game scene and after
08:01 - that just play the game as normal this
08:02 - is one of the most important lectures in
08:04 - this entire course after that with the
08:06 - connection from we're working we're
08:07 - going to build out a nice character
08:08 - select scene this is one of the main
08:10 - things that I saw people ask about in my
08:12 - netcode video so we're going to make a
08:13 - nice scene where the players can join
08:15 - and customize their character next we're
08:17 - going to build the game lobbying so the
08:19 - player can create a Lobby or Join one
08:21 - then we're going to implement relay in
08:23 - order to allow our players to connect to
08:24 - one another easily without having to
08:26 - open ports next we're going to talk
08:28 - about some more yinty multiplayer Tunes
08:30 - dedicated servers with game server
08:32 - hosting Matchmaker and vvox after that
08:34 - we're going to talk a bit about all of
08:36 - the tools at your disposal to test your
08:38 - multiplayer games then just before the
08:40 - end we're also going to add a really
08:41 - important option we want the game to
08:43 - work in both multiplayer and single
08:45 - player so we're going to make it so you
08:46 - can basically bypass all the multiplier
08:48 - connections and play in an offline
08:50 - single player mode and with that
08:51 - everything is done so we're going to
08:53 - inspect the funnel game and have some
08:54 - fun so as you can see you will learn
08:56 - about a ton of Topics by following these
08:58 - two courses if only you want this just
09:00 - learn how to make single player games
09:01 - and you can just watch that first course
09:03 - but still if you get to the end that one
09:05 - I would encourage you to follow the
09:06 - multiplayer course simply to gain more
09:08 - knowledge and really solidify all those
09:10 - clean code principles the single player
09:12 - course about 10 hours and the
09:14 - multiplayer 1 is about seven if you go
09:16 - through both of them you will gain a ton
09:18 - of knowledge the response to both these
09:20 - cores has been really positive of so I'm
09:21 - very happy with the results if you find
09:23 - the course is helpful there's an
09:25 - optional paid ad free version but
09:27 - there's really nothing different in that
09:28 - version there's nothing behind a paywall
09:30 - so everything here all the lectures all
09:32 - the project files all of it is commonly
09:33 - freeing so only pick up the optional
09:35 - paid version if you find the course
09:37 - helpful and if you can afford it beyond
09:39 - that if you've already seen my two free
09:40 - courses you can check out my other ones
09:42 - I just recently released the 4-3 update
09:45 - to my ultimate TNT overview course which
09:47 - now contains over 16 lectures each
09:49 - covering a different two or more feature
09:50 - of the engine then if you enjoy the
09:52 - focus on clean con principles then a
09:54 - great follow-up is the turn-based
09:56 - strategy course alternatively maybe
09:57 - unlock into visual scripting or learn
10:00 - how to make a builder Defender game so
10:02 - if you want to learn how to make games
10:03 - or improve your already existing skills
10:05 - then check those out alright hope that's
10:07 - useful check out these videos to learn
10:09 - some more thanks to these awesome
10:10 - patreon supporters for making these
10:12 - videos possible thank you for watching
10:14 - and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey a while ago I launched my two free complete courses one is Target that complete beginners on learning how to make a game in unity starting commonly from scratch and the second one starts from where that first one lets off and is on converting that game into multiplayer the project starts coming from scratch and go step by step like your band lecture until the final polish game so here is a quick overview of everything done during those two courses so first of all we're going to start commonly from scratch by selecting a Unity version and creating a brand new project with that new project we will then learn all about the basics of the UNT interface and setup plane layout then the other important part is Visual Studio which is where we're going to be writing all of our code after that comes an extremely important lecture all about coding style in naming rules like I said the code in this course is on the same level of quantity as my Steam games so having proper naming rules and good code sound is Paramount next we're going to download and import all the assets that we're going to use in the course everything is included so you can follow along with every step of the way with yes it's important we're going to set up some quick post processing just to make the game look good then for our first piece of logic we're going to make a simple character controller with that logic working we will then Implement a proper character visual with the included assets next we're going to learn the basics of animation and the animator component and with that we're going to make our player really come alive with some simple but really nice animations then we're going to install the send machine package this isn't actually used too much in this course but I still wanted to include it because it is such a useful tool so I do want you to know about it after that comes another extremely extremely important lecture with regards to writing some good clean code we're going to do a nice refactor to replace the Legacy input manager with the brand new input system learning how to refactor is an extremely important and very valuable skill that will massively improve the quality of your code with that then we're going to implement some nice Collision detection to make sure our character doesn't want through walls next we're going to create the very first kitchen counter and make a script to handle how to interact with it then we're going to learn all about csharp events and create a proper interact input next we're going to build a selected counter visual which will require us to learn about the extremely useful Singleton pattern with the counters working we're going to start working on the kitchen objects themselves so these are going to be the ingredients and the plates we're going to use scriptable objects to Define all of the types then a very important part of our design is each kitchen object will have to be placed
