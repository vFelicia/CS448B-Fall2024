00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm here's
00:02 - an interesting article titled diving
00:03 - into the Nuance of selfin Pros crunch
00:06 - now crunch is definitely a big problem
00:07 - in the industry if you don't know what
00:09 - it means that means when you basically
00:10 - have to work way too much so a regular
00:12 - job is meant to be something like 40
00:14 - hours a week and crunch would be
00:15 - anything that goes above that so it
00:16 - could be 60 hours could be 80 could be
00:18 - all the way up to 100 it is definitely a
00:20 - big problem in the industry because most
00:22 - games right before release there's so
00:23 - much work that needs doing that usually
00:25 - due to either a bad management or way
00:27 - too much scope it ends up with
00:28 - developers having to work 100 hour days
00:30 - in order to hit the release date so it
00:33 - is a big problem in the industry both in
00:34 - AAA but also like it says here something
00:36 - postc crunch for me personally this is
00:38 - definitely something that I've
00:39 - experienced in literally every single
00:40 - game that I've made I would like to say
00:42 - that's not the case but sadly that has
00:43 - been my experience like says on subtitle
00:46 - according to our state of the game
00:47 - industry 23 reports surveying game
00:49 - developers nearly 34s of devs working
00:51 - more than 40 hour weeks said they felt
00:53 - self- pressure to do so so yes this is a
00:55 - big problem that definitely needs to be
00:56 - managed if you crunch on toop at some
00:58 - point you won't burn out and you can't
01:00 - do literally anything so this is the
01:02 - something that even though I sort of
01:03 - fail I sort of end up crunching all the
01:05 - time I actively try to work against it
01:07 - so let's see if this article has some
01:09 - tips on how to make sure it doesn't
01:10 - happen just before that a quick message
01:13 - there's an excellent hble bu right now
01:15 - with a mountain ofets on for just 25
01:17 - bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack
01:19 - like this one then I highly recommend
01:20 - you pick this up anytime you have an
01:22 - idea for a game it is really useful to
01:24 - have a bunch of assets you can easily
01:25 - pick up and use with all these assets
01:27 - you can make tons of really interesting
01:29 - games and if you want to stay up to date
01:31 - with the latest news on Game Dev Tech
01:32 - and gaming then sign up for my gamedev
01:34 - report newsletter if you've seen my
01:36 - videos on that format then the
01:37 - newsletter is really the same idea just
01:39 - text based which lets me do it much more
01:41 - regularly than these big videos so check
01:43 - out both links in the description
01:45 - according to our state of the game
01:46 - industry 23 report about 34s of game
01:48 - developers not that it's self- pressure
01:50 - as the reason they work more than 40
01:52 - hours per week it's by Far and Away the
01:54 - most common answer to the survey
01:55 - question what were the major factors
01:57 - that cause you to work more than 40
01:58 - hours per week with 36% of deaths noting
02:01 - they don't consider their 40 hour plus
02:03 - weeks excessive 40% mentioned feeling
02:06 - direct pressure from management and 11%
02:08 - from their peers everyone else was
02:09 - working those hours yeah I can imagine
02:11 - that is a big problem when working on a
02:13 - regular company where you're working
02:14 - alongside other people even if you
02:16 - yourself want to make sure that you
02:18 - don't crunch want to keep yourself nice
02:19 - and healthy if everyone else is working
02:21 - 80 hours then you can definitely feel
02:23 - quite a bit of pressure even without
02:24 - anyone saying so in order to work those
02:26 - hours many workplaces in the game
02:28 - industry are out andfor terrible
02:30 - practices and inhibit employees from
02:32 - having anything resembling a healthy
02:34 - work life balance which is obviously not
02:36 - okay and those places should be called
02:37 - out those folks in the 40% who said
02:40 - management pressured them and the 11%
02:42 - who noted peer pressure for the hours
02:43 - over 40 deserve better from their hups
02:46 - it's on management to keep peer pressure
02:48 - from money as well yeah work life
02:49 - balance is definitely a very important
02:51 - thing especially if you want to do this
02:52 - for the long term this is something that
02:54 - I pretty much struggle with every time
02:56 - I'm actively trying to work on it but it
02:58 - is quite difficult and it's obviously
02:59 - even more difficult if management is
03:01 - pressuring you directly to do so and
03:03 - also very difficult if just pure
03:05 - pressure no one wants to be seen as the
03:07 - person who isn't essentially carrying
03:08 - their own weight so yep it is definitely
03:10 - up to management in order to make sure
03:11 - everyone just follows the rules just
03:13 - follows the hours that they should be so
03:15 - those are definitely the very
03:16 - problematic part when management or
03:18 - either peer pressure forces you to work
03:19 - but we need to talk about the 74%
03:21 - phenomena I feel this myself as a person
03:23 - with a couple part-time jobs and my own
03:25 - creative practice the need to hustle is
03:27 - real fueled by a complex blend of
03:29 - anxiety if I'm not the best I'll be
03:31 - letting people down and or I'll be fired
03:33 - and put out on the street American
03:34 - Puritan value mythology about hard work
03:37 - Millennial guilt my parents had it much
03:39 - harder than me I need to work for this
03:40 - and somewhere in there I think a genuine
03:42 - desire to make amazing things personally
03:44 - for me my big problem just comes from
03:46 - self-imposed ambition there are so many
03:48 - things that I would love to do and I
03:49 - want to do them as quickly as possible
03:51 - so the idea of taking it slow taking my
03:53 - time and being like okay I'm okay with
03:55 - achieving my goals in 2 years instead of
03:57 - 6 months personally that is my big
03:59 - problem that is where I really fall so
04:00 - for me it is really just based on a
04:02 - general desire to make amazing things
04:04 - and try to make them as quickly as
04:05 - possible that is my problem all these
04:07 - things and more for many of us combine
04:08 - and make some folks feel like no matter
04:10 - how hard we work it's never enough and
04:12 - will never be enough and that attitude
04:14 - is well bad for anyone heal yep I agree
04:16 - if you're at the point where nothing is
04:18 - ever enough that is definitely very
04:19 - unhealthy Behavior if you're crunching
04:21 - non-stop all the time then it's pretty
04:23 - much just a matter of time until you
04:24 - finally burn out and then you can't do
04:26 - anything so you should definitely work
04:27 - hard to avoid that as much as possible
04:30 - there's a side of this that isn't
04:31 - inherently bad at all the desire to make
04:33 - something amazing if you believe
04:34 - strongly in your project your game
04:36 - specifically then what's wrong with
04:37 - putting some extra hours into it what's
04:39 - wrong with letting that passion feel you
04:40 - what's wrong with losing some sleep or
04:42 - straining your relationships in order to
04:44 - make your game the best it can be yeah
04:45 - so this is definitely the part that I
04:47 - can more relate to I've got many things
04:49 - that I would love to do and I want to do
04:50 - them as quickly as possible so yeah I do
04:52 - end up putting extra hours I do let my
04:55 - passion for the things that I want to do
04:56 - I do let that fuel me however one thing
04:58 - I absolutely do not do ever is losing
05:01 - sleep that never works that is a
05:02 - horrible horrible thing for me I always
05:04 - work way too much but I have never
05:06 - really suffered from burnout and I think
05:07 - part of the reason is partly because
05:09 - this I never ever sacrific sleep every
05:11 - single day no matter how many projects I
05:13 - have no matter what deadlines I have I
05:15 - always make sure to sleep at least 8
05:16 - hours so that is one thing that I will
05:18 - not sacrifice and I do believe that is
05:20 - one of the main reasons why I haven't
05:21 - suffered from burnout that and taking
05:23 - care of my physical fitness so for me I
05:24 - love working out I go to the gym every
05:26 - single day that combined with not
05:28 - sacrificing sleep I do think it is the
05:30 - main reason why I've never suffered from
05:31 - barov certainly this is going towards
05:33 - the extreme end and I don't mean to
05:34 - imply that anyone who works say 42 hours
05:37 - in a given week has immediately descend
05:39 - into a dissociative damaged psychotic
05:41 - state from overwork it's not a bad thing
05:42 - to push yourself but it is a bad thing
05:44 - to push yourself too hard for too long
05:46 - and many folks end up learning that the
05:48 - hard way so yep it goes back to that
05:49 - everyone can work let's say 100 hour
05:51 - weeks for one to two weeks but if you do
05:53 - it for months on end yep eventually you
05:54 - won't burn out and then you can't do
05:56 - anything so it is perfectly okay to push
05:58 - yourself too hard to hit a particular
06:00 - deadline if you really want if you
06:01 - really believe in that project and you
06:03 - really want it to be the best it can be
06:04 - but make sure you don't turn it into the
06:06 - just the regular normal way of working
06:08 - like anything else in life balance is
06:10 - necessary for some of us it's Elusive
06:12 - and very easy to slide onto the side of
06:13 - doing too much at the expense of other
06:15 - areas in life I'd be willing to bet that
06:17 - many folks who have been in this
06:18 - industry or probably nearly any industry
06:20 - for more than 10 years have wrecked up
06:22 - their share of horror stories from
06:23 - firsthand experience or from beloved
06:25 - friends and colleagues burnout is real
06:27 - and sometimes self-inflicting yeah like
06:28 - I said this is defin a big problem in
06:30 - the industry I don't think there are any
06:32 - stats specifically about solo inie game
06:34 - developers but I'm pretty sure that I'm
06:35 - not an outlier when I say that I've
06:37 - crunch in pretty much every single one
06:39 - of my games so yeah both in either AAA
06:41 - or just working on a company or working
06:43 - by yourself self-imposed Crunch and
06:45 - burnout are definitely problems that you
06:47 - have to be very aware of it's not easy
06:48 - to recognize at any time in human
06:50 - history let alone for folks working in
06:52 - the throws of late capitalism in the
06:54 - middle of a pandemic that is still very
06:56 - much raging on I certainly can't offer
06:58 - any Brilliant Solutions beyond the usual
06:59 - call for universal healthcare that's
07:01 - inclusive of robust Mental Health
07:03 - Services the availability of healthy
07:05 - Hobbies outside of work and the
07:06 - community building that includes
07:07 - networks of support and Care yeah I
07:09 - agree this is very important taking care
07:11 - of your mental health is just as
07:12 - important as your physical health being
07:14 - able to analyze yourself and figure out
07:16 - okay when am I getting way too stressed
07:17 - at the point that it's unhealthy it is
07:19 - really important to have that
07:20 - self-analysis having healthy Hobbies
07:22 - outside of work like I said for me
07:23 - personally I love the gym so that is my
07:25 - main hobby which really helps it really
07:27 - helps counteract all the time that I
07:28 - spend sitting here and just looking at a
07:30 - screen and community building that
07:31 - includes networks of support and care
07:33 - now for me I'm not much of a social
07:35 - person but if you are then you
07:36 - definitely having a nice support
07:38 - structure having people around you that
07:39 - you can talk to about any issues that
07:41 - can definitely always help there's
07:42 - certainly some hope in the statistics
07:44 - here that only 14% of Dev surveyed
07:46 - mentioned management mandated extra
07:48 - hours and the 11% figure for peer
07:50 - pressure yeah I guess it is good that
07:52 - out of all these people only 30% were
07:54 - essentially being forced to overwork
07:56 - together 70% were doing it to themselves
07:58 - I guess that sort of a silver lining
08:00 - here some of the very real discussion
08:02 - and work that advocates for healthy
08:03 - workplaces is making its way through
08:05 - work culture generally and in our
08:07 - industry we see notes on this in other
08:09 - parts of the survey as well in the great
08:10 - resonation section which shows that 16%
08:12 - developers have left a work environment
08:14 - largely for better work life balance or
08:16 - better benefits so I guess it is good
08:18 - that in the industry there is generally
08:20 - a lack of developers pretty much all the
08:22 - studios they are constantly hiring so
08:23 - technically hopefully that means that
08:25 - all these bad practices all those 30% of
08:28 - people that were forced to work
08:29 - hopefully if there is a shortage of
08:31 - developers the conditions actually
08:32 - improve like I said I work by myself
08:33 - I've never worked in a studio but
08:35 - hopefully this is good for the people
08:36 - actually working in studios of those who
08:38 - said they've changed companies or
08:39 - thought about it the leading factors for
08:41 - a potential switch were salary
08:43 - compensation and Company culture
08:44 - followed by being able to work on a
08:46 - specific project franchise work life
08:47 - balance and having remote workf friendly
08:49 - policies yeah these are all definitely
08:51 - great reasons to look for something
08:52 - different and for solo devs like myself
08:55 - it is also very important to keep track
08:56 - of all of these possible things like for
08:58 - me remote remote work is definitely
09:00 - absolutely essential I don't think I
09:01 - could ever work on a company that does
09:03 - not have remote work the idea of being
09:04 - forced to go through traffic every
09:06 - single day just to reach the office that
09:08 - sounds insane to me but thankfully I
09:10 - don't have to do that work life balance
09:11 - like I said is one of my main challenges
09:13 - I'm constantly trying to work on it and
09:15 - constantly kind of failing but my hopes
09:17 - is that in the long term I will
09:18 - eventually figure out a way to make it
09:20 - work working on a specific project
09:21 - franchise again being a soul windy Dev
09:23 - with a gen love for games thankfully
09:25 - this has never been a problem every game
09:27 - that I've worked on has always been
09:28 - something that I was interested in
09:29 - company culture I'm just by myself so
09:31 - this really isn't applicable to my case
09:33 - and salary compensation I'm obviously
09:35 - always trying to get better always
09:36 - trying to make better games that find
09:37 - more success so yep all these factors
09:39 - yep they are applicable to either
09:41 - working on a company or working by
09:42 - yourself so yeah it's an interesting
09:44 - article and self-impose crunch is
09:45 - definitely a problem both for working in
09:47 - company and working as a solo Indie Dev
09:49 - my best advice to you is what I've said
09:51 - many times which is make sure you don't
09:52 - neglect your physical health if you're a
09:54 - solo indev it can be super easy to just
09:56 - stay sitting on your office and work on
09:58 - your game for 20 hours a day but
10:00 - definitely make sure you don't do that I
10:01 - would highly advise you to not give up
10:03 - on sleep never sacrifice that it never
10:05 - works I would also highly advise you to
10:06 - do anything physical take breaks if you
10:09 - work a 100 hours a week every single
10:11 - week for the rest of life you will
10:12 - eventually burn out and when you do burn
10:14 - out it is really difficult to get back
10:15 - so my advice to you is make sure you
10:17 - don't fall into that trap learn how to
10:18 - analyze yourself learn how to figure out
10:20 - when you need to take a little break and
10:21 - when you do even if there's some wor
10:23 - than he's doing just make sure you take
10:24 - a break whatever you do just avoid going
10:26 - into burnout all right so I hope you
10:28 - found it interesting to hear hear my
10:29 - thoughts on this topic thank you for
10:30 - watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your codm here's an interesting article titled diving into the Nuance of selfin Pros crunch now crunch is definitely a big problem in the industry if you don't know what it means that means when you basically have to work way too much so a regular job is meant to be something like 40 hours a week and crunch would be anything that goes above that so it could be 60 hours could be 80 could be all the way up to 100 it is definitely a big problem in the industry because most games right before release there's so much work that needs doing that usually due to either a bad management or way too much scope it ends up with developers having to work 100 hour days in order to hit the release date so it is a big problem in the industry both in AAA but also like it says here something postc crunch for me personally this is definitely something that I've experienced in literally every single game that I've made I would like to say that's not the case but sadly that has been my experience like says on subtitle according to our state of the game industry 23 reports surveying game developers nearly 34s of devs working more than 40 hour weeks said they felt self pressure to do so so yes this is a big problem that definitely needs to be managed if you crunch on toop at some point you won't burn out and you can't do literally anything so this is the something that even though I sort of fail I sort of end up crunching all the time I actively try to work against it so let's see if this article has some tips on how to make sure it doesn't happen just before that a quick message there's an excellent hble bu right now with a mountain ofets on for just 25 bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack like this one then I highly recommend you pick this up anytime you have an idea for a game it is really useful to have a bunch of assets you can easily pick up and use with all these assets you can make tons of really interesting games and if you want to stay up to date with the latest news on Game Dev Tech and gaming then sign up for my gamedev report newsletter if you've seen my videos on that format then the newsletter is really the same idea just text based which lets me do it much more regularly than these big videos so check out both links in the description according to our state of the game industry 23 report about 34s of game developers not that it's self pressure as the reason they work more than 40 hours per week it's by Far and Away the most common answer to the survey question what were the major factors that cause you to work more

want to keep yourself nice and healthy if everyone else is working 80 hours then you can definitely feel quite a bit of pressure even without anyone saying so in order to work those hours many workplaces in the game industry are out andfor terrible practices and inhibit employees from having anything resembling a healthy work life balance which is obviously not okay and those places should be called out those folks in the 40% who said management pressured them and the 11% who noted peer pressure for the hours over 40 deserve better from their hups it's on management to keep peer pressure from money as well yeah work life balance is definitely a very important thing especially if you want to do this for the long term this is something that I pretty much struggle with every time I'm actively trying to work on it but it is quite difficult and it's obviously even more difficult if management is pressuring you directly to do so and also very difficult if just pure pressure no one wants to be seen as the person who isn't essentially carrying their own weight so yep it is definitely up to management in order to make sure everyone just follows the rules just follows the

a person with a couple parttime jobs and my own creative practice the need to hustle is real fueled by a complex blend of anxiety if I'm not the best I'll be letting people down and or I'll be fired and put out on the street American Puritan value mythology about hard work Millennial guilt my parents had it much harder than me I need to work for this and somewhere in there I think a genuine desire to make amazing things personally for me my big problem just comes from selfimposed ambition there are so many things that I would love to do and I want to do them as quickly as possible so the idea of taking it slow taking my time and being like okay I'm okay with achieving my goals in 2 years instead of 6 months personally that is my big problem that is where I really fall so for me it is really just based on a general desire to make amazing things and try to make them as quickly as possible that is my problem all these things and more for many of us combine and make some folks feel like no matter how hard we work it's never enough and will never be enough and that attitude is well bad for anyone heal yep I agree if you're at the point where nothing is ever enough that is definitely very unhealthy Behavior if you're crunching nonstop all the time then it's pretty much just a matter of time until you finally burn out and then you can't do anything so you should definitely work hard to avoid that as much as possible there's a side of this that isn't inherently bad at all the desire to make something amazing if you believe strongly in your project your game specifically then what's wrong with putting some extra hours into it what's wrong with letting that passion feel you what's wrong with losing some sleep or straining your relationships in order to make your game the best it can be yeah so this is definitely the part that I can more relate to I've got many things that I would love to do and I want to do them as quickly as possible so yeah I do end up putting extra hours I do let my passion for the things that I want to do I do let that fuel me however one thing I absolutely do not do ever is losing sleep that never works that is a horrible horrible thing for me I always work way too much but I have never really suffered from burnout and I think part of the reason is partly because this I never ever sacrific sleep every single day no matter how many projects I have no matter what deadlines I have I always make sure to sleep at least 8 hours so that is one thing that I will not sacrifice and I do believe that is one of the main reasons why I haven't suffered from burnout that and taking care of my physical fitness so for me I love working out I go to the gym every single day that combined with not sacrificing sleep I do think it is the main reason why I've never suffered from barov certainly this is going towards the extreme end and I don't mean to imply that anyone who works say 42 hours in a given week has immediately descend into a dissociative damaged psychotic state from overwork it's not a bad thing to push yourself but it is a bad thing to push yourself too hard for too long and many folks end up

can't do anything so it is perfectly okay to push yourself too hard to hit a particular deadline if you really want if you really believe in that project and you really want it to be the best it can be but make sure you don't turn it into the just the regular normal way of working like anything else in life balance is necessary for some of us it's Elusive and very easy to slide onto the side of

both in either AAA or just working on a company or working by yourself selfimposed Crunch and burnout are definitely problems that you have to be very aware of it's not easy to recognize at any time in human history let alone for folks working in the throws of late capitalism in the middle of a pandemic that is still very much raging on I certainly can't offer any Brilliant Solutions beyond the usual call for universal healthcare that's inclusive of robust Mental Health Services the availability of healthy Hobbies outside of work and the community building that includes networks of support and Care yeah I agree this is very important taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health being able to analyze yourself and figure out okay when am I getting way too stressed at the point that it's unhealthy it is really important to have that selfanalysis having healthy Hobbies outside of work like I said for me personally I love the gym so that is my main hobby which really helps it really helps counteract all the time that I spend sitting here and just looking at a screen and community building that includes networks of support and care now for me I'm not much of a social person but if you are then you definitely having a nice support structure having people around you that you can talk to about any issues that can definitely always help there's certainly some hope in the statistics here that only 14% of Dev surveyed mentioned management mandated extra hours and the 11% figure for peer pressure yeah I guess it is good that out of all these people only 30% were essentially being forced to overwork together 70% were doing it to themselves I guess that sort of a silver lining here some of the very real discussion and work that advocates for healthy workplaces is making its way through work culture generally and in our industry we see notes on this in other parts of the survey as well in the great resonation section which shows that 16% developers have left a work environment largely for better work life balance or better benefits so I guess it is good that in the industry there is generally a lack of developers pretty much all the studios they are constantly hiring so technically hopefully that means that all these bad practices all those 30% of people that were forced to work hopefully if there is a shortage of developers the conditions actually improve like I said I work by myself I've never worked in a studio but hopefully this is good for the people actually working in studios of those who said they've changed companies or thought about it the leading factors for a potential switch were salary compensation and Company culture followed by being able to work on a specific project franchise work life balance and having remote workf friendly policies yeah these are all definitely great reasons to look for something different and for solo devs like myself it is also very important to keep track of all of these possible things like for me remote remote work is definitely absolutely essential I don't think I could ever work on a company that does not have remote work the idea of being forced to go through traffic every single day just to reach the office that sounds insane to me but thankfully I don't have to do that work life balance like I said is one of my main challenges I'm constantly trying to work on it and constantly kind of failing but my hopes is that in the long term I will eventually figure out a way to make it work working on a specific project franchise again being a soul windy Dev with a gen love for games thankfully this has never been a problem every game that I've worked on has always been something that I was interested in company culture I'm just by myself so this really isn't applicable to my case and salary compensation I'm obviously always trying to get better always trying to make better games that find more success so yep all these factors yep they are applicable to either working on a company or working by yourself so yeah it's an interesting article and selfimpose crunch is definitely a problem both for working in company and working as a solo Indie Dev my best advice to you is what I've said many times which is make sure you don't neglect your physical health if you're a solo indev it can be super easy to just stay sitting on your office and work on your game for 20 hours a day but definitely make sure you don't do that I would highly advise you to not give up on sleep never sacrifice that it never works I would also highly advise you to do anything physical take breaks if you work a 100 hours a week every single week for the rest of life you will eventually burn out and when you do burn out it is really difficult to get back so my advice to you is make sure you don't fall into that trap learn how to analyze yourself learn how to figure out when you need to take a little break and when you do even if there's some wor than he's doing just make sure you take a break whatever you do just avoid going into burnout all right so I hope you found it interesting to hear hear my thoughts on this topic thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
