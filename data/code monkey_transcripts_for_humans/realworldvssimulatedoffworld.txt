00:00 - here is the real world and here is the
00:02 - simulated offworld the dink is in
00:04 - machines those are gathering resources
00:06 - and consuming power all the same actions
00:08 - on both representations of the world are
00:09 - being taken but on this one as you can
00:11 - see it has no visuals so this one just
00:13 - has visuals for debugging with this
00:14 - logic I can now fly to another planet
00:16 - and while I'm on this planet the
00:18 - simulation of the first world is still
00:19 - running as you can see I'm periodically
00:21 - receiving resource from that first world
00:23 - based on that actual simulation then I
00:25 - can get back to the original World and
00:27 - see the brand new state if you like
00:28 - automation Colony building games then go
00:30 - ahead dinky Gardens your wishlist
