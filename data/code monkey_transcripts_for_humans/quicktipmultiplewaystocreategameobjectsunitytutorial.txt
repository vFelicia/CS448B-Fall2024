00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - create game objects so let's say you
00:06 - need to create a game object through
00:08 - code that you need to do something like
00:10 - play a sound you can simply do new game
00:13 - object and use it just like this however
00:18 - if you do it like this the game object
00:20 - will have a default name which will make
00:22 - it very difficult to find in your
00:23 - hierarchy so here as you can see I have
00:29 - ten game objects and they all have the
00:31 - exact same name so if I was trying to
00:33 - debug some error in my code it would be
00:35 - very difficult to find the game object
00:37 - that I'm looking for so whenever you do
00:39 - create a new game object always look at
00:41 - the second constructor which allows you
00:43 - to put a name and just like that each
00:49 - game object now has a unique name and we
00:51 - can easily find it in our scene
00:52 - something else you might want to do is
00:55 - create a game object with various
00:56 - components so again you could do it the
00:59 - normal way game object and then do game
01:01 - object that add component and that
01:02 - whatever you need and again this works
01:07 - perfectly fine but if we see on our game
01:10 - object you can see that we have a third
01:12 - constructor which allows us to specify
01:14 - the components that we want that game
01:16 - object to have so in here we can simply
01:18 - do and give the type of sprite renderer
01:21 - and a type of unit and just like that
01:25 - our game object won't be instantiated
01:26 - with these two components so it is all
01:29 - of our game objects now have the sprite
01:31 - renderer and the unit component and
01:33 - that's it hope you found this tip useful
01:35 - alright see you next time
