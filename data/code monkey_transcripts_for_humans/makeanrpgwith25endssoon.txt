01:14 - that's always a nice bonus
01:16 - let's inspect some of these assets to

01:22 - of these regarding urp so make sure you

01:31 - assets list just go into your unt id and
01:34 - select your organization then you can
01:36 - manually assign seats for each asset
01:39 - also there's timestamps in the video if
01:40 - you want to skip ahead to a particular
01:42 - asset or tool
01:43 - okay so the main one is of course the
01:45 - rpg builder it's a massive tool for
01:48 - letting you easily build out just about
01:49 - anything you could possibly need in
01:51 - making an rpg the original price is 180
01:54 - dollars so that's why i said if just a
01:56 - single one of these looks interesting
01:57 - then the home bundle is worth it it
01:59 - really has all of the features you can
02:01 - think of so you can make some characters
02:03 - factions items loot drafts crafting
02:05 - enemies quests and tons more
02:07 - this is a pretty complex tool but they
02:09 - do have some very good very detailed
02:11 - documentation with tons of tutorial
02:13 - videos
02:14 - so make sure you watch that in order to
02:15 - learn how to use it here let's try out
02:17 - the demo scene
02:19 - first up you start off on the main menu
02:20 - and you have the ability to make a new
02:22 - character or continue so it already has
02:24 - a save and load system when you make a
02:26 - new character and up here you can select
02:28 - the various races so by default there's
02:29 - all human then you've got a bunch of
02:31 - stats and some points that you can add
02:33 - you also have a bunch of interesting
02:35 - game modifiers so tons of interesting
02:37 - systems then you type in your name
02:39 - select your gender and hit on create and
02:41 - you see the unloading screen also has a
02:43 - nice image shows the progress on the
02:45 - bottom and so on and then yep here's the
02:47 - demo with some really simple nice
02:48 - controls the developer is very active on
02:51 - discord so if you have any issues just
02:52 - go there and ask any questions then yep
02:55 - here is the demo so i got my character
02:57 - that i can move around i can jump
02:59 - then you've got a skill hotbar at the
03:01 - bottom with all kinds of abilities so i
03:03 - can do a real nice fireball another one
03:05 - that is a frostbolt i can even spawn a
03:08 - companion
03:09 - then over here is an npc i can approach
03:11 - i can talk to him there's a nice dialog
03:13 - system so as something says something
03:15 - there's also a really nice sprint so it
03:18 - zooms the camera and makes the character
03:19 - go faster pretty nice
03:21 - then all kinds of weapons here so just
03:23 - approach look at the weapon pick it up
03:25 - and now i can open up the character
03:27 - window as well as the inventory and with
03:29 - some basic drag and drop i can simply
03:31 - equip the weapon there it is also a
03:33 - really nice tooltip so with my staff i
03:35 - know i have a basic attack that i can
03:36 - use
03:38 - over here is a table for doing some
03:39 - anchovy so mix up a bunch of recipes and
03:41 - get a bunch of items
03:43 - then this npc here with the exclamation
03:45 - point so he's got a quest for me so i
03:46 - can see see all the quests accepted see
03:48 - what i have to do any rewards and so on
03:50 - then up here some dummy just to test out
03:52 - all these skills on things and
03:54 - everything there's also a nice working
03:56 - mini map up there on the corner
03:58 - there's also resources scattered
04:00 - throughout the world so there's a nice
04:01 - system for approaching resources and
04:03 - simply gathering them
04:04 - then you can go into combat and the
04:06 - enemies have got some nice ai i can also
04:08 - apply all kinds of debuffs to them so
04:10 - that one is now frozen
04:12 - when the enemies die they obviously drop
04:14 - some loot and then there's also some
04:16 - resources that you can simply mine so
04:18 - just on this demo you can already see
04:19 - just how capable this is just how many
04:21 - features that has by the way if you find
04:24 - the video helpful please hit the like
04:25 - button it's a tiny thing but it really
04:27 - does help thanks now in the editor the
04:29 - main window is up here on blink open up
04:31 - the rpg builder
04:32 - now one quick note here normally i use
04:34 - unity on the light skin but it doesn't
04:36 - work very well with this window so the
04:38 - text over there is in black so i can
04:39 - really read it there is an option to
04:41 - change it from dark mode into light but
04:44 - it still causes all kinds of issues so
04:45 - for example as you browse around there
04:47 - are some buttons that have a black
04:49 - background so this tool is really meant
04:50 - to be used in dark mode and also another
04:53 - note which is over here i'm using the
04:55 - built-in render pipeline
04:56 - now this is a tool so render pipelines
04:59 - aren't really relevant for the tool
05:00 - itself just for the included demo
05:02 - some of the materials used in this demo
05:04 - they can be upgraded automatically but
05:05 - some cannot because they use some custom
05:07 - shaders
05:08 - so do keep that in mind that you can
05:10 - definitely use the tool using anything
05:12 - since it's just a tool but when you want
05:14 - to try out the demo make sure you're
05:15 - using the built-in render pipeline just
05:16 - to make things easier
05:18 - okay so on this window you can build out
05:20 - everything you can click up here on the
05:22 - icon to see the main menu and see each
05:24 - individual menu so for example if you go
05:26 - into combat and click here and go and
05:28 - see all the various things so for
05:30 - example how would you make a new enemy
05:32 - well you would go into combat then over
05:33 - here into npcs and then on these buttons
05:36 - here you can either create a brand new
05:38 - one completely from scratch or you can
05:40 - just go to one of these preset ones
05:42 - let's say the skeleton soldier and just
05:43 - hit on duplicate and there you go it
05:45 - creates a new copy and now you've got
05:47 - all kinds of things that you can change
05:49 - so you can give it a completely
05:50 - different name you can give it a
05:52 - different icon
05:53 - and over here you've got the prefab
05:54 - setup so this is what will actually have
05:56 - the visual for your new enemy then
05:58 - you've got the avatar the animated
06:00 - controller and so on then under combat
06:02 - you can define all kinds of factions so
06:04 - what faction does this enemy belong to
06:06 - you define all kinds of abilities aggro
06:08 - links respawn and overheating loot table
06:10 - so what's this drop a bunch of stats
06:12 - movement and so on so as you can see
06:14 - tons of things you can play around with
06:15 - to make each enemy really unique just
06:17 - one thing which is when you make some
06:19 - changes make sure you hit on save so as
06:21 - you can see this tone is super easy to
06:22 - use and over here you've got all kinds
06:24 - of things that you can do for example
06:25 - abilities make a bunch more abilities
06:27 - change these around then over here for
06:29 - the factions so add some more change how
06:31 - they interact each other so for example
06:34 - humans are hated by the animals but they
06:36 - are neutral against critters then in the
06:38 - main menu you can go and change all
06:40 - kinds of world settings search them over
06:42 - here on the quest change all kinds of
06:43 - quests that you have
06:45 - define some tasks to be done some
06:46 - resource nodes set up some dialogue
06:49 - which by itself already has a real nice
06:51 - download window so again just click and
06:53 - drag and you can make all kinds of
06:54 - interactions so as you can see pretty
06:56 - much every single rpg element that you
06:58 - can think of this tool can definitely do
07:00 - it and one of the main selling points is
07:02 - you can do all this without having to
07:03 - write a single line of code now for me i
07:06 - love programming so that doesn't really
07:07 - appeal to me but i could definitely see
07:09 - this as being super useful for very
07:11 - quickly making a prototype and testing
07:13 - out some specific idea so that's the rpg
07:15 - builder if you take the time to learn
07:17 - this tool it can be massively useful
07:19 - then for some assets here's a pack with
07:21 - a bunch of characters all of them with a
07:23 - bunch of animations included so one of
07:25 - these could be your player or maybe your
07:27 - enemies here i've got the pack imported
07:29 - into my project now as usual let's start
07:31 - off working with the built-in render
07:32 - pipeline so right now i'm using urp
07:35 - so for this pack you can run the
07:36 - automatic updater so just go here update
07:39 - the project materials
07:40 - and now some of these update
07:41 - automatically and some do not now the
07:43 - reason is because they are using some
07:45 - kind of legacy shader that does not
07:47 - automatically get converted so it's
07:49 - using the standard double sided which
07:50 - for some reason apparently urp doesn't
07:52 - know how to upgrade that one but this is
07:54 - an easy fix you can just manually change
07:56 - into the standard shader do it for all
07:58 - of these ones
07:59 - so just put them all on the standard and
08:01 - now run the upgrade again and there you
08:03 - go now all the characters so here you
08:05 - can see a bunch of great looking
08:07 - characters and all of them got some nice
08:09 - animations as well as a bunch of nice
08:11 - weapons alright so these look pretty
08:13 - great now there is another pack with
08:15 - just one very high end character also
08:17 - with animations now this one the demo is
08:19 - actually made to work with agrp so on
08:21 - the console you might see a bunch of
08:23 - errors but if you're using urp those
08:25 - shaders are also included all you have
08:27 - to do is manually change them so go
08:29 - through all the materials and then up
08:31 - here instead of using the clothing
08:32 - shader hdrp
08:34 - just go into the same one so the dawn
08:35 - shader urp and then up here replace for
08:38 - the urp so just apply that and manually
08:40 - change all the shaders for the urp
08:42 - version
08:47 - so just change them all and also this
08:49 - scene since it's made to work with hrp
08:51 - all of the lights are very intense so
08:54 - you can just disable these lights and on
08:56 - directional light set it to much less
08:58 - and yep so here is the demo with the
09:00 - only working character
09:02 - so as you can see this one the demo
09:03 - contains a bunch of cloth a bunch of
09:05 - animation so everything looks pretty
09:06 - nice it's a bunch of enemies both with a
09:08 - staff as well as a bow
09:10 - and then all kinds of variations that
09:12 - you can apply to this character so again
09:14 - also a great looking high-end character
09:16 - for some more tools another excellent
09:17 - one that is also included is the odin
09:19 - inspector now i actually did a full
09:22 - review on the odin inspector quite a
09:23 - while ago go check out that video if you
09:25 - want to learn some more about it
09:27 - essentially it's a tool for helping you
09:29 - make your own tools which can then help
09:31 - you be massively more efficient as
09:32 - you're making your game it's absolutely
09:34 - excellent and super easy to use so again
09:37 - i think the home bundle is worth it just
09:38 - for that one so if you don't have it yet
09:40 - then this is the best opportunity to get
09:42 - it
09:43 - again go check out my review video to
09:45 - learn some more and then that video also
09:47 - includes a quick getting start guide so
09:48 - you can see just how easy it is to use
09:51 - for some environment there's a bunch of
09:52 - interesting ones so there's these
09:54 - modular houses they work great with urp
09:56 - without any issues here is the demo
09:58 - scene with all kinds of houses all of
10:00 - them look pretty great and they're all
10:02 - made up of individual modular pieces
10:04 - and the demo scene also has a real nice
10:06 - background so all those mountains look
10:07 - really cool so this would be a great
10:09 - starting environment for any kind of
10:11 - game you want to try out and since this
10:12 - whole thing is made up of modular pieces
10:15 - for example a while ago i covered the
10:17 - house building system
10:18 - so you can download the project files
10:20 - for that video and use them with these
10:21 - modular pieces so just grab one of these
10:23 - walls make them into objects and then
10:24 - build your own houses another great
10:26 - environment is the mountain trees pack
10:29 - this one supports all the render
10:30 - pipelines so inside the asset you've got
10:33 - the various unity packages for agrp or
10:35 - urp
10:36 - and yeah this one has some really good
10:38 - looking trees so some with a bunch of
10:40 - snow
10:41 - some really with tons of snow and some
10:43 - of them that look pretty normal
10:45 - and as you can see the trees themselves
10:46 - look very very good and of course they
10:48 - also have a wind shader so there is a
10:50 - nice way to them so if you have an rpg
10:53 - game idea that takes place in the forest
10:55 - then this one would be a great starting
10:56 - asset or maybe if your game id involves
10:59 - a castle this pack is awesome
11:01 - also supports urping this one looks
11:04 - really great really awesome and there's
11:06 - tons and tons of assets all of them
11:07 - really high quality so you can browse
11:09 - around see you've got a bunch of insides
11:11 - a bunch of outside scenes of them
11:13 - looking really great so yep this is
11:15 - another awesome pack so you can see just
11:17 - how big it is just how many things it
11:19 - contains really awesome
11:21 - and once again this demo scene would be
11:22 - awesome just to import it and there you
11:24 - go you've got a real nice environment to
11:26 - test out your next game idea another
11:28 - interesting tool is dream text splines
11:30 - so it lets you very easily create all
11:32 - kinds of splines now if you don't know
11:34 - about splines or bezier curves i
11:36 - actually cover them in detail in another
11:38 - video they are super useful and what i
11:40 - covered in that video is really just the
11:41 - basics so what this asset does is it
11:44 - takes that and it builds upon it so
11:45 - whenever you need to design some path
11:47 - for something like maybe the trajectory
11:49 - of a ball or maybe the path for the
11:51 - camera to follow in those cases splines
11:53 - are insanely useful
11:55 - and of course if you want to dynamically
11:56 - generate some meshes like some curved
11:58 - roads well splines are perfect for just
12:00 - that
12:01 - there's also tons of ui elements with
12:03 - this pack it's got all kinds of
12:05 - different buttons a bunch of sliders a
12:07 - bunch of toggles
12:08 - then you also have all kinds of frames
12:10 - with some really good art a bunch of
12:12 - icons
12:13 - some more sliders health bars a joystick
12:15 - then tons and tons of icons a demo for a
12:18 - main menu then we're for a downloading
12:20 - scene and so on also included in the
12:22 - bundle is a cloud system works on all of
12:24 - the render pipelines it can make some
12:27 - really good looking clouds and they are
12:28 - also very performant so that's already
12:31 - tons of stuff but there's quite a lot
12:32 - more in the bundle
12:34 - for example you've got a pack for some
12:35 - mobile tools
12:37 - so this one helps you integrate some ads
12:39 - achievements leaderboards and so on
12:41 - there's also a bunch of them with some
12:42 - sound effects so a fantasy ambient sound
12:45 - effect pack
12:46 - and up here another one with some
12:47 - fantasy sounds there's also another rpg
12:50 - builder here i haven't tried this one
12:52 - yet but also looks very capable if
12:54 - you've got a bunch more environments
12:56 - a bunch of low polytone so this bundle
12:58 - is excellent there's also a more
13:00 - advanced console congratuator a bunch of
13:02 - visual tools
13:04 - and also a bunch of games for you to
13:05 - play so yeah that's tons of awesome
13:07 - stuff you can get for a very low price
13:09 - like i said if just a single one of
13:11 - these looks interesting then the home
13:12 - bundle is worth it personally i would
13:14 - say if you don't have odin yet then
13:16 - definitely get it just for that one i
13:18 - made a phone review video with a getting
13:20 - started guide so you can see exactly
13:21 - what that asset can do and just how much
13:23 - it can help you this is also a pretty
13:25 - quick deal ends in only a few days so if
13:27 - you're interested definitely go ahead
13:28 - and get it now all right hope that's
13:30 - useful check out these videos to learn
13:32 - some more thanks to these awesome
13:34 - patreon supporters for making these
13:35 - videos possible thank you for watching
13:38 - and i'll see you next time

asset or tool okay so the main one is of course the rpg builder it's a massive tool for letting you easily build out just about anything you could possibly need in making an rpg the original price is 180 dollars so that's why i said if just a single one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it it really has all of the features you can think of so you can make some characters factions items loot drafts crafting enemies quests and tons more this is a pretty complex tool but they do have some very good very detailed documentation with tons of tutorial videos so make sure you watch that in order to learn how to use it here let's try out the demo scene first up you start off on the main menu and you have the ability to make a new character or continue so it already has a save and load system when you make a new character and up here you can select the various races so by default there's all human then you've got a bunch of stats and some points that you can add you also have a bunch of interesting game modifiers so tons of interesting systems then you type in your name select your gender and hit on create and you see the unloading screen also has a nice image shows the progress on the bottom and so on and then yep here's the demo with some really simple nice controls the developer is very active on discord so if you have any issues just go there and ask any questions then yep here is the demo so i got my character that i can move around i can jump then you've got a skill hotbar at the bottom with all kinds of abilities so i can do a real nice fireball another one that is a frostbolt i can even spawn a companion then over here is an npc i can approach i can talk to him there's a nice dialog system so as something says something there's also a really nice sprint so it zooms the camera and makes the character go faster pretty nice then all kinds of weapons here so just approach look at the weapon pick it up and now i can open up the character window as well as the inventory and with some basic drag and drop i can simply equip the weapon there it is also a really nice tooltip so with my staff i know i have a basic attack that i can use over here is a table for doing some anchovy so mix up a bunch of recipes and get a bunch of items then this npc here with the exclamation point so he's got a quest for me so i can see see all the quests accepted see what i have to do any rewards and so on then up here some dummy just to test out all these skills on things and everything there's also a nice working mini map up there on the corner there's also resources scattered throughout the world so there's a nice system for approaching resources and simply gathering them then you can go into combat and the enemies have got some nice ai i can also apply all kinds of debuffs to them so that one is now frozen when the enemies die they obviously drop some loot and then there's also some resources that you can simply mine so just on this demo you can already see just how capable this is just how many features that has by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks now in the editor the main window is up here on blink open up the rpg builder now one quick note here normally i use unity on the light skin but it doesn't work very well with this window so the text over there is in black so i can really read it there is an option to change it from dark mode into light but it still causes all kinds of issues so for example as you browse around there are some buttons that have a black background so this tool is really meant to be used in dark mode and also another note which is over here i'm using the builtin render pipeline now this is a tool so render pipelines aren't really relevant for the tool itself just for the included demo some of the materials used in this demo they can be upgraded automatically but some cannot because they use some custom shaders so do keep that in mind that you can definitely use the tool using anything since it's just a tool but when you want to try out the demo make sure you're using the builtin render pipeline just to make things easier okay so on this window you can build out everything you can click up here on the icon to see the main menu and see each individual menu so for example if you go into combat and click here and go and see all the various things so for example how would you make a new enemy well you would go into combat then over here into npcs and then on these buttons here you can either create a brand new one completely from scratch or you can just go to one of these preset ones let's say the skeleton soldier and just hit on duplicate and there you go it creates a new copy and now you've got all kinds of things that you can change so you can give it a completely different name you can give it a different icon and over here you've got the prefab setup so this is what will actually have the visual for your new enemy then you've got the avatar the animated controller and so on then under combat you can define all kinds of factions so what faction does this enemy belong to you define all kinds of abilities aggro links respawn and overheating loot table so what's this drop a bunch of stats movement and so on so as you can see tons of things you can play around with to make each enemy really unique just one thing which is when you make some changes make sure you hit on save so as you can see this tone is super easy to use and over here you've got all kinds of things that you can do for example abilities make a bunch more abilities change these around then over here for the factions so add some more change how they interact each other so for example humans are hated by the animals but they are neutral against critters then in the main menu you can go and change all kinds of world settings search them over here on the quest change all kinds of quests that you have define some tasks to be done some resource nodes set up some dialogue which by itself already has a real nice download window so again just click and drag and you can make all kinds of interactions so as you can see pretty much every single rpg element that you can think of this tool can definitely do it and one of the main selling points is you can do all this without having to write a single line of code now for me i love programming so that doesn't really appeal to me but i could definitely see this as being super useful for very quickly making a prototype and testing out some specific idea so that's the rpg builder if you take the time to learn this tool it can be massively useful then for some assets here's a pack with a bunch of characters all of them with a bunch of animations included so one of these could be your player or maybe your enemies here i've got the pack imported into my project now as usual let's start off working with the builtin render pipeline so right now i'm using urp so for this pack you can run the automatic updater so just go here update the project materials and now some of these update automatically and some do not now the reason is because they are using some kind of legacy shader that does not automatically get converted so it's using the standard double sided which for some reason apparently urp doesn't know how to upgrade that one but this is an easy fix you can just manually change into the standard shader do it for all of these ones so just put them all on the standard and now run the upgrade again and there you go now all the characters so here you can see a bunch of great looking characters and all of them got some nice animations as well as a bunch of nice weapons alright so these look pretty great now there is another pack with just one very high end character also with animations now this one the demo is actually made to work with agrp so on the console you might see a bunch of errors but if you're using urp those shaders are also included all you have to do is manually change them so go through all the materials and then up here instead of using the clothing shader hdrp just go into the same one so the dawn shader urp and then up here replace for the urp so just apply that and manually change all the shaders for the urp version so just change them all and also this scene since it's made to work with hrp all of the lights are very intense so you can just disable these lights and on directional light set it to much less and yep so here is the demo with the only working character so as you can see this one the demo contains a bunch of cloth a bunch of animation so everything looks pretty nice it's a bunch of enemies both with a staff as well as a bow and then all kinds of variations that you can apply to this character so again also a great looking highend character for some more tools another excellent one that is also included is the odin inspector now i actually did a full review on the odin inspector quite a while ago go check out that video if you want to learn some more about it essentially it's a tool for helping you make your own tools which can then help you be massively more efficient as you're making your game it's absolutely excellent and super easy to use so again i think the home bundle is worth it just for that one so if you don't have it yet then this is the best opportunity to get it again go check out my review video to learn some more and then that video also includes a quick getting start guide so you can see just how easy it is to use for some environment there's a bunch of interesting ones so there's these modular houses they work great with urp without any issues here is the demo scene with all kinds of houses all of them look pretty great and they're all made up of individual modular pieces and the demo scene also has a real nice background so all those mountains look really cool so this would be a great starting environment for any kind of game you want to try out and since this whole thing is made up of modular pieces for example a while ago i covered the house building system so you can download the project files for that video and use them with these modular pieces so just grab one of these walls make them into objects and then build your own houses another great environment is the mountain trees pack this one supports all the render pipelines so inside the asset you've got the various unity packages for agrp or urp and yeah this one has some really good looking trees so some with a bunch of snow some really with tons of snow and some of them that look pretty normal and as you can see the trees themselves look very very good and of course they also have a wind shader so there is a nice way to them so if you have an rpg game idea that takes place in the forest then this one would be a great starting asset or maybe if your game id involves a castle this pack is awesome also supports urping this one looks really great really awesome and there's tons and tons of assets all of them really high quality so you can browse around see you've got a bunch of insides a bunch of outside scenes of them looking really great so yep this is another awesome pack so you can see just how big it is just how many things it contains really awesome and once again this demo scene would be awesome just to import it and there you go you've got a real nice environment to test out your next game idea another interesting tool is dream text splines so it lets you very easily create all kinds of splines now if you don't know about splines or bezier curves i actually cover them in detail in another video they are super useful and what i covered in that video is really just the basics so what this asset does is it takes that and it builds upon it so whenever you need to design some path for something like maybe the trajectory of a ball or maybe the path for the camera to follow in those cases splines are insanely useful and of course if you want to dynamically generate some meshes like some curved roads well splines are perfect for just that there's also tons of ui elements with this pack it's got all kinds of different buttons a bunch of sliders a bunch of toggles then you also have all kinds of frames with some really good art a bunch of icons some more sliders health bars a joystick then tons and tons of icons a demo for a main menu then we're for a downloading scene and so on also included in the bundle is a cloud system works on all of the render pipelines it can make some really good looking clouds and they are also very performant so that's already tons of stuff but there's quite a lot more in the bundle for example you've got a pack for some mobile tools so this one helps you integrate some ads achievements leaderboards and so on there's also a bunch of them with some sound effects so a fantasy ambient sound effect pack and up here another one with some fantasy sounds there's also another rpg builder here i haven't tried this one yet but also looks very capable if you've got a bunch more environments a bunch of low polytone so this bundle is excellent there's also a more advanced console congratuator a bunch of visual tools and also a bunch of games for you to play so yeah that's tons of awesome stuff you can get for a very low price like i said if just a single one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it personally i would say if you don't have odin yet then definitely get it just for that one i made a phone review video with a getting started guide so you can see exactly what that asset can do and just how much it can help you this is also a pretty quick deal ends in only a few days so if you're interested definitely go ahead and get it now all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
