00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to learn
00:04 - how to take screenshot in unity we're
00:06 - going to grab the pixels from a specific
00:08 - camera and save them into a PNG we can
00:11 - grab the entire screen from the main
00:12 - camera or grab the view of a secondary
00:14 - camera let's it's our
00:20 - so let's start off by creating a new
00:23 - c-sharp script and name it screenshot
00:27 - handler so in here on our private void
00:32 - awake we're going to grab a reference to
00:35 - the camera that this script will be
00:36 - placed on so up here first private
00:40 - camera my camera and on away my camera
00:45 - equal game logic key component of time
00:49 - we're also going to make a static
00:52 - instance so we can trigger screenshots
00:53 - through a static function so a private
00:56 - static screenshot handler instance and
01:00 - down here okay so let's make a private
01:06 - void take screenshots and in here we're
01:10 - going to receive the image for our width
01:12 - and then for our height which will be
01:15 - the size of our final image now in order
01:19 - to grab the screenshot image we need to
01:21 - capture it after the current frame has
01:23 - been rendered so we're going to use the
01:24 - monobehaviour function on post render so
01:27 - private void on post render now this is
01:33 - going to trigger every frame so we need
01:35 - a boolean to flag when we want to
01:36 - capture a frame so up here came to make
01:40 - a private ball take screenshot on next
01:44 - frame and on our trick take screenshot
01:47 - we're going to set it to true and then
01:50 - here it is true we're going to take our
01:53 - screenshot and set it to false now on
01:58 - our screen shot we're going to create a
02:00 - render texture and apply it to our
02:02 - camera so my camera dot target texture
02:06 - equals a new render texture dot gets a
02:10 - temporary texture with this with this
02:13 - height and a depth of 16 so we have some
02:16 - transparency so in here the reason we're
02:18 - using a render texture is so that we can
02:21 - take a screenshot of various widths and
02:24 - Heights without having to be exactly the
02:26 - size of our screen by setting the target
02:30 - texture we're directing this camera
02:32 - we're into this texture rather than the
02:34 - screen with the size of this texture now
02:39 - on our post render we're going to grab
02:41 - the renderer with read pixels so let's
02:46 - grab a reference to our render texture
02:49 - and the texture equals my camera dot
02:52 - target texture
02:54 - let's create a new texture 2d to hold
02:58 - our data so texture 2d render result
03:03 - equals new texture 2d we're going to
03:06 - grade with the same size as our render
03:08 - texture width thanks your dot height
03:13 - with a texture format of a RGB 32 so we
03:18 - have transparency and we don't need mid
03:22 - Maps so now down here let's create a
03:25 - rectangle start on 0 0 and go film
03:34 - renderer picture that would render
03:36 - texture dot height and finally on our
03:42 - render result we can use read pixels to
03:46 - read our rectangle on to our destination
03:49 - of 0 and 0 so now we have our texture
03:53 - with the correct image that we want so
03:55 - let's save it into a PNG going to create
03:59 - a byte array out byte array and it's
04:04 - going to be our render result dot encode
04:08 - to PNG then we're going to use system
04:12 - darío dot file dot right all bytes we're
04:19 - going to write our byte array into
04:23 - application that that a path was let's
04:27 - call it camera screenshot dot PNG and
04:32 - what a long
04:35 - so that we know our screen shot has been
04:39 - saved and finally going to run their
04:44 - texture and release power temporary and
04:53 - back into my camera set the target
04:55 - texture back to not okay so when our
04:59 - flag is set we reset the flag we grab
05:02 - the render texture that we added in here
05:04 - we create a new texture to deal with the
05:07 - size that we want with transparency we
05:11 - create a rectangle of the form texture
05:13 - which is what we want to read we read
05:16 - based on that rectangle into that
05:17 - texture 2d then we encode that texture
05:20 - TD into PNG bytes and we save that byte
05:23 - array into our file and finally we do
05:27 - our cleanup okay so let's make our
05:30 - static function to take this screenshot
05:33 - from elsewhere in our code so a public
05:36 - static void take screenshot make it
05:40 - static and we're going to take our with
05:45 - a name for a height and we're going to
05:48 - do instant stock take screenshot of the
05:50 - width and our height and now in here on
05:56 - our game handler we're going to add on
05:59 - our update just for testing let's do if
06:02 - input dot get key down let's say equal
06:07 - dot space when we hit space we're going
06:11 - to do screenshot handler dot take
06:15 - screenshot let's take a 500 by 500
06:18 - screenshot okay let's go back into our
06:21 - scene here and I have my main camera in
06:24 - here and I'm going to add the screenshot
06:26 - handler onto it
06:27 - now let's it play okay I have my camera
06:31 - here and when I press space there you go
06:33 - the log says it save the screenshot we
06:36 - can update and see our screenshot right
06:37 - here there you it rendered that camera
06:40 - into this image it's not what we're
06:44 - doing here is not necessarily just
06:45 - taking a screenshot but rather taking
06:47 - the
06:47 - which from a specific camera so I have a
06:50 - secondary camera right here on top of
06:52 - the player and in my scene I have some
06:56 - text right download the player this text
06:58 - is on a different layer which is not
07:00 - being rendered by this main camera but
07:03 - it's being rendered by this player
07:04 - camera
07:05 - this player camera is essentially
07:07 - functioning as a portrait view so we can
07:09 - use our commands to grab the view from
07:11 - this camera without affecting what the
07:15 - main camera actually sees so let's
07:18 - remove the screenshot handler from the
07:19 - main camera and apply it to our player
07:22 - camera hit play and right now my main
07:26 - camera still shows exactly the same
07:28 - thing but when I hit space you can see
07:31 - that the camera screenshot is a result
07:33 - of the other camera great ok so as you
07:39 - can see you can use this script to grab
07:41 - a portrait of a camera or set up a
07:43 - camera different from what is being
07:45 - shown on the main camera and since we're
07:47 - saving as a PNG we can also grab
07:49 - transparency so what's going here back
07:52 - into our scene and let's erase our
07:55 - background sprites and now it should
07:58 - save a transparent image here I have my
08:02 - player as usual the main camera is being
08:04 - rendered and my secondary camera has
08:08 - grabbed this image with a transparent
08:10 - background sorry oh you can see how you
08:13 - can use this to either take regular
08:15 - screenshots of the entire screen or use
08:17 - it to grab the image from a secondary
08:19 - camera showing something completely
08:21 - different in your game okay I hope that
08:24 - helps if you have any questions post
08:26 - them in the comments and I'll do my best
08:27 - to answer them ok see you next time
08:39 - you
