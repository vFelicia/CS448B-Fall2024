00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're going to view a
00:03 - summary of the governor AI series let's
00:05 - begin
00:08 - so the goal in this series is to make a
00:11 - gather unit with the AI to gather
00:12 - resources of various types and drop them
00:14 - off at a storage the gatherer can be
00:16 - player controlled but he also thinks for
00:18 - himself and looks for resources together
00:19 - then in the end we will take everything
00:22 - and make a nice simple ecosystem where
00:24 - we gather resources to construct a tower
00:26 - which in turn spawns a new gatherer that
00:28 - can gather more resources and so on so
00:30 - first we're going to start with just one
00:32 - gatherer a gold node and a storage we're
00:34 - going to make together to go towards the
00:36 - node play a mining animation go towards
00:38 - the storage and repeat together we'll
00:40 - have a simple state machine to handle
00:42 - the logic of moving to a node gathering
00:44 - resources and moving back to storage
00:45 - then we're going to take our code and a
00:48 - persistent resource tracking so when the
00:50 - character drops going into the storage
00:52 - the amount won't be tracked the game
00:54 - resources class will be very simple and
00:56 - clean with easy ways to add and remove
00:58 - any gold amount after now we're going to
01:01 - create a resource node class to hang our
01:03 - objects instead of having our code based
01:05 - on transforms this again will be a very
01:07 - simple class that keeps track of the
01:08 - resources in each node and provides a
01:11 - way to the cap on our logic from the
01:12 - visual implementation the node won't
01:14 - change its visual if its internal
01:16 - resource amount is depleted then we're
01:19 - going to add player control to be able
01:21 - to command our Agana
01:22 - we're going to add the ability to
01:24 - capture clicks on the gold notes and
01:25 - tell together to mind that particular
01:27 - node using the player control for a
01:30 - single gatherer we're going to apply it
01:32 - to multiple gatherers we're going to
01:34 - make it so we click on together to
01:35 - select them which one visually show that
01:37 - he's the one selected then we're going
01:39 - to click on node and the selected
01:40 - gatherer will head and mind that node
01:43 - after that we're going to add multiple
01:45 - resource types so in addition to a god
01:48 - node that can be mined for gold we're
01:50 - going to add a tree that can be cut down
01:51 - for wood DM resources and resource node
01:54 - classes won't be set up in such a way
01:56 - that they can support any number of
01:58 - different resource types then we're
02:00 - going to set up resource regeneration
02:02 - instead of the node being depleted
02:04 - forever we're going to set up two
02:06 - different regeneration methods the node
02:08 - will regenerate a single amount after
02:10 - some time or fully regenerate after
02:12 - being completely depleted and finally
02:15 - when all that is done we're going to put
02:17 - it all together into a nice complete
02:18 - ecosystem
02:19 - we're going to set up tower construction
02:22 - which takes some time to construct in
02:23 - order to start construction we first
02:25 - need to gather a certain amount of
02:27 - golden wood then the tower is
02:29 - constructed and when it's completed it
02:31 - will spawn a brand-new gatherer that we
02:33 - can control like any other we won't give
02:35 - that new gather the order to gather more
02:37 - resources use those resources to
02:39 - construct another tower which was
02:40 - spawned all together and so on so that's
02:43 - a plan for the gather a iSeries it
02:45 - features some interesting logic and some
02:47 - nice clean code it won't start off
02:49 - pretty simple and ramped up in
02:51 - complexity until we have a nice complete
02:53 - minigame so go watch the playlist and
02:55 - begin learning as always you can
02:57 - download the project files in utilities
02:59 - for each video in the series from EMT
03:01 - code monkey comm if you have any
03:03 - questions post them in the comments and
03:04 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
