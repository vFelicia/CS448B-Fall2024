00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - the assur is full of awesome tools and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for May
00:09 - 24th in this first video I'll be
00:10 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:12 - ones I'll be covering paid asset and
00:13 - tools let me know in the comments if you
00:15 - pick up any of these and what you intend
00:16 - to do with them also if you need some
00:18 - mes the cint sell is having a sale right
00:20 - now pretty much all of their packs are
00:21 - at 50% off you can build an infinite
00:23 - amount of games with all these and right
00:25 - now the Sci-Fi worlds is 70% off this is
00:27 - the one that I use quite a lot in my
00:29 - dinky Guardians game or if you want a
00:30 - bundle then there's a great one on the
00:32 - asset at 97% off you can get 30 assets
00:35 - for just 30 bucks so there's a bunch of
00:37 - environments a bunch of materials you've
00:38 - got some effects some tools some systems
00:40 - and so on there's tons of stuff with a
00:42 - super deep discount so definitely check
00:43 - out this page to see if anything is
00:44 - interesting all right so on to the top
00:46 - 10 list starting with a nice onscreen
00:48 - pointer that can point to anywhere this
00:50 - is a 3D element so it can point to
00:52 - wherever you want and show it correctly
00:53 - on the UI you can set up the offscreen
00:55 - arrow and also the target indicator when
00:57 - it is on screen so it's a very nice very
00:59 - simple tool and you can also read the
01:01 - code on GitHub next for some fun UI
01:03 - icons here is an animation pack using
01:05 - animated icons can be an easy way to add
01:08 - an extra bit of Polish to your games you
01:09 - could make them for example static by
01:11 - default and then animate them on Mouse
01:14 - over these have various shapes so it's
01:16 - really up to you to decide what exactly
01:17 - do they mean if you like this pack of
01:19 - animated icons if so then then this dev
01:21 - has a paid pack with a ton more then
01:23 - here's a simple question do you need
01:25 - some bread if so then here is some
01:26 - stylized bread you've got 17 prefabs I
01:29 - would think that this is really just a
01:30 - demo of an En larger pack but no not
01:32 - really this is really just a pack it
01:34 - really is an asset pack with 17 pieces
01:36 - of bread definitely very odd but if
01:37 - you'd like to make a game kind of like a
01:39 - bread shop Tycoon if so then this would
01:41 - be great or perhaps if you need some AOE
01:44 - effects here's a nice free pack it
01:46 - features eight effects with shad graphs
01:48 - you've got some lightning there's some
01:49 - geysers some heel and some meteor
01:52 - effects these could be really great if
01:53 - you're making some kind of diablon like
01:55 - action RPG game something to down with
01:57 - tons of effects tons of skills or
01:59 - perhaps a fantasy RTS game with lots of
02:01 - abilities next for an interesting system
02:03 - here is an interaction system it
02:05 - features item pickup it has an inventory
02:08 - there's atom inspection it also has the
02:09 - ability to interact with objects like
02:11 - opening some doors you can either do
02:13 - that automatically or on button input so
02:15 - quite a handful of interactions within
02:17 - this asset this can be a super simple
02:19 - and very quick way to add some
02:20 - interactions to your protypes then if
02:22 - you want to break some stuff if so here
02:24 - are breakable jars vases and pots by
02:26 - breakable it means how you have a normal
02:28 - game object with the object perfectly
02:30 - built and then you have another one
02:32 - where it's broken into pieces now this
02:33 - is really great it's the simplest way to
02:35 - make some simple destruction it's when I
02:37 - covered in my destruction tutorial video
02:39 - If you have a game kind of like Zelda
02:41 - you can just listen to when the player
02:42 - attacks objects like this and then you
02:44 - just instantly spawn the prefab with
02:46 - some pieces spawn them maybe add some
02:48 - explosion with collisions and rigid
02:49 - bodies and just with that everything
02:50 - will fall apart into pieces in a very
02:52 - satisfying manner next for another nice
02:54 - tool here we have a minimalist notepad
02:56 - this is exactly what it sounds like it's
02:58 - a simple notepad like window directly
03:00 - inside of Unity by being a Unity window
03:02 - it means you can dock it anywhere inside
03:04 - your project so you could have for
03:05 - example a notepad right under the
03:07 - inspector this is pretty simple and can
03:09 - be potentially quite useful you can
03:11 - write notes for whatever you want this
03:13 - one is a free version and there's also a
03:15 - paid version if you want to handle
03:16 - multiple notes or perhaps if you need a
03:18 - pixelated character if so look at this
03:20 - one it's a nice soldier with an axe and
03:22 - a shield it features some interesting
03:24 - running jumping climbing animations so
03:26 - in total there's over 30 animations this
03:28 - could be a really great starting point
03:29 - for learning how to animate pixelated
03:31 - characters you can use this pack in
03:33 - order to learn how to figure out how to
03:34 - make the animator work and in the future
03:36 - you can replace it with your own custom
03:37 - pixel characters or perhaps pick up
03:39 - another character from this same
03:40 - developer next if you're making a racing
03:42 - game here is a nice free car model very
03:44 - simple it is literally exactly what you
03:46 - expect it's a nice low poly sports car
03:48 - so really perfect if you want to make a
03:50 - quick prototype of some kind of racing
03:52 - game and if you like this style and you
03:53 - want tons more cars just like this if so
03:56 - this St has tons more or maybe you're
03:57 - making a giant open world game if so and
04:00 - you need some stamps look at these
04:01 - height Maps I believe these can work
04:03 - with pretty much any kind of terrain
04:04 - system so I assume it works with unities
04:06 - built-in system or even Gaia these are
04:08 - stamp so it's really height maps you can
04:10 - just click in order to place all these
04:12 - interesting mountains directly inside
04:13 - your world so you can use these to add
04:15 - some really nice variety directly onto
04:17 - your terrains all right so those are my
04:19 - top 10 free new assets on the UN assur
04:21 - for May 24 there's a link to in the
04:22 - description and also check out my own
04:24 - fre p on store all right hope that's
04:26 - useful check out these videos to learn
04:28 - some more thanks to these awesome
04:29 - awesome patreon supporters for making
04:31 - these videos possible thank you for
04:33 - watching and I'll see you next time
