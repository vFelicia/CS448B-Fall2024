00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to cover
00:03 - the setup for you to DC let's get sir
00:08 - all right so let's start this from
00:10 - scratch this is the unity 20 18 new
00:13 - project window I'm going to name this
00:15 - project my new game and I'm going to use
00:18 - the 2d template everything else is fine
00:21 - so let's click create project ok so the
00:25 - project has been created then here's my
00:27 - empty scene this is our hierarchy and
00:30 - this is our project folder it starts off
00:32 - with a scenes folder and the sample
00:33 - scene inside it on our sample scene we
00:36 - have a main camera displaying a simple
00:38 - solid color as you can see the
00:40 - projection is set to orthographic which
00:42 - means it's rendering in 2d it has an
00:45 - orthographic size of 5 units this size
00:48 - represents the units that are visible
00:50 - vertically so let's create a empty game
00:53 - object just a scene so here on this
00:55 - object Y you can see that the camera is
00:58 - displaying vertically from minus 5 to
01:00 - plus five for the horizontal size it's
01:03 - going to depend on your resolution
01:05 - currently I'm using 16 by 9 but if you
01:07 - change this you can see the camera view
01:09 - change accordingly alright so that's the
01:11 - basic setup for the camera let's test
01:13 - just to make sure that everything is
01:15 - working so yep there you go the cameras
01:17 - is playing a simple solid color now
01:19 - let's set it up for our 2d game first
01:22 - let's rename the scene to give it a more
01:24 - appropriate name so let's name it a game
01:26 - scene this is a scene where most of the
01:28 - game runs you would have a different
01:30 - scene for the main menu maybe another
01:32 - for the level select and so on let's
01:34 - grab our empty game object place it on 0
01:37 - 0 and rename it to game tenly this will
01:41 - be the main container for all of our
01:43 - preset scene objects the better you keep
01:45 - your objects organized easier it is to
01:47 - find what you're looking for
01:48 - let's reg our camera into our game
01:50 - handler and just for testing let's make
01:53 - a background so new game object name it
01:55 - background let's add a component of type
01:59 - sprite renderer which is the primary
02:01 - component for displaying sprites in a 2d
02:04 - game now we need a sprite to render so
02:06 - let's create a new folder and we're
02:09 - going to name it textures inside I'm
02:12 - going to place an image which is just a
02:13 - white pixel it's a 1 by 1 PNG it's very
02:17 - useful to have a simple white pixel
02:18 - texture for when you want to display a
02:20 - solid color in a sprite renderer
02:22 - since as you can see if you don't assign
02:23 - a sprite you can't really see anything
02:25 - on the import options everything is
02:28 - mostly the defaults except for the
02:29 - pixels per unit which we're going to set
02:31 - to 1 since the texture is one by one
02:34 - when we use this as a sprite runner to
02:36 - occupy one unit so let's drag our sprite
02:39 - into our background as you can see a
02:41 - square of one by one and in the sprite
02:44 - renderer we have a corner parameter it
02:46 - acts as a multiply so since our sprite
02:49 - is white
02:49 - we can easily tint it let's tint it
02:52 - green to simulate some sort of grass
02:53 - texture and increase the size used to
02:56 - occupy our camera so as you can see the
02:58 - camera is correctly displaying our 2d
03:00 - background sprite so another thing that
03:02 - is useful in pre-standard is to have
03:03 - sorting layers on the sprite render you
03:06 - can see the sorting layer in here and we
03:08 - can add a new sorting layer right now we
03:11 - only have the default so let's add
03:13 - another one and name it background and
03:15 - let's another one and name it game
03:17 - objects the render order in here goes
03:20 - from top to bottom so let's drag the
03:22 - background on top being on the top of
03:24 - this array sanshi only means the
03:26 - background gets rendered first then the
03:27 - default gets rendered on top of the
03:29 - background then the game objects on top
03:31 - of the default so in our background
03:33 - let's put it on the background sorting
03:35 - layer and let's duplicate it name it
03:39 - something like player give it a
03:41 - different color and let's place it on
03:44 - the game objects so as you can see
03:46 - regardless of what we set on the order
03:48 - in layer the player will always be on
03:50 - top of the background since it is on a
03:52 - sorting layer above the background all
03:54 - right now normally in my scenes I have a
03:57 - helper pointer object just to help me
03:58 - identify positions in the game make a
04:01 - new game object and let's name it
04:03 - pointer and if we go up here we can give
04:06 - our pointer an icon which will make it
04:08 - very visible in the scene view and in
04:10 - the game view if you're showing gizmos
04:12 - so let's click it and as you can see it
04:15 - shows up in there and you can move it
04:17 - around to easily read that this position
04:18 - is on 4.4 and 2.6 and if you go into the
04:22 - game scene and enable gizmos you can
04:24 - also see it on the game it's running so
04:26 - anytime you want to locate a position on
04:27 - screen just grab this object and move it
04:29 - around and it's quite helpful especially
04:31 - when you use it while the game is paused
04:33 - okay now let's make our game
04:35 - script this will be the main script in
04:37 - our game make a new folder and let's
04:40 - call it scripts inside let's make a
04:44 - create c-sharp script and name it game
04:47 - handler
04:48 - so in son let's make a private droid
04:50 - start and a private oi update on our
04:55 - start let's simply do a debug game
04:58 - Handler dot start just to make sure that
05:01 - our script is running so let's go into
05:03 - our scene and we're going to drag that
05:05 - script into our game handler object so
05:08 - let's run the scene and we should see
05:10 - the script running in our console in
05:12 - here yep there you go the game is
05:14 - running and you can see game how long
05:15 - about start alright so now to make
05:17 - things much easier we're going to add
05:19 - the code monkey utilities which you can
05:21 - grab for free from unity code monkey
05:22 - calm these utilities contain any bunch
05:25 - of helper functions and classes that I
05:27 - have written over the years and help
05:28 - immensely when making a game and testing
05:30 - new mechanics the utilities contain
05:32 - plenty of comments so feel free to go
05:34 - through all the classes and view on the
05:36 - functionality all right so the utilities
05:38 - come as a unity package - I just
05:40 - double-click that file and it will open
05:42 - this window in unity in here you can
05:44 - view the list of files that will be
05:45 - added to our project
05:46 - let's click import and the files won't
05:49 - be added so as you can see a new folder
05:51 - appeared in here and inside are all the
05:53 - files for all of our utilities so now we
05:55 - can go back into our game Handler and in
05:57 - here let's test to make sure the
05:59 - utilities were correctly installed the
06:01 - utilities contain several namespaces so
06:04 - first we need to go up here and write
06:07 - using code monkey and also using code
06:11 - monkey itself so on starting here let's
06:15 - create a function periodic which
06:17 - triggers an action every certain amount
06:19 - of time so a function periodic we're
06:22 - going to create and here it takes an
06:25 - action and a timer so for the action
06:30 - let's go into the CM debug class and
06:32 - spawn a text object on the mods position
06:35 - so use the text pop-up mouse which is a
06:39 - helper function that spawns a text
06:41 - object on the mouse position in here
06:43 - let's just write something
06:47 - and in here you have the time so
06:51 - essentially every half a second
06:52 - this action will execute this action
06:55 - won't spawn a pop up on the mouse
06:57 - position you won't say ding and then a
07:00 - number which won't increase every time
07:02 - this action is called all right so let's
07:04 - test and we should see the message pop
07:06 - up on the mouse position okay yep there
07:09 - you go you can see the tacks pop up on
07:11 - the mouse position every half a second
07:13 - so that means the utilities are
07:15 - correctly installed this won't be very
07:16 - useful while making our game personally
07:18 - I use the e-textbook pop up all the time
07:20 - when I want to visualize an event while
07:22 - the game is running feel free to check
07:24 - out the code for the utilities and see
07:25 - all the various helper functions and how
07:27 - they can help you get your game up and
07:29 - running faster so there you have it we
07:31 - start with an empty scene and set it up
07:33 - to build a 2-d game we also install the
07:35 - code monkey utilities which won't help
07:37 - us in developing and debugging our game
07:39 - if you have any questions post them in
07:41 - the comments and I'll do my best answer
07:42 - now subscribe for more videos and I'll
07:44 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to cover the setup for you to DC let's get sir all right so let's start this from scratch this is the unity 20 18 new project window I'm going to name this project my new game and I'm going to use the 2d template everything else is fine so let's click create project ok so the project has been created then here's my empty scene this is our hierarchy and this is our project folder it starts off with a scenes folder and the sample scene inside it on our sample scene we have a main camera displaying a simple solid color as you can see the projection is set to orthographic which means it's rendering in 2d it has an orthographic size of 5 units this size represents the units that are visible vertically so let's create a empty game object just a scene so here on this object Y you can see that the camera is displaying vertically from minus 5 to plus five for the horizontal size it's going to depend on your resolution currently I'm using 16 by 9 but if you change this you can see the camera view change accordingly alright so that's the basic setup for the camera let's test just to make sure that everything is working so yep there you go the cameras is playing a simple solid color now let's set it up for our 2d game first let's rename the scene to give it a more appropriate name so let's name it a game scene this is a scene where most of the game runs you would have a different scene for the main menu maybe another for the level select and so on let's grab our empty game object place it on 0 0 and rename it to game tenly this will be the main container for all of our preset scene objects the better you keep your objects organized easier it is to find what you're looking for let's reg our camera
