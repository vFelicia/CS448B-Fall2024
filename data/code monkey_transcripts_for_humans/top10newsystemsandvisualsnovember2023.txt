00:38 - questions and do my best to help some
00:40 - examples from last month Gabrielle asked
00:42 - how did I get this much knowledge then
00:45 - Dan asked if I have done anything on
00:46 - late joining multiplayer games k America
00:49 - asked about how to make a border system
00:51 - like in Forex Space Games iron class VR
00:53 - asked about events saving and loading
00:55 - and also if I would make YouTube shorts
00:57 - talking about these Q&A questions so
00:59 - check it out the link in the description
01:00 - I'll try my best to answer your
01:01 - questions my question of the system is
01:03 - also going well the only last question
01:05 - is an interesting one about save data
01:07 - and how to convert between strings
01:09 - numbers and so on you can check it out
01:10 - on the website main page or check your
01:12 - emails if you signed up for them and
01:14 - finally the Black Friday sales are about
01:16 - to end so if there's something you need
01:17 - definitely get it quickly the one on the
01:19 - asset sore as the Cyber week live right

01:23 - the best assets if you like the low sale
01:25 - then the cyy store also has a s Monday
01:27 - sale also ending in about one day The
01:30 - Flash deal is on the shops back this one
01:31 - is really awesome if you want to make
01:33 - some kind of M tycoon game there are
01:34 - also two great humble bundles there's
01:37 - one with tons of Blended courses and
01:38 - materials I followed this one myself
01:41 - quite a while ago and I really enjoyed
01:42 - it I really learned a lot and there's
01:44 - also a bundle with a massive amount of
01:45 - Tod Sprites lots of characters cars
01:48 - environments space pack UI pack and tons
01:50 - more those are all Linked In the
01:51 - description which is usual those are all
01:53 - affiliate links so if you buy anything
01:54 - through those links it's the same price
01:56 - to you and I get a nice commission all
01:57 - right so starting off with a system that
01:59 - does EX only what it says it's a parkour
02:01 - and climbing system if you've been
02:03 - playing the recent Assassin's Creed and
02:05 - you'd like to build something like that
02:06 - then this could be a great starting
02:07 - point the animations are a little bit
02:09 - stted but it works exactly as you expect
02:11 - it features some regular box climbing
02:13 - you can jump on some edges you can swing
02:15 - from bars jump from edge to edge you can
02:17 - Vault balance and tons more to create a
02:20 - climb point you just select an object in
02:21 - the level and use the included tool to
02:23 - mark it as climbable swingable mountable
02:25 - and so on then the character is smart
02:27 - enough to identify the nearby climb
02:28 - point and select the an a mission now I
02:30 - must say this is one system that I've
02:32 - always wanted to research for myself
02:33 - when I played the recent Assassin's
02:35 - Creed it made me want to research that
02:36 - even more so hopefully in the future
02:38 - I'll have some more time to research
02:39 - this topic but if you just want a tool
02:41 - that just works then check this one out
02:43 - next is something that a lot of games
02:44 - have like for example Assassin's Creed
02:46 - which is a navigation system this one is
02:48 - actually not just one element but rather
02:51 - a ton of tracking and navigation
02:52 - elements all in one single pack you've
02:54 - got a radar kind of like a minimap then
02:56 - you've got a flat Compass like in
02:58 - something like Skyrim you've got some
02:59 - onscreen indicators some Edge arrows and
03:01 - tons more it's made by Infinity PVR so
03:04 - all the scripts are really very nicely
03:06 - detailed and very well put together and
03:08 - it also comes with some video tutorials
03:09 - to help you get started so if you need
03:11 - to guide your players in some way then a
03:12 - tool like this one can save you a ton of
03:14 - time then here's one that I hope doesn't
03:16 - get this video demonetized it's called
03:17 - Gore simulator like name implies it lets
03:19 - you create different body parts of a
03:21 - mesh and then slice them during gameplay
03:23 - it doesn't have to be horror game Gore
03:25 - doesn't have to be something super
03:26 - intense it can just be something like
03:28 - Doom where you have enemies and you just
03:30 - want them to blow up into various pieces
03:32 - or simply maybe some skeletons kind of
03:34 - like Skyrim where you really just want
03:36 - them to break into bones it includes a
03:38 - custom Editor to make it super easy to
03:40 - use you just assign a skin mesh render
03:42 - pick a button and it automatically
03:43 - creates all the colliders and all the
03:45 - various separated body parts if you have
03:47 - some kind of action game then this is
03:49 - one of those things that can easily be
03:50 - added with a tone like this one and it
03:52 - can really help take your game to the
03:53 - next level next here's a super simple
03:55 - one emojis for textmesh pro this one
03:58 - adds actual emojis to text smh Pro so
04:00 - this is not just a Sprite pack with this
04:02 - you can copy paste actual emojis like
04:04 - text emojis you can copy paste them into
04:06 - regular text objects and they won't be
04:08 - rendered perfectly it comes with a
04:09 - pre-built Sprite asset with the most
04:11 - popular emojis but also allows you to
04:13 - create custom Sprite asset if you want
04:14 - to use some different icons basically
04:16 - it's a simple tool that does exactly
04:17 - what it says if you have some kind of
04:19 - chat system in your game then this could
04:20 - be a nice way to make it a little bit
04:22 - more special then here we have one to
04:24 - help you polish up your world it's some
04:25 - Cloud Shadows this lets you create
04:27 - clouds of various shapes and then you
04:29 - can watch your shadows that those clouds
04:31 - cast directly on the floor this is one
04:33 - of those really subtle things that you
04:34 - never really notice but as soon as you
04:36 - add it you do see a massive difference
04:38 - you can modify a ton of properties on
04:39 - the clouds you can make them thicker or
04:41 - thinner move fast or slow you can change
04:43 - the color the randomness the animation
04:45 - and tons of more parameters really this
04:46 - is a great way to make your world feel
04:48 - much more alive up next here's a great
04:50 - one for helping you keep track of your
04:51 - time now for me a long time ago I did
04:53 - use to track my time I had a program
04:55 - that would track every single second
04:57 - although nowadays since I'm pretty much
04:58 - working all the time I don't really use
05:00 - it anymore but a tool like this one can
05:01 - be quite useful especially if you're
05:03 - making games on the side and you really
05:04 - want to keep track of how much time it
05:06 - takes you to build something this one is
05:07 - a simple tool that tracks time both
05:09 - active and idle it tracks the start and
05:11 - end times and then shows it all in some
05:13 - nice graphs and pie charts then for
05:15 - another relatively simple one here is a
05:17 - Color Picker UI it does exactly what you
05:19 - want lets you pick some colors it
05:20 - includes a bunch of templates so you can
05:22 - pick the one that you want this one is a
05:24 - great tool to include alongside some
05:26 - kind of modding tools in your game you
05:28 - can use it to let the player custom
05:29 - their player character player color logo
05:31 - color or really anything then here's a
05:33 - tool designed to help solve something
05:35 - that every game has to deal with which
05:37 - is bootstrapping just with a few clicks
05:39 - you can define a bootstrap scene and
05:41 - execute essential code before starting
05:43 - the regular gameplay so things like for
05:45 - example a sound manager or a music
05:46 - manager object or maybe in multiplayer
05:48 - game something like a network manager
05:49 - you really need those objects to be
05:51 - initialized before going into regular
05:52 - gameplay with tool like this one you can
05:54 - easily automate that process by simply
05:56 - implementing an interface and then it
05:58 - will automatically make sure those
05:59 - objects are initialized before the game
06:00 - play so this looks like a nice and
06:02 - simple tool to solve a really common
06:04 - problem next every game has tutorials
06:06 - which you need to build in some way so
06:07 - here's a tool to help that you define
06:09 - each tutorial stage you run some custom
06:11 - code on stage start or end then Define
06:13 - all the conditions to complete that
06:15 - stage you can easily make it based on
06:17 - some distance between two objects make
06:19 - it based on time clicks or really
06:20 - trigger it manually with the events for
06:22 - the stage start and end you can easily
06:24 - set up some visuals to guide the player
06:25 - throughout the tutorial there's a bunch
06:27 - of tools like this one and this one
06:28 - seems to be one of the better with a
06:29 - really nice watch then if you normally
06:31 - work on multiple objects this tool
06:33 - sounds really great it helps you link
06:35 - multiple projects together and then you
06:36 - can share assets between them so
06:38 - basically you share a folder and in that
06:39 - folder you place whatever assets you
06:41 - want and all the projects that are
06:42 - linking to that folder all of them can
06:44 - use the same assets this can be super
06:46 - useful to save space if you use the same
06:48 - assets all over the place in several
06:49 - projects so this one looks like a pretty
06:51 - simple to use but also very capable all
06:53 - right so that's the top 10 new systems
06:55 - and tools now on to the top 20 new
06:57 - visuals list all right so so starting
06:59 - off with a really nice looking pack for
07:01 - making an RTS or a tower defense game
07:03 - every time I see one of these packs it
07:05 - makes me want to make an RTS but then I
07:07 - remember that genre takes a massive
07:09 - amount of work and I'm already so busy
07:10 - so I can't really do it but if you do
07:12 - have the time and you want to make an
07:13 - RTS then a pack like this is perfect
07:15 - you've got tons of units all with some
07:17 - really nice animations there's eight
07:19 - Towers each with three levels of
07:20 - upgrades there's various buildings
07:22 - vehicles and planes all with some really
07:23 - nice colors which you can obviously
07:25 - recolor for multiple players or maybe
07:27 - you need a really high quality really
07:29 - unique Mech T-Rex look at this one I
07:31 - love the model it's an excellent look
07:33 - excellent style and it also comes with
07:34 - some great looking animations this dev
07:37 - has tons more mechanical dinosaurs so
07:39 - with a bunch of these maybe you can
07:40 - build something like Horizon zero Dawn
07:43 - then if you have some voxon prototype
07:45 - that you'd like to build check out this
07:46 - one it features a ton of cube like
07:48 - objects that you can use to build entire
07:50 - worlds you could either use this to make
07:52 - some pre-made Maps or you can give them
07:54 - to the player alongside some kind of
07:56 - building system to build something like
07:57 - Minecraft features a little bit of of
07:59 - everything with some very unique biomes
08:01 - next if you need a great modern UI pack
08:03 - check out this one all of it is very
08:04 - modern very clean very slick you've got
08:07 - lots of bars and Frames you've got
08:09 - various buttons toggles and Sliders it
08:11 - also includes some editor scripts so you
08:12 - can really modify everything to your
08:14 - heart content or if that's too modern
08:16 - and you want something a bit more
08:17 - medieval check out this one it's a
08:19 - modular Town pack you've got tons of
08:21 - objects over 300 meshes some VFX and
08:23 - decals all in a really good looking
08:26 - realistic style the demo scene includes
08:28 - an entire town with enem objects and
08:30 - fully interal buildings so this is one
08:32 - of those packs where if you just enjoy
08:33 - building things and you can just have
08:35 - fun with this pack without even having
08:36 - to make an entire game next if you need
08:38 - some VFX look at this one you've got
08:40 - over 200 effects there's lots of fire
08:43 - lots of smoke then also some really nice
08:45 - beams some explosions and all kinds of
08:47 - RS adding some great VFX is a super easy
08:49 - way to polish your games so definitely
08:51 - pick up a large pack like this one to
08:52 - really make your game stand out then if
08:54 - you're making a game in Japan check out
08:56 - this one personally I've never been to
08:58 - Japan I'd love to go someday but based
09:00 - on all the anime that I've seen this
09:01 - perfectly matches exactly what I imagine
09:03 - it features a ton of objects of all
09:05 - types everything you need to make an

09:09 - lots of Apartments houses and shops

09:25 - people buy these packs to make all kinds
09:26 - of medical apps with unity this is all
09:28 - super realistic and I assume it's all
09:30 - medically accurate at least based on
09:32 - what I know from working out all the
09:33 - muscles seem to be correct it's
09:35 - interesting how the fat distribution for
09:36 - the model seems to have something like
09:38 - 8% body fat in the ABS but then 15% legs
09:41 - so pretty much just like a fitness
09:42 - influencer you've got more shapes to
09:44 - modify the size for all kinds of organs
09:46 - view all the details about the muscle

the description which is usual those are all affiliate links so if you buy anything through those links it's the same price to you and I get a nice commission all right so starting off with a system that does EX only what it says it's a parkour and climbing system if you've been playing the recent Assassin's Creed and you'd like to build something like that then this could be a great starting point the animations are a little bit stted but it works exactly as you expect it features some regular box climbing you can jump on some edges you can swing from bars jump from edge to edge you can Vault balance and tons more to create a climb point you just select an object in the level and use the included tool to mark it as climbable swingable mountable and so on then the character is smart enough to identify the nearby climb point and select the an a mission now I must say this is one system that I've always wanted to research for myself when I played the recent Assassin's Creed it made me want to research that even more so hopefully in the future I'll have some more time to research this topic but if you just want a tool that just works then check this one out next is something that a lot of games have like for example Assassin's Creed which is a navigation system this one is actually not just one element but rather a ton of tracking and navigation elements all in one single pack you've got a radar kind of like a minimap then you've got a flat Compass like in something like Skyrim you've got some onscreen indicators some Edge arrows and tons more it's made by Infinity PVR so all the scripts are really very nicely detailed and very well put together and it also comes with some video tutorials to help you get started so if you need to guide your players in some way then a tool like this one can save you a ton of time then here's one that I hope doesn't get this video demonetized it's called Gore simulator like name implies it lets you create different body parts of a mesh and then slice them during gameplay it doesn't have to be horror game Gore doesn't have to be something super intense it can just be something like Doom where you have enemies and you just want them to blow up into various pieces or simply maybe some skeletons kind of like Skyrim where you really just want them to break into bones it includes a custom Editor to make it super easy to use you just assign a skin mesh render pick a button and it automatically creates all the colliders and all the various separated body parts if you have some kind of action game then this is one of those things that can easily be added with a tone like this one and it can really help take your game to the next level next here's a super simple one emojis for textmesh pro this one adds actual emojis to text smh Pro so this is not just a Sprite pack with this you can copy paste actual emojis like text emojis you can copy paste them into regular text objects and they won't be rendered perfectly it comes with a prebuilt Sprite asset with the most popular emojis but also allows you to create custom Sprite asset if you want to use some different icons basically it's a simple tool that does exactly what it says if you have some kind of chat system in your game then this could be a nice way to make it a little bit more special then here we have one to help you polish up your world it's some Cloud Shadows this lets you create clouds of various shapes and then you can watch your shadows that those clouds cast directly on the floor this is one of those really subtle things that you never really notice but as soon as you add it you do see a massive difference you can modify a ton of properties on the clouds you can make them thicker or thinner move fast or slow you can change the color the randomness the animation and tons of more parameters really this is a great way to make your world feel much more alive up next here's a great one for helping you keep track of your time now for me a long time ago I did use to track my time I had a program that would track every single second although nowadays since I'm pretty much working all the time I don't really use it anymore but a tool like this one can be quite useful especially if you're making games on the side and you really want to keep track of how much time it takes you to build something this one is a simple tool that tracks time both active and idle it tracks the start and end times and then shows it all in some nice graphs and pie charts then for another relatively simple one here is a Color Picker UI it does exactly what you want lets you pick some colors it includes a bunch of templates so you can pick the one that you want this one is a great tool to include alongside some kind of modding tools in your game you can use it to let the player custom their player character player color logo color or really anything then here's a tool designed to help solve something that every game has to deal with which is bootstrapping just with a few clicks you can define a bootstrap scene and execute essential code before starting the regular gameplay so things like for example a sound manager or a music manager object or maybe in multiplayer game something like a network manager you really need those objects to be initialized before going into regular gameplay with tool like this one you can easily automate that process by simply implementing an interface and then it will automatically make sure those objects are initialized before the game play so this looks like a nice and simple tool to solve a really common problem next every game has tutorials which you need to build in some way so here's a tool to help that you define each tutorial stage you run some custom code on stage start or end then Define all the conditions to complete that stage you can easily make it based on some distance between two objects make it based on time clicks or really trigger it manually with the events for the stage start and end you can easily set up some visuals to guide the player throughout the tutorial there's a bunch of tools like this one and this one seems to be one of the better with a really nice watch then if you normally work on multiple objects this tool sounds really great it helps you link multiple projects together and then you can share assets between them so basically you share a folder and in that folder you place whatever assets you want and all the projects that are linking to that folder all of them can use the same assets this can be super useful to save space if you use the same assets all over the place in several projects so this one looks like a pretty simple to use but also very capable all right so that's the top 10 new systems and tools now on to the top 20 new visuals list all right so so starting off with a really nice looking pack for making an RTS or a tower defense game every time I see one of these packs it makes me want to make an RTS but then I remember that genre takes a massive amount of work and I'm already so busy so I can't really do it but if you do have the time and you want to make an RTS then a pack like this is perfect you've got tons of units all with some really nice animations there's eight Towers each with three levels of upgrades there's various buildings vehicles and planes all with some really nice colors which you can obviously recolor for multiple players or maybe you need a really high quality really unique Mech TRex look at this one I love the model it's an excellent look excellent style and it also comes with some great looking animations this dev has tons more mechanical dinosaurs so with a bunch of these maybe you can build something like Horizon zero Dawn then if you have some voxon prototype that you'd like to build check out this one it features a ton of cube like objects that you can use to build entire worlds you could either use this to make some premade Maps or you can give them to the player alongside some kind of building system to build something like Minecraft features a little bit of of everything with some very unique biomes next if you need a great modern UI pack check out this one all of it is very modern very clean very slick you've got lots of bars and Frames you've got various buttons toggles and Sliders it also includes some editor scripts so you can really modify everything to your

really nice beams some explosions and all kinds of RS adding some great VFX is a super easy way to polish your games so definitely pick up a large pack like this one to really make your game stand out then if you're making a game in Japan check out this one personally I've never been to Japan I'd love to go someday but based on all the anime that I've seen this perfectly matches exactly what I imagine it features a ton of objects of all types everything you need to make an entire town or an entire city you've got lots of Apartments houses and shops you've got plenty of signs flowers cars and trains also you can build a really nice world and then just play around then here's a very expensive but a really great one it's a highly realistic Anatomy pack I've seen a bunch of these packs and I'm always fascinated I guess people buy these packs to make all kinds of medical apps with unity this is all super realistic and I assume it's all medically accurate at least based on what I know from working out all the muscles seem to be correct it's interesting how the fat distribution for the model seems to have something like 8% body fat in the ABS but then 15% legs so pretty much just like a fitness influencer you've got more shapes to modify the size for all kinds of organs view all the details about the muscle fat heart blood circulation and really anything certainly a very unique thing all with super high quality 8K textures then if there's a bike game you'd like to make check out this one it features a bunch of super bikes they all look seriously awesome I know nothing about bikes all I know is that these look really cool the pack is set on low poly but the models are actually quite detailed it features five Super bikes all with separated parts for easy animation

scenarios you've got lots of quick Jabs some huge punches you've got some serious knockdowns some Get Up animations some dodges and really powerful finishers it also includes some nice win Victory or defeat animations so this would be perfect for a boxing game or really just some kind of beat him up next here we have the latest cyti pack this one came out in late October right on Halloween and it very much fits that theme it starts off nice and normal during the daytime and then at night it turns into a very spooky horror Carnival right away this reminds me of playing Left for Dead that mission on that Carnival with the gnome really fun times this pack is in their signature gorgeous low poly style it features tons of objects bu buildings characters props and even a working feris wheel and Mero round then if you need some explosions check out this one all are really high quality very realistic with some 3D Volume there's some nice fire and then some satisfying smoke this was all created using fluid simulation so it's all very accurate if you just need one high quality unique character then check out this one it's a modern Samurai it's a really nice high quality model and it's all fully rigged so it works with any animations you can add some cloth physics for the trench coat or just grab that really gorgeous nice sword then for another spooky thing here is an apocalyptic Hospital definitely very spooky abandoned hospitals are always very creepy you could just use this demo scene directly if you need some kind of nice new level for your game whether it be

want to make your own Skull and Bones before Ubisoft does it then check this one out then here's a very fun one a really fancy golden rabbit definitely very strange very unique model these kinds of
