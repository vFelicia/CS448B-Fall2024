00:00 - here's the tip for debugging when you
00:01 - have multiple objects of the same type
00:03 - now usually you write a simple debug.log
00:05 - to see what is going on inside of script
00:07 - but if you have multiple objects of the
00:08 - same type it can be really hard to see
00:10 - what object is firing which message for
00:12 - example here in my game I want to
00:13 - inspect just this one Dy right now the
00:15 - console is showing messages for every
00:16 - single dinky so here's the tip add a
00:18 - string field and expose it in the editor
00:20 - you can add a text area to make it easy
00:22 - to read now instead of doing a debug.
00:24 - log I just set the debug string field on
00:25 - that dinky now with the game playing I
00:27 - can inspect that individual dinky and
00:29 - see debug.log for that one diing this is
00:31 - super useful for debugging individual
00:33 - objects when you've got a ton of them
