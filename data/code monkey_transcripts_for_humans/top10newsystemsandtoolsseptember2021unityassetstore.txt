00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset store is full of awesome tools
00:04 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some of the
00:10 - highlights that were released in august
00:11 - 2021
00:12 - this one is the list of paid systems and
00:14 - tools in the last video i already
00:16 - covered the best three new assets so go
00:18 - watch that if you haven't seen it and in
00:20 - the next video i will be covering the
00:22 - top assets and effects
00:24 - let me know which one of these you're
00:25 - most interested in and i might do a
00:26 - detailed review on it as always there's
00:29 - links to the ads in the description and
00:30 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
00:32 - monkey10 to get 10 off your order and by
00:34 - the way check out my own assets on the
00:36 - store so far i've made the free key door
00:37 - system which is a super simple way to
00:39 - add keys and doors to your game
00:41 - and the mouse cursor system pro which is
00:43 - a very easy to use tool to help you
00:45 - create some custom animated cursors to
00:47 - really make your game stand out
00:49 - alright so starting off with a really
00:51 - awesome explosion asset called easy mesh
00:53 - explosion
00:54 - it takes your mesh any mesh and slices
00:56 - it into tons of pieces with physics
00:59 - the effect looks really very satisfying
01:01 - you can play around with all kinds of
01:03 - parameters make it explode with a ton of
01:05 - force in one direction or just break it
01:07 - and let it fall down it's pretty cheap
01:09 - so this would be an easy way to add some
01:11 - extra polish to your game then if you're
01:13 - a fan of factory games and you like to
01:15 - build your own check out this complete
01:17 - template
01:18 - place down some machines place down the
01:20 - belts and select the recipe it includes
01:22 - a bunch of machines tons of items and
01:24 - various crafting recipes also has a safe
01:27 - load system it uses unity events and an
01:29 - abstract framework to make it really
01:31 - easy to expand upon and this one is
01:33 - mainly a code template so it works with
01:35 - any render pipeline i made a factory
01:37 - game quite a while ago and you can check
01:38 - the project files for that one but if
01:40 - you're looking for a more complete
01:41 - template then maybe check this one out
01:44 - next up if you need some water
01:45 - simulation check out flow it lets you
01:47 - add large-scale interactive fluids to
01:49 - your scene all highly optimized using
01:52 - gpu acceleration
01:53 - and you can also easily adjust the
01:55 - simulation resolution so this works on
01:57 - pcs consoles and also mobile the result
02:00 - in the video looks really good and it
02:01 - works on a massive map
02:03 - it has underwater rendering as well so
02:06 - you can dive under the water and the
02:07 - transition is seamless you can create
02:09 - whatever fluid types you want make some
02:11 - water mud oil and so on you can play
02:14 - around with all the parameters and
02:15 - change the color viscosity and opacity
02:18 - it also includes a buoyancy simulation
02:21 - so you can place down boats on the water
02:22 - and watch as they move up and down along
02:24 - with the waves this is definitely one
02:26 - i'd love to play around with and i might
02:27 - do a detailed review in the future
02:29 - another one that also looks really
02:31 - awesome is the town world creator
02:33 - if you're a fan of this style then this
02:35 - one is an excellent tool you define your
02:37 - tiles either in 2d using quads or phone
02:40 - 3d then you really just paint on a basic
02:42 - grid you can easily save and load your
02:44 - maps
02:45 - or you can also just generate them at
02:47 - will so it gives you infinite
02:48 - possibilities very importantly it also
02:51 - supports multiple layers so you're not
02:53 - limited to just a single plot point
02:55 - and it includes nine ton presets to
02:58 - start with all of them look pretty nice
03:00 - this one is actually the third version
03:01 - of this tool so it has been in
03:03 - development for a very long time and you
03:05 - can definitely trust this ability
03:06 - depending on how you set up your camera
03:08 - you can use this to build first person
03:10 - games or maybe some top down action or
03:12 - maybe some management games really
03:14 - interesting tool
03:15 - for something a bit simpler and possibly
03:17 - very useful here is an in-game text
03:19 - editor it's a fully fledged editor you
03:21 - can use directly inside your game so it
03:24 - works exactly like you would expect it
03:26 - features ctrl z undo support copy paste
03:29 - selection highlighting line numbers tone
03:31 - tips and tons more
03:33 - some of the screenshots show it being
03:34 - used as an in-game code editor there was
03:36 - a tool that i picked up quite a while
03:38 - ago that lets you compile c-sharp in
03:40 - runtime
03:41 - so if you combine that with this one
03:43 - then you can give your players a fully
03:45 - fledged code editor to be able to mod
03:47 - just about anything in your game
03:49 - that's a really interesting concept so
03:51 - i'd love to try out doing that exact
03:52 - same scenario sometime in the future if
03:54 - you want to easily play around with your
03:56 - meshes check out sculpting pro
03:58 - looks super useful for having some star
04:00 - assets and then easily creating tons and
04:02 - tons of variations to make your world
04:04 - feel much more unique it works both in
04:06 - the editor as well as runtime so this
04:08 - would also be an excellent tool to
04:10 - enable your players to easily customize
04:12 - some parts of your games includes a very
04:14 - detailed documentation so you can
04:16 - quickly learn how the tool works and
04:18 - they even show a vr demo which looks
04:20 - very interesting you are literally
04:22 - scoping meshes with your own hands and
04:24 - next up if you want a tool to help you
04:26 - manage state machines check out this
04:28 - state tree it's a node-based tool so you
04:31 - define your states define what they do
04:33 - and connect the dots it works by
04:35 - extending a base class and overriding a
04:36 - bunch of functions so it seems very easy
04:38 - to set up for something related to audio
04:41 - here is a dynamic music system i must
04:43 - say that audio is not my main area of
04:45 - expertise so i don't know just how
04:47 - useful this is but the result shown in
04:49 - the trailer does sound pretty good it
04:51 - reads metadata on your audio files which
04:54 - you can then import into unity and using
04:56 - that you can layer various sounds on top
04:58 - of one another
04:59 - so it seems like it's useful so you have
05:01 - fewer files like just one big audio
05:03 - files with tons of tags instead of tons
05:05 - of cutoff files you can go from section
05:08 - to section mix and fade between tracks
05:10 - and try it all out without having to hit
05:12 - play if you want something to help you
05:14 - organize your project here is project
05:16 - view enhanced
05:17 - it lets you color some folders give them
05:19 - different icons and even a different
05:21 - style
05:22 - easily edit the style sheet asset create
05:24 - your own presets and easily use them
05:26 - with a simple drag and drop it includes
05:28 - 150 custom icons for you to use
05:31 - it lets you sort assets by their name or
05:33 - their type you can add extra columns for
05:36 - things like font size modify date and so
05:38 - on and even adds row shading to make it
05:40 - easier to read some big lists pretty
05:43 - nice useful asset next up a code utility
05:46 - tool it lets you easily expose private
05:48 - fields so you can read their variables
05:50 - in the inspector and then those values
05:53 - with that attribute can also be used to
05:55 - update ui elements so this could help
05:57 - simplify your ui code as you're building
05:59 - your game or simply let you easily build
06:01 - some debugging tools to see the state of
06:03 - your variables while playing the game
06:05 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
06:07 - and systems on the unity asset store for
06:10 - august 2021 there's links to on the
06:12 - description and as a bonus you can use
06:14 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off
06:16 - your order
06:17 - check out the phone playlist to see more
06:19 - lists with free unpaid assets and let me
06:21 - know if you pick up any of these and
06:22 - what you intend to do with them also
06:24 - check out my own free unpaid assets on
06:26 - the store alright hope that's useful
06:28 - check out these videos to learn some
06:29 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
06:31 - supporters for making these videos
06:33 - possible thank you for watching and i'll
06:35 - see you next time
