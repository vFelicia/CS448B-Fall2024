00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - current state of unity dots and ECS and
00:03 - what is changed in these past few months
00:05 - there's been lots of great improvements
00:07 - that makes it much easier to use and
00:09 - sell has epic performance as usual let's
00:11 - begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:19 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:24 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:26 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:28 - video how fun consider subscribing so
00:30 - back in May I first got into unity dots
00:32 - and ECS and spent a long time learning
00:34 - and playing around with it in total I
00:36 - made 12 videos on a whole bunch of
00:38 - topics related to dots and ECS which you
00:40 - can find in the playlist in the
00:41 - description and now while dots and ECS
00:44 - has improved significantly since then
00:46 - I'm happy to say there haven't been many
00:47 - breaking changes so if you're completely
00:49 - new to unity dots you can go through all
00:52 - those videos in the playlist and pretty
00:54 - much all of it is still accurate the
00:56 - improvements have been more related to
00:57 - quality of life making it easier to
00:59 - write superfast dots code as well as
01:01 - making it work with game objects and
01:03 - automatically converting them into
01:04 - entities so here I won't go over some of
01:07 - the enlarged changes since that time if
01:09 - you want to learn more about dots and
01:11 - ECS then go check out that playlist and
01:13 - then come back here to see what changed
01:14 - for example I served one of the biggest
01:16 - changes this is announced back in the
01:19 - United Kingdom polenta teas for each
01:22 - inside a job component system so if you
01:24 - go through those videos you'll see that
01:26 - to make a job for security job struct
01:28 - then create the job instance set the
01:30 - data and schedule it now all that still
01:33 - works but using entities for each you
01:35 - can really cut down on the amount of
01:36 - code needed another awesome thing is
01:38 - automatically generating a monobehaviour
01:40 - component to be used in the editor I'm
01:43 - going to go over all of these changes
01:44 - and we'll test them out as we go on so
01:47 - for here I have my project setup with
01:49 - dots as you can see I'm using entities
01:51 - version 0.4 I also have bursts along
01:54 - with jobs and the hybrid render package
01:56 - okay so first of all back then I was
01:59 - under the impression that as that's went
02:00 - along it would eventually come with a
02:02 - dots editor so you wouldn't use game
02:04 - objects at all however in reality rather
02:07 - than selling everything from scratch
02:08 - over the past few months the focus has
02:10 - been to improve the conversion workflow
02:12 - that way you can still use the editor
02:14 - like you've always done and everything
02:16 - gets automatically converted into
02:17 - entities as soon as you run your game so
02:20 - here for example let's make a simple
02:21 - object like always so we make an empty
02:24 - game object let's call this our player
02:26 - and inside we add a mesh filter and for
02:30 - a mesh let's select a simple
02:31 - then let's add a mesh renderer and for
02:35 - the vision let's drag this material with
02:37 - a sprite and yep just like this here we
02:40 - have a very simple sprite as we've
02:41 - always done now in order to convert this
02:43 - from a game object into an entity all we
02:46 - need to add is the component convert to
02:48 - entity just by adding this component as
02:50 - soon as M runs this game object will be
02:53 - converted into an entity representation
02:55 - and then don't be destroyed if you're
02:57 - using custom components and naturally
02:59 - you need to handle the conversion
03:00 - yourself but for all normal human T
03:02 - components like the mesh filter mesh
03:04 - render and so on it's on automatic so if
03:06 - I run the game right now and if there
03:09 - you go the sprite is still there just as
03:10 - normal however if we pause and look at
03:12 - the hierarchy yep there you go our game
03:14 - object is now gone and now we can go
03:16 - into window analysis check the entity
03:19 - debugger and there you go over here we
03:21 - can see our player entity so they
03:23 - convert 20d script automatically
03:25 - construct this entity based on the
03:27 - components we have in our game object so
03:30 - in those videos I made pretty much all
03:31 - of it straight through code which again
03:33 - still works in this valid approach but
03:35 - right now thanks to the conversion
03:37 - entity workflow you can do what you've
03:39 - always done in the editor using game
03:41 - objects and simply add the convert to
03:43 - entity script another very important and
03:45 - very useful change is automatically
03:47 - making authoring components for example
03:49 - let's try making a simple component so
03:52 - in here we just make a new c-sharp
03:54 - script let's call this the move
03:56 - direction and now inside let's get rid
03:58 - of monobehaviour and all this and
04:01 - instead let's make a simple component so
04:03 - first we add using unity dot entities
04:05 - and then we had a public struct let's
04:09 - call this our move direction and we
04:11 - implement by component data then inside
04:14 - of our component let's add just a simple
04:16 - field so a public float called Val okay
04:19 - so here we have a very basic component
04:21 - with a single value however just like
04:23 - this if I go back into the editor
04:24 - here's my script here's my player and if
04:27 - I try to drag it if there you go we have
04:29 - an error we cannot add components if
04:32 - they do not derive from on a behavior
04:33 - however I can go back into the code and
04:36 - now we can add the new attribute called
04:39 - generate authoring component this will
04:43 - automatically generate a mono behavior
04:45 - see for this component so now I can go
04:47 - back and now I can select my player and
04:50 - drag the script and yep there you go it
04:52 - is example like that our move Direction
04:53 - authoring component now I can modify the
04:56 - value to put whatever I want so all I
04:58 - need is this simple attribute and you
05:00 - can play around with the components as
05:02 - if they were normal monobehaviour
05:03 - scripts so again this goes back to
05:06 - making a conversion workflow very easy
05:07 - to use now that we have our component
05:10 - and our player automatically converted
05:11 - into an entity let's look at the
05:13 - entities for each so for that let's make
05:15 - our system so we make a new script call
05:18 - this our player movement system now here
05:22 - we have our script and again this is not
05:24 - a mono behavior instead this is a job
05:27 - component system which again is inside
05:32 - unity entities so here we have our job
05:40 - component system with our on update and
05:43 - now previously back when I made those
05:44 - videos we had to make a job stroke to
05:47 - them of our job logic so we have to make
05:49 - something like a struct my job and
05:52 - implement I job I job for each or
05:54 - anything like that so essentially we had
05:56 - to build a struct and then initialize
05:58 - the struct inside of our job update so
06:00 - that still works however right now it's
06:02 - much similar to make a simple job here
06:05 - in the update we can use entities dot
06:07 - for each so here we take in a lambda
06:13 - function and if you've worked in normal
06:16 - component systems then you already know
06:17 - how this for each is so simple
06:19 - previously I would normally do a single
06:22 - threaded component system first to get
06:23 - on the logic working then I will convert
06:25 - it into a job now we can just straight
06:27 - do all that here on the job so here
06:29 - inside of our lambda let's do a for each
06:32 - and cycle through all the entities with
06:33 - a translation and move the Russian
06:35 - components okay so we sound through all
06:40 - the translation and move direction and
06:42 - now here we can also define which
06:44 - components are read and which are
06:45 - read/write so if you wanted to be read
06:47 - only like four is only move direction
06:49 - then we add the in keyword and if you
06:52 - wanted to read and write then we add the
06:54 - ref keyword so in this case we want to
06:57 - read and write on to the trend
06:58 - question but only really move direction
07:00 - so now inside of our four inch let's
07:02 - simply move the translation based on the
07:04 - move direction so we're going to move
07:06 - the translation dot value X and increase
07:09 - it by the move direction dot valid in
07:11 - order to make it frame rate independent
07:13 - let's also multiply it by adult time so
07:16 - we need to grab that time outside of the
07:18 - job so outside of the job for each so in
07:22 - here we make a float for our double time
07:25 - and inside we can use it alright so here
07:33 - we have our very simple job moving the
07:35 - translation based on the move direction
07:37 - now just like this we are setting up the
07:39 - job then we need to actually schedule it
07:41 - so after doing our for each week all
07:44 - scheduled and we pass our input
07:47 - dependencies and after scheduling this
07:50 - returns our job handle so we simply
07:52 - store our job handle and we can return
07:57 - our job handle so let's test any of
08:01 - there you go there's our sprite
08:02 - constantly moving to the right and in
08:04 - the entity debugger we can see our
08:06 - player movement system working on the
08:08 - player so again here's our job component
08:10 - system working with the simplified for
08:12 - each syntax if you compare it to the
08:14 - older videos you'll see that this helps
08:15 - in cutting down the amount of code
08:17 - needed by quite a massive amount now in
08:19 - here you can schedule it which won't be
08:20 - run by the job system however you can
08:23 - also make it run on just a single thread
08:24 - so instead of schedule we just call run
08:27 - and if we run this is now return a job
08:30 - handle so instead in here we can return
08:32 - just default and then up here we can add
08:35 - the attribute always synchronized system
08:38 - this forces all dependencies to run and
08:41 - synchronize before running this one so
08:43 - if we run this and if there you go
08:45 - there's our sprite constantly moving to
08:47 - right so everything still works now
08:52 - previously when you define a job struct
08:54 - you had to add the worst compiled
08:56 - attribute in order for it to use burst
08:57 - however now it's the opposite by default
09:00 - everything will use burst and if you
09:02 - need to do something that is not allowed
09:04 - with burst then over here on the
09:05 - entities you can add the filter without
09:07 - burst so by default your code
09:12 - run super fast with burst and if you
09:14 - find the inverse error in the console
09:15 - then you just need to add this filter
09:17 - next we have two things which have
09:19 - completely different names so if you run
09:21 - the code exactly as it is in those
09:23 - videos you need to change them in order
09:25 - to run so inside using unity dot
09:27 - collections you have the various dots
09:30 - collections for example you have a
09:32 - native cue and in order to write to it
09:38 - you would make a native cue concurrent
09:41 - in order to get it you would go into the
09:44 - native cue and you would call two
09:46 - concurrent now the behavior still works
09:51 - the same however now it has been renamed
09:53 - into the parallel writer and then as
09:56 - parallel writer so it works exactly the
09:58 - same just to name that change now
10:01 - another breaking change is regarding the
10:02 - active world so whenever you need to
10:04 - access the world to get something like
10:06 - the entity manager you would do world
10:09 - are active and find the entity manager
10:14 - however right now the correct way to do
10:17 - this is instead we use world dot default
10:20 - game object injection world so this is
10:22 - the world where all of your game objects
10:24 - that I have automatic conversion won't
10:26 - go into this was changed because that
10:28 - may or may not be the currently active
10:30 - world so in those videos when you see
10:32 - one that active you can replace it with
10:34 - world dot default game object injection
10:37 - world now one more thing that is not
10:39 - something that actually changed but
10:40 - rather is something I haven't covered
10:41 - yet and has been doing great progress
10:43 - and that starts physics again this is
10:46 - all being done so that the normal
10:47 - conversion workflow makes it super easy
10:49 - to use so here in my project I also
10:52 - installed the Unity physics package and
10:54 - in order to use it we just go into an
10:56 - add component and we have a regular
10:58 - normal rigidbody component and just like
11:01 - this if we now run the game and if there
11:03 - you go there's my sprite following along
11:05 - with gravity so as you can see the
11:07 - normal rigidbody component gets
11:08 - automatically converted into it dots
11:10 - physics rigidbody so I can also add a
11:13 - sphere Collider and then for example add
11:15 - this bouncy material and underneath put
11:18 - another object
11:26 - so here I have a nother object just a
11:29 - basic wall and again just by running it
11:31 - and there you go we have physics working
11:34 - and again these are using dots physics
11:36 - so we have nothing on our hierarchy so
11:38 - look forward to a video decade - that's
11:40 - physics coming very soon also one thing
11:42 - I want to point out if you're some very
11:44 - new to dots then one excellent learning
11:46 - tool you can use is visual scripting
11:48 - I've done a video on it and even if you
11:50 - have no interest in visual scripting
11:52 - itself it can so be very useful because
11:54 - it's all dots based and most importantly
11:56 - contains a code viewer so you can make a
11:59 - simple visual script get used to the
12:01 - logic between entities components and
12:02 - systems and then look at the code viewer
12:04 - to see how the underlying code works for
12:07 - example you'll be able to see the code
12:09 - viewer making queries and running
12:10 - entities for each so even if you have no
12:13 - interest in visual scripting you can
12:15 - still use it to learn how dots and ECS
12:17 - works all right so if you're completely
12:19 - new to unity dots and ECS then go check
12:20 - out that playlist other than these minor
12:23 - changes all of the code and structures
12:25 - shown in those videos is still valid now
12:27 - I plan to get back to making dots videos
12:29 - especially since it's meant to come out
12:31 - of preview in just a couple of months so
12:32 - the future looks very exciting let me
12:34 - know in the comments what type of dots
12:35 - content would you like to see maybe a
12:37 - complete simple game maybe a showcase
12:39 - like the Marines vs. zombies videos
12:41 - maybe some specific system let me know
12:43 - in the comments as always you can
12:45 - download the project found in a tony's
12:46 - from unity code muqaam subscribe to the
12:49 - channel for more EMT tutorials posting
12:51 - question have in the comments and I'll
12:52 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to look at the current state of unity dots and ECS and what is changed in these past few months there's been lots of great improvements that makes it much easier to use and sell has epic performance as usual let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video how fun consider subscribing so back in May I first got into unity dots and ECS and spent a long time learning and playing around with it in total I made 12 videos on a whole bunch of topics related to dots and ECS which you can find in the playlist in the description and now while dots and ECS has improved significantly since then I'm happy to say there haven't been many breaking changes so if you're completely new to unity dots you can go through all those videos in the playlist and pretty much all of it is still accurate the improvements have been more related to quality of life making it easier to write superfast dots code as well as making it work with game objects and automatically converting them into entities so here I won't go over some of the enlarged changes since that time if you want to learn more about dots and ECS then go check out that playlist and then come back here to see what changed for example I served one of the biggest changes this is announced back in the United Kingdom polenta teas for each inside a job component system so if you go through those videos you'll see that to make a job for security job struct then create the job instance set the data and schedule it now all that still works but using entities for each you can really cut down on the amount of code needed another awesome thing is automatically generating a monobehaviour component to be used in the editor I'm going to go over all of these changes and we'll test them out as we go on so for here I have my project setup with dots as you can see I'm using entities version 0.4 I also have bursts along with jobs and the hybrid render package okay so first of all back then I was under the impression that as that's went along it would eventually come with a dots editor so you wouldn't use game objects at all however in reality rather than selling everything from scratch over the past few months the focus has been to improve the conversion workflow that way you can still use the editor like you've always done and everything gets automatically converted into entities as soon as you run your game so here for example let's make a simple object like always so we make an empty game object let's call this our player and inside we add a mesh filter and for a mesh let's select a simple then let's add a mesh renderer and for the vision let's drag this material with a sprite and yep just like this here we have a very simple sprite as we've always done now in order to convert this from a game object into an entity all we need to add is the component convert to entity just by adding this component as soon as M runs this game object will be converted into an entity representation and then don't be destroyed if you're using custom components and naturally you need to handle the conversion yourself but for all normal human T components like the mesh filter mesh render and so on it's on automatic so if I run the game right now and if there you go the sprite is still there just as normal however if we pause and look at the hierarchy yep there you go our game object is now gone and now we can go into window analysis check the entity debugger and there you go over here we can see our player entity so they convert 20d script automatically construct this entity based on the components we have in our game object so in those videos I made pretty much all of it straight through code which again still works in this valid approach but right now thanks to the conversion entity workflow you can do what you've always done in the editor using game objects and simply add the convert to entity script another very important and very useful change is automatically making authoring components for example let's try making a simple component so in here we just make a new csharp script let's call this the move direction and now inside let's get rid of monobehaviour and all this and instead let's make a simple component so first we add using unity dot entities and then we had a public struct let's call this our move direction and we implement by component data then inside of our component let's add just a simple field so a public float called Val okay so here we have a very basic component with a single value however just like this if I go back into the editor here's my script here's my player and if I try to drag it if there you go we have an error we cannot add components if they do not derive from on a behavior however I can go back into the code and now we can add the new attribute called generate authoring component this will automatically generate a mono behavior see for this component so now I can go back and now I can select my player and drag the script and yep there you go it is example like that our move Direction authoring component now I can modify the value to put whatever I want so all I need is this simple attribute and you can play around with the components as if they were normal monobehaviour scripts so again this goes back to making a conversion workflow very easy to use now that we have our component and our player automatically converted into an entity let's look at the entities for each so for that let's make our system so we make a new script call this our player movement system now here we have our script and again this is not a mono behavior instead this is a job component system which again is inside unity entities so here we have our job component system with our on update and now previously back when I made those videos we had to make a job stroke to them of our job logic so we have to make something like a struct my job and implement I job I job for each or anything like that so essentially we had to build a struct and then

unity dot collections you have the various dots collections for example you have a native cue and in order to write to it you would make a native cue concurrent in order to get it you would go into the native cue and you would call two concurrent now the behavior still works the same however now it has been renamed into the parallel writer and then as parallel writer so it works exactly the same just to name that change now another breaking change is regarding the active world so whenever you need to access the world to get something like the entity manager you would do world are active and find the entity manager however right now the correct way to do this is instead we use world dot default game object injection world so this is the world where all of your game objects that I have automatic conversion won't go into this was changed because that may or may not be the currently active world so in those videos when you see one that active you can replace it with world dot default game object injection world now one more thing that is not something that actually changed but rather is something I haven't covered yet and has been doing great progress and that starts physics again this is all being done so that the normal conversion workflow makes it super easy to use so here in my project I also installed the Unity physics package and in order to use it we just go into an add component and we have a regular normal rigidbody component and just like this if we now run the game and if there you go there's my sprite following along with gravity so as you can see the normal rigidbody component gets automatically converted into it dots physics rigidbody so I can also add a sphere Collider and then for example add this bouncy material and underneath put another object so here I have a nother object just a basic wall and again just by running it and there you go we have physics working and again these are using dots physics so we have nothing on our hierarchy so look forward to a video decade that's physics coming very soon also one thing I want to point out if you're some very new to dots then one excellent learning tool you can use is visual scripting I've done a video on it and even if you have no interest in visual scripting itself it can so be very useful because it's all dots based and most importantly contains a code viewer so you can make a simple visual script get used to the logic between entities components and systems and then look at the code viewer to see how the underlying code works for example you'll be able to see the code viewer making queries and running entities for each so even if you have no interest in visual scripting you can still use it to learn how dots and ECS works all right so if you're completely new to unity dots and ECS then go check out that playlist other than these minor changes all of the code and structures shown in those videos is still valid now I plan to get back to making dots videos especially since it's meant to come out of preview in just a couple of months so the future looks very exciting let me know in the comments what type of dots content would you like to see maybe a complete simple game maybe a showcase like the Marines vs. zombies videos maybe some specific system let me know in the comments as always you can download the project found in a tony's from unity code muqaam subscribe to the channel for more EMT tutorials posting question have in the comments and I'll see you next time
