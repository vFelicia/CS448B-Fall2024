00:00 - here's a quick unity tip did you know
00:02 - that you can set the number of lines

00:12 - so you can go up here into these three
00:14 - dots and select how many lines you want
00:16 - to show
00:17 - if you want to see the constant for
00:18 - every message then you can choose a
00:20 - large amount
00:21 - or what i prefer is to just select one
00:23 - line and it only shows the message
00:24 - then if you want to go deeper you can
