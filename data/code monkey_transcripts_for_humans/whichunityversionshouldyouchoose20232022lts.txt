00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a quick video to help you
00:03 - choose the correct unity version for
00:05 - your project
00:06 - the way versions are set up is actually
00:08 - some quite simple logic but can also be
00:10 - a bit confusing for a beginner so let's
00:12 - see
00:12 - if you want the quick and easy answer
00:14 - just go with the latest lts version
00:16 - but for more detail keep watching the
00:18 - video one quick note here the important
00:20 - takeaway from this video
00:21 - are the categories and what they mean
00:23 - the specific versions that i'm going to
00:24 - mention
00:24 - are just examples but the categories in
00:26 - which they fit is the important part
00:28 - which should still be relevant even if
00:30 - you're watching this many months or
00:31 - years in the future
00:32 - so first let me cover the naming scheme
00:35 - the first part is the year when that
00:36 - version was first released
00:38 - the second part is the major version
00:40 - number then it's the minor version along
00:42 - with the state alpha beta or final
00:45 - at any given point in time there are
00:47 - usually three versions you can choose
00:49 - at the time of this recording you have
00:50 - 2019.4
00:52 - 2020.2 and 2021.2 those fall into three
00:56 - categories
00:56 - you have long term support tech and
00:59 - preview
00:59 - now you might think that the best
01:01 - version to choose is the very last one
01:03 - however that's not exactly right the
01:05 - very last version which as of right now
01:07 - is 2021.2
01:09 - is in the alpha or beta stage meaning
01:12 - that it's potentially unstable
01:13 - so it should only be used if you want to
01:15 - help unity with their beta testing
01:17 - program
01:17 - which by the way they also have some
01:19 - nice prices to give away if you do
01:20 - manage to find a bug
01:22 - so this version represents the future
01:24 - and since it's an alpha or beta
01:26 - version it is potentially unstable after
01:28 - that comes the tech release
01:30 - which as of the time of this recording
01:31 - is 20.2
01:33 - this one is more stable than the alpha
01:35 - or beta versions but still potentially
01:37 - unstable as it is constantly receiving
01:39 - new features and updates
01:41 - this one contains lots of preview
01:42 - packages so that people can test them
01:44 - although again that comes at the cost of
01:46 - potential instability
01:47 - and finally you have the lts version or
01:50 - long term support
01:51 - this is the most stable version possible
01:53 - this version has gone through rigorous
01:55 - extensive testing to ensure everything
01:57 - works perfectly and all of the validated
01:59 - packages work correctly without any
02:01 - issues
02:01 - the only updates this version gets are
02:03 - bug fixes it does not get any new
02:05 - features after it goes into lts
02:08 - unity keeps actively supporting their
02:09 - versions for 2 years after release
02:11 - so you won't find two separate lts
02:13 - versions right now you can use 2019.4
02:16 - lts or 2018.4 lts
02:18 - also one quick note regarding the lts
02:20 - major version number
02:22 - previously unity was making four major
02:24 - releases per year with the last one
02:25 - being the lts version
02:27 - so that is why you have 2018.4 in 2019.4
02:31 - those are the lts versions
02:32 - however last year they switched to only
02:34 - three major releases per year in order
02:36 - to make each release more stable
02:38 - so that means that in a few months when
02:40 - 2020 goes into lts it will be 2020.3 lts
02:44 - so putting all of this together how do
02:45 - you choose a unity version is very
02:47 - simple
02:47 - do you want to help unity with their
02:49 - beta testing program
02:50 - if so then choose the preview version
02:52 - otherwise ask yourself what does your
02:54 - project require
02:55 - does your project absolutely require
02:57 - features which are currently in preview
02:59 - and only available in the tech version
03:01 - so for example is your game dependent on
03:03 - something like unity dots
03:04 - if so then you do need to use the attack
03:06 - version but do ask yourself if you
03:09 - absolutely need those features
03:11 - in the vast majority of cases your game
03:13 - will not be pushing the limits of what
03:14 - is possible so you should be using the
03:16 - lts versions and if there are multiple
03:19 - lts versions available and you're just
03:20 - starting out then simply choose the
03:22 - latest lts version
03:23 - that is why even though we're already in
03:25 - the middle of 2021 i am still using
03:27 - 2019.4 on my projects
03:29 - that's because it's the most stable
03:30 - version and most of the things that i
03:32 - cover are normal things which do not
03:33 - require anything special
03:35 - however as an example i've also done
03:37 - some machine learning videos
03:38 - those are indeed on the bleeding edge so
03:41 - for those i did use 20 20 because that's
03:43 - what the package requires
03:44 - whenever 2020 enters lts then it'll
03:46 - switch into using that version
03:48 - also you can have multiple versions and
03:50 - so on here in the unity hub you can go
03:53 - into install and here you see all of the
03:54 - available versions that i just mentioned
03:57 - and here you can see that i have quite a
03:58 - lot of them installed at the same time
04:00 - and if you have more than one then when
04:02 - you go into create a new project you can
04:04 - click on the arrow icon
04:06 - and this lets you choose specifically
04:07 - which version you want to use to create
04:09 - the new project
04:10 - also somewhat related to the unity
04:11 - version are the package versions so let
04:13 - me quickly mention them as well
04:15 - on the packages you also have three
04:16 - states you have preview
04:18 - released and verified preview packages
04:20 - like the name implies are in active
04:22 - development and should only be used to
04:24 - preview what's coming in the future
04:26 - in order to even see the preview
04:27 - packages you need to go into the options
04:29 - to show the preview packages
04:31 - and if you install any of them you will
04:32 - also see a big button letting you know
04:34 - that you are using preview packages
04:36 - which might be unstable
04:37 - then you have release packages they have
04:39 - gone through preview and are considered
04:41 - stable
04:42 - and after that you have verified
04:44 - packages these are just like the lts
04:46 - versions
04:46 - they have gone through extensive
04:48 - rigorous testing with a specific unity
04:49 - version to ensure maximum stability
04:52 - so when it comes to packages ideally you
04:54 - should be using the verified packages
04:56 - combined with the unity version they
04:57 - were verified for
04:58 - but in my experience the funny release
05:00 - packages are also very stable so don't
05:02 - worry about using those
05:03 - and again the preview packages are only
05:05 - meant for testing and researching the
05:07 - feature of the engine
05:08 - so just to reiterate on how to choose a
05:10 - unity version
05:11 - the alpha or beta versions are meant
05:13 - only for testing
05:14 - if you want to be an active tester then
05:16 - use those but if you just want to make
05:18 - games then don't touch them
05:20 - then comes the tech version if you want
05:21 - to experiment with the bleeding edge of
05:23 - tech and see what the future won't feel
05:24 - like then do use those
05:26 - but again if you just want to make games
05:28 - then don't finally the
05:29 - lts version in 99 of cases this is what
05:33 - you should be using since it won't do
05:34 - everything you want to do and it will
05:36 - have the utmost stability
05:38 - alright hope that helped you understand
05:39 - how unity versions work
05:41 - thanks to these awesome patreon
05:43 - supporters for making these videos
05:44 - possible
05:45 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
05:46 - next time

05:55 - you

previously unity was making four major releases per year with the last one being the lts version so that is why you have 2018.4 in 2019.4 those are the lts versions however last year they switched to

choose a unity version is very simple do you want to help unity with their beta testing program if so then choose the preview version otherwise ask yourself what does your project require does your project absolutely require features which are currently in preview and only available in the tech version so for example is your game dependent on something like unity dots if so then you do need to
