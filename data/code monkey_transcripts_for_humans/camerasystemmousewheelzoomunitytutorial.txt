00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to use the
00:03 - camera system we created previously and
00:05 - add the functionality to zoom in and out
00:08 - using the mouse wheel lets get served
00:13 - so we previously created our camera
00:16 - system and made it very easy to move and
00:18 - zoom around a position now in here I
00:20 - have the scene from the previous video
00:22 - where we implemented Mouse edge scroll I
00:24 - can move the camera with the keyboard
00:27 - and I'm moving the mouse to the edges of
00:29 - the screen okay let's go into our code
00:33 - here and in here we set up our camera
00:36 - fall position and we set a fixed value
00:38 - for our zoom let's change that for a
00:41 - variable so go up here and make a
00:44 - private float zoom and that's what we're
00:48 - going to send to our camera phone system
00:50 - now let's first start off by cleaning up
00:53 - our code here and put the movement and
00:55 - edge scrolling to their own functions so
00:58 - copy all this and create something
01:00 - called handle manual movement go down
01:06 - here private boy handle manual movement
01:11 - and we're going to paste this code and
01:13 - Farley Lloyd handle page scrolling and
01:19 - we're going to copy this code
01:26 - okay our code is much more clean right
01:29 - now so let's set up a private void
01:32 - handle zoom and we're going to call this
01:37 - in here so let's start off by modifying
01:40 - our zoom with keyboard buttons so in
01:43 - here if input got get king of Kiko dot
01:47 - keypad was so in here we're going to
01:52 - reduce our zoom the zoom is our
01:55 - orthographic size so the lower the size
01:57 - the more you are zoom then the bigger
01:59 - the size the more you are zoomed out so
02:01 - in order to zoom in let's reduce it by a
02:04 - zoom change a long times time down the
02:08 - time and let's set our zoom change
02:12 - amount in here and we're going to set it
02:15 - to let's say eighty per second and
02:19 - copy/paste the same thing for the keypad
02:21 - - except we're going to increase okay
02:26 - let's see if we can now handle our zoom
02:28 - using the keyboard
02:29 - first of all let's set our default value
02:32 - so we don't immediately zoom in to zero
02:34 - so let's set the default to eighty and
02:37 - give it a shot
02:39 - okay so it is automatically going
02:41 - towards eighty and when I press to keep
02:43 - out pause it seems in keypad - and it
02:46 - zooms out okay great
02:49 - now in here and let's validate our zoom
02:52 - values so let's do zoom equals method
02:55 - clam and we're going to clamp our zoom
02:59 - between let's say 40 °f and 250 F so we
03:03 - don't zoom too much in or too much out
03:05 - okay let's see if we are with invalid
03:08 - values so I can zoom in and there you go
03:12 - that's my maximum zoom in I can zoom out
03:14 - and that's my maximum zoom out okay
03:18 - great everything is working right now
03:21 - let's apply this same logic to the mouse
03:23 - wheel in order to access the mouse wheel
03:25 - we're going to use input dot mouse
03:27 - scroll Delta so in here before we
03:29 - validate our values let's test if input
03:33 - dot mouse scroll
03:36 - which is actually a vector2 but our
03:38 - mouse wheel is only moving vertically so
03:40 - we're going to use the Y if the Y is
03:43 - bigger than zero then we are going to
03:47 - zoom in and if it is less than zero then
03:55 - we are going to zoom out and since this
03:58 - will execute less times than our gate
04:00 - key which is called every frame whereas
04:02 - this one is only called when we're
04:03 - actually moving our wheel let's make the
04:06 - zoom change amount a bit more intense so
04:08 - let's multiply it by ten and see how it
04:13 - is I can zoom in and zoom out all right
04:19 - there you have it very simple to add
04:20 - mouse wheel zoom as always you can
04:23 - download the project files in utilities
04:24 - for free from unity code monkey comm if
04:27 - you have any questions post them in the
04:29 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
04:30 - them ok see you next time
