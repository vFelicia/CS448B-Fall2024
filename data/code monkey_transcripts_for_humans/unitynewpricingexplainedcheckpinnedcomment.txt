00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so here's some Unity news there's a
00:04 - pricing change it's a bit complex so
00:06 - there's already a ton of confusion and
00:07 - unanswered questions I'm going to try my
00:10 - best to answer them based on how I
00:11 - understand things basically the tldr is
00:13 - if you are an indie Dev like me making
00:15 - PCR console games then probably nothing
00:17 - is really changing in Mobile the math
00:19 - might be different I'm not familiar with
00:21 - mobile world so I really cannot comment
00:23 - on how this change affects mobile but
00:25 - for PC and console devs it slightly
00:27 - means no difference so here's the full
00:29 - announcement blog post basically
00:30 - starting from next year Unity will
00:32 - introduce a new Unity runtime fee that
00:34 - is based on game installs here it
00:35 - mentions the unity runtime several times
00:37 - basically the UNT runtime is what
00:39 - actually runs you in the game so you
00:41 - have the empty editor that is where you
00:42 - actually make your game then you make a
00:44 - build when you run that build executable
00:46 - that is the unity runtime basically this
00:48 - new fee won't apply when above the
00:50 - thresholds for both revenue and installs
00:52 - now this end over here this one is very
00:54 - important this is one of the main points
00:56 - of confusion so if he only applies if
00:58 - above the revenue in the last 12 months
01:00 - and above the lifetime game installs now
01:03 - one good news from all this is that
01:04 - there is no longer a limit on revenue or
01:06 - funding for using the free version so
01:08 - Unity personal will now be available for
01:10 - anyone regardless of how much revenue
01:11 - they make this is a really good thing
01:13 - because it means that if your game makes
01:14 - for example a million bucks you can
01:16 - still now stay within the free version
01:17 - whereas previously you could only use
01:19 - the free version up to a revenue or
01:21 - funding of 100K if you made more than
01:23 - that then you would need to get the
01:24 - empty plus and if you made more than
01:26 - 200k you would need to get Pro so then
01:28 - down here is the chart for what the fee
01:29 - actually is and how it applies basically
01:31 - you have the three tiers so if you have
01:33 - the unity personals that's the free
01:34 - version Unity Pro and then Enterprise
01:36 - then you've got the revenue thresholds
01:38 - these are all based on the last 12
01:40 - months then if you have to install
01:41 - threshold so this is number of installs
01:43 - per lifetime then if the installs are
01:45 - above this amount and it's above this
01:47 - revenue on the last 12 months if so then
01:50 - this is the rate that is applied so for
01:52 - the free version when going above 200k
01:54 - installs after that it's 20 cents per
01:56 - install then UNT Pro you've got 15 cents
01:58 - and gets cheaper as you get more our
02:00 - installs and for emerging markets so
02:02 - countries like China India Brazil and so
02:04 - on for these you've got a lower end zone
02:06 - then there's also a fee reduction for
02:07 - using NT Services there's not much
02:09 - detail on this so I don't know how
02:11 - exactly the fee is reduced but
02:12 - apparently this fee goes down if you're
02:14 - using yinty gaming services or ENT level
02:16 - play so this is their ad mediation thing
02:18 - again I'm not very familiar with mobile
02:20 - and then the new services so just a
02:22 - bunch of tools just clarifying some
02:23 - things so all Unity plans won't get the
02:25 - empty centers this is their upcoming
02:27 - machine learning tool which allows you
02:29 - to run machine learning directly on the
02:30 - device this is related to the ml agents
02:33 - package that I covered quite a while ago
02:34 - then ENT personal will apparently get
02:36 - something called DNT asset manager I
02:38 - think this is pretty much just some
02:39 - cloud storage then you've got TNT devops
02:42 - this is related to Version Control and
02:44 - CI and CD and so on then build minutes
02:46 - for making builds in the cloud and so on
02:48 - and like it says here unity plus is
02:50 - being retired for new subscribers you
02:52 - can either drop down to the free version
02:53 - or somehow upgrade to Pro at the castle
02:55 - plus so basically all this this part is
02:57 - on pretty understandable the main
02:58 - confusion really comes over here from
03:00 - the VM chart now the reason as to why my
03:02 - analysis is that nothing is really
03:04 - changing for devs like me making PC and
03:06 - console games the reason for that is
03:07 - because these numbers are really made
03:08 - for mobile
03:09 - in Mobile getting 200k or a million
03:12 - installs that is really pretty standard
03:13 - whereas for a premium PCR console game
03:15 - selling 200 000 copies that is a
03:18 - Monumental Mega hit again keep in mind
03:20 - that I have no experience in Mobile so
03:22 - everything that I'm saying here is from
03:23 - the point of view of a PC on Console Dev
03:25 - I have no idea how reasonable this fee
03:27 - is in the mobile world but in the same
03:29 - world I think it helps to think of a
03:31 - concrete example so for example I talked
03:33 - a while ago about a game that was
03:35 - massively successful if you have a
03:36 - three-man team like the team that made
03:38 - battle pet remastered and you were to
03:40 - sell 3 million copies and make 35
03:41 - million dollars if so then under the
03:43 - current terms you really only have to
03:44 - pay Unity 6K per year that's the cost of
03:47 - three prone licenses whereas for example
03:49 - Unreal Engine has a five percent fee on
03:51 - gross revenue above 1 million so on that
03:53 - same example if battlebed had been
03:54 - created using in real they would have to
03:56 - pay 1.7 million dollars instead of just
03:57 - 6K and then under these new Unity terms
04:00 - add 3 million copies sold instead of
04:02 - paying Unity just 6K they would instead
04:04 - pay 80 grand so definitely a very big
04:06 - increase but still pretty much a running
04:08 - error compared to the 35 5 million
04:10 - dollars in Revenue but that's also an
04:12 - example of a monumentally successful
04:13 - game for most Indies both engines really
04:15 - have excellent pricing for most cities
04:17 - both engines are completely free and the
04:20 - simple reason is that for most Indies
04:21 - making Steam games this pricing change
04:23 - really means no change since most Indies
04:24 - won't be way under all of these numbers
04:26 - I believe the stats are that 90 of games
04:29 - on scene never make more than 5K so this
04:31 - fee will not apply to something like
04:33 - 99.9 of Steam games for example I'm
04:36 - working on my own upcoming steam game
04:37 - within Guardians I really hope that the
04:39 - game will find success but to me success
04:41 - means just selling a thousand copies
04:43 - even if in my wildest dreams the game
04:45 - would be a huge hit and sell 10 000
04:47 - copies that is still 190 000 under this
04:49 - current limit although in my case I
04:51 - actually have Unity Pro so in my case
04:52 - that would actually be 990 000 under the
04:55 - new limit so my general takeaway is if
04:57 - you are an indie Dev on the same scale
04:59 - as me then it's very unlikely you won't
05:00 - ever hit anywhere close to these
05:02 - thresholds again keep in mind I'm
05:04 - talking about in the context of Premium
05:05 - PC console games for mobile the math is
05:07 - very different now right away there's a
05:09 - ton of confusion on all this the fact
05:11 - that the fee is per install means there
05:13 - are a ton of possible and weird edge
05:15 - cases which are not really explained
05:17 - anywhere there's an official FAQ with a
05:19 - bunch of questions but there are
05:20 - certainly so many unanswered questions
05:22 - the official Forum thread already has
05:24 - hundreds of posts and lots of questions
05:25 - so here let me try to clarify some
05:27 - things although do keep in mind that I
05:29 - do not work for Unity I'm just a normal
05:31 - developer they use zinty just like you
05:33 - so what I'm going to say here is based
05:35 - on reading the blog post very carefully
05:37 - I do not have any extra secret knowledge
05:39 - now the main thing that people are
05:40 - confusing is the end it is actually
05:42 - highlighted up here in the text it says
05:45 - that only games that meet the following
05:46 - thresholds qualify for the fee so those
05:48 - that have above the revenue and above
05:51 - the lifetime in songs it is confusing
05:53 - because down here in the chart it is not
05:54 - clear that it is and on both of these
05:56 - conditions so some people think that
05:58 - this fee applies if you go above the
06:00 - revenue or above the install threshold
06:02 - that is not correct this one is an and
06:04 - meaning for example if you're using
06:06 - Unity personal then this fee will only
06:08 - apply if your game has two 200k in
06:10 - lifetime insults and over 200k in
06:13 - Revenue over the past 12 months a lot of
06:15 - the confusion in the forums is people
06:16 - asking what if I have an old game and
06:18 - someone in sales do I have to pay and
06:20 - the answer is you only have to pay if
06:22 - that old game has made over 200k in
06:24 - Revenue in the past 12 months if the
06:26 - game was super successful in the past
06:27 - but no longer in the present if the game
06:29 - goes under that Revenue threshold then
06:31 - you don't have to pay any fee regardless
06:32 - of how many insults another point of
06:34 - confusion is people asking if this
06:36 - applies to their entire studio and the
06:37 - answer to that is no this is on a per
06:39 - game basis everything on the blog post
06:41 - is referring to a game not a studio so
06:43 - for example if you have a huge hit and
06:45 - then the next game is a flop you don't
06:47 - have to pay any fee for that second game
06:49 - even if the huge hit is still bringing
06:50 - in over 200k per year then some people
06:52 - who are also confused thinking you would
06:54 - have to pay this fee per user per month
06:56 - meaning if the user plays your game for
06:58 - two months you would have to pay two
07:00 - fees and the answer is no the fee is per
07:02 - install again it looks confusing because
07:04 - the chapter over here mentions a
07:06 - standard monthly rate so it makes it
07:08 - seem like you have to pay 20 per
07:10 - instound per month that is not correct
07:12 - basically the monthly over here has to
07:14 - do with when you have to pay basically
07:16 - the invoice for the install cost is
07:18 - going to be invoiced on a monthly rate
07:19 - but this is not the monthly cost so
07:22 - every month it is going to check the
07:23 - revenue and in some count above the
07:25 - threshold meaning how many unique songs
07:27 - were added in the previous month and
07:29 - then use that to complete the invoice
07:30 - but again this amount per install is
07:32 - just once per user even if your user
07:34 - plays your game for next 10 years then
07:36 - some more confusion is related to the
07:37 - threshold some people were thinking that
07:39 - as soon as you hit the 200k install
07:41 - threshold then suddenly you have to pay
07:43 - 20 cents times 200k that is not correct
07:46 - if you are on the personal free license
07:47 - and your game generates above 200k in
07:50 - Revenue in the past 12 months and you
07:52 - sell 200 000 in one copy you pay just 20
07:55 - cents the fee is per install above the
07:58 - threshold it is not for all of it
08:00 - another very important question is what
08:01 - about free demos nowadays making a free
08:03 - demo and participating in a Sim Festival
08:05 - is really important to finding success
08:07 - so for demos the answer is technically
08:09 - yes 3 demos do count but again the fee
08:11 - only happens if above the download and
08:14 - above the revenue threshold so for a
08:16 - free demo even if you get 200k demo
08:18 - downloads since it's free you won't have
08:20 - zero Revenue so it does not trigger the
08:21 - fee related to that some people were
08:23 - saying that eventually a demo won't
08:24 - become a paid game and for that I
08:26 - believe the answer is you simply make a
08:28 - project on the NT dashboard for the demo
08:30 - and then a separate project for the
08:31 - final game that way the demo downloads
08:33 - do not count for the final game then
08:35 - there were also a bunch of questions for
08:37 - which there seems to be no clear answer
08:38 - for example how are installs tracked if
08:41 - your game uses any online service like
08:43 - for example analytics or Cloud
08:44 - Diagnostics then that's on rate Track by
08:46 - default but what if you're not using any
08:49 - online service how exactly does that
08:50 - work the answer that I get from UNT is
08:52 - it will attempt a simple connection to
08:54 - the ENT servers and importantly I was
08:56 - told that if that connection fails it
08:58 - does not break the game so this change
09:00 - does not force your game to be online
09:01 - all the time that was my first question
09:03 - when I first heard this and with regards
09:05 - to that simple connection someone asked
09:07 - does this break any privacy and loss now
09:09 - for that I believe the answer is no
09:10 - because as far as I know the player ID
09:12 - that is generated that does not have any
09:14 - personally identifiable data I believe
09:16 - that one is just a random hash so I
09:18 - don't think it has issues with privacy
09:20 - but I'm not a lawyer so I definitely
09:22 - could be wrong about that related to
09:24 - that question is what about reading
09:25 - songs say your player installs the game
09:27 - then uninstalls it and plays it a year
09:29 - later is that two separate in sounds or
09:31 - just one like I said I believe there are
09:33 - tracking installs through the player ID
09:34 - which is stored in the registry now I'm
09:36 - actually not sure if uninstalling a
09:38 - steam game wipes a registry if it does
09:40 - then I believe that would count as two
09:42 - installs and if it doesn't then I
09:43 - believe it would just count as one
09:45 - install another question with no clear
09:47 - answer is what about piracy so if
09:49 - someone Parts your game and plays it
09:50 - does that count I believe the answer is
09:52 - those and sounds do indeed count
09:54 - although supposedly Unity has some fraud
09:57 - prevention algorithm that they're
09:58 - already using in their ads and they
09:59 - won't be using the same algorithm here
10:01 - although of course I have no idea how
10:03 - well that works or how much of a problem
10:05 - this will be and related to that what
10:07 - about simply malicious actors so what is
10:09 - someone makes a script to uninstall and
10:11 - reinstall your game constantly in that
10:13 - case I believe the answer is yes that
10:15 - would count so technically if your game
10:17 - is above the revenue threshold then
10:18 - technically this could be a big problem
10:20 - basically you have to trust that their
10:22 - fraud prevention algorithm is very good
10:23 - at detecting that so as you can see in
10:25 - lots of questions lots of confusion I
10:27 - hope I helped clarify at least some of
10:29 - these and hopefully the rest will become
10:31 - clear in the very near future but in
10:33 - general my main takeaway is just like I
10:35 - said in the beginning if you're an
10:36 - in-depth like me especially a Sim or
10:38 - console Indie dev then there's really no
10:40 - change like I mentioned in my own
10:41 - example if by some miracle in my own
10:43 - game sells over a million copies I would
10:45 - gladly pay this new fee and if you want
10:47 - to help me make that Miracle a reality
10:49 - go ahead and add dinky Garden see your
10:51 - wishlist I'm hard at work to get the
10:52 - game ready for release early next month
10:54 - alright so I hope this quick news update
10:56 - was helpful thanks for watching and I'll
10:58 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so here's some Unity news there's a pricing change it's a bit complex so there's already a ton of confusion and unanswered questions I'm going to try my best to answer them based on how I understand things basically the tldr is if you are an indie Dev like me making PCR console games then probably nothing is really changing in Mobile the math might be different I'm not familiar with mobile world so I really cannot comment on how this change affects mobile but for PC and console devs it slightly means no difference so here's the full announcement blog post basically starting from next year Unity will introduce a new Unity runtime fee that is based on game installs here it mentions the unity runtime several times basically the UNT runtime is what actually runs you in the game so you have the empty editor that is where you actually make your game then you make a build when you run that build executable that is the unity runtime basically this new fee won't apply when above the thresholds for both revenue and installs now this end over here this one is very important this is one of the main points of confusion so if he only applies if above the revenue in the last 12 months and above the lifetime game installs now one good news from all this is that there is no longer a limit on revenue or funding for using the free version so Unity personal will now be available for anyone regardless of how much revenue they make this is a really good thing because it means that if your game makes for example a million bucks you can still now stay within the free version whereas previously you could only use the free version up to a revenue or funding of 100K if you made more than that then you would need to get the empty plus and if you made more than 200k you would need to get Pro so then down here is the chart for what the fee actually is and how it applies basically you have the three tiers so if you have the unity personals that's the free version Unity Pro and then Enterprise then you've got the revenue thresholds these are all based on the last 12 months then if you have to install threshold so this is number of installs per lifetime then if the installs are above this amount and it's above this revenue on the last 12 months if so then this is the rate that is applied so for the free version when going above 200k installs after that it's 20 cents per install then UNT Pro you've got 15 cents and gets cheaper as you get more our installs and for emerging markets so countries like China India Brazil and so on for these you've got a lower end zone then there's also a fee reduction for using NT Services there's not much detail on this so I don't know how exactly the fee is reduced but apparently this fee goes down if you're using yinty gaming services or ENT level play so this is their ad mediation thing again I'm not very familiar with mobile and then the new services so just a bunch of tools just clarifying some things so all Unity plans won't get the empty centers this is their upcoming machine learning tool which allows you to run machine learning directly on the device this is related to the ml agents package that I covered quite a while ago then ENT personal will apparently get something called DNT asset manager I think this is pretty much just some cloud storage then you've got TNT devops this is related to Version Control and CI and CD and so on then build minutes for making builds in the cloud and so on and like it says here unity plus is being retired for new subscribers you can either drop down to the free version or somehow upgrade to Pro at the castle plus so basically all this this part is on pretty understandable the main confusion really comes over here from the VM chart now the reason as to why my analysis is that nothing is really changing for devs like me making PC and console games the reason for that is because these numbers are really made for mobile in Mobile getting 200k or a million installs that is really pretty standard whereas for a premium PCR console game selling 200 000 copies that is a Monumental Mega hit again keep in mind that I have no experience in Mobile so everything that I'm saying here is from the point of view of a PC on Console Dev I have no idea how reasonable this fee is in the mobile world but in the same world I think it helps to think of a concrete example so for example I talked a while ago about a game that was massively successful if you have a threeman team like the team that made battle pet remastered and you were to sell 3 million copies and make 35 million dollars if so then under the current terms you really only have to pay Unity 6K per year that's the cost of three prone licenses whereas for example Unreal Engine has a five percent fee on gross revenue above 1 million so on that same example if battlebed had been created using in real they would have to pay 1.7 million dollars instead of just 6K and then under these new Unity terms add 3 million copies sold instead of paying Unity just 6K they would instead pay 80 grand so definitely a very big increase but still pretty much a running error compared to the 35 5 million dollars in Revenue but that's also an example of a monumentally successful game for most Indies both engines really have excellent pricing for most cities both engines are completely free and the simple reason is that for most Indies making Steam games this pricing change really means no change since most Indies won't be way under all of these numbers I believe the stats are that 90 of games on scene never make more than 5K so this fee will not apply to something like 99.9 of Steam games for example I'm working on my own upcoming steam game within Guardians I really hope that the game will find success but to me success means just selling a thousand copies even if in my wildest dreams the game would be a huge hit and sell 10 000 copies that is still 190 000 under this current limit although in my case I actually have Unity Pro so in my case that would actually be 990 000 under the new limit so my general takeaway is if you are an indie Dev on the same scale as me then it's very unlikely you won't ever hit anywhere close to these thresholds again keep in mind I'm talking about in the context of Premium PC console games for mobile the math is very different now right away there's a ton of confusion on all this the fact that the fee is per install means there are a ton of possible and weird edge cases which are not really explained anywhere

cents times 200k that is not correct if you are on the personal free license and your game generates above 200k in Revenue in the past 12 months and you sell 200 000 in one copy you pay just 20 cents the fee is per install above the threshold it is not for all of it another very important question is what about free demos nowadays making a free demo and participating in a Sim Festival is really important to finding success so for demos the answer is technically yes 3 demos do count but again the fee only happens if above the download and above the revenue threshold so for a free demo even if you get 200k demo downloads since it's free you won't have zero Revenue so it does not trigger the fee related to that some people were saying that eventually a demo won't become a paid game and for that I believe the answer is you simply make a project on the NT dashboard for the demo and then a separate project for the final game that way the demo downloads do not count for the final game then there were also a bunch of questions for which there seems to be no clear answer for example how are installs tracked if your game uses any online service like for example analytics or Cloud Diagnostics then that's on rate Track by default but what if you're not using any online service how exactly does that work the answer that I get from UNT is it will attempt a simple connection to the ENT servers and importantly I was told that if that connection fails it does not break the game so this change does not force your game to be online all the time that was my first question when I first heard this and with regards to that simple connection someone asked does this break any privacy and loss now for that I believe the answer is no because as far as I know the player ID that is generated that does not have any personally identifiable data I believe that one is just a random hash so I don't think it has issues with privacy but I'm not a lawyer so I definitely could be wrong about that related to that question is what about reading songs say your player installs the game then uninstalls it and plays it a year later is that two separate in sounds or just one like I said I believe there are tracking installs through the player ID which is stored in the registry now I'm actually not sure if uninstalling a steam game wipes a registry if it does then I believe that would count as two installs and if it doesn't then I believe it would just count as one install another question with no clear answer is what about piracy so if someone Parts your game and plays it does that count I believe the answer is those and sounds do indeed count although supposedly Unity has some fraud prevention algorithm that they're already using in their ads and they won't be using the same algorithm here although of course I have no idea how well that works or how much of a problem this will be and related to that what about simply malicious actors so what is someone makes a script to uninstall and reinstall your game constantly in that case I believe the answer is yes that would count so technically if your game is above the revenue threshold then technically this could be a big problem basically you have to trust that their fraud prevention algorithm is very good at detecting that so as you can see in lots of questions lots of confusion I hope I helped clarify at least some of these and hopefully the rest will become clear in the very near future but in general my main takeaway is just like I said in the beginning if you're an indepth like me especially a Sim or console Indie dev then there's really no change like I mentioned in my own example if by some miracle in my own game sells over a million copies I would gladly pay this new fee and if you want to help me make that Miracle a reality go ahead and add dinky Garden see your wishlist I'm hard at work to get the game ready for release early next month alright so I hope this quick news update was helpful thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
