02:02 - [Music]
03:10 - all right hey everyone how's it going
03:12 - hope you're having a great Tuesday today
03:14 - thank you all so much for being here
03:16 - nice already quite a lot of people
03:18 - that's fun all right
03:25 - [Music]
03:27 - uh post this and yep everything's good
03:31 - all right great so yep basically I'm
03:34 - still doing some research on my upcoming
03:37 - dots RTS game uh so yeah I've got a
03:40 - bunch of things that I want to
03:42 - research uh primarily doing animation
03:45 - and physics those are two things that
03:47 - I'm really trying to trying to get to
03:50 - work in this prototype so when will the
03:52 - course be done not sure it depends a lot
03:54 - it depends on how the how soon I can get
03:57 - this protyp finished so first I got to
03:59 - get this fully done and then I can start
04:02 - to plan out all the lectures the whole
04:04 - thing for the entire course so yeah I
04:06 - don't know I don't know exactly when
04:08 - Maybe by uh the middle of next month I
04:12 - should have a better ideas for now I'm
04:15 - still very much just doing a ton of
04:17 - research like for example for this for
04:19 - handling physics uh this is something
04:21 - that I haven't yet I mean I've been
04:22 - using physics which is actually uh
04:24 - pretty easy to do but I haven't yet
04:26 - looked into Collision events and Trigger
04:28 - events so this actually something
04:29 - something that I very much would like to
04:31 - research please research n code for
04:33 - enties yeah eventually afterwards I mean
04:37 - ideally I would like to make uh this
04:39 - course kind of what I did with kitchen
04:40 - chaos which is make it a single player
04:43 - thing and then a second one turning it
04:44 - into multiplayer I think that that would
04:46 - be fun but yeah definitely net Cod Ford
04:49 - is still going to take a little while
04:50 - until I until I actually uh have the
04:54 - time to research that because yeah uh
04:58 - okay so yeah so basally let me look into
05:00 - so basically doing some research live on
05:02 - stream because I haven't yet looked into
05:04 - how to handle Collision events I've
05:06 - looked at the documentation over here
05:08 - and it's actually it seems like it's
05:10 - somewhat simple to do so basically I can
05:12 - get the singl ton for the simulation and
05:15 - then grab some kind of trigger events
05:17 - and then iterate through them and
05:18 - apparently that will work so that is
05:22 - kind of what I'm going to uh try to see
05:25 - how it works so yeah let's try doing
05:27 - that so first I'm going to well actually
05:30 - first well actually first here is the
05:33 - the current uh project right now already
05:36 - got quite a lot of mechanics so I've got
05:37 - unit selection so I can select I can
05:39 - select a bunch of them tell them where
05:41 - to move there are different Unity types
05:43 - so this one is a unit kind of like this
05:46 - and that little small one that one moves
05:47 - quite a bit faster same thing for the
05:49 - enemies they got multiple enemies then
05:51 - the units they also find and attack all
05:53 - kinds of things and there there is a
05:55 - health system and the enemies are also
05:57 - patrolling around so they Patrol the B
05:59 - bullets go ahead they shoot the enemies
06:01 - also attack the player and then I can
06:03 - also easily spawn some enemies and I can
06:05 - spawn some barracks and from those
06:07 - Barracks I can spawn the building and
06:10 - start spawning some units so that is
06:12 - also done and I can start generating
06:14 - some resources so I can place down
06:16 - buildings to generate some supposedly
06:18 - gold or wood so already quite got quite
06:21 - a lot of things over here but there's
06:23 - still quite a bit more that I uh still
06:27 - have left to do so let's see
06:31 - you feel with all your experience you
06:32 - still often learn and have to look
06:34 - things up absolutely I mean especially
06:35 - when it's things that are new like for
06:37 - example this Dots Dots is very much new
06:39 - to me no matter how much experience I
06:41 - have so yeah I've definitely read a ton
06:43 - of the documentation over here on the
06:44 - physics package on the normal Unity on
06:47 - the uh entities package yeah definitely
06:49 - reading a ton of documentation doing a
06:51 - bunch of Googling and just a ton of
06:53 - trial and error write some code try to
06:55 - see if it works doesn't work try again
06:57 - so yep I'm definitely still looking
06:59 - things up up still learning uh so yeah
07:01 - that is one of those things that is very
07:02 - much a constant thing so yeah that is
07:05 - definitely person perfectly
07:06 - normal I have question on CCS so you do
07:10 - on update to find all the entities that
07:12 - contain something and so on and then
07:13 - execute code like follow the player yep
07:15 - but is there a way to get a reference to
07:17 - a bowling variable to check if the game
07:19 - is
07:20 - paused uh yes I mean first of all you
07:23 - can mix between uh dots and game objects
07:26 - so for example where's my unit mover
07:28 - system unit mover system and this is
07:31 - throwing out this warning which is very
07:32 - strange so yeah Bas L dots you've got an
07:34 - on update then you do a 4 each on that 4
07:36 - each you do some kind of system query
07:38 - and you grab all the components that you
07:40 - want so for example this is the unit
07:41 - mover system so this is the uh system
07:43 - that is actually moving all of the
07:44 - individual units so I do a query in
07:47 - order to find the local transform this
07:48 - one is basically basically the same as
07:50 - the transform component so has a
07:52 - position rotation and scale then I've
07:53 - got the target position I made this uh
07:55 - custom component myself just to have a
07:57 - movement speed and a Target position so
07:59 - that's the position where the unit
08:00 - should move to and then the physics
08:02 - velocity this one is part of the dots
08:04 - physics and using that I can basically
08:06 - set the velocity directly so basically I
08:07 - do a query to find all of those I grab
08:10 - uh all of those components and then
08:11 - using those over here calculate the move
08:13 - Direction so just some super simple
08:15 - basic movement code so just grab the
08:17 - target position and the current position
08:19 - to calate the move Direction then just
08:21 - take the set the physics velocity linear
08:24 - to that move Direction multiply by some
08:25 - kind of move speed and then using
08:27 - physics basically that's how it moves
08:28 - the unit so in terms of updating yeah
08:30 - you can definitely have a a bullan so if
08:34 - you use burst then inside of burst you
08:36 - cannot access other things but you could
08:38 - very much write this code inside of a
08:40 - job and you would have that job be bured
08:43 - but then over here on update you would
08:44 - take away the Burse compile and over
08:46 - here you can access some kind of
08:48 - instance last just like you just like
08:50 - you would on any normal C code so for
08:53 - example I've got the game assets class
08:54 - and this one is a standard mono Behavior
08:57 - class so you can access game objects and
08:59 - mod Behavior things from inside the
09:01 - entities code entities world so you can
09:04 - do that well Ring trailer drop is that
09:06 - true oh that's nice uh so you can access
09:09 - that or alternatively you can go for
09:10 - example from the system API in order to
09:12 - get the Singleton so you can have you
09:14 - can create a Singleton component meaning
09:16 - a component of which there exists only
09:18 - one thing and you can sort some kind of
09:20 - bulling there some kind of bulling fly
09:22 - for updating things or not and you can
09:24 - do get Singleton in order to find the
09:26 - component of that so let's say if I only
09:28 - had a single Target position
09:29 - then this would get that t position and
09:31 - then from that I could access some kind
09:33 - of field inside of it which could be a
09:35 - bullion and then depending on the value
09:36 - of that run this for each or not so yep
09:39 - plenty of ways to do all kinds of those
09:42 - things changing meshed material
09:45 - properties still look weak to me on dots
09:46 - yeah those are definitely still uh uh
09:49 - complicated that is also that is
09:51 - something that I very much want to try
09:52 - out in this uh uh in this uh live stream
09:56 - because yeah I've managed to figure out
09:58 - the idea for how it works and basically
10:01 - you need this you need the material mesh
10:02 - info this is a built-in thing from the
10:04 - unity rendering and you can basically go
10:06 - inside it and modify the mesh ID now
10:08 - that mesh ID that is not an actual mesh
10:10 - reference you have to basically register
10:12 - the mesh so over here I've got a B
10:14 - component which has a regular mesh and
10:17 - then there's a dots component which has
10:18 - a thing of type batch mesh ID and then
10:21 - over here I'm simply going through the
10:22 - en graph system in order to register the
10:24 - mesh which in turn returns this and then
10:26 - on this system I can use that film in
10:28 - order to mod modified mesh so this is
10:30 - how basically over here there's this
10:32 - little character it's being animated
10:33 - this is a fully dots character this is
10:35 - not a game object so this if I look
10:38 - inside of the runtime entity
10:40 - thing yep over there you can see yep it
10:43 - has the material mesh info and you can
10:44 - see over here the mesh index that one is
10:46 - modifying that One is updating between
10:48 - one and two that is how this one is
10:49 - doing some slight animation just
10:51 - changing meshes one uh uh just changing
10:55 - between meshes in order to make some
10:57 - kind of Animation so that is the rough
10:59 - idea how to change the color of a 2d
11:01 - Sprite but entity that's a good question
11:03 - because I still haven't yet looked into
11:05 - much on um on using Sprite render in
11:08 - dots I do believe it does work like I
11:10 - tried it and it seemed to work but so
11:11 - far I've been using just 3D elements so
11:14 - I'm not entirely sure but
11:17 - um so yeah I would have to look into
11:20 - that but if you're using a mesh then I
11:22 - do believe on one of these you can
11:23 - modify the uh material the same way that
11:26 - you would modify a mesh and that's only
11:28 - complex yeah right now for making
11:30 - animations inside of dots it is
11:31 - definitely very complex unnecessarily
11:34 - complex which is why it's on the road
11:36 - map for the next thing to do to actually
11:38 - have some built-in support for
11:39 - animations but so far you have to either
11:41 - do it manually like this or go on the
11:43 - accur and pick up one of the several
11:45 - assets that already exist that handle
11:47 - the animations right away and that is
11:49 - actually uh and it should work quite
11:51 - well I mean if I wasn't making a course
11:53 - if I was making this game just for
11:55 - myself just making a game to put on seam
11:56 - just a normal he T like a machine gun am
11:59 - I talking too fast uh so yeah if I was
12:01 - making this game just for myself I would
12:03 - definitely go on to the assur pick up
12:04 - one of those s in order to handle the
12:06 - dots animations but since it's a course
12:09 - on the course I don't want the course to
12:10 - be dependent on third party asset so
12:11 - that is why in the course I'm going to
12:13 - teach how to make uh normal animation
12:15 - and yep so this is the main method that
12:18 - I'm going for but anyways before that I
12:20 - really want to try this out look into
12:21 - how to handle events so let's see
12:25 - this and actually right now I think
12:30 - actually don't know if by default it is
12:31 - going to have some kind of thing and a
12:35 - non dos version of this that is actually
12:36 - an interesting question maybe if I can
12:38 - find the time I would like to uh
12:40 - basically remake the game using just
12:42 - game objects in order to see exactly
12:43 - what the difference is between dots and
12:44 - non dos that could be interesting
12:47 - although it might also be a ton of work
12:48 - so not entirely sure but it would
12:50 - definitely be a fun project okay so let
12:52 - me create a new system so test
12:55 - collisions system something like
12:57 - this and now inside of it so I don't
13:00 - need the on create I don't need that one
13:03 - and that one okay so now on the on
13:06 - update so basically I have to cycle
13:08 - through what is
13:10 - it okay I have to get the Singleton of
13:12 - type simulation Singleton so in the
13:14 - system API get Singleton of type
13:17 - simulation
13:18 - Singleton and on this one I call as
13:22 - simulation which apparently returns a
13:24 - simulation whatever that is and then I
13:26 - can get Collision events or trigger
13:28 - events so let's get the trigger events
13:30 - okay so this one I believe it says that
13:32 - it's going to be a collection which I
13:34 - then iterate through it uh on the
13:37 - trigger events let me inspect
13:40 - this uh it just has trigger events but
13:43 - how do
13:46 - I okay why is this commented that's a
13:49 - good question so is it
13:53 - innumerable or is it not inumerable
13:55 - that's interesting why is this why is
13:57 - this uh
14:03 - commented oh do I go through the and why
14:06 - is this commented okay that's a bit
14:09 - strange Firebase Google login system
14:12 - I've never really used Firebase so I
14:14 - don't really know how how that works but
14:17 - as far as I know they have some really
14:18 - great docks so I would definitely look
14:21 - into that look into the docks to see uh
14:23 - how it works okay so why is this one not
14:26 - so if I try doing a for each on this one
14:30 - for each trigger event trigger event in
14:34 - this is this going to work okay so I'm
14:37 - not entirely sure why this is working or
14:39 - rather I'm not entirely sure why why
14:42 - over here this one the uh trigger events
14:46 - why is this one commenting out the I
14:49 - numerator I have no idea but okay so if
14:51 - it works then maybe it works let's we
14:53 - debug down log on this trigger event and
14:57 - this trigger event has what oh it's got
14:59 - the entities that were involved the
15:01 - bodies and so on so just printing it out
15:04 - should print something just nope I don't
15:07 - want that one I want using Unity
15:10 - engine okay so doing a log and basically
15:12 - if there is a trigger vent then that's
15:14 - you me like can join live stream hey
15:17 - welcome Mara yeah it's uh it's a uh
15:23 - definitely would like to have a more
15:24 - regular live stream schedule but so far
15:26 - it is still very much random when it
15:29 - happens okay why are you
15:33 - having burst invalid argument okay I
15:36 - have no idea what that was but okay and
15:39 - this this uh down log just to make sure
15:41 - that this system is actually running cuz
15:45 - I think right now it won't be running
15:47 - but it's actually not going to have
15:48 - anything hey huge fan hey thanks uh
15:50 - thanks for watching the videos I Hope
15:52 - they've helped you quite a lot uh okay
15:56 - so the system is working but yep there's
15:58 - nothing actual happening all right good
16:00 - how do you record tutorial I use OBS to
16:03 - record the screen which uh the screen in
16:05 - the camera actually it all records the
16:07 - same thing and yeah which is actually a
16:10 - pretty awesome program super easy to use
16:12 - okay what do I want so let me create a
16:15 - new 3D
16:18 - cube okay let me put this one in
16:20 - authoring and for this Cube I'm going to
16:23 - make it a
16:26 - trigger and can I scale it will this
16:29 - actually scale I assume so
16:32 - okay so that one is basically going to
16:34 - be a trigger and then can I create a
16:37 - new a 3D object a
16:42 - sphere loging is better than debugger in
16:45 - dots oh interesting I'm not familiar
16:48 - with unity. logging I'm using this just
16:50 - for just for testing so I'm not too
16:52 - worried about about uh performance but
16:56 - what is Unity not logging there's a
16:58 - loging package okay I did not know about
17:03 - this is a versatile and highly
17:05 - configurable structured a synchronous
17:08 - logging
17:09 - solution okay so it should be good for
17:11 - logging inside of vered code inside of
17:14 - jobs I
17:16 - assume contains various ways to stream
17:18 - record the logs onto all kinds of things
17:21 - all right good The Collection package
17:23 - and can be used without
17:25 - ECS okay so that is actually interesting
17:28 - I did not know about so yeah thanks for
17:29 - the tip I'll definitely look into it
17:32 - afterwards cuz yeah I imagine that when
17:34 - using tons of jobs like so far I'm not
17:36 - using any jobs so I'm not using anything
17:39 - uh too insanely complex but yeah when
17:41 - using when using uh jobs look at that
17:44 - gifted memberships I didn't know that
17:47 - YouTube had such a thing all right uh
17:49 - thanks so much snar for the gifted
17:51 - memberships yeah what was this
17:54 - at okay I had no idea that's the first
17:57 - time that I that I've seen that but okay
17:59 - so apparently a bunch of people get
18:01 - gifted oh thank thanks so much snar for
18:04 - the Super Chat and the gifted
18:06 - memberships okay that is that's an
18:09 - interesting one yeah I thought only
18:11 - twitch had because as far as I know
18:14 - YouTube live streams are still very much
18:16 - behind in terms of uh having all kinds
18:19 - of features but apparently it has gifted
18:21 - memberships okay so that's that's fun
18:23 - yeah thanks that should be should be
18:26 - quite
18:27 - interesting uh uh okay let me just add a
18:30 - rigid
18:31 - body just to make this one fall down so
18:34 - now if I render where's my sphere and
18:36 - put the sphere right there let me
18:37 - actually change the material do I have
18:39 - my bullet material somewhere my bullet
18:42 - material just make it nice and
18:44 - visible okay and make it quite a bit
18:48 - bigger okay so let's see if the okay it
18:51 - falls down goes goes through it oh right
18:54 - cuz the bottom is not dots based yep it
18:56 - did work it did find a trigger event
18:59 - all right awesome so that's apparently
19:01 - because it goes in and yep it does
19:02 - trigger a trigger event all right so
19:04 - right away that is uh quite
19:07 - good recently started using Unity for
19:09 - university project your tutorials have
19:11 - been a lifesaver nice maybe I'll start
19:12 - making projects on my own too yeah
19:14 - definitely go for it that's awesome yeah
19:16 - uh great job on starting your Learning
19:19 - Journey yeah now just continue and keep
19:22 - at it keep on learning
19:26 - um any forign lessons on Mark marketing
19:29 - nice yeah marketing does one of those
19:30 - things extremely important and extremely
19:32 - difficult so yeah
19:34 - uh uh where was I I'm to following the
19:37 - the route of a Game Dev who makes lots
19:39 - of small games instead of dream games
19:41 - and that really helps nice nice that's
19:45 - awesome yeah definitely making small
19:47 - games making multiple games helps you
19:49 - quite a lot in in uh being able to in
19:53 - being able to learn ton of things not
19:55 - just marketing but everything but yeah
19:57 - in terms of marketing is one those
19:58 - things that is definitely really tricky
20:01 - uh it is it is something that I amazed
20:04 - myself at how much I did not know like
20:06 - when I when I started making games on on
20:08 - Steam which to be fair back then in 2013
20:11 - there wasn't necessarily as much
20:13 - competition as there is nowadays so back
20:15 - then for the first few games that I did
20:17 - I could get away with not knowing much
20:18 - about marketing but yeah since then I
20:20 - definitely have had to learn quite a lot
20:22 - and yeah it is something very important
20:24 - so yeah definitely uh keep on learning
20:27 - that because yeah marketing is indeed
20:29 - quite important uh okay so let me just
20:31 - let me just see this
20:34 - um
20:36 - say oh sarf yeah thank you so much yeah
20:39 - although it's kind of strange how you
20:41 - gifted memberships but apparently it
20:42 - doesn't give yourself one that's a bit
20:45 - on so it like gifts uh five memberships
20:48 - but you yourself don't keep one of those
20:51 - I would have assumed that if someone
20:52 - give some memberships it would the
20:55 - system would first give that person the
20:57 - the membership before giving someone
20:59 - else but okay I wonder if that's
21:02 - different from how it is on on Twitch
21:04 - that's definitely an interesting thing
21:06 - so but yeah uh thanks so much for the
21:09 - isn't it NTB it isn't oh I forgot to
21:12 - pause uh so yeah thanks so much that is
21:15 - nice um okay so just verifying that this
21:19 - is indeed working which I believe it is
21:21 - working so let me go and that one falls
21:24 - down and touches and as soon as it
21:25 - touches yep got a collision between 381
21:27 - and 382
21:29 - and if I go and I see the cube in the
21:31 - sphere let's see which one this is so go
21:33 - inside of runtime and this one is 382
21:36 - and sphere yep it is 381 all right
21:39 - awesome so the Collision is indeed
21:40 - working so basically this is how you
21:42 - test for collisions which is actually
21:45 - uh really surprisingly simple yeah I
21:48 - thought handling collisions would have
21:50 - been quite sub to you on my other
21:52 - account by one bite okay awesome yeah
21:55 - thanks uh so yeah I thought collisions
21:58 - would be
21:59 - uh quite difficult but apparently not
22:00 - apparently it's literally just one line
22:02 - of code although uh if you want to make
22:05 - it super fast then yeah they recommend
22:06 - over here oh where did I click they
22:09 - recommend over here that you should be
22:10 - using a collision event job or a trigger
22:12 - event job but for simple things actually
22:15 - this is uh surprisingly easy so yeah
22:17 - there you go that's collisions
22:18 - surprisingly easy let me actually just
22:21 - copy paste this code for my own notes
22:23 - cuz I was working on uh making a video
22:26 - talking about the basics of not
22:30 - physics so let me just copy paste this
22:33 - code on there just so I remember just
22:35 - how easy it is although it does have one
22:37 - issue which is how since Do's physics is
22:40 - stateless meaning it has no state that
22:42 - is why this one over here this trigger
22:45 - vent doesn't actually contain that much
22:46 - information so it has
22:48 - the oh the event dat I wonder what that
22:50 - is I wonder why I can't access it but
22:52 - yeah so this one has an entity another
22:54 - entity a body another body so C the keys
22:57 - and so on
22:59 - but yeah it doesn't have anything to say
23:00 - okay this is an ont trigger enter or on
23:02 - trigger exit event or on trigger St it
23:05 - doesn't mention any of that so it just a
23:06 - trigger vent and that is all the
23:09 - information you get so you basically
23:11 - need to and I actually was seeing I was
23:14 - watching this super useful video
23:16 - actually by unity Japan which is quite
23:20 - surprising how Unity has a Japanese uh
23:24 - Channel which is separate it's presented
23:26 - by KIRO make some really great videos uh
23:30 - and uh it's on subtitle so actually if
23:32 - you want to learn Unity I can also say
23:34 - this channel is really awesome so on
23:37 - this one yeah talking about how do cuz
23:40 - he mentioned over here there was
23:42 - a a helper function of
23:47 - something get Singleton get the
23:52 - objects yes so basally teaching how to
23:54 - make the the things so oh another
23:58 - another thanks uh oh boy way too many
24:02 - tabs yeah one bite thanks so much let's
24:05 - do another gift ah thank you thanks so
24:07 - much that that's really nice only moolly
24:10 - white ID yep my brain only works on the
24:12 - or rather my eyes only work on the white
24:14 - ID so if I try to look at dark mode I
24:18 - very quickly get very messed up get
24:20 - massive headaches so yep for me it has
24:22 - to be okay so I think it's at the
24:24 - stateful trigger event authoring which
24:27 - apparent I know if that's a built-in
24:29 - thing or if that is something
24:32 - that flashbang for some of us yeah I'm
24:35 - sorry about that I wish I could make it
24:38 - different for myself and for you but
24:41 - nope sorry for the spam not spam at all
24:44 - yeah thank you so much I hope you I hope
24:46 - my videos have helped you quite a lot so
24:48 - yeah thanks so much uh uh what was the
24:51 - component let me just see see if this
24:53 - one does
24:55 - work state fall trigger event authoring
24:57 - although I think think this one stap
24:59 - full yeah doesn't have here so I think
25:01 - this one is on the on the uh official
25:03 - dot samples so I have to look into those
25:06 - in order to look at these um helper
25:09 - functions cuz these do seem to be uh
25:11 - quite useful so let's
25:13 - see I think it is a trigger State
25:15 - Collision save by default yep that is
25:17 - that is correct so basically over here
25:19 - the uh the Collision this one is going
25:21 - to fire for as long as the trigger is
25:23 - happening so but yeah you can't yeah you
25:25 - need to handle something in order to
25:27 - figure out okay this just stting so this
25:29 - is an enter this just ended so it's an
25:31 - exit and so on so yeah definitely so
25:35 - yeah those helper functions are probably
25:36 - going to be very useful so I definitely
25:38 - have to look into the uh sample project
25:39 - in order to see that but yeah just just
25:42 - by default I'm surprised at how easy it
25:43 - is to uh listen to Collision events just
25:47 - a uh a simple system a symol for each
25:50 - that actually works so that's
25:53 - nice how do you record do you speak and
25:55 - record at the same time or first record
25:57 - and speak
25:59 - I record and speak at the same time so
26:01 - First I write the entire script for the
26:03 - video tutorial whatever it is I write
26:05 - the entire script then I have the script
26:06 - over here on my second Monitor and I'm
26:07 - recording the main monitor as I'm uh
26:10 - reading the script doing the tutorial
26:12 - while also maybe having the camera on
26:14 - and so on so yeah basically do a ton of
26:16 - work beforehand and then for recording
26:18 - just press record read the script do the
26:20 - thing and yep that's kind of how it goes
26:23 - in Japan channel is even better than the
26:25 - official Unity yeah it does have a lot
26:27 - of really some things it's quite it's
26:30 - quite surprising how this is a separate
26:32 - Channel I mean makes sense cuz it's uh
26:34 - in Japanese but it all has excellent
26:36 - subtitle so yeah I'm guessing many of
26:39 - you many people do not know that uh this
26:41 - channel exists but I definitely I
26:43 - recommend you look into it because they
26:44 - do have some really awesome uh tutorials
26:48 - lots of things and it's all nicely
26:50 - subtitled so yeah really great Learning
26:52 - Channel has quite a lot more learning
26:54 - things than the normal uh thing
27:00 - [Music]
27:01 - dos is so difficult yes or no uh it's a
27:05 - different type of thinking but once you
27:07 - start thinking in a different way it is
27:09 - not necessarily that much more difficult
27:12 - so you have to switch your brain in
27:14 - thinking a different way but once you do
27:17 - once you understand how all the syntax
27:19 - Works doing a doing a simple query or
27:21 - accessing Singleton queries on the
27:23 - system API and so on a lot of the things
27:25 - are actually relatively uh simple so
27:30 - yeah okay wow another five wow so it
27:35 - went from not knowing this feature
27:36 - existed to all of a sudden being used
27:39 - three times during during one live
27:41 - stream so so thank you Ma thanks so
27:44 - much it's uh it's actually really funny
27:47 - cuz yeah I hadn't seen I did not know
27:49 - that this was a thing that existed so
27:51 - yeah thanks you so much babyon bite my
27:53 - Jean thanks to all of you this has
27:56 - definitely been quite fun yeah Ma thank
27:59 - you nice uh I don't like read
28:02 - documentation just focus in general I
28:04 - have ADHD not to crud myself but it's
28:06 - difficult to be able to read
28:07 - documentation or guide chat GPT is a
28:09 - blessing I mean uh to uh to that I would
28:12 - say whatever helps you so if you prefer
28:14 - using chat GPD and if you find that that
28:16 - helps absolutely go ahead and use that I
28:18 - mean uh me personally the main way that
28:20 - I like to learn is by watching videos
28:22 - which is probably obvious given the fact
28:24 - that I make uh tutorial videos basically
28:26 - that is the way that I like to learn so
28:27 - the first thing I do do whenever I go to
28:28 - learn something I go on YouTube I find
28:30 - all kinds of videos tutorials to teach
28:32 - whatever it is that I'm trying to learn
28:34 - however when it comes to things like
28:35 - this dots there's really not that much
28:37 - uh educational content around or rather
28:40 - the things that exist they are a bit
28:41 - outdated so I do still watch those but
28:43 - then I've got to go uh read the entire
28:46 - documentation in order to figure out how
28:47 - it all works which thankfully Unity
28:50 - actually does have pretty good
28:51 - documentations over here the the physics
28:54 - package this one is actually
28:55 - surprisingly good and same thing for the
28:57 - uh uh Unity entities package that one
29:00 - also has a really great so you go up
29:02 - here put in version 1.2 and Y this one
29:05 - has a getting started guide it has all
29:07 - kinds of things how to install all the
29:09 - various things all the concepts for how
29:11 - everything works so the documentation is
29:13 - actually surprisingly in-depth very
29:16 - detailed so but yeah uh definitely I
29:18 - also very much prefer uh watching a
29:20 - video as opposed to following reading
29:23 - just documentation but if there are no
29:24 - videos then has to be documentation so
29:26 - it's a little bit more difficult but you
29:28 - can definitely you can definitely do
29:32 - it uh are you able to make a guide video
29:35 - on how to do your research uh it's a
29:38 - good question but I think that would be
29:40 - a tricky thing to put on a v i mean how
29:41 - do you do my research is exactly what
29:43 - I'm doing right now which is I look at
29:45 - documentation I try to read the syntax
29:48 - then I go into n project start writing
29:50 - down some code and figure out how it
29:51 - works so that is roughly how I do it but
29:54 - yeah doing a video just on that it's a
29:56 - bit it's one of those things that is
29:57 - quite tricking to make into a video but
30:01 - uh but in terms of uh how I learn yeah
30:05 - that's pretty much it read documentation
30:07 - write some code go back and forth and so
30:09 - on
30:11 - yeah I guess it feels like there's a
30:13 - cheat code I mean there's really not
30:14 - it's one of those things where the main
30:15 - thing is really just uh just experience
30:19 - so the more the more things you make the
30:21 - more time you spend making things easier
30:23 - it becomes to learn new things so by now
30:26 - I've already learned many many new
30:28 - things I've made many many uh games so
30:30 - anytime that I'm doing something new
30:32 - it's just basically doing the same thing
30:34 - that I've already done many many times
30:35 - when I've learn many many other things
30:37 - so yeah at some point learning also
30:40 - becomes a skill that you also can get
30:42 - quite a bit better at okay let me just
30:45 - uh try to see okay that one Supply
30:46 - defense is working okay let me just uh
30:50 - try to let me let me think for a little
30:52 - bit on how I'm going to Handel the the
30:56 - thing five more
30:58 - thanks so much yeah yeah thanks I I hope
31:02 - my hope my answers have helped you uh
31:06 - that's still missing key features such
31:07 - as animation particles I actually think
31:09 - particles are super I'm not 100% sure
31:11 - but I think so but yeah animations
31:13 - doesn't when someone have an idea about
31:15 - a game and has so many objects and that
31:17 - objects have so many animations and
31:18 - particles can it be done yes it can be
31:21 - done and like I was saying you a while
31:23 - ago so for this course I'm going to
31:24 - implement a simple animation system
31:26 - which is exactly what I have here so
31:28 - it's all based on very low frame rate
31:30 - just swapping meshes back and forth so
31:32 - basically before a while ago when I was
31:34 - doing some research I baked a bunch of
31:37 - meshes so there it is so instead of
31:39 - having a skin mesh renderer that moves
31:41 - the bones and modifies all kinds of
31:42 - things and I instead I baked uh those
31:45 - animations I baked them into meshes so
31:47 - now for handling the animation basically
31:49 - what I'm going to do is just swap out
31:50 - the meshes between the various enties
31:52 - but if I wasn't doing this for a course
31:54 - then asset store unity.com
31:58 - if I was making this for a course if I
31:59 - was making it for my own game uh ECS
32:02 - animation there's a bunch of really
32:04 - awesome animation systems these are
32:06 - based on GPU so basically they render
32:08 - the uh skin mesh render all those vertex
32:11 - positions they render those onto a
32:13 - texture and then use that texture with a
32:15 - a custom Shader in order to read the
32:17 - texture and modify the vertices to to
32:20 - actually trigger the animation oh crap
32:23 - cooking settings um so yeah basically if
32:26 - I wasn't making this for the course and
32:28 - this is ex what I would do use one of
32:29 - these systems which already Works quite
32:31 - well but in order for the course to not
32:33 - be dependent on third party assets over
32:35 - here I'm going to do some very simple
32:37 - just based on swapping meeses okay so
32:39 - let me try to let me try to figure out
32:41 - how am I going to implement this okay so
32:44 - CU I was making a test animation so
32:46 - thanks so much Ma uh so basically I
32:50 - already had this one where I baked a
32:51 - bunch of meshes now the question is
32:53 - going to be how do I store the me one
32:55 - really tricky thing about dots is how
32:57 - you can't can't really have lists
32:58 - because lists
33:00 - are uh lists don't have a fixed size
33:04 - whereas in thatt you can't have Dynamic
33:06 - buffers but I don't think a dynamic
33:08 - buffer of a mesh would work well
33:11 - so so I
33:18 - think vertex animation textures better
33:21 - option if looking for performance AI uh
33:24 - uh vertex animation that is uh exactly
33:27 - how how those asset Works they render
33:30 - the the thing onto a I don't think it
33:32 - shows here yeah basically they render it
33:34 - onto a texture and then texture does
33:36 - some vertex animation in order to move
33:38 - the vertices and that's how it moves so
33:39 - yeah that is why that is how that one
33:41 - managed to be quite good blob asset
33:46 - reference uh yeah I don't
33:48 - think uh storing a mesh in a blob
33:52 - asset okay I think maybe this one of
33:55 - those scenarios where I'm overthinking
33:56 - things a little bit so I'm going to any
33:59 - channel member hey Alex hey thanks so
34:01 - much for becoming Channel member
34:04 - uh okay so let me try to think for a
34:07 - little
34:08 - bit okay I think I'm just going to make
34:10 - some
34:14 - uh okay cool um there's un sample code
34:19 - but skin Mees m oh is there oh I did not
34:22 - I did not know background dog is made by
34:25 - dogs yes it's my dog walking around on
34:27 - this floor he makes quite a bit of
34:30 - noise
34:32 - uh Rec working on the console version of
34:35 - dinky Gardens uh that's my plan but yeah
34:37 - right now definitely on pause so yeah I
34:40 - was planning to to work on that after
34:42 - finishing the C course but in the time
34:45 - between that un6 preview came out so I
34:48 - got I had to uh I started working on
34:51 - this so yeah very much still want to do
34:53 - it but yeah it's uh ah tricky so many
34:56 - things that I want to do okay
34:58 - so I think I'm going to simply just have
35:01 - a fields for
35:03 - everything I think that is going to be
35:05 - the S thing so for example put Marine
35:08 - idle zero then Marine idle one and then
35:12 - I'm going to
35:13 - have let's just say the W uh Marine walk
35:18 - zero I think it has one two three just
35:21 - three just three okay so now up here let
35:24 - me do all those so I got Marine idle
35:28 - zero idle one Marine walk zero 1 2 3 one
35:33 - two and three okay so now here let me
35:37 - put all those so the idle
35:40 - one then the won zero won one so
35:44 - basically this is rendering rendering
35:45 - not uh registering all the meshes with
35:49 - the render
35:51 - system okay so
35:53 - now so basically this one stores
36:02 - okay let me think so basically I need to
36:04 - keep track of the current frame that I'm
36:07 - playing the current animation as
36:11 - well so I need some kind of inum for the
36:14 - animation type so let's say Marine Idol
36:18 - and Marine won okay so I need that and
36:21 - then I need a float for the animation
36:24 - timer something like
36:26 - that then some animation timer Max in
36:29 - order to know when to swap to the next
36:30 - frame and then I need an INT for the
36:33 - current frame and then I'm going to need
36:36 - some kind
36:37 - of function in order to get the next
36:41 - frame which I shouldn't be putting logic
36:43 - in this so I'm going to have to refactor
36:46 - this afterwards
36:52 - because and let me sort the uh public
36:56 - animation type and animation type so I
36:58 - store the animation type I store the
37:00 - current frame the timer which I'm going
37:01 - to increase and the timer Max and so on
37:03 - so basically this one is going to set
37:05 - and it's going
37:06 - to so let's say for example I just need
37:09 - to set the timer Max and let's say at
37:11 - 0.5 so basically every .5 seconds it is
37:14 - supposed to swap out and for the
37:17 - animation
37:18 - type for this one let's put on the
37:21 - Marine idle okay so let me let me think
37:23 - okay so basally I've got a type so I
37:24 - know which animation I'm supposed to
37:28 - yeah basally I'm going to need some kind
37:30 - of
37:32 - uh platform as the me sorry I'm trying
37:35 - to trying to focus so I'm not reading
37:37 - much of chat right now uh what platform
37:40 - will the RTS course it will be on my own
37:43 - website because I'm going to try to do
37:46 - basically make the course a normal paid
37:47 - premium course but then also have a uh
37:49 - free version on YouTube with like I
37:51 - don't know the first half of the course
37:52 - something like that so yeah in order to
37:54 - do that kind of uh special thing yeah it
37:56 - has to be just on my website because yud
37:59 - me does not
38:00 - allow uh making a free version and a
38:02 - paid version at the same time so in
38:04 - order to do something like that yeah
38:06 - it's basically going to be on my website
38:08 - with a free version over here which
38:10 - should be hopefully should allow lots of
38:12 - people to learn quite a
38:18 - lot okay let me just let me just
38:22 - uh okay so I've got the animation tab so
38:24 - I know that I'm running this animation I
38:25 - know basically I need to get what is the
38:27 - next frame but I don't think
38:32 - uh so I'm trying to think do I put this
38:34 - inside a scripal
38:36 - object because a scripal object could
38:39 - hold the
38:44 - various okay anyways maybe I'm I think
38:49 - I'm no cuz the issue is cuz I've got the
38:52 - uh
38:57 - okay now this
39:00 - is ah okay I think I'm I think I'm
39:03 - thinking way too far ahead I think I'm
39:04 - just going to have a bunch of ifs and
39:07 - then see how it goes so anyways okay
39:10 - so okay so on this one let me get rid of
39:12 - my testing code for is mesh one the
39:14 - timer and so on okay and for the timer
39:17 - timer is not going to be that so the
39:19 - anime test let me grab it with a ref R
39:21 - so that I can actually write onto it
39:24 - okay so I've got that one good and so
39:27 - I'm going to go into the animate text
39:29 - animate test and let me grab the value r
39:32 - w grab the timer minus or plus equals go
39:35 - up time no not time uh system api. time.
39:39 - time okay so increase it by time and if
39:43 - this one if it is above the animation
39:46 - timer max if so then let's count it down
39:50 - so on this one uh minus equals the
39:55 - animation timer Max okay loop back the
39:57 - time and then modify the mesh so now
40:00 - here's when I have to
40:02 - do
40:04 - uh the tricky thing is that over here I
40:07 - have to do a switch go inside of that
40:09 - one go inside the value R just read in
40:11 - order to grab the animation type and
40:13 - then I do a case case I'm on Marine idle
40:16 - if I am on Marine idle then I basally
40:18 - want to get the
40:21 - next so I guess I can go on this one dot
40:26 - the current frame and I can do current
40:28 - frame Plus+ okay which I believe like
40:31 - this uh it should work okay so I grabb
40:33 - that one but now I need to know the
40:35 - frame
40:40 - Max okay so in frame
40:44 - Max uh so that one has two so then I
40:48 - have to set this one equals this one
40:51 - remainder of the frame Max no not that
40:55 - oh crap I I declared it over here now I
40:58 - got the
40:59 - int frame Max equals z let put a default
41:03 - on this one and put frame Max equals to
41:07 - okay so counting up the timer okay when
41:10 - goes past the maximum reset the timer
41:12 - okay then increase the next frame and
41:14 - then go back to that but now over here I
41:16 - need another switch so yeah I'm
41:17 - definitely going to need to rethink this
41:19 - code quite a lot cuz yeah I don't want
41:21 - to have tons of switches this definitely
41:24 - uh not looking very good but so over
41:27 - here I can do a switch on the uh animate
41:31 - test. Val R let's grab the current frame
41:34 - and case I'm on frame zero case I am on
41:37 - frame zero then over here I'm going to
41:39 - set this guy so I'm going to set that
41:42 - one and my test like grab for the Marine
41:45 - idle zero do that one do a break and K
41:48 - on one then I'm going to grab that one
41:51 - like
41:52 - that okay so I think like this it should
41:56 - work
42:01 - okay I think like this it should work so
42:02 - basically I'm grabbing all those I'm
42:04 - increasing the timer okay when it goes
42:05 - above I reset the timer I increase the
42:07 - current frame then I grab the remainder
42:09 - in order to make sure it never goes
42:10 - above and then I do a thing let me just
42:12 - do a default just to be safe and
42:14 - Visually goes onto that one or that one
42:17 - okay so I think like this it should work
42:20 - I can live with a white theme that is
42:21 - because the dark mode burns my eyes so
42:25 - the same way that I'm assuming like you
42:26 - are saying I'm assuming you are the kind
42:28 - of person who cannot live with white
42:30 - theme well I'm the same way just the
42:32 - other way around I cannot live with dark
42:35 - mode all right so let's put both of
42:38 - those and that
42:40 - should trigger which should make this
42:43 - guy
42:46 - you all right good awesome so basally
42:50 - just spent a bunch of time in order to
42:51 - get the exact same result so the same
42:53 - character is inating okay good but now
42:56 - that I done that now I can basically
42:58 - continue doing the exact same thing oh
43:00 - but yeah I'm really going to need to
43:02 - refactor this code otherwise it's going
43:04 - to be a huge mess because yeah then I've
43:07 - got to do a switch on the animate test
43:10 - let's grab the value Aro let's grab the
43:11 - current frame and do a default do a k
43:14 - zero and case it is on zero then I have
43:16 - to go into that one and over here grab
43:19 - the Marine walk zero case one two and
43:22 - three then pick up that one two and
43:25 - three and three three and two and one
43:29 - and then up here on this one so this one
43:31 - has four animations so if I go in the
43:33 - Marine won this one has four frames all
43:36 - right awesome that's
43:39 - cool um someone asking if we're going to
43:42 - release total World Liberation that is
43:44 - my goal is to get back to that game on
43:46 - the second half of this year so I don't
43:48 - know around September October that's
43:51 - kind of my goal around that time go back
43:53 - into that game cuz I really enjoy it I
43:55 - really uh I still love the idea behind
43:57 - that game I definitely it is something
43:59 - that I want to do so yeah right now the
44:02 - goal the plan is to get back to it on
44:04 - the second half this year and hopefully
44:06 - it should be fun so hopefully I don't
44:08 - know maybe by this time next year no I
44:10 - think that's a bit too early I was going
44:12 - to say by this time next year maybe it
44:13 - won't be out but if I start but if I get
44:15 - back to it in September probably not
44:16 - going to be done by May so maybe by like
44:19 - I don't know June August of next year
44:22 - maybe something like that it might be
44:24 - out so that could be that could be fun
44:26 - okay let me just I just need to expose
44:29 - the other thing so on this one up here
44:31 - let me make a public animate test.
44:35 - animation type animation type and then I
44:38 - just got to oh yeah B that one with that
44:41 - one with the authoring the animation
44:44 - type
44:47 - okay uh where was I sorry so many so
44:51 - many comments that I'm trying to oh the
44:53 - new member hey thank you so much
44:55 - sved uh ACV pet D okay yeah thank you so
45:00 - much uh sorry I'm trying to trying to do
45:04 - work whilst trying to read questions at
45:07 - the same time is a little bit tricky and
45:09 - did my did the unit just vanish or did
45:12 - my yeah I'm just the other way around
45:14 - okay so let me just a quick test so if I
45:16 - go there I swap that one into Marine
45:18 - walk and now
45:21 - nice all right it does seem to work so
45:23 - there you go that's the won animation
45:27 - which I believe it is working correctly
45:29 - yeah it's a very janky walk animation so
45:31 - I definitely need to make it a little
45:32 - bit faster just to make it look a little
45:34 - bit better but
45:36 - yeah the logic does work so let me try
45:39 - making it just a little bit faster so
45:40 - maybe just two so maybe just run at uh
45:44 - five frames per second and it should
45:48 - look a little bit nice but yeah yeah
45:50 - it's always awesome to write brand new
45:52 - code and see how everything works it's
45:54 - changing the legs right yes it is it
45:58 - just looks a bit oddd since it's all in
46:01 - but yeah it is using left right left
46:03 - right so yeah does work there you go
46:05 - some nice dots animation and if I just
46:07 - well actually if I swap this one it
46:08 - won't change but can I modify it over
46:12 - here okay modify it into the idle there
46:14 - you go on the idle animation nice see
46:17 - here's a nice uh animation system so by
46:19 - swapping out this enum all of a sudden
46:22 - it is going between that one okay so now
46:24 - that the is too fast yeah it is Jing
46:27 - from that one and that one
46:29 - okay uh what are the specs of your PC
46:32 - that's a good question uh I don't know
46:34 - cuz it's been a long time since I've
46:37 - bought it uh it's
46:40 - the I don't know it's an AMD CPU sorry I
46:43 - don't remember it's been like this PC is
46:45 - like 5 years old still awesome though so
46:47 - yeah it's uh it's the and the graphics
46:50 - card is a 3080 I think so that one is
46:52 - pretty good that one was 3080 or
46:55 - 2080 I know but the graphics the
46:58 - graphics card was very expensive at
47:00 - times so that was definitely quite
47:01 - tricky um did you use OBS for streaming
47:05 - live yep I'm using OBS right now it is
47:07 - really awesome it gets the camera input
47:09 - it gets the the uh the uh screen view so
47:13 - yep I use OBS both for both for uh
47:16 - recording and for doing live stream so
47:18 - that's really
47:21 - awesome uh sorry to ask again if vertex
47:24 - animation textures are good is it somewh
47:26 - to if it's only animation
47:28 - performance I'm not sure what you mean
47:30 - by that I mean vertex
47:33 - animations do you mean for skin mesh
47:35 - renders because if you use a skin mesh
47:37 - render you are still going to use Game
47:38 - objects and if you use game objects you
47:40 - are still going to have some limitations
47:42 - as to um as to how many units you can
47:45 - have on screen so if you are rendering a
47:49 - a you got a 390 yeah I think that's
47:51 - right how do you know better than me I
47:53 - don't know but yeah thank you yeah I
47:56 - think I do have a 39 I I get confused um
47:59 - so yeah basically if you use vertex
48:00 - animations with textures it w be very
48:02 - fast for the animation but if the whole
48:04 - thing is still based on game objects you
48:05 - are still going to have some limitations
48:07 - there not as much as if you were using
48:09 - normal skin mesh renders but you are
48:11 - still going to have some limitations for
48:12 - using Game objects as opposed to doing
48:14 - everything dot space so if you want to
48:17 - push the unit amount to the absolute Max
48:19 - then yeah it does help for everything to
48:21 - be based on based on uh
48:24 - dots can ask if it's possible to use
48:27 - your utils in published games and also
48:28 - if there's any existing videos on utils
48:30 - yep definitely go ahead and use the
48:31 - utilities or any code in any of my
48:33 - tutorials in your own in your own games
48:35 - free or commercial doesn't matter I hope
48:37 - I hope they help you a lot and uh yeah I
48:39 - don't have anything that is too uh
48:42 - explanatory on it but the utilities they
48:44 - do have quite a lot of uh comments on
48:46 - the various uh classes so if you just
48:49 - explore all those functions hopefully
48:51 - they should be well named so that you
48:52 - can easily understand what they're all
48:54 - doing
48:57 - sorry so many questions I'm I'm trying
48:58 - to keep up
49:01 - uh does that support Unity visual
49:04 - scripting I mean visual scripting can
49:06 - can work with any kind of code you can
49:09 - you can use visual scripting interact
49:10 - with any kind of C class so in that way
49:13 - you can kind of do it but uh visual
49:15 - scripting is very much based on objects
49:18 - so I'm not sure you
49:20 - can I'm not sure you can do much uh
49:24 - visual scripting plus entities by itself
49:27 - but you could definitely have some in
49:29 - between C Class where the visual
49:30 - scripting interacts with that C class
49:32 - which in turn interacts with ECS worldl
49:34 - so that can work quite uh that can be
49:37 - one option but at that time if you're
49:39 - doing that might as well just be better
49:41 - just to use code by itself so I'm not
49:44 - too
49:46 - sure okay so let me just
49:50 - uh let me try to apply this animation
49:53 - system to all of my characters so if I
49:55 - grab one of my unit so let me remember
49:57 - what do I need to to make this work and
50:01 - I'm pretty sure that all I need is just
50:02 - a mesh filter a mesh render and this
50:04 - component okay so actually if I copy
50:08 - this
50:09 - component okay now I'm trying to think
50:12 - cuz on on this one if I go inside my
50:14 - unit inside my unit I've got a capsule
50:17 - okay let me make just a well let me
50:18 - actually just duplicate the capsule
50:21 - animated mesh and on this one let me
50:23 - just attach the component is this it if
50:26 - I do this will this work that's a good
50:29 - question I don't know let me so on the
50:32 - capsule let me modify this let me put a
50:34 - a cube just make sure that it's not
50:35 - Runing the
50:37 - capsule okay so it's running Cube but
50:39 - this Cube should then swap out and let's
50:41 - see and yeah it does work all right
50:44 - awesome so obviously need uh a bunch of
50:46 - things but yeah the logic does work okay
50:49 - so let me uh let me see how much do I it
50:53 - weighs oh no it's the animated mesh that
50:56 - I moved it upwards okay so I got to move
50:58 - it well not move it down I got to put it
50:59 - on 0 0 okay so let me just oh did I move
51:03 - this
51:04 - one did this apply an override oh it did
51:08 - oh that's
51:09 - interesting okay move it back okay good
51:13 - let me go inside the prefab open the
51:15 - prefab and on this one let's put it on
51:17 - zero and let me actually put the other
51:19 - mesh so the Marine
51:22 - idle and all I'm missing is just the
51:24 - material so let me go ahead and grab the
51:27 - material so just copy this
51:29 - material go onto that one onto the go
51:32 - inside the prefab and on the animated
51:34 - mesh and paste of material and let's put
51:36 - it like this and there you go now all of
51:38 - them have that and all of them are
51:39 - walking and all of them are still units
51:41 - so everything still work okay so I got
51:43 - to I got to play around with the
51:45 - orientation and yeah then I just have to
51:47 - modify that that enum to make it work
51:50 - but yeah for the most part yeah
51:53 - animations are roughly working so that's
51:55 - awesome that is cool
51:59 - okay
52:01 - uh a weird question but did you share a
52:03 - computer with someone when you were
52:05 - young uh technically yes I mean back
52:08 - when I was very young when I was like 10
52:09 - years old I had a brother and we only
52:12 - had one computer so I guess so although
52:14 - my brother was more outgoing so I had a
52:17 - lot of time just in the computer by
52:20 - myself and then later on we had two
52:22 - computers so yeah I guess I guess in the
52:24 - beginning we had uh a little bit
52:28 - but how do you do the unit selection in
52:31 - dots the answer is actually initially I
52:36 - I started doing a physics query in order
52:38 - to do a uh a uh what do you call it a
52:41 - box cast a overlap box on the world but
52:43 - then I figured out that there's actually
52:45 - one interesting thing so oh and I didn't
52:47 - notice a new member cute so thanks again
52:49 - ACV
52:51 - petd uh thanks so much and you member
52:54 - the qua yeah thanks so much uh uh what
52:57 - was I saying oh right so initially I was
52:59 - using actually doing a box CEST so as I
53:01 - was moving this if you saw the first
53:03 - live stream that I did on this project
53:05 - you will have seen that so as I was
53:07 - doing the selection it was actually uh
53:08 - placing and moving a a cube directly
53:11 - inside the 3D scene but if the camera is
53:14 - slightly rotated then that doesn't
53:15 - actually work cuz if I was making a cube
53:17 - from here to here it would actually be
53:19 - kind of like this at an angle and would
53:21 - not actually uh hit the positions as it
53:24 - should be so basically for the in
53:25 - selection I have to basically just do
53:27 - this little square all of this is
53:29 - handled on the UI itself and then for
53:31 - the logic so on the uh what did I call
53:33 - it the unit selection manager not this
53:37 - one the unit selection
53:39 - manager okay so basically on this one so
53:42 - I've got basically I get the mouse down
53:44 - Mouse up and I get the mouse screen
53:46 - position that is the important thing it
53:48 - is the screen position not the world
53:49 - position and then basically I calculate
53:51 - a rectangle so using the screen lower
53:54 - left corner and the upper right corner
53:55 - in order to calculate the the selection
53:57 - rectangle and then I instead of doing a
54:01 - physics query instead of that uh where
54:03 - is it that's the
54:05 - movement and for the
54:10 - selection uh where's
54:12 - the right here it is so for selecting
54:15 - multiple units basically I find the
54:17 - units that have a friendly component so
54:19 - this is actually one thing that I still
54:21 - probably have to figure out some
54:22 - optimization cuz over here it is
54:24 - basically just going through all the
54:25 - units that can be selected
54:27 - and then simply does a world to screen
54:29 - point so basically converts their world
54:31 - coordinates into screen coordinates and
54:33 - then checks if those screen coordinates
54:34 - are within that selection rectangle and
54:36 - if so then select this unit and if not
54:38 - then don't select it so yeah that is one
54:41 - one example of something that I started
54:44 - off with an interesting approach then
54:45 - realize that approach did not work and
54:47 - then have to come up with something
54:48 - different so yep that is how it works
54:50 - right now so make a a square and yep I
54:53 - can select all the units and all of
54:55 - those that are inside the Square get
54:56 - selected and ones outside do not so yep
54:59 - that was an an interesting thing that
55:01 - took a bunch of iterations in order to
55:02 - make it work but now it is working quite
55:07 - well physics s is so bad I Implement my
55:09 - own kd3 and end up being a thousand
55:11 - times faster isn't I haven't done any
55:14 - any uh uh performance tests so yeah I'm
55:18 - curious to see I'm curious to take this
55:21 - uh uh when this project is done I'm very
55:24 - curious to just grab the number of units
55:26 - multiply it by 100 and see does it work
55:28 - with like a th000 a th000 uh units or
55:32 - not so I'm very very curious to see that
55:35 - why un do showing some errors I don't
55:38 - know that depends on what kind of Errors
55:39 - you're getting like over here I'm not
55:41 - getting any errors so everyone depends
55:43 - on what you're
55:46 - [Music]
55:48 - having can you check mxm package on the
55:51 - NT accessory and tell me is this
55:53 - possible without that package I'm not
55:55 - sure what mxm means so I don't know what
56:00 - is
56:02 - mxm motion matching is that what you
56:06 - mean if you're asking does unity support
56:09 - motion motion matching by default it
56:11 - doesn't uh so yeah if you're looking for
56:13 - that then there are a bunch of uh assets
56:15 - on the store that can be quite uh quite
56:18 - helpful for that top five books I much
56:21 - must read to improve my programming
56:22 - skills like the main one that I've
56:24 - recommend many many times many many
56:27 - times is code complete to I highly
56:30 - recommend this book it is really big
56:33 - really thick let me pick it
56:42 - up it's a super thick book but it
56:49 - does oh there you go so yeah super thick
56:52 - book about 800 pages
56:54 - long a lot of a lot of code a lot of
56:57 - text a lot of stuff so it does take
56:59 - quite a while to get through it but if
57:01 - you do get through it your skills as a
57:03 - programmer are going to improve 10 fold
57:05 - so yeah super thick definitely going to
57:07 - take you a while to get through but I
57:08 - highly highly recommend this book I
57:10 - definitely uh attribute to this book the
57:12 - most of the skills that I have in terms
57:15 - of specifically writing good clean code
57:17 - so yeah I high recommend if you want to
57:19 - improve your own programming skills
57:21 - definitely look into this book I can
57:23 - highly recommend it
57:27 - by the way I'm not sponsored I just love
57:29 - that book it has helped me a lot so I
57:31 - will definitely always uh point out that
57:34 - book because does help but are going to
57:37 - leave to GD later uh I would love to try
57:40 - out gdau at some point but leave not
57:43 - really I mean I've got my I don't know
57:46 - 12 years uh with unity at this point so
57:48 - that is quite a lot of uh experience
57:50 - gain I mean you always gain quite a lot
57:52 - of knowledge extra knowledge by sticking
57:54 - with one tool for a long time as opposed
57:56 - to jump just jumping back and forth so
57:59 - yeah I definitely would love to try out
58:00 - K do but no not going to not really
58:03 - going to switch uh thing code complete
58:07 - versus clean code are they both useful
58:08 - or is the just code complete is uh clean
58:11 - code is also good I also remember that I
58:13 - enjoyed not as much but uh I found that
58:16 - clean code was a bit uh a bit less in
58:20 - that a bit smaller so if you want
58:22 - something to read a bit faster then yeah
58:24 - I guess that one could be good cuz you
58:26 - can get through that one much quicker
58:28 - than you can get through this one so
58:30 - yeah both are really good uh on an
58:32 - infinite enough timeline I would
58:33 - definitely encourage you to read both of
58:35 - them but yeah if you can only pick one I
58:37 - would pick code complete but yeah clean
58:38 - code is also really good it's uh a bit
58:40 - smaller so you can get through it a
58:42 - little bit easier which can also can
58:44 - also help can also be
58:46 - nice uh is there a good beginner
58:48 - tutorial for Dots apparently many
58:50 - tutorials are out of date I would point
58:52 - you to my tutorial that I made like uh
58:54 - two months ago and is still very much up
58:57 - to date I mean I rewatched my own
58:58 - tutorial to to to get back into the
59:02 - mindset of dots to to focus on uh
59:05 - regaining the skills in order to be able
59:07 - to uh make this project so yep
59:09 - definitely go look at that video it's
59:11 - pretty long it's an hour and a half so
59:13 - it does cover quite a lot of things and
59:14 - Y pretty much all of it is still up to
59:16 - date so this one over here I was using
59:18 - version 1.0 whereas now there's version
59:20 - 1.2 there are a few different things but
59:23 - for the most part they're very much very
59:25 - much a same thing this code complete
59:28 - have a lot of fillers is it filled with
59:29 - fluff or does it jump in nope it just
59:32 - jumps in right away so there's really no
59:34 - fluff there's it's a very very technical
59:37 - book it is very much not a book to read
59:39 - for uh enjoyment I guess it is something
59:42 - to read just for Learning and yeah it
59:45 - definitely so yeah no filler just all
59:48 - excellent content excellent
59:53 - information all right so let me just try
59:55 - handling the uh the rotation cuz I
59:58 - actually don't know exactly how I can
60:02 - handle the rotation so I assume that
60:04 - it's going to be on the local
60:08 - transform yeah cuz over here I'm setting
60:10 - the rotation to the identity but
60:14 - quaternion are always
60:16 - tricky how do I get
60:20 - the is it LO
60:23 - rotation okay maybe with Lo rotation it
60:26 - might work take a forward and an
60:28 - up does flow three have it doesn't so I
60:32 - need to do a new flow three for the up
60:34 - so up will be 0 one 0 set the up and
60:38 - then the move there this will be the
60:41 - forward okay so let's see if just like
60:43 - this if it does work let's try it
60:47 - out prop theill link to Amazon I don't I
60:50 - don't have an aill link for Amazon sorry
60:52 - so yeah just go ahead and and pick it up
60:55 - uh it's definitely really awesome so
60:57 - yeah I think this is yeah this is
60:59 - amazon.com so yeah if you you want to
61:02 - pick it up I really highly encourage you
61:04 - it
61:04 - definitely keep in mind it's a thick
61:07 - thick book so like 800 pages so it takes
61:09 - a while but yeah definitely if you
61:11 - manage to go through it and you
61:13 - understand it it will definitely level
61:14 - up your skills 10x so yeah that is
61:17 - that's what happened to me so that is
61:19 - why I H recommend I read this book when
61:21 - I was in the is there an error sometimes
61:24 - dots has some strange errors but then it
61:26 - clicks uh oh boy there you go what
61:29 - happened
61:30 - okay assertion failed distance Force
61:33 - sword what the what in the
61:37 - world okay I have no
61:41 - idea okay so apparently I can't do
61:45 - this why can't I do a look rotation what
61:48 - does this okay let me try doing a debug.
61:51 - log on this one try to see what this one
61:54 - says over here qu that
61:56 - identity okay let's see what this one is
61:58 - going to
62:02 - say how to buy that book in India I
62:05 - don't know doesn't Amazon have an Indian
62:09 - P oh Nan why is it
62:12 - nan oh maybe it's zero is it
62:17 - zero
62:19 - uh why on Earth is the cuz I'm guessing
62:22 - look rotation actually has the rotation
62:26 - all debugging with debug on log yep
62:29 - debug on log doing all kinds of logs it
62:32 - is also really awesome okay so that's
62:33 - the oh right because they're uh static
62:37 - by default all right um okay so yeah I
62:40 - didn't know that I had to make a if okay
62:42 - so sure fine I guess
62:45 - so if oh yeah right and I also have to
62:48 - this is going to move quickly so then I
62:49 - have to do an alert but anyways so if
62:52 - move de equals float 3.0 if so then
62:55 - let's set this one into qu. identity
62:58 - okay and if not wait can't I do an
63:01 - equals on that if not then do that can't
63:05 - I do an equal on
63:07 - that a bone three what on Earth is a
63:10 - bone
63:12 - three okay that's the first time that
63:14 - I'm seeing this what on Earth is a b
63:19 - three oh does it compare all three of
63:23 - them well that's interesting and look at
63:26 - that I just learned something new
63:27 - apparently there is something called a
63:29 - bullion 3 which I'm guessing it is going
63:32 - to compare x with X and set that one to
63:34 - True y to Y set that one to true and oh
63:36 - that is
63:37 - interesting I mean it's it's not what I
63:40 - want but yeah that is interesting so how
63:43 - do
63:43 - I can't I get just a bullion out of
63:50 - this
63:54 - or no boy this is a giant
63:58 - class
64:00 - okay huh you have to compare with equals
64:03 - yeah I guess
64:05 - so I'm guessing there has to be a better
64:08 - way of doing that uh can I do this one.
64:12 - equals will this one yeah I guess this
64:15 - one will test that one be I had no idea
64:18 - there was such a thing as a bowling
64:20 - three so I'm guessing this one is going
64:21 - to yeah test the X Y and Z yeah look at
64:24 - that that is fun so there is such a
64:26 - thing as a bulling 3 who knew I wonder
64:28 - where that is useful I guess it just I
64:31 - guess if you want to do comparisons
64:33 - basically it's easier to compare all
64:35 - three values and set all three values as
64:37 - opposed to just one by oh anyways okay
64:40 - so so that is
64:42 - fun well our flat for equal yeah
64:44 - basically just testing each of them by
64:47 - themselves so yeah it must be very
64:48 - optimized for all kinds of things
64:50 - but okay look that it works and now the
64:54 - unit yeah I still need to still need to
64:56 - make
64:57 - the uh still need to do the one on that
65:00 - try math. all oh does that exist look at
65:02 - that yeah I still have to handle the
65:05 - stopping logic because they're basically
65:06 - just jumping back and forth between but
65:08 - yeah the logic works I go up here I
65:10 - click there and there you go he does
65:11 - rotate like that and does rotate on that
65:13 - side and on that side and that side nice
65:16 - all right that's cool that
65:19 - works see it's always awesome when
65:22 - something like that works so let's see
65:25 - the m ma.
65:27 - all okay so this one is going to do a
65:30 - bullion and yeah it's going to return
65:32 - that one and that one and so on and it's
65:34 - all massively in line so now I wonder
65:36 - which one is faster is it doing the
65:38 - equals getting the B three and then
65:40 - doing equals or just the equals I'm
65:42 - guessing this equal is going to be fast
65:43 - but yeah it's a there are so many so
65:45 - many math functions that I have no idea
65:47 - how how it works it's actually quite fun
65:50 - have two dogs what are the names so the
65:53 - brown one his name is Tik and her name
65:56 - is Tekk and they're both asleep right
65:59 - now I gotta get a a second camera would
66:02 - be nice to have like a dog camera
66:03 - because they're right over there so it
66:04 - would be nice to have a camera here
66:06 - pointing there would be fun so yeah I
66:08 - got to got to pick up a second camera
66:10 - because that would be would be fun okay
66:13 - all right so yeah so this is working but
66:15 - it has two problems so the first problem
66:16 - is that they get there and they don't
66:18 - stop and can I
66:21 - actually well I guess I can modify it
66:24 - over do I test here that's a good
66:27 - question I guess I can check if this one
66:31 - do magnitude oh it does not have a
66:34 - magnitude okay I thought it didn't does
66:36 - have a size nope huh so Flo three
66:40 - doesn't have magnitude doesn't have
66:43 - size nope just has a ton of XY oh I
66:46 - think it's on math I keep forgetting oh
66:48 - does it have length nope apparently not
66:52 - but yeah I do think that math. magnitude
66:55 - our size length Okay math does have
66:59 - length uh length of the move there so
67:03 - float reach Target distance let's say .5
67:08 - units that should be fine enough so if
67:10 - that one is to far if so then move
67:13 - closer and if not then do something but
67:16 - always put the angular velocity on zero
67:18 - because I don't want brilliant CH plugin
67:21 - yeah asking questions in Live Chat is
67:23 - actually uh super for uh useful okay so
67:28 - get the move Direction and if it gets if
67:30 - it is still too far then move closer if
67:32 - it is not then let me just set this one
67:34 - into no not here this one into a float
67:38 - 3.0 so basically it stops moving and
67:41 - stops rotating okay so actually I think
67:44 - like this it should stop and no longer
67:46 - do all of this uh crazy thing let's
67:49 - let's try it on and
67:53 - see you have TRS in six with baking uh
67:57 - not really I haven't had any issues
68:00 - so I don't know what uh problems here
68:03 - referring to but yeah it's um okay go
68:05 - there nice okay so now I just need to
68:07 - modify the the thing and it should and
68:10 - it should work but yeah I can select my
68:12 - units move around and they rotate
68:15 - correctly so just need to swap the
68:16 - animations but y they go on all over the
68:19 - place now just need to animate it and
68:22 - soon as they get there they no longer
68:23 - constantly jump back and forth they get
68:24 - there and stop oh math. up does that
68:27 - exist CU I tried looking at Flo 3. up
68:30 - and it did not exist math do up okay
68:34 - there you go it does work oh this is a
68:36 - function that's a bit confusing I got to
68:38 - say one thing that I dislike is how the
68:40 - math Library over here this one does not
68:43 - follow the normal rules like why is the
68:45 - class name lowercase why is this one
68:47 - lowercase but apparently it's a function
68:49 - so that is one thing that drives me
68:51 - crazy but from what I understood I
68:53 - believe they did it because all of the
68:54 - other uh ECS based math libraries of
68:57 - those super fast math libraries they
68:58 - were based on they basally use this uh
69:01 - naming rules but so I can understand why
69:04 - they chose it but I still dis like it
69:05 - still looks very strange but anyways so
69:08 - yeah I'm guessing this one does return
69:10 - um a crap and I also I still haven't
69:12 - figured out why it is that sometimes
69:14 - Vision Studio opens up everything in
69:16 - Gray and doesn't seem to recognize
69:18 - anything and sometimes does work anyways
69:21 - but yep it does do exactly that return
69:22 - new floats 0
69:24 - one0 all right
69:28 - nice looks like Doom worthy character uh
69:33 - didn't have an idol an mission was using
69:34 - walking said oh is that is that the case
69:37 - do Doom characters not have Idol I guess
69:40 - they're always patrolling around so
69:42 - that's nice I didn't I didn't uh never
69:45 - thought about that but yeah I guess they
69:47 - they move constantly so yeah Library
69:50 - written on Java rules yeah I'm not sure
69:52 - where the rules Come From but yeah it is
69:55 - basically I read once that they made it
69:57 - so that it fits with other other
70:01 - libraries that already exist and where
70:02 - super high performance andely fit that
70:04 - naming scheme as opposed to continuing
70:06 - to use the unity naming scheme so that
70:08 - is a bit
70:10 - strange uh do you know you can iterate
70:12 - faster if you install the hot reload
70:14 - asset I have heard of that asset and
70:16 - does look really awesome but I haven't
70:18 - yet uh haven't yet seen it so haven't
70:20 - yet used it myself but but yeah it does
70:23 - it does uh from what I saw on the assur
70:25 - page it does work quite well although
70:28 - especially with dots like I click and
70:30 - basically just starts right away and
70:31 - when I modify something it recompiles in
70:33 - one or two seconds so don't really
70:36 - necessarily need that much uh much
70:41 - faster have you gotten into making
70:43 - editor tools I did make a few I mean
70:46 - when I made the uh the uh the companion
70:50 - project for my C course for that one I
70:53 - made an entire editor tool so yeah
70:55 - thanks so much the qua yeah a bunch of
70:57 - new members on this live stream that was
70:58 - fun uh so I made the um the editor TOS
71:03 - for the cop course yep I use the uh UI
71:05 - toolkit to make a bunch of editor tools
71:07 - and it actually did work quite well so
71:09 - it worked surprisingly well so that was
71:11 - uh quite
71:13 - fun so uh thanks for your free course
71:17 - nice I'm beginning the intermediate
71:18 - tutorial and I'm loving it oh that is
71:20 - awesome that is cool I hope you I hope
71:21 - you learn a lot from it oh or was it
71:26 - how to give audio in unity dots that is
71:28 - a good question I haven't yet researched
71:30 - that so so yeah I'm curious to see that
71:34 - myself because yep I haven't yet
71:37 - researched it so I'm not entirely sure
71:39 - and actually let me just quickly add the
71:41 - animations and adding the animations
71:43 - should be rather simple I just need a
71:46 - ref RW what did I call it the animation
71:48 - test okay I still need to still need to
71:51 - refactor the name on that one but
71:53 - basically I just need the anime test I
71:55 - just need to get that one and
71:58 - basically uh too far so I want to move
72:03 - closer so if I'm on this one then I go
72:05 - into that one Val RW animation type and
72:09 - let me put Marine walk which of course
72:11 - then I'm going to have to refactor that
72:13 - so uh close enough stop
72:17 - moving so on this one let's go into
72:19 - Marine idle okay and just like this it
72:22 - should actually be should actually be
72:24 - working
72:30 - sou Brazil hey thanks for being here
72:33 - what time is it in Brazil it's like
72:35 - minus 8 hours I guess so it's like 10:
72:38 - a.m. there right now nice um one thing I
72:42 - disliked about ECS workflow is that it's
72:44 - slower compared to op and components you
72:47 - have to write to many logic do the same
72:49 - things but performance is unmatched of
72:51 - course yep I definitely do find it that
72:53 - it has quite a bit more plate code quite
72:56 - a few more things okay I just broke
72:58 - something out oh right cuz I put it on
73:00 - the other one so I got to I got to fix
73:02 - the query um so yeah I do find that it
73:04 - has quite a bit more uh quite a bit more
73:08 - uh boiler plate so it does take quite a
73:11 - lot more code so yeah that is why the uh
73:14 - recommended uh thing the recommended
73:16 - process is a hybrid workflow so
73:18 - basically use game objects for the
73:19 - things where a game object makes sense
73:21 - and use ODS for the things when you need
73:22 - absolute massive performance so yeah
73:25 - it's uh it's basically a very good thing
73:28 - that Unity kind of walked back on their
73:31 - initial goal which was make uh either
73:34 - full game object or full dots it's nice
73:36 - that over time they realize that the
73:38 - best uh workflow of all is just makes
73:40 - them use one or the other depending on
73:42 - when it is uh necessary so yeah that
73:45 - actually is quite
73:49 - nice uh yeah I was talking about two
73:52 - where's my oh there it is
73:55 - Yeah so basically for the all of the
73:56 - various things that I did for the for my
73:59 - for the companion project on my C course
74:00 - for all of this for the election list
74:03 - all the things for all the uh exercises
74:05 - the quizzes and so on so let me select
74:07 - one like for example select the one on
74:09 - variables going on the fq so all of
74:11 - these editor Windows these are basically
74:13 - custom tools Custom Custom editor
74:17 - Windows
74:19 - uh uh so yeah I basically built all of
74:22 - this so how can you modify the value of
74:24 - a variable by assigning a new value by
74:26 - using the modify keyword or by Red
74:28 - declaring and the answer is by assigning
74:30 - a new value to the variable and so on so
74:32 - basically all this was made using UI
74:34 - tokit actually if you have the companion
74:36 - project and you want to inspect if you
74:38 - want you can go over here inside of this
74:40 - folder then you can go inside the editor
74:42 - folder and over here you can see the
74:44 - various UI toet like for example let's
74:46 - say the one on the frequently asked
74:47 - questions because this one is nice and
74:49 - simple just double click and up pops out
74:51 - the UI Builder so here it is basically
74:54 - how the home thing works in the UI
74:55 - Builder so this is the same thing as
74:57 - this one over here so the UI Builder if
74:59 - you haven't used it yet for making
75:01 - editor tools it is surprisingly easy it
75:03 - only took me a I don't know a couple of
75:05 - hours watching some tutorial videos in
75:07 - order to figure out how to make it work
75:08 - but yeah UI Builder is actually
75:10 - surprisingly easy to work and then
75:12 - writing the code to run all these things
75:15 - um it is also surprisingly easy it does
75:19 - have one thing that I dislike which is
75:20 - how uh it's based on strings so like for
75:24 - example here I am creating the window
75:26 - okay sure then creating the [ __ ] and
75:28 - basically just got to do a bunch of
75:30 - queries so you can query on all kinds of
75:33 - types like an object field visual
75:34 - element and so on but then here's the
75:36 - part that I dislike about UI to Kit is
75:38 - how it has strings for doing queries so
75:40 - that is a little bit annoying but other
75:42 - than that UI toolkit is really awesome
75:44 - and surprisingly easy for making all
75:46 - kinds of uh editor tools so so yeah that
75:50 - is what I what I've used and it's
75:52 - actually quite nice and just recently I
75:54 - actually uh added this little window
75:56 - chat with AI so basically this one is
75:58 - connected to the uh bot that is trained
76:01 - on the contents of the course so you can
76:02 - basically uh chat with something and
76:05 - this one is actually on the back end the
76:07 - the AI chat bot is using open AI so I
76:10 - recently upgraded it to the uh new
76:12 - version so GPT 40 it's actually quite
76:14 - fun so if I ask what is the difference
76:18 - between delegates and events which is
76:21 - actually a question that a lot of people
76:23 - have asked me many times a lot of people
76:24 - have
76:25 - this confusion between where Del gets
76:28 - and the
76:30 - vents I can basically ask the question
76:33 - and then after a while it Returns the
76:36 - question and this one I'm guessing it's
76:38 - writing a ton of stuff that is why
76:40 - it's they use open AI library to make
76:43 - the bot uh not really I'm not sure if
76:45 - they have a C library so no I just use
76:49 - uh normal uh basically this goes onto my
76:52 - website and my website does a uh a
76:54 - current request on the open AI thing and
76:57 - then returns back and returns so on so
76:59 - basically this one this window over here
77:01 - is interacting with my website my
77:02 - website is interacting with the open Ai
77:04 - and then so on it goes kind of like that
77:07 - so yeah difference between them so
77:09 - delegat definition delegate is the type
77:11 - that defines a method signature y that
77:13 - is correct so here is an example public
77:15 - delegate attack delegate yep that is
77:18 - exactly correct and then for events does
77:20 - all kinds of things so yeah so yeah the
77:22 - bot on uh GPT 40 is actually
77:25 - surprisingly uh surprisingly good and
77:28 - quite fast so that is actually uh quite
77:30 - nice see Youtubers with chat walking on
77:33 - screen how do you achieve this effect I
77:35 - have a bunch of tutorials on the bottom
77:37 - of this page if you want to see so go on
77:40 - to that page down here so basically the
77:41 - characters down here this is a
77:42 - transparent Unity window the way they
77:44 - are being animated these are mesh based
77:46 - animations and then the way that it is
77:48 - interacting with the YouTube API is
77:50 - through an HTTP request from unity and
77:52 - the randomization on all these
77:54 - characters is basic the same way that I
77:55 - handle the get spreadsheets in my game
77:57 - battle R kind of like
78:00 - that this response would take like one
78:02 - second on llama
78:03 - 3 uh I guess that is going to are you
78:07 - talking about on device because that is
78:09 - going to depend on the device of the
78:11 - person and on this one the main thing
78:14 - that it uh the main thing that over here
78:18 - on the on the uh on this window that
78:20 - takes a while is because basically uh I
78:23 - didn't Implement uh streaming so
78:25 - basically it just waits for the entire
78:26 - response to be generated before it does
78:28 - so when it's a long uh when it's a long
78:32 - uh response like this one then yeah does
78:34 - take a few seconds but if it is
78:35 - something short then yeah it takes like
78:37 - one two seconds and it actually goes
78:39 - quite well and uh
78:43 - yeah
78:46 - uh oh uh does that mean we have to input
78:49 - our own API token nope this one is using
78:51 - my my website API token and and no it's
78:55 - not really rate limited I mean I'm
78:59 - assuming that the people who pick up the
79:01 - C course they're actively trying to
79:03 - learn as opposed to trying to abuse the
79:06 - system so maybe maybe I'm a bit naive
79:08 - but so far there haven't been problems
79:09 - with that so if you have the uh the
79:13 - premium version of the course go ahead
79:14 - ask whatever questions you want and yeah
79:17 - it shouldn't be R limited
79:20 - hopefully um okay let me just uh try to
79:23 - sort this out which is actually going to
79:25 - be an interesting
79:26 - question uh like I was saying sometimes
79:28 - when it comes to dots you've got to
79:30 - think about various things that you can
79:32 - do so basically the issue over here is
79:33 - that query is no longer working so I can
79:35 - no longer move
79:37 - and and uh it's not this one no this is
79:40 - the other one uh and basically the issue
79:43 - is because I added the anime test but
79:45 - hey good evening hey uh basically the
79:48 - issue is that I added that one to the
79:49 - query but for the visual I added it to a
79:52 - child object ah so now here's another
79:55 - question how do I reference this in
79:58 - terms of handling references that is
80:01 - something that I still haven't yet
80:02 - figured out the best way to do it I
80:05 - think the best way is really this one
80:07 - has
80:08 - a unit authoring but this one has but
80:11 - all the other ones are actually going to
80:13 - have animation
80:14 - right well I guess I could make
80:19 - a I guess I could make a yeah I guess
80:22 - that's what makes sense so okay so let's
80:25 - go let's make an animated mesh
80:28 - authoring so I Mak an animated mesh
80:31 - authoring components okay and then I'm
80:34 - going to have a public uh animated mesh
80:37 - a class not a Class A struct and this
80:39 - one is going to be I component data okay
80:43 - and now on this one I'm going to have a
80:44 - public entity for animated mesh entity
80:47 - and that is the one that is going to
80:49 - have that component for that thing so
80:51 - over here a public game object for
80:53 - animated mesh game object all right and
80:57 - then I've got a public class I'm going
80:59 - to have a class A Baker class Baker of
81:03 - animated mesh authoring okay and then on
81:07 - this
81:08 - one so I'm basically going to entity
81:11 - equals get this entity and this one is
81:14 - going to be transform. dynamic okay and
81:18 - then I need to add the component and
81:20 - adding the component on this entity new
81:23 - animated mesh and inside that animated
81:26 - mesh inside for the animated mesh entity
81:29 - get the entity and the entity that I
81:32 - want is the authoring do animated mesh
81:34 - game object and it's going to be
81:37 - dynamic okay so y like this so basically
81:40 - I have this one this one has a reference
81:41 - to the other one so now if I attach this
81:44 - component to that one it should
81:46 - hopefully work you prefer Visual Studio
81:48 - over wrer uh not necess pref uh uh any
81:51 - preference just it's what a misu it's
81:54 - what I've used and I don't really have
81:56 - any uh any kind of thing against it and
81:59 - it made mes That's What I Call uh so
82:02 - yeah basically have no reason to switch
82:04 - but from what I've heard uh ryer is
82:06 - indeed awesome so yeah if you like using
82:09 - that then definitely go ahead and use
82:11 - that okay so that one has a reference to
82:13 - that one so now over here on the unit
82:15 - mover system instead of looking for that
82:17 - component I can look for this component
82:19 - for the animated mesh so this one
82:22 - animated mesh
82:26 - but now yep that's the thing so now I
82:28 - need to go system API to get the
82:31 - component of type animated uh animate
82:35 - test I still have to refactor that code
82:38 - to rename it get that one on the entity
82:41 - that is the entity on animated mesh
82:42 - value R yeah I'm not going to modify
82:45 - this one so let's make this one a ref r
82:47 - o r
82:50 - o
82:53 - ref so I inside that one and I get the
82:56 - animate mesh entity okay so this Returns
82:58 - the animate
83:00 - test wait does this okay now I'm trying
83:04 - to see because there is another yeah
83:05 - there is a get component RW so what does
83:08 - this return does yep so returns a ref RW
83:11 - animate test animate test okay awesome
83:15 - so now I go into that one and I do that
83:16 - let me actually put this one up there so
83:19 - I go into that one I do that and then I
83:21 - go into that one I do that all right
83:24 - nice so this should hopefully be working
83:27 - so let's see let's see if it
83:31 - works
83:34 - uh let's see okay they are idle and they
83:38 - are moving nice okay so all that All
83:41 - That Remains is having different uh
83:43 - animation speeds so like the walking
83:45 - that one needs to be like a fast
83:48 - animation but the idle is not meant to
83:49 - be that fast but y so I tell them to
83:51 - move they run and they get there oh
83:55 - those
83:55 - are five because they are still oh
83:59 - because they are still pushing each
84:00 - other so I still have to uh reorganize
84:02 - that code to make it work in a different
84:04 - way so that they get to a point oh look
84:06 - at that need shooting not shooting for
84:08 - the weapon so I still need to figure
84:10 - that out but
84:12 - yeah uh remember tool is as limiting as
84:15 - your knowledge yep definitely IDs are
84:17 - just tools uh rer is an awesome ID from
84:21 - what I've heard but just using an
84:23 - awesome ID isn't necess going to make
84:24 - you better it's really just a tool so
84:26 - whatever you use WR Visual Studio Visual
84:29 - Studio code whatever you do it
84:32 - uh what matters is really your own
84:35 - skills so yeah you're a student you can
84:37 - get all jet brings products for free oh
84:39 - is that true that is nice that is
84:40 - awesome I did not know that that is cool
84:43 - I mean I'm using the
84:45 - um the uh uh uh yeah Visual Studio has
84:50 - the community version that is always
84:52 - free so that is the one
84:55 - that I
84:57 - normally encourage people to use so
84:59 - visual City Community is free but yeah
85:01 - wrer
85:07 - ID that as a free day Tri and yeah on
85:11 - education I'm guessing they have real
85:14 - licenses for students and teachers so
85:16 - yeah that is nice for individual use and
85:18 - so on so yeah I mean like I said I've
85:20 - Heard lots of great things about it so
85:23 - yeah if you are if you want to try out a
85:25 - different ID then definitely give r a
85:27 - try and see see if you'll like it all
85:30 - right so yeah so logic is indeed working
85:32 - so I've got some dots entities they are
85:34 - animated they are walking around it's
85:37 - kind of funny how as soon as you add
85:39 - some uh some entities all of a sudden it
85:41 - looks quite a lot better so that's nice
85:46 - uh yeah the units are moving a bit too
85:48 - slow but yeah let's attack that one boom
85:51 - boom nice oh I got to move move the the
85:55 - health bar a little bit up and why is
85:57 - that one not looking at the camera it
85:59 - should
86:01 - be oh CU I
86:03 - didn't oh that is going to be a tricky
86:08 - thing okay I'm going to have to figure
86:11 - that one out cuz yeah the health bar is
86:13 - looking at the camera but due to how
86:17 - dots works it does not handle the global
86:20 - rotation only the local one so that is
86:23 - why when it moves to the side the health
86:25 - bar is no long oh okay so I'm going to
86:27 - have to have to figure that
86:31 - out oh Jason Sorry's here oh is he oh
86:34 - hey Jason hey how's it going can I go
86:36 - back since I started using it too many
86:38 - quality of life features yep yep that's
86:41 - exactly what I've heard from from
86:43 - yourself and many others from the from
86:46 - the uh Game Dev show many people talking
86:49 - about the benefits of of rers so yeah
86:52 - yeah I heard you were talking about a
86:55 - uh working on a new video so looking
86:57 - forward to it yeah a launer that it
86:59 - sound interesting when you talked about
87:00 - on the game da show so yeah I'm looking
87:02 - forward to uh the new
87:10 - video little launcher yeah the way that
87:13 - Jason mentioned in the the live stream
87:16 - how basically you have a bunch of
87:17 - hotkeys so you don't have any icons any
87:19 - kind of thing I got to say that does in
87:22 - theory it does appeal to me cuz my my
87:24 - desktop does get full with tons of tons
87:26 - of uh icons even though I try to make it
87:29 - as uh simple as possible after a while
87:31 - it just ends up with tons of mess so
87:33 - yeah uh learning how to use something
87:35 - with just shortcut just things that
87:36 - actually sounds really
87:39 - awesome how is Tikko doing well both of
87:42 - them are asleep right now although they
87:44 - will probably wake up in a little bit
87:45 - because it's already 600 p.m. so in a
87:48 - little bit they will wake up and will be
87:50 - hungry so yeah just a little bit more uh
87:54 - where was
87:58 - I uh I was also doing some work on an
88:01 - idea for grids in unity video rewatch
88:03 - your older grid videos for inspiration
88:05 - that's nice awesome yeah I got to say
88:07 - grid system is something that is always
88:09 - always useful I've used grid systems in
88:12 - so many things and it's a something that
88:14 - is also although there is one thing
88:16 - about the it's not the grid system it's
88:18 - the mouse position something that you
88:20 - mentioned on one of the live streams on
88:21 - how you can apparently use the plane
88:23 - class cuz like for my mouse script I'm
88:25 - using a ray cast in order to find the
88:27 - position and I think you mentioned how
88:29 - you can use the uh Unity plane thing in
88:33 - order to get the intersection I heard
88:35 - you mention it but I'm not entirely sure
88:37 - on how it is how do you get
88:40 - the I guess that's it I guess you do a
88:43 - rast on a
88:45 - plane out float enter so it's not the oh
88:48 - it's a distance okay so I guess you take
88:50 - a ray cast from the camera's position
88:52 - you do a rast this return the distance
88:54 - and then you go inside
88:56 - the uh isn't there a get position get
89:00 - distance to
89:01 - point or no get side when do you get
89:07 - the is it
89:10 - translate okay now I'm not sure because
89:13 - I assumed they would have a get position
89:15 - some kind of thing
89:19 - but to cover the rare topics like
89:21 - compressing a large sparse grid when
89:24 - run left encoding using TRS matrixes to
89:27 - do recasting checks against without
89:29 - needing colliders wow that sounds like a
89:32 - very complex thing yeah uh you don't
89:35 - even need the pl class I use that as an
89:37 - example yeah I guess you can just use uh
89:40 - some math in order to figure out I mean
89:41 - you've got a ray you want to see if it
89:43 - hits there where exactly does it hit
89:45 - then yeah I guess you you can just use
89:47 - some basic math and it oh crap why is my
89:50 - phone suspected spam well that's not
89:53 - nice anyway anyways um uh so
89:59 - yeah ray. get Point okay that's what I
90:02 - was looking for yeah so the ray Returns
90:04 - the Ray has a uh yeah exactly it has a
90:08 - get point where you pass in distance and
90:09 - returns this and that so yeah so yeah I
90:11 - guess instead of doing rast you can just
90:13 - do a plane in order to that so it should
90:16 - be fun till now do you think I can use
90:19 - nt6 preview based on your experience in
90:21 - using it and I want to work on Android
90:22 - with it because it has a lot of improve
90:23 - improvements for Android it all depends
90:25 - on how far long you are from the release
90:27 - if your game is coming out in like one
90:30 - or two months then use the 22 LTS oh
90:33 - that one now no longer works because it
90:34 - doesn't have the mesh um so if your game
90:37 - is coming out very soon then stick with
90:39 - the 22 LTS but if you are at least like
90:41 - six months away from release then
90:43 - definitely yeah go ahead and upgrade to
90:45 - Unity 6 because I mean at least from my
90:47 - research right now it has been very
90:49 - stable it hasn't crashed once it hasn't
90:50 - had any issues so it has actually worked
90:53 - uh quite
90:56 - well uh I just got to know your channel
91:00 - oh nice want to know if you have a
91:01 - tutorial about design patterns in
91:04 - unity uh not necessarily although I do
91:07 - have a a lecture on it in my uh
91:11 - C course I don't remember if it's on the
91:14 - I think it's on the intermediate one on
91:17 - the why isn't this
91:20 - fing see now YouTube search is so
91:22 - strange okay okay so if I put C enter it
91:26 - doesn't show up C intermediate it does
91:28 - show up okay anyways so yeah sometimes
91:32 - YouTube search is very strange but
91:34 - anyways
91:35 - yeah so here I have a rough uh thing
91:38 - where I talk about some design patterns
91:40 - in general and one on the Singleton
91:42 - patterns so I guess uh let me skip this
91:46 - ah crap the ads I'm used to having a
91:49 - premium when I'm logged in but over here
91:50 - I'm not logged in so yeah uh
91:56 - so if you want to learn then hopefully
91:58 - this lecture should help uh point you in
92:00 - the right
92:02 - direction okay so let me just uh okay
92:05 - let me just oh there are some units that
92:08 - are yeah this something that I still
92:10 - have to figure out look at that uh that
92:13 - is the issue is that when they go
92:15 - idle they're all constantly still trying
92:18 - to go to the same point so I got to uh
92:20 - add some stopping logic so that they
92:22 - stop moving otherwise they move on top
92:25 - of one another see if I try putting all
92:27 - of them oh yeah I can disable this one
92:29 - because I no longer needed they all go
92:30 - they all go into one
92:32 - place and it all gets messed up they get
92:34 - on top of each other because they're all
92:36 - trying to go to the same point so it's
92:38 - all it's all messed up yeah they're
92:40 - definitely fighting each other quite a
92:43 - bit
92:49 - uh oh speaking of course just want to
92:51 - say I 100% recommend Cod M SC oh thanks
92:53 - Jason that's nice all on I can so I know
92:56 - what to recommend I think you me G
92:57 - course is by far my favorite unit oh
92:59 - nice yeah thank you
93:11 - um uh okay let me just apply the uh
93:14 - visual to that gu right there and get
93:16 - rid of this one because I longer need uh
93:18 - this one over here now this animate test
93:22 - so the test was successful so
93:24 - just okay so let me remember what do I
93:26 - need in order to make it work yeah I
93:28 - should probably use some uh base prefabs
93:30 - instead of trying to do it like this but
93:32 - for now let's put it like this so let's
93:33 - go inside the unit prefab and inside
93:36 - this one let's paste that one which okay
93:39 - paste on the wrong place but okay and
93:42 - this one is actually going oh right
93:45 - because I wanted
93:47 - to yeah this is the thing that I'm going
93:49 - to have to figure out how am I going to
93:53 - change
93:58 - this okay now I'm trying to trying to
94:00 - remember where did I yeah cuz that is
94:02 - not
94:04 - the was that no that wasn't
94:07 - the okay I'm trying to trying to
94:11 - think uh CU I've got this an I'm trying
94:15 - to think what is the how do I find the
94:17 - material that I
94:19 - was using that one is white nope it's
94:22 - not that one it's not that one
94:25 - oh well I mean I guess I have one of the
94:28 - various ones down here no that's not the
94:32 - Scout is that the Scout nope that's not
94:34 - the Scout is that the Scout that is the
94:37 - Scout okay so what is the material that
94:39 - I was using on this
94:41 - one material uh this one special forces
94:45 - okay good let me just copy that one and
94:48 - then go inside the unit fast and on this
94:50 - one let me put that material and okay
94:54 - now it looks good all right great so but
94:57 - yeah I'm definitely going to have to uh
95:00 - rework how am I going to have this
95:03 - animated mesh CU I think like this it is
95:05 - going to
95:06 - be quite tricky but if I open this one
95:09 - and I paste this one like
95:13 - that uh the animated mesh just pass in
95:15 - that reference and just like this this
95:17 - one should be working although it won't
95:19 - be
95:20 - working like that
95:25 - huh so this is the part that I'm going
95:26 - to have to stop and think long and hard
95:29 - for a long time until I figure out what
95:31 - is the best course of action for this
95:34 - let me just hide
95:35 - these that one and that
95:38 - one there's some one more this one oh
95:42 - crap cuz I can't see it behind the
95:44 - characters
95:46 - uh why is there there are two characters
95:50 - why are there two characters here
95:57 - okay why is
95:59 - this okay I'm not sure where this
96:02 - character is coming
96:04 - from CU sometimes if you create an
96:06 - entity that only exists as an entity it
96:08 - doesn't select anything on the hierarchy
96:10 - so if I click on that one it doesn't
96:11 - select anything here so is that an let
96:13 - me unload and reload okay it vanished so
96:15 - it was a zombie entity that stayed
96:18 - behind and did something okay anyways so
96:21 - yeah so that one should be working but
96:23 - yeah ex it's going to be using S down
96:26 - which is a different
96:28 - mesh so
96:30 - [Music]
96:33 - H yeah ghost object very spooky oh hey
96:36 - Phil it's you oh hey how's it going
96:42 - uh right so basically is this the best
96:44 - course of action basically just having a
96:47 - component and that component contains
96:50 - all the references to all the meshes and
96:52 - all the animations on the one hand I
96:54 - don't like it but on the other hand I
96:57 - can't think of a better way to do it
96:58 - because again on on dots you don't
97:01 - really have lists of things
97:05 - so and I don't think using a dynamic
97:08 - buffer would be
97:10 - best I mean technically a bch mesh ID
97:13 - this one is really tiny so I don't think
97:15 - it would be an issue if I've got like
97:17 - 100 of these it's literally just a u in
97:20 - value So in theory it would not
97:23 - necessarily be a terrible thing if I had
97:26 - 100 of these although I
97:32 - guess one thing that I haven't yet uh is
97:35 - the shared components I haven't seen
97:37 - those in quite a
97:38 - [Music]
97:39 - while shared components so maybe that's
97:43 - it maybe I do a would this be the case
97:46 - for blob B data can a blob asset data
97:49 - have I haven't looked into blob assets
97:52 - much yet so I'm not entirely
97:57 - sure but
98:02 - a so a blob asset creates
98:08 - a so basically you can create a blob
98:11 - bass and then have a reference to that
98:12 - blob B but I think that would kind of
98:14 - end up being the same thing although
98:16 - maybe a little bit more
98:24 - that is part of why I'm squirly on dots
98:26 - friction is a productivity C and I don't
98:28 - want have to derail every time I have to
98:30 - learn how to solve existing problems yep
98:32 - that is I mean that is definitely an
98:34 - issue with trying something that is very
98:36 - new which is yeah if I was making an an
98:39 - uh if I was making an RTS game using
98:41 - normal game objects then yeah I would be
98:43 - I would be done with this prototype by
98:44 - now having to learn how to do many
98:46 - things new it does had quite a lot of
98:49 - friction quite a lot of things but at
98:50 - the same time the benefits are
98:52 - supposedly really awesome so I'm I'm
98:53 - hoping that when uh this game is done
98:56 - and working I'm hoping that it won't
98:59 - because it's based on dots it won't
99:01 - allow me to make different designs as
99:03 - opposed to what I could do just based on
99:04 - game object so it is it adds quite a bit
99:08 - more friction quite a bit more uh takes
99:10 - quite a while to build because I have to
99:12 - relearn how to do things but hopefully
99:14 - the bonuses at the end will be uh quite
99:17 - useful so
99:19 - yeah what use queries instead of empti
99:21 - jobs just because I'm still making the
99:23 - prototype so I haven't converted
99:25 - anything into jobs yet so everything is
99:27 - still just normal uh in queries but yep
99:30 - uh eventually when the when everything
99:32 - is working exactly as I wanted to then
99:34 - yep then I will go refactor all these
99:36 - systems in order to make them work with
99:38 - systems in order to in order to make
99:39 - them work with jobs to make them as
99:42 - performant as I can make them
99:45 - so uh but yeah so
99:47 - essentially uh yeah this one well let me
99:50 - just let me just do it manually right
99:52 - now and then I'll re Factor the code
99:54 - once I figure out a better way to do it
99:56 - but let me just try doing a so Scout
100:00 - Idol and W also has the same thing so
100:02 - let me do a scout idle zero and one and
100:06 - Scout walk 0 1 2 3 one two and three
100:12 - then up here same thing so a scout itle
100:16 - zero and one
100:17 - Scout W 0 1 2
100:21 - 3 so with with that it won't work but
100:26 - the uh let me make a bunch of them so
100:31 - basically going to have
100:33 - the idle zero ID
100:36 - one
100:37 - [Music]
100:39 - one to wait did I miss one uh yeah I'm
100:43 - missing the zero the W zero
100:47 - okay so I really dislike the fact that
100:49 - it has a huge amount of stuff but
100:51 - technically it might work cooking
100:54 - fitness channel when that would be fun I
100:56 - mean if I had infinite amount of time I
100:58 - would love to do a bunch more channels
101:01 - to have basically excuses to do all
101:03 - kinds of all kinds of interesting
101:05 - hobbies that would definitely be
101:07 - fun are you finding it so far it's been
101:10 - nice I'm CAU up with the series does
101:12 - give you insight to more lower level
101:14 - stuff I know learning completion made me
101:16 - understand Val types more uh it has I
101:19 - mean the main challenge has been
101:21 - figuring out what parts should be dots
101:22 - and what part should be normal game
101:24 - objects like in the beginning for the uh
101:26 - for the first iteration that I was using
101:29 - for handling the 11 selection I was
101:31 - using a DOT system and I was finding
101:33 - that was needlessly complex having to
101:35 - work with uh because I was also doing
101:37 - the ray cast in order to find the M
101:38 - position so I was having to mix the dots
101:41 - with the uh with the mono Behavior world
101:43 - and so on so that was being confusing
101:44 - until I simply made it a I don't know a
101:47 - rough rule a rough guideline okay things
101:49 - that involve tons of units like for
101:50 - example each individual unit for the
101:52 - moving shooting and so on okay that
101:54 - makes sense to be dot spased but for
101:55 - other things like the selection I mean
101:57 - the selection is only I'm only going to
101:58 - select units like once per second so it
102:00 - makes no sense for that one to be a dots
102:02 - thing so in the beginning I made a unit
102:05 - selection thing but then I just made a
102:07 - regular mono Behavior to handle the
102:09 - things so yeah that was the main thing
102:11 - that I've learned as I'm making this
102:14 - prototype is trying to get a better idea
102:16 - of what should be dots based what should
102:18 - be game objects based uh cuz yeah that
102:20 - is the that seems like the main
102:23 - main question for trying to build a
102:25 - project the correct way using a nice
102:27 - haard approach and yeah I've tried
102:29 - looking for Best Practices but yeah
102:31 - there's
102:32 - still not much around so yeah basically
102:34 - I'm going in blind trying to do all
102:36 - kinds of things trying to figure out
102:38 - what is the best way to do them and uh
102:41 - and yeah so it's been a nice Learning
102:42 - Journey but other than that by following
102:45 - that guideline things have been uh going
102:48 - quite well so I'm quite enjoying it it's
102:50 - been quite fun okay let me just that's
102:53 - the Scout idle zero Scout idle one then
102:56 - the walk zero the walk one the walk two
103:00 - and the walk Three then I'm going to
103:01 - need the different uh over here so got
103:06 - Marine walk got the Scout idle and the
103:09 - Scout
103:10 - wonk but now this is going to be the big
103:13 - issue
103:15 - right yep that is going to be the big
103:19 - issue CU I need an animation type and an
103:22 - animation divis idual so this is why
103:24 - it's going to
103:25 - be or not
103:29 - okay okay so I think I just figured out
103:32 - how I might make this work
103:34 - so so this one is actually the same so
103:37 - the Scout I also has two frames and
103:39 - Scout walk also has four
103:41 - frames uh okay but yeah all of this has
103:45 - to be different so this is the part that
103:47 - is definitely quite annoying quite
103:49 - tricky a lot of copy paste code so I
103:51 - really got to figure out a better way to
103:52 - do this
103:54 - but uh so the Scout idle zero the Scout
103:57 - idle one and then I've got the Scout
104:01 - walk zero walk one walk two and walk
104:05 - Three ah Scout walk three and Scout W
104:11 - to okay so that one it should be working
104:14 - but now I need to figure out when it's
104:16 - say Scout and when it is not a scout and
104:18 - I think that I already have that on the
104:21 - unit so so if I go on the uh where do I
104:26 - want to go on the unit
104:29 - mover yeah because I'm pretty sure the
104:31 - enemies also have the units so if I do a
104:33 - ref R of type unit I'm pretty sure on
104:37 - that one so ref R of type unit for the
104:40 - unit and if I grab that unit I'm pretty
104:43 - sure inside of
104:45 - it valo I do have a unit type okay nice
104:49 - so let me get an animate test. animation
104:53 - type uh idle animation
104:57 - type and got another one for the won
105:00 - animation type then I do a switch on
105:02 - this unit type that I have and by doing
105:07 - that uh Supply right now I've got
105:11 - soldiers and I've got the other one the
105:14 - other one is the fast okay so the first
105:19 - the idle
105:20 - equals uh that one. the scout
105:23 - Idol and the Scout W so that's the W and
105:28 - for this one for the idol equals this
105:30 - one the Marine idle and the Marine W and
105:34 - this is the W animation type okay so now
105:37 - over here instead of setting down one I
105:39 - set it to that one and instead of
105:42 - setting down one I set it to that one
105:44 - just need to make sure to add a default
105:45 - to make it work and
105:48 - okay all right so I think like this it
105:51 - should be work I'm L what problem you're
105:54 - solving I'm trying to solve the problem
105:56 - of having the
105:57 - animations be different for each unit
106:00 - type so right now that one was all was
106:02 - playing the same animation with
106:03 - different material but now I want them
106:05 - to play different animations so that one
106:07 - should play the Scout and this one
106:09 - should play the marine and right now it
106:10 - should be working no it's not okay why
106:14 - did that one vanish Into Thin Air I
106:16 - don't
106:16 - know uh where did that unit
106:21 - go okay
106:29 - uh okay let me go inside why did that
106:32 - one
106:34 - vanish cuz it is
106:37 - changing did I not
106:41 - register oh why are they all I'm pretty
106:44 - sure you're not supposed to be all at
106:46 - zero pretty sure that means invalid so
106:50 - did the baker not run
106:55 - No it should have
107:02 - run okay now I'm trying to figure out
107:05 - why is this one
107:08 - not cuz that one is not registering the
107:10 - meshes did I not add the meshes I did
107:13 - okay I what didn't I did this not update
107:16 - did it reset something oh did I leave
107:19 - that one on ah crap okay that why cuz I
107:24 - left wait no no that is not
107:27 - why okay so I'm not entirely sure
107:29 - because I thought it was
107:30 - regenerating the animations but nope the
107:33 - Scout idle these animations are still
107:35 - here so that wasn't so apparently this
107:38 - one just lost the references for some
107:41 - inexplicable reason I'm not sure why but
107:45 - yep apparently this one just lost the
107:46 - reference okay so let's try dragging
107:49 - them again I have no idea why this one
107:51 - vanished but let's see if
107:56 - now that one go back outside do you have
107:59 - the
108:00 - references that one okay it does okay so
108:03 - let's see yay Works nice or does it
108:07 - work it does but did I put it the yeah I
108:11 - put it the wrong way around yeah so it
108:14 - does work but I put it the wrong way
108:15 - around so the idle is being the walking
108:17 - and then they are I don't so let me just
108:19 - swap that out but yep it did indeed work
108:22 - so
108:23 - uh so this one is not the idle this one
108:25 - is the wonk and this one is the idol all
108:28 - right awesome okay so I think it is I
108:30 - think it is
108:34 - working ah let's try it
108:37 - out and see okay so these are Idol and
108:42 - yep that one it is indeed working so
108:44 - that one is the uh idle uh Scout
108:46 - animation so this kind of that is a
108:47 - little pistol that one has a little AK
108:50 - and as I move y that one is playing the
108:52 - walk animation and as I move this one
108:55 - yep it is playing the Scout walk
108:56 - animation it's quite silly to have such
108:59 - low frame rate animations but I think it
109:01 - looks a little bit
109:02 - fun so yeah I don't know if I'm going to
109:05 - add more frames or leave it sort of like
109:06 - this
109:07 - very very uh sort like that but yeah it
109:12 - does wait and he's is he going to die no
109:14 - don't die a he killed my Scout that
109:17 - sucks oh man um yeah sorry I didn't I
109:21 - totally missed chat while I was
109:23 - reading that
109:29 - [Music]
109:33 - um B is fun but I find it impossible to
109:35 - work live at all yeah I gotta say I
109:38 - definitely right now I'm actually
109:40 - getting a bit better at that a bit
109:41 - better at being able to write some code
109:43 - do some work whilst being live on stream
109:45 - but yeah I remember the first few live
109:46 - streams that I did yeah I did I did feel
109:49 - inside a pretty intense sense of panic
109:51 - feeling a bunch of people watching me
109:53 - and I'm trying to write code and
109:54 - something doesn't work that was
109:55 - definitely very stressful but yeah as
109:57 - with so many things it is something you
109:59 - gain with experience and so far nowadays
110:01 - I can just focus a little bit better so
110:05 - yeah that does work uh quite a little
110:07 - bit are you selling all the meshes on a
110:10 - render mesh array uh I'm not manually
110:13 - but I think that by registering them
110:15 - they do uh register automatically does
110:19 - this oh that one was killed that's why
110:21 - it doesn't show up
110:23 - but yeah on that one so basically I'm
110:26 - I'm uh using this where is there it is
110:29 - so basically I'm going into default
110:31 - World getting the entities graphic
110:33 - system and then from that one calling it
110:34 - to register the mesh and I believe that
110:36 - is a similar method to setting it on the
110:39 - uh mesh array so basically it renders
110:42 - all the meshes
110:44 - and yeah over here on the yeah exactly
110:47 - or no no it does yeah it just this one
110:49 - doesn't have all has those but yeah I
110:52 - Believe by calling this function to
110:55 - um what is this this one to register the
110:58 - mesh I believe that one registers it
111:00 - over here on the render mesh array so
111:02 - yep it does that and then swapping out
111:04 - all the meshes and there you go here is
111:06 - some basic animation and it does work
111:09 - and I've got the animation for the
111:10 - different characters all right so now I
111:12 - got to figure out the animation for the
111:14 - for the zombies I got to figure out some
111:16 - kind of uh vision for that but yeah it
111:19 - is working so I've got uh this uh Marine
111:22 - uh unit right here so that one is
111:24 - working with the won and the idle
111:26 - animation and same thing for this one
111:27 - the won in the idle
111:29 - animation and yeah so he walks around
111:31 - gets there stops and does some idle
111:34 - thing nice all right cool uh you also
111:37 - prer light mode in your ID yep I can't
111:39 - really stand looking at uh dark mode at
111:42 - all if I do if I put this on dark mode
111:44 - I'm going to go blind within within a a
111:47 - few seconds so yep for me it has to be
111:50 - in light mode all the way uh but yeah I
111:53 - do know some people dislike that I wish
111:55 - I could I wish I could use light mode
111:58 - myself but then have like the viewer
112:00 - have some kind of dynamic thing on
112:02 - YouTube where you could switch if you
112:03 - wanted to see it in light mode or dark
112:05 - mode would be nice if such a thing
112:07 - existed but nope videos are fixed so if
112:10 - I if I record in light mode then you
112:12 - have to watch in light mode so sorry for
112:15 - those of you that prefer dark mode but
112:17 - yeah it has to be like
112:20 - that that's concept is kind of hard is
112:22 - isn't it requires a different level of
112:24 - thinking so it's a little bit harder it
112:27 - requires a bit more code to achieve the
112:29 - same thing but it is not necessarily
112:32 - insanely difficult just requires a
112:33 - different mindset but if you get a
112:35 - different mindset than getting it it
112:37 - does work actually relatively all
112:41 - right uh I just registered on Steamworks
112:43 - and chose 30% withhold tax so on top of
112:46 - the 30% seam cut I have to pay an
112:47 - additional 30% this this normal that
112:49 - depends on what country you're from
112:51 - because basically different count have
112:53 - uh I think it's called like double
112:55 - tribut laws something like that or not
112:58 - laws uh Accords deals something like
113:01 - that so basically Portugal and the US
113:04 - has one of those uh deals so yeah for me
113:08 - after submitting the correct forms they
113:11 - they put the withholding tax at 0%
113:14 - because Portugal in the US has a a deal
113:16 - like that so yeah basically you have to
113:18 - you have to figure out how to you have
113:21 - to figure out if your own country has
113:22 - something like that but yeah hopefully
113:23 - it does have I mean the US has deals
113:25 - with pretty much every country so yeah
113:28 - hopefully it won't take away 30% extra
113:30 - because yeah if they take away 60% that
113:32 - does become quite a bit trickier
113:35 - yeah uh you could have a blob asset
113:37 - which has an array of a struct which
113:39 - contains two array of mesh IDs oh nice
113:42 - these structs have the index of the unit
113:44 - type in oh nice yeah I definitely do
113:46 - have to research blob assets because I
113:48 - haven't looked into them much uh I know
113:51 - a rough idea of what they're used for
113:53 - and yeah I do guess for for this system
113:55 - they would make sense as opposed to
113:56 - having just a giant list of fields so
113:58 - yeah this definitely something that I
114:00 - will have to research because it might
114:02 - indeed be the perfect tool for exactly
114:07 - this and show us a h level of how you
114:10 - solve that again I mean for the
114:12 - basically for for the animations the
114:14 - animations are just swapping different
114:16 - meshes so since dots does not have any
114:19 - skin mesh render in order to handle the
114:21 - animations you can't just have a skin
114:22 - mesh render it won't actually I didn't
114:25 - test it but I'm pretty sure just putting
114:26 - a skin mesh render won't animate by
114:27 - default so yeah for handling the
114:29 - animation just swapping out the meshes
114:31 - and the way that it works is basically
114:33 - on the unit the unit has an authoring
114:35 - component which has a reference to all
114:37 - the meshes so here are all the meshes
114:40 - and then over here on this
114:42 - component it basically takes all those
114:44 - meshes goes inside the en's graphic
114:46 - system and registers the meshes this is
114:48 - required so that the entities's renderer
114:50 - knows what mesh to render because over
114:52 - here this one this type batch mesh ID
114:55 - this one is really just a number it
114:56 - doesn't actually store the mesh itself
114:58 - so basically it registers the mesh and
115:00 - doing so it matches a certain mesh
115:03 - object with a certain U value so it
115:05 - matches those things together then you
115:06 - save just that U value and then for
115:09 - modifying the mesh it's over here on
115:11 - this system that I have over here which
115:13 - is this thing the material mesh info
115:14 - this is something from the uh Unity dots
115:17 - rendering and then just over here doing
115:19 - some simple Logic for counting down the
115:20 - animation uh range
115:23 - then counting up the frames then
115:24 - depending on what animation is selected
115:26 - as either two frames or four frames in
115:28 - this case and then just looping back in
115:30 - order to make sure to not go over to
115:32 - some invalid frames and then for
115:33 - swapping mesh just as this goes inside
115:35 - the material mesh info grabs the value R
115:38 - order right wres the mesh ID with what
115:40 - is on the batch mesh ID and that
115:41 - basically swaps out the mesh so
115:43 - basically that's how it works register
115:46 - the mesh swap out the meshes and it has
115:49 - some interesting mesh animation so yeah
115:54 - uh look up material property overrides
115:56 - you won't work for the mesh index but it
115:58 - lets you set per instance shade of
115:59 - values in burst code have to do is set
116:02 - component oh interesting I did uh
116:04 - remember using material property
116:06 - overrides like a real long time ago when
116:09 - I was uh first getting into thatt and
116:10 - that was the the way to do it but I
116:13 - haven't looked at it right now so I'll
116:15 - have to see that cuz yeah I mean
116:17 - eventually the goal is to convert this
116:18 - so first of all I'm just trying to get
116:20 - it working and then after I have it
116:21 - working then I won't want to update this
116:23 - into into some uh into jifi code and
116:29 - yeah at that point I guess I will look
116:30 - into all those options using a material
116:32 - property using a blob asset and maybe
116:34 - with that it should work so we can't use
116:37 - normal 3D models and dots and animated
116:39 - not right now not by default by default
116:42 - dots right now does not have any
116:43 - animation tool set so you either have to
116:46 - build your own kind of like I'm doing
116:47 - here or you can go inside the uh asset
116:50 - sore and there's a bunch of of dots
116:52 - animation systems these are all based on
116:54 - using shaders that modify the vertices
116:57 - so yeah you can either use this or build
116:59 - your own which is kind of what I'm doing
117:03 - here why don't you create mobile games
117:05 - just because I don't normally play
117:07 - mobile games that is roughly the idea I
117:10 - mean mobile is a complete different
117:12 - world from PC steam in order to make
117:15 - good games you have to actually play the
117:17 - games that you want to make so for me
117:18 - since I don't normally play mobile games
117:21 - yeah it makes more sense you
117:23 - I play PC games and I make PC games
117:25 - because the thing that I know but yeah
117:28 - although in general if you know how to
117:29 - make PC games or mobile games you can
117:31 - easily make one or the other in terms of
117:33 - game design in terms of monetization you
117:35 - have to learn a lot of different things
117:36 - but the technical aspect if you know one
117:38 - you know the other so if you want you
117:40 - can definitely go into both
117:44 - those you explain why all the assets I
117:47 - chose from the unity assets
117:50 - or oh Jason answer so yeah it has to do
117:53 - with the render pipeline so basically
117:54 - when you create a brand new
117:57 - project or yeah so basically pink means
118:02 - Shader error so if you're seeing a bunch
118:03 - of pink that is probably because you're
118:06 - not using the uh render pipeline asset
118:09 - that matches with whatever asset you
118:11 - bought I'm guessing whatever asset you
118:12 - bought is using the uh Universal render
118:15 - pipeline but over here when you create
118:17 - the project you probably use one of
118:19 - these two and these two are using the
118:20 - built-in Runner pipeline and if the
118:22 - assets are using uh urp or hrp shaders
118:25 - then won't show up in pink if you use
118:27 - this so either you need to manually
118:29 - install the universal R pipeline or hdrp
118:32 - on your project or create a brand new
118:34 - project and make sure to pick the
118:35 - correct one so it's actually something
118:37 - really awesome how if you select un6 and
118:41 - now by default it is always going to
118:43 - default into urp or hrp and you have to
118:46 - actively go looking for the built-in run
118:48 - pel so I think this one change alone is
118:50 - actually going to be really awesome is
118:52 - going to prevent many of those many of
118:55 - those uh issues cuz yeah I do see a lot
118:57 - of those comments why are my Assets in
118:59 - pink and the answer is because that's
119:01 - because when creating a brand new
119:02 - project people just default to the
119:04 - default option which default into the
119:06 - built and run pipeline so yeah the fact
119:08 - that Unity 6 will default into urp and
119:10 - hrp hopefully that will actually lead to
119:13 - a lot uh fewer confused people which is
119:16 - always
119:19 - nice oh another Super Chat
119:22 - hey no no thanks uh there anything that
119:24 - ryer offers that vs do not I mean Jason
119:27 - probably is a a better person to answer
119:29 - that
119:31 - uh because I'm not sure I know ryer has
119:34 - tons and tons of features but then again
119:36 - so does visual studio which honestly I
119:38 - don't really use uh that many features I
119:40 - use it as just a normal code editor like
119:43 - I know it has tons of like uh things for
119:46 - analyzing your code doing all kinds of
119:48 - code analysis I know Visual Studio has a
119:50 - massive amount of features but really I
119:52 - use it as just a uh code editor just
119:54 - writing it so yeah for me I really
119:56 - just uh use it super simple but I do
119:59 - know that wrer does have uh quite a lot
120:01 - of extra features so I definitely
120:04 - encourage you to look at it because
120:06 - apparently it is free for education and
120:08 - those things so yeah definitely try it
120:10 - out and then we'll
120:13 - see uh okay so yeah so 640 so yeah let
120:18 - me just uh
120:22 - mainly Havey Unity integration for
120:24 - example it shows the value oh yeah
120:25 - that's nice oh that is useful yeah uh
120:29 - see don't get those annoying calization
120:30 - mistake varable issues when you are
120:32 - confused why it doesn't change yeah that
120:34 - is useful yeah having sometimes where
120:36 - you Mouse over and shows you what it
120:38 - shows what the value you set in the
120:40 - editor yeah I guess that integration can
120:42 - be indeed quite helpful yeah nice uh I
120:45 - guess for me I'm so used to I know where
120:48 - my data lives in general I know what
120:50 - type of data I normally write in the
120:51 - editor what type I normally do so for me
120:54 - I don't normally have that issue but
120:55 - yeah I guess for people who don't know
120:57 - why they're modifying something and
120:58 - doesn't show then yeah having just
121:00 - something that shows you okay you are
121:01 - modifying this field in the editor so
121:03 - whatever you write here in the code does
121:04 - not matter yeah that would definitely
121:06 - help solve quite a lot of
121:15 - frustration also shows what scripts are
121:18 - you used in that in what scene oh that's
121:20 - nice I didn't know that one that does
121:22 - sound quite useful
121:25 - nice so can you copy your soldier a
121:27 - thousand times now without
121:29 - slowdown that's a good question why
121:31 - don't we try it I'm guessing this is not
121:34 - going to go well but uh so yeah
121:38 - basically so the spawning should be
121:39 - working so let me just
121:42 - see okay so the spawning is working uh
121:47 - where did I put now I don't remember
121:48 - where did I put the spawning logic I
121:51 - think I put it on a script B
121:53 - object or nope I didn't nope okay so
121:58 - where did I put that now I got to
121:59 - remember how how did I set this up so
122:02 - it's on the building Barracks is it on
122:03 - the barracks that I hardcoded the
122:06 - value uh no I put it yeah I put it on
122:09 - the oh on the building Barracks
122:12 - component wait on the
122:19 - component where did I oh never mind so
122:22 - the en's reference yeah okay okay so
122:25 - that's where it is
122:28 - uh except oh all right so I hardcoded it
122:31 - in here okay so instead of taking 5
122:33 - seconds if I put it on
122:36 - 0.1 will this now take just 0.1 second
122:40 - to generate one let's
122:46 - see uh so I place down some Barracks I
122:49 - selected I go and there you go every
122:50 - point one okay nice so now let me go
122:53 - onto the uh building Barrack
122:57 - system and for each one that's or I
123:00 - guess I guess let me try playing around
123:04 - with the UI instead okay so let's see
123:07 - this let's go inside the Barra Y and
123:10 - over here I'm using a dynamic buffer in
123:12 - order to do that so I'm doing an add so
123:14 - for in IAL Z let's go
123:18 - 100 okay so let's see
123:20 - this okay get the feeling this is going
123:23 - to be quite messy but let's see if it
123:27 - works
123:31 - uh okay so basically now I can play some
123:33 - barracks and when I put it it is
123:37 - going all right I mean okay let's see
123:42 - the uh where do I see how many units the
123:44 - empty count
123:47 - uh what do I want where do I see the
123:49 - units
123:51 - yeah I guess they also have yeah but
123:54 - they all go into the same place CU
123:58 - they're okay now spawn a whole bunch of
124:01 - them so yeah yeah they're all going into
124:04 - a pile all going to the exact same place
124:07 - just keep spawning more and more
124:10 - units oh it's interesting so if I hide
124:13 - the UI it's actually fine but if I sh oh
124:15 - never mind yeah cuz the UI I totally
124:17 - forgot yeah so that performance issue is
124:19 - probably because the UI is super massive
124:21 - let's actually look at the
124:24 - UI uh where's the UI oh God I can't even
124:28 - move it can let me pause
124:30 - it why oh because I have hidden the UI
124:33 - here building Barracks okay
124:36 - yeah that's the issue all of those yeah
124:39 - all of these Sprites for the units being
124:41 - being que that is why this is being
124:44 - quite slow yeah if I deselect then it
124:47 - does work like that but if I select that
124:48 - one yeah still a massive queue
124:52 - uh
124:53 - okay so but yeah like this it's uh
124:58 - running at 25 I wonder what is the main
125:02 - thing uh giv can I open up the the Z
125:06 - profiler helping seeing
125:11 - something so the profiler is having some
125:13 - spikes what are these
125:17 - spikes what is taking half a second oh
125:20 - it's the editor okay well that makes
125:24 - sense but now it's the player and
125:26 - generating some garbage on the
125:28 - simulation system group and on the
125:30 - render pipeline really the render
125:31 - pipeline is generating some garbage are
125:34 - the rendering the camera
125:37 - stack oh Define Target oh no but it is
125:41 - not generating but it is okay
125:43 - interesting so now so I guess what
125:45 - someone a while ago was saying about uh
125:48 - about physics queries being slow I guess
125:50 - maybe that is the
125:52 - the
125:53 - thing so yeah definitely well I mean
125:55 - keep in mind that over here I'm not
125:56 - using any uh wait spawn them
126:00 - all nice so is it 600 units because this
126:04 - one says 4,000 oh because I guess each
126:07 - of them has different things so yeah but
126:10 - if I disable
126:12 - the this defined Target system can I
126:15 - can't I disable the system is it over
126:16 - here yeah there you go if I disable that
126:18 - one so basally the physics queries well
126:20 - I mean I guess they have to be uh
126:23 - optimized using jobs cuz right now I'm
126:25 - pretty sure that it's running a physics
126:26 - query for each of them but yeah if not
126:29 - then over here it is spawning tons and
126:30 - tons of units all of them go into a pile
126:33 - because they all go into the exact same
126:35 - position as all of them so I can click
126:38 - them individually to move them away but
126:42 - yeah so yeah I mean I'm pretty sure that
126:44 - if it was using Game objects right now
126:46 - it will already be quite slow so yeah
126:48 - just in this quick little demo it does
126:51 - showcase all kinds
126:53 - of uh interesting things so yeah that
126:57 - does work tons of units tons of stuff
127:00 - spawning units spawning things yeah good
127:03 - for a zombie game yeah exactly dots is
127:05 - perfect so the goal is on the final game
127:07 - to try out and see just how many units
127:09 - are going to are going to be supported
127:11 - how many zombies can I can I get I mean
127:14 - the inspiration for this is very much
127:16 - the store. Ste power uh Ste power.com is
127:21 - is very much they are bains you have
127:23 - something against the V keyword uh I
127:25 - wouldn't necessarily say against just
127:27 - because that sounds very very uh
127:30 - negative but personally I am not a fan
127:32 - of it so I'm not a fan because of how it
127:36 - uh hides away the types that I'm using
127:38 - so generally I don't like that's
127:40 - actually something that I dislike on the
127:43 - uh Unity
127:45 - um uh on their code samples they use VAR
127:49 - quite a lot and sometimes it can make
127:51 - sense like over here okay sure so I can
127:53 - see VAR this one is going to be of type
127:54 - La Builder but there are many times like
127:57 - for example over here this one VAR
127:59 - result and it's a result of this
128:01 - function what does this function return
128:03 - I have no idea so that is why it does
128:05 - like VAR like just looking at this code
128:07 - I have no idea what object what type
128:09 - this is going to return so I have no no
128:11 - idea what this is is this a bullan is it
128:13 - a a blob Builder is it a blob asset is
128:16 - it something like that so yeah I don't
128:17 - like how VAR eliminates things so I can
128:21 - understand in things like this but when
128:22 - it's something like calling a function
128:24 - and it is not immediately clear as to
128:26 - what exactly it's going to return that
128:28 - is where I really doesn't like using VAR
128:30 - because I find that it just makes the
128:31 - code much more confusing needlessly
128:34 - confusing so there's no no benefit it
128:36 - just becomes quite a bit more confusing
128:38 - so that is why personally I'm not a fan
128:40 - of VAR but as you can see here Unity
128:42 - themselves they like VAR a lot of people
128:44 - like using VAR so if you like it go
128:46 - ahead and use it but me personally I
128:48 - like my code to be as explicit as
128:50 - possible I want to know for certain what
128:52 - type I'm using with so what type I'm
128:54 - working with so that is why personally I
128:56 - normally do not use VAR but yep over
128:58 - here they do like using it so if you
129:01 - don't like using it then definitely go
129:02 - ahead and use
129:09 - it what's your batching looking like
129:12 - good question I assume it's all nicely
129:14 - batched or not I never know which one
129:18 - okay so right now it's not being batched
129:20 - is that
129:23 - is that the
129:25 - case I'm trying to think
129:28 - if
129:32 - uh okay so I guess this is why I'm going
129:34 - to have to use the material property
129:36 - block because I'm guessing that is why
129:38 - these but the measures should be
129:44 - shared so that's an that's an
129:47 - interesting one yeah definitely
129:48 - something that I won't have to research
129:50 - and see exactly how it's going
129:52 - to uh how does it batch things like why
129:55 - is it not batching anything I would
129:57 - guess that at least the ones that are on
129:58 - the same frame would be batched or maybe
130:01 - I just need to enable some kind of thing
130:03 - I'm not sure but uh yeah so definitely
130:06 - something slight instancing on material
130:08 - oh good question did I is that not uh
130:12 - enabled where's my material I got to
130:14 - find my material so I got ton of stuff
130:15 - on this
130:17 - project uh is it not instance nope
130:22 - enable it but nope did not change what
130:25 - about yeah the other one doesn't have
130:28 - so frame profiler does the frame
130:31 - profiler show
130:34 - something wait yeah
130:40 - the uh so you got the
130:46 - UI oh rendering the background yeah but
130:50 - this I never know how to how to work
130:53 - with this but I'm pretty sure this means
130:55 - that this is being batched
131:00 - right does the does the frame debugger
131:04 - have some kind of D profile or
131:08 - something because over here it does seem
131:11 - like it is being batched like it is
131:12 - rendering all these and then another
131:14 - group and then another group and so on
131:16 - so it does seem like it is being batg
131:18 - here so I'm not sure why that one over
131:22 - here doesn't say it but it seems like it
131:25 - so yeah I'm not sure I'll definitely
131:27 - have to SRP batching is not relevant
131:30 - here the stats window is wrong basically
131:32 - oh okay interesting uh let's look in the
131:36 - uh just see regular profiler on the
131:39 - rendering down
131:40 - here what does this guy say this one
131:43 - does say 1.3k drw calls something like
131:49 - that but the
131:56 - say not sure definitely going to have to
131:58 - research this quite a bit but I might
131:59 - have to use the material property Block
132:02 - in order to make it render properly so
132:05 - I'm not sure but yeah I'll have to
132:08 - figure that
132:11 - out been a fun break from work but I
132:14 - should get back to my own yeah yeah
132:15 - thanks Jason thanks for being here uh
132:17 - should have a chat at some shade yeah
132:20 - yeah I don't think so yeah
132:21 - I've met Andrew when it was at GDC but I
132:24 - don't think I've met you so yeah that
132:25 - would be fun so someday so yeah bye
132:28 - enjoy enjoy your work uh okay yeah and
132:32 - I'm going to have to be going as well
132:33 - since it's almost 7 p.m and my my dogs
132:36 - are starting to wake up starting to be a
132:38 - little bit fidgety but still this was a
132:41 - successful live stream so I want to
132:42 - research how to do some uh physics
132:45 - queries look at the trigger logic and it
132:48 - did work cuz if I go over here and what
132:51 - we did in the beginning of this live
132:53 - stream so yeah turns out that finding uh
132:55 - doing trigger is actually surprisingly
132:57 - simple go inside the simulation
132:58 - Singleton grab the trigger events or the
133:00 - Collision events then do a four each
133:02 - through all of them and apparently that
133:04 - works so that was much easier than I
133:07 - thought it would be and then for
133:09 - handling the animations yep the core
133:12 - basic idea I still have to try a
133:14 - different other approaches but the core
133:16 - idea is indeed working so
133:19 - yeah all right
133:21 - okay so let me stop this and thanks
133:24 - again and now for the super chat then
133:26 - thank you all so much for being here I
133:29 - hope you found this interesting and let
133:31 - me just put it like that and that will
133:34 - be
133:36 - it put that yeah there's no Dy dynamic
133:40 - or static batching for Dots rendering
133:42 - okay yeah I definitely have to uh look
133:45 - into that topic to see what exactly is
133:47 - going wrong if something is going wrong
133:49 - so I don't know I'll definitely have to
133:50 - look at into that um we're okay yeah was
133:55 - the music even playing did the music
133:57 - stop oh I guess my my music stopped a
134:00 - long time ago and I didn't even notice
134:02 - anyways uh okay so let me put that one
134:04 - into that one and that one all right so
134:07 - yeah uh uh thank you all for being here
134:10 - and I hope you have a great rest of your
134:12 - week and I will see you maybe next week
134:15 - something like that didn't know there
134:16 - was supposed to be music there was but
134:18 - apparently it crashed a while ago so
134:21 - anyways uh okay so yeah have a great
134:23 - rest of your uh day week whatever and I
134:27 - will see you next time all right so bye
134:29 - everyone bye bye
134:50 - bye
135:19 - e for

Cleaned transcript:

is for all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great Tuesday today thank you all so much for being here nice already quite a lot of people that's fun all right uh post this and yep everything's good all right great so yep basically I'm still doing some research on my upcoming dots RTS game uh so yeah I've got a bunch of things that I want to research uh primarily doing animation and physics those are two things that I'm really trying to trying to get to work in this prototype so when will the course be done not sure it depends a lot it depends on how the how soon I can get this protyp finished so first I got to get this fully done and then I can start to plan out all the lectures the whole thing for the entire course so yeah I don't know I don't know exactly when Maybe by uh the middle of next month I should have a better ideas for now I'm still very much just doing a ton of research like for example for this for handling physics uh this is something that I haven't yet I mean I've been using physics which is actually uh pretty easy to do but I haven't yet looked into Collision events and Trigger events so this actually something something that I very much would like to research please research n code for enties yeah eventually afterwards I mean ideally I would like to make uh this course kind of what I did with kitchen chaos which is make it a single player thing and then a second one turning it into multiplayer I think that that would be fun but yeah definitely net Cod Ford is still going to take a little while until I until I actually uh have the time to research that because yeah uh okay so yeah so basally let me look into so basically doing some research live on stream because I haven't yet looked into how to handle Collision events I've looked at the documentation over here and it's actually it seems like it's somewhat simple to do so basically I can get the singl ton for the simulation and then grab some kind of trigger events and then iterate through them and apparently that will work so that is kind of what I'm going to uh try to see how it works so yeah let's try doing that so first I'm going to well actually first well actually first here is the the current uh project right now already got quite a lot of mechanics so I've got unit selection so I can select I can select a bunch of them tell them where to move there are different Unity types so this one is a unit kind of like this and that little small one that one moves quite a bit faster same thing for the enemies they got multiple enemies then the units they also find and attack all kinds of things and there there is a health system and the enemies are also patrolling around so they Patrol the B bullets go ahead they shoot the enemies also attack the player and then I can also easily spawn some enemies and I can spawn some barracks and from those Barracks I can spawn the building and start spawning some units so that is also done and I can start generating some resources so I can place down buildings to generate some supposedly gold or wood so already quite got quite a lot of things over here but there's still quite a bit more that I uh still have left to do so let's see you feel with all your experience you still often learn and have to look things up absolutely I mean especially when it's things that are new like for example this Dots Dots is very much new to me no matter how much experience I have so yeah I've definitely read a ton of the documentation over here on the physics package on the normal Unity on the uh entities package yeah definitely reading a ton of documentation doing a bunch of Googling and just a ton of trial and error write some code try to see if it works doesn't work try again so yep I'm definitely still looking things up up still learning uh so yeah that is one of those things that is very much a constant thing so yeah that is definitely person perfectly normal I have question on CCS so you do on update to find all the entities that contain something and so on and then execute code like follow the player yep but is there a way to get a reference to a bowling variable to check if the game is paused uh yes I mean first of all you can mix between uh dots and game objects so for example where's my unit mover system unit mover system and this is throwing out this warning which is very strange so yeah Bas L dots you've got an on update then you do a 4 each on that 4 each you do some kind of system query and you grab all the components that you want so for example this is the unit mover system so this is the uh system that is actually moving all of the individual units so I do a query in order to find the local transform this one is basically basically the same as the transform component so has a position rotation and scale then I've got the target position I made this uh custom component myself just to have a movement speed and a Target position so that's the position where the unit should move to and then the physics velocity this one is part of the dots physics and using that I can basically set the velocity directly so basically I do a query to find all of those I grab uh all of those components and then using those over here calculate the move Direction so just some super simple basic movement code so just grab the target position and the current position to calate the move Direction then just take the set the physics velocity linear to that move Direction multiply by some kind of move speed and then using physics basically that's how it moves the unit so in terms of updating yeah you can definitely have a a bullan so if you use burst then inside of burst you cannot access other things but you could very much write this code inside of a job and you would have that job be bured but then over here on update you would take away the Burse compile and over here you can access some kind of instance last just like you just like you would on any normal C code so for example I've got the game assets class and this one is a standard mono Behavior class so you can access game objects and mod Behavior things from inside the entities code entities world so you can do that well Ring trailer drop is that true oh that's nice uh so you can access that or alternatively you can go for example from the system API in order to get the Singleton so you can have you can create a Singleton component meaning a component of which there exists only one thing and you can sort some kind of bulling there some kind of bulling fly for updating things or not and you can do get Singleton in order to find the component of that so let's say if I only had a single Target position then this would get that t position and then from that I could access some kind of field inside of it which could be a bullion and then depending on the value of that run this for each or not so yep plenty of ways to do all kinds of those things changing meshed material properties still look weak to me on dots yeah those are definitely still uh uh complicated that is also that is something that I very much want to try out in this uh uh in this uh live stream because yeah I've managed to figure out the idea for how it works and basically you need this you need the material mesh info this is a builtin thing from the unity rendering and you can basically go inside it and modify the mesh ID now that mesh ID that is not an actual mesh reference you have to basically register the mesh so over here I've got a B component which has a regular mesh and then there's a dots component which has a thing of type batch mesh ID and then over here I'm simply going through the en graph system in order to register the mesh which in turn returns this and then on this system I can use that film in order to mod modified mesh so this is how basically over here there's this little character it's being animated this is a fully dots character this is not a game object so this if I look inside of the runtime entity thing yep over there you can see yep it has the material mesh info and you can see over here the mesh index that one is modifying that One is updating between one and two that is how this one is doing some slight animation just changing meshes one uh uh just changing between meshes in order to make some kind of Animation so that is the rough idea how to change the color of a 2d Sprite but entity that's a good question because I still haven't yet looked into much on um on using Sprite render in dots I do believe it does work like I tried it and it seemed to work but so far I've been using just 3D elements so I'm not entirely sure but um so yeah I would have to look into that but if you're using a mesh then I do believe on one of these you can modify the uh material the same way that you would modify a mesh and that's only complex yeah right now for making animations inside of dots it is definitely very complex unnecessarily complex which is why it's on the road map for the next thing to do to actually have some builtin support for animations but so far you have to either do it manually like this or go on the accur and pick up one of the several assets that already exist that handle the animations right away and that is actually uh and it should work quite well I mean if I wasn't making a course if I was making this game just for myself just making a game to put on seam just a normal he T like a machine gun am I talking too fast uh so yeah if I was making this game just for myself I would definitely go on to the assur pick up one of those s in order to handle the dots animations but since it's a course on the course I don't want the course to be dependent on third party asset so that is why in the course I'm going to teach how to make uh normal animation and yep so this is the main method that I'm going for but anyways before that I really want to try this out look into how to handle events so let's see this and actually right now I think actually don't know if by default it is going to have some kind of thing and a non dos version of this that is actually an interesting question maybe if I can find the time I would like to uh basically remake the game using just game objects in order to see exactly what the difference is between dots and non dos that could be interesting although it might also be a ton of work so not entirely sure but it would definitely be a fun project okay so let me create a new system so test collisions system something like this and now inside of it so I don't need the on create I don't need that one and that one okay so now on the on update so basically I have to cycle through what is it okay I have to get the Singleton of type simulation Singleton so in the system API get Singleton of type simulation Singleton and on this one I call as simulation which apparently returns a simulation whatever that is and then I can get Collision events or trigger events so let's get the trigger events okay so this one I believe it says that it's going to be a collection which I then iterate through it uh on the trigger events let me inspect this uh it just has trigger events but how do I okay why is this commented that's a good question so is it innumerable or is it not inumerable that's interesting why is this why is this uh commented oh do I go through the and why is this commented okay that's a bit strange Firebase Google login system I've never really used Firebase so I don't really know how how that works but as far as I know they have some really great docks so I would definitely look into that look into the docks to see uh how it works okay so why is this one not so if I try doing a for each on this one for each trigger event trigger event in this is this going to work okay so I'm not entirely sure why this is working or rather I'm not entirely sure why why over here this one the uh trigger events why is this one commenting out the I numerator I have no idea but okay so if it works then maybe it works let's we debug down log on this trigger event and this trigger event has what oh it's got the entities that were involved the bodies and so on so just printing it out should print something just nope I don't want that one I want using Unity engine okay so doing a log and basically if there is a trigger vent then that's you me like can join live stream hey welcome Mara yeah it's uh it's a uh definitely would like to have a more regular live stream schedule but so far it is still very much random when it happens okay why are you having burst invalid argument okay I have no idea what that was but okay and this this uh down log just to make sure that this system is actually running cuz I think right now it won't be running but it's actually not going to have anything hey huge fan hey thanks uh thanks for watching the videos I Hope they've helped you quite a lot uh okay so the system is working but yep there's nothing actual happening all right good how do you record tutorial I use OBS to record the screen which uh the screen in the camera actually it all records the same thing and yeah which is actually a pretty awesome program super easy to use okay what do I want so let me create a new 3D cube okay let me put this one in authoring and for this Cube I'm going to make it a trigger and can I scale it will this actually scale I assume so okay so that one is basically going to be a trigger and then can I create a new a 3D object a sphere loging is better than debugger in dots oh interesting I'm not familiar with unity. logging I'm using this just for just for testing so I'm not too worried about about uh performance but what is Unity not logging there's a loging package okay I did not know about this is a versatile and highly configurable structured a synchronous logging solution okay so it should be good for logging inside of vered code inside of jobs I assume contains various ways to stream record the logs onto all kinds of things all right good The Collection package and can be used without ECS okay so that is actually interesting I did not know about so yeah thanks for the tip I'll definitely look into it afterwards cuz yeah I imagine that when using tons of jobs like so far I'm not using any jobs so I'm not using anything uh too insanely complex but yeah when using when using uh jobs look at that gifted memberships I didn't know that YouTube had such a thing all right uh thanks so much snar for the gifted memberships yeah what was this at okay I had no idea that's the first time that I that I've seen that but okay so apparently a bunch of people get gifted oh thank thanks so much snar for the Super Chat and the gifted memberships okay that is that's an interesting one yeah I thought only twitch had because as far as I know YouTube live streams are still very much behind in terms of uh having all kinds of features but apparently it has gifted memberships okay so that's that's fun yeah thanks that should be should be quite interesting uh uh okay let me just add a rigid body just to make this one fall down so now if I render where's my sphere and put the sphere right there let me actually change the material do I have my bullet material somewhere my bullet material just make it nice and visible okay and make it quite a bit bigger okay so let's see if the okay it falls down goes goes through it oh right cuz the bottom is not dots based yep it did work it did find a trigger event all right awesome so that's apparently because it goes in and yep it does trigger a trigger event all right so right away that is uh quite good recently started using Unity for university project your tutorials have been a lifesaver nice maybe I'll start making projects on my own too yeah definitely go for it that's awesome yeah uh great job on starting your Learning Journey yeah now just continue and keep at it keep on learning um any forign lessons on Mark marketing nice yeah marketing does one of those things extremely important and extremely difficult so yeah uh uh where was I I'm to following the the route of a Game Dev who makes lots of small games instead of dream games and that really helps nice nice that's awesome yeah definitely making small games making multiple games helps you quite a lot in in uh being able to in being able to learn ton of things not just marketing but everything but yeah in terms of marketing is one those things that is definitely really tricky uh it is it is something that I amazed myself at how much I did not know like when I when I started making games on on Steam which to be fair back then in 2013 there wasn't necessarily as much competition as there is nowadays so back then for the first few games that I did I could get away with not knowing much about marketing but yeah since then I definitely have had to learn quite a lot and yeah it is something very important so yeah definitely uh keep on learning that because yeah marketing is indeed quite important uh okay so let me just let me just see this um say oh sarf yeah thank you so much yeah although it's kind of strange how you gifted memberships but apparently it doesn't give yourself one that's a bit on so it like gifts uh five memberships but you yourself don't keep one of those I would have assumed that if someone give some memberships it would the system would first give that person the the membership before giving someone else but okay I wonder if that's different from how it is on on Twitch that's definitely an interesting thing so but yeah uh thanks so much for the isn't it NTB it isn't oh I forgot to pause uh so yeah thanks so much that is nice um okay so just verifying that this is indeed working which I believe it is working so let me go and that one falls down and touches and as soon as it touches yep got a collision between 381 and 382 and if I go and I see the cube in the sphere let's see which one this is so go inside of runtime and this one is 382 and sphere yep it is 381 all right awesome so the Collision is indeed working so basically this is how you test for collisions which is actually uh really surprisingly simple yeah I thought handling collisions would have been quite sub to you on my other account by one bite okay awesome yeah thanks uh so yeah I thought collisions would be uh quite difficult but apparently not apparently it's literally just one line of code although uh if you want to make it super fast then yeah they recommend over here oh where did I click they recommend over here that you should be using a collision event job or a trigger event job but for simple things actually this is uh surprisingly easy so yeah there you go that's collisions surprisingly easy let me actually just copy paste this code for my own notes cuz I was working on uh making a video talking about the basics of not physics so let me just copy paste this code on there just so I remember just how easy it is although it does have one issue which is how since Do's physics is stateless meaning it has no state that is why this one over here this trigger vent doesn't actually contain that much information so it has the oh the event dat I wonder what that is I wonder why I can't access it but yeah so this one has an entity another entity a body another body so C the keys and so on but yeah it doesn't have anything to say okay this is an ont trigger enter or on trigger exit event or on trigger St it doesn't mention any of that so it just a trigger vent and that is all the information you get so you basically need to and I actually was seeing I was watching this super useful video actually by unity Japan which is quite surprising how Unity has a Japanese uh Channel which is separate it's presented by KIRO make some really great videos uh and uh it's on subtitle so actually if you want to learn Unity I can also say this channel is really awesome so on this one yeah talking about how do cuz he mentioned over here there was a a helper function of something get Singleton get the objects yes so basally teaching how to make the the things so oh another another thanks uh oh boy way too many tabs yeah one bite thanks so much let's do another gift ah thank you thanks so much that that's really nice only moolly white ID yep my brain only works on the or rather my eyes only work on the white ID so if I try to look at dark mode I very quickly get very messed up get massive headaches so yep for me it has to be okay so I think it's at the stateful trigger event authoring which apparent I know if that's a builtin thing or if that is something that flashbang for some of us yeah I'm sorry about that I wish I could make it different for myself and for you but nope sorry for the spam not spam at all yeah thank you so much I hope you I hope my videos have helped you quite a lot so yeah thanks so much uh uh what was the component let me just see see if this one does work state fall trigger event authoring although I think think this one stap full yeah doesn't have here so I think this one is on the on the uh official dot samples so I have to look into those in order to look at these um helper functions cuz these do seem to be uh quite useful so let's see I think it is a trigger State Collision save by default yep that is that is correct so basically over here the uh the Collision this one is going to fire for as long as the trigger is happening so but yeah you can't yeah you need to handle something in order to figure out okay this just stting so this is an enter this just ended so it's an exit and so on so yeah definitely so yeah those helper functions are probably going to be very useful so I definitely have to look into the uh sample project in order to see that but yeah just just by default I'm surprised at how easy it is to uh listen to Collision events just a uh a simple system a symol for each that actually works so that's nice how do you record do you speak and record at the same time or first record and speak I record and speak at the same time so First I write the entire script for the video tutorial whatever it is I write the entire script then I have the script over here on my second Monitor and I'm recording the main monitor as I'm uh reading the script doing the tutorial while also maybe having the camera on and so on so yeah basically do a ton of work beforehand and then for recording just press record read the script do the thing and yep that's kind of how it goes in Japan channel is even better than the official Unity yeah it does have a lot of really some things it's quite it's quite surprising how this is a separate Channel I mean makes sense cuz it's uh in Japanese but it all has excellent subtitle so yeah I'm guessing many of you many people do not know that uh this channel exists but I definitely I recommend you look into it because they do have some really awesome uh tutorials lots of things and it's all nicely subtitled so yeah really great Learning Channel has quite a lot more learning things than the normal uh thing dos is so difficult yes or no uh it's a different type of thinking but once you start thinking in a different way it is not necessarily that much more difficult so you have to switch your brain in thinking a different way but once you do once you understand how all the syntax Works doing a doing a simple query or accessing Singleton queries on the system API and so on a lot of the things are actually relatively uh simple so yeah okay wow another five wow so it went from not knowing this feature existed to all of a sudden being used three times during during one live stream so so thank you Ma thanks so much it's uh it's actually really funny cuz yeah I hadn't seen I did not know that this was a thing that existed so yeah thanks you so much babyon bite my Jean thanks to all of you this has definitely been quite fun yeah Ma thank you nice uh I don't like read documentation just focus in general I have ADHD not to crud myself but it's difficult to be able to read documentation or guide chat GPT is a blessing I mean uh to uh to that I would say whatever helps you so if you prefer using chat GPD and if you find that that helps absolutely go ahead and use that I mean uh me personally the main way that I like to learn is by watching videos which is probably obvious given the fact that I make uh tutorial videos basically that is the way that I like to learn so the first thing I do do whenever I go to learn something I go on YouTube I find all kinds of videos tutorials to teach whatever it is that I'm trying to learn however when it comes to things like this dots there's really not that much uh educational content around or rather the things that exist they are a bit outdated so I do still watch those but then I've got to go uh read the entire documentation in order to figure out how it all works which thankfully Unity actually does have pretty good documentations over here the the physics package this one is actually surprisingly good and same thing for the uh uh Unity entities package that one also has a really great so you go up here put in version 1.2 and Y this one has a getting started guide it has all kinds of things how to install all the various things all the concepts for how everything works so the documentation is actually surprisingly indepth very detailed so but yeah uh definitely I also very much prefer uh watching a video as opposed to following reading just documentation but if there are no videos then has to be documentation so it's a little bit more difficult but you can definitely you can definitely do it uh are you able to make a guide video on how to do your research uh it's a good question but I think that would be a tricky thing to put on a v i mean how do you do my research is exactly what I'm doing right now which is I look at documentation I try to read the syntax then I go into n project start writing down some code and figure out how it works so that is roughly how I do it but yeah doing a video just on that it's a bit it's one of those things that is quite tricking to make into a video but uh but in terms of uh how I learn yeah that's pretty much it read documentation write some code go back and forth and so on yeah I guess it feels like there's a cheat code I mean there's really not it's one of those things where the main thing is really just uh just experience so the more the more things you make the more time you spend making things easier it becomes to learn new things so by now I've already learned many many new things I've made many many uh games so anytime that I'm doing something new it's just basically doing the same thing that I've already done many many times when I've learn many many other things so yeah at some point learning also becomes a skill that you also can get quite a bit better at okay let me just uh try to see okay that one Supply defense is working okay let me just uh try to let me let me think for a little bit on how I'm going to Handel the the thing five more thanks so much yeah yeah thanks I I hope my hope my answers have helped you uh that's still missing key features such as animation particles I actually think particles are super I'm not 100% sure but I think so but yeah animations doesn't when someone have an idea about a game and has so many objects and that objects have so many animations and particles can it be done yes it can be done and like I was saying you a while ago so for this course I'm going to implement a simple animation system which is exactly what I have here so it's all based on very low frame rate just swapping meshes back and forth so basically before a while ago when I was doing some research I baked a bunch of meshes so there it is so instead of having a skin mesh renderer that moves the bones and modifies all kinds of things and I instead I baked uh those animations I baked them into meshes so now for handling the animation basically what I'm going to do is just swap out the meshes between the various enties but if I wasn't doing this for a course then asset store unity.com if I was making this for a course if I was making it for my own game uh ECS animation there's a bunch of really awesome animation systems these are based on GPU so basically they render the uh skin mesh render all those vertex positions they render those onto a texture and then use that texture with a a custom Shader in order to read the texture and modify the vertices to to actually trigger the animation oh crap cooking settings um so yeah basically if I wasn't making this for the course and this is ex what I would do use one of these systems which already Works quite well but in order for the course to not be dependent on third party assets over here I'm going to do some very simple just based on swapping meeses okay so let me try to let me try to figure out how am I going to implement this okay so CU I was making a test animation so thanks so much Ma uh so basically I already had this one where I baked a bunch of meshes now the question is going to be how do I store the me one really tricky thing about dots is how you can't can't really have lists because lists are uh lists don't have a fixed size whereas in thatt you can't have Dynamic buffers but I don't think a dynamic buffer of a mesh would work well so so I think vertex animation textures better option if looking for performance AI uh uh vertex animation that is uh exactly how how those asset Works they render the the thing onto a I don't think it shows here yeah basically they render it onto a texture and then texture does some vertex animation in order to move the vertices and that's how it moves so yeah that is why that is how that one managed to be quite good blob asset reference uh yeah I don't think uh storing a mesh in a blob asset okay I think maybe this one of those scenarios where I'm overthinking things a little bit so I'm going to any channel member hey Alex hey thanks so much for becoming Channel member uh okay so let me try to think for a little bit okay I think I'm just going to make some uh okay cool um there's un sample code but skin Mees m oh is there oh I did not I did not know background dog is made by dogs yes it's my dog walking around on this floor he makes quite a bit of noise uh Rec working on the console version of dinky Gardens uh that's my plan but yeah right now definitely on pause so yeah I was planning to to work on that after finishing the C course but in the time between that un6 preview came out so I got I had to uh I started working on this so yeah very much still want to do it but yeah it's uh ah tricky so many things that I want to do okay so I think I'm going to simply just have a fields for everything I think that is going to be the S thing so for example put Marine idle zero then Marine idle one and then I'm going to have let's just say the W uh Marine walk zero I think it has one two three just three just three okay so now up here let me do all those so I got Marine idle zero idle one Marine walk zero 1 2 3 one two and three okay so now here let me put all those so the idle one then the won zero won one so basically this is rendering rendering not uh registering all the meshes with the render system okay so now so basically this one stores okay let me think so basically I need to keep track of the current frame that I'm playing the current animation as well so I need some kind of inum for the animation type so let's say Marine Idol and Marine won okay so I need that and then I need a float for the animation timer something like that then some animation timer Max in order to know when to swap to the next frame and then I need an INT for the current frame and then I'm going to need some kind of function in order to get the next frame which I shouldn't be putting logic in this so I'm going to have to refactor this afterwards because and let me sort the uh public animation type and animation type so I store the animation type I store the current frame the timer which I'm going to increase and the timer Max and so on so basically this one is going to set and it's going to so let's say for example I just need to set the timer Max and let's say at 0.5 so basically every .5 seconds it is supposed to swap out and for the animation type for this one let's put on the Marine idle okay so let me let me think okay so basally I've got a type so I know which animation I'm supposed to yeah basally I'm going to need some kind of uh platform as the me sorry I'm trying to trying to focus so I'm not reading much of chat right now uh what platform will the RTS course it will be on my own website because I'm going to try to do basically make the course a normal paid premium course but then also have a uh free version on YouTube with like I don't know the first half of the course something like that so yeah in order to do that kind of uh special thing yeah it has to be just on my website because yud me does not allow uh making a free version and a paid version at the same time so in order to do something like that yeah it's basically going to be on my website with a free version over here which should be hopefully should allow lots of people to learn quite a lot okay let me just let me just uh okay so I've got the animation tab so I know that I'm running this animation I know basically I need to get what is the next frame but I don't think uh so I'm trying to think do I put this inside a scripal object because a scripal object could hold the various okay anyways maybe I'm I think I'm no cuz the issue is cuz I've got the uh okay now this is ah okay I think I'm I think I'm thinking way too far ahead I think I'm just going to have a bunch of ifs and then see how it goes so anyways okay so okay so on this one let me get rid of my testing code for is mesh one the timer and so on okay and for the timer timer is not going to be that so the anime test let me grab it with a ref R so that I can actually write onto it okay so I've got that one good and so I'm going to go into the animate text animate test and let me grab the value r w grab the timer minus or plus equals go up time no not time uh system api. time. time okay so increase it by time and if this one if it is above the animation timer max if so then let's count it down so on this one uh minus equals the animation timer Max okay loop back the time and then modify the mesh so now here's when I have to do uh the tricky thing is that over here I have to do a switch go inside of that one go inside the value R just read in order to grab the animation type and then I do a case case I'm on Marine idle if I am on Marine idle then I basally want to get the next so I guess I can go on this one dot the current frame and I can do current frame Plus+ okay which I believe like this uh it should work okay so I grabb that one but now I need to know the frame Max okay so in frame Max uh so that one has two so then I have to set this one equals this one remainder of the frame Max no not that oh crap I I declared it over here now I got the int frame Max equals z let put a default on this one and put frame Max equals to okay so counting up the timer okay when goes past the maximum reset the timer okay then increase the next frame and then go back to that but now over here I need another switch so yeah I'm definitely going to need to rethink this code quite a lot cuz yeah I don't want to have tons of switches this definitely uh not looking very good but so over here I can do a switch on the uh animate test. Val R let's grab the current frame and case I'm on frame zero case I am on frame zero then over here I'm going to set this guy so I'm going to set that one and my test like grab for the Marine idle zero do that one do a break and K on one then I'm going to grab that one like that okay so I think like this it should work okay I think like this it should work so basically I'm grabbing all those I'm increasing the timer okay when it goes above I reset the timer I increase the current frame then I grab the remainder in order to make sure it never goes above and then I do a thing let me just do a default just to be safe and Visually goes onto that one or that one okay so I think like this it should work I can live with a white theme that is because the dark mode burns my eyes so the same way that I'm assuming like you are saying I'm assuming you are the kind of person who cannot live with white theme well I'm the same way just the other way around I cannot live with dark mode all right so let's put both of those and that should trigger which should make this guy you all right good awesome so basally just spent a bunch of time in order to get the exact same result so the same character is inating okay good but now that I done that now I can basically continue doing the exact same thing oh but yeah I'm really going to need to refactor this code otherwise it's going to be a huge mess because yeah then I've got to do a switch on the animate test let's grab the value Aro let's grab the current frame and do a default do a k zero and case it is on zero then I have to go into that one and over here grab the Marine walk zero case one two and three then pick up that one two and three and three three and two and one and then up here on this one so this one has four animations so if I go in the Marine won this one has four frames all right awesome that's cool um someone asking if we're going to release total World Liberation that is my goal is to get back to that game on the second half of this year so I don't know around September October that's kind of my goal around that time go back into that game cuz I really enjoy it I really uh I still love the idea behind that game I definitely it is something that I want to do so yeah right now the goal the plan is to get back to it on the second half this year and hopefully it should be fun so hopefully I don't know maybe by this time next year no I think that's a bit too early I was going to say by this time next year maybe it won't be out but if I start but if I get back to it in September probably not going to be done by May so maybe by like I don't know June August of next year maybe something like that it might be out so that could be that could be fun okay let me just I just need to expose the other thing so on this one up here let me make a public animate test. animation type animation type and then I just got to oh yeah B that one with that one with the authoring the animation type okay uh where was I sorry so many so many comments that I'm trying to oh the new member hey thank you so much sved uh ACV pet D okay yeah thank you so much uh sorry I'm trying to trying to do work whilst trying to read questions at the same time is a little bit tricky and did my did the unit just vanish or did my yeah I'm just the other way around okay so let me just a quick test so if I go there I swap that one into Marine walk and now nice all right it does seem to work so there you go that's the won animation which I believe it is working correctly yeah it's a very janky walk animation so I definitely need to make it a little bit faster just to make it look a little bit better but yeah the logic does work so let me try making it just a little bit faster so maybe just two so maybe just run at uh five frames per second and it should look a little bit nice but yeah yeah it's always awesome to write brand new code and see how everything works it's changing the legs right yes it is it just looks a bit oddd since it's all in but yeah it is using left right left right so yeah does work there you go some nice dots animation and if I just well actually if I swap this one it won't change but can I modify it over here okay modify it into the idle there you go on the idle animation nice see here's a nice uh animation system so by swapping out this enum all of a sudden it is going between that one okay so now that the is too fast yeah it is Jing from that one and that one okay uh what are the specs of your PC that's a good question uh I don't know cuz it's been a long time since I've bought it uh it's the I don't know it's an AMD CPU sorry I don't remember it's been like this PC is like 5 years old still awesome though so yeah it's uh it's the and the graphics card is a 3080 I think so that one is pretty good that one was 3080 or 2080 I know but the graphics the graphics card was very expensive at times so that was definitely quite tricky um did you use OBS for streaming live yep I'm using OBS right now it is really awesome it gets the camera input it gets the the uh the uh screen view so yep I use OBS both for both for uh recording and for doing live stream so that's really awesome uh sorry to ask again if vertex animation textures are good is it somewh to if it's only animation performance I'm not sure what you mean by that I mean vertex animations do you mean for skin mesh renders because if you use a skin mesh render you are still going to use Game objects and if you use game objects you are still going to have some limitations as to um as to how many units you can have on screen so if you are rendering a a you got a 390 yeah I think that's right how do you know better than me I don't know but yeah thank you yeah I think I do have a 39 I I get confused um so yeah basically if you use vertex animations with textures it w be very fast for the animation but if the whole thing is still based on game objects you are still going to have some limitations there not as much as if you were using normal skin mesh renders but you are still going to have some limitations for using Game objects as opposed to doing everything dot space so if you want to push the unit amount to the absolute Max then yeah it does help for everything to be based on based on uh dots can ask if it's possible to use your utils in published games and also if there's any existing videos on utils yep definitely go ahead and use the utilities or any code in any of my tutorials in your own in your own games free or commercial doesn't matter I hope I hope they help you a lot and uh yeah I don't have anything that is too uh explanatory on it but the utilities they do have quite a lot of uh comments on the various uh classes so if you just explore all those functions hopefully they should be well named so that you can easily understand what they're all doing sorry so many questions I'm I'm trying to keep up uh does that support Unity visual scripting I mean visual scripting can can work with any kind of code you can you can use visual scripting interact with any kind of C class so in that way you can kind of do it but uh visual scripting is very much based on objects so I'm not sure you can I'm not sure you can do much uh visual scripting plus entities by itself but you could definitely have some in between C Class where the visual scripting interacts with that C class which in turn interacts with ECS worldl so that can work quite uh that can be one option but at that time if you're doing that might as well just be better just to use code by itself so I'm not too sure okay so let me just uh let me try to apply this animation system to all of my characters so if I grab one of my unit so let me remember what do I need to to make this work and I'm pretty sure that all I need is just a mesh filter a mesh render and this component okay so actually if I copy this component okay now I'm trying to think cuz on on this one if I go inside my unit inside my unit I've got a capsule okay let me make just a well let me actually just duplicate the capsule animated mesh and on this one let me just attach the component is this it if I do this will this work that's a good question I don't know let me so on the capsule let me modify this let me put a a cube just make sure that it's not Runing the capsule okay so it's running Cube but this Cube should then swap out and let's see and yeah it does work all right awesome so obviously need uh a bunch of things but yeah the logic does work okay so let me uh let me see how much do I it weighs oh no it's the animated mesh that I moved it upwards okay so I got to move it well not move it down I got to put it on 0 0 okay so let me just oh did I move this one did this apply an override oh it did oh that's interesting okay move it back okay good let me go inside the prefab open the prefab and on this one let's put it on zero and let me actually put the other mesh so the Marine idle and all I'm missing is just the material so let me go ahead and grab the material so just copy this material go onto that one onto the go inside the prefab and on the animated mesh and paste of material and let's put it like this and there you go now all of them have that and all of them are walking and all of them are still units so everything still work okay so I got to I got to play around with the orientation and yeah then I just have to modify that that enum to make it work but yeah for the most part yeah animations are roughly working so that's awesome that is cool okay uh a weird question but did you share a computer with someone when you were young uh technically yes I mean back when I was very young when I was like 10 years old I had a brother and we only had one computer so I guess so although my brother was more outgoing so I had a lot of time just in the computer by myself and then later on we had two computers so yeah I guess I guess in the beginning we had uh a little bit but how do you do the unit selection in dots the answer is actually initially I I started doing a physics query in order to do a uh a uh what do you call it a box cast a overlap box on the world but then I figured out that there's actually one interesting thing so oh and I didn't notice a new member cute so thanks again ACV petd uh thanks so much and you member the qua yeah thanks so much uh uh what was I saying oh right so initially I was using actually doing a box CEST so as I was moving this if you saw the first live stream that I did on this project you will have seen that so as I was doing the selection it was actually uh placing and moving a a cube directly inside the 3D scene but if the camera is slightly rotated then that doesn't actually work cuz if I was making a cube from here to here it would actually be kind of like this at an angle and would not actually uh hit the positions as it should be so basically for the in selection I have to basically just do this little square all of this is handled on the UI itself and then for the logic so on the uh what did I call it the unit selection manager not this one the unit selection manager okay so basically on this one so I've got basically I get the mouse down Mouse up and I get the mouse screen position that is the important thing it is the screen position not the world position and then basically I calculate a rectangle so using the screen lower left corner and the upper right corner in order to calculate the the selection rectangle and then I instead of doing a physics query instead of that uh where is it that's the movement and for the selection uh where's the right here it is so for selecting multiple units basically I find the units that have a friendly component so this is actually one thing that I still probably have to figure out some optimization cuz over here it is basically just going through all the units that can be selected and then simply does a world to screen point so basically converts their world coordinates into screen coordinates and then checks if those screen coordinates are within that selection rectangle and if so then select this unit and if not then don't select it so yeah that is one one example of something that I started off with an interesting approach then realize that approach did not work and then have to come up with something different so yep that is how it works right now so make a a square and yep I can select all the units and all of those that are inside the Square get selected and ones outside do not so yep that was an an interesting thing that took a bunch of iterations in order to make it work but now it is working quite well physics s is so bad I Implement my own kd3 and end up being a thousand times faster isn't I haven't done any any uh uh performance tests so yeah I'm curious to see I'm curious to take this uh uh when this project is done I'm very curious to just grab the number of units multiply it by 100 and see does it work with like a th000 a th000 uh units or not so I'm very very curious to see that why un do showing some errors I don't know that depends on what kind of Errors you're getting like over here I'm not getting any errors so everyone depends on what you're having can you check mxm package on the NT accessory and tell me is this possible without that package I'm not sure what mxm means so I don't know what is mxm motion matching is that what you mean if you're asking does unity support motion motion matching by default it doesn't uh so yeah if you're looking for that then there are a bunch of uh assets on the store that can be quite uh quite helpful for that top five books I much must read to improve my programming skills like the main one that I've recommend many many times many many times is code complete to I highly recommend this book it is really big really thick let me pick it up it's a super thick book but it does oh there you go so yeah super thick book about 800 pages long a lot of a lot of code a lot of text a lot of stuff so it does take quite a while to get through it but if you do get through it your skills as a programmer are going to improve 10 fold so yeah super thick definitely going to take you a while to get through but I highly highly recommend this book I definitely uh attribute to this book the most of the skills that I have in terms of specifically writing good clean code so yeah I high recommend if you want to improve your own programming skills definitely look into this book I can highly recommend it by the way I'm not sponsored I just love that book it has helped me a lot so I will definitely always uh point out that book because does help but are going to leave to GD later uh I would love to try out gdau at some point but leave not really I mean I've got my I don't know 12 years uh with unity at this point so that is quite a lot of uh experience gain I mean you always gain quite a lot of knowledge extra knowledge by sticking with one tool for a long time as opposed to jump just jumping back and forth so yeah I definitely would love to try out K do but no not going to not really going to switch uh thing code complete versus clean code are they both useful or is the just code complete is uh clean code is also good I also remember that I enjoyed not as much but uh I found that clean code was a bit uh a bit less in that a bit smaller so if you want something to read a bit faster then yeah I guess that one could be good cuz you can get through that one much quicker than you can get through this one so yeah both are really good uh on an infinite enough timeline I would definitely encourage you to read both of them but yeah if you can only pick one I would pick code complete but yeah clean code is also really good it's uh a bit smaller so you can get through it a little bit easier which can also can also help can also be nice uh is there a good beginner tutorial for Dots apparently many tutorials are out of date I would point you to my tutorial that I made like uh two months ago and is still very much up to date I mean I rewatched my own tutorial to to to get back into the mindset of dots to to focus on uh regaining the skills in order to be able to uh make this project so yep definitely go look at that video it's pretty long it's an hour and a half so it does cover quite a lot of things and Y pretty much all of it is still up to date so this one over here I was using version 1.0 whereas now there's version 1.2 there are a few different things but for the most part they're very much very much a same thing this code complete have a lot of fillers is it filled with fluff or does it jump in nope it just jumps in right away so there's really no fluff there's it's a very very technical book it is very much not a book to read for uh enjoyment I guess it is something to read just for Learning and yeah it definitely so yeah no filler just all excellent content excellent information all right so let me just try handling the uh the rotation cuz I actually don't know exactly how I can handle the rotation so I assume that it's going to be on the local transform yeah cuz over here I'm setting the rotation to the identity but quaternion are always tricky how do I get the is it LO rotation okay maybe with Lo rotation it might work take a forward and an up does flow three have it doesn't so I need to do a new flow three for the up so up will be 0 one 0 set the up and then the move there this will be the forward okay so let's see if just like this if it does work let's try it out prop theill link to Amazon I don't I don't have an aill link for Amazon sorry so yeah just go ahead and and pick it up uh it's definitely really awesome so yeah I think this is yeah this is amazon.com so yeah if you you want to pick it up I really highly encourage you it definitely keep in mind it's a thick thick book so like 800 pages so it takes a while but yeah definitely if you manage to go through it and you understand it it will definitely level up your skills 10x so yeah that is that's what happened to me so that is why I H recommend I read this book when I was in the is there an error sometimes dots has some strange errors but then it clicks uh oh boy there you go what happened okay assertion failed distance Force sword what the what in the world okay I have no idea okay so apparently I can't do this why can't I do a look rotation what does this okay let me try doing a debug. log on this one try to see what this one says over here qu that identity okay let's see what this one is going to say how to buy that book in India I don't know doesn't Amazon have an Indian P oh Nan why is it nan oh maybe it's zero is it zero uh why on Earth is the cuz I'm guessing look rotation actually has the rotation all debugging with debug on log yep debug on log doing all kinds of logs it is also really awesome okay so that's the oh right because they're uh static by default all right um okay so yeah I didn't know that I had to make a if okay so sure fine I guess so if oh yeah right and I also have to this is going to move quickly so then I have to do an alert but anyways so if move de equals float 3.0 if so then let's set this one into qu. identity okay and if not wait can't I do an equals on that if not then do that can't I do an equal on that a bone three what on Earth is a bone three okay that's the first time that I'm seeing this what on Earth is a b three oh does it compare all three of them well that's interesting and look at that I just learned something new apparently there is something called a bullion 3 which I'm guessing it is going to compare x with X and set that one to True y to Y set that one to true and oh that is interesting I mean it's it's not what I want but yeah that is interesting so how do I can't I get just a bullion out of this or no boy this is a giant class okay huh you have to compare with equals yeah I guess so I'm guessing there has to be a better way of doing that uh can I do this one. equals will this one yeah I guess this one will test that one be I had no idea there was such a thing as a bowling three so I'm guessing this one is going to yeah test the X Y and Z yeah look at that that is fun so there is such a thing as a bulling 3 who knew I wonder where that is useful I guess it just I guess if you want to do comparisons basically it's easier to compare all three values and set all three values as opposed to just one by oh anyways okay so so that is fun well our flat for equal yeah basically just testing each of them by themselves so yeah it must be very optimized for all kinds of things but okay look that it works and now the unit yeah I still need to still need to make the uh still need to do the one on that try math. all oh does that exist look at that yeah I still have to handle the stopping logic because they're basically just jumping back and forth between but yeah the logic works I go up here I click there and there you go he does rotate like that and does rotate on that side and on that side and that side nice all right that's cool that works see it's always awesome when something like that works so let's see the m ma. all okay so this one is going to do a bullion and yeah it's going to return that one and that one and so on and it's all massively in line so now I wonder which one is faster is it doing the equals getting the B three and then doing equals or just the equals I'm guessing this equal is going to be fast but yeah it's a there are so many so many math functions that I have no idea how how it works it's actually quite fun have two dogs what are the names so the brown one his name is Tik and her name is Tekk and they're both asleep right now I gotta get a a second camera would be nice to have like a dog camera because they're right over there so it would be nice to have a camera here pointing there would be fun so yeah I got to got to pick up a second camera because that would be would be fun okay all right so yeah so this is working but it has two problems so the first problem is that they get there and they don't stop and can I actually well I guess I can modify it over do I test here that's a good question I guess I can check if this one do magnitude oh it does not have a magnitude okay I thought it didn't does have a size nope huh so Flo three doesn't have magnitude doesn't have size nope just has a ton of XY oh I think it's on math I keep forgetting oh does it have length nope apparently not but yeah I do think that math. magnitude our size length Okay math does have length uh length of the move there so float reach Target distance let's say .5 units that should be fine enough so if that one is to far if so then move closer and if not then do something but always put the angular velocity on zero because I don't want brilliant CH plugin yeah asking questions in Live Chat is actually uh super for uh useful okay so get the move Direction and if it gets if it is still too far then move closer if it is not then let me just set this one into no not here this one into a float 3.0 so basically it stops moving and stops rotating okay so actually I think like this it should stop and no longer do all of this uh crazy thing let's let's try it on and see you have TRS in six with baking uh not really I haven't had any issues so I don't know what uh problems here referring to but yeah it's um okay go there nice okay so now I just need to modify the the thing and it should and it should work but yeah I can select my units move around and they rotate correctly so just need to swap the animations but y they go on all over the place now just need to animate it and soon as they get there they no longer constantly jump back and forth they get there and stop oh math. up does that exist CU I tried looking at Flo 3. up and it did not exist math do up okay there you go it does work oh this is a function that's a bit confusing I got to say one thing that I dislike is how the math Library over here this one does not follow the normal rules like why is the class name lowercase why is this one lowercase but apparently it's a function so that is one thing that drives me crazy but from what I understood I believe they did it because all of the other uh ECS based math libraries of those super fast math libraries they were based on they basally use this uh naming rules but so I can understand why they chose it but I still dis like it still looks very strange but anyways so yeah I'm guessing this one does return um a crap and I also I still haven't figured out why it is that sometimes Vision Studio opens up everything in Gray and doesn't seem to recognize anything and sometimes does work anyways but yep it does do exactly that return new floats 0 one0 all right nice looks like Doom worthy character uh didn't have an idol an mission was using walking said oh is that is that the case do Doom characters not have Idol I guess they're always patrolling around so that's nice I didn't I didn't uh never thought about that but yeah I guess they they move constantly so yeah Library written on Java rules yeah I'm not sure where the rules Come From but yeah it is basically I read once that they made it so that it fits with other other libraries that already exist and where super high performance andely fit that naming scheme as opposed to continuing to use the unity naming scheme so that is a bit strange uh do you know you can iterate faster if you install the hot reload asset I have heard of that asset and does look really awesome but I haven't yet uh haven't yet seen it so haven't yet used it myself but but yeah it does it does uh from what I saw on the assur page it does work quite well although especially with dots like I click and basically just starts right away and when I modify something it recompiles in one or two seconds so don't really necessarily need that much uh much faster have you gotten into making editor tools I did make a few I mean when I made the uh the uh the companion project for my C course for that one I made an entire editor tool so yeah thanks so much the qua yeah a bunch of new members on this live stream that was fun uh so I made the um the editor TOS for the cop course yep I use the uh UI toolkit to make a bunch of editor tools and it actually did work quite well so it worked surprisingly well so that was uh quite fun so uh thanks for your free course nice I'm beginning the intermediate tutorial and I'm loving it oh that is awesome that is cool I hope you I hope you learn a lot from it oh or was it how to give audio in unity dots that is a good question I haven't yet researched that so so yeah I'm curious to see that myself because yep I haven't yet researched it so I'm not entirely sure and actually let me just quickly add the animations and adding the animations should be rather simple I just need a ref RW what did I call it the animation test okay I still need to still need to refactor the name on that one but basically I just need the anime test I just need to get that one and basically uh too far so I want to move closer so if I'm on this one then I go into that one Val RW animation type and let me put Marine walk which of course then I'm going to have to refactor that so uh close enough stop moving so on this one let's go into Marine idle okay and just like this it should actually be should actually be working sou Brazil hey thanks for being here what time is it in Brazil it's like minus 8 hours I guess so it's like 10 a.m. there right now nice um one thing I disliked about ECS workflow is that it's slower compared to op and components you have to write to many logic do the same things but performance is unmatched of course yep I definitely do find it that it has quite a bit more plate code quite a few more things okay I just broke something out oh right cuz I put it on the other one so I got to I got to fix the query um so yeah I do find that it has quite a bit more uh quite a bit more uh boiler plate so it does take quite a lot more code so yeah that is why the uh recommended uh thing the recommended process is a hybrid workflow so basically use game objects for the things where a game object makes sense and use ODS for the things when you need absolute massive performance so yeah it's uh it's basically a very good thing that Unity kind of walked back on their initial goal which was make uh either full game object or full dots it's nice that over time they realize that the best uh workflow of all is just makes them use one or the other depending on when it is uh necessary so yeah that actually is quite nice uh yeah I was talking about two where's my oh there it is Yeah so basically for the all of the various things that I did for the for my for the companion project on my C course for all of this for the election list all the things for all the uh exercises the quizzes and so on so let me select one like for example select the one on variables going on the fq so all of these editor Windows these are basically custom tools Custom Custom editor Windows uh uh so yeah I basically built all of this so how can you modify the value of a variable by assigning a new value by using the modify keyword or by Red declaring and the answer is by assigning a new value to the variable and so on so basically all this was made using UI tokit actually if you have the companion project and you want to inspect if you want you can go over here inside of this folder then you can go inside the editor folder and over here you can see the various UI toet like for example let's say the one on the frequently asked questions because this one is nice and simple just double click and up pops out the UI Builder so here it is basically how the home thing works in the UI Builder so this is the same thing as this one over here so the UI Builder if you haven't used it yet for making editor tools it is surprisingly easy it only took me a I don't know a couple of hours watching some tutorial videos in order to figure out how to make it work but yeah UI Builder is actually surprisingly easy to work and then writing the code to run all these things um it is also surprisingly easy it does have one thing that I dislike which is how uh it's based on strings so like for example here I am creating the window okay sure then creating the [ __ ] and basically just got to do a bunch of queries so you can query on all kinds of types like an object field visual element and so on but then here's the part that I dislike about UI to Kit is how it has strings for doing queries so that is a little bit annoying but other than that UI toolkit is really awesome and surprisingly easy for making all kinds of uh editor tools so so yeah that is what I what I've used and it's actually quite nice and just recently I actually uh added this little window chat with AI so basically this one is connected to the uh bot that is trained on the contents of the course so you can basically uh chat with something and this one is actually on the back end the the AI chat bot is using open AI so I recently upgraded it to the uh new version so GPT 40 it's actually quite fun so if I ask what is the difference between delegates and events which is actually a question that a lot of people have asked me many times a lot of people have this confusion between where Del gets and the vents I can basically ask the question and then after a while it Returns the question and this one I'm guessing it's writing a ton of stuff that is why it's they use open AI library to make the bot uh not really I'm not sure if they have a C library so no I just use uh normal uh basically this goes onto my website and my website does a uh a current request on the open AI thing and then returns back and returns so on so basically this one this window over here is interacting with my website my website is interacting with the open Ai and then so on it goes kind of like that so yeah difference between them so delegat definition delegate is the type that defines a method signature y that is correct so here is an example public delegate attack delegate yep that is exactly correct and then for events does all kinds of things so yeah so yeah the bot on uh GPT 40 is actually surprisingly uh surprisingly good and quite fast so that is actually uh quite nice see Youtubers with chat walking on screen how do you achieve this effect I have a bunch of tutorials on the bottom of this page if you want to see so go on to that page down here so basically the characters down here this is a transparent Unity window the way they are being animated these are mesh based animations and then the way that it is interacting with the YouTube API is through an HTTP request from unity and the randomization on all these characters is basic the same way that I handle the get spreadsheets in my game battle R kind of like that this response would take like one second on llama 3 uh I guess that is going to are you talking about on device because that is going to depend on the device of the person and on this one the main thing that it uh the main thing that over here on the on the uh on this window that takes a while is because basically uh I didn't Implement uh streaming so basically it just waits for the entire response to be generated before it does so when it's a long uh when it's a long uh response like this one then yeah does take a few seconds but if it is something short then yeah it takes like one two seconds and it actually goes quite well and uh yeah uh oh uh does that mean we have to input our own API token nope this one is using my my website API token and and no it's not really rate limited I mean I'm assuming that the people who pick up the C course they're actively trying to learn as opposed to trying to abuse the system so maybe maybe I'm a bit naive but so far there haven't been problems with that so if you have the uh the premium version of the course go ahead ask whatever questions you want and yeah it shouldn't be R limited hopefully um okay let me just uh try to sort this out which is actually going to be an interesting question uh like I was saying sometimes when it comes to dots you've got to think about various things that you can do so basically the issue over here is that query is no longer working so I can no longer move and and uh it's not this one no this is the other one uh and basically the issue is because I added the anime test but hey good evening hey uh basically the issue is that I added that one to the query but for the visual I added it to a child object ah so now here's another question how do I reference this in terms of handling references that is something that I still haven't yet figured out the best way to do it I think the best way is really this one has a unit authoring but this one has but all the other ones are actually going to have animation right well I guess I could make a I guess I could make a yeah I guess that's what makes sense so okay so let's go let's make an animated mesh authoring so I Mak an animated mesh authoring components okay and then I'm going to have a public uh animated mesh a class not a Class A struct and this one is going to be I component data okay and now on this one I'm going to have a public entity for animated mesh entity and that is the one that is going to have that component for that thing so over here a public game object for animated mesh game object all right and then I've got a public class I'm going to have a class A Baker class Baker of animated mesh authoring okay and then on this one so I'm basically going to entity equals get this entity and this one is going to be transform. dynamic okay and then I need to add the component and adding the component on this entity new animated mesh and inside that animated mesh inside for the animated mesh entity get the entity and the entity that I want is the authoring do animated mesh game object and it's going to be dynamic okay so y like this so basically I have this one this one has a reference to the other one so now if I attach this component to that one it should hopefully work you prefer Visual Studio over wrer uh not necess pref uh uh any preference just it's what a misu it's what I've used and I don't really have any uh any kind of thing against it and it made mes That's What I Call uh so yeah basically have no reason to switch but from what I've heard uh ryer is indeed awesome so yeah if you like using that then definitely go ahead and use that okay so that one has a reference to that one so now over here on the unit mover system instead of looking for that component I can look for this component for the animated mesh so this one animated mesh but now yep that's the thing so now I need to go system API to get the component of type animated uh animate test I still have to refactor that code to rename it get that one on the entity that is the entity on animated mesh value R yeah I'm not going to modify this one so let's make this one a ref r o r o ref so I inside that one and I get the animate mesh entity okay so this Returns the animate test wait does this okay now I'm trying to see because there is another yeah there is a get component RW so what does this return does yep so returns a ref RW animate test animate test okay awesome so now I go into that one and I do that let me actually put this one up there so I go into that one I do that and then I go into that one I do that all right nice so this should hopefully be working so let's see let's see if it works uh let's see okay they are idle and they are moving nice okay so all that All That Remains is having different uh animation speeds so like the walking that one needs to be like a fast animation but the idle is not meant to be that fast but y so I tell them to move they run and they get there oh those are five because they are still oh because they are still pushing each other so I still have to uh reorganize that code to make it work in a different way so that they get to a point oh look at that need shooting not shooting for the weapon so I still need to figure that out but yeah uh remember tool is as limiting as your knowledge yep definitely IDs are just tools uh rer is an awesome ID from what I've heard but just using an awesome ID isn't necess going to make you better it's really just a tool so whatever you use WR Visual Studio Visual Studio code whatever you do it uh what matters is really your own skills so yeah you're a student you can get all jet brings products for free oh is that true that is nice that is awesome I did not know that that is cool I mean I'm using the um the uh uh uh yeah Visual Studio has the community version that is always free so that is the one that I normally encourage people to use so visual City Community is free but yeah wrer ID that as a free day Tri and yeah on education I'm guessing they have real licenses for students and teachers so yeah that is nice for individual use and so on so yeah I mean like I said I've Heard lots of great things about it so yeah if you are if you want to try out a different ID then definitely give r a try and see see if you'll like it all right so yeah so logic is indeed working so I've got some dots entities they are animated they are walking around it's kind of funny how as soon as you add some uh some entities all of a sudden it looks quite a lot better so that's nice uh yeah the units are moving a bit too slow but yeah let's attack that one boom boom nice oh I got to move move the the health bar a little bit up and why is that one not looking at the camera it should be oh CU I didn't oh that is going to be a tricky thing okay I'm going to have to figure that one out cuz yeah the health bar is looking at the camera but due to how dots works it does not handle the global rotation only the local one so that is why when it moves to the side the health bar is no long oh okay so I'm going to have to have to figure that out oh Jason Sorry's here oh is he oh hey Jason hey how's it going can I go back since I started using it too many quality of life features yep yep that's exactly what I've heard from from yourself and many others from the from the uh Game Dev show many people talking about the benefits of of rers so yeah yeah I heard you were talking about a uh working on a new video so looking forward to it yeah a launer that it sound interesting when you talked about on the game da show so yeah I'm looking forward to uh the new video little launcher yeah the way that Jason mentioned in the the live stream how basically you have a bunch of hotkeys so you don't have any icons any kind of thing I got to say that does in theory it does appeal to me cuz my my desktop does get full with tons of tons of uh icons even though I try to make it as uh simple as possible after a while it just ends up with tons of mess so yeah uh learning how to use something with just shortcut just things that actually sounds really awesome how is Tikko doing well both of them are asleep right now although they will probably wake up in a little bit because it's already 600 p.m. so in a little bit they will wake up and will be hungry so yeah just a little bit more uh where was I uh I was also doing some work on an idea for grids in unity video rewatch your older grid videos for inspiration that's nice awesome yeah I got to say grid system is something that is always always useful I've used grid systems in so many things and it's a something that is also although there is one thing about the it's not the grid system it's the mouse position something that you mentioned on one of the live streams on how you can apparently use the plane class cuz like for my mouse script I'm using a ray cast in order to find the position and I think you mentioned how you can use the uh Unity plane thing in order to get the intersection I heard you mention it but I'm not entirely sure on how it is how do you get the I guess that's it I guess you do a rast on a plane out float enter so it's not the oh it's a distance okay so I guess you take a ray cast from the camera's position you do a rast this return the distance and then you go inside the uh isn't there a get position get distance to point or no get side when do you get the is it translate okay now I'm not sure because I assumed they would have a get position some kind of thing but to cover the rare topics like compressing a large sparse grid when run left encoding using TRS matrixes to do recasting checks against without needing colliders wow that sounds like a very complex thing yeah uh you don't even need the pl class I use that as an example yeah I guess you can just use uh some math in order to figure out I mean you've got a ray you want to see if it hits there where exactly does it hit then yeah I guess you you can just use some basic math and it oh crap why is my phone suspected spam well that's not nice anyway anyways um uh so yeah ray. get Point okay that's what I was looking for yeah so the ray Returns the Ray has a uh yeah exactly it has a get point where you pass in distance and returns this and that so yeah so yeah I guess instead of doing rast you can just do a plane in order to that so it should be fun till now do you think I can use nt6 preview based on your experience in using it and I want to work on Android with it because it has a lot of improve improvements for Android it all depends on how far long you are from the release if your game is coming out in like one or two months then use the 22 LTS oh that one now no longer works because it doesn't have the mesh um so if your game is coming out very soon then stick with the 22 LTS but if you are at least like six months away from release then definitely yeah go ahead and upgrade to Unity 6 because I mean at least from my research right now it has been very stable it hasn't crashed once it hasn't had any issues so it has actually worked uh quite well uh I just got to know your channel oh nice want to know if you have a tutorial about design patterns in unity uh not necessarily although I do have a a lecture on it in my uh C course I don't remember if it's on the I think it's on the intermediate one on the why isn't this fing see now YouTube search is so strange okay okay so if I put C enter it doesn't show up C intermediate it does show up okay anyways so yeah sometimes YouTube search is very strange but anyways yeah so here I have a rough uh thing where I talk about some design patterns in general and one on the Singleton patterns so I guess uh let me skip this ah crap the ads I'm used to having a premium when I'm logged in but over here I'm not logged in so yeah uh so if you want to learn then hopefully this lecture should help uh point you in the right direction okay so let me just uh okay let me just oh there are some units that are yeah this something that I still have to figure out look at that uh that is the issue is that when they go idle they're all constantly still trying to go to the same point so I got to uh add some stopping logic so that they stop moving otherwise they move on top of one another see if I try putting all of them oh yeah I can disable this one because I no longer needed they all go they all go into one place and it all gets messed up they get on top of each other because they're all trying to go to the same point so it's all it's all messed up yeah they're definitely fighting each other quite a bit uh oh speaking of course just want to say I 100% recommend Cod M SC oh thanks Jason that's nice all on I can so I know what to recommend I think you me G course is by far my favorite unit oh nice yeah thank you um uh okay let me just apply the uh visual to that gu right there and get rid of this one because I longer need uh this one over here now this animate test so the test was successful so just okay so let me remember what do I need in order to make it work yeah I should probably use some uh base prefabs instead of trying to do it like this but for now let's put it like this so let's go inside the unit prefab and inside this one let's paste that one which okay paste on the wrong place but okay and this one is actually going oh right because I wanted to yeah this is the thing that I'm going to have to figure out how am I going to change this okay now I'm trying to trying to remember where did I yeah cuz that is not the was that no that wasn't the okay I'm trying to trying to think uh CU I've got this an I'm trying to think what is the how do I find the material that I was using that one is white nope it's not that one it's not that one oh well I mean I guess I have one of the various ones down here no that's not the Scout is that the Scout nope that's not the Scout is that the Scout that is the Scout okay so what is the material that I was using on this one material uh this one special forces okay good let me just copy that one and then go inside the unit fast and on this one let me put that material and okay now it looks good all right great so but yeah I'm definitely going to have to uh rework how am I going to have this animated mesh CU I think like this it is going to be quite tricky but if I open this one and I paste this one like that uh the animated mesh just pass in that reference and just like this this one should be working although it won't be working like that huh so this is the part that I'm going to have to stop and think long and hard for a long time until I figure out what is the best course of action for this let me just hide these that one and that one there's some one more this one oh crap cuz I can't see it behind the characters uh why is there there are two characters why are there two characters here okay why is this okay I'm not sure where this character is coming from CU sometimes if you create an entity that only exists as an entity it doesn't select anything on the hierarchy so if I click on that one it doesn't select anything here so is that an let me unload and reload okay it vanished so it was a zombie entity that stayed behind and did something okay anyways so yeah so that one should be working but yeah ex it's going to be using S down which is a different mesh so H yeah ghost object very spooky oh hey Phil it's you oh hey how's it going uh right so basically is this the best course of action basically just having a component and that component contains all the references to all the meshes and all the animations on the one hand I don't like it but on the other hand I can't think of a better way to do it because again on on dots you don't really have lists of things so and I don't think using a dynamic buffer would be best I mean technically a bch mesh ID this one is really tiny so I don't think it would be an issue if I've got like 100 of these it's literally just a u in value So in theory it would not necessarily be a terrible thing if I had 100 of these although I guess one thing that I haven't yet uh is the shared components I haven't seen those in quite a while shared components so maybe that's it maybe I do a would this be the case for blob B data can a blob asset data have I haven't looked into blob assets much yet so I'm not entirely sure but a so a blob asset creates a so basically you can create a blob bass and then have a reference to that blob B but I think that would kind of end up being the same thing although maybe a little bit more that is part of why I'm squirly on dots friction is a productivity C and I don't want have to derail every time I have to learn how to solve existing problems yep that is I mean that is definitely an issue with trying something that is very new which is yeah if I was making an an uh if I was making an RTS game using normal game objects then yeah I would be I would be done with this prototype by now having to learn how to do many things new it does had quite a lot of friction quite a lot of things but at the same time the benefits are supposedly really awesome so I'm I'm hoping that when uh this game is done and working I'm hoping that it won't because it's based on dots it won't allow me to make different designs as opposed to what I could do just based on game object so it is it adds quite a bit more friction quite a bit more uh takes quite a while to build because I have to relearn how to do things but hopefully the bonuses at the end will be uh quite useful so yeah what use queries instead of empti jobs just because I'm still making the prototype so I haven't converted anything into jobs yet so everything is still just normal uh in queries but yep uh eventually when the when everything is working exactly as I wanted to then yep then I will go refactor all these systems in order to make them work with systems in order to in order to make them work with jobs to make them as performant as I can make them so uh but yeah so essentially uh yeah this one well let me just let me just do it manually right now and then I'll re Factor the code once I figure out a better way to do it but let me just try doing a so Scout Idol and W also has the same thing so let me do a scout idle zero and one and Scout walk 0 1 2 3 one two and three then up here same thing so a scout itle zero and one Scout W 0 1 2 3 so with with that it won't work but the uh let me make a bunch of them so basically going to have the idle zero ID one one to wait did I miss one uh yeah I'm missing the zero the W zero okay so I really dislike the fact that it has a huge amount of stuff but technically it might work cooking fitness channel when that would be fun I mean if I had infinite amount of time I would love to do a bunch more channels to have basically excuses to do all kinds of all kinds of interesting hobbies that would definitely be fun are you finding it so far it's been nice I'm CAU up with the series does give you insight to more lower level stuff I know learning completion made me understand Val types more uh it has I mean the main challenge has been figuring out what parts should be dots and what part should be normal game objects like in the beginning for the uh for the first iteration that I was using for handling the 11 selection I was using a DOT system and I was finding that was needlessly complex having to work with uh because I was also doing the ray cast in order to find the M position so I was having to mix the dots with the uh with the mono Behavior world and so on so that was being confusing until I simply made it a I don't know a rough rule a rough guideline okay things that involve tons of units like for example each individual unit for the moving shooting and so on okay that makes sense to be dot spased but for other things like the selection I mean the selection is only I'm only going to select units like once per second so it makes no sense for that one to be a dots thing so in the beginning I made a unit selection thing but then I just made a regular mono Behavior to handle the things so yeah that was the main thing that I've learned as I'm making this prototype is trying to get a better idea of what should be dots based what should be game objects based uh cuz yeah that is the that seems like the main main question for trying to build a project the correct way using a nice haard approach and yeah I've tried looking for Best Practices but yeah there's still not much around so yeah basically I'm going in blind trying to do all kinds of things trying to figure out what is the best way to do them and uh and yeah so it's been a nice Learning Journey but other than that by following that guideline things have been uh going quite well so I'm quite enjoying it it's been quite fun okay let me just that's the Scout idle zero Scout idle one then the walk zero the walk one the walk two and the walk Three then I'm going to need the different uh over here so got Marine walk got the Scout idle and the Scout wonk but now this is going to be the big issue right yep that is going to be the big issue CU I need an animation type and an animation divis idual so this is why it's going to be or not okay okay so I think I just figured out how I might make this work so so this one is actually the same so the Scout I also has two frames and Scout walk also has four frames uh okay but yeah all of this has to be different so this is the part that is definitely quite annoying quite tricky a lot of copy paste code so I really got to figure out a better way to do this but uh so the Scout idle zero the Scout idle one and then I've got the Scout walk zero walk one walk two and walk Three ah Scout walk three and Scout W to okay so that one it should be working but now I need to figure out when it's say Scout and when it is not a scout and I think that I already have that on the unit so so if I go on the uh where do I want to go on the unit mover yeah because I'm pretty sure the enemies also have the units so if I do a ref R of type unit I'm pretty sure on that one so ref R of type unit for the unit and if I grab that unit I'm pretty sure inside of it valo I do have a unit type okay nice so let me get an animate test. animation type uh idle animation type and got another one for the won animation type then I do a switch on this unit type that I have and by doing that uh Supply right now I've got soldiers and I've got the other one the other one is the fast okay so the first the idle equals uh that one. the scout Idol and the Scout W so that's the W and for this one for the idol equals this one the Marine idle and the Marine W and this is the W animation type okay so now over here instead of setting down one I set it to that one and instead of setting down one I set it to that one just need to make sure to add a default to make it work and okay all right so I think like this it should be work I'm L what problem you're solving I'm trying to solve the problem of having the animations be different for each unit type so right now that one was all was playing the same animation with different material but now I want them to play different animations so that one should play the Scout and this one should play the marine and right now it should be working no it's not okay why did that one vanish Into Thin Air I don't know uh where did that unit go okay uh okay let me go inside why did that one vanish cuz it is changing did I not register oh why are they all I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be all at zero pretty sure that means invalid so did the baker not run No it should have run okay now I'm trying to figure out why is this one not cuz that one is not registering the meshes did I not add the meshes I did okay I what didn't I did this not update did it reset something oh did I leave that one on ah crap okay that why cuz I left wait no no that is not why okay so I'm not entirely sure because I thought it was regenerating the animations but nope the Scout idle these animations are still here so that wasn't so apparently this one just lost the references for some inexplicable reason I'm not sure why but yep apparently this one just lost the reference okay so let's try dragging them again I have no idea why this one vanished but let's see if now that one go back outside do you have the references that one okay it does okay so let's see yay Works nice or does it work it does but did I put it the yeah I put it the wrong way around yeah so it does work but I put it the wrong way around so the idle is being the walking and then they are I don't so let me just swap that out but yep it did indeed work so uh so this one is not the idle this one is the wonk and this one is the idol all right awesome okay so I think it is I think it is working ah let's try it out and see okay so these are Idol and yep that one it is indeed working so that one is the uh idle uh Scout animation so this kind of that is a little pistol that one has a little AK and as I move y that one is playing the walk animation and as I move this one yep it is playing the Scout walk animation it's quite silly to have such low frame rate animations but I think it looks a little bit fun so yeah I don't know if I'm going to add more frames or leave it sort of like this very very uh sort like that but yeah it does wait and he's is he going to die no don't die a he killed my Scout that sucks oh man um yeah sorry I didn't I totally missed chat while I was reading that um B is fun but I find it impossible to work live at all yeah I gotta say I definitely right now I'm actually getting a bit better at that a bit better at being able to write some code do some work whilst being live on stream but yeah I remember the first few live streams that I did yeah I did I did feel inside a pretty intense sense of panic feeling a bunch of people watching me and I'm trying to write code and something doesn't work that was definitely very stressful but yeah as with so many things it is something you gain with experience and so far nowadays I can just focus a little bit better so yeah that does work uh quite a little bit are you selling all the meshes on a render mesh array uh I'm not manually but I think that by registering them they do uh register automatically does this oh that one was killed that's why it doesn't show up but yeah on that one so basically I'm I'm uh using this where is there it is so basically I'm going into default World getting the entities graphic system and then from that one calling it to register the mesh and I believe that is a similar method to setting it on the uh mesh array so basically it renders all the meshes and yeah over here on the yeah exactly or no no it does yeah it just this one doesn't have all has those but yeah I Believe by calling this function to um what is this this one to register the mesh I believe that one registers it over here on the render mesh array so yep it does that and then swapping out all the meshes and there you go here is some basic animation and it does work and I've got the animation for the different characters all right so now I got to figure out the animation for the for the zombies I got to figure out some kind of uh vision for that but yeah it is working so I've got uh this uh Marine uh unit right here so that one is working with the won and the idle animation and same thing for this one the won in the idle animation and yeah so he walks around gets there stops and does some idle thing nice all right cool uh you also prer light mode in your ID yep I can't really stand looking at uh dark mode at all if I do if I put this on dark mode I'm going to go blind within within a a few seconds so yep for me it has to be in light mode all the way uh but yeah I do know some people dislike that I wish I could I wish I could use light mode myself but then have like the viewer have some kind of dynamic thing on YouTube where you could switch if you wanted to see it in light mode or dark mode would be nice if such a thing existed but nope videos are fixed so if I if I record in light mode then you have to watch in light mode so sorry for those of you that prefer dark mode but yeah it has to be like that that's concept is kind of hard is isn't it requires a different level of thinking so it's a little bit harder it requires a bit more code to achieve the same thing but it is not necessarily insanely difficult just requires a different mindset but if you get a different mindset than getting it it does work actually relatively all right uh I just registered on Steamworks and chose 30% withhold tax so on top of the 30% seam cut I have to pay an additional 30% this this normal that depends on what country you're from because basically different count have uh I think it's called like double tribut laws something like that or not laws uh Accords deals something like that so basically Portugal and the US has one of those uh deals so yeah for me after submitting the correct forms they they put the withholding tax at 0% because Portugal in the US has a a deal like that so yeah basically you have to you have to figure out how to you have to figure out if your own country has something like that but yeah hopefully it does have I mean the US has deals with pretty much every country so yeah hopefully it won't take away 30% extra because yeah if they take away 60% that does become quite a bit trickier yeah uh you could have a blob asset which has an array of a struct which contains two array of mesh IDs oh nice these structs have the index of the unit type in oh nice yeah I definitely do have to research blob assets because I haven't looked into them much uh I know a rough idea of what they're used for and yeah I do guess for for this system they would make sense as opposed to having just a giant list of fields so yeah this definitely something that I will have to research because it might indeed be the perfect tool for exactly this and show us a h level of how you solve that again I mean for the basically for for the animations the animations are just swapping different meshes so since dots does not have any skin mesh render in order to handle the animations you can't just have a skin mesh render it won't actually I didn't test it but I'm pretty sure just putting a skin mesh render won't animate by default so yeah for handling the animation just swapping out the meshes and the way that it works is basically on the unit the unit has an authoring component which has a reference to all the meshes so here are all the meshes and then over here on this component it basically takes all those meshes goes inside the en's graphic system and registers the meshes this is required so that the entities's renderer knows what mesh to render because over here this one this type batch mesh ID this one is really just a number it doesn't actually store the mesh itself so basically it registers the mesh and doing so it matches a certain mesh object with a certain U value so it matches those things together then you save just that U value and then for modifying the mesh it's over here on this system that I have over here which is this thing the material mesh info this is something from the uh Unity dots rendering and then just over here doing some simple Logic for counting down the animation uh range then counting up the frames then depending on what animation is selected as either two frames or four frames in this case and then just looping back in order to make sure to not go over to some invalid frames and then for swapping mesh just as this goes inside the material mesh info grabs the value R order right wres the mesh ID with what is on the batch mesh ID and that basically swaps out the mesh so basically that's how it works register the mesh swap out the meshes and it has some interesting mesh animation so yeah uh look up material property overrides you won't work for the mesh index but it lets you set per instance shade of values in burst code have to do is set component oh interesting I did uh remember using material property overrides like a real long time ago when I was uh first getting into thatt and that was the the way to do it but I haven't looked at it right now so I'll have to see that cuz yeah I mean eventually the goal is to convert this so first of all I'm just trying to get it working and then after I have it working then I won't want to update this into into some uh into jifi code and yeah at that point I guess I will look into all those options using a material property using a blob asset and maybe with that it should work so we can't use normal 3D models and dots and animated not right now not by default by default dots right now does not have any animation tool set so you either have to build your own kind of like I'm doing here or you can go inside the uh asset sore and there's a bunch of of dots animation systems these are all based on using shaders that modify the vertices so yeah you can either use this or build your own which is kind of what I'm doing here why don't you create mobile games just because I don't normally play mobile games that is roughly the idea I mean mobile is a complete different world from PC steam in order to make good games you have to actually play the games that you want to make so for me since I don't normally play mobile games yeah it makes more sense you I play PC games and I make PC games because the thing that I know but yeah although in general if you know how to make PC games or mobile games you can easily make one or the other in terms of game design in terms of monetization you have to learn a lot of different things but the technical aspect if you know one you know the other so if you want you can definitely go into both those you explain why all the assets I chose from the unity assets or oh Jason answer so yeah it has to do with the render pipeline so basically when you create a brand new project or yeah so basically pink means Shader error so if you're seeing a bunch of pink that is probably because you're not using the uh render pipeline asset that matches with whatever asset you bought I'm guessing whatever asset you bought is using the uh Universal render pipeline but over here when you create the project you probably use one of these two and these two are using the builtin Runner pipeline and if the assets are using uh urp or hrp shaders then won't show up in pink if you use this so either you need to manually install the universal R pipeline or hdrp on your project or create a brand new project and make sure to pick the correct one so it's actually something really awesome how if you select un6 and now by default it is always going to default into urp or hrp and you have to actively go looking for the builtin run pel so I think this one change alone is actually going to be really awesome is going to prevent many of those many of those uh issues cuz yeah I do see a lot of those comments why are my Assets in pink and the answer is because that's because when creating a brand new project people just default to the default option which default into the built and run pipeline so yeah the fact that Unity 6 will default into urp and hrp hopefully that will actually lead to a lot uh fewer confused people which is always nice oh another Super Chat hey no no thanks uh there anything that ryer offers that vs do not I mean Jason probably is a a better person to answer that uh because I'm not sure I know ryer has tons and tons of features but then again so does visual studio which honestly I don't really use uh that many features I use it as just a normal code editor like I know it has tons of like uh things for analyzing your code doing all kinds of code analysis I know Visual Studio has a massive amount of features but really I use it as just a uh code editor just writing it so yeah for me I really just uh use it super simple but I do know that wrer does have uh quite a lot of extra features so I definitely encourage you to look at it because apparently it is free for education and those things so yeah definitely try it out and then we'll see uh okay so yeah so 640 so yeah let me just uh mainly Havey Unity integration for example it shows the value oh yeah that's nice oh that is useful yeah uh see don't get those annoying calization mistake varable issues when you are confused why it doesn't change yeah that is useful yeah having sometimes where you Mouse over and shows you what it shows what the value you set in the editor yeah I guess that integration can be indeed quite helpful yeah nice uh I guess for me I'm so used to I know where my data lives in general I know what type of data I normally write in the editor what type I normally do so for me I don't normally have that issue but yeah I guess for people who don't know why they're modifying something and doesn't show then yeah having just something that shows you okay you are modifying this field in the editor so whatever you write here in the code does not matter yeah that would definitely help solve quite a lot of frustration also shows what scripts are you used in that in what scene oh that's nice I didn't know that one that does sound quite useful nice so can you copy your soldier a thousand times now without slowdown that's a good question why don't we try it I'm guessing this is not going to go well but uh so yeah basically so the spawning should be working so let me just see okay so the spawning is working uh where did I put now I don't remember where did I put the spawning logic I think I put it on a script B object or nope I didn't nope okay so where did I put that now I got to remember how how did I set this up so it's on the building Barracks is it on the barracks that I hardcoded the value uh no I put it yeah I put it on the oh on the building Barracks component wait on the component where did I oh never mind so the en's reference yeah okay okay so that's where it is uh except oh all right so I hardcoded it in here okay so instead of taking 5 seconds if I put it on 0.1 will this now take just 0.1 second to generate one let's see uh so I place down some Barracks I selected I go and there you go every point one okay nice so now let me go onto the uh building Barrack system and for each one that's or I guess I guess let me try playing around with the UI instead okay so let's see this let's go inside the Barra Y and over here I'm using a dynamic buffer in order to do that so I'm doing an add so for in IAL Z let's go 100 okay so let's see this okay get the feeling this is going to be quite messy but let's see if it works uh okay so basically now I can play some barracks and when I put it it is going all right I mean okay let's see the uh where do I see how many units the empty count uh what do I want where do I see the units yeah I guess they also have yeah but they all go into the same place CU they're okay now spawn a whole bunch of them so yeah yeah they're all going into a pile all going to the exact same place just keep spawning more and more units oh it's interesting so if I hide the UI it's actually fine but if I sh oh never mind yeah cuz the UI I totally forgot yeah so that performance issue is probably because the UI is super massive let's actually look at the UI uh where's the UI oh God I can't even move it can let me pause it why oh because I have hidden the UI here building Barracks okay yeah that's the issue all of those yeah all of these Sprites for the units being being que that is why this is being quite slow yeah if I deselect then it does work like that but if I select that one yeah still a massive queue uh okay so but yeah like this it's uh running at 25 I wonder what is the main thing uh giv can I open up the the Z profiler helping seeing something so the profiler is having some spikes what are these spikes what is taking half a second oh it's the editor okay well that makes sense but now it's the player and generating some garbage on the simulation system group and on the render pipeline really the render pipeline is generating some garbage are the rendering the camera stack oh Define Target oh no but it is not generating but it is okay interesting so now so I guess what someone a while ago was saying about uh about physics queries being slow I guess maybe that is the the thing so yeah definitely well I mean keep in mind that over here I'm not using any uh wait spawn them all nice so is it 600 units because this one says 4,000 oh because I guess each of them has different things so yeah but if I disable the this defined Target system can I can't I disable the system is it over here yeah there you go if I disable that one so basally the physics queries well I mean I guess they have to be uh optimized using jobs cuz right now I'm pretty sure that it's running a physics query for each of them but yeah if not then over here it is spawning tons and tons of units all of them go into a pile because they all go into the exact same position as all of them so I can click them individually to move them away but yeah so yeah I mean I'm pretty sure that if it was using Game objects right now it will already be quite slow so yeah just in this quick little demo it does showcase all kinds of uh interesting things so yeah that does work tons of units tons of stuff spawning units spawning things yeah good for a zombie game yeah exactly dots is perfect so the goal is on the final game to try out and see just how many units are going to are going to be supported how many zombies can I can I get I mean the inspiration for this is very much the store. Ste power uh Ste power.com is is very much they are bains you have something against the V keyword uh I wouldn't necessarily say against just because that sounds very very uh negative but personally I am not a fan of it so I'm not a fan because of how it uh hides away the types that I'm using so generally I don't like that's actually something that I dislike on the uh Unity um uh on their code samples they use VAR quite a lot and sometimes it can make sense like over here okay sure so I can see VAR this one is going to be of type La Builder but there are many times like for example over here this one VAR result and it's a result of this function what does this function return I have no idea so that is why it does like VAR like just looking at this code I have no idea what object what type this is going to return so I have no no idea what this is is this a bullan is it a a blob Builder is it a blob asset is it something like that so yeah I don't like how VAR eliminates things so I can understand in things like this but when it's something like calling a function and it is not immediately clear as to what exactly it's going to return that is where I really doesn't like using VAR because I find that it just makes the code much more confusing needlessly confusing so there's no no benefit it just becomes quite a bit more confusing so that is why personally I'm not a fan of VAR but as you can see here Unity themselves they like VAR a lot of people like using VAR so if you like it go ahead and use it but me personally I like my code to be as explicit as possible I want to know for certain what type I'm using with so what type I'm working with so that is why personally I normally do not use VAR but yep over here they do like using it so if you don't like using it then definitely go ahead and use it what's your batching looking like good question I assume it's all nicely batched or not I never know which one okay so right now it's not being batched is that is that the case I'm trying to think if uh okay so I guess this is why I'm going to have to use the material property block because I'm guessing that is why these but the measures should be shared so that's an that's an interesting one yeah definitely something that I won't have to research and see exactly how it's going to uh how does it batch things like why is it not batching anything I would guess that at least the ones that are on the same frame would be batched or maybe I just need to enable some kind of thing I'm not sure but uh yeah so definitely something slight instancing on material oh good question did I is that not uh enabled where's my material I got to find my material so I got ton of stuff on this project uh is it not instance nope enable it but nope did not change what about yeah the other one doesn't have so frame profiler does the frame profiler show something wait yeah the uh so you got the UI oh rendering the background yeah but this I never know how to how to work with this but I'm pretty sure this means that this is being batched right does the does the frame debugger have some kind of D profile or something because over here it does seem like it is being batched like it is rendering all these and then another group and then another group and so on so it does seem like it is being batg here so I'm not sure why that one over here doesn't say it but it seems like it so yeah I'm not sure I'll definitely have to SRP batching is not relevant here the stats window is wrong basically oh okay interesting uh let's look in the uh just see regular profiler on the rendering down here what does this guy say this one does say 1.3k drw calls something like that but the say not sure definitely going to have to research this quite a bit but I might have to use the material property Block in order to make it render properly so I'm not sure but yeah I'll have to figure that out been a fun break from work but I should get back to my own yeah yeah thanks Jason thanks for being here uh should have a chat at some shade yeah yeah I don't think so yeah I've met Andrew when it was at GDC but I don't think I've met you so yeah that would be fun so someday so yeah bye enjoy enjoy your work uh okay yeah and I'm going to have to be going as well since it's almost 7 p.m and my my dogs are starting to wake up starting to be a little bit fidgety but still this was a successful live stream so I want to research how to do some uh physics queries look at the trigger logic and it did work cuz if I go over here and what we did in the beginning of this live stream so yeah turns out that finding uh doing trigger is actually surprisingly simple go inside the simulation Singleton grab the trigger events or the Collision events then do a four each through all of them and apparently that works so that was much easier than I thought it would be and then for handling the animations yep the core basic idea I still have to try a different other approaches but the core idea is indeed working so yeah all right okay so let me stop this and thanks again and now for the super chat then thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and let me just put it like that and that will be it put that yeah there's no Dy dynamic or static batching for Dots rendering okay yeah I definitely have to uh look into that topic to see what exactly is going wrong if something is going wrong so I don't know I'll definitely have to look at into that um we're okay yeah was the music even playing did the music stop oh I guess my my music stopped a long time ago and I didn't even notice anyways uh okay so let me put that one into that one and that one all right so yeah uh uh thank you all for being here and I hope you have a great rest of your week and I will see you maybe next week something like that didn't know there was supposed to be music there was but apparently it crashed a while ago so anyways uh okay so yeah have a great rest of your uh day week whatever and I will see you next time all right so bye everyone bye bye bye e for
