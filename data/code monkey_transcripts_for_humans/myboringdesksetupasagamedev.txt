00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so one top video that I'd like to watch
00:04 - are Studio or desk tours in those videos
00:06 - people always seem to have these really
00:08 - awesome setups with lots of phantom
00:09 - lights and all kinds of stuff everything
00:11 - always looks so great look at all of
00:13 - this this is all so clean so perfect and
00:15 - of course all the equipment this is
00:17 - usually always high-end expensive stuff
00:18 - there's usually never something old that
00:21 - simply just works for example Mark has a
00:23 - setup it's really just so beautiful and
00:26 - clean it really looks like it could be
00:27 - an art piece there's nothing messy
00:29 - nothing extra nothing is out of place so
00:32 - when I look at those and then I look at
00:33 - my own desk I always ask myself does
00:36 - everyone have these beautiful clean
00:38 - high-end setups and I'm just a messy
00:40 - boring person or is everyone closer to
00:42 - the setup that I've got over here and
00:44 - these are actually the outliers I'd love
00:46 - to see where you work I'm going to post
00:48 - on Twitter so go ahead and show me your
00:49 - setup and this video is also meant to
00:51 - Showcase how you don't need a super
00:53 - high-end super clean setup most of what
00:55 - I have right now I've had for many many
00:57 - years and it has enabled me to make
00:59 - eight Sim games which have grossed over
01:01 - 1 million dollars in 10 years and I'm
01:03 - currently working on my next team game
01:04 - called leaky Gardens it's a fun
01:06 - automation Colony building defense game
01:08 - go ahead and edit your wish list so that
01:10 - said here's my normal basic test store
01:13 - foreign
01:14 - [Music]
01:19 - so here is my desk setup starting off
01:23 - with my main monitor here so this is a
01:25 - bank XL 2420 Zen I bought this ages ago
01:29 - some like eight years ago back then I
01:31 - was really into Counter-Strike so I
01:32 - really wanted something with 144 Hertz
01:34 - so technically it's pretty old it's ATN
01:36 - panel but still works perfectly then
01:39 - next to it I've got a super basic Dell
01:41 - no idea what this is basically when I
01:43 - moved into this place and started using
01:44 - two monitors I just went into the
01:46 - Welcome Store and picked up just the
01:48 - cheapest 1080p monitor there was and
01:50 - again so this one is also still about
01:51 - seven years old and still works
01:53 - perfectly oh crap the zombies are
01:55 - attacking so let me just clean them up
01:59 - okay so back to the tour down here I've
02:01 - got my keyboard so this is a Logitech
02:03 - g915 pretty nice one and I really need
02:06 - the wrist rest otherwise my wrist get
02:08 - all messed up
02:09 - then next to it for my mouse this is in
02:11 - Logitech Pro something something it's
02:13 - actually the first wireless mouse that
02:15 - I've been trying out and actually works
02:17 - surprisingly well I thought the wireless
02:18 - was somewhat noticeable but nowadays the
02:21 - tech is awesome so the wireless is
02:22 - really not noticeable at all this was
02:24 - definitely a great upgrade my mouse pad
02:26 - as you can see has definitely seen
02:27 - better days again this one was also
02:29 - something like 10 years old but hey some
02:31 - works perfectly so there it is then down
02:34 - there is the main thing that I've spent
02:35 - money on just go ahead and ignore the
02:37 - cable management off to the side so in
02:40 - there is a RTX 3090 definitely super
02:42 - expensive but it does help pay off
02:44 - considering how much less the videos
02:46 - take to render
02:47 - so definitely expensive but a worthwhile
02:49 - purchase and for the CPU I've got a
02:52 - ryzen 5950x again lots of cores really
02:55 - great for editing videos this PC is
02:57 - definitely much much better than the
02:58 - previous one that I had previously the
02:59 - renders took about 30 minutes to make
03:01 - for a simple video whereas now it takes
03:03 - five minutes so definitely very
03:04 - worthwhile alright so then up here for
03:06 - my camera I've got a super basic
03:08 - Logitech webcam I think this is the 920s
03:11 - again really basic but it does get the
03:13 - job done although I wouldn't like to
03:15 - upgrade to something a bit better I
03:17 - think my biggest issues with the green
03:18 - screen I think it simply comes from the
03:20 - fact that this camera doesn't really
03:21 - render too well so I definitely would
03:23 - like to upgrade to a proper camera then
03:25 - speaking of cameras the other important
03:27 - thing are of course lights so over there
03:29 - I've got a super basic super simple
03:30 - light I literally just bought the
03:32 - cheapest ring light that I could find
03:34 - and it doesn't really work very well
03:35 - doesn't have much life but then behind
03:37 - it is the Elgato light that one is
03:38 - definitely much better definitely
03:39 - provides a lot more light to go along
03:41 - with the lights I've got my green screen
03:43 - down here
03:45 - okay
03:48 - it's really nice Definitely it's green
03:49 - so definitely works
03:54 - my chair is also super basic you can see
03:56 - it has definitely seen better days I
03:58 - definitely would like to upgrade this
03:59 - one to a proper chair sometime soon next
04:02 - up over here I've got my microphone so
04:05 - this one is a Blue Yeti basically I did
04:07 - a bunch of research before I even
04:08 - started this Channel all the way back in
04:10 - 2018 I did a ton of research and pretty
04:12 - much the consensus was this one was the
04:14 - best one at a pretty reasonable price so
04:16 - I bought it back then in Silver's
04:18 - personally so definitely happy with this
04:19 - one then for some more random stuff over
04:22 - here I got some basic speakers again
04:24 - yeah on those zest tours they've got
04:26 - tons of high-end equipment whereas I've
04:27 - got a lot of super basic stuff for this
04:29 - one I don't even have the other one the
04:31 - other one has been broken for quite some
04:32 - time so I just got this one I have no
04:35 - idea what brand this is I bought the
04:36 - cheapest set of speakers about seven
04:37 - years ago but hey some works it's only
04:40 - gives out sound so that's perfectly fine
04:41 - for me then for something very much not
04:43 - technical over here is my daily design
04:45 - list so my mini whiteboard that I write
04:47 - every single day with my to do things
04:49 - for the day very low Tech but definitely
04:51 - helps me keep track of my daily tasks
04:53 - then over here I've got a real nice
04:55 - Unity notebook they gave me this in a
04:57 - swag bag all the way back in GDC
04:59 - it's real nice so I haven't used it yet
05:01 - I want to make sure that when I use it I
05:03 - use it for something special then over
05:05 - here I've got my watch this is a Samsung
05:07 - Galaxy watch 4. really nice really
05:09 - useful to keep track of workouts and
05:11 - running pretty nice next to it is my
05:13 - stack of books so I've got the daily
05:15 - stoic so really nice to read just one
05:17 - passage every single day nice way to
05:18 - start the day then I've got the Dragon
05:20 - Ball Z manga this is the first manga
05:22 - that I've ever brought and I've been
05:24 - really enjoying it even though I haven't
05:25 - read as much as I would like next with
05:27 - is the swelling Bible this is the book
05:29 - by the channel and Bro Science live so
05:31 - just some fun gym comedy book and then
05:33 - next to it code complete 2. I've
05:35 - mentioned this specific book several
05:37 - times in my videos I genuinely think
05:39 - this is one of the best books that has
05:40 - greatly helped me increase my
05:42 - programming skills everything that I
05:44 - know about writing good clean code most
05:45 - of it came from this book then next to
05:47 - it I've got some eye drops for my dog
05:49 - sometimes his eyes get messed up so he
05:51 - needs a few drops then I've got some
05:53 - pills for my other dog she's getting up
05:55 - in here so this helps then next to it
05:57 - I've got my Samsung earbuds so when I go
05:59 - walk my dogs and I want to listen to
06:01 - some YouTube videos some podcasts
06:02 - something so this is what I take with me
06:04 - then I've got a nice kunai next to it
06:06 - I've got a really nice fat boo then I've
06:09 - got a really nice tiger a real nice
06:11 - Unity ducky and a really nice Gogeta so
06:14 - just some super basic decoration
06:15 - definitely no RGB and lights everywhere
06:17 - next to it I've got a bunch more to-do
06:19 - lists I've got lots of biscuits for my
06:21 - dogs and I've got my general calendar
06:23 - this is definitely not fixing some of
06:25 - this changes a lot but this is roughly
06:27 - how I keep up to date with which videos
06:28 - are coming out when and on there I've
06:30 - got my t-shirts I definitely should have
06:32 - a problem place to put them but so far
06:34 - they're just in a pile and then I've got
06:36 - my own laptop this is an LG gram I have
06:39 - no idea what model this is pretty basic
06:41 - but really nice I basically just use my
06:43 - laptop to reply to comments or do some
06:45 - researching or writing a video so I
06:47 - don't need anything too special I don't
06:48 - normally do any Unity developing or any
06:50 - editing over here so some basic works
06:52 - and I think that's it
06:56 - [Music]
06:59 - so hopefully this video helps give a
07:02 - more realistic view of what a setup is
07:03 - like or perhaps not perhaps everyone has
07:06 - those beautiful high and clean setups
07:07 - and mine is really by comparison very
07:09 - basic and boring I definitely look
07:11 - forward to seeing what your setups look
07:12 - like and don't forget to add dinky
07:14 - Gardens to your wishlist alright thanks
07:16 - for watching and I'll see you next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so one top video that I'd like to watch are Studio or desk tours in those videos people always seem to have these really awesome setups with lots of phantom

nothing extra nothing is out of place so when I look at those and then I look at my own desk I always ask myself does everyone have these beautiful clean highend setups and I'm just a messy boring person or is everyone closer to the setup that I've got over here and these are actually the outliers I'd love to see where you work I'm going to post on Twitter so go ahead and show me your setup and
