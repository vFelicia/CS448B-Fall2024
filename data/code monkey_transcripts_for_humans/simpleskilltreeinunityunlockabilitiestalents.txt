00:00 - in this video we're going to create a
00:01 - skill tree to unlock new abilities in
00:03 - unity we're going to create the UI and
00:06 - make each skill have a specific path to
00:08 - be unlocked it will be integrated with
00:10 - the previously made local system in
00:11 - order to get skill points let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:26 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:30 - video helpful consider subscribing okay
00:32 - so this is what we want to make over
00:33 - here is my player character and I can
00:35 - move them around and in here we have the
00:37 - skill tree as you can see some skills
00:40 - are completely unlocked because they
00:41 - have certain specific requirements so in
00:44 - order to unlock the Earth's shadow first
00:45 - I need to unlock the whirlwind however
00:47 - it is also based on skill points so
00:49 - right now I cannot unlock the whirlwind
00:51 - because I have no skill points now I can
00:53 - spawn some enemies and as you can see
00:56 - when I kill them down here is the
00:57 - experience bar and yet there you go I
00:59 - gain experience for every enemy I kill
01:01 - and once I kill enough there you go I
01:04 - level up and over here we gain one scan
01:06 - point so this is using the unlevel
01:08 - system that we made in a previous video
01:10 - so go check that out and now that we
01:12 - have one scan point we can use it to
01:13 - unlock any of these skills so for
01:15 - example let's unlock the woman Surigao
01:17 - the whirlwind is unlocked and now we can
01:19 - unlock the earth shatter but again we
01:21 - don't have any skill points so let's get
01:22 - some more let's go on some more enemies
01:24 - use the whirlwind and there you go kill
01:27 - them all and over here we get a ton of
01:28 - exp with that exp we get more skill
01:31 - points and now we can unlock more skills
01:33 - once again they have specific paths so I
01:35 - cannot watch this one before I'm walking
01:37 - this one mark that one and now that one
01:39 - down and now spawns more enemies and in
01:42 - this case use earth shatter and there
01:44 - you go take them all out get tons of exp
01:45 - tons of skill points and tons of
01:47 - everything the whirlwind and the earth
01:49 - shatter are actually the same skills
01:50 - that I use in hyper nights that game is
01:53 - included in the game and also go pick it
01:54 - up to play it so just like that over
01:57 - here we have our nice game mode fully
01:58 - working so we go out we kill a bunch of
02:01 - enemies so there you go just kill them
02:03 - all take them all out and as we kill
02:05 - them we gain some exp with the XP we
02:07 - level up we gain some skill points you
02:09 - spend some points in order to get some
02:10 - new skills and then we kill more enemies
02:13 - get more skill points more level more
02:15 - exp more skills and more everything so
02:17 - here we have our awesome mini game this
02:19 - video is made possible thanks to these
02:21 - awesome supporters go to
02:22 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
02:25 - get some perks and help keep the videos
02:26 - free for everyone alright so this our
02:28 - goal let's get to it okay here we are in
02:31 - our starring team I have my player
02:33 - character
02:33 - that I can move around and I have some
02:35 - enemies being spawned down here you can
02:38 - see the experience bar as I kill enemies
02:40 - it goes up and with enough exp the
02:43 - character and levels up so this was made
02:47 - in the unlevel system and it's what
02:48 - we're going to use in here in order to
02:50 - generate skill points all right so this
02:52 - is our start now back in the editor
02:54 - let's begin making the UI visual so over
02:57 - here on our canvas let's make a new UI
03:00 - call this our UI skill tree and in here
03:05 - let's just build a very basic button all
03:14 - right so here's our very basic button
03:16 - now for handling clicks I'm going to add
03:18 - the button UI component this is part of
03:21 - the code monkey Toby's that you can grow
03:23 - up for free from unity code Macomb this
03:25 - is a very simple component it just
03:26 - handles a bunch of Mouse interactions
03:28 - now let's make the script to handle our
03:30 - skill tree window so on our scripts
03:32 - folder let's create the new one and call
03:34 - it our UI skill tree and let's drag it
03:37 - in okay now in here let's just grab a
03:40 - reference to our button so when we click
03:48 - we're going to execute this action in
03:50 - here and for now let's just do a simple
03:52 - debug model all right that should do it
03:55 - let's test so here we are and click and
03:57 - we go we have our click alright so far
03:59 - so good
04:00 - now let's test and lock in a specific
04:01 - skill here the player is managed by this
04:04 - script as you can see it's pretty simple
04:06 - just sixteen lines long and then here
04:09 - we're taking care of the experience bar
04:10 - and matching it with the other level
04:12 - system then down here we have a bunch of
04:14 - functions that we're going to use for
04:15 - unlocking our skills so we have a
04:17 - function to test if we can use the earth
04:19 - shatter or warm wind or set a different
04:22 - movement speed and health amount max so
04:24 - now when we click on button let's invoke
04:26 - a specific skill however we do not want
04:28 - to do that directly we don't want to
04:30 - play a class to directly interface with
04:31 - the UI so for that let's make a proper
04:34 - class to handle all of our skills so
04:36 - here we make a new c-sharp script and
04:38 - let's call this our player skills here
04:41 - let's make this a very simple function
04:43 - so you get rid of everything including
04:45 - model behavior all right
04:46 - have a simple basic class and first of
04:49 - all it's making a noon to define all of
04:51 - our skills and for starters let's just
04:54 - try out the earth chatter then let's add
04:56 - a function to unlock a specific skill so
05:00 - this is the function that we're going to
05:01 - call from the UI in order to and welcome
05:04 - let's just keep track of all the ones
05:05 - that are already unlocked
05:09 - so we have a list of skill types and on
05:12 - our constructor we simply initialize our
05:14 - list then when we have the unlock we
05:16 - simply go into our list and we add our
05:18 - News compiled all right very simple now
05:22 - let's have a function in order to test
05:23 - if a specific skill type has been
05:25 - unlocked and now we do is we ask the
05:33 - list if it contains this particulars
05:34 - counter all right so here we have a very
05:36 - simple class to handle all of our player
05:38 - skills and now we can go back into our
05:40 - play class and then here let's go all
05:43 - the way up here to make a field for our
05:44 - player skills and then awake we
05:47 - initialize it all right and now down
05:51 - here on our function where we test if we
05:53 - can use the earth shatter we're going to
05:55 - ask the player skills class if the skill
05:57 - was involved and we're going to pass in
05:59 - the earth shatter all right so that's it
06:01 - now we have a specific class dedicated
06:03 - to handling all of the player skills now
06:06 - all we need to do is make sure that our
06:07 - UI interfaces with this function so to
06:10 - do that let's make a script to handle
06:12 - our connections back in the other term
06:13 - let's make a new c-sharp script call it
06:16 - our testing and make a game object to
06:18 - hone our script and drag the script onto
06:21 - it okay now in here let's add a field
06:23 - for the u.s. country as well as the
06:25 - player so we have references to our
06:31 - player and to our UI skull tree now we
06:33 - want the skill tree to interface with
06:35 - the players player skills so let's go
06:37 - into the UI skill tree and in here let's
06:40 - make a function to receive the player
06:41 - skills
06:45 - okay we have this function which
06:47 - receives our player skills and we set
06:49 - our internal field and then when you
06:52 - click on the skill we go into our player
06:54 - skills and we call unlock skill and we
06:56 - unlock the earth shatter all right so
07:00 - now we need to call this so for that
07:02 - here on testing we go into the UI skill
07:04 - tree and we can't set all your skills so
07:06 - now we need a reference to our player
07:07 - skills so let's going to the player and
07:09 - here and let's make a function to return
07:11 - this field all right so here we will
07:16 - return the player skills and now on
07:18 - testing we set it on the UI tree and we
07:20 - grab it from the player all right so all
07:23 - this should be working essentially we
07:25 - made a class to handle all of our skills
07:27 - so this class is only one responsibility
07:29 - then the player class holds an instance
07:32 - of our player skills and then we have
07:34 - the UI which interacts with the player
07:36 - skills that it receives so if our code
07:38 - is nicely separated and everything
07:40 - should be working
07:41 - what's test ok here we are and the earth
07:43 - shadow skill is on a button and I'm
07:46 - pressing the button and note nothing is
07:48 - happening so the skill is currently
07:50 - locked now let's click on this button
07:52 - and now we have unlocked the skill and
07:54 - press the button again and there you go
07:56 - there's my earth shatter skill so just
07:58 - like this we managed to unlock a skill
07:59 - by pressing a button on the UI awesome
08:02 - so with the structure that we built here
08:04 - we already have our 1 skill and we can
08:06 - easily unlock a bunch more skills so
08:08 - let's add the rest all right so here
08:15 - I've added more inium films for the
08:16 - remaining skill types now let's make the
08:19 - UI visuals
08:35 - all right so here I have had a bunch
08:38 - more buttons so we have the movement
08:40 - seed movement speed to health one how to
08:42 - the whirlwind and the earth shatter and
08:44 - now in our player scale we already have
08:46 - our e-news just one thing over here on
08:49 - the unlock we're currently adding always
08:51 - no matter what so let's do a simple
08:53 - check to make sure the skill isn't
08:54 - already unlocked in case we accidentally
08:56 - unlock it twice so if it is not yet
09:00 - unlocked then we unlock it okay now we
09:03 - need to call this function so on the UI
09:05 - is country let's decode for all the
09:07 - other buttons alright so here we're just
09:16 - calling a simple function on the mouse
09:18 - click ok and now back in the player in
09:21 - here and let's send all the skills so
09:23 - here on the whirlwind let's use the same
09:25 - thing that we did on the earth shatter
09:27 - but in here we use this one okay
09:29 - so these two are working but now for the
09:32 - movement speed and health amount it's a
09:34 - bit different we need to actively no
09:35 - windows get unlocked so what's going to
09:38 - our player skills and in here let's make
09:40 - an event so here we have an event on
09:44 - skill on what and let's also make an
09:47 - event aargh so we can pass in what skill
09:49 - we unlocked so we have our event passing
09:54 - enough type on skill unlock the event
09:56 - args which contains a skill type so now
09:59 - let's call this event so down here when
10:01 - we unlock we add it to the list and then
10:03 - we fire off the infant so invoke with
10:06 - this and the new unlock cards then we
10:08 - pass in the skill type as our skin type
10:13 - alright so we have this event being
10:15 - fired whenever the scale gets and what
10:17 - so you can go back into the player and
10:19 - now we go all the way up here when we
10:20 - are in sin cheating our player skills
10:22 - let's subscribe to the on skill unlocked
10:24 - event and now when that happens let's do
10:27 - a switch on our skill type in case we
10:31 - have for example the move speed one then
10:34 - here and let's modify our things so we
10:35 - use this function in order to set our
10:37 - movement speed so on move speed one
10:41 - let's put it and let's say at 65 and
10:43 - then
10:43 - sweetu another all right now for the
10:47 - hump max alright so this should be
10:55 - working so what we did was we added some
10:58 - more enum values onto our skin types
11:00 - then we're unlocking those skills
11:02 - through this function which gets called
11:04 - through our UI and on the UI we also
11:06 - built the various buttons so then when
11:09 - this function is called and we unlock a
11:10 - skill we fire off an event and then on
11:13 - the player we are listening to that
11:14 - event and when that happens if it's a
11:17 - move speed or health max we modify that
11:19 - one immediately and if not then we have
11:21 - the functions asking if we can use our
11:23 - skills and if so we just has the player
11:25 - skills if the skill is unlocked all
11:27 - right so all that should be working
11:29 - let's test ok here and I'm going to try
11:32 - to do the earth shatter and nope can't
11:34 - do it the whirlwind nope and here I got
11:36 - the normal movement speed and the normal
11:39 - health bar so now let's unlock the
11:40 - whirlwind and now I hit it and there you
11:43 - go there's the warm wind skill now
11:45 - unlock the earth chatter and use a skill
11:47 - and there you I can use it now let's
11:49 - unlock the movement speed so this is in
11:50 - our movement speed click it and there
11:53 - you go now it's a bit faster and
11:54 - movement speed too and there you go now
11:56 - it's quite a lot faster now for the help
11:58 - there you go the health bar and that and
11:59 - walking it's a bit bigger and that and
12:01 - it's a bit bigger alright so here we
12:04 - have all of our skills being unlocked
12:05 - awesome so just like this our skill tree
12:08 - is already looking great now one thing
12:10 - that is usually common in skill trees is
12:12 - having a certain path so certain skills
12:14 - have other requirements before they can
12:16 - be unlocked so let's do that over here
12:19 - in our player skills let's simply make a
12:21 - function that will return the
12:23 - requirements for a particular skill so
12:25 - for example the health max 2 will have a
12:27 - requirement of health max 1
12:38 - all right so we have our requirement and
12:41 - now here we have a particular issue due
12:42 - to the fact that we're working with in
12:44 - ohms so that is how we're going to deal
12:46 - with skills that do not have any
12:47 - requirement so the very first ones when
12:50 - approach would be to make this knowable
12:52 - and we could then return null this would
12:55 - work but honestly it doesn't look very
12:56 - good so instead let's keep it to
12:58 - returning a scum type and then we go up
13:00 - here and we simply have the first come
13:02 - type as our default none so this
13:04 - represents no scale type and then here
13:07 - we simply return that all right so we
13:10 - have our get scale requirement and now
13:12 - let's make a function to try to unlock a
13:14 - certain skill so the UI won't use this
13:19 - function instead of the one that
13:20 - actually unlocks it so we can make this
13:22 - one private and now here let's get the
13:25 - requirement for the skill so we have our
13:30 - requirement then we check if the
13:33 - requirement is not none so if we do have
13:37 - requirement then we check if is skill
13:40 - and whopped if the requirement has been
13:42 - unlocked and if so then we can indeed
13:45 - unlock this skill and if it has no
13:49 - requirement then of course we can unlock
13:51 - it but if it has a requirement and the
13:54 - requirement is not unlocked then we
13:56 - cannot unlock it now let's make this
13:58 - return a boolean in order for the UI to
14:00 - know if the skill was unlocked or not so
14:03 - here if we can well let's return true
14:05 - and if we can't unlock then we return
14:08 - false
14:09 - all right so now we have a function
14:11 - which tries to unlock the skill now
14:13 - let's go into our UI and in here as you
14:15 - can see we got our read error since this
14:18 - one is now private instead we need to
14:20 - use the try and a lot of skill so we
14:22 - replaced all those just like that and
14:25 - now this function you may return a
14:26 - boolean in case it succeeds or fails so
14:29 - you can use that in order to show a nice
14:31 - tooltip warning
14:35 - so here I'm using the tooltip warning
14:37 - which was made in a previous video so go
14:40 - check that out and now let's just apply
14:42 - to Alden now here we should really clean
14:47 - up this code since all of this has a lot
14:49 - of duplicated code but for now it should
14:51 - work just for testing so let's test it
14:53 - out okay so here we are now let's try to
14:56 - and while come to read way so I click
14:58 - and there you go I have an error I
14:59 - cannot unlock it since it has this one
15:01 - as a requirement so first and lock this
15:03 - one there we go the hump bar increased
15:05 - and now I can lock this one and there we
15:06 - go it worked so if i unlock movements
15:08 - feet to right away it doesn't work get
15:10 - the first one then the second one and if
15:11 - there you go just like that
15:13 - alright so with this we have our skill
15:15 - requirements working awesome
15:17 - now let's handle the UI visuals so here
15:20 - in the editor we're going to first show
15:21 - the unlock skills in black and white and
15:23 - low alpha and the skills that we can
15:25 - unlock in black and white with foam
15:27 - alpha and the unlock skills with normal
15:29 - colors so here in the project files I
15:31 - have a black and white shader so here it
15:34 - is very simple we just have our main
15:36 - texture we sample it then we use a
15:38 - saturation notes at the saturation to
15:40 - zero then we take the RGB we multiply it
15:43 - by a certain alpha we combine it all and
15:46 - we pass it into our sprite master node
15:47 - so now let's make our two materials so
15:54 - we have the skill marked and a skill
15:56 - unlockable now we're going to appoint
15:58 - this dynamically so let's go into our UI
16:00 - script and up here let's add our fields
16:05 - so we have our films for the skill mark
16:07 - material any unlockable material so here
16:10 - in the editor and let's drag our
16:11 - references okay good
16:13 - now let's make a update visuals function
16:16 - in here we test if the player skills
16:19 - lets us if a certain skill is unlocked
16:22 - so let's as the earth shatter if so then
16:25 - we go into the image on the UI and we
16:31 - modify the material and we set it to
16:34 - null so that it uses the default so if
16:37 - it isn't well then we set the default if
16:39 - it is not a lock then we need to ask if
16:42 - we can unlock it
16:49 - so we asked if we can unlock if so we
16:52 - use this material if not then we use
16:53 - this one so now let's just make this
16:55 - function so here we're just doing pretty
17:02 - much same logic as in here so we can now
17:05 - simplify this one to use this one all
17:12 - right so here we have it we have a nice
17:13 - function to ask if we can unlock so the
17:16 - UI skill tree we're using that one in
17:18 - order to define what material we should
17:19 - use so now we just need to actually
17:21 - update our visuals so we're going to
17:24 - update first of all when you receive the
17:26 - player stones we update it and then when
17:28 - we get the player skills we're also
17:29 - going to subscribe to the on skill
17:32 - unlocked event and when that happens we
17:34 - also update our videos all right so this
17:36 - should be working and we should be able
17:38 - to see the earth shadow button working
17:39 - correctly so let's test ok so here we
17:42 - are and here four stars it starts off
17:44 - black and white and transparent so it
17:45 - means it's completely locked and we
17:47 - cannot unlock it so first we unlock the
17:49 - one and there you go now it's just black
17:51 - and white and full so meaning that we
17:52 - can unlock it now we click we unlock it
17:55 - and now it's full color so now it says
17:57 - that it's already unlocked all right so
17:59 - we have a very visual indicator of which
18:01 - skills we can unlock now let's apply the
18:03 - colors also to background and to all the
18:06 - other skills
18:45 - all right so here I've refactor the code
18:48 - in order to have the same behavior for
18:50 - all the buttons but not have so much
18:52 - code copy pasting so I created a simple
18:55 - class to represent a single skill button
18:57 - and in here we have the update visual
18:59 - instead of having up here for every
19:01 - single one then we have instances of
19:03 - skill button and we update our visual
19:04 - and then in here we receive our
19:06 - transform the player skills and so on so
19:08 - we're doing exactly the same thing but
19:10 - our class is now much more clean so now
19:12 - let's test this out and everything
19:13 - should be working all right here we are
19:15 - and yet we have a visual difference
19:17 - between the ones that can be unlocked
19:19 - and ones that are still locked so now
19:21 - for example let's unlock our movement
19:23 - speed 1 and there you go that one turned
19:24 - into color and now that one is available
19:26 - so I can unlock it yep just like that so
19:28 - unlock that one yep its unlock now I can
19:30 - unlock this one and just like that
19:32 - alright so here we have our lock and
19:35 - unlock system working awesome now let's
19:37 - add some lines so we can see the unlock
19:39 - path so first let's add them over here
19:42 - in the editor
19:55 - all right so here I have added the three
19:57 - lines for our three and links between
19:59 - the skills now let's go into our script
20:01 - and here let's make a class to hem all
20:03 - our connections inside we have filmed
20:07 - for the skill time and the image array
20:09 - for our connections and then art for
20:15 - this class you show up in the editor we
20:17 - need to add the attribute serializable
20:20 - okay just like that and now all the way
20:23 - up here let's have an array of skill
20:25 - unlock paths and now we can go back in
20:31 - the editor so here's our script and we
20:33 - have our skill unlock pathway so we're
20:35 - going to have three unlock paths so for
20:37 - example the first one for movement speed
20:39 - two and we're going to have one image
20:41 - which is this one in here now the same
20:44 - for the rest all right we have our
20:45 - references now we go down into the
20:48 - visual function and let's first make
20:51 - them all dark so first we darken on the
21:06 - links and then afterwards we go through
21:08 - them again so here we have the skill
21:17 - that is either unlocked or can be
21:19 - unlocked so here let's show with the
21:21 - gold color
21:24 - alright so that's about it and now here
21:27 - I have these two textures the normal
21:29 - line and line glow so let's also use
21:31 - that to make it even more impactful
21:38 - alright let's test okay so here we are
21:41 - and yet we can see that our links are
21:42 - all dark and now if i unlock this one
21:45 - there you go now it becomes visible so
21:46 - now it's much more clear that i can now
21:48 - unlock this one so what this one there
21:50 - you go it changes and it changes alright
21:52 - awesome okay so here we have pretty much
21:55 - our entire skill tree working now
21:57 - finally just for fun I'm going to
21:59 - implement the eleven system that we made
22:01 - previously so we can level up to get
22:03 - skill points that we can then use
22:12 - so here I've added a indicator for these
22:15 - skill points on the UI so here we have
22:17 - these skill points text and now here on
22:19 - the player script it already has the
22:21 - unlevel system and the own level system
22:23 - fires off an event when the own level
22:24 - changes so here's where we're setting
22:26 - the indicator for the on level text in
22:28 - order to see how the own level system
22:29 - works make sure you check out that video
22:30 - so here we can handle getting some skill
22:33 - points so let's go into our player
22:35 - skills in order to store a certain
22:37 - number of skill points and here we got a
22:39 - private in just a something very simple
22:42 - and a function to add them and on the
22:48 - player when the player levels up we go
22:50 - into our player skills and we add news
22:52 - comfort now on the player skills when we
22:55 - try to and welcome let's make sure that
22:56 - we have enough skill points so when you
22:59 - try run/walk we test if we can unlock
23:01 - based on the requirements then we also
23:03 - test if skill points are more than zero
23:05 - then we reduce our skill points and we
23:07 - unmoor all right here it is now we just
23:12 - need to deal with the visual for its
23:13 - components so like always let's make a
23:15 - nice event to keep our code nice and
23:16 - clean so you have a simple event and
23:20 - when we add a stem point we invoke it
23:22 - and we do the same when we spend one so
23:27 - down here when we are spinning we fire
23:29 - off this event alright great so now on
23:32 - the UI lets get that visual
23:52 - all right so here it is very simple when
23:55 - we set the player skills we subscribe to
23:57 - the event and we update like we always
23:58 - do
23:59 - ok so let's test ok so here we are and
24:02 - we currently are on level 1 so we have 0
24:05 - skill points so even though technically
24:06 - we can unlock this skill because it has
24:08 - no requirements we don't have these
24:09 - skill points so if you try to click nope
24:11 - we cannot unlock it
24:13 - so now let's spawn some enemies and
24:15 - there you go hit him and one more and
24:17 - there you go now we need one more so
24:20 - let's spawn some more and there you go
24:21 - now we are in level 2 and yet we have
24:23 - one skill point so take these out and
24:25 - now we can try to spend it so let's
24:26 - click and there you go we've unlocked
24:28 - the whirlwind and now again we got no
24:31 - more skill points so let's once more
24:33 - enemy
24:33 - now let's seize the whirlwind kill them
24:35 - all and there you go and lots of skill
24:37 - points and yep they're there now unlock
24:39 - the earth shatter
24:40 - let's spawn a bunch more enemies and use
24:42 - the earth shattering there you go and we
24:44 - can walk a bunch more just like that
24:46 - alright so here we have our nice game
24:49 - loop fully working so we have a level
24:51 - system and a skill tree we have our
24:53 - skill point so we cannot spend them if
24:55 - we don't have them then we spawn some
24:57 - enemy so we go out we kill some enemies
24:58 - by killing some enemies we get some
25:01 - experience with enough experience we get
25:03 - and level up within level up we get some
25:05 - skill points with some points we can
25:07 - unlock new skills so you can spawn more
25:09 - enemies kill them get more exp more
25:12 - levels more skill points and spend them
25:14 - all on everything so just like this we
25:17 - have our nice skill tree with our very
25:18 - skills working in tandem with the
25:20 - unlevel system our skill tree also has
25:22 - previous requirements so we can make
25:24 - some very specific unlock paths alright
25:27 - so once again here it is our awesome

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to create a skill tree to unlock new abilities in unity we're going to create the UI and make each skill have a specific path to be unlocked it will be integrated with the previously made local system in order to get skill points let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so this is what we want to make over here is my player character and I can move them around and in here we have the skill tree as you can see some skills are completely unlocked because they have certain specific requirements so in order to unlock the Earth's shadow first I need to unlock the whirlwind however it is also based on skill points so right now I cannot unlock the whirlwind because I have no skill points now I can spawn some enemies and as you can see when I kill them down here is the experience bar and yet there you go I gain experience for every enemy I kill and once I kill enough there you go I level up and over here we gain one scan point so this is using the unlevel system that we made in a previous video so go check that out and now that we have one scan point we can use it to unlock any of these skills so for example let's unlock the woman Surigao the whirlwind is unlocked and now we can unlock the earth shatter but again we don't have any skill points so let's get some more let's go on some more enemies use the whirlwind and there you go kill them all and over here we get a ton of exp with that exp we get more skill points and now we can unlock more skills once again they have specific paths so I cannot watch this one before I'm walking this one mark that one and now that one down and now spawns more enemies and in this case use earth shatter and there you go take them all out get tons of exp tons of skill points and tons of everything the whirlwind and the earth shatter are actually the same skills that I use in hyper nights that game is included in the game and also go pick it up to play it so just like that over here we have our nice game mode fully working so we go out we kill a bunch of enemies so there you go just kill them all take them all out and as we kill them we gain some exp with the XP we level up we gain some skill points you spend some points in order to get some new skills and then we kill more enemies get more skill points more level more exp more skills and more everything so here we have our awesome mini game this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright so this our goal let's get to it okay here we are in our starring team I have my player character that I can move around and I have some enemies being spawned down here you can see the experience bar as I kill enemies it goes up and with enough exp the character and levels up so this was made in the unlevel system and it's what we're going to use in here in order to generate skill points all right so this is our start now back in the editor let's begin making the UI visual so over here on our canvas let's make a new UI call this our UI skill tree and in here let's just build a very basic button all right so here's our very basic button now for handling clicks I'm going to add the button UI component this is part of the code monkey Toby's that you can grow up for free from unity code Macomb this is a very simple component it just handles a bunch of Mouse interactions now let's make the script to handle our skill tree window so on our scripts folder let's create the new one and call it our UI skill tree and let's drag it in okay now in here let's just grab a reference to our button so when we click we're going to execute this action in here and for now let's just do a simple debug model all right that should do it let's test so here we are and click and we go we have our click alright so far so good now let's test and lock in a specific skill here the player is managed by this script as you can see it's pretty simple just sixteen lines long and then here we're taking care of the experience bar and matching it with the other level system then down here we have a bunch of functions that we're going to use for unlocking our skills so we have a function to test if we can use the earth shatter or warm wind or set a different movement speed and health amount max so now when we click on button let's invoke a specific skill however we do not want to do that directly we don't want to play a class to directly interface with the UI so for that let's make a proper class to handle all of our skills so here we make a new csharp script and let's call this our player skills here let's make this a very simple function so you get rid of everything including model behavior all right have a simple basic class and first of all it's making a noon to define all of our skills and for starters let's just try out the earth chatter then let's add a function to unlock a specific skill so this is the function that we're going to call from the UI in order to and welcome let's just keep track of all the ones that are already unlocked so we have a list of skill types and on our constructor we simply initialize our list then when we have the unlock we simply go into our list and we add our News compiled all right very simple now let's have a function in order to test if a specific skill type has been unlocked and now we do is we ask the list if it contains this particulars counter all right so here we have a very simple class to handle all of our player skills and now we can go back into our play class and then here let's go all the way up here to make a field for our player skills and then awake we initialize it all right and now down here on our function where we test if we can use the earth shatter we're going to ask the player skills class if the skill was involved and we're going to pass in the earth shatter all right so that's it now we have a specific class dedicated to handling all of the player skills now all we need to do is make sure that our UI interfaces with this function so to do that let's make a script to handle our connections back in the other term let's make a new csharp script call it our testing and make a game object to hone our script and drag the script onto it okay now in here let's add a field for the u.s. country as well as the player so we have references to our player and to our UI skull tree now we want the skill tree to interface with the players player skills so let's go into the UI skill tree and in here let's make a function to receive the player skills okay we have this function which receives our player skills and we set our internal field and then when you click on the skill we go into our player skills and we call unlock skill and we unlock the earth shatter all right so now we need to call this so for that here on testing we go into the UI skill tree and we can't set all your skills so now we need a reference to our player skills so let's going to the player and here and let's make a function to return this field all right so here we will return the player skills and now on testing we set it on the UI tree and we grab it from the player all right so all this should be working essentially we made a class to handle all of our skills so this class is only one responsibility then the player class holds an instance of our player skills and then we have the UI which interacts with the player skills that it receives so if our code is nicely separated and everything should be working what's test ok here we are and the earth shadow skill is on a button and I'm pressing the button and note nothing is happening so the skill is currently locked now let's click on this button and now we have unlocked the skill and press the button again and there you go there's my earth shatter skill so just like this we managed to unlock a skill by pressing a button on the UI awesome so with the structure that we built here we already have our 1 skill and we can easily unlock a bunch more skills so let's add the rest all right so here I've added more inium films for the remaining skill types now let's make the UI visuals all right so here I have had a bunch more buttons so we have the movement seed movement speed to health one how to the whirlwind and the earth shatter and now in our player scale we already have our enews just one thing over here on the unlock we're currently adding always no matter what so let's do a simple check to make sure the skill isn't already unlocked in case we accidentally unlock it twice so if it is not yet unlocked then we unlock it okay now we need to call this function so on the UI is country let's decode for all the other buttons alright so here we're just calling a simple function on the mouse click ok and now back in the player in here and let's send all the skills so here on the whirlwind let's use the same thing that we did on the earth shatter but in here we use this one okay so these two are working but now for the movement speed and health amount it's a bit different we need to actively no windows get unlocked so what's going to our player skills and in here let's make an event so here we have an event on skill on what and let's also make an event aargh so we can pass in what skill we unlocked so we have our event passing enough type on skill unlock the event args which contains a skill type so now let's call this event so down here when we unlock we add it to the list and then we fire off the infant so invoke with this and the new unlock cards then we pass in the skill type as our skin type alright so we have this event being fired whenever the scale gets and what so you can go back into the player and now we go all the way up here when we are in sin cheating our player skills let's subscribe to the on skill unlocked event and now when that happens let's do a switch on our skill type in case we have for example the move speed one then here and let's modify our things so we use this function in order to set our movement speed so on move speed one let's put it and let's say at 65 and then sweetu another all right now for the hump max alright so this should be working so what we did was we added some more enum values onto our skin types then we're unlocking those skills through this function which gets called through our UI and on the UI we also built the various buttons so then when this function is called and we unlock a skill we fire off an event and then on the player we are listening to that event and when that happens if it's a move speed or health max we modify that one immediately and if not then we have the functions asking if we can use our skills and if so we just has the player skills if the skill is unlocked all right so all that should be working let's test ok here and I'm going to try to do the earth shatter and nope can't do it the whirlwind nope and here I got the normal movement speed and the normal health bar so now let's unlock the whirlwind and now I hit it and there you go there's the warm wind skill now unlock the earth chatter and use a skill and there you I can use it now let's unlock the movement speed so this is in our movement speed click it and there you go now it's a bit faster and movement speed too and there you go now it's quite a lot faster now for the help there you go the health bar and that and walking it's a bit bigger and that and it's a bit bigger alright so here we have all of our skills being unlocked awesome so just like this our skill tree is already looking great now one thing that is usually common in skill trees is having a certain path so certain skills have other requirements before they can be unlocked so let's do that over here in our player skills let's simply make a function that will return the requirements for a particular skill so for example the health max 2 will have a requirement of health max 1 all right so we have our requirement and now here we have a particular issue due to the fact that we're working with in ohms so that is how we're going to deal with skills that do not have any requirement so the very first ones when approach would be to make this knowable and we could then return null this would work but honestly it doesn't look very good so instead let's keep it to returning a scum type and then we go up here and we simply have the first come type as our default none so this represents no scale type and then here we simply return that all right so we have our get scale requirement and now let's make a function to try to unlock a certain skill so the UI won't use this function instead of the one that actually unlocks it so we can make this one private and now here let's get the requirement for the skill so we have our requirement then we check if the requirement is not none so if we do have requirement then we check if is skill and whopped if the requirement has been unlocked and if so then we can indeed unlock this skill and if it has no requirement then of course we can unlock it but if it has a requirement and the requirement is not unlocked then we cannot unlock it now let's make this return a boolean in order for the UI to know if the skill was unlocked or not so here if we can well let's return true and if we can't unlock then we return false all right so now we have a function which tries to unlock the skill now let's go into our UI and in here as you can see we got our read error since this one is now private instead we need to use the try and a lot of skill so we replaced all those just like that and now this function you may return a boolean in case it succeeds or fails so you can use that in order to show a nice tooltip warning so here I'm using the tooltip warning which was made in a previous video so go check that out and now let's just apply to Alden now here we should really clean up this code since all of this has a lot of duplicated code but for now it should work just for testing so let's test it out okay so here we are now let's try to and while come to read way so I click and there you go I have an error I cannot unlock it since it has this one as a requirement so first and lock this one there we go the hump bar increased and now I can lock this one and there we go it worked so if i unlock movements feet to right away it doesn't work get the first one then the second one and if there you go just like that alright so with this we have our skill requirements working awesome now let's handle the UI visuals so here in the editor we're going to first show the unlock skills in black and white and low alpha and the skills that we can unlock in black and white with foam alpha and the unlock skills with normal colors so here in the project files I have a black and white shader so here it is very simple we just have our main texture we sample it then we use a saturation notes at the saturation to zero then we take the RGB we multiply it by a certain alpha we combine it all and we pass it into our sprite master node so now let's make our two materials so we have the skill marked and a skill unlockable now we're going to appoint this dynamically so let's go into our UI script and up here let's add our fields so we have our films for the skill mark material any unlockable material so here in the editor and let's drag our references okay good now let's make a update visuals function in here we test if the player skills lets us if a certain skill is unlocked so let's as the earth shatter if so then we go into the image on the UI and we modify the material and we set it to null so that it uses the default so if it isn't well then we set the default if it is not a lock then we need to ask if we can unlock it so we asked if we can unlock if so we use this material if not then we use this one so now let's just make this function so here we're just doing pretty much same logic as in here so we can now simplify this one to use this one all right so here we have it we have a nice function to ask if we can unlock so the UI skill tree we're using that one in order to define what material we should use so now we just need to actually update our visuals so we're going to update first of all when you receive the player stones we update it and then when we get the player skills we're also going to subscribe to the on skill unlocked event and when that happens we also update our videos all right so this should be working and we should be able to see the earth shadow button working correctly so let's test ok so here we are and here four stars it starts off black and white and transparent so it means it's completely locked and we cannot unlock it so first we unlock the one and there you go now it's just black and white and full so meaning that we can unlock it now we click we unlock it and now it's full color so now it says that it's already unlocked all right so we have a very visual indicator of which skills we can unlock now let's apply the colors also to background and to all the other skills all right so here I've refactor the code in order to have the same behavior for all the buttons but not have so much code copy pasting so I created a simple class to represent a single skill button and in here we have the update visual instead of having up here for every single one then we have instances of skill button and we update our visual and then in here we receive our transform the player skills and so on so we're doing exactly the same thing but our class is now much more clean so now let's test this out and everything should be working all right here we are and yet we have a visual difference between the ones that can be unlocked and ones that are still locked so now for example let's unlock our movement speed 1 and there you go that one turned into color and now that one is available so I can unlock it yep just like that so unlock that one yep its unlock now I can unlock this one and just like that alright so here we have our lock and unlock system working awesome now let's add some lines so we can see the unlock path so first let's add them over here in the editor all right so here I have added the three lines for our three and links between the skills now let's go into our script and here let's make a class to hem all our connections inside we have filmed for the skill time and the image array for our connections and then art for this class you show up in the editor we need to add the attribute serializable okay just like that and now all the way up here let's have an array of skill unlock paths and now we can go back in the editor so here's our script and we have our skill unlock pathway so we're going to have three unlock paths so for example the first one for movement speed two and we're going to have one image which is this one in here now the same for the rest all right we have our references now we go down into the visual function and let's first make them all dark so first we darken on the links and then afterwards we go through them again so here we have the skill that is either unlocked or can be unlocked so here let's show with the gold color alright so that's about it and now here I have these two textures the normal line and line glow so let's also use that to make it even more impactful alright let's test okay so here we are and yet we can see that our links are all dark and now if i unlock this one there you go now it becomes visible so now it's much more clear that i can now unlock this one so what this one there you go it changes and it changes alright awesome okay so here we have pretty much our entire skill tree working now finally just for fun I'm going to implement the eleven system that we made previously so we can level up to get skill points that we can then use so here I've added a indicator for these skill points on the UI so here we have these skill points text and now here on the player script it already has the unlevel system and the own level system fires off an event when the own level changes so here's where we're setting the indicator for the on level text in order to see how the own level system works make sure you check out that video so here we can handle getting some skill points so let's go into our player skills in order to store a certain number of skill points and here we got a private in just a something very simple and a function to add them and on the player when the player levels up we go into our player skills and we add news comfort now on the player skills when we try to and welcome let's make sure that we have enough skill points so when you try run/walk we test if we can unlock based on the requirements then we also test if skill points are more than zero then we reduce our skill points and we unmoor all right here it is now we just need to deal with the visual for its components so like always let's make a nice event to keep our code nice and clean so you have a simple event and when we add a stem point we invoke it and we do the same when we spend one so down here when we are spinning we fire off this event alright great so now on the UI lets get that visual all right so here it is very simple when we set the player skills we subscribe to the event and we update like we always do ok so let's test ok so here we are and we currently are on level 1 so we have 0 skill points so even though technically we can unlock this skill because it has no requirements we don't have these skill points so if you try to click nope we cannot unlock it so now let's spawn some enemies and there you go hit him and one more and there you go now we need one more so let's spawn some more and there you go now we are in level 2 and yet we have one skill point so take these out and now we can try to spend it so let's click and there you go we've unlocked the whirlwind and now again we got no more skill points so let's once more enemy now let's seize the whirlwind kill them all and there you go and lots of skill points and yep they're there now unlock the earth shatter let's spawn a bunch more enemies and use the earth shattering there you go and we can walk a bunch more just like that alright so here we have our nice game loop fully working so we have a level system and a skill tree we have our skill point so we cannot spend them if we don't have them then we spawn some enemy so we go out we kill some enemies by killing some enemies we get some experience with enough experience we get and level up within level up we get some skill points with some points we can unlock new skills so you can spawn more enemies kill them get more exp more levels more skill points and spend them all on everything so just like this we have our nice skill tree with our very skills working in tandem with the unlevel system our skill tree also has previous requirements so we can make some very specific unlock paths alright so once again here it is our awesome minigame this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone as always you can download the project from the utilities forum in Tacoma com subscribe to the channel for more env tutorials post a new question haven't counts and I'll see you next time
