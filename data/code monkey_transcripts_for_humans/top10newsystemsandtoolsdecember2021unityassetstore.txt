00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for december 2021. this one is the list
00:12 - of paid systems and tools in the last
00:14 - video i already covered all the best
00:15 - three new assets so go watch that if you
00:17 - haven't seen it and in the next video i
00:20 - will be covering the top essence and
00:21 - effects let me know which one of these
00:23 - you're most interested in and i might do
00:25 - a detailed review on it as always
00:26 - there's links to the ads in the
00:27 - description and as a bonus you can use
00:29 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off
00:31 - your order also right now unity is
00:33 - having their in the veer sale there's
00:35 - over 8 000 assets on sale including many
00:37 - that i've never been discounted
00:38 - previously if you've been watching these
00:40 - asset highlight videos for the past
00:42 - couple of months and adding some things
00:43 - to your wish list chances are some of
00:45 - those are now discount and there's also
00:47 - a bunch of interesting humble bundles
00:48 - for game devs there's one with a bunch
00:50 - of courses for learning blender 3d
00:52 - modeling i'm currently going through
00:54 - these myself learning the basics
00:56 - then there's another one with tons of ui
00:58 - elements lots of sliders buttons and so
01:00 - on another one with lots of music and a
01:03 - final one with tons of sound effects
01:05 - check them all out with the links in the
01:06 - description alright so starting off with
01:08 - an interesting tool if you need some
01:10 - fluffy furry characters
01:12 - very very impressive results visually it
01:15 - looks really unique and it works on both
01:17 - desktop and mobile
01:19 - it works with any shader and your fur
01:21 - can even be slightly transparent and
01:23 - there are no zed sorting issues you can
01:25 - groom the hair in any way you want
01:27 - either with individual layers or by
01:29 - clumping them together it also supports
01:31 - olympic rooms although i have no idea
01:33 - what that means
01:34 - so if your game has some furry
01:36 - characters or maybe just some armor with
01:38 - a bunch of fur then maybe this asset can
01:40 - help add a nice bit of polish to your
01:42 - game and up next here's a really awesome
01:44 - one that i'm surprised i've never seen
01:46 - before it's called 27 slicer which is
01:49 - the same thing as a normal sprite 9
01:50 - slicer but applied to 3d if you don't
01:53 - know what is 9 slicing that is how you
01:55 - can set up your sprites in the sprite
01:57 - editor and you set it up with 9 slices
01:59 - and it automatically resizes the sprite
02:01 - to any shape and all of the corners keep
02:03 - their aspect ratio meaning that the
02:05 - sprite is never stretched in the corner
02:07 - only in the middle so it always looks
02:08 - great
02:09 - this one does exactly that but apply to
02:12 - 3d like i said a really interesting tool
02:14 - and i'm surprised this is the first time
02:15 - i'm hearing of it sounds like it would
02:17 - be extremely useful i guess maybe the
02:19 - only issue is that it's limited to
02:21 - things where this sort of resizing makes
02:22 - sense
02:23 - so it's perfect for couches tables rugs
02:26 - doors windows
02:27 - and of course it probably only looks
02:29 - good within low poly art style i
02:31 - definitely would like to try this one
02:32 - out to see how the setup works i can
02:34 - definitely see this as being extremely
02:36 - useful especially like i said if you
02:37 - have a low poly style game then if you
02:39 - want to add split screen to your games
02:41 - here's a nice tool it works perfectly
02:44 - the transition from double camera to
02:46 - single camera is really seamless
02:48 - naturally this is perfect for split
02:50 - screen multiplayer but could also work
02:52 - for a single player game where you
02:53 - control multiple units the split is
02:56 - created automatically and rotates around
02:58 - based on the camera angle
02:59 - and one of the issues with double
03:01 - cameras is of course double the
03:02 - rendering so thankfully this one also
03:04 - has a feature for automatic non-sampling
03:06 - in order to make it really performant
03:08 - even on low end devices and up next
03:10 - another super useful tool this one for
03:12 - 2d it lets you dynamically create shapes
03:15 - directly inside of unity so you place
03:18 - down some points and some curves to make
03:19 - any shape that you want
03:21 - then easily with one click you can
03:23 - generate the mesh with as much or as
03:25 - little fidelity as you need you can tint
03:27 - it with any solid color or even use a
03:29 - texture it includes an easy to use uv
03:32 - editor so you can make it look exactly
03:34 - as you want or you can even tint it with
03:36 - a gradient without having to manually
03:38 - make it texture in the end you can
03:40 - either use the mesh or convert it into a
03:42 - simple image quite a nice tool that i
03:44 - can see with tons of possible use cases
03:46 - then if you're like me and you don't
03:48 - like the process of populating a level
03:50 - then maybe this tool might help it's a
03:52 - tool to help with level building like so
03:54 - many others but what it does differently
03:56 - is it automatically finds prefabs that
03:58 - relate to whatever you currently have
04:00 - selected so if you select the tree it
04:02 - shows you all of the various trees for
04:04 - me that's always the issue i just end up
04:06 - copy pasting pretty much the same asset
04:08 - over and over again because it's really
04:09 - annoying to constantly keep finding new
04:11 - ones but with this one apparently that
04:13 - process becomes really easy
04:15 - it's got a custom inspector with a
04:17 - search function there's the ability to
04:19 - attend objects for finding them easily
04:21 - and there's even a connection to the
04:22 - asset store to help you find even
04:24 - similar assets then for another 2d tool
04:26 - here you have some digable terrain
04:29 - perfect for any side-scrolling game
04:31 - where you want to enable the player to
04:32 - build out their level so maybe a mining
04:34 - game kind of like terraria or seymour
04:37 - dig or maybe even something like worms
04:39 - you set up the terrain shape using the
04:41 - sprites you want for the film texture
04:43 - and the various edges
04:44 - then the player can easily dig in that
04:46 - area includes 9 different terrain types
04:48 - and a nice cartoony art sound then
04:50 - here's a very unique tool a transform
04:53 - changes debugger this one is meant to
04:55 - help you debug your transforms when
04:57 - they're acting weird it essentially
04:59 - hooks into all of the transform
05:01 - functions and keeps track of how it
05:03 - changed and from where those changes
05:04 - came from it's also a visual tool in
05:06 - order to make it very easy to visually
05:08 - see on all of the frames which had more
05:10 - actions than usual so at a glance you
05:12 - can probably find the issue right away
05:14 - just by seeing which frame had more
05:16 - action than it's supposed to
05:18 - this one is really a problem that i've
05:19 - never really encountered myself but if
05:21 - this happens to you then i can see this
05:23 - as being quite useful and up next if you
05:25 - have some blurry textures and no access
05:28 - to the originals or you just don't have
05:30 - it in high resolution then here's an ai
05:32 - powered resizer it does exactly what you
05:34 - expect takes your blurry low-res
05:37 - textures and upscales it using ai
05:39 - the screenshots on the store page look
05:41 - very impressive complex images and all
05:43 - of the detail is preserved in the hi-res
05:45 - version it lets you batch generate and
05:48 - override the original so with just one
05:50 - button you can instantly fix all of the
05:52 - low rest textures in your game
05:54 - the api can even be used in runtime so
05:56 - maybe if you receive some user images in
05:58 - your game you can use this to uprise
06:00 - them then here's a nice visual tool a
06:02 - stadium crowd generator you can
06:05 - dynamically generate the crowd on the
06:06 - stands use from multiple materials to
06:08 - get it looking like a football stadium
06:10 - or maybe boxing or nascar
06:12 - you control how the onions looks and
06:14 - reacts to the game you can color them
06:16 - and offset the animation to make it all
06:18 - look very natural and it's even
06:20 - optimized with gpu instancing so it's
06:22 - very performant and then if you want to
06:24 - display some gifs in your game here's a
06:26 - nice tool you might be aware that unity
06:28 - has a video player component but that
06:30 - one only works on video files so it
06:32 - cannot play gifs so this has an elms to
06:35 - solve that just one line of code to load
06:37 - any gif that give can also support alpha
06:40 - and it even supports screen recording so
06:42 - if you have some feature in your game
06:44 - kind of like a gamewin screen or some
06:46 - highlights and you want to enable the
06:48 - player to make some gifs to share them
06:49 - on social media then this one makes that
06:51 - process extremely easy it's very simple
06:54 - and does exactly what it's meant to do
06:55 - all right so those are my top 10 new
06:57 - tools and systems on the unity asset
06:59 - store for december 2021 there's links to
07:02 - on the description and as a bonus you
07:03 - can use the coupon code monkey10 to get
07:05 - ten percent off your order

07:08 - lists with free and paid assets and let
07:10 - me know if you pick up any of these and
07:11 - what you intend to do with them also

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for december 2021. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered all the best three new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top essence and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the
