00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak and
00:02 - here let's check out the top new games
00:03 - made with un launch in April 24 this was
00:05 - an interesting month there were maybe
00:07 - about 30 or 40 games that I found quite
00:09 - interesting but also a surprising amount
00:11 - of them actually had some issues and had
00:12 - mixed reviews although even without
00:14 - those it was still tricky to pick just
00:16 - 10 for this list there were plenty that
00:17 - looked interesting and were well made
00:19 - the reason why I make these videos is to
00:20 - show you everything the engine can do
00:21 - the only limit is really just your own
00:23 - skills and Imagination and the variety
00:24 - and the awesomeness of the gamees shown
00:26 - here really puts us to the test all
00:27 - these games are inly impressive so the
00:29 - list in no particular order except for
00:30 - the number one game that is my personal
00:32 - pick of the month and actually before we
00:33 - begin just an honorable mention one of
00:35 - the most and thisp game of the past few
00:37 - years is finally out manner Lords this
00:39 - one had 3 million wish lists that's more
00:41 - than most triaa games this is another
00:43 - mention simply just because it's not
00:45 - made with unity it's an unreal game but
00:47 - it looks like a very well made game it
00:49 - already has over 20,000 very positive
00:51 - views so it's definitely living up to
00:53 - the hype it's a city Builder medieval
00:54 - game with an insane amount of
00:56 - interconnected systems and the most
00:57 - impressive thing of all this was made
01:00 - sort of by a s Dev over the course of s
01:02 - years I say sort of because while it did
01:04 - start as a s Dev after a while when he
01:06 - got an epic me brand he used that money
01:08 - to hire all sorts of contractors so the
01:10 - final game is not really Soul made but
01:11 - still really impressive to guide and
01:13 - build such a massive project involving
01:15 - so many people over so many years this
01:17 - definitely likely going to end up one of
01:18 - the biggest hits of the Year by the way
01:20 - the response to my Game Dev report video
01:22 - format has been very positive those
01:24 - videos take a ton of work to make so I
01:25 - can't really produce that kind of video
01:27 - very regularly but what I can do more
01:29 - regularly is write some text so I've set
01:30 - up a newsletter you can sign up and I'll
01:32 - keep you up to date with the latest in
01:34 - Game Dev Tekken gaming also I should
01:36 - mention a really great bundle that just
01:37 - started right now you can get a mountain
01:39 - of awesome asses for just 25 bucks it
01:41 - has everything from weapons a bunch of
01:43 - survival things you've got boats
01:45 - terrains cities there's Wild West modern
01:47 - lots of melee weapons a bunch of food
01:49 - and so on so this is a really great
01:51 - model you can make an infinite amount of
01:53 - games with these assets all for just 25
01:55 - bucks or alternatively if you want
01:56 - specifically C the assets they also have
01:58 - a sale in their store right now so check
02:00 - out everything with the links in the
02:01 - description all right so starting off
02:03 - the unity games list at number 10 here
02:05 - we have content warning this was
02:07 - technically an April Fool's game but it
02:09 - is generally great the goal is to use a
02:10 - camera to film you and your friends
02:12 - doing scary things to get tons of views
02:14 - on spook tube you go onto to an
02:16 - abandoned building explore with your
02:17 - trusty camera and flashlight try to film
02:19 - as many scary things as possible without
02:21 - dying and without running out of oxygen
02:23 - or battery then if you survive you
02:25 - upload your footage to Spook tube and
02:27 - hope it gets tons of views with the add
02:29 - revenue from the video you can buy
02:30 - upgrades and equipment to be able to
02:32 - make a better video next time this is a
02:34 - really fun concept and it's the perfect
02:36 - streamer bait kind of game also very
02:38 - interesting is how they launched this
02:39 - game it came out on apron fools and was
02:41 - free for that one day then afterwards
02:43 - became a $10 paid game so even though
02:45 - they technically launch a game for free
02:46 - I'm guessing they still made a ton of
02:48 - money from it basically by making it
02:49 - free for one day and having a great game
02:51 - it got tons of players and tons of
02:53 - positive reviews which then boosts the
02:54 - game in the algorithm even after it goes
02:56 - paid definitely a very interesting
02:57 - marketing strategy I would not
02:59 - necessarily recommend you follow this
03:00 - because of how difficult it is to pull
03:02 - off but in this case clearly they found
03:03 - tons of success next up here is an
03:05 - awesome tactics game no plan B I'm
03:08 - pretty sure that I covered this one when
03:09 - it first came out into Early Access and
03:11 - now it's been fully released it's a
03:13 - tactics game where you control a team of
03:15 - SWAT and literally draw out your plans
03:17 - you tell the unit exactly where to go
03:19 - and where to aim you set up the timing
03:21 - perfectly in order to throw a flashbang
03:22 - and then do a breach afterwards you can
03:24 - use all the weapons and tools at your
03:26 - disposal to take out all the bad guys
03:28 - and complete the mission without any
03:29 - injuries now one very important thing
03:31 - about this game is you might have
03:32 - noticed these are using some very
03:34 - recognizable cinti assets like I've said
03:36 - many times you should not worry about
03:38 - using assets for fear players won't turn
03:40 - on you players really only want fun
03:41 - games to play regardless of what you use
03:43 - to build them this game is interesting
03:45 - and is fun to play so because of that
03:47 - the reviews are very positive and none
03:49 - of them mention any assets so don't be
03:51 - afraid to use assets to bring your games
03:52 - to life like I said this one is out now
03:54 - in 1.0 and it's out with over 500 very
03:57 - positive reviews this one was almost my
03:59 - personal pick for this month I love the
04:00 - mechanics and I definitely want to find
04:02 - some time to play it then here's a
04:03 - really unique one that a lot of people
04:05 - are talking about Children Of The Sun
04:07 - you play as an assassin and you have a
04:09 - special ability of controlling your
04:10 - bullets from Target to Target so it's
04:12 - actually more of a puzzle game than an
04:14 - action game you need to get the timing
04:16 - in the order right in order to jump from
04:18 - Target to Target until the final real
04:20 - Target you also have just a single
04:22 - bullet so you cannot miss because of
04:23 - that you need to scout the area before
04:25 - you fire your one and only shot visually
04:27 - the game has a very unique style it
04:29 - looks looks very trippy with tons of
04:31 - effects the story is All About escaping
04:32 - and taking revenge on some kind of
04:34 - Nefarious com definitely very strange
04:36 - very unique game people are really
04:37 - enjoying it it's got over 500 very
04:39 - positive reviews next here's a fun one
04:41 - called another crabs treasure this is a
04:44 - soulslike game where you play as a
04:45 - hermit crab these crabs usually have
04:47 - some shell or some object on their back
04:49 - and the game play very much takes that
04:51 - into account you have over 50 shells you
04:53 - can find to protect you in various ways
04:55 - it's got Souls like combat and you've
04:57 - got plenty of powerful abilities to
04:59 - learn to use in your adventure the
05:00 - trailer also has some really nice voice
05:02 - acting for the characters it almost
05:04 - makes it look kind of disney-like it
05:06 - looks like a very Charming game and
05:07 - despite being a ssik it does seem quite
05:09 - approachable it is out now with 1500
05:11 - very positive views at 94% positive up
05:14 - next we have a gorgeous looking game
05:16 - titled no rest for the wiced right away
05:18 - visually this looks really gorgeous
05:19 - super high quality very dark and Moody
05:21 - which is actually a bit odd considering
05:23 - how this is the same developer that made
05:25 - the excellent Orient the blind Forest
05:27 - it's always interesting when Studios
05:28 - make a hard turn and make something
05:30 - completely different this one is an
05:31 - action RPG a DI like game so you've got
05:34 - lots of action and lots of loot you
05:36 - equip and enchant your Armament to make
05:37 - a character build that fits your play
05:39 - style you can explore this beautiful
05:41 - handcrafted world and rest in a town
05:42 - where you can buy some property and make
05:44 - it your own then venture out and defeat
05:46 - some more enemies you can play at a solo
05:48 - or an online co-op it is out now in
05:50 - Early Access and reviews are at mostly
05:52 - positive it seems people love the combat
05:54 - but the loot and inventory management
05:56 - does seem to need some quality of life
05:57 - Improvement since it is in Early Access
05:59 - hopefully they have some time to polish
06:01 - everything before the final release next
06:02 - here's another one that just hit 1.0 the
06:05 - planet crafter this is a survival open
06:07 - world terraforming game you crash land
06:09 - on an inhospitable planet and your goal
06:11 - is to make it habitable for Humanity you
06:13 - gather all kinds of resources and start
06:15 - building build out your base from
06:17 - various modules grow some plants
06:18 - generate some oxygen generate some
06:20 - warmth and pressure in order to create a
06:22 - brand new biosphere the terraforming
06:24 - aspect for this game does look really
06:25 - awesome you start off with a Barren red
06:27 - World completely empty of life and after
06:29 - doing doing a ton of work suddenly the
06:30 - planet is luscious filled with color and
06:32 - lots of water and lots of plants the
06:34 - whole game works either Solo or up to 10
06:36 - players in Co-op which is actually a
06:38 - pretty huge amount this one is already a
06:40 - huge hit in Early Access it is out now
06:41 - in 1.0 with a total of 30,000
06:44 - overwhelmingly positive reviews at 96%
06:46 - positive that's an insane amount of
06:48 - reviews and insane positive percentage
06:50 - then for some VR here we have
06:52 - convergence it's a single player VR
06:54 - shooter with some horror elements likely
06:56 - it seems like every VR game that comes
06:58 - out is in multiplayer so it's actually
06:59 - great to find a nice single player one
07:01 - one of my favorite VR games of all time
07:03 - is Arizona sunshine and this one seems
07:05 - similar to that you scavenge this Zone
07:07 - fillmed with radiation gather some Loot
07:09 - and fight some Bandits you also have a
07:11 - trusty dog by your side to help you out
07:13 - however be sure to return to base before
07:15 - DUS Falls there's some weird creatures
07:16 - that come out at night the weapon
07:18 - mechanics look really great you can
07:19 - prepare and set up your weapon before
07:21 - going out your inventory also seems to
07:23 - have a nice physical backpack which
07:24 - looks really great one interesting thing
07:26 - is how it's actually in Early Access the
07:28 - game seems more so focused and sandbox
07:30 - which usually is not the kind of thing
07:31 - you see on Early Access but regardless
07:33 - people are really enjoying it it's got
07:35 - almost 300 very positive viws then for
07:37 - something more nice and calming here is
07:39 - Echoes of the Plum Grove this is a
07:41 - farming and life Sim game you can pick
07:43 - up some tools and start farming all
07:45 - kinds of things decide what to plant
07:47 - what to stck for the winter and who to
07:48 - be friend in this nice cozy town but
07:50 - eventually something will go wrong maybe
07:52 - some disease or some Hunger so make sure
07:54 - you grow your family tree so that once
07:56 - you perish you can pick a child and
07:58 - continue playing this like mechanic
08:00 - sounds really interesting it allows you
08:01 - to grow your farm and continue building
08:03 - it for many generations I also always
08:05 - love games with this art sound to the
08:06 - characters in a 3D World I definitely
08:08 - would like to use this style in one of
08:09 - my games someday looks really great this
08:11 - one is out now with 150 very positive
08:14 - reviews at 97% positive then here's also
08:16 - one that has been very anticipated for a
08:18 - long time infection free zone it's a
08:20 - zombie strategy defense game you control
08:22 - units set up buildings and outposts
08:24 - gather resources and build some defenses
08:26 - then at night the zombies come and you
08:28 - have to survive now the gimmick for this
08:30 - one is how you play it anywhere you want
08:32 - in the real world and supposedly it sort
08:34 - of matches so it can be a fun fantasy
08:35 - for defending from some zombie
08:37 - apocalypse in your own Hometown however
08:39 - anytime a game promises this kind of
08:41 - thing it always makes you a bit
08:42 - skeptical simply it's based on the fact
08:43 - that the real world really was not built
08:45 - for compelling game design so because
08:47 - that I'm guessing they manually handb
08:49 - build an interesting experience in the
08:50 - common places like New York Berlin Paris
08:53 - and so on but if you go into a small
08:54 - town in an unknown country I doubt the
08:56 - experience won't be as good but maybe
08:58 - I'm wrong about that maybe the game is
08:59 - indeed great literally anywhere on earth
09:01 - now interestingly enough this game only
09:03 - has mostly positive reviews just barely
09:05 - on the 70% mark this is surprising given
09:08 - how the prologue had 90% positive
09:10 - reviews the main negative seem to be
09:12 - lack of quality of life improvements
09:13 - lots of clicking and repetitive looting
09:15 - but it is only in Early Access and the
09:17 - base does seem solid so maybe when hits
09:19 - 1.0 it won be a really nice experience
09:21 - and at number one for my personal pick
09:23 - of the month here is russy's retirement
09:25 - this is an idle game where you farm and
09:27 - build a nice Town however importantly
09:29 - this sits at the bottom of your screen
09:30 - while you do something else I think this
09:32 - is an awesome gimmick for the ult genre
09:34 - usually when I play ult games I keep it
09:36 - open on my second monitor so putting it
09:38 - on the bottom of the main window is a
09:40 - genius idea it even also works on super
09:42 - wi resolutions like 21 by9 or even in
09:45 - vertical mode you can grow crops you can
09:47 - produce some biofuel automate it with
09:49 - robots and just enjoy watching your
09:50 - characters and your robots live their
09:52 - life and then something that actually
09:54 - was surprising to me I actually
09:55 - mentioned this game in a previous video
09:56 - of mine they say how the game actually
09:58 - got started when they saw my Unity
09:59 - transparent tutorial this makes me
10:01 - really happy I love seeing how people
10:03 - learn things from my tutorials and then
10:04 - build some awesome games like this one
10:06 - and find tons of success the game is out
10:08 - now and people really love it it's
10:09 - already got over, 1500 overwhelmingly
10:11 - positive views at 97% positive that's
10:14 - really awesome all right so that's 10
10:16 - awesome new games made with un launch in
10:17 - April 24 I hope this list helped you see
10:19 - how the UN engine is capable of building
10:21 - anything the limits are really just your
10:23 - own skills and Imagination check out my
10:24 - own game than Guardians and I hope you
10:26 - enjoy playing it

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak and here let's check out the top new games made with un launch in April 24 this was an interesting month there were maybe about 30 or 40 games that I found quite interesting but also a surprising amount of them actually had some issues and had mixed reviews although even without those it was still tricky to pick just 10 for this list there were plenty that looked interesting and were well made the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the gamees shown here really puts us to the test all these games are inly impressive so the list in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month and actually before we begin just an honorable mention one of the most and thisp game of the past few years is finally out manner Lords this one had 3 million wish lists that's more than most triaa games this is another mention simply just because it's not made with unity it's an unreal game but it looks like a very well made game it already has over 20,000 very positive views so it's definitely living up to the hype it's a city Builder medieval game with an insane amount of interconnected systems and the most impressive thing of all this was made sort of by a s Dev over the course of s years I say sort of because while it did start as a s Dev after a while when he got an epic me brand he used that money to hire all sorts of contractors so the final game is not really Soul made but still really impressive to guide and build such a massive project involving so many people over so many years this definitely likely going to end up one of the biggest hits of the Year by the way the response to my Game Dev report video format has been very positive those videos take a ton of work to make so I can't really produce that kind of video very regularly but what I can do more regularly is write some text so I've set up a newsletter you can sign up and I'll keep you up to date with the latest in Game Dev Tekken gaming also I should mention a really great bundle that just started right now you can get a mountain of awesome asses for just 25 bucks it has everything from weapons a bunch of survival things you've got boats terrains cities there's Wild West modern lots of melee weapons a bunch of food and so on so this is a really great model you can make an infinite amount of games with these assets all for just 25 bucks or alternatively if you want specifically C the assets they also have a sale in their store right now so check out everything with the links in the description all right so starting off the unity games list at number 10 here we have content warning this was technically an April Fool's game but it is generally great the goal is to use a camera to film you and your friends doing scary things to get tons of views on spook tube you go onto to an abandoned building explore with your trusty camera and flashlight try to film as many scary things as possible without dying and without running out of oxygen or battery then if you survive you upload your footage to Spook tube and hope it gets tons of views with the add revenue from the video you can buy upgrades and equipment to be able to make a better video next time this is a really fun concept and it's the perfect streamer bait kind of game also very interesting is how they launched this game it came out on apron fools and was free for that one day then afterwards became a $10 paid game so even though they technically launch a game for free I'm guessing they still made a ton of money from it basically by making it free for one day and having a great game it got tons of players and tons of positive reviews which then boosts the game in the algorithm even after it goes paid definitely a very interesting marketing strategy I would not necessarily recommend you follow this because of how difficult it is to pull off but in this case clearly they found tons of success next up here is an awesome tactics game no plan B I'm pretty sure that I covered this one when it first came out into Early Access and now it's been fully released it's a tactics game where you control a team of SWAT and literally draw out your plans you tell the unit exactly where to go and where to aim you set up the timing perfectly in order to throw a flashbang and then do a breach afterwards you can use all the weapons and tools at your disposal to take out all the bad guys and complete the mission without any injuries now one very important thing about this game is you might have noticed these are using some very recognizable cinti assets like I've said many times you should not worry about using assets for fear players won't turn on you players really only want fun games to play regardless of what you use to build them this game is interesting and is fun to play so because of that the reviews are very positive and none of them mention any assets so don't be afraid to use assets to bring your games to life like I said this one is out now in 1.0 and it's out with over 500 very positive reviews this one was almost my personal pick for this month I love the mechanics and I definitely want to find some time to play it then here's a really unique one that a lot of people are talking about Children Of The Sun you play as an assassin and you have a special ability of controlling your bullets from Target to Target so it's actually more of a puzzle game than an action game you need to get the timing in the order right in order to jump from Target to Target until the final real Target you also have just a single bullet so you cannot miss because of that you need to scout the area before you fire your one and only shot visually the game has a very unique style it looks looks very trippy with tons of effects the story is All About escaping and taking revenge on some kind of Nefarious com definitely very strange very unique game people are really enjoying it it's got over 500 very positive reviews next here's a fun one called another crabs treasure this is a soulslike game where you play as a hermit crab these crabs usually have some shell or some object on their back and the game play very much takes that into account you have over 50 shells you can find to protect you in various ways it's got Souls like combat and you've got plenty of powerful abilities to learn to use in your adventure the trailer also has some really nice voice acting for the characters it almost makes it look kind of disneylike it looks like a very Charming game and despite being a ssik it does seem quite approachable it is out now with 1500 very positive views at 94% positive up next we have a gorgeous looking game titled no rest for the wiced right away visually this looks really gorgeous super high quality very dark and Moody which is actually a bit odd considering how this is the same developer that made the excellent Orient the blind Forest it's always interesting when Studios make a hard turn and make something completely different this one is an

out now with 150 very positive reviews at 97% positive then here's also one that has been very anticipated for a long time infection free zone it's a zombie strategy defense game you control units set up buildings and outposts gather resources and build some defenses then at night the zombies come and you have to survive now the gimmick for this one is how you play it anywhere you want in the real world and supposedly it sort of matches so it can be a fun fantasy for defending from some zombie apocalypse in your own Hometown however anytime a game promises this kind of thing it always makes you a bit skeptical simply it's based on the fact that the real world really was not built for compelling game design so because that I'm guessing they manually handb build an interesting experience in the common places like New York Berlin Paris and so on but if you go into a small town in an unknown country I doubt the experience won't be as good but maybe I'm wrong about that maybe the game is indeed great literally anywhere on earth now interestingly enough this game only has mostly positive reviews just barely on the 70% mark this is surprising given how the prologue had 90% positive reviews the main negative seem to be lack of quality of life improvements lots of clicking and repetitive looting but it is only in Early Access and the base does seem solid so maybe when hits 1.0 it won be a really nice experience and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is russy's retirement this is an idle game where you farm and build a nice Town however importantly this sits at the bottom of your screen while you do something else I think this is an awesome gimmick for the ult genre usually when I play ult games I keep it open on my second monitor so putting it on the bottom of the main window is a genius idea it even also works on super wi resolutions like 21 by9 or even in vertical mode you can grow crops you can produce some biofuel automate it with robots and just enjoy watching your characters and your robots live their life and then something that actually was surprising to me I actually mentioned this game in a previous video of mine they say how the game actually got started when they saw my Unity transparent tutorial this makes me really happy I love seeing how people learn things from my tutorials and then build some awesome games like this one and find tons of success the game is out now and people really love it it's already got over, 1500 overwhelmingly positive views at 97% positive that's really awesome all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with un launch in April 24 I hope this list helped you see how the UN engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own game than Guardians and I hope you enjoy playing it
