00:00 - quick question about two months ago I
00:01 - made a video on a practical plan for you
00:03 - to make your very first game that plan
00:06 - was to First work on a small scope
00:07 - project then to quickly set up a steam
00:09 - coming soon page and the third step this
00:12 - one was right now in October during the
00:13 - steam nextfest to publish your free demo
00:16 - so now that we are in October and the
00:17 - next Fest is currently running my
00:19 - question is did you follow this plan I
00:20 - already asked this question to patreon
00:22 - and YouTube members so now I'm asking
00:24 - all of you if you follow this plan and
00:26 - you have a demo out right now let me
00:27 - know YouTube doesn't like it when people
00:29 - post link in the comments so instead of
00:31 - a direct link just post the name of your
00:32 - game and I'll find it on Steam over the
00:34 - weekend I'm going to play through them
00:35 - and then make a video with my thoughts
00:37 - hopefully that should be very useful for
00:39 - the developer but also super useful for
00:40 - anyone watching there's a lot of things
00:42 - about game design that are very much
00:43 - Universal watching an analysis of one
00:45 - game can also help you in your own game
00:47 - and by the way the general advice is to
00:49 - keep your game demo up even after the
00:50 - festival that way YouTubers have a bit
00:52 - more time to find your demo and play it
00:54 - and of course in my specific case
00:56 - depending on how many games people post
00:57 - I might not be able to play through all
00:59 - of them before Monday all right so
01:00 - that's it super quick video I'm looking
01:02 - forward to playing through all of your
01:03 - games thanks for watching and I'll see
01:05 - you next time
