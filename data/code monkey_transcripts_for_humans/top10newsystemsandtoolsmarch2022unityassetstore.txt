00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the assessor is full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for march 22. this one is the list of
00:11 - paid systems and tools in the last video
00:13 - i already covered the best three new
00:15 - assets so go watch it if you haven't
00:16 - seen it and in the next video i will be
00:18 - covering the top passes and effects as
00:20 - always there's links to the ads in the
00:21 - description as a bonus you can use the
00:23 - coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent
00:24 - off your order also this month i just
00:26 - published my second free asset it's a
00:28 - health system just like i've used in so
00:30 - many videos it's super easy to use and
00:32 - all of the code is set up in a really
00:34 - nice clean way the asset also includes a
00:36 - code walkthrough video where i go
00:37 - through all the code step by step it's
00:39 - free so check it out and maybe use it in
00:41 - your next project and there's also a
00:43 - sale active on the store right now it
00:45 - has a time travel theme and a bonus
00:47 - coupon for an extra 10 off there's quite
00:49 - a bunch of interesting assets on this
00:51 - sale for example the all-in-one vfx
00:53 - toolkit this one is excellent it's from
00:54 - the same developer as the all-in-one
00:56 - sprite shader that i covered in a review
00:58 - then if you need more cinti assets over
01:00 - here is a really nice modular fantasy
01:01 - hero you have a complete game template
01:03 - for making a colony simulator there are
01:05 - some portals some fog a nice shader
01:07 - effect and a bunch more stuff so check
01:09 - out the sale and see if anything you're
01:11 - interested in is currently this gun
01:12 - alright so starting off with one that
01:14 - looks great and it's actually pretty
01:15 - cheap it's an arcade vehicle physics
01:17 - pack for me i've only done a bit of work
01:20 - with racing games i made a game jam
01:22 - quite a long time ago trying to build a
01:24 - working car that felt good to drive was
01:26 - actually pretty tricky so i just made
01:28 - something that was extremely simple so
01:30 - for me this one looks great the vehicle
01:32 - wobbles you've got some tire marks some
01:33 - smoke and definitely looks like it feels
01:35 - very arcadey and the price is really
01:38 - cheap so if you need a car controller
01:39 - then maybe get this one up next an
01:42 - interesting one a sensor toolkit this
01:44 - one is a collection of sensor components
01:46 - to detect various objects and sense the
01:48 - world around them
01:49 - basically it's a collection of tools for
01:51 - object detection uses many sensor types
01:54 - uses raycast volumetric light of sight
01:56 - and more works in both 2d and 3d and
01:59 - this one is version 2 with tons of
02:01 - positive reviews so it looks like a
02:03 - really well-built asset and if you're
02:05 - working in vr and you want to rig your
02:07 - character and look at this one
02:08 - personally i haven't done any vr work
02:11 - but i imagine handling correct grab
02:12 - points is quite tricky which seems to be
02:14 - what this one is doing there are several
02:16 - of these interaction toolkits around
02:18 - again i'm not familiar with vr
02:20 - development so i'm not sure what's
02:21 - unique about this one but it does seem
02:22 - very complete it lets you grab objects
02:25 - in any way in any axes
02:27 - throw them with physics trigger some
02:29 - buttons open some drawers or use some
02:31 - levers grab and use some weapons and so
02:33 - on and somewhat related to that but not
02:36 - necessarily here is a fully working
02:38 - in-game keyboard naturally this is
02:40 - perfect for vr so you can type anything
02:42 - without needing to actually use an
02:44 - actual keyboard but this one can be also
02:46 - extremely useful for gamepad focused
02:48 - games where you want the player to be
02:49 - able to write some text or really just
02:51 - input their name again without needing a
02:53 - keyboard
02:54 - it's got all the keys symbols numbers
02:56 - and even some text emojis it includes
02:58 - various visual looks so you can make it
02:59 - fit your game then if your game is meant
03:02 - to have some realistic bullets look at
03:04 - this one you define the force and
03:06 - penetration of your bullets and how
03:08 - resistance each material is and you fire
03:10 - the bullet
03:11 - maybe it will go through ten pieces of
03:13 - wood but only two pieces of metal it
03:15 - includes ricochets some trajectory
03:17 - prediction you can easily set up the
03:19 - projectile curves and it even supports
03:21 - the coriolis effect on top of all that
03:23 - it even says that this one is multiplier
03:25 - ready so tons of options if you're
03:27 - working on a game where realism is key
03:29 - up next here's a possibly very useful
03:31 - one it's a final browser that works
03:34 - directly in game
03:35 - super useful for loading images or maybe
03:37 - some mod files or really just finding a
03:39 - save folder
03:41 - interestingly this one does not use any
03:43 - windows dll so you could get it working
03:45 - on mac and linux although apparently
03:46 - that requires some work this one is
03:48 - useful for games like i said for example
03:50 - locating mod files but perhaps even more
03:53 - useful if you're working on any kind of
03:55 - non-game application built with unity
03:57 - then if you have a 2d game and you want
03:59 - to simulate some wind look at this one
04:02 - basically applies a force around a
04:03 - certain area you can make the wind as
04:06 - strong or as weak as you like make it
04:08 - push up right down on any direction you
04:11 - can also make it interact with the unity
04:13 - particle system it's very easy to use
04:15 - since it works directly with all of the
04:16 - physics city components you really just
04:18 - drag the prefab and watch the one and up
04:20 - next here's a really unique one it's a
04:22 - tool for measuring and resizing objects
04:25 - based on real world units
04:27 - it extends the built-in transform
04:28 - component to provide fields for
04:30 - real-world units you can use metric or
04:33 - imperial so it's a simple tool that does
04:35 - exactly what you want could be very
04:37 - useful if your game relies heavily on
04:39 - some extremely precise measurements then
04:41 - over here we have a tool for making
04:43 - bridges in seconds
04:44 - first you just make your terrain as
04:46 - normal then you just click to add the
04:48 - points to make the main bridge shape
04:50 - then play around the materials the width
04:52 - whether you want an arch or not and so
04:54 - on it automatically modifies the terrain
04:56 - removes the trees and does everything
04:58 - and the final result looks really good
05:00 - so if you build your environments and
05:01 - then realize you need to change some
05:03 - things around then a tool like this one
05:04 - to dynamically make some bridges can be
05:06 - a real time saver and finally another
05:09 - interesting one you've got a javascript
05:11 - console you open up a console with a key
05:13 - then easily type in any javascript to
05:15 - interact with the world so you can move
05:17 - some objects you can spawn them change
05:19 - some materials change gravity and so on
05:21 - even though it's named javascript it's
05:23 - not literally javascript it's actually
05:25 - written in p or c sharp so with no
05:27 - plugins or no dlls
05:29 - it's definitely a niche tool but if you
05:31 - want a quick console and you're already
05:33 - familiar with javascript then can be
05:34 - quite useful alright so those are my top
05:37 - 10 new tools and systems on the unity
05:38 - assessor for march 22. there's links to
05:41 - on the description and as a bonus you
05:42 - can use the coupon code monkey10 to get
05:44 - 10 off your order check out the phone
05:46 - playlist to see some more lists with
05:48 - free and paid assets and let me know if
05:49 - you pick up any of these and what you
05:50 - intend to do them also check out my own
05:52 - free and paid ads on the store
05:54 - alright hope that's useful check out
05:56 - these videos to learn some more thanks
05:58 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
06:00 - making these videos possible thank you
06:02 - for watching and i'll see you next time

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for march 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered the best three new assets so go watch it if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top passes and effects as always there's links to the ads in the description as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order also this month i just published my second free asset it's a health system just like i've used in so many videos it's super easy to use and all of the code is set up in a really nice clean way the asset
