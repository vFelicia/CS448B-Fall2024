00:07 - also quite varied which is a great
00:09 - showcase for just how powerful and
00:11 - versatile unity can be
00:13 - i started by looking on the upcoming
00:14 - steam page and did some research to
00:16 - identify which ones are being made with
00:18 - unity
00:19 - so the order is based on number of
00:20 - wishlists so let's begin starting off
00:22 - with number 10 where we have spacebase
00:24 - sartopia
00:25 - this is a sequel slash remake to
00:27 - startopia which is a very bollocks game
00:29 - from 20 years ago
00:31 - it's a simulation management game where
00:33 - you run a space base with tons of
00:34 - inhabitants
00:35 - you need to keep them happy make sure
00:37 - your base runs smoothly and make a
00:39 - profit
00:39 - there's also combat with competitors and
00:41 - space pirates
00:43 - features an extensive single player
00:44 - campaign a configurable sandbox mode as
00:47 - well as competitive and cooperative
00:48 - multiplayer
00:49 - i've never actually played the original
00:51 - despite leaving the genre and hearing
00:53 - tons of good things about it so
00:54 - personally i'm looking forward to this
00:55 - one
00:56 - next up at number 9 is 12 minutes this
00:59 - is a very unique game with an
01:00 - interesting premise

01:14 - marketing for this game has been
01:15 - excellent every trailer they release
01:17 - just uses mystery and suspense
01:19 - then at number eight we've got ruined
01:21 - king on league of legends story
01:23 - this one is notable due to the fact that
01:25 - a massive studio like riot chose unity
01:27 - as opposed to making their own engine
01:29 - league of legends is massive and this is
01:31 - just one of the several games i have

04:03 - new nice entry on the management genre
04:05 - so i really hope it's well executed

04:09 - honor 2 sovereign
04:10 - this is a fresh take on the real-time
04:13 - grand strategy

04:22 - taking direct control commanding your
04:24 - units in an rts style battles

04:30 - inside unity
04:31 - it promises accessible grand strategy
04:33 - with enough depth
04:34 - with religion diplomacy city and more
