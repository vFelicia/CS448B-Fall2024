00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a very pleasant surprise that
00:03 - i totally wasn't expecting an extremely
00:05 - excellent bundle all about cinti assets
00:07 - they are in their low poly signature
00:09 - style and being a humble bundle means
00:11 - that as an insane discount you can get
00:13 - them at 96 off so this bundle to me is a
00:16 - no-brainer as you may know i'm a big fan
00:18 - of the low-poly style they already have
00:20 - quite a lot of cindy packs and yet i
00:21 - didn't have many of these so i picked
00:23 - that up right away there's a massive
00:25 - amount of variety here you have tons of
00:27 - characters some zombies some city
00:29 - characters fantasy and more then you
00:31 - have several massive packs which also
00:33 - have many more characters
00:35 - you've got an off spec i've been looking
00:37 - at this one for a while looks perfect
00:38 - for many kind of tycoon games then the
00:41 - sci-fi pack just this one is worth over
00:43 - a hundred dollars by itself it has over
00:45 - 600 assets
00:47 - then the town pack really nice and cozy
00:50 - the farm pack would be perfect for any
00:52 - kind of farming simulator game or maybe
00:53 - something like stardew valley
00:55 - the pirate pack has lots of pirates and
00:57 - some gorgeous ships
00:59 - the prototype pack this one is great
01:01 - with lots of variety i'm actually using
01:02 - this one for an upcoming mini game
01:04 - then you have the spy kit with a
01:06 - gorgeous car and lots of gadgets and the
01:08 - polygon explorer perfect for any kind of
01:10 - indiana jones inspired game
01:12 - so as you can see it's a massive bundle
01:14 - with thousands of objects thousands of
01:16 - prefabs for an insanely cheap price so
01:18 - it's worth it for just a single one of
01:20 - these
01:21 - so unless you absolutely hate this style
01:23 - or you already have all of these then i
01:24 - would highly recommend you pick this up
01:26 - the amount of unique game genres you can
01:28 - build from this bundle is just insane
01:30 - also i recently made a video on games
01:32 - using assets where i found some games on
01:34 - steam that were very clearly using
01:36 - assets and specifically cinti assets and
01:38 - i checked out their player reviews and
01:40 - looking at those no one cares that the
01:42 - game uses assets all the players want
01:44 - all they care about is that the game is
01:45 - good
01:46 - so if you're the kind of person who
01:48 - refuses to buy assets because you're
01:49 - afraid the players will call you lazy or
01:51 - a cheater or something like that if
01:53 - that's how you think then go check out
01:54 - that video and see how all that matters
01:56 - is really if the game is good so yeah
01:59 - for me this was a very pleasant surprise
02:00 - i definitely got it right away i'm
02:02 - thinking an interesting video would be
02:04 - to make some mini games with these packs
02:05 - so let me know if you'd like to see
02:06 - something like that and of course the
02:08 - link in the description is also an
02:09 - affiliate link so if you pick it up
02:11 - through there you get some awesome
02:12 - assets for all of your projects and i
02:14 - get a nice commission
02:15 - so thanks for watching i really hope you
02:17 - like these assets and you put them to
02:19 - good use and i'll see you next time
