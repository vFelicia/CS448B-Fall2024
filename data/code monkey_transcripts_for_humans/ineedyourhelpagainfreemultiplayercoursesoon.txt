00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and first of all let me say thank you
00:04 - all so much the last time that I asked
00:06 - for your help all of you really helped
00:07 - the free course video is easily my best
00:09 - performing video getting over 300 000
00:11 - views in the first month that's all
00:13 - thanks to your help so thank you all so
00:14 - much I generally hope you have enjoyed
00:17 - the course and it has helped you on your
00:18 - own Game Dev Journey it has over 20 000
00:20 - likes and 3 000 comments I've answered
00:22 - as many comments and questions as I
00:23 - could
00:24 - like I mentioned in that video that
00:26 - course is really just part one making
00:27 - that complete game in single player and
00:29 - now I'm almost done with the second part
00:31 - which is adding multiplayer to the game
00:33 - I'm still editing and finishing up some
00:35 - things but the plan is for the
00:36 - multiplayer course to come out next
00:37 - Monday so the way I need your help is
00:39 - the same as before when you see this
00:40 - video in your YouTube timeline or
00:42 - suggested videos go ahead click on it
00:44 - right away then hit the like button and
00:46 - watch the video that's it if enough
00:48 - people do that then YouTube won't push
00:49 - that video so that tons of people can
00:51 - learn how to make multiplayer games
00:53 - here's an overview of everything we're
00:54 - going to do throughout the entire course
00:56 - so first we will Begin by taking a brief
00:59 - look at the starting game this is what
01:01 - was made commonly from scratch in the
01:02 - ceiling Point course so here we're just
01:04 - going to do a quick overview as a
01:06 - refresher to see how all the code is set
01:07 - out then we're going to begin by
01:09 - installing netcode for game objects this
01:11 - is unity's official multiplier solution
01:12 - we're going to install the package into
01:14 - the basic setup with all of these
01:16 - settings and spawn a player object after
01:18 - that we're going to begin by
01:19 - synchronizing the player movement and
01:22 - also at this point we're going to talk
01:23 - about one extremely important thing in
01:25 - multiplayer games which is server
01:26 - authoritative versus client
01:28 - authoritative with the movement synced
01:30 - we are then going to synchronize the
01:31 - animations this one is pretty simple to
01:33 - do thanks to the built-in components
01:35 - next we're going to synchronize our
01:37 - first proper gameplay logic we're going
01:39 - to begin with the delivery manager so
01:42 - we're going to synchronize how the
01:43 - recipes are spawned make sure only the
01:45 - server spawns them and all the clients
01:47 - see the same list and also synchronize
01:49 - delivering the recipes either correctly
01:51 - or incorrectly after that is just a
01:53 - quick make sure to fix the sunlight that
01:54 - counter visual this is something that
01:56 - showcases one of the many differences
01:58 - between making single player games and
01:59 - multiplayer games we need to think in
02:02 - different ways especially because in
02:03 - multiplayer we no longer have just a
02:05 - single player object then we're going to
02:07 - synchronize picking up objects this
02:09 - involves learning how to spawn objects
02:11 - on the network so that all of the
02:12 - players can see it after learning how to
02:14 - spawn them we're going to synchronize
02:15 - the kitchen object parent so that
02:17 - multiple players can hold objects and
02:19 - everything is correctly synchronized
02:20 - across the network then we're going to
02:22 - synchronize the plates counter make it
02:24 - so that only the server responds points
02:26 - then for the trash counter this one
02:28 - involves learning how to destroy Network
02:30 - objects after that is synchronizing the
02:33 - cutting counter so this one will involve
02:35 - thinking about what parts we need to
02:36 - synchronize and what logic can be just
02:38 - local then for the stove counter for
02:40 - this one instead of using rpcs we're
02:42 - actually going to use a network variable
02:44 - the server won't keep track of the stove
02:46 - State and sync it to the clients next is
02:48 - synchronizing the logic for adding
02:50 - ingredients onto the plates after that
02:52 - for an optional design question we're
02:54 - going to implement some player
02:55 - collisions then we're going to
02:57 - synchronize the complete Game State SO
02:59 - waiting for all of the players to be
03:01 - ready before starting the game and also
03:03 - synchronize the game timer and game over
03:04 - next we're going to learn how to deal
03:06 - with pausing so do we unlock it or not
03:08 - in this case we are going to allow it
03:10 - and all of the other players must wait
03:12 - until everyone is unpaused then for
03:14 - something very important which is how do
03:16 - we handle disconnects how do we clean up
03:18 - all the objects so the game doesn't
03:19 - crash when a player leaves in the middle
03:21 - related to that are only joins so how do
03:24 - we handle a player that joined after the
03:26 - game has already started or should we
03:27 - even allow that then comes a really
03:29 - important and relatively complex lecture
03:31 - in this one we're going to handle the
03:33 - complete connection scene flow how we
03:35 - begin in the main menu in single player
03:37 - then we have an online lobby after that
03:39 - we create a netcode connection and go
03:41 - into the character select scene then
03:43 - when all the players are ready we then
03:45 - go into the main game scene and after
03:47 - that just play the game as normal this
03:49 - is one of the most important lectures in
03:50 - this entire course after that with the
03:52 - connection from working we're going to
03:54 - build out a nice character select scene
03:55 - this is one of the main things that I
03:57 - saw people ask about in my netcode video
03:59 - so we're going to make a nice scene
04:00 - where the players can join and customize
04:02 - their character next we're going to
04:04 - build the game lobbying so the player
04:05 - can create a Lobby or Join one then
04:08 - we're going to implement relay in order
04:09 - to allow our players to connect to one
04:11 - another easily without having to open
04:12 - ports next we're going to talk about
04:14 - some more yinty multiplayer Tunes
04:16 - dedicated servers with game server
04:18 - hosting Matchmaker and vvox after that
04:21 - we're going to talk a bit about all of
04:22 - the tools at your disposal to test your
04:24 - multiplayer games then just before the
04:26 - end we're also going to add a really
04:28 - important option we want the game to
04:29 - work in both multiplayer and single
04:31 - player so we're going to make it so you
04:33 - can basically bypass all the multiplayer
04:35 - connections and play in an offline
04:36 - single player mode and with that
04:38 - everything is done so we're going to
04:39 - inspect the funnel game and have some
04:41 - fun okay so that's a course as you can
04:43 - see it involves tons of things related
04:45 - to multiplayer it involves synchronizing
04:47 - tons of data handling scene management
04:48 - learning about rpcs Network variables
04:51 - how to handle disconnects reconnects how
04:53 - to make a character selection scene use
04:55 - Unity Lobby really and so on it's a very
04:58 - complete multiplayer game and again
05:00 - everything step by step if you haven't
05:01 - yet seen the easy on player course then
05:03 - go ahead and watch that this multiplayer
05:05 - course starts off exactly where the
05:06 - single player course ended there's no
05:08 - code that was written off screen and if
05:10 - you have seen it then you can go watch
05:12 - my netcode for game objects video in
05:13 - order to prepare for the multiplayer
05:15 - course basically the course is
05:16 - structured the same way as the single
05:18 - player course
05:19 - meaning I assume you are familiar with
05:21 - the basics so in there I assume you know
05:23 - how net code for game objects works I
05:25 - will explain things as I use them but I
05:27 - will assume you know the basics like
05:29 - what is a network manager Network object
05:31 - rpcs and so on this has been a ton of
05:33 - work so I really hope it helps you
05:35 - achieve your dreams of making a
05:36 - multiplayer game personally I'm
05:38 - definitely looking forward to having
05:39 - some more calm days next week I've been
05:40 - working non-stop on these two courses
05:42 - for so many months now just like with
05:44 - the Singapore course I'm also making
05:45 - this one a complete free course I want
05:47 - everyone who wants to learn how to make
05:48 - multiplayer games to be able to do so in
05:51 - order to reach as many people as
05:52 - possible I just need your help to click
05:53 - like and watch the video hopefully this
05:55 - one will also do very well in the
05:57 - YouTube algorithm and beyond that also
05:59 - just like the cylinder course this
06:00 - multiplayer portion is also commonly
06:02 - free although I will also make it a
06:03 - regular course on my website but I want
06:05 - to be very very clear there's absolutely
06:07 - no difference between the free and paid
06:08 - version both have exactly the same
06:10 - content so there's absolutely nothing
06:11 - behind any pay one I just made that just
06:14 - in case some of you find the course
06:15 - helpful and you'd like to support
06:16 - directly and of course the YouTube video
06:19 - has regular YouTube ads whereas the paid
06:20 - version has no ads but on the content
06:22 - itself all of that is exactly the same
06:24 - so consider that donation if you can
06:26 - afford it and if you really like the
06:28 - course alright so once again thank you
06:30 - all so much for your help with the
06:31 - Singapore course I really hope you liked
06:32 - it and I hope you will also learn a ton
06:34 - from the multiplayer course stay tuned
06:36 - for the video coming out next Monday and
06:38 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and first of all let me say thank you all so much the last time that I asked for your help all of you really helped the free course video is easily my best performing video getting over 300 000 views in the first month that's all thanks to your help so thank you all so much I generally hope you have enjoyed the course and it has helped you on your own Game Dev Journey it has over 20 000 likes and 3 000 comments I've answered as many comments and questions as I could like I mentioned in that video that course is really just part one making that complete game in single player and now I'm almost done with the second part which is adding multiplayer to the game I'm still editing and finishing up some things but the plan is for the multiplayer course to come out next Monday so the way I need your help is the same as before when you see this video in your YouTube timeline or suggested videos go ahead click on it right away then hit the like button and watch the video that's it if enough people do that then YouTube won't push that video so that tons of people can learn how to make multiplayer games here's an overview of everything we're
