With timestamps:

03:54 - all right hey everyone how's it going
03:55 - thanks for being here all right
03:59 - okay let me make sure everything is
04:01 - working make sure the steam
04:03 - is working
04:08 - all right I forgot one thing
04:12 - uh
04:28 - crap forgot this uh
04:32 - all right just
04:41 - okay I think it's working all right
05:00 - okay great all right
05:03 - okay so I was just missing this window
05:05 - all right
05:06 - okay so hey everyone how's it going
05:10 - thanks for being here at 4 pm in the
05:12 - afternoon or whatever it is your time
05:16 - just minimize everything and okay all
05:18 - right
05:20 - okay
05:21 - right so basically I'm gonna be working
05:24 - on the game trying to make a bit of
05:25 - progress trying to make the next update
05:27 - for the demo and yeah at the same time
05:30 - trying to answer some questions
05:30 - something so let's see
05:33 - wait is this
05:35 - might oh right it's just my my thing
05:38 - wasn't live okay
05:40 - yeah I think everything is good okay
05:42 - great
05:45 - all right
05:50 - what is your OS I'm on Windows pretty
05:53 - much always use Windows I've never
05:54 - actually used the Mac I've only used it
05:57 - like for five minutes trying to make a a
06:00 - iOS build for something yeah yeah pretty
06:04 - much always using Windows okay so
06:06 - basically the main thing that I would
06:07 - like to do is something that it's still
06:10 - not implemented in the demo which is
06:13 - over here the goal so basically I need
06:15 - to add a bunch of logic to track all of
06:18 - the various gongs so clone 30 dinkies
06:20 - build the rocket fully automate The
06:22 - Colony and keep the colony safe
06:24 - so pretty much automating those goals
06:26 - that is kind of thing that I'm going to
06:28 - want to do all right
06:40 - happy birthday okay happy birthday koyan
06:43 - hey that's nice
06:45 - I hope that helps all right okay okay so
06:49 - let me get to this so first thing I'm
06:51 - going to need some kind of goal manager
06:54 - all right
06:55 - let me make an empty game object
06:59 - for the gold manager
07:02 - and uh just wait for it to compile
07:05 - nice pen Springs I pretty much only know
07:07 - one or two tricks by now
07:10 - most of them I've kind of Forgotten with
07:12 - the ears but yeah it's fun to keep the
07:15 - brain occupied or rather keep the hands
07:17 - occupied instead of the thing use the
07:20 - unity only why do you mean
07:22 - yeah I'm using regular Yin Ty I'm not
07:24 - using UI toolkit so that one as far as I
07:27 - know actually I haven't kept up with the
07:30 - updates on that one for quite a while
07:31 - but I think that by now it is still only
07:34 - uh editor only or maybe it already has
07:38 - I'm not sure but yeah I am using just
07:40 - regular Unity so all of these these are
07:43 - all of my UI windows for demo so all of
07:46 - them separated and all these are
07:47 - basically just images buttons all of it
07:50 - super basic
07:52 - when will the new Dodge theorem be
07:54 - available uh I don't know I still have
07:56 - to go research that so hopefully
07:58 - sometime next month that's kind of the
08:00 - it's kind of gone that's what I'm going
08:02 - to try to do okay so uh for the gold
08:06 - manager all right so I'm going to
08:09 - okay so first thing let me actually keep
08:11 - track of the dinky amount
08:14 - uh
08:17 - so update visual actually do I go with
08:20 - the visual maybe not
08:22 - Jiffy is a measurement of time is it
08:27 - all right
08:29 - so fast in writing code I mean that's
08:31 - just spending many many years uh typing
08:34 - things that kind of
08:36 - that kind of has that effect okay
08:40 - uh right so I'm trying to think because
08:42 - I should probably have a visual and one
08:45 - so how am I going to have
08:48 - I guess it's I have like a private end
08:51 - for the denki amount
08:54 - uh gone do I call it go maybe
08:58 - so kind of like this equals 30.
09:01 - um
09:03 - red ball has built rocket
09:08 - well
09:10 - for the
09:11 - uh is Colony for the automated
09:17 - and let's get going for actually I'm
09:20 - trying to Define these but I should
09:23 - probably just yeah first thing I need to
09:25 - actually
09:27 - okay so let me think how am I how am I
09:29 - going to do this
09:34 - finish the signal player kitchen course
09:35 - in one hour
09:37 - you finish it in one hour
09:39 - you watch a 10 hour video in one hour
09:41 - okay I mean that's impressive so all
09:43 - right
09:45 - okay so up here I think I'm going to
09:47 - listen to my time tick system and pretty
09:50 - much on every second I'm going to try to
09:52 - get these
09:54 - things
09:57 - learning your turn-based strategy course
09:59 - 58 done oh it's awesome learn about
10:01 - something ah nice
10:03 - when should I use Singletons there are
10:05 - some rules internet opinions vary uh
10:07 - yeah it depends on for me as a general
10:09 - rule basically if there is something of
10:11 - which there's only one thing then by all
10:13 - means go ahead and make it a sentence so
10:15 - over here on this project I've got tons
10:16 - of Singletons like for example over here
10:18 - the tutorial manager this one handles
10:20 - the tutorial there's only one tutorial
10:21 - manager so it makes perfect sense for
10:23 - this one to be a Singleton then on the
10:25 - other hand for dinkies I've got tons of
10:27 - dinkies so it makes no sense for the
10:29 - dinky itself to be a Singleton uh on the
10:31 - player kind of the same thing so there
10:34 - are multiple players but at the same
10:35 - time there's only one local player so I
10:37 - do have a Singleton reference for the
10:39 - local instance so yeah pretty much for
10:41 - anything that you have just a single one
10:43 - of by all means go ahead and make it a
10:45 - Singleton as long as there's only one
10:47 - exists then that's a perfect thing I
10:49 - know there are lots of people who really
10:51 - hate the Singleton pattern never
10:52 - actually want to use it but for me I
10:54 - find to be super useful if there's
10:56 - anything where just exists just one
10:58 - thing then yep it should definitely be a
11:01 - single thing okay so let me try to think
11:03 - a little about this so basically the
11:05 - first thing is I want to do actually for
11:06 - dinky Mount I can go to dinky because
11:08 - I'm pretty sure yeah I already got a get
11:10 - ink amount
11:11 - so I can just do debug.hog on dinky
11:14 - amount
11:16 - and put in the dinky amount
11:19 - then I guess debug.log in order to test
11:23 - for the house bumpy rocket and for the
11:26 - rocket
11:27 - let's think how am I going to do I think
11:29 - the best thing is kind of how I was
11:31 - handling the uh my save system which I
11:34 - pretty much just did a query a physics
11:37 - query to find all the objects in the
11:39 - world
11:40 - pretty sure that's what I did right
11:43 - um
11:44 - yep that's pretty much it so just doing
11:46 - a basic physics querying so over here
11:48 - don't let me try to do pretty much these
11:51 - same things so
11:53 - uh all right so I'm going to go to the
11:55 - entire world size and so on
11:58 - unlike total Liberation more than 10
12:00 - yards well I mean the good news is that
12:02 - game is not canceled that one is just
12:04 - post one for next year so yeah
12:06 - definitely stay tuned for next year are
12:08 - you using tune [ __ ] in this project yep
12:10 - I'm using what is called the Quigley
12:13 - asset so if I can just go into the asset
12:16 - store
12:19 - it's a really nice one
12:22 - I've mentioned it a bunch of times there
12:25 - it has been part of a bunch of bundles
12:27 - so yeah this is the one that I'm using
12:29 - it's a really nice Shader with tons and
12:30 - tons of options so over here in the game
12:33 - yeah actually I haven't actually played
12:35 - the game hey super Chad Tracy hunt hey
12:37 - thanks so much thanks for being here I'm
12:39 - glad you liked the videos thank you so
12:40 - much
12:42 - the first Super Chat oh that's cool
12:44 - thanks for using your first super
12:46 - channel on me all right thank you so
12:47 - much uh
12:50 - uh okay what was I saying all right the
12:53 - uh the assets
12:55 - yeah I'm basically using equivalently
12:57 - okay let me pick a bigger one with a
12:59 - bunch more things so my big save with a
13:02 - nice big machine so yeah pretty much I'm
13:04 - using the equivalent Shader to make all
13:06 - of these assets and look quite a bit
13:07 - more cartoony because these are actually
13:09 - the uh sci-fi worlds pack
13:12 - ah crap yes the Sci-Fi worlds
13:17 - yeah basically this is the pack that I'm
13:19 - using for most of these assets so see
13:21 - that little round thing that is pretty
13:23 - much over here the HQ and you can see
13:25 - how it looks quite different because
13:26 - it's using quite a different uh shaders
13:29 - so if you want to make your assets look
13:30 - quite a bit different I would definitely
13:32 - recommend
13:33 - using an interesting Shader if you apply
13:35 - an interesting shade and everything kind
13:37 - of looks like it fits so it looks pretty
13:39 - good so so yeah and basically the way
13:41 - that I was saying uh yeah I'm using the
13:43 - equivalently Shader asset and I'm using
13:45 - just modifying the color of the outline
13:47 - in order to select Which object is
13:49 - actually selected and that has been
13:51 - quite useful pretty much just go
13:53 - into the materials so I've got a ton of
13:57 - materials using all kinds of things for
13:58 - example over here for the food material
14:00 - so I've got the food texture map and
14:02 - over here I've got a black outline and
14:03 - then I swap out for one that has the
14:05 - white outline and that's pretty much how
14:07 - I'm handling the visuals for the object
14:08 - solution so pretty basic and it works
14:11 - pretty well I think it changes the
14:13 - outline which I think makes everything
14:14 - look quite nice it's super easy to see
14:16 - what object is selected so everything
14:18 - looks pretty good okay
14:22 - all right
14:25 - okay let me just continue with the goals
14:27 - here so for the although actually for
14:30 - the rocket
14:32 - I was thinking about doing this but yeah
14:34 - once again a while ago we were talking
14:36 - about
14:37 - Singletons and for example the rocket is
14:39 - only ever going to have a single rocket
14:41 - so I can actually make this a Singleton
14:44 - so an instance with a get a private set
14:48 - and then down here on the awake
14:51 - all right boy the way just instance
14:53 - equals this
14:55 - since the rocket is only going to have
14:56 - this one so for the gold manager for
14:59 - this one to test if it has a rocket just
15:00 - debug the hog
15:02 - has rocket
15:04 - and I can just go into the rocket base
15:08 - and the instance if it is not known then
15:10 - I do have rocket if not then
15:12 - I don't have a rocket okay so that's the
15:14 - other goal
15:15 - and then fully automate The Colony so no
15:18 - dinky's working and for that I actually
15:20 - also have a dinky get the dinking list
15:23 - so this one returns only so dinky for
15:26 - the banking list
15:27 - so I can get that one and do a four inch
15:31 - uh Dinky Dinky in the dinky list
15:34 - I can cycle through all of those and
15:37 - thank you dot do I have an is item is I
15:40 - don't think we have okay great all right
15:42 - so I already have this function so that
15:43 - actually simplifies things quite a bit
15:45 - so if one of them is not idle
15:48 - so uh hint uh dinky is working
15:53 - then dinky's working plus was if it is
15:57 - not I don't then think he's working so
15:59 - debug.log for
16:01 - for the dinkies working
16:04 - and just put the link is working okay so
16:06 - that's the other gun
16:09 - and for the other one so if only
16:11 - automate The Colony so none of them can
16:12 - be working then keep the colony safe
16:14 - okay this is the one that is going to be
16:16 - a bit tricky
16:18 - your PC configuration uh
16:21 - I have no idea I've got a a 380 and a uh
16:27 - CPU is a 5950x I think it's like three
16:31 - years old but it's still pretty good
16:35 - to use blender in your 3D software I've
16:38 - used it a little bit I've tried learning
16:40 - blender actually made a video because I
16:43 - I followed the course and I did manage
16:44 - to learn quite a bit so if you want to
16:46 - see what I managed to build in about 10
16:48 - hours and this was a fun video you can
16:51 - actually learn quite a bit even if
16:53 - you're I mean I'm definitely not a
16:54 - blender Pro but I did manage to build
16:57 - some pretty nice things over here
16:59 - let me just go ah crap I can see uh
17:04 - yeah the final the final thing actually
17:06 - looks pretty good I made all these
17:07 - models after following a course for
17:09 - about 10 hours I think something like
17:11 - that so yeah
17:13 - yeah if you're interested in 3D modeling
17:15 - definitely I would recommend you give it
17:17 - a shot because it's not as difficult as
17:19 - it seems pretty much
17:21 - uh right uh okay so
17:24 - oh crap this is messing up my save
17:26 - that's okay keep the it's gonna be there
17:29 - uh okay so I'm gonna have to figure out
17:31 - how do I keep the colony safe and then
17:33 - launch into space okay but for these
17:36 - ones
17:37 - I think the logic for these goals
17:39 - should be working so let me just quickly
17:42 - test it out all right you know asset
17:45 - Forge by Kenny I've never I'm familiar
17:48 - with Kenny's assets but I've never used
17:50 - acid Forge that's his like 3D modeling
17:52 - program something like that which does
17:55 - does seem quite interesting from what I
17:57 - see of his uh gifs posted on Twitter it
18:00 - does seem quite interesting so yeah I've
18:02 - never used it myself but yeah if you
18:03 - want to make some simple things then
18:06 - that can be quite useful okay where's my
18:08 - console
18:09 - uh okay so apparently two dinkies are
18:12 - working is that correct okay this one is
18:14 - working so I put this one on idle uh any
18:17 - more dinkies that are working and
18:20 - there's one over here picking up objects
18:22 - no not this one
18:24 - nope not this one which one that one
18:27 - why is this one picking up objects
18:30 - okay I don't know but set it on I don't
18:32 - okay so I think he's working zero and
18:35 - true
18:36 - for the rocket really do I have a rocket
18:39 - here
18:41 - uh I don't think I want a rocket in this
18:44 - map
18:45 - did I
18:48 - okay that's a bit strange because I
18:50 - don't think I've done the rocket
18:53 - all right
18:56 - did I build the rocket anywhere no
19:01 - or did I put it
19:03 - yeah different from no
19:06 - okay
19:19 - are you planning to add features to the
19:20 - character on like a face or hat or
19:22 - something uh yep the asset pack that I
19:24 - chose for the characters has a a ton of
19:27 - customization options so yep I will
19:29 - definitely be adding those in the future
19:30 - right now the only thing that I have is
19:32 - just just changing the colors but yep in
19:35 - the final version it will indeed have
19:36 - tons of things that you can use to
19:39 - customize a character to make them look
19:40 - quite a bit interesting
19:41 - okay so seriously I
19:45 - alright so now I'm a bit confused did I
19:49 - add it to the wrong thing
19:51 - uh nope I added it over here the rocket
19:54 - base
19:55 - this is some
19:57 - okay I'm not sure
20:00 - why this one is doing
20:02 - this because this one should be known
20:05 - right yeah
20:08 - has Rockets let me just print out this
20:12 - then that
20:22 - how to make my name like yours with the
20:24 - black background the outline these are
20:25 - the members so yeah Timber Jones here is
20:27 - a member of the channel so thank you so
20:29 - much yeah uh
20:32 - uh okay
20:34 - tutorials on planning out code for game
20:39 - uh I'm almost finished with your build
20:41 - defender course and there is so many
20:43 - scripts that link together I wonder how
20:44 - do you plan for that uh as with so many
20:47 - things the answer usually comes down to
20:48 - experience so that's one answer but the
20:52 - other answer is it really depends on a
20:53 - person by person based like some people
20:55 - like to make all kinds of diagrams and
20:57 - really uh really draw a bunch of
20:59 - pictures that say this system connects
21:01 - to this one this one and so on some
21:03 - people like to do that for me I don't
21:04 - really do that all that much I just do
21:06 - it a tiny bit and for the most part yeah
21:09 - I already have enough experience that I
21:11 - know when I think about some kind of
21:13 - system that I want to build I already
21:15 - know how it's going to connect what kind
21:17 - of other systems do I need to interact
21:18 - with those systems something like that
21:23 - okay so that's even more strange did I
21:26 - change something okay so this is one of
21:29 - those things that quite confused me
21:31 - because a while ago it was saying true
21:33 - that I perhaps not save it
21:35 - don't you need to reset the Singleton
21:37 - between the games nope because the
21:39 - Singleton just gets destroyed so as soon
21:41 - as I change scenes the objects that I'm
21:43 - over here because for The Singletons I'm
21:45 - not using these uh static classes these
21:47 - are for example over here they go
21:48 - manager this is an actual regular amount
21:50 - of behavior which is attached to a
21:52 - regular game object on the scene so as
21:54 - soon as I change scene that game object
21:56 - is going to be destroyed so the instance
21:58 - gets cleaned up automatically so nope
22:00 - you don't need to do that the only place
22:02 - where I do need to reset is my yeah I've
22:05 - got a reset static data mono Behavior
22:08 - just a nice class that exists on the
22:10 - main menu to restart to reset a bunch of
22:12 - things and I'm pretty much just using it
22:14 - for example over here I've got a static
22:16 - list so this is not going to be cleared
22:18 - up automatically so for this one I do
22:20 - need to manually clear it up and the
22:22 - most important thing is for all the
22:23 - events so I've got a bunch of static
22:25 - events like for this one when any carry
22:27 - vehicle opens UI or when any gets
22:29 - destroyed static events they don't get
22:31 - destroyed automatically so for this yep
22:33 - I do need to reset them manually but for
22:36 - just Singleton static instances for
22:38 - those you don't really need to worry too
22:41 - much
22:42 - how many games have you made I think
22:44 - it's eight yeah I think this is going to
22:46 - be my ninth game so
22:48 - yeah it has already been quite a lot
22:51 - although that is in the context of uh
22:55 - 2012 so yeah about 10 years 9 games so
22:59 - yeah roughly something like that okay so
23:01 - I'm a bit confused as to why this was
23:04 - I have no idea did I forget to save a
23:06 - while ago I don't know
23:09 - but
23:11 - was because I didn't have the
23:12 - parentheses that it was doing something
23:14 - strange with the
23:16 - okay I'm not entirely sure but anyway so
23:18 - now the logic is working that one does
23:20 - say false because the rocket does not
23:22 - exist because of course does not exist
23:24 - let me just actually try to make a
23:26 - rocket do I have to actually
23:31 - yeah this is the one thing that I really
23:32 - need to change and let me use my debug
23:34 - menu just to automatically complete uh
23:37 - the research
23:39 - so let me do okay take out the that bot
23:42 - just finish the research for the rocket
23:44 - and actually I'm going to need to
23:46 - spawn the rocket button might as well
23:48 - see a
23:49 - the rocket is actually not this one the
23:51 - optimization is in here because it's
23:53 - looking smooth actually no actually
23:54 - right now everything is pretty much
23:57 - uh well I wouldn't say unoptimize I mean
23:59 - I didn't try to make sure that the code
24:01 - was decent but no I did not think uh too
24:05 - much about optimization
24:07 - I haven't done that so yeah but it is
24:10 - working quite decently
24:12 - if I'm working the
24:14 - analysis profiler
24:18 - and uh
24:19 - okay so let's see a random frame
24:22 - so what is it doing
24:25 - okay so a bunch of thing on the render
24:26 - pipeline
24:28 - and a bunch of squirts here I do got a
24:30 - quite a bit of garbage okay look at that
24:32 - the chase mine yeah no it's not the
24:35 - overall apps here but something on the
24:37 - chase mine is taking a bunch of garbage
24:40 - what is it yeah because basically for uh
24:43 - for actually doing optimization I
24:45 - haven't worried too much about it as
24:47 - long as it's playable right now I very
24:49 - much uh
24:52 - won't the game be free you know the
24:53 - final game is going to be a regular paid
24:55 - game but the demo is free so if you want
24:57 - go ahead go on to steam right now and
24:59 - play the free demo
25:01 - foreign
25:03 - so this one is actually generating
25:05 - garbage why is that well first of all if
25:08 - I were to optimize this the first thing
25:10 - I would do would be not to look for a
25:12 - Target on every single update I'm pretty
25:14 - sure I did do uh like for example on the
25:17 - uh gather resources
25:20 - on the dinky behavior for dinkies
25:22 - Gathering resources yep for here over
25:25 - here I use a basic timer just make sure
25:27 - that it doesn't test on every single
25:29 - thing so I'm just doing it overlaps here
25:31 - but only doing it every x amount of time
25:33 - so that is if I were to optimize over
25:35 - here Chase mine that's what I would do
25:36 - instead of looking for Target on every
25:38 - single update I would make it all look
25:40 - at most five times per second that is
25:42 - more than enough
25:43 - so
25:45 - yeah because over here he's constantly
25:46 - doing that the array yeah this one is
25:49 - it's probably over here that it's
25:51 - generating all that garbage so I got a
25:52 - whole bunch of Chase mines so all those
25:55 - are generating the garbage because
25:56 - they're all constantly grabbing a
25:58 - collateral array on every single update
26:00 - so yep I will definitely uh play around
26:02 - this try to fix things but yeah for a
26:05 - for a regular hey your answer hey how's
26:08 - it going uh yeah so for a demo I'm
26:11 - mostly focused on actually implementing
26:13 - things
26:14 - and not oh and Jason Wyman as well hey
26:17 - Jason how's it going nice uh right okay
26:21 - let me just
26:22 - kill the the zombies just make sure that
26:26 - they don't actually wipe out my entire
26:28 - base because I don't have to get a
26:30 - different saving that would be tricky
26:32 - uh all right
26:34 - okay what was I doing uh I need to spawn
26:38 - what do I need to spawn uh all right
26:41 - that's the other thing that I need to
26:42 - work on afterwards right let me just go
26:45 - into the HQ and I wanted to spawn the
26:49 - rocket
26:50 - okay so I guess now I might as well
26:53 - yeah try to get all of these
26:58 - fun watching all the code oh it's
27:00 - awesome are you working on the RPG hey
27:02 - best of luck with that I hope it's going
27:04 - well nice
27:05 - where they use a tick system uh I've got
27:08 - a Time Tech system it's just a super
27:10 - helpful basic class that just triggers
27:14 - the take on every 0.2 seconds so just
27:16 - five times so any logic that I have that
27:19 - I want to do instead of being on every
27:21 - update instead of having to do instead
27:23 - of having to manually handle a timer I
27:25 - can just listen to one of these events
27:26 - and do something on this on tick for
27:29 - example what am I doing like for example
27:31 - over here on the tutorial manager in
27:33 - order to complete this tutorial I'm
27:35 - going for Gather Five Stone instead of
27:37 - checking on every single update to check
27:38 - if that crate container has five Zone
27:41 - instead of that it's really just
27:43 - listening to that only on the time Tech
27:45 - system so on the time tick so pretty
27:47 - much just five times per second instead
27:49 - of doing it on every update it doesn't
27:51 - overlap sphere to find that one and so
27:53 - on so yeah the time take system is super
27:55 - useful in terms of performance and
27:57 - really just not wasting things and
27:58 - actually that is something that I that
28:01 - script the time take system that is
28:02 - actually something
28:04 - that I did
28:06 - in a video a very long time ago so here
28:09 - it is authentic system I made two videos
28:10 - on it this was in 2018 and before that
28:14 - on many of my Steam games I also use
28:16 - this so
28:18 - yeah that's the one great example about
28:21 - writing some good code you can then
28:23 - reuse it on tons of things
28:26 - or intensive things many years in the
28:28 - future so that is super useful all right
28:35 - uh okay so let me just get back to work
28:38 - on Little Bits all right
28:42 - uh okay what was I doing okay let me
28:45 - just try to make a thing so let's see
28:48 - what do I need to get I'm going to need
28:51 - some tier two some microchips some
28:53 - greenium I think I've got some regular
28:55 - greenium okay so I can use
28:57 - this one right here let me just place
29:00 - okay I've got way too many mod way too
29:03 - many objects on this testing scene that
29:05 - actually makes things quite a bit tricky
29:07 - so let me just
29:08 - place a bunch more of these because yeah
29:11 - this definitely yeah that is one thing
29:12 - that I do need to improve for the final
29:14 - game is come up with some things to like
29:17 - encourage the player to spread out the
29:19 - bass a bit more because over here this
29:21 - is way too busy there are way too many
29:22 - things
29:23 - oh look at that did I just encounter a
29:25 - bug Maybe
29:27 - huh was it because the saves
29:30 - okay so I'll have to figure that out
29:33 - what happened to the
29:35 - okay that's interesting so because I had
29:37 - one of these Bots was over here
29:39 - interacting and feeding things into
29:41 - storage
29:42 - but apparently the bot got tired and
29:44 - decided that it didn't want to do so I'm
29:46 - not sure
29:51 - oh because it's
29:54 - all right anyways I'm not sure what
29:57 - happened here maybe an issue of the save
29:58 - so I'll have to look into that okay so
30:00 - again I get distracted way too much so I
30:02 - need to get some tier two ingots some
30:04 - microchips some purple let me use my
30:06 - debug menu to spawn some
30:09 - some purple crystals some tier 2 ingots
30:13 - let me just Place those so not you you
30:16 - place it in there some tier two and just
30:19 - need what else uh greenium purple just
30:22 - the microchips so let me grab some
30:25 - microchips
30:27 - how can I use the line renderer in a
30:28 - network variable
30:31 - uh the answer is you don't use well
30:35 - could you use the Line Runner no I don't
30:37 - think so uh yeah basically the answer is
30:39 - the online render is really just a list
30:41 - of vector threes
30:42 - so you would simply synchronize a
30:45 - networking list of vector 3. so you can
30:48 - just do the same amount of behavior so
30:50 - this is not the one this one is also not
30:52 - abundant Behavior okay so I need one
30:53 - yeah so you can make a private network
30:56 - list of vector three
30:59 - so you can do that for the what you call
31:01 - line renderer Point list
31:04 - so you can pretty much just see this
31:05 - just synchronize that list and then on
31:07 - the online renderer you can actually set
31:09 - those I think I use that then I use that
31:12 - on the
31:13 - uh it was a recent video
31:15 - what oh right the track your path over
31:18 - here I'm pretty sure that I use the
31:20 - online renderer for the
31:22 - for calculating the thing for the pad
31:25 - position list
31:26 - then web online rendering
31:28 - yes I'm pretty sure the online render
31:30 - does work with alist yep there you go
31:32 - you set the position count then you call
31:34 - set positions and so on so basically you
31:35 - would synchronize a list of vector
31:37 - threes and then just call and set
31:39 - positions and you would do it just like
31:41 - that so remember you don't have to
31:42 - synchronize the entire component you can
31:44 - just break down the component into into
31:47 - the components that make up that
31:48 - component and just synchronize that data
31:50 - instead of the components itself so yep
31:52 - that's what I would do yeah
31:55 - so let's say it's really cluttered yeah
31:58 - yeah the computer doesn't even throw
31:59 - yeah that's uh it definitely still needs
32:02 - optimization work but yeah honestly I'm
32:04 - surprised that right now without having
32:06 - to focus too much on optimization
32:08 - everything is looking pretty good so
32:10 - yeah I'm pretty
32:11 - pretty impressed pretty pleased with the
32:13 - current performance of the demo so
32:15 - that's nice
32:17 - all right
32:19 - how many dollars will the game cost I
32:21 - don't know maybe five maybe ten maybe 12
32:25 - I don't know that is something that I
32:27 - still haven't figured out exactly what
32:29 - it's going to be uh okay so the last
32:32 - thing that I needed was just see
32:33 - microchip so let me just get those
32:35 - uh get those where's the microchips oh
32:39 - Electronics that's it uh where did it
32:42 - spawn there it is
32:43 - it's right here places in there so let
32:45 - me just link those so I'll link that one
32:47 - link that one
32:49 - put that one and that one
32:52 - and craft and there you go it does work
32:54 - is this your biggest game yet uh no no
32:57 - actually I just I just did a a short a
33:01 - while ago so I don't know how many of
33:03 - you watch shorts but actually just did a
33:05 - pretty fun chart which was on the
33:08 - on how many lines of code I wrote in two
33:11 - weeks which was the two weeks leading up
33:13 - to this and the answer was about sixteen
33:15 - thousand which is quite a lot in two
33:18 - weeks that's about a thousand lines of
33:19 - code per day so that's a ton of work a
33:21 - ton of stuff but yeah definitely not my
33:24 - I'm pretty sure that uh Battleground
33:25 - Tycoon my previous game was like
33:29 - I don't know I'm pretty sure it was over
33:31 - a hundred thousand so yeah that one I
33:33 - would say is still quite a bit more more
33:36 - complex so
33:38 - yeah but this one is still only them
33:39 - yeah it's over nine thousand definitely
33:41 - it's uh
33:43 - yeah so but this is just them so who
33:46 - knows by the time the the game is
33:48 - complete Maybe by then this will indeed
33:51 - be my most complex am yet I'm not sure
33:53 - we'll see
33:59 - in Sim sets are correct it says you have
34:01 - 165 followers that means 151600 wishlist
34:05 - uh nope the wish lists are a bit better
34:08 - than that they are currently on 2300 I
34:10 - think or 2400 something like that one of
34:13 - those two so
34:14 - yeah it is going pretty decently I mean
34:17 - my goal is to uh
34:20 - get up to about
34:22 - [Music]
34:22 - um
34:24 - at least five thousand by the release
34:26 - date and release date is in about two
34:30 - months maybe so yeah the goal was to be
34:32 - able to get up to five thousand all the
34:34 - time which hopefully should be doable so
34:37 - let's see so far development is going
34:39 - good wish lists are going pretty decent
34:40 - so yep definitely keeping up all right
34:49 - all right
34:50 - which one the rocket cost
34:54 - uh actually cause is something that I
34:57 - still don't know read my comment what
34:58 - comment sorry I'm trying to keep up but
35:02 - yeah I don't see any comment from you
35:06 - make an open world Street Racing hack
35:08 - and slash first person third person with
35:10 - what
35:12 - okay I mean if you're a beginner and
35:15 - you're asking that question I would say
35:17 - definitely limit your scope
35:19 - open world Street Racing hack and slash
35:22 - first second third person ball time I
35:24 - mean technically that is possible
35:26 - uh but yeah as a solo Dev especially if
35:29 - you're not very experienced I would
35:30 - definitely encourage you to limit your
35:33 - your ideas to something a bit more
35:35 - manageable uh okay
35:38 - uh I'm quite a bit distracted I have to
35:41 - say but all right
35:42 - uh okay so that one
35:45 - so I was doing all that just to be able
35:47 - to see if the logic for beyond the
35:48 - rocket it is true and it is indeed
35:50 - working okay someone has X number of
35:52 - things
35:54 - I think how much will the game cost uh
35:56 - like I said so I'm not sure
35:58 - perhaps five dollars perhaps 10 I'm not
36:02 - sure can you show the save system yep
36:04 - the save system is actually super simple
36:06 - I mean it's very verbose because right
36:09 - now I'm I'm storing a ton of stuff
36:11 - but yeah pretty much all this is just
36:14 - copy paste for different types of things
36:15 - so it's really just I got a save object
36:18 - or a list of save objects and then I
36:21 - just initialize those lists and I just
36:23 - do a basic physics overlaps here on the
36:26 - entire world just an easy way to cycle
36:27 - through every single object in the world
36:29 - then I try to get the component of a
36:31 - bunch of things I go into that object
36:33 - and I get a save object out of it so for
36:36 - example over here the carry object these
36:38 - are the vehicles that move back and
36:40 - forth over here this one has a save
36:42 - object so this one just saves uh if this
36:44 - one is carrying anything and it saves
36:46 - the position so pretty much very simple
36:49 - and basically just creates a save object
36:51 - which in turn is converting to Json and
36:53 - then for unloading the spawn back
36:54 - together that once again gets the same
36:57 - save object then just instantiates the
36:59 - object and so on so the save system is
37:02 - actually something that I covered quite
37:04 - a long time ago and it's still exactly
37:06 - the same thing that I use nowadays
37:09 - so saving and loading to a file using
37:12 - Json so this video from 2018 this is
37:14 - still exactly how I do things nowadays
37:16 - so pretty much just create a safe object
37:19 - of something like for example here the
37:21 - dinky the dinky has a save object it's
37:23 - going to store the position the hunger
37:25 - Mount whatever dinky behavior is
37:27 - currently active as well as which house
37:29 - spawned on this linking and pretty much
37:31 - just converts that into a save object
37:33 - which in turn the save system takes all
37:36 - of that converts all of that into Json
37:38 - then saves that into a path so let's
37:40 - open just for fun let's look at a
37:43 - a save object so let me go it's on the
37:46 - other side
37:48 - these saves let me see a big one
37:50 - all right so there you go this is the
37:52 - save object which as you can see it's
37:54 - also not optimized so it's storing a ton
37:56 - of wasteful data but still this is only
37:58 - 36 kilobytes so this is all pretty basic
38:02 - uh yeah this is the save object this is
38:05 - what saves on that so everything that
38:07 - you saw on that game over there it's all
38:09 - in here did you Cipher it nope this is a
38:12 - single player game or a Co-op
38:14 - multiplayer game so yeah I don't I don't
38:16 - really care if you go up here and you
38:17 - cheat like for example here is the
38:19 - hunger Mount so some random dinky has
38:21 - 134 hunger I don't really care if you
38:24 - come up here and you say 999 so that it
38:26 - never gets hungry if that's what you
38:28 - want to do by all means go ahead so yeah
38:31 - everything is stored here everything in
38:33 - nice plain text doesn't really matter so
38:36 - yep the safe system is pretty basic so
38:38 - if you want to see definitely go watch
38:40 - that video it's from 2018 but everything
38:42 - everything that I do nowadays don't
38:44 - pretty much exactly the same
38:47 - uh all right so basically what I was
38:49 - doing is I was just figuring out on the
38:51 - goal manager and once again Tracy on
38:53 - thanks so much for the Super Chat thank
38:55 - you uh Sunday gold managers over here so
38:58 - I'm tracking the thing came out I'm
39:00 - tracking the rocket amount uh I'm
39:02 - tracking how many denkis are working
39:05 - so what else do I need I need to keep
39:07 - the colony safe so
39:09 - yeah that is the one that is going to be
39:12 - quite tricky
39:14 - because I gotta figure out how do I
39:16 - Define uh
39:19 - uh was a zombie spawner what did I call
39:21 - it the zombie spawner
39:23 - uh
39:26 - uh I guess I could have like a
39:32 - like a private float last time attack
39:40 - I could have something like this
39:44 - and then up here on this one I could do
39:46 - a set last time attack and then I could
39:50 - do last time attack equals time dot time
39:54 - all right so then I could go on to the
39:56 - zombie and when the zombie attacks
39:58 - something
39:59 - so moving to attack dinky and whenever
40:02 - the U attack a dinky
40:05 - go into Terry dinky and the deal damage
40:07 - so up here I could go into zombie
40:09 - spawner did I Make an instance I did so
40:11 - let's call the uh set last time attack
40:15 - so with that that would
40:18 - okay so yeah I do think like this it
40:21 - would work so that defines the last time
40:23 - attack
40:26 - all right then a public float get time
40:30 - since last attack
40:34 - oh great make a course yeah I've got
40:35 - plenty of courses and I'd love to make
40:38 - another one but I'd love to make another
40:40 - one at the same time I'd love to work on
40:42 - this game so there are so many things
40:44 - that I'd love to do if only I could find
40:46 - the time
40:48 - so yeah
40:49 - okay get the time because time dot time
40:52 - oh this is the beginning of this Frame
40:53 - so this is not what I want uh it's the
40:55 - real time since startup yeah that's what
40:58 - I want uh all right so I get the time
41:01 - since last attack and this I think is
41:03 - going to be in seconds
41:05 - so let me go into the goal manager
41:09 - and let's go into the zombie spawner
41:11 - instance get time since last attack load
41:15 - for the time since last attack
41:18 - and I get that one just see we debug
41:20 - don't log on the time okay all the time
41:23 - since the last attack
41:26 - just get this one
41:29 - okay
41:33 - won't that continue even when paused
41:35 - actually that's a good question
41:38 - because I don't know if time Dot
41:42 - that's actually a very good question
41:44 - because I don't know if this one stops
41:47 - on
41:50 - because I thought there were two of them
41:52 - yeah I thought one was
41:54 - on Dante time and one was not
42:00 - okay so let's figure that out that is
42:02 - actually super simple to figure out so
42:03 - let me just go yeah just over here and
42:06 - let's go on to the time tag so just do a
42:08 - debug the hug on the time real time some
42:10 - syrup and let's see if that one where's
42:13 - my thing real time will continue time
42:16 - will pause
42:18 - yeah but the time was
42:22 - so what kind of times you have
42:25 - real time since syrup
42:28 - yeah but the time
42:31 - oh the time at the beginning of this
42:32 - Frame okay yeah
42:35 - oh it was the unscale time okay that's
42:37 - what I was thinking okay so that's what
42:38 - I was thinking
42:40 - so yeah I do think real time might stop
42:42 - so I do think it should probably be uh
42:45 - okay so over here it's actually not
42:47 - spawning so let me just continue
42:50 - uh let's see that one okay 32 33 34 and
42:53 - I pause
42:55 - right it's not but now if I unpause that
42:57 - code is going to run yeah 38 okay so
42:59 - that one does not get impacted so I
43:02 - cannot use that one but yeah so I think
43:04 - I was I was correct in the beginning so
43:06 - it is time.time
43:08 - so without it should actually say
43:11 - now that one should stop since
43:14 - apparently it's the unscaled time that's
43:16 - the one that I was confusing when
43:18 - all right
43:24 - uh
43:26 - so let's go there continue
43:30 - and let's see okay three seconds four
43:33 - seconds
43:35 - oh actually yeah that is something that
43:37 - I yeah I definitely need to update that
43:39 - on start otherwise it's going to be
43:41 - messed up again anyway okay so pause on
43:43 - 14 wait a few seconds wait a few seconds
43:45 - unpause and now it's in size 15. okay
43:48 - awesome cool all right so that works
43:51 - test message yeah test successful all
43:55 - right okay so that work
43:57 - love your videos Ah that's awesome I'm
43:59 - glad you're watching them why don't you
44:01 - don't like them
44:04 - hey there hey Paul how's it going uh all
44:07 - right so basically I just need to
44:09 - set oh right yeah I was thinking about
44:12 - setting this on the beginning
44:15 - but
44:17 - no I also gotta I also gotta save this
44:20 - hmm
44:24 - all right so I was thinking I mean I can
44:27 - probably put it over here
44:28 - on the awake just to fix things a little
44:31 - bit but
44:34 - right yeah anyway so I do think this
44:37 - does work so okay let me just uh
44:41 - see if the time since the last attack if
44:43 - that one is working which should be
44:45 - working so let's ignore the time.time
44:47 - over there
44:49 - because sometimes I say but the
44:50 - character didn't update uh that part has
44:54 - a manual thing so let me just
44:58 - let me just manually try to see if
45:01 - there's any new characters
45:10 - uh
45:12 - okay right let me try to see that one
45:16 - if there's any characters that one takes
45:18 - a little bit
45:19 - um
45:21 - right all of those are validated there's
45:23 - another one let me validate it
45:27 - anymore
45:31 - uh right there was one that was
45:34 - validated but
45:36 - who was
45:38 - saying that oh boy I've got way too many
45:41 - way too many tabs artem
45:45 - uh
45:48 - uh right uh I do see yours and yours is
45:50 - validated but you need to go into the
45:52 - user account page and you need to link
45:55 - your YouTube account otherwise the
45:57 - overlay over here doesn't know uh which
46:01 - account
46:02 - belongs to you so basically you need to
46:04 - go onto your user page on the website
46:06 - and you need to click over here in order
46:08 - to link your YouTube account then the uh
46:11 - overlay over here won't be able to know
46:13 - which character blocks you and then it
46:14 - will apply the custom thing so yeah just
46:17 - go ahead and do that and it should work
46:20 - game looks amazing oh it's awesome thank
46:22 - you I hope you like it yeah so far
46:25 - things have been quite interesting all
46:26 - right okay so let me see the time since
46:29 - last attack so let me go into single
46:30 - player and uh yeah continue
46:34 - and all right so let's see so that one
46:37 - is going to start from zero okay I'm
46:38 - going to need to save that sure but yeah
46:41 - all right so time since last attack let
46:44 - me spawn a zombie just to see if this is
46:47 - going to work
46:48 - actually I'm probably going to need to
46:50 - spawn multiple zombie or let me just
46:52 - just throw one dinky directly onto the
46:55 - zombie that's a bit
46:56 - sadistic I don't know sorry but yeah
46:59 - just for testing you're gonna be
47:01 - sacrificed okay I'm sorry but yep it did
47:05 - work so it was over there on 26 and as
47:07 - soon as he had he reset the timer
47:10 - okay so that's good so that's basically
47:12 - how I'm going to keep the colony safe so
47:14 - if it goes for I don't know maybe three
47:16 - minutes
47:17 - seven videos for three minutes without a
47:20 - single attack then continues uh
47:23 - then considers that the colony is indeed
47:25 - safe all right
47:27 - okay so with that honestly the guns are
47:29 - pretty much on working I think so let me
47:32 - just make a vision for that so let's see
47:35 - if it works
47:36 - okay so let's make a nice gold visual
47:39 - I'm just going to 2D mode
47:42 - 350 RTX isn't good for Unity uh as
47:45 - always when it comes to Hardware the
47:47 - answer is depends on what kinds of games
47:49 - you want to make if you want to make
47:51 - simple games then pretty much anything
47:52 - is going to work
47:54 - so yeah 30 50 if you're trying to make a
47:57 - giant open world game with super high
47:59 - quality textures then maybe it won't be
48:01 - enough but if you're making a regular
48:04 - game then it probably won't be enough
48:06 - uh for the goals UI why did I
48:11 - is this inside something it isn't inside
48:14 - anything right
48:15 - nope okay so I'm not sure just put them
48:19 - like oh crap uh
48:23 - okay so for all these let me just
48:26 - put them all just like that because I
48:28 - don't want you to scale
48:30 - and let me scale down that goes
48:33 - kind of for okay exactly that's what I
48:35 - want and let me also add my super useful
48:37 - component to reset the position on the
48:40 - UI so this is why I have all my UI
48:43 - Windows all spread over the place
48:45 - visually I can position them and this
48:47 - way I can easily move around and
48:48 - interact with any of these windows and
48:51 - all of them have this component which
48:52 - pretty much just goes and resets the
48:54 - anchor position and the size Delta so
48:56 - pretty much it sets all of these values
48:58 - on zero so as soon as the game starts
49:00 - all of them going to the canvas so just
49:02 - super useful for actually developing the
49:04 - game so I can move things to the side
49:05 - and I can easily play with them alright
49:07 - so on this one
49:10 - on the gonzi Y uh it's going to be a bit
49:13 - tricky how am I going to
49:15 - how am I going to fit such information
49:18 - over here that's the part that's going
49:19 - to be
49:20 - quite tricky uh
49:28 - trying to think uh do I do a text based
49:35 - okay yeah I think the easiest way is
49:37 - we're only just
49:39 - do it text based and then maybe I'll
49:41 - swap for something a bit more visually
49:43 - interesting
49:45 - so for now okay
49:48 - so for now let me just make the basic
49:50 - for the goals UI something like that
49:52 - always a pain when you have one on top
49:54 - the other yep it is and it's because
49:56 - that pain that annoyance that annoyed me
49:58 - for so long that I finally decided okay
50:00 - I need something something better and
50:03 - that's how I come up with this method of
50:05 - move them to the side and during run
50:07 - time put them back where they should so
50:09 - yeah uh all right so over here I'm going
50:12 - to crack my my to-doneless over there uh
50:17 - so I'm going to need a serialized film
50:19 - for a private text mesh Pro ugly for the
50:24 - text mesh just something like that
50:26 - uh all right so I'm going to
50:29 - pretty much just right so it's this one
50:31 - right so this one is the
50:33 - the uh title text
50:36 - this one goes text this one just text
50:40 - yet that doesn't matter all right so
50:42 - let's put the goals text did I not
50:51 - how to resize direct transform by
50:53 - dragging the button
50:57 - by dragging the button what button
51:03 - you mean click and drag
51:05 - for that you need to do a bunch of math
51:07 - so I did a
51:10 - uh
51:19 - uh what do I do on the drag and drop
51:22 - yeah basically you need to do
51:26 - yeah drag and drop windows
51:29 - so basically you need to capture the
51:31 - you need to put a button on the corner
51:33 - something that you want to click and
51:35 - then drag so basically you need to
51:36 - listen to a click on that then need to
51:38 - be able to do some math in order to
51:40 - figure out what position how you're
51:41 - going to modify the width and height and
51:43 - so on so look into that video to see how
51:45 - you can click on something and then for
51:48 - the map the math for resizing you can
51:50 - look at the tooltip which just so
51:52 - happens this the only tip that I made in
51:53 - this tutorial in 2020 I'm actually using
51:55 - this in the game so for the various uh
51:58 - totally I'm actually using quite a lot
52:00 - of things that I've covered in a bunch
52:01 - of videos which is it's always fun so
52:03 - yeah if I go into the main menu
52:06 - and if I continue if I go into one of
52:09 - these look at that that tone tip over
52:11 - there that one that automatically scales
52:13 - depending on what text there is Yep this
52:16 - tooltip is exactly the same thing that I
52:17 - covered in this video in 2020 so here I
52:20 - am uh what is it three years later
52:21 - reusing the exact same code in a game so
52:24 - that is really awesome so yeah that is
52:26 - the the power frame good clean code and
52:28 - doing tons of things is that you can
52:30 - then easily reuse them in lots of
52:32 - different places uh all right so let me
52:35 - get my guns over there
52:38 - and okay so I've got the gold text mesh
52:42 - that I'm not going to do it on update
52:44 - but for now let's go text mesh.txt
52:47 - and I need to figure out how am I going
52:50 - to
52:51 - okay so I need
52:54 - a clone then the dinky amount by dinky
52:57 - so I'm going to need to ask the goal
52:59 - manager
53:00 - okay so on this one let's make a goal
53:03 - manager a instance
53:07 - where they get any private sets
53:10 - and up here on price void awake let's
53:12 - set instance equals this okay so then
53:15 - here go manager the instance and I'm
53:18 - going to need to ask so
53:21 - amount
53:25 - and a public end get dinky amount total
53:30 - total
53:34 - you can save on something on canvas
53:35 - instead of making a custom script
53:38 - Staples
53:40 - uh all right so for thank you amount
53:43 - yeah I'm just going to return the denki
53:45 - amount so just return that one total
53:48 - let's return 30 so this is going to be
53:49 - whatever is the funnel goal on the demo
53:52 - then what are the things am I going to
53:54 - need so is rocket build support is
53:58 - rocket built you need to ask this one
54:01 - for all this so is rocket don't it's
54:04 - really just yeah just going to test if
54:06 - that one is not no so just return that
54:08 - one
54:10 - okay the other goal so uh
54:13 - Heavenly uh int get dinky
54:18 - working amount
54:20 - and basically I'm just going to get to
54:22 - the linking list and figure out which
54:24 - ones are working and then I'm going to
54:27 - return this right here so that Returns
54:29 - the dinkies working
54:32 - and is Colony safe so if only if we'll
54:37 - get last
54:39 - uh attack timer
54:43 - return go into the zombie spawner
54:45 - instance get last get time since the
54:48 - last attack
54:50 - okay so I think with that I've got a
54:53 - bunch of these
54:54 - time is time is double because time
54:56 - won't be overflown
54:58 - if you play for several days I don't
55:00 - think anyone's gonna I mean because
55:02 - technically that is true technically
55:04 - that will overflow but
55:08 - what is default Maxim isn't like four
55:10 - billion so how how much are four billion
55:13 - seconds so four billion seconds in days
55:20 - 46 000 days okay am I wrong is not for
55:22 - billing because that seems way too big
55:24 - but yeah either way the maximum float in
55:28 - terms of seconds that is going to be
55:29 - huge so
55:31 - so yeah I don't think time is definitely
55:33 - going to be a necessity but yeah maybe
55:35 - I'll add it just because I mean storing
55:37 - a double or a float doesn't really
55:39 - matter too much uh but yeah
55:45 - their black point at the left bottom of
55:47 - your screen there's a black point not my
55:49 - point
55:57 - all right uh
55:59 - in this two billion 40 is the same boat
56:01 - with floating points yeah yeah it looks
56:03 - accuracy but I mean if it's something
56:06 - oh you're talking about the microphone
56:07 - over here yeah this is the microphone
56:09 - yeah the tiny Point dot yeah uh
56:13 - uh yeah it's more expert it loses
56:15 - Precision but difference between I don't
56:17 - know 0.1 and 0.9 seconds that really
56:20 - does not
56:21 - does not worry too much you need to wait
56:23 - to cancel actions yep there is a way
56:25 - there is a way why no dark mode because
56:27 - dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty
56:30 - much it uh all right okay so over here
56:33 - so let me go so clone uh the 30 dinky so
56:37 - I'm going to
56:40 - oh because I'm using that one right uh
56:42 - right so Pierre was that one dot get the
56:46 - dinky amount
56:48 - close
56:50 - get the dinky amount total
56:53 - okay so that is going to be
56:56 - the thing yeah in the end I'm not going
56:58 - to end up doing this in
57:02 - with text but yeah for now text should
57:06 - be fine so let me just see that okay so
57:09 - then
57:11 - then build rockets and then I can go
57:16 - into the goal manager instance so is
57:20 - rocket built if so then I'm going to
57:23 - return done
57:25 - if not then I'm going to return nothing
57:27 - okay
57:28 - and then a new line
57:30 - I need to put this inside a something
57:34 - okay so the next one is the fully
57:37 - automated Colony so
57:41 - if only automate The Colony
57:45 - and then let me go into the goal manager
57:48 - instance get the dinky working amount
57:53 - ah okay so this is going to be tricky
57:55 - zoom out would be nice yep camera
57:57 - controls are definitely uh something
57:59 - that I wouldn't like yeah that is
58:01 - definitely something that I want to
58:02 - implement just didn't get time to do it
58:04 - over here but yep
58:07 - kind of approach would you use for
58:08 - storing multiple game object wrong
58:10 - position Json a good idea from lots of
58:13 - game objects uh yeah sure I mean it all
58:15 - depends on what you're trying to say but
58:16 - over here for my for my dinkies for
58:19 - example all of them they're storing the
58:21 - position so I can have up to like 50
58:22 - denkis or however and yeah it's not just
58:25 - storing a vector three that stores
58:27 - perfectly fine in a thing a while ago I
58:30 - I showed the uh
58:32 - the uh
58:34 - the save file which has all of those
58:36 - positions so if I go into saves I open
58:38 - up one of these and they're gonna look
58:40 - at that position here is the X here is
58:42 - the Y and here's the set so here's a
58:44 - vector three converted into Json so yep
58:47 - you can definitely store as many of
58:48 - these as you want I mean this looks like
58:50 - a pretty big file and it is a pretty big
58:52 - game quite a bit of that but in reality
58:54 - it's only 30 kilobytes and of course you
58:57 - could obviously optimize this by quite a
58:59 - lot but yeah uh right now 30 count by
59:03 - bites Force I found that is really not
59:04 - something that I'm worried about but
59:06 - yeah uh so yeah if you want to store
59:08 - positions yep Json works perfectly fine
59:11 - for starting quite a lot of them uh okay
59:13 - so over here let me actually
59:16 - uh I'm trying to think of how am I going
59:19 - to
59:21 - do this
59:22 - um
59:24 - do a string
59:26 - fully automate colony
59:30 - something like this it's going to be a
59:32 - bit better
59:33 - because on the dinky amount
59:36 - this one if this one is bigger than zero
59:40 - then what's going to this one and plus
59:43 - equals
59:44 - slash in and say
59:48 - five
59:50 - I think he's working so that should not
59:53 - be like that okay so that is going to be
59:55 - the only automated colony
59:59 - then in your line and finally the last
60:02 - one is just
60:05 - keep Colony safe
60:08 - and then I'm going to go into that one
60:10 - yeah let's do a screen gun so keep
60:15 - keep the colony safe
60:17 - yeah working with strings here not very
60:19 - good but for now just get it working so
60:23 - keep Colony save then let me go into the
60:25 - goal manager the instance and get the
60:28 - what did I call the last attack timer
60:33 - uh
60:35 - I'm trying to think the logic should not
60:37 - be over here on the UI
60:41 - how can you fit all those physics
60:43 - objects we don't like I mean I haven't
60:45 - done anything specific so it's really
60:46 - just uh Unity rigid bodies and the way
60:50 - their physics system works so yeah it
60:52 - could definitely be optimized quite a
60:54 - lot but yeah for now
60:55 - like that
60:59 - should make how to customize buttons you
61:01 - want to like resize or change position
61:03 - on the screen like mobile
61:04 - player have the option to change the
61:06 - button I mean that is mostly just
61:09 - it's really just modifying the the scale
61:12 - of the object so you can access the rec
61:13 - transform you can modify the position
61:15 - the anchor the width so you can modify
61:18 - the size down so that was what I was
61:19 - doing a while ago on this script the
61:21 - reset position script this grow goes
61:23 - into the direct transform and grabs the
61:24 - anchor position and the size Delta so
61:27 - yeah that's pretty much what you would
61:28 - do in terms of logic it's not complex
61:30 - it's just a ton of work you'd have to
61:33 - Define like like for example so you
61:36 - would have like a switch on some kind of
61:38 - private enum for the UI UI size UI size
61:44 - you have small
61:46 - small medium and large you would have
61:49 - something like this and then you do a UI
61:53 - size UI size
61:56 - something like this and you would do a
61:58 - switch on the UI size in case it is UI
62:01 - size dot small okay this you would go
62:03 - into the right transform and set the
62:05 - size Delta to I don't know something
62:07 - like maybe on small you've got 30 by 30
62:09 - then on something like a medium you
62:13 - would have perhaps 50 by 50 and this one
62:17 - you would have 100 by 100 so that's
62:20 - pretty much what you would do you just
62:22 - Define the sizes then just going to rec
62:24 - transform modified size Delta maybe also
62:26 - modify the anchored position so yeah in
62:28 - terms of logic it is pretty simple it's
62:30 - just quite uh quite verbose right on
62:33 - this code so I would probably make a
62:35 - mono Behavior component something to
62:38 - hold on data so for saying Okay so this
62:40 - component when it's small it should be
62:42 - on this size when it's medium should be
62:44 - on this one this one so on so for that
62:46 - you could actually just make a
62:48 - serialized field of a private Vector 2
62:50 - for the small size and medium size and
62:53 - so on then you could set this in the
62:54 - editor something like that so yeah
62:56 - so in terms of doing that it's uh pretty
62:59 - simple just takes quite a bit of work
63:15 - here
63:16 - all right uh okay
63:20 - uh right so what I was doing uh I was on
63:24 - the
63:25 - on the girls UI okay get the last type
63:27 - of timer so
63:29 - public boom is
63:31 - Colony safe
63:35 - uh so private operate mode
63:40 - okay maybe a Content I don't know put it
63:43 - here so private mode so Colony save
63:47 - timer
63:48 - so get the colony save timer and let's
63:51 - say the colony is safe after 10 seconds
63:53 - just make it easier to test is Colony
63:55 - saves so return get the last attack
63:58 - timer if it is bigger then is called
64:00 - then the get Colony save timer if so
64:04 - then the colony is safe uh
64:07 - okay so we're here so for the keep the
64:09 - colony safe okay so is Colony safe
64:13 - so if it is safe then let's go into this
64:16 - one
64:18 - and just use equals safe
64:22 - uh if not
64:25 - then I'm going to go into that one and
64:28 - add
64:29 - actually let me add a new line
64:32 - last attack
64:35 - then go into the goal manager instance
64:38 - get the last attack timer and this one
64:40 - is going to need a two string and I
64:43 - always forget the format for the two
64:44 - string
64:45 - is it pound two no I think it's N2 or F2
64:50 - yeah I think it's F2 or no because
64:52 - that's
64:53 - actually I don't want that yeah now that
64:55 - I'm thinking about it yeah I really just
64:57 - round to end
64:59 - I've got round to end yeah that is going
65:02 - to be enough so let's check on something
65:04 - and then I print
65:06 - so keep Colony safe just print down okay
65:09 - so I think that is going to be the basic
65:11 - text okay and then launch into the space
65:13 - okay let me just add that one
65:17 - so just over here
65:20 - just drop launch into space okay
65:26 - uh
65:28 - all right so I do think the logic should
65:31 - be working
65:35 - all right
65:39 - uh okay so this one should be updating
65:42 - that one
65:43 - the only thing is this one was moving
65:45 - quite a bit
65:47 - wasn't it I think it was
65:52 - okay that's a bit
65:54 - strange
65:56 - the position of the UI because it was
65:58 - maybe four instead of round two tomorrow
66:00 - yeah I I guess uh why is this one
66:04 - showing up in there did I how did I mess
66:06 - up the
66:10 - okay now that's a bit confusing
66:12 - oh never mind because of scale right
66:14 - yeah I modified the scale
66:16 - because it was way too big
66:20 - yeah with skin like that it's going to
66:21 - overlap the control so I'm going to need
66:23 - to modify the controls a little bit
66:26 - yeah why don't you use string formatting
66:28 - with the string interpolation thing uh
66:30 - the answer is simply just because
66:32 - uh by the time that I
66:35 - learned about that one I'm already so
66:37 - used to using just the uh regular plus
66:40 - adding something so yeah the answer is
66:42 - really just just uh being way too used
66:47 - uh
66:49 - just using that for way too long that is
66:50 - really the only answer so if you like
66:52 - that by all means you string
66:53 - interpolation because it is quite a bit
66:55 - easier uh okay so I'm trying to figure
66:57 - ah crap yeah never mind about that ah
67:00 - now I'm clicking everywhere uh all right
67:03 - so that is way too big but I don't care
67:04 - let's just see if it is working
67:08 - okay so let's go back outside
67:11 - let's go in let's continue
67:14 - and let's see all right clone 730 build
67:16 - rocket done fully automate colony
67:20 - and it is apparently fully automated but
67:22 - if I turn one of these to feed some
67:25 - dinkies so let's go do something start
67:27 - the other and there you go one thing key
67:29 - is working
67:30 - okay so the logic is working which is
67:32 - only matters I'm going to obviously need
67:34 - to modify
67:35 - the actual
67:37 - uh logic that's not supposed to be in
67:40 - text but yep that is pretty much it so
67:42 - for the
67:43 - let's just add some colors just for fun
67:46 - uh so red green blue is the color and
67:51 - color
67:53 - and over here for
67:55 - color equals uh let me get an orange so
67:58 - let me figure out some color over here
68:03 - we go into one of these just pick up
68:07 - some kind of like an orange red
68:10 - yeah something like this is a good color
68:12 - okay so let's put down so let's see
68:15 - Conway 40 and less attack
68:17 - color
68:19 - and for dinky's working let me do the
68:22 - same thing so if there are I think he's
68:23 - working
68:24 - you do that and
68:28 - uh if not
68:31 - let me just yeah because I want to put
68:33 - see
68:36 - right because yeah I'm doing that one
68:39 - was equals the done
68:42 - safe done something
68:46 - so fully automate the quality just
68:49 - uh yep just like that so keep the colony
68:51 - safe so keep it safe build the rocket
68:54 - and so on and get the denki amount
68:57 - Stone and build the rocket and done let
69:00 - me just
69:02 - just do that
69:04 - just putting some color just a bit of
69:06 - fun just in case some of you don't know
69:07 - you can use tags in your text which is a
69:11 - nice and easy way to add a little bit of
69:13 - Polish to the text without having to
69:15 - make anything special you can just see
69:17 - include Rich Text tags and everything
69:19 - works and a super Channel thank you
69:21 - Rafael hey thank you
69:24 - have you seen the game captains of
69:25 - industry uh I'm pretty sure I've seen of
69:27 - it but I haven't uh I haven't played it
69:31 - but yeah I'm pretty sure
69:33 - I'm pretty sure I saw that one in one of
69:35 - my one of my oh look at that there's my
69:38 - is that my stream yeah there it is so it
69:41 - is working that's great uh
69:44 - yeah is that the one with pixels or
69:47 - something
69:49 - yeah I'm pretty sure I saw this one oh
69:51 - it's this one okay yeah I thought it was
69:53 - another one that has a bunch of voxels
69:56 - and things yeah
69:57 - oh yeah this is the one where you can
69:59 - mine everywhere yeah I remember seeing
70:01 - this one when it came out 31 of May 22
70:04 - Yeah quite a while ago uh they have very
70:07 - interesting terrain mechanics that I
70:08 - can't figure out uh well for that it's
70:11 - really going to depend on what kind of
70:12 - terrain system you're using I do know
70:15 - that unity's ring system has quite a few
70:18 - limitations
70:20 - so yeah only now I noticed that
70:23 - apparently my camera is
70:27 - yeah only now I noticed that the camera
70:29 - over here the green screen isn't
70:31 - all right
70:34 - yeah only now I noticed that but anyways
70:36 - sure fine
70:38 - stone is
70:40 - still a little bit like that uh anyways
70:42 - uh yeah so that is going to very much
70:44 - depend on what kind of
70:46 - terrain system you're using
70:50 - because yeah they dig all of this
70:51 - because yeah digging to rain in real
70:54 - time that is actually something that is
70:56 - quite complex so yeah I would assume
70:59 - they're using something custom rather
71:00 - than the built-in Unity because I'm
71:04 - pretty sure this is the ENT game but
71:05 - yeah yeah for that it even looks like
71:07 - they've got some kind of
71:09 - voxel grid based terrain the way the
71:12 - terrain is adding in and decreasing
71:14 - seems to be voxel based so
71:18 - yeah maybe that's it maybe you make a
71:21 - Vox on less terrain and pretty much just
71:23 - destroy each chunk at a time so
71:27 - yeah that's definitely one yeah look at
71:29 - that all the levels are very much
71:31 - individualized so they're not very much
71:33 - analog they're either got a home or
71:36 - don't have a home that's pretty much it
71:37 - so
71:40 - but yeah that that is pretty much going
71:41 - to depend on what kind of yeah because
71:43 - even the even the buildings seem to be
71:45 - on like a 3D Vauxhall grid so yeah if I
71:48 - had to guess I would say that I would
71:49 - say the terrain and the entire world has
71:51 - some kind of 3D grid which you can
71:53 - either put some dirt or put nothing on
71:55 - it so
71:58 - yep that pretty much seems to be like
72:00 - that so yeah that that's where I would
72:02 - start my research is how to make some
72:04 - voxel uh terrain thing with quite a bit
72:07 - of
72:08 - with some very good performance which
72:10 - actually right now with dots having just
72:12 - hit 1.0 that would be the perfect thing
72:14 - for doing something like this I mean if
72:16 - you've got a large World using dots
72:18 - using a data oriented approach for
72:20 - storing the the terrain being able to
72:23 - cut it down and build it up that would
72:25 - definitely be
72:27 - my Approach so yeah
72:28 - yeah who knows I mean I would love to do
72:30 - some research on on dots and doing a
72:33 - Terrain system kind of like this could
72:35 - be a fun challenge so yeah thanks for
72:37 - the tip that is really interesting yeah
72:40 - yeah that's part of the reason why I
72:41 - don't like to uh keep doing my series on
72:44 - trying to find uh interesting new
72:47 - releases made with unity it's really
72:49 - just to see what can be done with the
72:51 - engine only that a zombie just spawn
72:53 - look at that that one is terrifying
72:54 - because
72:55 - um yeah so basically checking those
72:57 - checking new releases probably great to
72:59 - be able to see what other people have
73:00 - done with the engine ah crap you go
73:03 - okay
73:05 - just punch them all uh all right so yeah
73:08 - that one is working so build the rocket
73:09 - done fully automate keep the colony safe
73:12 - and yeah I guess the only thing is
73:16 - yeah right for the keep the colony safe
73:20 - uh for that one
73:24 - if my game make a hundred they didn't
73:26 - take 30 dollars
73:28 - Unity doesn't take uh Commission on
73:31 - anything so are you asking about steam
73:33 - because yes in that case yes if you make
73:37 - a hundred bucks of gross revenue on
73:39 - Steam then seem does indeed take 30
73:40 - percent but Yount doesn't take anything
73:43 - so you can make whatever you want and
73:45 - you know
73:47 - oh yeah I mentioned that dots 1.0 has
73:50 - memory leak really well that's tricky
73:53 - that is definitely going to erase any
73:55 - performance benefits yeah that would be
73:58 - quite tricky
74:03 - then C sharp series I mean if you want
74:05 - Advanced my turn-based strategy course
74:08 - I'm really proud of that course I really
74:10 - think it's a great one really goes for
74:12 - more intermediate users so if you're
74:15 - more on the intermittent level I would
74:17 - say definitely look into that one
74:20 - because yeah in terms of C sharp I don't
74:22 - have anything just on C sharp but yeah C
74:24 - sharp coupled with the game that would
74:26 - be my advice
74:31 - the new input system and Odin in your
74:33 - games I do use the new input system
74:35 - although I do it just like I covered in
74:38 - my in my free course which is first I
74:40 - start by just using the input measure
74:42 - which is exactly what I'm using here
74:43 - over here this game which is right now
74:46 - in the alpha demo Sage this one is still
74:48 - just using the input manager then at
74:50 - some point I'm going to refactor into
74:51 - using the new input system so yep I
74:54 - start with the input manager then
74:55 - eventually I I move up and in terms of
74:59 - Odin uh on this game I haven't really
75:01 - had a reason to use it because it
75:03 - doesn't really have way too much that
75:05 - needs I just made a simple editor's work
75:08 - just once but yeah for the most part on
75:11 - this one doesn't really I've got tons of
75:13 - sort of modules so maybe it would be
75:14 - useful to use Odin to make a tune to
75:17 - like make them but even though I've got
75:19 - a ton of script and objects these were
75:21 - all very much made slowly over time so
75:24 - there never was a point when I'm like
75:26 - okay so I need to build like 50
75:27 - scriptable objects so yeah that didn't
75:30 - really happen so I didn't really have a
75:32 - need for a tool to make that part super
75:34 - easy to add so yeah right now I'm using
75:38 - the input Venture but I won't be using
75:39 - the input system in terms of Odin I
75:42 - don't know maybe if I get to a point
75:43 - where I need a
75:45 - where I need to do a ton of things maybe
75:48 - but yeah all right
75:52 - uh
75:55 - Okay so
75:57 - Yeah so basically just with this it is
75:59 - working just on the keep Colony safe the
76:01 - one thing that I do want to
76:03 - uh check is keep Colony save is meant to
76:06 - be safe automatically it is not meant to
76:08 - be so let me just pause this just so
76:10 - this doesn't save anything
76:12 - um
76:14 - so the thing with this one is that it's
76:16 - meant to be automatic because basically
76:17 - over here I'm testing for the time since
76:20 - the last attack
76:21 - but
76:24 - but I want to make sure that the defense
76:26 - is automatic that's basically what I
76:27 - want to do I want to to encourage the
76:29 - player to make the colony fully
76:31 - self-sustainable including with the
76:32 - fence so the player is not meant to
76:34 - actually attack anything
76:37 - so I need to keep track of hmm
76:44 - okay so let me think uh
76:48 - so I need like a
76:55 - yeah I guess I just need another one so
76:58 - I got the last time attack
77:01 - uh so this is the last
77:04 - zombie time attack and then I've got
77:06 - another one for the last player time
77:08 - attack okay then on this one second last
77:13 - Zoom be time attack okay
77:16 - and then I'm going to have one for the
77:19 - set last for the player time attack so
77:23 - the last
77:25 - player time attack
77:27 - because basically I need oh no that's
77:30 - sectionally tricky because the player
77:31 - can actually attack with quite a bit of
77:33 - things no with the factory pattern I'm
77:36 - familiar with it but I always forget
77:37 - about it so yeah I don't know it off top
77:40 - of my head for creating instances of
77:41 - classical objects seem similar better
77:44 - than the basic Constructor uh yeah I
77:47 - know of the factory pattern but I've
77:49 - never actually used it uh and nowadays I
77:53 - really don't normally use the base
77:54 - Constructor so for script margin like
77:56 - for example like carry object so
77:58 - uh where's the definition
78:01 - so here it is I just make a certain
78:03 - object with a create asset menu so I
78:05 - don't even use any
78:06 - I don't use anything special for
78:08 - creating it so I just go over here into
78:10 - one of these going to create and here
78:12 - are all my scribbling objects so if I
78:14 - want to make a tune carry object I just
78:16 - make one of these if I want to make a
78:17 - new text so this is the research I just
78:19 - did one of these our new crafting recipe
78:21 - and so on
78:22 - so yeah I've never really used the
78:25 - factory pattern I know it's interesting
78:27 - and sometimes useful but yeah stream
78:30 - dying is it dying
78:32 - it's saying excellent connection so
78:33 - apparently it's what is dying is my
78:36 - throat so yeah that's normal
78:41 - and I'm running out of water so yeah
78:43 - okay let me just
78:46 - uh try to see this I'm quite a bit
78:50 - the strike today I have to say doing
78:52 - live streams is fun but it definitely is
78:55 - quite physically demanding and it does
78:57 - take uh
78:59 - does make me quite a bit less productive
79:02 - what network SDK are you using I'm using
79:04 - netcode for game objects so basically
79:06 - the idea why I started making this game
79:08 - was because I was making my free
79:10 - multiplayer course where I use net code
79:12 - for game objects to make a multiplayer
79:14 - game and I really enjoyed it so that is
79:16 - why I decided to make this game I really
79:18 - wanted to make something in multiplayer
79:19 - so yep and so far it has been very good
79:22 - I've been using it and I had a few
79:25 - strange very random issues but for the
79:28 - most part it has been very good very
79:30 - nice yeah
79:31 - complaining unit of course on kitchen
79:33 - chaos hey good luck yeah that's awesome
79:36 - yeah I hope you'll learn a lot yeah that
79:38 - course has been really nice a lot of
79:39 - people have really enjoyed it so
79:41 - yeah I'm glad people are enjoying it pop
79:44 - your head with water yeah that's a
79:46 - I really prefer this bottle as opposed
79:49 - to a twisty thing so that is so much
79:51 - more efficient super easy to open and
79:53 - close real nice okay so the player on
79:56 - last time attack so basically I just
79:58 - need to go and once again thanks so much
80:00 - for the Super Chat I hope my answer
80:02 - helped so look into voxels perhaps with
80:05 - dots and that's basically how I would
80:08 - try it I think that would be pretty good
80:12 - Unity company isn't near you I'm pretty
80:14 - sure Unity does not have offices over
80:17 - here in Portugal so nope
80:19 - I wonder what is the closest one
80:21 - do they have one in Spain I don't think
80:24 - so so I think the closest would probably
80:25 - be their offices in either London or
80:28 - Berlin not sure which one is is closer
80:30 - so yeah and unite is going to be in
80:34 - Amsterdam this year so that's going to
80:36 - be fun yeah
80:37 - I hope they don't be able to attend so
80:39 - that should be that should be
80:40 - interesting uh all right okay so
80:43 - uh now I'm just trying to figure out how
80:46 - do I
80:49 - okay so that's actually on the zombie
80:51 - I'm trying to remember how do I handle
80:52 - the damage
80:54 - it's over here so for taking damage yeah
80:57 - because I got a damage
80:58 - but I don't have oh right it's on the
81:01 - Canon tract so on try interact
81:05 - this is the one that is going to
81:08 - all right because this is one of the
81:10 - first ones
81:13 - okay then cut a stream yeah a random
81:15 - stream let's be Portuguese yep I mean
81:18 - I'm right here born here so yep even
81:22 - though honestly my brain works more in
81:24 - English and does important she is but
81:26 - yeah I do I pretty much only use
81:28 - Portuguese when when in real life so
81:31 - like going to gym talking to someone
81:33 - talking to a friend yeah that's pretty
81:35 - much the only time that I use Portuguese
81:38 - everything else always with English uh
81:40 - okay so
81:43 - on the try to interact I'm just trying
81:44 - to see am I going to do it here or on
81:46 - the other one and I guess this is always
81:48 - going to run on the server so put on the
81:51 - server I don't have that
81:54 - okay so this is a bit tricky
81:58 - hmm
82:02 - okay so that's a bit tricky
82:07 - but actually
82:09 - no because yeah I'm trying to think okay
82:11 - so I interact in order to deal on damage
82:12 - to the zombies
82:13 - but
82:16 - yeah right the only one that ever uses
82:18 - this the dinkies are never going to
82:19 - attack the zombies and the automated
82:21 - Bots those are also not going to attack
82:24 - the zombie so
82:25 - yeah sure so I think in here on the
82:27 - server I've seen I can just go into the
82:29 - zombie spawner the instance and set the
82:32 - last player time attack because this one
82:33 - is only ever going to be called for the
82:36 - thing
82:36 - shout out please you want me to shout I
82:39 - don't think my voice can handle shouting
82:41 - universe or Mainland I'm in Mainland
82:43 - you're in Lisbon so yeah
82:45 - are you planning to finance your game in
82:47 - the long term
82:48 - can happen that the TNT Services costs
82:50 - eat up your income at some point uh not
82:52 - really I mean so far the demo has gone
82:55 - pretty decently I think I've had like
82:57 - 1500 people playing the demo something
82:59 - like that and basically it is still well
83:01 - within the uh three tiers so yeah so far
83:05 - with a bunch of people playing on relay
83:07 - a bunch of people using the lobby and uh
83:11 - I'm still on the on the free tier so I
83:13 - still don't have to pay one cent so I
83:16 - don't think that is going to be an issue
83:17 - the free tiers on the Unity gaming
83:19 - Services tools those three tiers are I
83:22 - would say pre-gen uh pretty generous so
83:24 - yep that is so yeah basically I'm not
83:28 - too worried about it I'm going to keep
83:29 - using them and I do think they won't
83:31 - work quite well okay
83:33 - so set the last player time attack
83:39 - okay yet time since the last
83:42 - Zoom be attack and then I needed another
83:45 - one
83:45 - for get time since the last
83:48 - player attack so the last
83:51 - player attack
83:53 - and basically on the goals on the goal
83:56 - manager so the last
83:58 - so
84:00 - so in order to Define if the colony is
84:01 - safe
84:02 - I need to see
84:05 - both of them right
84:07 - so get the last
84:10 - zombie attack timer
84:12 - if it is bigger than that one and the
84:14 - get the last player attack timer and
84:18 - this one is going to be pretty much the
84:19 - exact same thing
84:21 - so get the last player attack timer
84:24 - so get time since last player attack
84:28 - so if that one
84:30 - is also under the get Colony save time
84:33 - or not others that one is above if so
84:36 - then that means it has been more than 10
84:38 - seconds since either a zombie attack or
84:41 - a player attacked the zombie
84:43 - so if I do that then yeah I do think
84:46 - that's Logic for getting the colony safe
84:47 - okay great been enjoying tears of the
84:50 - Kingdom I was until I until like four
84:54 - weeks ago when I started really uh
84:56 - sprinting to get the demo done in time
84:58 - and since then I haven't touched the
85:01 - game yet so yeah now now that the
85:03 - festival is over which should be over
85:05 - right now at 6 PM is it over uh where's
85:08 - my
85:09 - where's my thing
85:12 - store.steampower.com is the festival
85:13 - over okay so apparently the festival is
85:16 - already over so yeah now that the
85:18 - festival is over the Sprint pretty much
85:19 - ends so hopefully for the rest of this
85:22 - week I can get back to
85:26 - uh doing it a bit more calm and look at
85:29 - that the only stream is on there that's
85:30 - one uh yeah oh and by the way I'm not uh
85:34 - removing the demo so if you want to see
85:38 - the updates that I've been seeing I'm
85:39 - going to try to push another update
85:40 - today so yeah if you want to see that uh
85:44 - definitely I'm going to leave the demo
85:46 - up so feel free to download it and go
85:48 - ahead and add it to your wish list
85:49 - because that really does help uh all
85:52 - right so let me just quickly uh test out
85:54 - what I was doing
85:56 - so
85:58 - let's say okay so one two three four
86:00 - five seconds
86:02 - six seven eight nine and ten any up now
86:07 - the colony is safe okay so now let me
86:08 - spawn a zombie so let me spawn a Zoomy
86:11 - and once again let me sacrifice one of
86:14 - these linkies so sorry about that but
86:16 - okay so let's go
86:18 - find the zombie there it is throw them
86:20 - there okay so let's see that one still
86:23 - safe now let's attack in one second okay
86:26 - so now it's going to go like that okay
86:28 - now if I punch him it should actually
86:30 - reset that so if I reset
86:32 - and nope oh no but yes yeah exactly
86:36 - because now it's going above 10 12. so
86:39 - now it's going to say safe
86:41 - okay now it says save and I'll punch him
86:43 - and still says that okay so I just gotta
86:46 - update the timer but yeah pretty much
86:48 - that does work don't have any Minds
86:51 - I need to make some Minds uh
86:55 - okay so yeah if I attack him okay that's
86:57 - good that means that reset the timer
86:59 - which is good so right now I've gotten
87:01 - logic in order to be able to ensure that
87:02 - the colony is some sustaining so if I
87:04 - attack a zombie it becomes unsafe if a
87:07 - zombie attacks a denki it becomes unsafe
87:09 - so that's great that's his own logic
87:11 - that I want
87:12 - uh just need to go there on the uh I'm
87:15 - going to go and see why
87:18 - it's on the keep Colony safe uh unless
87:21 - attack
87:23 - do I pick the smallest or the biggest
87:25 - the smallest right
87:29 - yeah I think it is a small so math F dot
87:31 - Min pick the smallest between the get
87:34 - last zombie attack timer and get the
87:38 - last player attack timer so pick the
87:41 - smallest of those and yep that's time
87:42 - all right so that's the logic working
87:48 - all right I'm out of water so just gonna
87:51 - be a little bit
87:53 - are there classes for dinkies in the
87:55 - game uh you mean like different
87:58 - abilities uh not really although uh they
88:01 - all do different things so I can expect
88:04 - they I can tell them to do all kinds of
88:06 - things so I can tell dinky to follow me
88:07 - which I think is a a pretty fun thing so
88:10 - like for example if I wanted to make a
88:12 - new thing I can go up tell them hey
88:13 - carry some apples and let's go and build
88:16 - a brand new Outpost over on the side so
88:18 - I can tell them to follow me which is
88:20 - pretty fun I can tell them to fit some
88:22 - dinkies add power interact with machines
88:24 - get resource notes grab objects or move
88:26 - some crates so yep they can do quite a
88:29 - lot of things so not really classes
88:31 - they're all just one dinky but they can
88:33 - do all kinds of things and look at that
88:35 - one thank you working because they
88:37 - cannot be following me so let's put this
88:38 - one back into idle any of them now the
88:41 - colony is fully automated
88:43 - okay
88:45 - C sharp string interpolation yeah I know
88:47 - I just never I just never got used to
88:50 - that so I just do close at the points
88:52 - that just feels uh very automatic
88:54 - premium very automatic to me by now yeah
89:01 - does the player take damage from enemies
89:03 - like in factorio uh nope for uh I really
89:06 - wanted to focus more on actually
89:08 - damaging dinky so you don't like have to
89:11 - protect them but I don't know that's
89:13 - when those design questions that really
89:15 - the answer only comes after play testing
89:17 - so
89:18 - who knows maybe didn't I have some Minds
89:21 - over here no no no no no go away
89:24 - all right so yeah it's the combat that
89:26 - obviously still needs quite a bit of
89:28 - work I still need to make uh actual
89:31 - spawn points for where the zombies are
89:33 - going to come from I think that is going
89:35 - to be much better in order to make it
89:38 - okay like for example lets you keep the
89:40 - colony safe so if I make a bunch of let
89:44 - me spawn a few uh let me spawn a bunch
89:46 - of Chase mines
89:47 - and let me also spawn a zombie sorry for
89:50 - example that one says save so if I punch
89:52 - that one it is going to suddenly become
89:54 - unsafe but if I take a mine
89:57 - and if he gets killed either with the
90:00 - mine or with the tower the one should
90:01 - not reset so there it goes boom any up
90:04 - it does now reset all right awesome
90:08 - so the logic does work okay so I just
90:10 - need to
90:11 - figure out play around with the visual
90:12 - as well a little bit but yep
90:15 - multiple courses which one do you
90:17 - recommend most for someone
90:18 - that wants to make type of games you are
90:21 - making uh that really depends on your
90:23 - skill set where you are but I would
90:25 - recommend starting with my free complete
90:28 - course so this one is completely free
90:29 - you can watch it on YouTube it's 10
90:31 - hours long so if you're a beginner I
90:33 - would say start with that one and if
90:35 - you're more of an advanced user I would
90:37 - recommend the turn based strategy course
90:38 - this one goes on making quite a bit more
90:40 - complex game
90:42 - so it covers lots of more advanced
90:44 - things so it's a game kind of like XCOM
90:46 - so you start you play in a grid you do
90:49 - all kinds of things you've got all kinds
90:51 - of actions you've got enemies grenades
90:53 - things ragdolls it's a pre-fun game
90:56 - definitely involves quite a lot more
90:57 - complexity so if you're a more advanced
91:00 - user maybe look into this course but if
91:02 - you're a beginner then just start with
91:03 - my free course just that one will teach
91:06 - you quite a lot okay
91:09 - what time are we doing Emoji rates the
91:11 - rest of my text doesn't
91:14 - you mean over here on my overlay because
91:16 - yeah the uh the thing over here text
91:19 - mesh Pro this one probably does not
91:21 - recognize emojis so yeah
91:22 - which one of your workout monkey oh
91:24 - that's awesome start my own gaming
91:26 - company and build games that is cool
91:28 - nice let's see you have a webcam now
91:30 - yeah always imagining this little monkey
91:34 - talking super fast yep I am human I am
91:37 - indeed human all right thanks for being
91:39 - here thanks for watching the video so
91:41 - I'm glad I'm glad they've been useful to
91:42 - you uh okay so let me just figure out
91:45 - just the visuals in that
91:48 - and
91:50 - actually the rocket that one is not done
91:52 - only now I realize how to make the dark
91:55 - outlines and all the objects that is I'm
91:57 - using the equivali anime shaders and
92:00 - tools so if you want this is the exact
92:03 - asset that I'm using in the game in
92:04 - order to make it look
92:06 - quite interesting and this asset also
92:08 - has a bunch of outlines yeah
92:11 - went through your turn-based strategy
92:12 - course it was a huge help on the card
92:15 - game based off the grid system oh nice a
92:17 - lot of ideas and Implement oh that's
92:19 - awesome hey congrats on completing the
92:21 - course and using it to make something
92:23 - original yeah congrats that it's really
92:25 - awesome nice
92:26 - and she get me and my entire friend
92:28 - group into game development ah that is
92:30 - awesome that is really cool
92:32 - I love seeing those kinds of comments
92:33 - yeah that's awesome what the video sound
92:35 - uh
92:37 - all right okay so let me just let me
92:39 - just visually work on that
92:42 - and yeah then it's probably gonna be it
92:45 - because my voice only quite a bit messed
92:47 - up it's already past 6 p.m so I still
92:50 - got to clean up a bunch of things so
92:52 - yeah
92:53 - uh okay so let me just
92:57 - let me go figure that out and just play
93:00 - with the visual little bits let me go
93:03 - into the goal and see why
93:04 - so I gotta scale it down by a little bit
93:08 - yeah this is actually going to be quite
93:10 - tricky yeah because I was making it 70
93:12 - by 70.
93:15 - uh
93:16 - well actually for the because can I
93:20 - move the next I got the controls over
93:23 - here but the controls can definitely
93:24 - move a little bit okay so
93:28 - I think I just moved the controls a
93:29 - little bit just over here if it's on 20
93:32 - is this still readable yeah it's still
93:33 - readable
93:35 - all right so yeah let's put just on 18
93:39 - okay right now obviously I'm going to
93:41 - come up with a proper thing but for now
93:46 - okay so for now put it to the 18 let me
93:48 - just well let me first just copy the
93:51 - controls UI so copy this component stop
93:54 - playing let me go into the control c y
93:57 - let me paste this component values and
94:01 - for the other one for the goals UI for
94:03 - the guns text let's put it whether I put
94:05 - 18
94:06 - something like that
94:08 - put check marks in front yeah that's
94:10 - that's good I do think text mesh Pro
94:13 - does support some emojis but I don't
94:15 - know
94:15 - how many so yeah we'll see but um
94:20 - you know let me just make it just a
94:22 - little bit
94:24 - smaller on that one and yeah
94:27 - okay but actually I still need to figure
94:30 - out how am I going to
94:32 - because that one says don't rock it but
94:34 - that is actually not true yeah the
94:36 - rocket is still one part that is not
94:38 - fully built
94:40 - because I still I made all the logic but
94:42 - I haven't yet handled all the costs of
94:44 - the all the various things
94:47 - uh but the stage yeah that's it he goes
94:50 - I do think that
94:52 - it already works
94:54 - but
94:56 - uh
94:59 - okay so let's go here's the public boom
95:02 - is rocket only built
95:06 - just return if the stage equals the the
95:11 - Nikon stage what the record I called it
95:13 - Sage
95:14 - try not save the stage
95:16 - stage dot done
95:22 - try not oh right because I put it stage
95:24 - it's a network variable
95:26 - ah crap let's go down
95:29 - uh the stage dot value if that one is
95:32 - done so the rocket is fully built so on
95:34 - the goal manager so is rocket build down
95:38 - if that one is not known and rocket
95:41 - go in the rocket base
95:43 - rocketbase dot instance that is the
95:46 - rocket form we don't if so it is fully
95:48 - Bond if not then I need to build it okay
95:53 - all right so yeah that should be working
95:56 - except yeah the rocket Stone does not
95:59 - have any cost so I still need to add the
96:01 - one UI and so on
96:05 - horizontal grid layout to Auto size
96:08 - for your UI uh yeah I am using those in
96:12 - quite a few places but yeah uh right now
96:15 - for the UI I'm really just looking for
96:17 - the most basic thing possible
96:19 - right now polishing DUI isn't really
96:21 - something that I'm worried too much
96:23 - about I'm just
96:24 - first of all focus on getting everything
96:26 - working and then I'll focus on actually
96:28 - polishing things okay so build rocket
96:30 - now that one does not say that it's done
96:32 - because it's not done and I need to once
96:36 - again the UI this needs to be updated
96:37 - because right now it doesn't say what
96:39 - are the costs for the rocket
96:41 - so I'm going to need to play around with
96:43 - that by quite a lot so let me pick up
96:46 - some of these create containers
96:49 - and just put a bunch of them
96:52 - okay so let's just see if this works
96:56 - it should be working
97:00 - for single player same time for
97:02 - multiplayer yep everything here is
97:03 - working both in single player and
97:05 - multiplier yeah thanks to using netcode
97:07 - for game objects this is actually
97:09 - surprisingly easy I mean you just make
97:11 - something work you just create a local
97:13 - instance and it automatically works just
97:16 - in single player okay none of them have
97:18 - green crystals let me grab some green
97:20 - cursors there's a ton of them over here
97:24 - so let's go I think this one has five
97:27 - things
97:31 - none of them have some food so let's put
97:33 - some food
97:35 - all right so I need to show these costs
97:37 - but yeah oh I put a progress bar I
97:40 - forgot about that that's good
97:43 - okay yeah so I think this one is let me
97:45 - actually just
97:46 - inspect the rocket
97:50 - the rocket based loan let me put this on
97:52 - debug View
97:54 - so on the rocket base here are the costs
97:57 - so then just yeah I put just one gem
97:59 - green so right now it's on
98:02 - oh interesting the stage that one stores
98:05 - as an INT instead of the text so that's
98:07 - fun that is interesting
98:10 - uh so yeah it is on internal value 2
98:12 - which means that it can still go one
98:14 - more
98:17 - so I think this is the enlistment so
98:19 - zero one two three yeah I think that one
98:21 - so as soon as I finish that one the
98:23 - build rocket that one should say done
98:25 - did I do that I think I did that
98:27 - and nope so we got one more okay stage
98:30 - three
98:31 - so if I go to the end this one it should
98:33 - go into stage four which is done and
98:35 - that one should be done and there you go
98:36 - done all right awesome so internal value
98:39 - done okay so actually just named it
98:41 - easily that because that one says the
98:43 - done and done
98:46 - so yeah I named zero one two three all
98:49 - right yep
98:50 - okay so yeah that logic works all right
98:52 - so I do need to somehow show the cost I
98:55 - need to do some design work in order to
98:57 - come up with some proper cause for all
98:59 - these so that is going to be
99:01 - question that I need to do and show
99:03 - those cards to the players so they know
99:04 - what to build and with that then I just
99:06 - need to clone the rest of dinkies once
99:09 - those are done then all the goals will
99:10 - be done then just interact this in order
99:12 - to go outside yep
99:15 - sometimes get lost between all the lines
99:17 - and codes in your scripts uh sometimes
99:20 - but over here in Visual Studio something
99:22 - really useful is a shortcut control and
99:24 - comma and over here you can search for
99:26 - all kinds of things for example I don't
99:28 - remember when is uh when am I spawning
99:31 - some zombies so just search for Zoomy
99:33 - and then look and over again I see okay
99:35 - I've got a zombie class then I've got
99:37 - some zombie events and I've got a zombie
99:40 - spawners and be Visual and so on I can
99:43 - then search for dinky and see all the
99:45 - references where I'm referencing denki
99:47 - so tons of things tons of events dinky
99:50 - Network managers on lots of things so
99:52 - yeah so this search bar over here if you
99:55 - ever forget something that is really
99:57 - really useful so that's control comma if
100:00 - you're on Visual Studio it is super
100:01 - useful okay I'm out of water and my
100:04 - mouth is messed up so
100:08 - okay so I think that's gonna be it so I
100:12 - did a little bit of work
100:13 - not as much as I would like but still it
100:16 - was all right so I just gotta finish
100:17 - this up in order to make another
100:20 - in order to make another update and then
100:22 - that should be interesting but yep at
100:25 - least right now logic done done so
100:27 - getting all those goals that did indeed
100:30 - work so
100:31 - this was indeed correct so the time take
100:34 - that did work correctly
100:36 - okay all right so
100:38 - that's gonna be it that was fun that was
100:41 - interesting I need to drink some more
100:42 - and so on okay so let me just
100:44 - enable the background and
100:47 - just do that all right
100:50 - uh
100:52 - it's your birthday it's in May and can
100:54 - we see doggo I mean they're both asleep
100:55 - so nope sorry that doesn't work uh all
100:59 - right I wish you would get some feedback
101:01 - as to your game yep I definitely I
101:03 - definitely want to but yes still haven't
101:05 - had the time there are so many things
101:07 - that I'm trying to do so yeah so for now
101:08 - if you've got some feedback you can just
101:11 - post on these theme forums or in my
101:13 - YouTube comments and I'll make sure to
101:15 - see it and thank you so much for the
101:16 - feedback all right uh okay so that's
101:20 - gonna be it I need drink some water and
101:22 - do a bunch of stuff so yeah once again
101:24 - thank you all so much for joining me on
101:26 - this random live stream in the middle of
101:27 - the week I hope you've been playing the
101:29 - demo I hope you've been enjoying it uh
101:32 - if not go ahead and make sure you add
101:33 - the game to your wish list give demo a
101:35 - try and let me know what you think let
101:36 - me know your feedback all right so yeah
101:38 - uh thank you all so much for watching
101:40 - and I'll see you next time alright bye
101:42 - everyone thanks

Cleaned transcript:

all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right okay let me make sure everything is working make sure the steam is working all right I forgot one thing uh crap forgot this uh all right just okay I think it's working all right okay great all right okay so I was just missing this window all right okay so hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here at 4 pm in the afternoon or whatever it is your time just minimize everything and okay all right okay right so basically I'm gonna be working on the game trying to make a bit of progress trying to make the next update for the demo and yeah at the same time trying to answer some questions something so let's see wait is this might oh right it's just my my thing wasn't live okay yeah I think everything is good okay great all right what is your OS I'm on Windows pretty much always use Windows I've never actually used the Mac I've only used it like for five minutes trying to make a a iOS build for something yeah yeah pretty much always using Windows okay so basically the main thing that I would like to do is something that it's still not implemented in the demo which is over here the goal so basically I need to add a bunch of logic to track all of the various gongs so clone 30 dinkies build the rocket fully automate The Colony and keep the colony safe so pretty much automating those goals that is kind of thing that I'm going to want to do all right happy birthday okay happy birthday koyan hey that's nice I hope that helps all right okay okay so let me get to this so first thing I'm going to need some kind of goal manager all right let me make an empty game object for the gold manager and uh just wait for it to compile nice pen Springs I pretty much only know one or two tricks by now most of them I've kind of Forgotten with the ears but yeah it's fun to keep the brain occupied or rather keep the hands occupied instead of the thing use the unity only why do you mean yeah I'm using regular Yin Ty I'm not using UI toolkit so that one as far as I know actually I haven't kept up with the updates on that one for quite a while but I think that by now it is still only uh editor only or maybe it already has I'm not sure but yeah I am using just regular Unity so all of these these are all of my UI windows for demo so all of them separated and all these are basically just images buttons all of it super basic when will the new Dodge theorem be available uh I don't know I still have to go research that so hopefully sometime next month that's kind of the it's kind of gone that's what I'm going to try to do okay so uh for the gold manager all right so I'm going to okay so first thing let me actually keep track of the dinky amount uh so update visual actually do I go with the visual maybe not Jiffy is a measurement of time is it all right so fast in writing code I mean that's just spending many many years uh typing things that kind of that kind of has that effect okay uh right so I'm trying to think because I should probably have a visual and one so how am I going to have I guess it's I have like a private end for the denki amount uh gone do I call it go maybe so kind of like this equals 30. um red ball has built rocket well for the uh is Colony for the automated and let's get going for actually I'm trying to Define these but I should probably just yeah first thing I need to actually okay so let me think how am I how am I going to do this finish the signal player kitchen course in one hour you finish it in one hour you watch a 10 hour video in one hour okay I mean that's impressive so all right okay so up here I think I'm going to listen to my time tick system and pretty much on every second I'm going to try to get these things learning your turnbased strategy course 58 done oh it's awesome learn about something ah nice when should I use Singletons there are some rules internet opinions vary uh yeah it depends on for me as a general rule basically if there is something of which there's only one thing then by all means go ahead and make it a sentence so over here on this project I've got tons of Singletons like for example over here the tutorial manager this one handles the tutorial there's only one tutorial manager so it makes perfect sense for this one to be a Singleton then on the other hand for dinkies I've got tons of dinkies so it makes no sense for the dinky itself to be a Singleton uh on the player kind of the same thing so there are multiple players but at the same time there's only one local player so I do have a Singleton reference for the local instance so yeah pretty much for anything that you have just a single one of by all means go ahead and make it a Singleton as long as there's only one exists then that's a perfect thing I know there are lots of people who really hate the Singleton pattern never actually want to use it but for me I find to be super useful if there's anything where just exists just one thing then yep it should definitely be a single thing okay so let me try to think a little about this so basically the first thing is I want to do actually for dinky Mount I can go to dinky because I'm pretty sure yeah I already got a get ink amount so I can just do debug.hog on dinky amount and put in the dinky amount then I guess debug.log in order to test for the house bumpy rocket and for the rocket let's think how am I going to do I think the best thing is kind of how I was handling the uh my save system which I pretty much just did a query a physics query to find all the objects in the world pretty sure that's what I did right um yep that's pretty much it so just doing a basic physics querying so over here don't let me try to do pretty much these same things so uh all right so I'm going to go to the entire world size and so on unlike total Liberation more than 10 yards well I mean the good news is that game is not canceled that one is just post one for next year so yeah definitely stay tuned for next year are you using tune [ __ ] in this project yep I'm using what is called the Quigley asset so if I can just go into the asset store it's a really nice one I've mentioned it a bunch of times there it has been part of a bunch of bundles so yeah this is the one that I'm using it's a really nice Shader with tons and tons of options so over here in the game yeah actually I haven't actually played the game hey super Chad Tracy hunt hey thanks so much thanks for being here I'm glad you liked the videos thank you so much the first Super Chat oh that's cool thanks for using your first super channel on me all right thank you so much uh uh okay what was I saying all right the uh the assets yeah I'm basically using equivalently okay let me pick a bigger one with a bunch more things so my big save with a nice big machine so yeah pretty much I'm using the equivalent Shader to make all of these assets and look quite a bit more cartoony because these are actually the uh scifi worlds pack ah crap yes the SciFi worlds yeah basically this is the pack that I'm using for most of these assets so see that little round thing that is pretty much over here the HQ and you can see how it looks quite different because it's using quite a different uh shaders so if you want to make your assets look quite a bit different I would definitely recommend using an interesting Shader if you apply an interesting shade and everything kind of looks like it fits so it looks pretty good so so yeah and basically the way that I was saying uh yeah I'm using the equivalently Shader asset and I'm using just modifying the color of the outline in order to select Which object is actually selected and that has been quite useful pretty much just go into the materials so I've got a ton of materials using all kinds of things for example over here for the food material so I've got the food texture map and over here I've got a black outline and then I swap out for one that has the white outline and that's pretty much how I'm handling the visuals for the object solution so pretty basic and it works pretty well I think it changes the outline which I think makes everything look quite nice it's super easy to see what object is selected so everything looks pretty good okay all right okay let me just continue with the goals here so for the although actually for the rocket I was thinking about doing this but yeah once again a while ago we were talking about Singletons and for example the rocket is only ever going to have a single rocket so I can actually make this a Singleton so an instance with a get a private set and then down here on the awake all right boy the way just instance equals this since the rocket is only going to have this one so for the gold manager for this one to test if it has a rocket just debug the hog has rocket and I can just go into the rocket base and the instance if it is not known then I do have rocket if not then I don't have a rocket okay so that's the other goal and then fully automate The Colony so no dinky's working and for that I actually also have a dinky get the dinking list so this one returns only so dinky for the banking list so I can get that one and do a four inch uh Dinky Dinky in the dinky list I can cycle through all of those and thank you dot do I have an is item is I don't think we have okay great all right so I already have this function so that actually simplifies things quite a bit so if one of them is not idle so uh hint uh dinky is working then dinky's working plus was if it is not I don't then think he's working so debug.log for for the dinkies working and just put the link is working okay so that's the other gun and for the other one so if only automate The Colony so none of them can be working then keep the colony safe okay this is the one that is going to be a bit tricky your PC configuration uh I have no idea I've got a a 380 and a uh CPU is a 5950x I think it's like three years old but it's still pretty good to use blender in your 3D software I've used it a little bit I've tried learning blender actually made a video because I I followed the course and I did manage to learn quite a bit so if you want to see what I managed to build in about 10 hours and this was a fun video you can actually learn quite a bit even if you're I mean I'm definitely not a blender Pro but I did manage to build some pretty nice things over here let me just go ah crap I can see uh yeah the final the final thing actually looks pretty good I made all these models after following a course for about 10 hours I think something like that so yeah yeah if you're interested in 3D modeling definitely I would recommend you give it a shot because it's not as difficult as it seems pretty much uh right uh okay so oh crap this is messing up my save that's okay keep the it's gonna be there uh okay so I'm gonna have to figure out how do I keep the colony safe and then launch into space okay but for these ones I think the logic for these goals should be working so let me just quickly test it out all right you know asset Forge by Kenny I've never I'm familiar with Kenny's assets but I've never used acid Forge that's his like 3D modeling program something like that which does does seem quite interesting from what I see of his uh gifs posted on Twitter it does seem quite interesting so yeah I've never used it myself but yeah if you want to make some simple things then that can be quite useful okay where's my console uh okay so apparently two dinkies are working is that correct okay this one is working so I put this one on idle uh any more dinkies that are working and there's one over here picking up objects no not this one nope not this one which one that one why is this one picking up objects okay I don't know but set it on I don't okay so I think he's working zero and true for the rocket really do I have a rocket here uh I don't think I want a rocket in this map did I okay that's a bit strange because I don't think I've done the rocket all right did I build the rocket anywhere no or did I put it yeah different from no okay are you planning to add features to the character on like a face or hat or something uh yep the asset pack that I chose for the characters has a a ton of customization options so yep I will definitely be adding those in the future right now the only thing that I have is just just changing the colors but yep in the final version it will indeed have tons of things that you can use to customize a character to make them look quite a bit interesting okay so seriously I alright so now I'm a bit confused did I add it to the wrong thing uh nope I added it over here the rocket base this is some okay I'm not sure why this one is doing this because this one should be known right yeah has Rockets let me just print out this then that how to make my name like yours with the black background the outline these are the members so yeah Timber Jones here is a member of the channel so thank you so much yeah uh uh okay tutorials on planning out code for game uh I'm almost finished with your build defender course and there is so many scripts that link together I wonder how do you plan for that uh as with so many things the answer usually comes down to experience so that's one answer but the other answer is it really depends on a person by person based like some people like to make all kinds of diagrams and really uh really draw a bunch of pictures that say this system connects to this one this one and so on some people like to do that for me I don't really do that all that much I just do it a tiny bit and for the most part yeah I already have enough experience that I know when I think about some kind of system that I want to build I already know how it's going to connect what kind of other systems do I need to interact with those systems something like that okay so that's even more strange did I change something okay so this is one of those things that quite confused me because a while ago it was saying true that I perhaps not save it don't you need to reset the Singleton between the games nope because the Singleton just gets destroyed so as soon as I change scenes the objects that I'm over here because for The Singletons I'm not using these uh static classes these are for example over here they go manager this is an actual regular amount of behavior which is attached to a regular game object on the scene so as soon as I change scene that game object is going to be destroyed so the instance gets cleaned up automatically so nope you don't need to do that the only place where I do need to reset is my yeah I've got a reset static data mono Behavior just a nice class that exists on the main menu to restart to reset a bunch of things and I'm pretty much just using it for example over here I've got a static list so this is not going to be cleared up automatically so for this one I do need to manually clear it up and the most important thing is for all the events so I've got a bunch of static events like for this one when any carry vehicle opens UI or when any gets destroyed static events they don't get destroyed automatically so for this yep I do need to reset them manually but for just Singleton static instances for those you don't really need to worry too much how many games have you made I think it's eight yeah I think this is going to be my ninth game so yeah it has already been quite a lot although that is in the context of uh 2012 so yeah about 10 years 9 games so yeah roughly something like that okay so I'm a bit confused as to why this was I have no idea did I forget to save a while ago I don't know but was because I didn't have the parentheses that it was doing something strange with the okay I'm not entirely sure but anyway so now the logic is working that one does say false because the rocket does not exist because of course does not exist let me just actually try to make a rocket do I have to actually yeah this is the one thing that I really need to change and let me use my debug menu just to automatically complete uh the research so let me do okay take out the that bot just finish the research for the rocket and actually I'm going to need to spawn the rocket button might as well see a the rocket is actually not this one the optimization is in here because it's looking smooth actually no actually right now everything is pretty much uh well I wouldn't say unoptimize I mean I didn't try to make sure that the code was decent but no I did not think uh too much about optimization I haven't done that so yeah but it is working quite decently if I'm working the analysis profiler and uh okay so let's see a random frame so what is it doing okay so a bunch of thing on the render pipeline and a bunch of squirts here I do got a quite a bit of garbage okay look at that the chase mine yeah no it's not the overall apps here but something on the chase mine is taking a bunch of garbage what is it yeah because basically for uh for actually doing optimization I haven't worried too much about it as long as it's playable right now I very much uh won't the game be free you know the final game is going to be a regular paid game but the demo is free so if you want go ahead go on to steam right now and play the free demo foreign so this one is actually generating garbage why is that well first of all if I were to optimize this the first thing I would do would be not to look for a Target on every single update I'm pretty sure I did do uh like for example on the uh gather resources on the dinky behavior for dinkies Gathering resources yep for here over here I use a basic timer just make sure that it doesn't test on every single thing so I'm just doing it overlaps here but only doing it every x amount of time so that is if I were to optimize over here Chase mine that's what I would do instead of looking for Target on every single update I would make it all look at most five times per second that is more than enough so yeah because over here he's constantly doing that the array yeah this one is it's probably over here that it's generating all that garbage so I got a whole bunch of Chase mines so all those are generating the garbage because they're all constantly grabbing a collateral array on every single update so yep I will definitely uh play around this try to fix things but yeah for a for a regular hey your answer hey how's it going uh yeah so for a demo I'm mostly focused on actually implementing things and not oh and Jason Wyman as well hey Jason how's it going nice uh right okay let me just kill the the zombies just make sure that they don't actually wipe out my entire base because I don't have to get a different saving that would be tricky uh all right okay what was I doing uh I need to spawn what do I need to spawn uh all right that's the other thing that I need to work on afterwards right let me just go into the HQ and I wanted to spawn the rocket okay so I guess now I might as well yeah try to get all of these fun watching all the code oh it's awesome are you working on the RPG hey best of luck with that I hope it's going well nice where they use a tick system uh I've got a Time Tech system it's just a super helpful basic class that just triggers the take on every 0.2 seconds so just five times so any logic that I have that I want to do instead of being on every update instead of having to do instead of having to manually handle a timer I can just listen to one of these events and do something on this on tick for example what am I doing like for example over here on the tutorial manager in order to complete this tutorial I'm going for Gather Five Stone instead of checking on every single update to check if that crate container has five Zone instead of that it's really just listening to that only on the time Tech system so on the time tick so pretty much just five times per second instead of doing it on every update it doesn't overlap sphere to find that one and so on so yeah the time take system is super useful in terms of performance and really just not wasting things and actually that is something that I that script the time take system that is actually something that I did in a video a very long time ago so here it is authentic system I made two videos on it this was in 2018 and before that on many of my Steam games I also use this so yeah that's the one great example about writing some good code you can then reuse it on tons of things or intensive things many years in the future so that is super useful all right uh okay so let me just get back to work on Little Bits all right uh okay what was I doing okay let me just try to make a thing so let's see what do I need to get I'm going to need some tier two some microchips some greenium I think I've got some regular greenium okay so I can use this one right here let me just place okay I've got way too many mod way too many objects on this testing scene that actually makes things quite a bit tricky so let me just place a bunch more of these because yeah this definitely yeah that is one thing that I do need to improve for the final game is come up with some things to like encourage the player to spread out the bass a bit more because over here this is way too busy there are way too many things oh look at that did I just encounter a bug Maybe huh was it because the saves okay so I'll have to figure that out what happened to the okay that's interesting so because I had one of these Bots was over here interacting and feeding things into storage but apparently the bot got tired and decided that it didn't want to do so I'm not sure oh because it's all right anyways I'm not sure what happened here maybe an issue of the save so I'll have to look into that okay so again I get distracted way too much so I need to get some tier two ingots some microchips some purple let me use my debug menu to spawn some some purple crystals some tier 2 ingots let me just Place those so not you you place it in there some tier two and just need what else uh greenium purple just the microchips so let me grab some microchips how can I use the line renderer in a network variable uh the answer is you don't use well could you use the Line Runner no I don't think so uh yeah basically the answer is the online render is really just a list of vector threes so you would simply synchronize a networking list of vector 3. so you can just do the same amount of behavior so this is not the one this one is also not abundant Behavior okay so I need one yeah so you can make a private network list of vector three so you can do that for the what you call line renderer Point list so you can pretty much just see this just synchronize that list and then on the online renderer you can actually set those I think I use that then I use that on the uh it was a recent video what oh right the track your path over here I'm pretty sure that I use the online renderer for the for calculating the thing for the pad position list then web online rendering yes I'm pretty sure the online render does work with alist yep there you go you set the position count then you call set positions and so on so basically you would synchronize a list of vector threes and then just call and set positions and you would do it just like that so remember you don't have to synchronize the entire component you can just break down the component into into the components that make up that component and just synchronize that data instead of the components itself so yep that's what I would do yeah so let's say it's really cluttered yeah yeah the computer doesn't even throw yeah that's uh it definitely still needs optimization work but yeah honestly I'm surprised that right now without having to focus too much on optimization everything is looking pretty good so yeah I'm pretty pretty impressed pretty pleased with the current performance of the demo so that's nice all right how many dollars will the game cost I don't know maybe five maybe ten maybe 12 I don't know that is something that I still haven't figured out exactly what it's going to be uh okay so the last thing that I needed was just see microchip so let me just get those uh get those where's the microchips oh Electronics that's it uh where did it spawn there it is it's right here places in there so let me just link those so I'll link that one link that one put that one and that one and craft and there you go it does work is this your biggest game yet uh no no actually I just I just did a a short a while ago so I don't know how many of you watch shorts but actually just did a pretty fun chart which was on the on how many lines of code I wrote in two weeks which was the two weeks leading up to this and the answer was about sixteen thousand which is quite a lot in two weeks that's about a thousand lines of code per day so that's a ton of work a ton of stuff but yeah definitely not my I'm pretty sure that uh Battleground Tycoon my previous game was like I don't know I'm pretty sure it was over a hundred thousand so yeah that one I would say is still quite a bit more more complex so yeah but this one is still only them yeah it's over nine thousand definitely it's uh yeah so but this is just them so who knows by the time the the game is complete Maybe by then this will indeed be my most complex am yet I'm not sure we'll see in Sim sets are correct it says you have 165 followers that means 151600 wishlist uh nope the wish lists are a bit better than that they are currently on 2300 I think or 2400 something like that one of those two so yeah it is going pretty decently I mean my goal is to uh get up to about um at least five thousand by the release date and release date is in about two months maybe so yeah the goal was to be able to get up to five thousand all the time which hopefully should be doable so let's see so far development is going good wish lists are going pretty decent so yep definitely keeping up all right all right which one the rocket cost uh actually cause is something that I still don't know read my comment what comment sorry I'm trying to keep up but yeah I don't see any comment from you make an open world Street Racing hack and slash first person third person with what okay I mean if you're a beginner and you're asking that question I would say definitely limit your scope open world Street Racing hack and slash first second third person ball time I mean technically that is possible uh but yeah as a solo Dev especially if you're not very experienced I would definitely encourage you to limit your your ideas to something a bit more manageable uh okay uh I'm quite a bit distracted I have to say but all right uh okay so that one so I was doing all that just to be able to see if the logic for beyond the rocket it is true and it is indeed working okay someone has X number of things I think how much will the game cost uh like I said so I'm not sure perhaps five dollars perhaps 10 I'm not sure can you show the save system yep the save system is actually super simple I mean it's very verbose because right now I'm I'm storing a ton of stuff but yeah pretty much all this is just copy paste for different types of things so it's really just I got a save object or a list of save objects and then I just initialize those lists and I just do a basic physics overlaps here on the entire world just an easy way to cycle through every single object in the world then I try to get the component of a bunch of things I go into that object and I get a save object out of it so for example over here the carry object these are the vehicles that move back and forth over here this one has a save object so this one just saves uh if this one is carrying anything and it saves the position so pretty much very simple and basically just creates a save object which in turn is converting to Json and then for unloading the spawn back together that once again gets the same save object then just instantiates the object and so on so the save system is actually something that I covered quite a long time ago and it's still exactly the same thing that I use nowadays so saving and loading to a file using Json so this video from 2018 this is still exactly how I do things nowadays so pretty much just create a safe object of something like for example here the dinky the dinky has a save object it's going to store the position the hunger Mount whatever dinky behavior is currently active as well as which house spawned on this linking and pretty much just converts that into a save object which in turn the save system takes all of that converts all of that into Json then saves that into a path so let's open just for fun let's look at a a save object so let me go it's on the other side these saves let me see a big one all right so there you go this is the save object which as you can see it's also not optimized so it's storing a ton of wasteful data but still this is only 36 kilobytes so this is all pretty basic uh yeah this is the save object this is what saves on that so everything that you saw on that game over there it's all in here did you Cipher it nope this is a single player game or a Coop multiplayer game so yeah I don't I don't really care if you go up here and you cheat like for example here is the hunger Mount so some random dinky has 134 hunger I don't really care if you come up here and you say 999 so that it never gets hungry if that's what you want to do by all means go ahead so yeah everything is stored here everything in nice plain text doesn't really matter so yep the safe system is pretty basic so if you want to see definitely go watch that video it's from 2018 but everything everything that I do nowadays don't pretty much exactly the same uh all right so basically what I was doing is I was just figuring out on the goal manager and once again Tracy on thanks so much for the Super Chat thank you uh Sunday gold managers over here so I'm tracking the thing came out I'm tracking the rocket amount uh I'm tracking how many denkis are working so what else do I need I need to keep the colony safe so yeah that is the one that is going to be quite tricky because I gotta figure out how do I Define uh uh was a zombie spawner what did I call it the zombie spawner uh uh I guess I could have like a like a private float last time attack I could have something like this and then up here on this one I could do a set last time attack and then I could do last time attack equals time dot time all right so then I could go on to the zombie and when the zombie attacks something so moving to attack dinky and whenever the U attack a dinky go into Terry dinky and the deal damage so up here I could go into zombie spawner did I Make an instance I did so let's call the uh set last time attack so with that that would okay so yeah I do think like this it would work so that defines the last time attack all right then a public float get time since last attack oh great make a course yeah I've got plenty of courses and I'd love to make another one but I'd love to make another one at the same time I'd love to work on this game so there are so many things that I'd love to do if only I could find the time so yeah okay get the time because time dot time oh this is the beginning of this Frame so this is not what I want uh it's the real time since startup yeah that's what I want uh all right so I get the time since last attack and this I think is going to be in seconds so let me go into the goal manager and let's go into the zombie spawner instance get time since last attack load for the time since last attack and I get that one just see we debug don't log on the time okay all the time since the last attack just get this one okay won't that continue even when paused actually that's a good question because I don't know if time Dot that's actually a very good question because I don't know if this one stops on because I thought there were two of them yeah I thought one was on Dante time and one was not okay so let's figure that out that is actually super simple to figure out so let me just go yeah just over here and let's go on to the time tag so just do a debug the hug on the time real time some syrup and let's see if that one where's my thing real time will continue time will pause yeah but the time was so what kind of times you have real time since syrup yeah but the time oh the time at the beginning of this Frame okay yeah oh it was the unscale time okay that's what I was thinking okay so that's what I was thinking so yeah I do think real time might stop so I do think it should probably be uh okay so over here it's actually not spawning so let me just continue uh let's see that one okay 32 33 34 and I pause right it's not but now if I unpause that code is going to run yeah 38 okay so that one does not get impacted so I cannot use that one but yeah so I think I was I was correct in the beginning so it is time.time so without it should actually say now that one should stop since apparently it's the unscaled time that's the one that I was confusing when all right uh so let's go there continue and let's see okay three seconds four seconds oh actually yeah that is something that I yeah I definitely need to update that on start otherwise it's going to be messed up again anyway okay so pause on 14 wait a few seconds wait a few seconds unpause and now it's in size 15. okay awesome cool all right so that works test message yeah test successful all right okay so that work love your videos Ah that's awesome I'm glad you're watching them why don't you don't like them hey there hey Paul how's it going uh all right so basically I just need to set oh right yeah I was thinking about setting this on the beginning but no I also gotta I also gotta save this hmm all right so I was thinking I mean I can probably put it over here on the awake just to fix things a little bit but right yeah anyway so I do think this does work so okay let me just uh see if the time since the last attack if that one is working which should be working so let's ignore the time.time over there because sometimes I say but the character didn't update uh that part has a manual thing so let me just let me just manually try to see if there's any new characters uh okay right let me try to see that one if there's any characters that one takes a little bit um right all of those are validated there's another one let me validate it anymore uh right there was one that was validated but who was saying that oh boy I've got way too many way too many tabs artem uh uh right uh I do see yours and yours is validated but you need to go into the user account page and you need to link your YouTube account otherwise the overlay over here doesn't know uh which account belongs to you so basically you need to go onto your user page on the website and you need to click over here in order to link your YouTube account then the uh overlay over here won't be able to know which character blocks you and then it will apply the custom thing so yeah just go ahead and do that and it should work game looks amazing oh it's awesome thank you I hope you like it yeah so far things have been quite interesting all right okay so let me see the time since last attack so let me go into single player and uh yeah continue and all right so let's see so that one is going to start from zero okay I'm going to need to save that sure but yeah all right so time since last attack let me spawn a zombie just to see if this is going to work actually I'm probably going to need to spawn multiple zombie or let me just just throw one dinky directly onto the zombie that's a bit sadistic I don't know sorry but yeah just for testing you're gonna be sacrificed okay I'm sorry but yep it did work so it was over there on 26 and as soon as he had he reset the timer okay so that's good so that's basically how I'm going to keep the colony safe so if it goes for I don't know maybe three minutes seven videos for three minutes without a single attack then continues uh then considers that the colony is indeed safe all right okay so with that honestly the guns are pretty much on working I think so let me just make a vision for that so let's see if it works okay so let's make a nice gold visual I'm just going to 2D mode 350 RTX isn't good for Unity uh as always when it comes to Hardware the answer is depends on what kinds of games you want to make if you want to make simple games then pretty much anything is going to work so yeah 30 50 if you're trying to make a giant open world game with super high quality textures then maybe it won't be enough but if you're making a regular game then it probably won't be enough uh for the goals UI why did I is this inside something it isn't inside anything right nope okay so I'm not sure just put them like oh crap uh okay so for all these let me just put them all just like that because I don't want you to scale and let me scale down that goes kind of for okay exactly that's what I want and let me also add my super useful component to reset the position on the UI so this is why I have all my UI Windows all spread over the place visually I can position them and this way I can easily move around and interact with any of these windows and all of them have this component which pretty much just goes and resets the anchor position and the size Delta so pretty much it sets all of these values on zero so as soon as the game starts all of them going to the canvas so just super useful for actually developing the game so I can move things to the side and I can easily play with them alright so on this one on the gonzi Y uh it's going to be a bit tricky how am I going to how am I going to fit such information over here that's the part that's going to be quite tricky uh trying to think uh do I do a text based okay yeah I think the easiest way is we're only just do it text based and then maybe I'll swap for something a bit more visually interesting so for now okay so for now let me just make the basic for the goals UI something like that always a pain when you have one on top the other yep it is and it's because that pain that annoyance that annoyed me for so long that I finally decided okay I need something something better and that's how I come up with this method of move them to the side and during run time put them back where they should so yeah uh all right so over here I'm going to crack my my todoneless over there uh so I'm going to need a serialized film for a private text mesh Pro ugly for the text mesh just something like that uh all right so I'm going to pretty much just right so it's this one right so this one is the the uh title text this one goes text this one just text yet that doesn't matter all right so let's put the goals text did I not how to resize direct transform by dragging the button by dragging the button what button you mean click and drag for that you need to do a bunch of math so I did a uh uh what do I do on the drag and drop yeah basically you need to do yeah drag and drop windows so basically you need to capture the you need to put a button on the corner something that you want to click and then drag so basically you need to listen to a click on that then need to be able to do some math in order to figure out what position how you're going to modify the width and height and so on so look into that video to see how you can click on something and then for the map the math for resizing you can look at the tooltip which just so happens this the only tip that I made in this tutorial in 2020 I'm actually using this in the game so for the various uh totally I'm actually using quite a lot of things that I've covered in a bunch of videos which is it's always fun so yeah if I go into the main menu and if I continue if I go into one of these look at that that tone tip over there that one that automatically scales depending on what text there is Yep this tooltip is exactly the same thing that I covered in this video in 2020 so here I am uh what is it three years later reusing the exact same code in a game so that is really awesome so yeah that is the the power frame good clean code and doing tons of things is that you can then easily reuse them in lots of different places uh all right so let me get my guns over there and okay so I've got the gold text mesh that I'm not going to do it on update but for now let's go text mesh.txt and I need to figure out how am I going to okay so I need a clone then the dinky amount by dinky so I'm going to need to ask the goal manager okay so on this one let's make a goal manager a instance where they get any private sets and up here on price void awake let's set instance equals this okay so then here go manager the instance and I'm going to need to ask so amount and a public end get dinky amount total total you can save on something on canvas instead of making a custom script Staples uh all right so for thank you amount yeah I'm just going to return the denki amount so just return that one total let's return 30 so this is going to be whatever is the funnel goal on the demo then what are the things am I going to need so is rocket build support is rocket built you need to ask this one for all this so is rocket don't it's really just yeah just going to test if that one is not no so just return that one okay the other goal so uh Heavenly uh int get dinky working amount and basically I'm just going to get to the linking list and figure out which ones are working and then I'm going to return this right here so that Returns the dinkies working and is Colony safe so if only if we'll get last uh attack timer return go into the zombie spawner instance get last get time since the last attack okay so I think with that I've got a bunch of these time is time is double because time won't be overflown if you play for several days I don't think anyone's gonna I mean because technically that is true technically that will overflow but what is default Maxim isn't like four billion so how how much are four billion seconds so four billion seconds in days 46 000 days okay am I wrong is not for billing because that seems way too big but yeah either way the maximum float in terms of seconds that is going to be huge so so yeah I don't think time is definitely going to be a necessity but yeah maybe I'll add it just because I mean storing a double or a float doesn't really matter too much uh but yeah their black point at the left bottom of your screen there's a black point not my point all right uh in this two billion 40 is the same boat with floating points yeah yeah it looks accuracy but I mean if it's something oh you're talking about the microphone over here yeah this is the microphone yeah the tiny Point dot yeah uh uh yeah it's more expert it loses Precision but difference between I don't know 0.1 and 0.9 seconds that really does not does not worry too much you need to wait to cancel actions yep there is a way there is a way why no dark mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh all right okay so over here so let me go so clone uh the 30 dinky so I'm going to oh because I'm using that one right uh right so Pierre was that one dot get the dinky amount close get the dinky amount total okay so that is going to be the thing yeah in the end I'm not going to end up doing this in with text but yeah for now text should be fine so let me just see that okay so then then build rockets and then I can go into the goal manager instance so is rocket built if so then I'm going to return done if not then I'm going to return nothing okay and then a new line I need to put this inside a something okay so the next one is the fully automated Colony so if only automate The Colony and then let me go into the goal manager instance get the dinky working amount ah okay so this is going to be tricky zoom out would be nice yep camera controls are definitely uh something that I wouldn't like yeah that is definitely something that I want to implement just didn't get time to do it over here but yep kind of approach would you use for storing multiple game object wrong position Json a good idea from lots of game objects uh yeah sure I mean it all depends on what you're trying to say but over here for my for my dinkies for example all of them they're storing the position so I can have up to like 50 denkis or however and yeah it's not just storing a vector three that stores perfectly fine in a thing a while ago I I showed the uh the uh the save file which has all of those positions so if I go into saves I open up one of these and they're gonna look at that position here is the X here is the Y and here's the set so here's a vector three converted into Json so yep you can definitely store as many of these as you want I mean this looks like a pretty big file and it is a pretty big game quite a bit of that but in reality it's only 30 kilobytes and of course you could obviously optimize this by quite a lot but yeah uh right now 30 count by bites Force I found that is really not something that I'm worried about but yeah uh so yeah if you want to store positions yep Json works perfectly fine for starting quite a lot of them uh okay so over here let me actually uh I'm trying to think of how am I going to do this um do a string fully automate colony something like this it's going to be a bit better because on the dinky amount this one if this one is bigger than zero then what's going to this one and plus equals slash in and say five I think he's working so that should not be like that okay so that is going to be the only automated colony then in your line and finally the last one is just keep Colony safe and then I'm going to go into that one yeah let's do a screen gun so keep keep the colony safe yeah working with strings here not very good but for now just get it working so keep Colony save then let me go into the goal manager the instance and get the what did I call the last attack timer uh I'm trying to think the logic should not be over here on the UI how can you fit all those physics objects we don't like I mean I haven't done anything specific so it's really just uh Unity rigid bodies and the way their physics system works so yeah it could definitely be optimized quite a lot but yeah for now like that should make how to customize buttons you want to like resize or change position on the screen like mobile player have the option to change the button I mean that is mostly just it's really just modifying the the scale of the object so you can access the rec transform you can modify the position the anchor the width so you can modify the size down so that was what I was doing a while ago on this script the reset position script this grow goes into the direct transform and grabs the anchor position and the size Delta so yeah that's pretty much what you would do in terms of logic it's not complex it's just a ton of work you'd have to Define like like for example so you would have like a switch on some kind of private enum for the UI UI size UI size you have small small medium and large you would have something like this and then you do a UI size UI size something like this and you would do a switch on the UI size in case it is UI size dot small okay this you would go into the right transform and set the size Delta to I don't know something like maybe on small you've got 30 by 30 then on something like a medium you would have perhaps 50 by 50 and this one you would have 100 by 100 so that's pretty much what you would do you just Define the sizes then just going to rec transform modified size Delta maybe also modify the anchored position so yeah in terms of logic it is pretty simple it's just quite uh quite verbose right on this code so I would probably make a mono Behavior component something to hold on data so for saying Okay so this component when it's small it should be on this size when it's medium should be on this one this one so on so for that you could actually just make a serialized field of a private Vector 2 for the small size and medium size and so on then you could set this in the editor something like that so yeah so in terms of doing that it's uh pretty simple just takes quite a bit of work here all right uh okay uh right so what I was doing uh I was on the on the girls UI okay get the last type of timer so public boom is Colony safe uh so private operate mode okay maybe a Content I don't know put it here so private mode so Colony save timer so get the colony save timer and let's say the colony is safe after 10 seconds just make it easier to test is Colony saves so return get the last attack timer if it is bigger then is called then the get Colony save timer if so then the colony is safe uh okay so we're here so for the keep the colony safe okay so is Colony safe so if it is safe then let's go into this one and just use equals safe uh if not then I'm going to go into that one and add actually let me add a new line last attack then go into the goal manager instance get the last attack timer and this one is going to need a two string and I always forget the format for the two string is it pound two no I think it's N2 or F2 yeah I think it's F2 or no because that's actually I don't want that yeah now that I'm thinking about it yeah I really just round to end I've got round to end yeah that is going to be enough so let's check on something and then I print so keep Colony safe just print down okay so I think that is going to be the basic text okay and then launch into the space okay let me just add that one so just over here just drop launch into space okay uh all right so I do think the logic should be working all right uh okay so this one should be updating that one the only thing is this one was moving quite a bit wasn't it I think it was okay that's a bit strange the position of the UI because it was maybe four instead of round two tomorrow yeah I I guess uh why is this one showing up in there did I how did I mess up the okay now that's a bit confusing oh never mind because of scale right yeah I modified the scale because it was way too big yeah with skin like that it's going to overlap the control so I'm going to need to modify the controls a little bit yeah why don't you use string formatting with the string interpolation thing uh the answer is simply just because uh by the time that I learned about that one I'm already so used to using just the uh regular plus adding something so yeah the answer is really just just uh being way too used uh just using that for way too long that is really the only answer so if you like that by all means you string interpolation because it is quite a bit easier uh okay so I'm trying to figure ah crap yeah never mind about that ah now I'm clicking everywhere uh all right so that is way too big but I don't care let's just see if it is working okay so let's go back outside let's go in let's continue and let's see all right clone 730 build rocket done fully automate colony and it is apparently fully automated but if I turn one of these to feed some dinkies so let's go do something start the other and there you go one thing key is working okay so the logic is working which is only matters I'm going to obviously need to modify the actual uh logic that's not supposed to be in text but yep that is pretty much it so for the let's just add some colors just for fun uh so red green blue is the color and color and over here for color equals uh let me get an orange so let me figure out some color over here we go into one of these just pick up some kind of like an orange red yeah something like this is a good color okay so let's put down so let's see Conway 40 and less attack color and for dinky's working let me do the same thing so if there are I think he's working you do that and uh if not let me just yeah because I want to put see right because yeah I'm doing that one was equals the done safe done something so fully automate the quality just uh yep just like that so keep the colony safe so keep it safe build the rocket and so on and get the denki amount Stone and build the rocket and done let me just just do that just putting some color just a bit of fun just in case some of you don't know you can use tags in your text which is a nice and easy way to add a little bit of Polish to the text without having to make anything special you can just see include Rich Text tags and everything works and a super Channel thank you Rafael hey thank you have you seen the game captains of industry uh I'm pretty sure I've seen of it but I haven't uh I haven't played it but yeah I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I saw that one in one of my one of my oh look at that there's my is that my stream yeah there it is so it is working that's great uh yeah is that the one with pixels or something yeah I'm pretty sure I saw this one oh it's this one okay yeah I thought it was another one that has a bunch of voxels and things yeah oh yeah this is the one where you can mine everywhere yeah I remember seeing this one when it came out 31 of May 22 Yeah quite a while ago uh they have very interesting terrain mechanics that I can't figure out uh well for that it's really going to depend on what kind of terrain system you're using I do know that unity's ring system has quite a few limitations so yeah only now I noticed that apparently my camera is yeah only now I noticed that the camera over here the green screen isn't all right yeah only now I noticed that but anyways sure fine stone is still a little bit like that uh anyways uh yeah so that is going to very much depend on what kind of terrain system you're using because yeah they dig all of this because yeah digging to rain in real time that is actually something that is quite complex so yeah I would assume they're using something custom rather than the builtin Unity because I'm pretty sure this is the ENT game but yeah yeah for that it even looks like they've got some kind of voxel grid based terrain the way the terrain is adding in and decreasing seems to be voxel based so yeah maybe that's it maybe you make a Vox on less terrain and pretty much just destroy each chunk at a time so yeah that's definitely one yeah look at that all the levels are very much individualized so they're not very much analog they're either got a home or don't have a home that's pretty much it so but yeah that that is pretty much going to depend on what kind of yeah because even the even the buildings seem to be on like a 3D Vauxhall grid so yeah if I had to guess I would say that I would say the terrain and the entire world has some kind of 3D grid which you can either put some dirt or put nothing on it so yep that pretty much seems to be like that so yeah that that's where I would start my research is how to make some voxel uh terrain thing with quite a bit of with some very good performance which actually right now with dots having just hit 1.0 that would be the perfect thing for doing something like this I mean if you've got a large World using dots using a data oriented approach for storing the the terrain being able to cut it down and build it up that would definitely be my Approach so yeah yeah who knows I mean I would love to do some research on on dots and doing a Terrain system kind of like this could be a fun challenge so yeah thanks for the tip that is really interesting yeah yeah that's part of the reason why I don't like to uh keep doing my series on trying to find uh interesting new releases made with unity it's really just to see what can be done with the engine only that a zombie just spawn look at that that one is terrifying because um yeah so basically checking those checking new releases probably great to be able to see what other people have done with the engine ah crap you go okay just punch them all uh all right so yeah that one is working so build the rocket done fully automate keep the colony safe and yeah I guess the only thing is yeah right for the keep the colony safe uh for that one if my game make a hundred they didn't take 30 dollars Unity doesn't take uh Commission on anything so are you asking about steam because yes in that case yes if you make a hundred bucks of gross revenue on Steam then seem does indeed take 30 percent but Yount doesn't take anything so you can make whatever you want and you know oh yeah I mentioned that dots 1.0 has memory leak really well that's tricky that is definitely going to erase any performance benefits yeah that would be quite tricky then C sharp series I mean if you want Advanced my turnbased strategy course I'm really proud of that course I really think it's a great one really goes for more intermediate users so if you're more on the intermittent level I would say definitely look into that one because yeah in terms of C sharp I don't have anything just on C sharp but yeah C sharp coupled with the game that would be my advice the new input system and Odin in your games I do use the new input system although I do it just like I covered in my in my free course which is first I start by just using the input measure which is exactly what I'm using here over here this game which is right now in the alpha demo Sage this one is still just using the input manager then at some point I'm going to refactor into using the new input system so yep I start with the input manager then eventually I I move up and in terms of Odin uh on this game I haven't really had a reason to use it because it doesn't really have way too much that needs I just made a simple editor's work just once but yeah for the most part on this one doesn't really I've got tons of sort of modules so maybe it would be useful to use Odin to make a tune to like make them but even though I've got a ton of script and objects these were all very much made slowly over time so there never was a point when I'm like okay so I need to build like 50 scriptable objects so yeah that didn't really happen so I didn't really have a need for a tool to make that part super easy to add so yeah right now I'm using the input Venture but I won't be using the input system in terms of Odin I don't know maybe if I get to a point where I need a where I need to do a ton of things maybe but yeah all right uh Okay so Yeah so basically just with this it is working just on the keep Colony safe the one thing that I do want to uh check is keep Colony save is meant to be safe automatically it is not meant to be so let me just pause this just so this doesn't save anything um so the thing with this one is that it's meant to be automatic because basically over here I'm testing for the time since the last attack but but I want to make sure that the defense is automatic that's basically what I want to do I want to to encourage the player to make the colony fully selfsustainable including with the fence so the player is not meant to actually attack anything so I need to keep track of hmm okay so let me think uh so I need like a yeah I guess I just need another one so I got the last time attack uh so this is the last zombie time attack and then I've got another one for the last player time attack okay then on this one second last Zoom be time attack okay and then I'm going to have one for the set last for the player time attack so the last player time attack because basically I need oh no that's sectionally tricky because the player can actually attack with quite a bit of things no with the factory pattern I'm familiar with it but I always forget about it so yeah I don't know it off top of my head for creating instances of classical objects seem similar better than the basic Constructor uh yeah I know of the factory pattern but I've never actually used it uh and nowadays I really don't normally use the base Constructor so for script margin like for example like carry object so uh where's the definition so here it is I just make a certain object with a create asset menu so I don't even use any I don't use anything special for creating it so I just go over here into one of these going to create and here are all my scribbling objects so if I want to make a tune carry object I just make one of these if I want to make a new text so this is the research I just did one of these our new crafting recipe and so on so yeah I've never really used the factory pattern I know it's interesting and sometimes useful but yeah stream dying is it dying it's saying excellent connection so apparently it's what is dying is my throat so yeah that's normal and I'm running out of water so yeah okay let me just uh try to see this I'm quite a bit the strike today I have to say doing live streams is fun but it definitely is quite physically demanding and it does take uh does make me quite a bit less productive what network SDK are you using I'm using netcode for game objects so basically the idea why I started making this game was because I was making my free multiplayer course where I use net code for game objects to make a multiplayer game and I really enjoyed it so that is why I decided to make this game I really wanted to make something in multiplayer so yep and so far it has been very good I've been using it and I had a few strange very random issues but for the most part it has been very good very nice yeah complaining unit of course on kitchen chaos hey good luck yeah that's awesome yeah I hope you'll learn a lot yeah that course has been really nice a lot of people have really enjoyed it so yeah I'm glad people are enjoying it pop your head with water yeah that's a I really prefer this bottle as opposed to a twisty thing so that is so much more efficient super easy to open and close real nice okay so the player on last time attack so basically I just need to go and once again thanks so much for the Super Chat I hope my answer helped so look into voxels perhaps with dots and that's basically how I would try it I think that would be pretty good Unity company isn't near you I'm pretty sure Unity does not have offices over here in Portugal so nope I wonder what is the closest one do they have one in Spain I don't think so so I think the closest would probably be their offices in either London or Berlin not sure which one is is closer so yeah and unite is going to be in Amsterdam this year so that's going to be fun yeah I hope they don't be able to attend so that should be that should be interesting uh all right okay so uh now I'm just trying to figure out how do I okay so that's actually on the zombie I'm trying to remember how do I handle the damage it's over here so for taking damage yeah because I got a damage but I don't have oh right it's on the Canon tract so on try interact this is the one that is going to all right because this is one of the first ones okay then cut a stream yeah a random stream let's be Portuguese yep I mean I'm right here born here so yep even though honestly my brain works more in English and does important she is but yeah I do I pretty much only use Portuguese when when in real life so like going to gym talking to someone talking to a friend yeah that's pretty much the only time that I use Portuguese everything else always with English uh okay so on the try to interact I'm just trying to see am I going to do it here or on the other one and I guess this is always going to run on the server so put on the server I don't have that okay so this is a bit tricky hmm okay so that's a bit tricky but actually no because yeah I'm trying to think okay so I interact in order to deal on damage to the zombies but yeah right the only one that ever uses this the dinkies are never going to attack the zombies and the automated Bots those are also not going to attack the zombie so yeah sure so I think in here on the server I've seen I can just go into the zombie spawner the instance and set the last player time attack because this one is only ever going to be called for the thing shout out please you want me to shout I don't think my voice can handle shouting universe or Mainland I'm in Mainland you're in Lisbon so yeah are you planning to finance your game in the long term can happen that the TNT Services costs eat up your income at some point uh not really I mean so far the demo has gone pretty decently I think I've had like 1500 people playing the demo something like that and basically it is still well within the uh three tiers so yeah so far with a bunch of people playing on relay a bunch of people using the lobby and uh I'm still on the on the free tier so I still don't have to pay one cent so I don't think that is going to be an issue the free tiers on the Unity gaming Services tools those three tiers are I would say pregen uh pretty generous so yep that is so yeah basically I'm not too worried about it I'm going to keep using them and I do think they won't work quite well okay so set the last player time attack okay yet time since the last Zoom be attack and then I needed another one for get time since the last player attack so the last player attack and basically on the goals on the goal manager so the last so so in order to Define if the colony is safe I need to see both of them right so get the last zombie attack timer if it is bigger than that one and the get the last player attack timer and this one is going to be pretty much the exact same thing so get the last player attack timer so get time since last player attack so if that one is also under the get Colony save time or not others that one is above if so then that means it has been more than 10 seconds since either a zombie attack or a player attacked the zombie so if I do that then yeah I do think that's Logic for getting the colony safe okay great been enjoying tears of the Kingdom I was until I until like four weeks ago when I started really uh sprinting to get the demo done in time and since then I haven't touched the game yet so yeah now now that the festival is over which should be over right now at 6 PM is it over uh where's my where's my thing store.steampower.com is the festival over okay so apparently the festival is already over so yeah now that the festival is over the Sprint pretty much ends so hopefully for the rest of this week I can get back to uh doing it a bit more calm and look at that the only stream is on there that's one uh yeah oh and by the way I'm not uh removing the demo so if you want to see the updates that I've been seeing I'm going to try to push another update today so yeah if you want to see that uh definitely I'm going to leave the demo up so feel free to download it and go ahead and add it to your wish list because that really does help uh all right so let me just quickly uh test out what I was doing so let's say okay so one two three four five seconds six seven eight nine and ten any up now the colony is safe okay so now let me spawn a zombie so let me spawn a Zoomy and once again let me sacrifice one of these linkies so sorry about that but okay so let's go find the zombie there it is throw them there okay so let's see that one still safe now let's attack in one second okay so now it's going to go like that okay now if I punch him it should actually reset that so if I reset and nope oh no but yes yeah exactly because now it's going above 10 12. so now it's going to say safe okay now it says save and I'll punch him and still says that okay so I just gotta update the timer but yeah pretty much that does work don't have any Minds I need to make some Minds uh okay so yeah if I attack him okay that's good that means that reset the timer which is good so right now I've gotten logic in order to be able to ensure that the colony is some sustaining so if I attack a zombie it becomes unsafe if a zombie attacks a denki it becomes unsafe so that's great that's his own logic that I want uh just need to go there on the uh I'm going to go and see why it's on the keep Colony safe uh unless attack do I pick the smallest or the biggest the smallest right yeah I think it is a small so math F dot Min pick the smallest between the get last zombie attack timer and get the last player attack timer so pick the smallest of those and yep that's time all right so that's the logic working all right I'm out of water so just gonna be a little bit are there classes for dinkies in the game uh you mean like different abilities uh not really although uh they all do different things so I can expect they I can tell them to do all kinds of things so I can tell dinky to follow me which I think is a a pretty fun thing so like for example if I wanted to make a new thing I can go up tell them hey carry some apples and let's go and build a brand new Outpost over on the side so I can tell them to follow me which is pretty fun I can tell them to fit some dinkies add power interact with machines get resource notes grab objects or move some crates so yep they can do quite a lot of things so not really classes they're all just one dinky but they can do all kinds of things and look at that one thank you working because they cannot be following me so let's put this one back into idle any of them now the colony is fully automated okay C sharp string interpolation yeah I know I just never I just never got used to that so I just do close at the points that just feels uh very automatic premium very automatic to me by now yeah does the player take damage from enemies like in factorio uh nope for uh I really wanted to focus more on actually damaging dinky so you don't like have to protect them but I don't know that's when those design questions that really the answer only comes after play testing so who knows maybe didn't I have some Minds over here no no no no no go away all right so yeah it's the combat that obviously still needs quite a bit of work I still need to make uh actual spawn points for where the zombies are going to come from I think that is going to be much better in order to make it okay like for example lets you keep the colony safe so if I make a bunch of let me spawn a few uh let me spawn a bunch of Chase mines and let me also spawn a zombie sorry for example that one says save so if I punch that one it is going to suddenly become unsafe but if I take a mine and if he gets killed either with the mine or with the tower the one should not reset so there it goes boom any up it does now reset all right awesome so the logic does work okay so I just need to figure out play around with the visual as well a little bit but yep multiple courses which one do you recommend most for someone that wants to make type of games you are making uh that really depends on your skill set where you are but I would recommend starting with my free complete course so this one is completely free you can watch it on YouTube it's 10 hours long so if you're a beginner I would say start with that one and if you're more of an advanced user I would recommend the turn based strategy course this one goes on making quite a bit more complex game so it covers lots of more advanced things so it's a game kind of like XCOM so you start you play in a grid you do all kinds of things you've got all kinds of actions you've got enemies grenades things ragdolls it's a prefun game definitely involves quite a lot more complexity so if you're a more advanced user maybe look into this course but if you're a beginner then just start with my free course just that one will teach you quite a lot okay what time are we doing Emoji rates the rest of my text doesn't you mean over here on my overlay because yeah the uh the thing over here text mesh Pro this one probably does not recognize emojis so yeah which one of your workout monkey oh that's awesome start my own gaming company and build games that is cool nice let's see you have a webcam now yeah always imagining this little monkey talking super fast yep I am human I am indeed human all right thanks for being here thanks for watching the video so I'm glad I'm glad they've been useful to you uh okay so let me just figure out just the visuals in that and actually the rocket that one is not done only now I realize how to make the dark outlines and all the objects that is I'm using the equivali anime shaders and tools so if you want this is the exact asset that I'm using in the game in order to make it look quite interesting and this asset also has a bunch of outlines yeah went through your turnbased strategy course it was a huge help on the card game based off the grid system oh nice a lot of ideas and Implement oh that's awesome hey congrats on completing the course and using it to make something original yeah congrats that it's really awesome nice and she get me and my entire friend group into game development ah that is awesome that is really cool I love seeing those kinds of comments yeah that's awesome what the video sound uh all right okay so let me just let me just visually work on that and yeah then it's probably gonna be it because my voice only quite a bit messed up it's already past 6 p.m so I still got to clean up a bunch of things so yeah uh okay so let me just let me go figure that out and just play with the visual little bits let me go into the goal and see why so I gotta scale it down by a little bit yeah this is actually going to be quite tricky yeah because I was making it 70 by 70. uh well actually for the because can I move the next I got the controls over here but the controls can definitely move a little bit okay so I think I just moved the controls a little bit just over here if it's on 20 is this still readable yeah it's still readable all right so yeah let's put just on 18 okay right now obviously I'm going to come up with a proper thing but for now okay so for now put it to the 18 let me just well let me first just copy the controls UI so copy this component stop playing let me go into the control c y let me paste this component values and for the other one for the goals UI for the guns text let's put it whether I put 18 something like that put check marks in front yeah that's that's good I do think text mesh Pro does support some emojis but I don't know how many so yeah we'll see but um you know let me just make it just a little bit smaller on that one and yeah okay but actually I still need to figure out how am I going to because that one says don't rock it but that is actually not true yeah the rocket is still one part that is not fully built because I still I made all the logic but I haven't yet handled all the costs of the all the various things uh but the stage yeah that's it he goes I do think that it already works but uh okay so let's go here's the public boom is rocket only built just return if the stage equals the the Nikon stage what the record I called it Sage try not save the stage stage dot done try not oh right because I put it stage it's a network variable ah crap let's go down uh the stage dot value if that one is done so the rocket is fully built so on the goal manager so is rocket build down if that one is not known and rocket go in the rocket base rocketbase dot instance that is the rocket form we don't if so it is fully Bond if not then I need to build it okay all right so yeah that should be working except yeah the rocket Stone does not have any cost so I still need to add the one UI and so on horizontal grid layout to Auto size for your UI uh yeah I am using those in quite a few places but yeah uh right now for the UI I'm really just looking for the most basic thing possible right now polishing DUI isn't really something that I'm worried too much about I'm just first of all focus on getting everything working and then I'll focus on actually polishing things okay so build rocket now that one does not say that it's done because it's not done and I need to once again the UI this needs to be updated because right now it doesn't say what are the costs for the rocket so I'm going to need to play around with that by quite a lot so let me pick up some of these create containers and just put a bunch of them okay so let's just see if this works it should be working for single player same time for multiplayer yep everything here is working both in single player and multiplier yeah thanks to using netcode for game objects this is actually surprisingly easy I mean you just make something work you just create a local instance and it automatically works just in single player okay none of them have green crystals let me grab some green cursors there's a ton of them over here so let's go I think this one has five things none of them have some food so let's put some food all right so I need to show these costs but yeah oh I put a progress bar I forgot about that that's good okay yeah so I think this one is let me actually just inspect the rocket the rocket based loan let me put this on debug View so on the rocket base here are the costs so then just yeah I put just one gem green so right now it's on oh interesting the stage that one stores as an INT instead of the text so that's fun that is interesting uh so yeah it is on internal value 2 which means that it can still go one more so I think this is the enlistment so zero one two three yeah I think that one so as soon as I finish that one the build rocket that one should say done did I do that I think I did that and nope so we got one more okay stage three so if I go to the end this one it should go into stage four which is done and that one should be done and there you go done all right awesome so internal value done okay so actually just named it easily that because that one says the done and done so yeah I named zero one two three all right yep okay so yeah that logic works all right so I do need to somehow show the cost I need to do some design work in order to come up with some proper cause for all these so that is going to be question that I need to do and show those cards to the players so they know what to build and with that then I just need to clone the rest of dinkies once those are done then all the goals will be done then just interact this in order to go outside yep sometimes get lost between all the lines and codes in your scripts uh sometimes but over here in Visual Studio something really useful is a shortcut control and comma and over here you can search for all kinds of things for example I don't remember when is uh when am I spawning some zombies so just search for Zoomy and then look and over again I see okay I've got a zombie class then I've got some zombie events and I've got a zombie spawners and be Visual and so on I can then search for dinky and see all the references where I'm referencing denki so tons of things tons of events dinky Network managers on lots of things so yeah so this search bar over here if you ever forget something that is really really useful so that's control comma if you're on Visual Studio it is super useful okay I'm out of water and my mouth is messed up so okay so I think that's gonna be it so I did a little bit of work not as much as I would like but still it was all right so I just gotta finish this up in order to make another in order to make another update and then that should be interesting but yep at least right now logic done done so getting all those goals that did indeed work so this was indeed correct so the time take that did work correctly okay all right so that's gonna be it that was fun that was interesting I need to drink some more and so on okay so let me just enable the background and just do that all right uh it's your birthday it's in May and can we see doggo I mean they're both asleep so nope sorry that doesn't work uh all right I wish you would get some feedback as to your game yep I definitely I definitely want to but yes still haven't had the time there are so many things that I'm trying to do so yeah so for now if you've got some feedback you can just post on these theme forums or in my YouTube comments and I'll make sure to see it and thank you so much for the feedback all right uh okay so that's gonna be it I need drink some water and do a bunch of stuff so yeah once again thank you all so much for joining me on this random live stream in the middle of the week I hope you've been playing the demo I hope you've been enjoying it uh if not go ahead and make sure you add the game to your wish list give demo a try and let me know what you think let me know your feedback all right so yeah uh thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you next time alright bye everyone thanks
