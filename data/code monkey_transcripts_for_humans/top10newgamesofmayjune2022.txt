00:08 - that i didn't do one of these videos

00:27 - insane impressive games than usual since
00:29 - i had to pick 10 from 2 months the main
00:31 - reason why i make these videos is to

00:50 - assets i've covered a bunch of them in
00:52 - my list videos they have a great style

01:21 - packs you can try out so check out their
01:24 - publisher page with the link in the
01:25 - description alright so starting off with
01:27 - one of the bigger hits that launched in
01:28 - may here we have v-rising it's a vampire
01:31 - survival crafting game great mix of
01:33 - mechanics definitely my kind of game and
01:35 - the game really takes the vampire theme
01:37 - seriously it's not just a visual there
01:39 - are mechanics like for example sunlight
01:41 - if you stay out during daytime you're
01:43 - going to get burned another one is if
01:45 - you're carrying silver or you get near
01:47 - garlic it won't burn you
01:49 - and of course you can feed on all kinds
01:51 - of creatures and humans who drink their
01:52 - blood so the game really takes the
01:54 - vampire theme seriously which makes it
01:56 - pretty interesting and unique
01:57 - then on top of that theme it really is a
01:59 - solid survival combat crafting game so
02:02 - you go out you find some enemies using
02:03 - tons of weapons and skills you gather
02:05 - materials chop down some woods and mine
02:08 - some rocks then go back to an area
02:10 - define it as your base and start
02:11 - building some floors and some walls
02:13 - the building system is actually very
02:15 - similar to what i covered in my house
02:17 - building system video so if you want to
02:18 - learn how that can be made go watch that
02:20 - video
02:21 - i had heard great things about this game
02:23 - so now that the course is done and i can
02:25 - finally play some games again i went to
02:26 - play this one first and i'm really
02:28 - enjoying it and the game like i said
02:30 - also has some interesting systems so
02:32 - definitely look forward to one of my how
02:34 - it's made videos on this game recreating
02:36 - some of those interesting mechanics
02:38 - next up for one of the launches of june
02:40 - here is starship troopers terran command
02:43 - this game is the example of using the
02:44 - perfect genre that perfectly matches
02:46 - your source material
02:48 - the starship troopers movie is really
02:50 - awesome and when i saw it as a kid i
02:52 - definitely imagined it as an awesome rts
02:54 - game
02:54 - so that is exactly the kind of game that
02:56 - we have here
02:57 - you can fight hordes of bugs you can
02:59 - command your units and do your part to
03:01 - ensure the survival is civilization
03:03 - you're always outnumbered so winning
03:05 - really requires thinking and deploying
03:06 - your units carefully at the right
03:08 - locations
03:09 - the game also features a true line of
03:11 - sight mechanics so you have to be
03:12 - careful with ambushes
03:14 - there's lots of troops at your disposal
03:16 - everything from some basic infantry to
03:18 - some heavy artillery it's already got
03:20 - over 3000 very positive reviews so this
03:22 - looks like an excellent new rts always
03:25 - remember the only good bug is a dead bug
03:28 - another great game that came out in may
03:29 - is songs of conquest this one really
03:32 - made a splash when it was originally
03:33 - announced i think it was during the game
03:35 - awards
03:36 - the visual look is so unique and so
03:38 - gorgeous that everyone immediately
03:40 - noticed it's a game in a 3d world but
03:42 - with a 2d pixel art style
03:44 - the game itself is a turn-based strategy
03:47 - adventure game with some tactical combat
03:49 - and kingdom management
03:50 - it is inspired by the 90s classics like
03:53 - heroes of might and magic i really
03:54 - enjoyed playing that many years ago
03:56 - there is a massive world for you to
03:58 - explore and conquer you can build your
03:59 - empire construct some towns and wage war
04:02 - against your enemies
04:03 - there's also a really nice barred
04:05 - mechanic where each campaign features a
04:06 - unique song that tells the tale of your
04:08 - rise to glory
04:10 - it's out now in early access with
04:11 - already over 2 000 very positive reviews
04:14 - next up for something with a bit more
04:16 - color here is neon white
04:18 - this was definitely one of the standouts
04:19 - of this latest c3 it is both visually
04:22 - and mechanically unique
04:24 - it's a speed running fps with card
04:26 - mechanics that's definitely a very
04:27 - unique combo
04:28 - you have cards for actions like dash
04:30 - shoot slash
04:32 - then you combine them all to take out
04:34 - the enemies and reach the finish line
04:36 - and the game really just oozes style the
04:38 - visuals are super polished and all the
04:40 - characters are really unique it has a
04:42 - near perfect score with 98 positive out
04:45 - of 3 000 reviews it really is great to
04:47 - see a very unique very imaginative game
04:49 - find such great success
04:51 - then in may there was an interesting
04:53 - game release called line war this one is
04:55 - the work of youtuber infanzia he has a
04:58 - channel with some excellent blender and
04:59 - low poly tutorials
05:01 - personally has someone with very little
05:02 - 3d modelling skills it's just amazing to
05:04 - watch him work i really love the low
05:06 - pawn look
05:07 - this one is his first commercial release
05:09 - and so far it's doing really well the
05:11 - game is a mix of rts with some elements
05:13 - from 4x definitely an interesting design
05:16 - one unique mechanic is how you can draw
05:18 - your orders instead of just right
05:19 - clicking on the target position
05:21 - there's tons of units on screen at any
05:23 - time massive maps you have to handle the
05:25 - combat but also the resource gathering
05:27 - and production
05:28 - and the thing that sets it apart is that
05:30 - 4x mix so the game is primarily about
05:32 - the strategy rather than the
05:33 - moment-to-moment battles so there's no
05:36 - need for ultra-fast micromanagement of
05:38 - units with all that the game seems
05:39 - really great and the reviews are mainly
05:41 - positive however the one big downside is
05:43 - that right now it's multiplayer only
05:46 - for me that's pretty much a deal breaker
05:47 - but the game looks really interesting so
05:49 - i really hope they had a single player
05:51 - mode in the future next up here is a
05:53 - huge release that just came out of early
05:54 - access raft this one was in early access
05:57 - since 2018 tons and tons of updates over
06:00 - time it's always great when a game of
06:02 - this skill gets a full release basically
06:04 - if you enjoy it then you have a massive
06:06 - amount of content for you to enjoy it's
06:08 - a survival crafting exploration game the
06:10 - unique theme is how it's all based on a
06:12 - massive ocean with some islands in
06:13 - between so it kind of looks like cast
06:15 - away the game
06:17 - you gather some resources build up your
06:18 - floating base explore nearby areas and
06:21 - stay away from sharks all of it can be
06:23 - done either solo or online with friends
06:26 - it looks really interesting and already
06:27 - has over 150 very positive reviews so
06:30 - this one has certainly sold millions of
06:32 - copies and if you've been wanting to try
06:34 - it out then maybe now is the time and up
06:36 - next if you're like me and you like
06:38 - managing and building things then here
06:39 - is captain of industry this one was
06:41 - almost my personal pick of the month
06:43 - it's a colony and factory simulation
06:45 - game it's all about industry so you're
06:48 - not building cities for people to live
06:49 - like simcity but rather you're building
06:51 - huge factories processing goods
06:53 - gathering power setting up mines and so
06:55 - on
06:56 - there are complex production chains and
06:58 - lots of conveyor belts for you to place
07:00 - and i really like the trailer for this
07:02 - game the voice over really sells you on
07:04 - the story and the whole journey of the
07:05 - game you start small start simple then
07:08 - you build and build until you get
07:10 - everything needed to build a huge rocket
07:11 - and get into space it's currently in
07:13 - early access and had a pretty huge
07:15 - launch already over a thousand very
07:17 - positive reviews
07:18 - then for a really unique game launch in
07:20 - june here we have card shark
07:23 - it's really an adventure game rather
07:24 - than a card game the whole thing is all
07:26 - about cheating at cards
07:28 - but the goal is to do that without being
07:30 - caught or you might have to survive some
07:32 - kind of pistol duel these are very
07:34 - interesting mechanics and all of which
07:35 - are based on real card tricks so maybe
07:37 - you can learn some tricks for the next
07:39 - time you play some cards with friends it
07:41 - also has a very gorgeous very unique
07:42 - visual style and the dev team
07:45 - participated in one of unity's live
07:46 - streams showcasing how the game works so
07:48 - check it out with the unity twitch
07:50 - channel if you want to see that next up
07:52 - if you're looking to build things and
07:53 - just chill out in your home here is my
07:55 - time at sandrock this one is a sequel to
07:58 - my time at portia and it's very much in
08:00 - the same vein in terms of mechanics you
08:02 - accept the job offer to become
08:04 - sandrock's newest builder you arrive at
08:06 - this empty town out in the world and
08:07 - it's up to you and your trusty tools to
08:09 - restore the community to its former
08:11 - glory gather some resources build some
08:13 - machines interact with the locals defend
08:15 - the town and make a nice profit
08:17 - there is a vast open world for you to
08:19 - explore with lots of combat moves to
08:21 - learn lots of quests to experience and
08:22 - many games to complete so basically if
08:24 - you've enjoyed the original my time with
08:26 - party you'll certainly enjoy this one
08:28 - and finally at number one for my
08:30 - personal pick of the month this one
08:31 - actually came out in may it's hard space
08:33 - ship breaker it was in early access for
08:35 - quite some time and finally had its full
08:37 - release i've been interested in this one
08:39 - since i first saw it the game is all
08:41 - about salvaging and repairing ships
08:43 - you're floating around in space with six
08:45 - degrees of freedom you're working for a
08:47 - company and you get some contracts or
08:49 - missions to inspect and repair a certain
08:50 - ship it features some really interesting
08:52 - tools you first scan the ship you can
08:54 - weld some parts and slice some others
08:57 - but the ships also have lots of hazards
08:59 - one wrong cut and the whole thing blows
09:01 - up so you need to really carefully
09:03 - inspect the ship
09:04 - pay attention to the internals and
09:06 - salvage as much as you can without dying
09:08 - a fiery death it's a really compelling
09:10 - mix of mechanics that i very much want
09:11 - to play and visually this game is
09:13 - gorgeous it's using unity agrp with a
09:16 - realistic art sound that looks really
09:17 - good along with some excellent
09:19 - destruction and some great g physics it
09:22 - already has over 12 000 very positive
09:24 - reviews so if you like the concept
09:26 - definitely give it a try
09:27 - alright so that's 10 awesome new games
09:29 - made with unity and launch in may and
09:31 - june 22. i hope this list helped you see
09:33 - how the unity engine is capable of
09:35 - building anything really the only limits
09:37 - are just your own skills and your own
09:38 - imagination
09:39 - let me know in the comments if you've
