00:03 - games made with un launch in September
00:05 - 23 this month has quite a lot of games
00:07 - with some very unique mechanics and
00:08 - twists it's always really impressive to
00:10 - see just how creative some developers
00:12 - can be I've been covering new games on
00:13 - this list for over two years now and
00:15 - there're still games every month that
00:16 - are surprisingly unique the reason why I
00:18 - make these videos is to show you
00:19 - everything the engine can do the only
00:21 - limit is really just your own skills and
00:22 - Imagination and the variety and the
00:24 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:25 - really puts that to the test all of
00:27 - these games are inal impressive so the
00:28 - list is in no particular order except
00:30 - for the number one game that is my
00:31 - personal pick of the month and of course
00:32 - let me start off my mentioning my own
00:34 - game which is now out it's a fun game
00:36 - with some automation Colony building and
00:38 - defense mechanics where you build a
00:39 - colony automate it and keep the tiny
00:41 - defenseless dinkies safe from harm you
00:43 - then colonize other planets gather more
00:45 - resources with the ultimate goal of
00:46 - colonizing every single planet and
00:48 - automating everything so your dinkies
00:50 - can just relax it's out now on seam I
00:52 - hope you like it and please make sure to
00:53 - try review with your thoughts all right
00:55 - so starting off at number 10 with a fun
00:57 - cozy farming Sim with a nice unique
00:59 - twist it's called paleo Pines the twist
01:01 - in this one is that it has dinosaurs if
01:03 - you're just looking for a fun cozy time
01:05 - then this is exactly what you want the
01:07 - dinosaurs are not just a visual addition
01:09 - though they have some proper gameplay
01:10 - mechanics the dinosaurs essentially act
01:12 - like kind of your tools you can ride
01:14 - them to travel faster or you can use
01:16 - them to help you do all kinds of tasks
01:18 - like for example gather resources there
01:20 - are all kinds of dinos both big and
01:22 - small you can jump on your D and explore
01:24 - this world find some unique structures
01:26 - encounter new plants and of course find
01:28 - and tame new dinos build your farm get
01:30 - some food and relax in this very
01:32 - wondrous world it is out now with 300
01:34 - very positive reviews next if you enjoy
01:36 - tons of Loot and tons of weapons then
01:38 - check out God of weapons it's an action
01:40 - Rog likee where you climb a tower with
01:41 - some vampire survivors like gameplay one
01:44 - really really cool twist is the
01:46 - inventory system it's a really nice
01:48 - mechanic where you have to do some
01:49 - inventory Tetris to fit all of your
01:51 - weapons all the upgrades that you get
01:53 - all of those Come As Weapons which you
01:54 - must somehow place in the inventory The
01:56 - Twist is really how the inventory
01:58 - expands in strange ways face it's not
02:00 - always just a nice neat little rectangle
02:03 - it has some weird shapes along with
02:04 - weird shapes for the weapon which really
02:06 - makes for a really nice puzzle element
02:08 - to try to fit all the upgrades all the
02:10 - weapons honestly I think this is really
02:11 - an ingenious idea and I think it's
02:13 - probably the most fresh new take I've
02:14 - seen on this vampire survivors gameplay
02:16 - if you have a similar idea you'd like to
02:18 - build you can go look at my inventory
02:20 - Tetris tutorial to get you started this
02:22 - game definitely proves how if you take
02:23 - one very popular genre and you twist it
02:25 - in just the right way you can make
02:27 - something awesome and find some great
02:28 - success this one is is out now and
02:30 - already has over a thousand very
02:32 - positive reviews then here's one that is
02:33 - getting pretty much Universal praise
02:35 - it's called cocoon it's from the elite
02:37 - designer of limbo and inside and it
02:40 - certainly does have that kind of charm
02:42 - albeit a bit more colorful it's an
02:44 - adventure puzzle game so you explore
02:46 - this very strange but very gorgeous
02:48 - world everything is very alien like you
02:51 - play some kind of bug-like creature with
02:53 - some wings all the bosses they're all
02:55 - very unique and of course with lots of
02:56 - nice puzzle elements you can interact
02:58 - with the alien machines and then there
03:00 - are even some ORS that have some strange
03:02 - unique abilities which you can then use
03:04 - to solve puzzles and uncover hidden
03:06 - Pathways honestly this definitely isn't
03:07 - the kind of Sher that I'm usually
03:09 - interested in but given just how
03:11 - enthusiastic all of the reviews are that
03:13 - really makes me want to check it out
03:14 - just to see what makes it so good it
03:16 - already has over a thousand
03:17 - overwhelmingly positive reviews at 97%
03:20 - positive so that's an insane amount next
03:22 - here's one that I'm sure that I've
03:23 - covered in a previous video on this
03:25 - series it's called beneath aressa I'm
03:27 - pretty sure that I covered this one back
03:28 - when it went into Early Access and I'm
03:30 - pretty sure that I remember that at the
03:32 - time I thought it looked absolutely
03:33 - excellent and very visually unique but
03:35 - from what I remember it also didn't do
03:37 - very well during that early access it
03:38 - only had a handful of reviews thankfully
03:41 - it seems like it had a successful Early
03:42 - Access and is now doing much better the
03:44 - game itself is a fighting Rog likee deck
03:46 - builder you choose your deck with
03:48 - various attacks and various abilities
03:50 - the game is very much character based
03:52 - every run gives you some exp which you
03:54 - can then use to unlock new unique Heroes
03:56 - you pick just one hero one companion and
03:58 - your deck look at description it looks
04:00 - like they added a ton of depth during
04:02 - early access it has many unique
04:04 - battlefields tons of cards and tons of
04:06 - upgrades you've got several Heroes and
04:08 - companions lots of enemies and some
04:10 - daily missions and just like I thought
04:11 - back when I saw it for the first time I
04:13 - really love how this one looks it looks
04:14 - really stylish it is now fully released
04:16 - with 600 mostly positive reviews next
04:18 - for something a bit more simple and just
04:20 - really very well made here is void crew
04:23 - it's a coop Focus space game where you
04:25 - control your ship you fly to various
04:27 - planets engage in space combat and
04:28 - gather some loot they mentioned Co-op a
04:30 - lot so this really is hyper focused on
04:32 - that there's also a focus on
04:33 - customization both of yourself as a
04:35 - player as well as a ship you can man the
04:37 - turrets Define who does what tasks and
04:40 - you can engage in massive skirmishes
04:42 - with all kinds of enemies and you defeat
04:44 - them using various weapon systems
04:45 - hopefully you win the battles and then
04:47 - you can look for them for lots of
04:48 - goodies and lots of great loot it just
04:50 - launched into Early Access and already
04:52 - has a thousand very positive views and
04:54 - on top of that they also have a very
04:56 - robust road map so if you and your
04:58 - friends are looking for something to
04:59 - play regularly as you follow development
05:01 - then maybe give this one a shot next
05:02 - here's another very unique one called
05:04 - australa six-sided oracles it's a dice
05:07 - base deck building Rog likee so inside
05:09 - of cards you have some dice and a unique
05:11 - dual damage system one damage type lets
05:13 - you for example heal yourself or deal
05:15 - damage to enemies and the other one
05:17 - let's use some corruption which you can
05:19 - use to either damage yourself or damage
05:21 - some enemies some di can then use that
05:23 - corruption for massive effects so that
05:25 - leads to a really nice risk reward type
05:27 - gameplay you decide which dice go in
05:29 - your deck and you can play with the
05:30 - number on each of the dice looking at
05:32 - the trailer it looks quite complex with
05:34 - tons of abilities including several dice
05:36 - which can then be modified with extra
05:38 - dice so basically if you like games with
05:40 - complex Ru sets then this is definitely
05:42 - for you it is another one that is having
05:44 - an excellent reception over 1,400
05:46 - overwhelmingly positive reviews at 95%
05:49 - positive then here's one with a very
05:50 - strange mix of genres it's called etern
05:53 - nights that strange mix is how this one
05:55 - is an action dating C basically it's the
05:57 - apocalypse and you go out on dates and
05:59 - find demons and some weird creatures
06:01 - when you're not exploring dungeons you
06:03 - can then meet a cast of five interesting
06:05 - characters you can learn about them and
06:07 - learn about this world as you go on
06:08 - dates and learn more about each
06:10 - character you unlock unique skills and
06:11 - spells which you can then use in battle
06:13 - every day has an interesting time limit
06:15 - so the question is will you spend more
06:17 - time getting to know your companions or
06:19 - going out into a dungeon to get some
06:20 - loot whatever you choose the clock is
06:22 - ticking it features some really great
06:24 - voice acting and some excellent 2D anime
06:26 - cut scenes it's certainly a very unique
06:28 - mix and one that lot of people seem to
06:30 - be enjoying it is out now with already
06:31 - over a thousand very positive reviews
06:33 - next for some VR here we have Hill
06:35 - sweeper VR basically it looks like Doom
06:38 - VR so first person super intense fastped
06:40 - combat in hell it looks to have some
06:42 - excellent movement mechanics you've got
06:44 - a nice grappling hook there's some nice
06:46 - hair dashes you can slice enemies with a
06:48 - blade or shoot them with a pistol it
06:50 - also has a cute demon wolf companion and
06:52 - the trailer also shows the player ping
06:54 - duol so that's a positive for me there's
06:56 - also something like a front flip
06:57 - movement I have no idea how this
06:59 - actually works but it definitely looks
07:00 - not for people like me who have a
07:02 - relatively weak stomach in VR in general
07:04 - it is certainly very inspired by Doom
07:06 - but it's not really just a basic loan it
07:08 - looks like a properly made game it has
07:10 - lots of unique weapons and some very
07:11 - creative enemies basically if you can
07:13 - handle this much movement in VR then
07:15 - give it a try it is out now with 100
07:17 - mostly positive reviews then if you want
07:19 - even more card games here's another one
07:21 - called railroads and catacombs it has a
07:23 - visual style and gameplay very
07:25 - reminiscent of darkest dungeon you build
07:27 - your train you expand it and upgrade
07:29 - ated this is really the only safe space
07:31 - in the world then prepare your squad
07:33 - assemble the team that you want to take
07:34 - with you and you go out and explore the
07:36 - catacombs but remember not everyone
07:38 - might come back there are over a 100
07:40 - card upgrades find the best combination
07:43 - so you can survive positioning is key
07:45 - get up close and personal or keep your
07:47 - distance they've got a long-term road
07:49 - map so if you're the kind of person who
07:50 - likes to follow along games as they are
07:52 - developed and maybe give the one shot it
07:54 - is out now in Early Access with 200
07:56 - mostly positive reviews and finally at
07:58 - number one for something oozing with
07:59 - style here is El Paso elsewhere the very
08:02 - first second that I heard about this
08:03 - game I was immediately hooked all I
08:05 - heard was this is inspired by Max Bane
08:07 - and yep I'm in I absolutely adore Max
08:09 - ban for some reason that Bol time
08:11 - mechanic never gets old I find it just
08:13 - as cool today as it was when I first
08:14 - played it as a kid and of course the
08:16 - style itself the excellent narration the
08:18 - Noir style it's really such a shame
08:20 - there aren't many more games like it but
08:22 - here we have El Pas elsewhere which is
08:24 - definitely very inspired by Max pain and
08:26 - seems to be excellently wellmade it's
08:27 - got some more outer worldly elments so
08:30 - there's a bunch of vampires and you have
08:31 - to use stakes and bullets to kill them
08:33 - as you kill them you gain more and more
08:35 - bullet time which you can use to make
08:36 - some super cool slow mo leaps and shoot
08:39 - some vampires it's got a very dark and
08:41 - very moody atmosphere visually it has a
08:43 - really nice combo of extremely low poly
08:45 - and very low rest textures coupled with
08:48 - some excellent post-processing and
08:49 - excellent Vol metric fog and lighting it
08:51 - really does look visually very excellent
08:53 - and on top of that the voice acting is
08:55 - just perfect just that perfect Noir Bas
08:57 - depressing tone normally my reference
08:59 - for games is primarily based on
09:01 - mechanics and not really visuals or
09:02 - style but this one is definitely the
09:03 - exception I definitely want to give this
09:05 - one a shot just for the excellent style
09:07 - it is out now with 300 reviews at 95%
09:10 - positive all right so that's 10 awesome
09:12 - new games made with Y launch in
09:13 - September 23 I hope this list helps you
09:15 - see how the unity engine is capable of
09:17 - building anything the onlys are really
09:18 - just your own skills and Imagination
09:20 - check out my own game dinky Guardians
09:21 - and I hope you enjoy playing it

surprisingly unique the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all of these games are inal impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month and of course let me start off my mentioning my own game which is now out it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you build a colony automate it and keep the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from harm you then colonize other planets gather more resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every single planet and automating everything so your dinkies can just relax it's out now on seam I hope you like it and please make sure to try review with your thoughts all right so starting off at number 10 with a fun cozy farming Sim with a nice unique twist it's

an action Rog likee where you climb a tower with some vampire survivors like gameplay one really really cool twist is the inventory system it's a really nice mechanic where you have to do some

strange ways face it's not always just a nice neat little rectangle it has some weird shapes along with weird shapes for the weapon which really makes for a really nice puzzle element to try to fit all the upgrades all the weapons honestly I think this is really an ingenious idea and I think it's probably the most fresh new take I've seen on this vampire survivors gameplay if you have a similar
