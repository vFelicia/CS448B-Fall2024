01:10 - so if you don't want to bother with

01:37 - overlay swap the inlet blur noise and
01:39 - tons more
01:41 - works both in the editor as well as
01:42 - during runtime so this looks like a
01:45 - useful tool if you want to handle all
01:46 - these customizations on the texture
01:48 - itself rather than through a shader
01:49 - really interesting
01:51 - then if you want a complete game kit
01:53 - here is an action adventure game
01:55 - so if you've been playing ellen ring and

02:11 - and armor do some dodge rolls and manage
02:13 - stamina also features of course leveling
02:15 - up and some awesome boss fights so if
02:17 - this is the kind of game that you like
02:19 - to make then perhaps this kit can be
02:20 - useful in order to inspect it and see
02:22 - how it all works
02:24 - if your game has a nature theme then
02:26 - this procedural fine tune looks great
02:28 - it's all procedural so it can be applied
02:30 - to any surface of any mesh
02:33 - it looks very natural great colors on

02:38 - extra bit of polish to your game if it
02:39 - has any kind of forest or nature setting
02:42 - then an interesting tool for easily
02:44 - handling leaderboards in your game
02:46 - contains all of the features you could
02:48 - possibly want you can browse through
02:50 - user pages you can find a specific id
02:52 - you can highlight the chord player and
02:54 - much more all the data is stored in an
02:56 - easily usable json format and as such it
02:59 - can be easily connected with a remote
03:01 - api for any kind of online storage then
03:04 - for another complete game kit this one
03:06 - is all about making a factory game it
03:08 - looks very feature rich you can easily
03:10 - define custom items and recipes without
03:12 - ever needing to touch any code
03:15 - you can create new buildings producers
03:17 - processors and storage
03:18 - there are smart conveyor belts with tons
03:20 - of customization you can also split and
03:23 - merge them buildings can have multiple
03:25 - inputs and outputs and the whole thing
03:27 - works on a 3d world with elevation
03:29 - support
03:30 - it's also pretty cheap so if you'd like
03:32 - to learn how a game like this is made
03:34 - then you can get this inspect
03:36 - or alternatively you can also download
03:37 - the project files for the factory game
03:39 - that i made myself and look into that
03:40 - one
03:41 - then here's an interesting uv editor
03:43 - that is made exactly for the kind of low
03:45 - poly assets that i'll have to use
03:47 - as you know i use tons of cindy asks in
03:49 - my videos i love the style that they use
03:52 - being low poly means they use lots of
03:53 - flat colors and this simple tool lets
03:56 - you recolor any part of the mesh with a
03:58 - similar click
03:59 - it looks really simple to use you just
04:01 - click and modify the color of anything
04:04 - so if you like using low poly assets
04:05 - then having a tool like this one can be
04:07 - quite useful to get even more out of
04:09 - your assets
04:10 - up next is a simple tool for optimizing
04:13 - your scenes with a single click
04:15 - if you're having trouble with
04:16 - performance due to too many visual
04:18 - assets then a tone like this one can be
04:20 - harmful this tool uses several
04:22 - optimization techniques
04:24 - he uses mesh combining where it merges
04:26 - several meshes into one it handles layer
04:28 - based distance culling occlusion culling
04:30 - and tons more this one is by the same
04:33 - dev that built the gaia and gina terrain
04:35 - tool so you can be confident that it's a
04:37 - very well built tool then for a simple
04:39 - one just a weapon wheel generator it
04:41 - does exactly what you expect helps you
04:43 - generate a simple weapon wheel it's all
04:45 - dynamic so you have tons of parameters
04:47 - you can change to get the exact weapon
04:49 - wheel you want works with both mouse as
04:51 - well as gamepads
04:53 - and then if you like using player preps
04:55 - but you dislike the limitations it has
04:57 - negative like this one can be useful
04:59 - it's basically an extension on player
05:01 - preps adding more features like more
05:03 - data types for example the built-in
05:06 - player press doesn't support the boolean
05:08 - type
05:08 - you can also add encryption you can
05:10 - easily read and write directly in the
05:12 - editor without having to open up the
05:14 - registry
05:15 - so it's a simple tool for working with
05:17 - player perhaps and does exactly what you
