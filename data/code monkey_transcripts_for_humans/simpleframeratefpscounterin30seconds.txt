00:00 - how to make a simple fps counter the
00:02 - simplest method is with some quick math
00:04 - you already have access to time dot
00:06 - delta time this is the number of seconds
00:08 - in lab since in last frame
00:10 - so with some basic math just divide one
00:12 - by down to time and yep it works that's
00:14 - the most basic method although this one
00:16 - is constantly changing for something a
00:18 - bit more stable you can keep track of
00:20 - multiple frames
00:21 - just making lists to store multiple
00:23 - delta times constantly replace your own
00:25 - values with new ones then calculate the
00:27 - average from all of those and now the
00:29 - frame rate reading is nice and smooth
