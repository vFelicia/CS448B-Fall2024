00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset store is full of awesome tools
00:04 - and assets to help you make your own
00:06 - games
00:06 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:08 - coming out every single month so in this
00:10 - video let's check out some of the
00:11 - highlights that were released in may
00:13 - 2021
00:14 - now i was actually planning on making
00:16 - just one video but it turns out there's
00:18 - tons of awesome stuff released in just
00:20 - one month
00:20 - this is the first time that i'm doing
00:22 - this so i don't know if may was an
00:24 - unusual month full of assets or if this
00:26 - is normal amount
00:27 - so in this first video i will be
00:29 - covering a list of free assets and in
00:30 - the next one i will be covering paid
00:32 - assets and tools
00:33 - i will be putting all these videos into
00:35 - one playlist so if you're watching this
00:36 - in the future check the link in the
00:38 - description for all the videos
00:39 - and by the way check out my own assets
00:41 - on the store so far i've made the free
00:43 - key door system
00:44 - which is a super simple way to add keys
00:46 - and doors to your game
00:47 - and the mouse cursor system pro which is
00:50 - a very easy to use tool to help you
00:52 - create custom animated cursors to really
00:54 - make your game stand out
00:55 - i'm currently working on converting some
00:57 - more videos into pro systems so stay
00:59 - tuned for that
01:00 - alright so let's go starting off with
01:02 - the cinematic studio sample
01:04 - this one is officially made by unity
01:06 - it's related to all of the cinematic
01:08 - tools that unity has in order to help
01:10 - you make
01:10 - film tv or animation this is an official
01:13 - sample meant to demonstrate all of those
01:15 - tools in action
01:16 - so it's using timeline to manage all the
01:18 - timing
01:19 - sequences which appears to be a tool for
01:21 - organizing video content i'm not
01:22 - familiar with this one
01:24 - it also uses the recorder which is how
01:25 - you record video files directly inside
01:27 - unity
01:28 - and of course it's all using cinemachine
01:30 - so if you're interested in movie making
01:32 - then this official sample is a great
01:34 - starting point to see all of these
01:36 - awesome movie related things that you
01:37 - can build with unity
01:39 - next up you python 2 this is an
01:41 - interesting one
01:42 - it's a tool for connecting unity with
01:44 - python
01:45 - so for example if you have some python
01:47 - program that you made
01:48 - like maybe something related to machine
01:50 - learning or some data analysis or
01:52 - something like that
01:54 - you can then run that program from unity
01:56 - and get the results
01:57 - it certainly is a niche tool but based
01:59 - on the positive reviews it does exactly
02:01 - what it's meant to do
02:02 - then if you're looking for some assets
02:04 - here is cute people
02:06 - certainly an interesting visual
02:08 - sometimes it seems that all of the
02:09 - low poly assets look exactly the same
02:11 - they all seem to be made by cynthia
02:12 - studios but this one
02:14 - still looks low poly one looking quite
02:16 - different
02:17 - features a demo with a bunch of
02:18 - characters just roaming around and some
02:20 - speech bubbles
02:21 - the characters are set up to work with
02:23 - mechanim so all these standard
02:24 - animations from maximo should work
02:27 - this is a free demo and if you like this
02:29 - style you can grab the phone package
02:31 - or maybe you're looking for some pixel
02:33 - art so here is a pixelated free warrior
02:36 - it's got a total of 14 unique animations
02:39 - you've got running jumping attacking
02:40 - sliding
02:42 - all of them look quite great with quite
02:43 - a bit of polish this is perfect if
02:45 - you're trying to build a quick side
02:47 - scrolling prototype
02:48 - then for another interesting system gen
02:50 - events
02:51 - this is a simple observer pattern made
02:54 - to work with scriptable objects
02:56 - so you have a simple script to trigger
02:58 - an event on a scriptable object
03:00 - and then any number of other scripts
03:02 - listening to that same event on that
03:04 - same object reference
03:05 - it's a very interesting pattern and
03:07 - making it work with scriptable objects
03:09 - is a great way to do it
03:10 - this is also the same thing that the
03:12 - unity team is using in their official
03:14 - unity open project team
03:16 - so if you're interested in this pattern
03:17 - maybe get this asset and inspect the
03:19 - code to see how it all works
03:20 - then for some ui here is a simple
03:23 - progress mark
03:24 - it's exactly what you expect it's got
03:26 - quite a lot of variations
03:28 - from some very simple square bars to
03:30 - some with some rounded edges some with
03:32 - gradients and some with dashes
03:34 - very simple and another tiny thing that
03:35 - would add quite a bit of polish to any
03:37 - small project
03:38 - next up here is a nice aircraft it's an
03:41 - interesting design
03:42 - very cartoony also includes these low
03:44 - poly clouds
03:46 - this one is also a free sample so if you
03:48 - like this design you can get the
03:49 - complete pack
03:50 - if you need some sounds for your car
03:52 - game here is the vehicle essentials
03:54 - features over 100 high quality
03:57 - individual sounds for cars and trucks
03:59 - naturally you have some looping engine
04:01 - sounds then you've got some doors open
04:04 - and closing some horns keys and so on
04:06 - this is great for a quick racing
04:08 - prototype or maybe making a gta clone
04:11 - and if your game is heavily based on
04:13 - physics maybe look into this one
04:14 - the fit box later it makes the boxing
04:17 - letter you have in your object fit with
04:19 - the animation of that object
04:21 - so this can be useful to prevent
04:22 - clipping when you have some wide
04:24 - animations
04:25 - or maybe use it for a fighting game to
04:26 - ensure you have some accurate animated
04:28 - hitboxes
04:30 - and lastly a simple but possibly very
04:32 - useful system
04:33 - the time recorder it keeps track of how
04:35 - long you have the unity editor open on a
04:38 - per
04:38 - project basis now there was a time quite
04:40 - a while ago when i used a bunch of
04:42 - third-party programs to keep track of
04:44 - every minute of every day
04:46 - i did that to see exactly how much time
04:48 - i was working and how much time each
04:50 - game took to make
04:51 - nowadays i mainly just keep track of
04:53 - time in terms of days and months instead
04:55 - of minutes so i no longer use these
04:57 - kinds of programs
04:58 - but especially if you're a hobbyist
05:00 - working on games after your full-time
05:02 - job then this can be quite useful to see
05:04 - the total time it takes you to make a
05:06 - game
05:06 - and if your goal is to eventually make
05:08 - games full time then knowing how fast
05:10 - or slow you work can be a very useful
05:12 - data point
05:13 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
05:15 - assets on the unity asset store that
05:17 - were released in may 2021
05:19 - there's links to all of them in the
05:20 - description stay tuned for the next
05:22 - video that one will be covering some
05:24 - paid assets there's tons of awesome
05:26 - stuff there
05:26 - i hope you found this list useful check
05:28 - the phone plan list to see some more
05:30 - lists with free and paid assets and let
05:32 - me know if you pick up any and what you
05:34 - intend to do with them
05:35 - also check out my own free and paid
05:37 - assets on the store
05:38 - alright hope that's useful check out
05:40 - these videos to learn some more
05:42 - thanks to these awesome patreon
05:43 - supporters for making these videos
05:45 - possible
05:45 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
05:47 - next time
05:52 - [Music]
05:56 - you
