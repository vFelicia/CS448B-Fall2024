01:12 - setting check out this one it's a modern
01:15 - setting at night lots of nice neon
01:17 - lights and some really satisfying rain
01:19 - plenty of roads to drive around both in
01:21 - the city as well as on the outskirts
01:24 - you could just add some simple moving
01:25 - people and a bunch of cars and it
01:27 - wouldn't look great this is the kind of
01:28 - thing that is perfect just to load up
01:30 - this exact demo scene and very quickly
01:32 - get an open worm prototype up and
01:34 - running and next up halloween was last
01:36 - month but if you're in the mood for
01:38 - something spooky here's a grim temple
01:40 - very creepy looking statues and
01:42 - environments and it even has what seems
01:44 - to be some made up language to make it
01:46 - even more spooky these are very high end
01:49 - models with some high quality textures
01:51 - and up next here's a really nice
01:53 - mechabot it's a stylized mesh and
01:56 - texture looks like it would be perfect

02:00 - something like ratchet and clank
02:02 - it includes a model with its great
02:03 - design a bunch of variations and it even
02:05 - includes tons of animations so you could
02:07 - use this either as the enemy or maybe
02:09 - even as your main player then for some
02:11 - vfx here's a bunch of orbs all of them
02:14 - with great visuals all of the ice one

02:29 - check out this one lots of vegetation
02:31 - grass and flowers it makes for some
02:33 - really good looking very calm looking
