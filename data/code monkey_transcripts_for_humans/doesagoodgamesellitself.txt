00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video let's explore the
00:04 - question does a good game sell itself
00:06 - this is a question or rather a statement
00:08 - that is usually made by people
00:10 - unfamiliar with just how difficult it is
00:12 - in the indie game market
00:13 - this video is meant as a companion video
00:15 - to the one i made on the most important
00:17 - skill you need in order to be a
00:18 - successful indie game developer make
00:20 - sure you watch that video before this
00:22 - one especially if you have aspirations
00:24 - of being a successful game developer in
00:26 - there i briefly talk about an example of
00:28 - a game that looked great but failed to
00:30 - find success due to lack of marketing so
00:32 - spoiler alert for the answer to the
00:34 - question in the title no a good game
00:36 - does not sell itself
00:37 - so here let's look at another example
00:39 - and really dive deep and analyze why it
00:42 - failed and what the developers could
00:43 - have done differently to find success my
00:45 - initial goal with this video was
00:47 - actually to cover multiple examples but
00:49 - i think it's better to really dive deep
00:50 - into a single one i have researched this
00:53 - game extensively to figure out why it
00:55 - failed to find success and what could
00:57 - have been done better especially from
00:58 - the standpoint of marketing and i will
01:00 - also give you some tips and hopefully
01:02 - you can apply those to your own games so
01:04 - that your game does not fall into this
01:05 - trap where you don't do any marketing
01:07 - and even if you have a good game you
01:09 - still don't find success and let me just
01:11 - quickly clarify the intent with making
01:13 - this video the goal isn't to bash on
01:15 - this game so if you're the developer
01:16 - please don't take this wrong way in fact
01:18 - the game that i chose is a game that i
01:20 - think looks great i think it's very well
01:22 - made and the players that picked it up
01:24 - do enjoy it so my goal with this video
01:26 - is to analyze what could have gone
01:27 - differently so that a game with this
01:29 - level of quality could have found
01:31 - success and of course this is a learning
01:33 - exercise both for me and for you to see
01:35 - what we can learn from this example and
01:37 - learn what to do and what not to do so
01:40 - your future games have a better chance
01:41 - at finding success so here is the game
01:44 - that i researched really heavily it's
01:46 - called gear shifters it's an arcade
01:48 - action card game it's a pretty unique
01:50 - concept visually the game looks
01:52 - excellent the cars look great and all of
01:54 - the effects are extremely high quality
01:56 - features some interesting boss battles a
01:58 - bunch of car customization with tons of
02:00 - upgrades and many levels even though
02:02 - card games is usually not a genre that
02:04 - i'm all that interested in i still think
02:06 - this one looks great regardless if
02:08 - you're a fan of the genre or not i think
02:10 - we can all agree that this is definitely
02:11 - a well-made game
02:13 - this one is not something that was made
02:14 - by a beginner simply following a simple
02:17 - 5 hour course this one is a proper
02:19 - well-made game so that's the good news
02:21 - the game looks great and if we look at
02:23 - the reviews we can see that it does have
02:25 - very positive reviews however we can
02:28 - look at the number of reviews to get a
02:30 - sales estimate using the box slider
02:32 - method which means you multiply the
02:34 - review amount by a number between 20 and
02:36 - 70 depending on how optimistic or
02:38 - pessimistic you want to be so let's say
02:40 - we multiply by 40. currently the game
02:42 - has 25 reviews so that times 40 means an
02:45 - estimated thousand copies sold at a
02:47 - price point of 25 that means around 25
02:50 - 000 gross revenue that's not such a tiny
02:54 - number but that's gross revenue so it is
02:56 - not what the developer gets at all from
02:59 - that gross revenue then we have to take
03:00 - away refunds and chargebacks like i
03:03 - mentioned in the other video one
03:04 - excellent newsletter is game discover co
03:06 - and they actually did a case study on
03:08 - refunds
03:09 - they found that the rate for refunds is
03:11 - around six to eleven percent
03:13 - and chargebacks are also around one to
03:16 - two percent so for both of these let's
03:18 - assume 10
03:19 - meaning that the initial 25k gross
03:21 - revenue is now just 22.5 k
03:24 - then we have to take away steems cut so
03:26 - that leaves 15.75 after that we take
03:29 - taxes which is going to obviously vary
03:32 - greatly depending on the specifics of
03:33 - the developer maybe on a low tax country
03:36 - that could be something around 10 to 20
03:38 - percent and maybe in a high tax country
03:40 - maybe around 40 to 50 percent so let's
03:42 - take a number in the middle let's say 30
03:44 - percent with that we can't wait that the
03:46 - final total net revenue going into the
03:48 - developer's pocket is around 11k
03:51 - that is much less than the initial 25k
03:53 - which by itself was already pretty small
03:55 - and of course this is revenue it's not
03:57 - profit everyone has costs the developers
03:59 - have to eat so it's doubtful based on
04:01 - this number that this game turned a
04:02 - profit so with this tiny amount we can
04:04 - definitely say that the game sadly
04:06 - failed to find success despite looking
04:08 - like a high quality good game
04:10 - now let's try to identify why that
04:12 - happened and what they could have done
04:13 - differently like i mentioned in the
04:15 - other video one of the most important
04:17 - metrics is followers and wishlist so
04:19 - let's begin there we can go into steamdb
04:22 - and we can see that the game had just
04:23 - 300 followers
04:25 - usually the rate of wishlist to
04:27 - followers is somewhere around 3 to 10x
04:29 - it's a wide range depending on if the
04:31 - game participated in a steam festival or
04:33 - did a free prologue or things like that
04:36 - for this one i couldn't really find any
04:37 - of that so for this game i think we can
04:39 - assume on the lower end of that scale so
04:41 - they probably had around a thousand to
04:43 - 1500 wishlists that is a very very tiny
04:46 - amount once again i'm going to mention
04:48 - the awesome game discover code
04:49 - newsletter by the way this one isn't
04:51 - sponsored or anything i really just love
04:53 - all of the data that they provide they
04:55 - made a study to calculate first week
04:57 - sales from wish lists and the resulting
04:59 - median was about 0.2 meaning that a game
05:02 - that launches with just a thousand
05:03 - wishlists will likely sell just around
05:05 - 200 copies on the first week that does
05:07 - seem to track with the sales estimate of
05:09 - around a thousand units for this game
05:12 - the game has been out for four months so
05:14 - it likely sold around 200 copies on the
05:16 - first week around 600 on the first month
05:18 - and then 400 more in the following three
05:20 - months so the first reason on why this
05:22 - game flopped is simply insufficient
05:24 - number of wishlists with so few
05:26 - wishlists very few people were notified
05:28 - when the game came out then even fewer
05:30 - of those converted into sales which in
05:32 - turn caused the steam algorithm to just
05:34 - bury this game under tons of other games
05:36 - that were simply selling better again
05:38 - that does not mean that those other
05:39 - games were better than this one it
05:41 - really just means that this one did not
05:42 - sound well compared to the competition
05:44 - right at the start and that start is
05:46 - very important steam essentially
05:48 - promotes more of the games that do sell
05:50 - and less of the games that don't sell we
05:52 - can also see that the steam page only
05:54 - went live in april and the game released
05:56 - in september
05:57 - that's just 5 months pretty short amount
05:59 - of time together wish list especially
06:01 - with limited marketing
06:02 - from what little i could find it seems
06:04 - the game was in development at least
06:05 - since early 2020 but i cannot find any
06:08 - mention of it before it was officially
06:10 - announced there's no alpha or better
06:12 - screenshots anywhere the only thing i
06:14 - could find on the game was really just
06:16 - screenshots with the game already fully
06:17 - polished
06:18 - so my tip to you is get that steam page
06:21 - up and running as quickly as possible so
06:23 - you have as much time as possible
06:24 - together wish list and of course post as
06:26 - much as possible obviously you do need
06:29 - to have something to show but don't wait
06:31 - until everything is perfectly polished
06:33 - as long as he chose a nice hook for your
06:34 - game you can definitely post alpha and
06:36 - better screenshots to start gathering an
06:38 - audience that will actually be
06:39 - interested in your game it appears the
06:41 - game did not have any marketing beyond
06:43 - an announcement and a gameplay trailer
06:45 - the publisher really only has a thousand
06:47 - subs on youtube although the trailer
06:49 - does have 30 000 views so that suggests
06:52 - that they experimented with some paid
06:53 - marketing i also couldn't find any
06:56 - launch trailer so that suggests not much
06:58 - of a push when the game actually went
07:00 - live which you absolutely need to do
07:02 - again the goal is increase the number of
07:04 - day one sales so lunch they should have
07:06 - a big push i did manage to find a single
07:09 - mention on reddit on a shmup subreddit
07:12 - like i said in the other video one good
07:13 - way to use reddit is to go to several
07:15 - edits of the genre of your game but it
07:17 - seems like this one was supposed by a
07:19 - player so not really even the developer
07:21 - the game does have a twitter account but
07:23 - almost zero followers the developer has
07:25 - a bunch more but not too much this one
07:28 - is a very giftable game and the store
07:30 - page has some great gifts they did post
07:32 - some gifts on twitter but nowhere near
07:34 - enough
07:34 - they pretty much just starting posting
07:36 - one month before release and at a very
07:38 - slow rate of maybe just one per week the
07:40 - gifts themselves are great i think they
07:42 - are very visual they showcase the game
07:44 - in great light so i think that if they
07:46 - had just posted more over a longer
07:48 - period of time that alone would have
07:50 - made a huge difference these are the
07:52 - kinds of gifs that have the chance to do
07:53 - well on twitter imager reddit and
07:55 - possibly on tiktok
07:57 - so another tip to you if your game is
07:59 - giftable make tons of gifs in advance
08:01 - then slowly release them on every single
08:03 - one of those platforms maybe three to
08:05 - five per week just imagine if the game
08:07 - had the steam page visible for 12 months
08:09 - and posting 3 gifts per week that would
08:11 - be 156 gifts meaning that's 156 chances
08:16 - of finding viral success
08:17 - also the lack of a clear hook didn't
08:19 - help i mentioned the excellent talk by
08:22 - ryan clark in my other video having a
08:24 - good hook is really essential to
08:26 - standing out the game is clearly very
08:28 - well made but there's nothing too unique
08:30 - about it it's a great looking top-down
08:32 - car shooter it's interesting but not
08:34 - something you absolutely feel you need
08:36 - to try
08:37 - for example a game with a really strong
08:39 - hook is super hot the tagline is time
08:42 - moves when you move and as soon as you
08:43 - hear that you know you absolutely need
08:45 - to try it it's a very unique very
08:47 - compelling hook whereas here it's a car
08:50 - combat game so that's more unique than a
08:52 - simple car driving game but not too
08:54 - hockey that you absolutely need to try
08:56 - then we get to price which might also
08:58 - have slightly hurt the game it looks
09:01 - excellent at doing exactly what you
09:02 - expect but like i mentioned there's no
09:04 - unique hook it's really just a very well
09:06 - made game charging 25 nowadays is a
09:09 - really a premium price point for an
09:11 - indie game you really need to give the
09:13 - player something truly special for that
09:15 - price point
09:16 - just think of all of the awesome games
09:17 - that you could get for that amount 25 is
09:20 - definitely on the upper range of the
09:22 - triple a indie games and it is an
09:24 - especially high price especially when
09:26 - you have a low amount of wish list with
09:28 - that few people that already know about
09:30 - the game you're really only going to
09:31 - sell to impulse buyers and 25 dollars is
09:34 - way off on the impulse range
09:36 - now as to what i think the game did well
09:38 - in terms of marketing i think the
09:40 - trailer is great and like i said the
09:41 - game itself looks great marketing is
09:44 - very visual so the fact that the game
09:45 - looks great definitely helps
09:47 - the name is also pretty good it's unique
09:49 - but not too unique that's a good thing
09:52 - you want your game to give the player
09:53 - some idea of what the game is like but
09:55 - you also don't want it to be too unique
09:57 - that no one will remember it i think the
09:59 - capsule image is well made and the store
10:01 - page is very well crafted with tons of
10:03 - high quality gifs that sound great
10:06 - they also have a mailing list on their
10:07 - website so that's good although not sure
10:10 - how much traffic they get on the website
10:12 - so without driving people towards it
10:14 - from external sources i would guess they
10:16 - really didn't have many signups so in
10:18 - the end it really comes down to those
10:19 - wishlists the game launched with a very
10:21 - tiny amount of wishlists which means no
10:23 - one knew about it answering the question
10:25 - in the beginning of the video does a
10:27 - good game sound itself
10:28 - in this case the answer is a very clear
10:30 - no the game looks great the reviews like
10:33 - the game but it absolutely did not sell
10:35 - itself now i should also mention that
10:37 - this one is also available on the
10:39 - playstation store on xbox and on the
10:41 - nintendo switch and on top of that it
10:43 - even has a physical edition so it's
10:46 - possible that maybe this game as a whole
10:48 - did find success it's possible that it's
10:50 - owned much better on those other
10:51 - platforms compared to steam so in the
10:53 - end maybe it might have done well
10:56 - but still we can say for sure that this
10:57 - game despite looking like a great game
10:59 - definitely flopped on scene however this
11:01 - is also not necessarily the end of this
11:03 - story on scene you can participate in
11:05 - the weekly sales every two months and
11:08 - you have the regular steam sales on
11:09 - spring summer and winter
11:11 - given how the game is of a high quality
11:13 - i do think it will have a decently long
11:15 - tail as the discount goes up to 50 and
11:18 - higher i do see the game selling more
11:20 - and more and if more and more people
11:22 - enjoy and review the game it will
11:23 - possibly be promoted more and more again
11:26 - coming back from a difficult launch is
11:28 - extremely difficult but even if you
11:30 - can't really come back from a battle
11:31 - launch you can still have a decent tail
11:33 - also one quick note specifically on the
11:35 - steam algorithm there are four buckets
11:38 - of reviews which greatly affect
11:39 - visibility if you have less than 10
11:41 - reviews the score isn't even visible
11:43 - this is really bad so you absolutely
11:45 - need to get 10 reviews asap
11:48 - the next one is between 10 and 49
11:50 - reviews
11:51 - at that point you do see the score but
11:53 - it's still pretty bad for visibility
11:55 - the next one is above 50 reviews this is
11:57 - where you want to be as quickly as
11:59 - possible ideally on the first day or
12:01 - maybe second or third by then you should
12:03 - really be at 50 or more reviews if not
12:06 - it's a really tricky start
12:08 - and the final one is at 500 reviews and
12:10 - that one is really tricky and that's
12:12 - when you start seeing scores like
12:13 - overwhelmingly positive as you can see
12:15 - this game did not manage to hit 50
12:17 - reviews even now several months after
12:19 - release until it gets that much it's
12:21 - going to be really tricky to attract a
12:23 - large amount of players so my tip to you
12:25 - as a game developer is definitely
12:26 - encourage your players to leave reviews
12:28 - and also my tip to you as a player if
12:30 - there's a game you're playing and you're
12:31 - enjoying it do make sure to write a
12:33 - review they really help the developer
12:35 - again let me mention one more time if
12:37 - you're the developer of this game please
12:38 - don't take this video as negative
12:40 - criticism i'm literally saying the game
12:42 - is good and i think sales are subpar
12:44 - compared to the quality of the game i
12:46 - really don't want anyone to see this
12:47 - video as me bashing on some game that
12:49 - didn't do well i know what it feels like
12:51 - to have a flop and i really don't want
12:52 - to make anyone's day worse all i want to
12:54 - do with this video is explore and learn
12:56 - from this example so that you or i can
12:58 - have better chance of finding success
13:00 - with our games let me know if you'd like
13:02 - to see more videos kind of like this
13:04 - where i dive deep into some game and
13:05 - investigate why it did not do well i
13:08 - think that could be a useful format to
13:09 - learn more about marketing and how to
13:11 - actually find success with your games
13:13 - learning from others mistakes is one of
13:15 - the best ways for you to avoid those
13:16 - same mistakes yourself alright hope
13:18 - that's useful check out these videos to
13:20 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
13:22 - patreon supporters for making these
13:24 - videos possible thank you for watching
13:26 - and i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's explore the question does a good game sell itself this is a question or rather a statement that is usually made by people unfamiliar with just how difficult it is in the indie game market this video is meant as a companion video to the one i made on the most important skill you need in order to be a successful indie game developer make sure you watch that video before this one especially if you have aspirations of being a successful game developer in there i briefly talk about an example of a game that looked great but failed to find success due to lack of marketing so spoiler alert for the answer to the question in the title no a good game does not sell itself so here let's look at another example and really dive deep and analyze why it failed and what the developers could have done differently to find success my initial goal with this video was actually to cover multiple examples but i think it's better to really dive deep into a single one i have researched this game extensively to figure out why it failed to find success and what could have been done better especially from the standpoint of marketing and i will also give you some tips and hopefully you can apply those to your own games so that your game does not fall into this trap where you don't do any marketing and even if you have a good game you still don't find success and let me just quickly clarify the intent with making this video the goal isn't to bash on this game so if you're the developer please don't take this wrong way in fact the game that i chose is a game that i think looks great i think it's very well made and the players that picked it up do enjoy it so my goal with this video is to analyze what could have gone differently so that a game with this level of quality could have found success and of course this is a learning exercise both for me and for you to see what we can learn from this example and learn what to do and what not to do so your future games have a better chance at finding success so here is the game that i researched really heavily it's called gear shifters it's an arcade action card game it's a pretty unique concept visually the game looks excellent the cars look great and all of the effects are extremely high quality features some interesting boss battles a bunch of car customization with tons of upgrades and many levels even though card games is usually not a genre that i'm all that interested in i still think this one looks great regardless if you're a fan of the genre or not i think we can all agree that this is definitely a wellmade game this one is not something that was made by a beginner simply following a simple 5 hour course this one is a proper wellmade game so that's the good news the game looks great and if we look at the reviews we can see that it does have very positive reviews however we can look at the number of reviews to get a sales estimate using the box slider method which means you multiply the review amount by a number between 20 and 70 depending on how optimistic or pessimistic you want to be so let's say we multiply by 40. currently the game has 25 reviews so that times 40 means an estimated thousand copies sold at a price point of 25 that means around 25 000 gross revenue that's not such a tiny number but that's gross revenue so it is not what the developer gets at all from that gross revenue then we have to take away refunds and chargebacks like i mentioned in the other video one excellent newsletter is game discover co and they actually did a case study on refunds they found that the rate for refunds is around six to eleven percent and chargebacks are also around one to two percent so for both of these let's assume 10 meaning that the initial 25k gross revenue is now just 22.5 k then we have to take away steems cut so that leaves 15.75 after that we take taxes which is going to obviously vary greatly depending on the specifics of the developer maybe on a low tax country that could be something around 10 to 20 percent and maybe in a high tax country maybe around 40 to 50 percent so let's take a number in the middle let's say

to followers is somewhere around 3 to 10x it's a wide range depending on if the game participated in a steam festival or did a free prologue or things like that for this one i couldn't really find any of that so for this game i think we can assume on the lower end of that scale so they probably had around a thousand to 1500 wishlists that is a very very tiny amount once again i'm going to mention the awesome game discover code newsletter by the way this one isn't sponsored or anything i really just love all of the data that they provide they made a study to calculate first week sales from wish lists and the resulting median was about 0.2 meaning that a game that launches with just a thousand wishlists will likely sell just around 200 copies on the first week that does seem to track with the sales estimate of around a thousand units for this game the game has been out for four months so it likely sold around 200 copies on the first week around 600 on the first month and then 400 more in the following three months so the first reason on why this game flopped is simply insufficient number of wishlists with so few wishlists very few people were notified when the game came out then even fewer of those converted into sales which in turn caused the steam algorithm to just bury this game under tons of other games that were simply selling better again that does not mean that those other games were better than this one it really just means that this one did not sound well compared to the competition right at the start and that start is very important steam essentially promotes more of the games that do sell and less of the games that don't sell we can also see that the steam page only went live in april and the game released in september that's just 5 months pretty short amount of time together wish list especially with limited marketing from what little i could find it seems the game was in development at least since early 2020 but i cannot find any mention of it before it was officially announced there's no alpha or better screenshots anywhere the only thing i could find on the game was really just screenshots with the game already fully polished so my tip to you is get that steam page up and running as quickly as possible so you have as much time as possible together wish list and of course post as much as possible obviously you do need to have something to show but don't wait until everything is perfectly polished as long as he chose a nice hook for your game you can definitely post alpha and better screenshots to start gathering an audience that will actually be interested in your game it appears the game did not have any marketing beyond an announcement and a gameplay trailer the publisher really only has a thousand subs on youtube although the trailer does have 30 000 views so that suggests that they experimented with some paid marketing i also couldn't find any launch trailer so that suggests not much of a push when the game actually went live which you absolutely need to do again the goal is increase the number of day one sales so lunch they should have a big push i did manage to find a single mention on reddit on a shmup subreddit like i said in the other video one good way to use reddit is to go to several edits of the genre of your game but it seems like this one was supposed by a player so not really even the developer the game does have a twitter account but almost zero followers the developer has a bunch more but not too much this one is a very giftable game and the store page has some great gifts they did post some gifts on twitter but nowhere near enough they pretty much just starting posting one month before release and at a very slow rate of maybe just one per week the gifts themselves are great i think they are very visual they showcase the game in great light so i think that if they had just posted more over a longer period of time that alone would have made a huge difference these are the kinds of gifs that have the chance to do well on twitter imager reddit and possibly on tiktok so another tip to you if your game is giftable make tons of gifs in advance then slowly release them on every single one of those platforms maybe three to five per week just imagine if the game had the steam page visible for 12 months and posting 3 gifts per week that would be 156 gifts meaning that's 156 chances of finding viral success also the lack of a clear hook didn't help i mentioned the excellent talk by ryan clark in my other video having a good hook is really essential to standing out the game is clearly very well made but there's nothing too unique about it it's a great looking topdown car shooter it's interesting but not something you absolutely feel you need to try for example a game with a really strong hook is super hot the tagline is time moves when you move and as soon as you hear that you know you absolutely need to try it it's a very unique very compelling hook whereas here it's a car combat game so that's more unique than a simple car driving game but not too hockey that you absolutely need to try then we get to price which might also have slightly hurt the game it looks excellent at doing exactly what you expect but like i mentioned there's no unique hook it's really just a very well made game charging 25 nowadays is a really a premium price point for an indie game you really need to give the player something truly special for that price point just think of all of the awesome games that you could get for that amount 25 is definitely on the upper range of the triple a indie games and it is an especially high price especially when you have a low amount of wish list with that few people that already know about the game you're really only going to sell to impulse buyers and 25 dollars is way off on the impulse range now as to what i think the game did well in terms of marketing i think the trailer is great and like i said the game itself looks great marketing is very visual so the fact that the game looks great definitely helps the name is also pretty good it's unique but not too unique that's a good thing you want your game to give the player some idea of what the game is like but you also don't want it to be too unique that no one will remember it i think the capsule image is well made and the store page is very well crafted with tons of high quality gifs that sound great they also have a mailing list on their website so that's good although not sure how much traffic they get on the website so without driving people towards it from external sources i would guess they really didn't have many signups so in the end it really comes down to those wishlists the game launched with a very tiny amount of wishlists which means no one knew about it answering the question in the beginning of the video does a good game sound itself in this case the answer is a very clear no the game looks great the reviews like the game but it absolutely did not sell itself now i should also mention that this one is also available on the playstation store on xbox and on the nintendo switch and on top of that it even has a physical edition so it's possible that maybe this game as a whole did find success it's possible that it's owned much better on those other platforms compared to steam so in the end maybe it might have done well but still we can say for sure that this game despite looking like a great game definitely flopped on scene however this is also not necessarily the end of this story on scene you can participate in the weekly sales every two months and you have the regular steam sales on spring summer and winter given how the game is of a high quality i do think it will have a decently long tail as the discount goes up to 50 and higher i do see the game selling more and more and if more and more people enjoy and review the game it will possibly be promoted more and more again coming back from a difficult launch is extremely difficult but even if you can't really come back from a battle launch you can still have a decent tail also one quick note specifically on the steam algorithm there are four buckets of reviews which greatly affect visibility if you have less than 10 reviews the score isn't even visible this is really bad so you absolutely need to get 10 reviews asap the next one is between 10 and 49 reviews at that point you do see the score but it's still pretty bad for visibility the next one is above 50 reviews this is where you want to be as quickly as possible ideally on the first day or maybe second or third by then you should really be at 50 or more reviews if not it's a really tricky start and the final one is at 500 reviews and that one is really tricky and that's when you start seeing scores like overwhelmingly positive as you can see this game did not manage to hit 50 reviews even now several months after release until it gets that much it's going to be really tricky to attract a large amount of players so my tip to you as a game developer is definitely encourage your players to leave reviews and also my tip to you as a player if there's a game you're playing and you're enjoying it do make sure to write a review they really help the developer again let me mention one more time if you're the developer of this game please don't take this video as negative criticism i'm literally saying the game is good and i think sales are subpar compared to the quality of the game i really don't want anyone to see this video as me bashing on some game that didn't do well i know what it feels like to have a flop and i really don't want to make anyone's day worse all i want to do with this video is explore and learn from this example so that you or i can have better chance of finding success with our games let me know if you'd like to see more videos kind of like this where i dive deep into some game and investigate why it did not do well i think that could be a useful format to learn more about marketing and how to actually find success with your games learning from others mistakes is one of the best ways for you to avoid those same mistakes yourself alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
