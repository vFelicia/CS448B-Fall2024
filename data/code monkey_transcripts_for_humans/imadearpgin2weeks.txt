00:00 - in this video we're going to check out a
00:01 - nice RPG I made in two weeks for a game
00:04 - jam it features an over map with enemies
00:06 - and NPCs a turn-based battle system and
00:09 - a nice small story with dialogue and
00:11 - cutscenes let's begin
00:15 - [Music]
00:19 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:22 - and this channel is all about helping
00:23 - you will learn how to make your own
00:25 - games with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:27 - professional indie game developer so if
00:28 - you find the video helpful consider
00:30 - subscribing so first of all this game is
00:32 - an entry to the easy allies Glenys
00:34 - countering game jam you can play the
00:36 - game on itch and like every other video
00:38 - on the channel you can download the
00:39 - project files from the website I've been
00:42 - a big fan of easy allies since they were
00:43 - game trailers and I've been meaning to
00:45 - join a game jam for some time if you're
00:47 - not familiar with easy unless they are a
00:49 - group of awesome people who cover gaming
00:51 - news reviews and more so check out their
00:53 - YouTube channel so with this being such
00:55 - a unique and interesting game jam I
00:57 - thought it was time to give it a shot
00:58 - the uniqueness of the game jam was in
01:01 - making a game with a bunch of weird
01:02 - rooms designed to annoy the player for
01:04 - example one of the rules was to make
01:06 - character that randomly trips up the
01:07 - player another one is to have the
01:09 - characters constantly talk about
01:11 - mountain dew and have a very garish
01:12 - looking armor the end result of all that
01:15 - is a nice small RPG with a turn-based
01:17 - battle system with various characters
01:18 - and enemies the game is actually quite
01:21 - complex and the reason I've been able to
01:23 - make it in such a short amount of time
01:24 - is due to what I always talk about the
01:26 - videos which is the importance of
01:28 - writing clean reusable code as I go
01:30 - through an overview of how the game was
01:32 - made you won't see many elements which
01:33 - were created previously and simply added
01:35 - on to this game so if you've been
01:37 - following the channel for some time you
01:39 - might recognize various elements let's
01:41 - start off by going through part of the
01:43 - game and then we'll go more in-depth
01:44 - into how each system works if you like
01:47 - you can pause the video right now and go
01:49 - play the game then come back here to
01:51 - continue watching the game is rather
01:53 - quick only around 20 minutes so go play
01:55 - it right now so the video doesn't spoil
01:57 - anything alright let's get to it we
02:00 - start off in a rather simple main menu
02:02 - here we just have gotten to play and
02:05 - want to quit as we hit play we can see
02:07 - the recipe which are the weird rules
02:09 - that the game must abide by so as you
02:11 - can see we have an extremely annoying
02:13 - sidekick
02:13 - then the button to taunt the NPC's is
02:16 - the same as the used consumable the
02:18 - player has a different sprite in the
02:19 - portrait the enemy wins in a cutscene
02:22 - and so on
02:23 - okay so continue here are the controls
02:26 - very simple movement and interaction now
02:29 - here we are in the game itself and we
02:31 - start the story
02:32 - we have a simple dialogue system with
02:34 - some text writing once the intro text is
02:37 - done then here we are in the over map so
02:41 - here we can move around very simple
02:43 - movement and we keep moving in counter
02:45 - our first enemy we talk to him and after
02:48 - a while we go into our battle screen so
02:51 - here we are in a very simple turn-based
02:53 - battle system
02:54 - I've actually covered this in a separate
02:55 - video last week now we can do our simple
02:58 - attack there he goes attacks once it's
03:00 - done it's the enemy's turn and he does
03:01 - his own attack and in this case he
03:03 - missed so we can keep attack him and
03:06 - destroy him
03:06 - we go back into the Oval map and the
03:08 - enemy has been destroyed keep going and
03:10 - we go into another fight now here we are
03:14 - and on this battle system we also have a
03:17 - special move the special differs per
03:19 - characters so our three different
03:21 - classes have three different special
03:23 - attacks this one is a powerful kick so
03:26 - president boom there he goes then when
03:30 - it's done it's on a cool-down so we now
03:32 - do our normal attacks to defeat town
03:33 - right there it is another one now we
03:37 - keep going
03:38 - and eventually you find our character
03:40 - which is blocking our passage first he
03:43 - starts off as an enemy so we need to
03:45 - defeat them
03:56 - and now we won and now he joins our team
03:59 - as he joins his annoying sidekick comes
04:03 - along with us so just like now we now
04:05 - have another member in our party now
04:08 - sleazier again one of the rules is to
04:10 - trip me up and yep he does it right away
04:12 - so I cannot move and that is indeed
04:13 - quite annoying so we keep going into
04:16 - this nice map and as we reach the town
04:20 - we have to go and talk to this NPC which
04:23 - is the other room where another NPC just
04:26 - randomly has the exact same sprite as
04:27 - the player and it is never explained
04:29 - then we keep going and go into a nice
04:32 - simple tavern and over here we get
04:37 - ambushed by enemies there you go some
04:39 - nice particle effects and yep we go into
04:41 - another battle so now we have two
04:43 - members in our team against three
04:45 - enemies so I can do a normal attack with
04:47 - this one and now on the tank character
04:50 - it has a different special so we hit it
04:52 - if there you go a nice AoE attack any of
04:55 - we win when we win then the humor which
04:58 - is the final character joins our party
04:59 - alright so this is the basics for how
05:02 - the game goes we move around the map we
05:05 - talk to NPCs from a story and pattern in
05:07 - a turn-based battle system so this is a
05:10 - fully functional simple RPG that was
05:12 - built in two weeks and you can go to
05:14 - edge to play the whole game and also you
05:16 - can download the project files from the
05:18 - website so you can see how all of this
05:19 - is set up so now that we've seen an
05:22 - overview let's see how each system is
05:24 - set up and what systems I've managed to
05:26 - reuse starting with the main menu here
05:28 - it is very simple we just have some
05:30 - buttons to play and quit and a bunch of
05:33 - extra buttons with information on the
05:34 - side the way the transitions are made is
05:37 - essentially with different selves so we
05:40 - start off with the south main then we
05:41 - hit play then we go into the recipe play
05:44 - so this one shows then we go into the
05:46 - controls and then we go into the game so
05:49 - here we are in the main menu hit play
05:50 - and there we go
05:51 - and the text is animated and pops up
05:54 - over time and we hit play and here it is
05:57 - just a simple thing and hit play okay so
06:00 - here we are in our game scene we start
06:01 - off with some story exposition so in
06:04 - here I've made this simple dialogue
06:06 - system it is very simple it only has two
06:09 - of all characters and text being written
06:11 - right now there's only one character
06:13 - talking so the right one is hidden so we
06:15 - can pause in order to go up here in turn
06:18 - look at our UI and here it is the
06:20 - download window and how it's set up so
06:22 - we have left character than the right
06:23 - character which is currently hidden live
06:25 - chat bubble right left name and right
06:27 - name this is a very simple dialogue
06:30 - system but the game is meant to be
06:31 - extremely simple so it's perfect for
06:33 - this scenario so let me know in the
06:34 - comments if you'd like to see a video
06:36 - dedicated to building a dialogue system
06:38 - now one of the rules is for the player
06:40 - sprite to be different in the portrait
06:41 - and in the over map so that's why the
06:43 - player has that sprite and in here the
06:45 - portrait is different once we get
06:47 - through the starting story here it is
06:48 - our main character the movement code was
06:51 - made in the simple character movement
06:53 - video so I can move them around with a
06:55 - keyboard but it would also be possible
06:57 - to use gamepad input now over here we
07:00 - have some hitboxes so if I go in there I
07:02 - cannot leave the map so the player is
07:04 - constrained to the plane area and if we
07:06 - pause we can see how the map is set up
07:08 - so here it is the entire game these game
07:12 - objects are what defines the various
07:14 - events that happened over the course of
07:16 - the game so as you can see in here the
07:18 - player start up in here this starts off
07:20 - the first enemy that has a specific text
07:22 - then the second one and then the tank
07:24 - gets spawned in here this laser and so
07:26 - on so as we move you can see everything
07:29 - is set up the map is on inside a nice
07:32 - game object where we have the visuals
07:34 - and also our hit boxes so there yo these
07:36 - are all the hitboxes so here for exemple
07:39 - you can see there's an invisible head
07:40 - box here to make sure that the player
07:42 - correctly interacts with this enemy
07:43 - before going through when he defeats
07:45 - this enemy then this head box won't
07:47 - become disabled so the player can keep
07:49 - moving and so on and so on so in here
07:51 - the same thing this one is blocked then
07:53 - it defeats the tank then the sprite and
07:56 - the hitbox both get vanished and as you
07:58 - can see on the entire map it's pretty
08:00 - simple since this is a very simple game
08:02 - jam game so we simply have this path so
08:04 - the player goes here goes here then
08:07 - keeps moving fight the evil monster get
08:09 - stuck in the dungeon moves towards evil
08:11 - monster - it was back in the dungeon
08:12 - then this head box disappears then he
08:15 - moves through into the third evil
08:17 - monster encounter for the enemies you
08:20 - can see that they have some very
08:22 - roaming behavior so there he is stopped
08:24 - and after a while he simply moves to a
08:26 - position nearby his spawn position and
08:29 - all the NPCs are simply I don't just
08:31 - stand or decode for the enemy overlap is
08:34 - also very simple since all the combat is
08:37 - done on a separate scene the code in
08:39 - here similar looks to see if the player
08:40 - is nearby and moved towards him
08:42 - so in here if the player is within a
08:45 - certain target range then he moves
08:47 - towards him and if he is within a attack
08:49 - range then we have our interaction which
08:52 - then depending on this character type
08:54 - you won't either unload the starting
08:56 - cutscenes article simply unload an enemy
08:58 - encounter okay so let's approach our
09:01 - first enemy here we are let's move to
09:04 - the right and there's the enemy right
09:05 - there he sees me moves towards and
09:07 - engages the cutscene now you can see
09:10 - that dialogue is between two characters
09:12 - so here's the dialogue window and as you
09:14 - can see the left character is now
09:16 - slightly faded which only means this one
09:18 - is on gray now we keep talking and there
09:21 - you go some nice text writer on the text
09:23 - along with some sound and after a while
09:25 - here we go we go into our battle now
09:28 - I've covered the creation of this
09:29 - turn-based battle system in the last
09:31 - video so go check that out to see how it
09:33 - was made here this one has a couple more
09:35 - features unlike for example multiple
09:36 - targets and special attacks but the
09:39 - basics are do a normal attack there you
09:40 - go attacks now it's his turn now he goes
09:42 - attacks and so on right so once we
09:45 - defeat him we go back into our over map
09:47 - and the enemy was killed so he no longer
09:50 - gets spawned when you go back into the
09:51 - over map well let's go into another
09:53 - battle just so we can take some damage
09:56 - okay so here we are we took some damage
09:58 - and now we need to go back into the over
10:00 - map there you go our health matches so
10:02 - the healthcare is between battle to
10:04 - battle how that is set up is by using a
10:07 - simple character class and let's see how
10:08 - its set up here it is the character
10:11 - class over here we have a type for each
10:14 - unique type then we also have some basic
10:17 - stats and down here on our constructor
10:20 - we receive a type and based on that type
10:23 - we initialize these stats so here the
10:25 - player starts off with 35 attack 120
10:28 - health and so on gaming Senshi AIT's a
10:30 - character when the game starts and keeps
10:33 - them in memory throughout the
10:34 - game that memory stored here in a game
10:37 - data class we have the various states
10:39 - that handle the story state and all the
10:42 - characters are stored in a simple list
10:44 - so they had initialized just once and
10:46 - there you go everything is like that for
10:48 - adding them here it is manually adding
10:50 - all the important characters so the
10:52 - player tanks laser in the healer and
10:53 - then it cycles through the map which is
10:56 - the map prefab that you saw previously
10:57 - and we insensate the characters that
11:00 - means in order to edit the map all we
11:02 - need to do is go in here and modify our
11:04 - prefab so in here I could have mana mean
11:07 - here by simply duplicating that game
11:09 - object and having it in there the data
11:11 - that is used to instantiate the
11:13 - character is stored in this simple model
11:15 - behavior so it is the position of the
11:18 - game object and then these stats to make
11:20 - sure which character it should be
11:21 - spawned so that's pretty much how the
11:23 - world design works just a bunch of game
11:25 - objects that define positions and what
11:27 - character type should be on that
11:28 - position
11:29 - okay now let's continue with the game
11:31 - now after fighting the first two we
11:34 - reach the tank blocking the tower
11:35 - entrance now there are four types of
11:38 - characters on the / map there's the
11:40 - player then there's the enemies then we
11:42 - have NPCs and farmers right now the tank
11:45 - is an NPC so he's just standing around
11:47 - and not doing anything by being near an
11:50 - NPC and pressing the interact but I can
11:52 - start a cutscene the cutscene that gets
11:55 - started depends on the game state so the
11:58 - aim state is stored in here on the game
12:00 - data as you can see we have just a very
12:02 - simple state variable and we leave
12:05 - various states so we do a switch and if
12:06 - we were interacting with an NPC and we
12:09 - are on a certain state then we start a
12:10 - certain cutting okay so over here we
12:13 - talk to the tank very simple and again
12:17 - here we are back in our battle scene
12:19 - with a different enemy type and over
12:21 - here I can now use a special for a very
12:23 - powerful kick now he attacks he does his
12:27 - normal attack and now normal time okay
12:30 - so just like this now I've defeated the
12:32 - tank and we go back into the over map
12:34 - and again it is the state to load the
12:36 - correct cutscene and over here we talked
12:39 - some like this name and go back to the
12:41 - over most so here we are back in the
12:43 - over map and slizzer immediately does
12:45 - his own thing
12:46 - now the tank is a forward instead of an
12:49 - NPC so that means he keeps track of the
12:50 - distance to the player and if it's far
12:52 - enough he moves towards him and that's
12:54 - it sneezer has a timer on his script and
12:58 - after a certain amount of time there you
13:01 - go he runs towards a player as soon as
13:03 - he gets within a certain distance the
13:05 - player trips up plays a small animation
13:07 - and can no longer move until it gets
13:09 - back up and everything proceeds so you
13:12 - see we also have various chat bombs
13:14 - being popped up these ones related to
13:16 - the fountain view are simple prefabs so
13:18 - they simply get in Senshi ated they are
13:21 - static prefabs in order to be able to
13:23 - have an image in the middle of the text
13:25 - whereas the other ones where this laser
13:27 - says and he replies those are dynamic
13:30 - chat bubbles meaning that the background
13:32 - extends based on the text so those are
13:35 - very similar to how the tone tip works
13:37 - okay continuing in the game we also have
13:39 - a nice quest arrow pointer this was also
13:42 - created in a previous video you saw
13:44 - previously pointing towards the tank
13:46 - with an exclamation mark and right now
13:48 - it's pointing there to the right and if
13:50 - we approach there go the position turns
13:52 - into 1x and when we get within a certain
13:55 - distance of our target there you go we
13:58 - unload another cutscene when we finish
14:00 - this cutscene there you go it's now
14:03 - pointing into a different direction and
14:05 - with a different color and as soon as we
14:07 - go there you go we nice exclamation
14:09 - point again check out the dedicated
14:11 - video to see how that works it's a very
14:13 - simple element now this character here
14:15 - is the one that is the examine like the
14:17 - player but never acknowledged so we
14:19 - talked to him and now we go towards the
14:21 - tavern and over here we have a bunch of
14:25 - NPCs just playing a simple iPhone
14:27 - animation over here is a healer which is
14:30 - currently just an NPC so he's not doing
14:32 - anything and when we approach this
14:34 - position it won't load another cutscene
14:37 - where the enemies won't ambushers now
14:39 - how that is set up we can see over here
14:41 - pause and go over here and here they are
14:44 - they get spawned right here in this
14:46 - corner so they're essentially just out
14:48 - of view and when we start the cutscene
14:51 - we won't play some nice particle effects
14:53 - and then they won't be teleported on to
14:55 - their correct positions so let's see
14:57 - that in action
14:58 - here we go start each cutscene all right
15:01 - now see the particle effects and now
15:04 - those characters get teleported in there
15:05 - as you can see they are no longer on the
15:07 - court okay so now is a good time to look
15:09 - at how the cutscenes are set up over
15:12 - here is a nice static classic contains
15:14 - all the cutscenes so down here we can go
15:17 - to the tavern ambush here is the tavern
15:20 - ambush cutscene so in this case we start
15:23 - off by destroying the pointer then we
15:26 - show the UI a black background we stop
15:29 - the over map from running so on the
15:31 - enemy stop roaming then we set the
15:33 - dialogue actions the dialogue is very
15:35 - simple so it only works linearly so
15:37 - essentially every action follows another
15:39 - one so we set those actions then we go
15:43 - into the very first one where we show
15:44 - the dialogue window then Sheldon left
15:47 - character with this pride show the
15:48 - unlife character name left text hide the
15:51 - right character right tags right name
15:53 - then when we go into the cutscene for
15:56 - the enemy spawning here it is we get the
15:59 - player position then we position the
16:01 - enemies in sin she ate some smoke
16:03 - particles and then we hide them so they
16:06 - are hidden while see smoke animation is
16:08 - playing and after a short amount of time
16:10 - they become visible all the timing is
16:14 - handled in here by the function timer
16:15 - which is a class from the code monkey
16:17 - utilities that you can get from the
16:18 - website then we keep going through our
16:21 - dialogue the enemy says his text and
16:24 - then we load our enemy encounter so all
16:27 - the cutscenes in the game are handled by
16:29 - this class so as you can see all of them
16:31 - play thanked after join play tank before
16:33 - join and so on we have all them ok so
16:37 - back into our game let's go through the
16:40 - dialogue and into battle and here as you
16:43 - can see we have multiple enemies and
16:44 - also the tank is now on our team so can
16:48 - select target and let's hit that one up
16:49 - there and now again the special attack
16:51 - is different so we can now try out the
16:53 - tank special attack and there you a nice
16:57 - AoE effect
16:59 - ok let's defeat them and here we are now
17:03 - we meet the human so now with all the
17:05 - team members in our party we can carry
17:07 - on with our quest well as soon as
17:09 - sleazier wants me go
17:10 - so let's wait
17:11 - if there is he is indeed very annoying
17:13 - okay so keep going and we're going to go
17:15 - into our shopkeeper and talk to him and
17:19 - there you go a very simple dialogue and
17:21 - when it's done we have the simplest
17:23 - basic shop possible and here we just
17:26 - have a very basic UI window here it is a
17:29 - UI window with just a few buttons Garen
17:33 - button is disabled and the others add
17:35 - points to either our health or our found
17:37 - you amount so just click on it and there
17:40 - you go our in your goes up and the store
17:42 - goes out of stock and so on now these
17:45 - ends are stored over here on the game
17:47 - data we just have two very simple ends
17:51 - okay so we keep going with the game and
17:54 - I last thing that I want to show is the
17:56 - animated cutscenes so here we are
17:59 - fighting the evil monster for the first
18:01 - time now the rules say that the monster
18:04 - should somehow we reckon Slee win the
18:06 - fight even though we kill me so we get
18:07 - them down to zero HP ok let's see if he
18:21 - dies on this hips and there we go as
18:24 - soon as he dies plays the animated
18:25 - cutscene and here we go he goes any
18:27 - spawns from behind any punches to play
18:29 - so just like that he miraculously won
18:31 - even though we actually destroyed and
18:34 - when we're done again based on our game
18:36 - state we now we had teleport into the
18:37 - dungeon and we start in here
18:39 - so here we meet the other character and
18:43 - after talking to him for a while he
18:46 - decides to untie us and there you go
18:50 - just simple movement and destroying the
18:52 - rope game objects before continuing on
18:54 - with down there we go the same particle
18:56 - effect he vanishes and here we are back
18:58 - into the cutscene so that's pretty much
19:01 - it for all of the unique elements of the
19:03 - game so again if we pause we can see the
19:06 - entire path of the game so we are right
19:08 - here in the dungeon so now the goal is
19:10 - to go in here meet the evil monster for
19:12 - the second time and we're going to lose
19:13 - again then we go back here then this
19:15 - package gets destroyed and we can then
19:19 - go and find the third battle where we
19:21 - can finally win let's just go over here
19:24 - to the second chair
19:25 - which has a fun new armor and that is
19:27 - again here on the character Spandana
19:29 - simply a bone has found your armor so
19:31 - when this shopkeeper is spawn he has the
19:34 - armor so let's meet him
19:37 - and also else in the over map we can
19:39 - press base in order to use one of the
19:41 - health potions and we heal everyone on
19:43 - the team ok so here we are talk to him
19:46 - and he has the armor available so click
19:48 - on it and there you go we equip the
19:50 - armor and there it is it replaced our
19:52 - previous body so now the player is
19:54 - wearing the special armor now the way
19:57 - this works is by replacing pixels on the
19:59 - players spreadsheet so in here we can
20:00 - pause look at the player spreadsheet and
20:03 - there you go there's the player
20:04 - spreadsheet and as you can see it has
20:06 - this body whereas previously we can see
20:08 - the original spreadsheet here is the
20:11 - original spreadsheet as you can see this
20:12 - body was replaced and it was replaced
20:16 - with this one in here this one so we
20:19 - just copy pasted these pixels onto the
20:21 - player spreadsheet check out the videos
20:23 - I've done on the gift spreadsheets as
20:25 - used in battle rata kun which explains
20:27 - how to read and copy pixels so you
20:29 - simply merge textures dynamically based
20:31 - on certain logic so in this case when he
20:33 - equips the special armor alright and
20:36 - just for the animated cutscene how that
20:39 - works here it is that he is handled in a
20:42 - different scene so in here we have the
20:44 - cinematic one which is the one where
20:46 - they in lose and here you can see how it
20:48 - is set up so it's very simple there's
20:50 - just an animation game object with a
20:52 - animation and over here we have the
20:55 - various poses of the characters and if
20:58 - we go into the animation we can play it
21:00 - and there you go first place through
21:02 - that one then that one shows up then
21:03 - that one shows up then down goes in
21:05 - there and that one goes in there and
21:06 - after a while there we go after seven
21:09 - seconds we then hold back into the over
21:10 - map so this is the cutscene where they
21:13 - lose and then the other cutscene where
21:15 - they win so here it is with a bunch more
21:17 - character poses and again the same thing
21:20 - just a game object with a animation and
21:23 - we play it and goes like that the player
21:25 - player defeats goes but then he defeats
21:28 - him and then he's on the floor and
21:30 - slizzer picks up the weapon and
21:33 - then he's standing around and sleazier
21:35 - stabs him in the back and there you go
21:37 - slizzer wins the day and yep there it is
21:41 - alright so that's pretty much it for our
21:43 - in-depth overview this was a very
21:46 - interesting game to make and I'm quite
21:48 - pleased with the end result it's a very
21:50 - nice simple old-school RPG you can get
21:53 - the project files yourself and try to
21:54 - expand upon it by making different maps
21:56 - and different story as you saw out the
21:58 - game is quite complex even though it was
22:00 - built in just two weeks the reason is
22:02 - because I was able to reuse quite a lot
22:04 - of code from previously made elements so
22:06 - as I only say make sure you always write
22:08 - clean code so you can reuse it in the
22:11 - future many thanks to easy on ice for
22:14 - setting up such a silly game gem and if
22:16 - you're interested in keeping up with
22:17 - gaming news and reviews go check them

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to check out a nice RPG I made in two weeks for a game jam it features an over map with enemies and NPCs a turnbased battle system and a nice small story with dialogue and cutscenes let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you will learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so first of all this game is an entry to the easy allies Glenys countering game jam you can play the game on itch and like every other video on the channel you can download the project files from the website I've been a big fan of easy allies since they were game trailers and I've been meaning to join a game jam for some time if you're not familiar with easy unless they are a group of awesome people who cover gaming news reviews and more so check out their YouTube channel so with this being such a unique and interesting game jam I thought it was time to give it a shot the uniqueness of the game jam was in making a game with a bunch of weird rooms designed to annoy the player for example one of the rules was to make character that randomly trips up the player another one is to have the characters constantly talk about mountain dew and have a very garish looking armor the end result of all that is a nice small RPG with a turnbased battle system with various characters and enemies the game is actually quite complex and the reason I've been able to make it in such a short amount of time is due to what I always talk about the videos which is the importance of writing clean reusable code as I go through an overview of how the game was made you won't see many elements which were created previously and simply added on to this game so if you've been following the channel for some time you might recognize various elements let's start off by going through part of the game and then we'll go more indepth into how each system works if you like you can pause the video right now and go play the game then come back here to continue watching the game is rather quick only around 20 minutes so go play it right now so the video doesn't spoil anything alright let's get to it we start off in a rather simple main menu here we just have gotten to play and want to quit as we hit play we can see the recipe which are the weird rules that the game must abide by so as you can see we have an extremely annoying sidekick then the button to taunt the NPC's is the same as the used consumable the player has a different sprite in the portrait the enemy wins in a cutscene and so on okay so continue here are the controls very simple movement and interaction now here we are in the game itself and we start the story we have a simple dialogue system with some text writing once the intro text is done then here we are in the over map so here we can move around very simple movement and we keep moving in counter our first enemy we talk to him and after a while we go into our battle screen so here we are in a very simple turnbased battle system I've actually covered this in a separate video last week now we can do our simple attack there he goes attacks once it's done it's the enemy's turn and he does his own attack and in this case he missed so we can keep attack him and destroy him we go back into the Oval map and the enemy has been destroyed keep going and we go into another fight now here we are and on this battle system we also have a special move the special differs per characters so our three different classes have three different special attacks this one is a powerful kick so president boom there he goes then when it's done it's on a cooldown so we now do our normal attacks to defeat town right there it is another one now we keep going and eventually you find our character which is blocking our passage first he starts off as an enemy so we need to defeat them and now we won and now he joins our team as he joins his annoying sidekick comes along with us so just like now we now have another member in our party now sleazier again one of the rules is to trip me up and yep he does it right away so I cannot move and that is indeed quite annoying so we keep going into this nice map and as we reach the town we have to go and talk to this NPC which is the other room where another NPC just randomly has the exact same sprite as the player and it is never explained then we keep going and go into a nice simple tavern and over here we get ambushed by enemies there you go some nice particle effects and yep we go into another battle so now we have two members in our team against three enemies so I can do a normal attack with this one and now on the tank character it has a different special so we hit it if there you go a nice AoE attack any of we win when we win then the humor which is the final character joins our party alright so this is the basics for how the game goes we move around the map we talk to NPCs from a story and pattern in a turnbased battle system so this is a fully functional simple RPG that was built in two weeks and you can go to edge to play the whole game and also you can download the project files from the website so you can see how all of this is set up so now that we've seen an overview let's see how each system is set up and what systems I've managed to reuse starting with the main menu here it is very simple we just have some buttons to play and quit and a bunch of extra buttons with information on the side the way the transitions are made is essentially with different selves so we start off with the south main then we hit play then we go into the recipe play so this one shows then we go into the controls and then we go into the game so here we are in the main menu hit play and there we go and the text is animated and pops up over time and we hit play and here it is just a simple thing and hit play okay so here we are in our game scene we start off with some story exposition so in here I've made this simple dialogue system it is very simple it only has two of all characters and text being written right now there's only one character talking so the right one is hidden so we can pause in order to go up here in turn look at our UI and here it is the download window and how it's set up so we have left character than the right character which is currently hidden live chat bubble right left name and right name this is a very simple dialogue system but the game is meant to be extremely simple so it's perfect for this scenario so let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a video dedicated to building a dialogue system now one of the rules is for the player sprite to be different in the portrait and in the over map so that's why the player has that sprite and in here the portrait is different once we get through the starting story here it is our main character the movement code was made in the simple character movement video so I can move them around with a keyboard but it would also be possible to use gamepad input now over here we have some hitboxes so if I go in there I cannot leave the map so the player is constrained to the plane area and if we pause we can see how the map is set up so here it is the entire game these game objects are what defines the various events that happened over the course of the game so as you can see in here the player start up in here this starts off the first enemy that has a specific text then the second one and then the tank gets spawned in here this laser and so on so as we move you can see everything is set up the map is on inside a nice game object where we have the visuals and also our hit boxes so there yo these are all the hitboxes so here for exemple you can see there's an invisible head box here to make sure that the player correctly interacts with this enemy before going through when he defeats this enemy then this head box won't become disabled so the player can keep moving and so on and so on so in here the same thing this one is blocked then it defeats the tank then the sprite and the hitbox both get vanished and as you can see on the entire map it's pretty simple since this is a very simple game jam game so we simply have this path so the player goes here goes here then keeps moving fight the evil monster get stuck in the dungeon moves towards evil monster it was back in the dungeon then this head box disappears then he moves through into the third evil monster encounter for the enemies you can see that they have some very roaming behavior so there he is stopped and after a while he simply moves to a position nearby his spawn position and all the NPCs are simply I don't just stand or decode for the enemy overlap is also very simple since all the combat is done on a separate scene the code in here similar looks to see if the player is nearby and moved towards him so in here if the player is within a certain target range then he moves towards him and if he is within a attack range then we have our interaction which then depending on this character type you won't either unload the starting cutscenes article simply unload an enemy encounter okay so let's approach our first enemy here we are let's move to the right and there's the enemy right there he sees me moves towards and engages the cutscene now you can see that dialogue is between two characters so here's the dialogue window and as you can see the left character is now slightly faded which only means this one is on gray now we keep talking and there you go some nice text writer on the text along with some sound and after a while here we go we go into our battle now I've covered the creation of this turnbased battle system in the last video so go check that out to see how it was made here this one has a couple more features unlike for example multiple targets and special attacks but the basics are do a normal attack there you go attacks now it's his turn now he goes attacks and so on right so once we defeat him we go back into our over map and the enemy was killed so he no longer gets spawned when you go back into the over map well let's go into another battle just so we can take some damage okay so here we are we took some damage and now we need to go back into the over map there you go our health matches so the healthcare is between battle to battle how that is set up is by using a simple character class and let's see how its set up here it is the character class over here we have a type for each unique type then we also have some basic stats and down here on our constructor we receive a type and based on that type we initialize these stats so here the player starts off with 35 attack 120 health and so on gaming Senshi AIT's a character when the game starts and keeps them in memory throughout the game that memory stored here in a game data class we have the various states that handle the story state and all the characters are stored in a simple list so they had initialized just once and there you go everything is like that for adding them here it is manually adding all the important characters so the player tanks laser in the healer and then it cycles through the map which is the map prefab that you saw previously and we insensate the characters that means in order to edit the map all we need to do is go in here and modify our prefab so in here I could have mana mean here by simply duplicating that game object and having it in there the data that is used to instantiate the character is stored in this simple model behavior so it is the position of the game object and then these stats to make sure which character it should be spawned so that's pretty much how the world design works just a bunch of game objects that define positions and what character type should be on that position okay now let's continue with the game now after fighting the first two we reach the tank blocking the tower entrance now there are four types of characters on the / map there's the player then there's the enemies then we have NPCs and farmers right now the tank is an NPC so he's just standing around and not doing anything by being near an NPC and pressing the interact but I can start a cutscene the cutscene that gets started depends on the game state so the aim state is stored in here on the game data as you can see we have just a very simple state variable and we leave various states so we do a switch and if we were interacting with an NPC and we are on a certain state then we start a certain cutting okay so over here we talk to the tank very simple and again here we are back in our battle scene with a different enemy type and over here I can now use a special for a very powerful kick now he attacks he does his normal attack and now normal time okay so just like this now I've defeated the tank and we go back into the over map and again it is the state to load the correct cutscene and over here we talked some like this name and go back to the over most so here we are back in the over map and slizzer immediately does his own thing now the tank is a forward instead of an NPC so that means he keeps track of the distance to the player and if it's far enough he moves towards him and that's it sneezer has a timer on his script and after a certain amount of time there you go he runs towards a player as soon as he gets within a certain distance the player trips up plays a small animation and can no longer move until it gets back up and everything proceeds so you see we also have various chat bombs being popped up these ones related to the fountain view are simple prefabs so they simply get in Senshi ated they are static prefabs in order to be able to have an image in the middle of the text whereas the other ones where this laser says and he replies those are dynamic chat bubbles meaning that the background extends based on the text so those are very similar to how the tone tip works okay continuing in the game we also have a nice quest arrow pointer this was also created in a previous video you saw previously pointing towards the tank with an exclamation mark and right now it's pointing there to the right and if we approach there go the position turns into 1x and when we get within a certain distance of our target there you go we unload another cutscene when we finish this cutscene there you go it's now pointing into a different direction and with a different color and as soon as we go there you go we nice exclamation point again check out the dedicated video to see how that works it's a very simple element now this character here is the one that is the examine like the player but never acknowledged so we talked to him and now we go towards the tavern and over here we have a bunch of NPCs just playing a simple iPhone animation over here is a healer which is currently just an NPC so he's not doing anything and when we approach this position it won't load another cutscene where the enemies won't ambushers now how that is set up we can see over here pause and go over here and here they are they get spawned right here in this corner so they're essentially just out of view and when we start the cutscene we won't play some nice particle effects and then they won't be teleported on to their correct positions so let's see that in action here we go start each cutscene all right now see the particle effects and now those characters get teleported in there as you can see they are no longer on the court okay so now is a good time to look at how the cutscenes are set up over here is a nice static classic contains all the cutscenes so down here we can go to the tavern ambush here is the tavern ambush cutscene so in this case we start off by destroying the pointer then we show the UI a black background we stop the over map from running so on the enemy stop roaming then we set the dialogue actions the dialogue is very simple so it only works linearly so essentially every action follows another one so we set those actions then we go into the very first one where we show the dialogue window then Sheldon left character with this pride show the unlife character name left text hide the right character right tags right name then when we go into the cutscene for the enemy spawning here it is we get the player position then we position the enemies in sin she ate some smoke particles and then we hide them so they are hidden while see smoke animation is playing and after a short amount of time they become visible all the timing is handled in here by the function timer which is a class from the code monkey utilities that you can get from the website then we keep going through our dialogue the enemy says his text and then we load our enemy encounter so all the cutscenes in the game are handled by this class so as you can see all of them play thanked after join play tank before join and so on we have all them ok so back into our game let's go through the dialogue and into battle and here as you can see we have multiple enemies and also the tank is now on our team so can select target and let's hit that one up there and now again the special attack is different so we can now try out the tank special attack and there you a nice AoE effect ok let's defeat them and here we are now we meet the human so now with all the team members in our party we can carry on with our quest well as soon as sleazier wants me go so let's wait if there is he is indeed very annoying okay so keep going and we're going to go into our shopkeeper and talk to him and there you go a very simple dialogue and when it's done we have the simplest basic shop possible and here we just have a very basic UI window here it is a UI window with just a few buttons Garen button is disabled and the others add points to either our health or our found you amount so just click on it and there you go our in your goes up and the store goes out of stock and so on now these ends are stored over here on the game data we just have two very simple ends okay so we keep going with the game and I last thing that I want to show is the animated cutscenes so here we are fighting the evil monster for the first time now the rules say that the monster should somehow we reckon Slee win the fight even though we kill me so we get them down to zero HP ok let's see if he dies on this hips and there we go as soon as he dies plays the animated cutscene and here we go he goes any spawns from behind any punches to play so just like that he miraculously won even though we actually destroyed and when we're done again based on our game state we now we had teleport into the dungeon and we start in here so here we meet the other character and after talking to him for a while he decides to untie us and there you go just simple movement and destroying the rope game objects before continuing on with down there we go the same particle effect he vanishes and here we are back into the cutscene so that's pretty much it for all of the unique elements of the game so again if we pause we can see the entire path of the game so we are right here in the dungeon so now the goal is to go in here meet the evil monster for the second time and we're going to lose again then we go back here then this package gets destroyed and we can then go and find the third battle where we can finally win let's just go over here to the second chair which has a fun new armor and that is again here on the character Spandana simply a bone has found your armor so when this shopkeeper is spawn he has the armor so let's meet him and also else in the over map we can press base in order to use one of the health potions and we heal everyone on the team ok so here we are talk to him and he has the armor available so click on it and there you go we equip the armor and there it is it replaced our previous body so now the player is wearing the special armor now the way this works is by replacing pixels on the players spreadsheet so in here we can pause look at the player spreadsheet and there you go there's the player spreadsheet and as you can see it has this body whereas previously we can see the original spreadsheet here is the original spreadsheet as you can see this body was replaced and it was replaced with this one in here this one so we just copy pasted these pixels onto the player spreadsheet check out the videos I've done on the gift spreadsheets as used in battle rata kun which explains how to read and copy pixels so you simply merge textures dynamically based on certain logic so in this case when he equips the special armor alright and just for the animated cutscene how that works here it is that he is handled in a different scene so in here we have the cinematic one which is the one where they in lose and here you can see how it is set up so it's very simple there's just an animation game object with a animation and over here we have the various poses of the characters and if we go into the animation we can play it and there you go first place through that one then that one shows up then that one shows up then down goes in there and that one goes in there and after a while there we go after seven seconds we then hold back into the over map so this is the cutscene where they lose and then the other cutscene where they win so here it is with a bunch more character poses and again the same thing just a game object with a animation and we play it and goes like that the player player defeats goes but then he defeats him and then he's on the floor and slizzer picks up the weapon and then he's standing around and sleazier stabs him in the back and there you go slizzer wins the day and yep there it is alright so that's pretty much it for our indepth overview this was a very interesting game to make and I'm quite pleased with the end result it's a very nice simple oldschool RPG you can get the project files yourself and try to expand upon it by making different maps and different story as you saw out the game is quite complex even though it was built in just two weeks the reason is because I was able to reuse quite a lot of code from previously made elements so as I only say make sure you always write clean code so you can reuse it in the future many thanks to easy on ice for setting up such a silly game gem and if you're interested in keeping up with gaming news and reviews go check them out on YouTube as always you can download the project files in the Tonys from unity code monkey comp if you like the videos certain channel for more Eng tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll do my best Internet right see
