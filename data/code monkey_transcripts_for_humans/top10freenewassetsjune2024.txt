01:16 - really nice visual effect this one takes
01:17 - your game and rends it in aski it makes
01:20 - for a really interesting visual effect
01:21 - you can customize the characters or the
01:23 - color palan to get a unique look exactly
01:25 - what you're going for this certainly
01:27 - makes your game stand out you can
01:28 - customize it in many ways and even

01:38 - it stand out then if you need some
01:39 - volumetric fog here is a nice free
01:41 - package volumetric in case you don't
01:43 - know means that the fog has an external
01:45 - shape so you can see the fog peeking
01:47 - through all the objects in your scene
01:48 - this is one of those effects that really
01:50 - helps even just a basic scene look much
01:52 - better you can customize the intensity
01:54 - or the various parameters for the ray
01:55 - marching algorithm the results really
01:57 - look really nice so perhaps try it out
01:59 - for your next prototype then if you need

02:14 - if you're tired of your duplicate
02:16 - objects having a strange format check
02:17 - out this symbol tool it helps you rename
02:19 - a list of Game objects with whatever
02:21 - suffix or prefix you want it's a pre
02:23 - symol tool that can be quite useful if
02:25 - you duplicate objects all the time and
02:27 - you don't like the default naming scheme
02:29 - which by the way actually in recent
02:30 - Unity versions you can modify that
02:32 - inside of unity itself you can tell it
02:34 - to use the number in parentheses or
02:36 - after the underscore and so on although
02:38 - this tool does have some extra options
02:40 - and you can also rename objects after
02:42 - being created next every game needs to
02:44 - have some kind of settings menu so if
02:45 - you want to tool to help you easily
02:47 - create a settings menu then look at this
02:49 - one in just a few minutes you can create
02:50 - a fully functioning settings menu with
02:52 - all the settings you want and whatever
02:54 - visual you want it includes support for
02:56 - menu navigation with either keyboard or
02:57 - game pad so all the arrows all
02:59 - directions those are already set up by

03:03 - manager or the input system and it even
03:05 - works in both un UI and UI tokit all in

03:16 - this modern vehicle pack you've got
03:18 - planes helicopters and apcs they come
03:20 - with some realistic textures but you
03:22 - could also make them styliz for example
03:24 - you could get a red texture for one
03:25 - faction and a blue texture for another
03:27 - one so you could definitely use this as
03:28 - a starting point to make a classic RTS
03:30 - you can just pick up this pack and
03:32 - quickly get started and by the way I'm
03:33 - actually in the process of making a

04:11 - camera in some kind of CCTV game next
04:14 - here's another super nice simple tool
04:16 - that does just one thing and does it
04:17 - very well when you make a new build it
04:19 - automatically increments the build
