02:16 - built by racing fans for racing fans

02:21 - disciplines everything from rallycross
02:24 - gt racing super trucks euro trucks and
02:26 - much more it features tire degradation
02:29 - fuel consumption and damage so the game
02:31 - also has a nice amount of pit stop
02:33 - strategy
02:34 - includes online multiplayer and lots of
02:36 - game modes you can even go into your
02:38 - garage and customize your cars in driver

02:55 - characters but i do know they're very
02:57 - popular it's a character brawler very
02:59 - much like smash bros that's pretty much
03:02 - the main selling point a very well made

03:08 - it's got quite a lot of content with
03:09 - plenty of maps and characters features
03:11 - online as well as local multiplayer
03:13 - which is pretty rare nowadays it's
03:15 - always great to see a big release with
03:17 - some big-ip choosing to go with yinti
03:20 - already has over 3000 very positive
03:22 - reviews so unlike most licensed games

03:30 - thing but it really does help thanks and
03:32 - up next for some vr check out eye of the
03:34 - temple it's an adventure game definitely
03:37 - inspired by indiana jones
03:39 - go inside this ancient temple and

03:42 - your feet
03:44 - keep your balance as you move from one
03:45 - block to the next dodge traps solve
03:47 - puzzles and play around with your fully
03:50 - physically simulated whip this is one of
03:52 - those games that was built from the
03:53 - ground up specifically for vr so it's an
03:56 - example of an experience that is very
03:57 - much vr only and if you want to take it
04:00 - to the next level there's even a speed
04:01 - running mode
04:02 - so if you want to try pushing your body

04:24 - abilities to master engage in turn-based
04:26 - tactical combat and experience a massive
04:28 - campaign it has over 5000 very positive
04:31 - reviews so this is an example of a very
04:33 - successful early access development
04:35 - where they develop the game alongside
04:37 - the community and final game is
04:39 - excellent then for something a bit more
04:41 - calm here is the last campfire
04:43 - this one is actually made by hello games
04:45 - so the developers behind no man's sky
04:48 - it's very different from that game this
04:50 - one is a puzzle adventure game it's got
04:52 - a very cute art style great characters
04:55 - and great creatures all in a very
04:56 - mysterious world you'll receive lots of
04:59 - nines and tens and reviews so if you're
05:01 - interested in this genre definitely give
05:02 - it a look then here is rebel inc
05:05 - escalation this one is by the same
05:07 - developers that made the excellent play
05:09 - gank it's got some similar mechanics to
05:11 - that one except instead of controlling a
05:13 - virus you're actually trying to
05:15 - stabilize a warden torrent country so
05:17 - you're trying to win the hearts and
05:18 - minds of the people while also stopping
05:20 - a deadly insurgency
05:22 - you expand your government military and
05:24 - civilian services capture and secure
05:26 - areas in order to bring peace and
05:28 - stability to the country features a
05:30 - campaign mode as well as co-op and
05:32 - versus multiplayer this one also just
05:34 - came out of early access so it's got a
05:36 - massive amount of content especially for
05:37 - this price if you like plague inc or you
05:40 - like strategy simulation games then
05:42 - you'll probably like this one and yet
05:44 - another one that graduated after a long
05:46 - time in early access lots of these ones
05:48 - this month this one is legion td2 it's
05:52 - an infinitely replayable multiplayer and
05:54 - single player tower defense game based
05:57 - on the 5 000 very positive reviews it
05:59 - seems like if you're looking for a tower
06:01 - defense game then this one is one of the
06:03 - best build your own custom army choose
06:05 - from 8 unique factions and over 100
06:08 - fighters choose your playstyle play
06:10 - offensively and smash your opponents or
06:12 - maybe focus on the economy to become a
06:14 - juggernaut in late game
06:16 - it's even got an illo ranking system so
06:18 - if you want to take your tower defense
06:19 - skills to the next level then give this
06:21 - a try and finally for my personal pick
06:23 - of the month here's a really interesting
06:25 - city builder called infraspace
06:28 - the main thing about this one is that
06:29 - it's so focused on efficiently
06:31 - transporting resources which is exactly
06:33 - the kind of thing that i love to do it
06:35 - looks like it has a very complex
06:37 - building system lots of roads going over
06:39 - each other with all kinds of twists and
06:40 - turns you start off in an empty planet
06:43 - but you cannot just eat credits so you
06:45 - start gathering some raw materials then
06:47 - transport them into factories in order
06:49 - to be processed and finally to the
06:50 - habitats in order to be consumed set up
06:52 - your food and oxygen logistics routes
06:55 - and make sure those supply chains are
06:57 - not disrupting keep gathering more and
06:59 - more resources grow your population and
07:01 - build the perfect utopia it just came
07:04 - out in early access but has already
07:05 - received several updates i haven't
