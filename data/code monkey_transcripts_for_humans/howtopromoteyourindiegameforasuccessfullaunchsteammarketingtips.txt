00:00 - as to how you can promote your indie
00:02 - game there are many ways to do marketing
00:03 - the most basic prerequisite is simply
00:06 - having a public steam page the most
00:08 - impactful thing in marketing is simply
00:10 - time the quicker you get your steam page
00:12 - up and running the more time you have to
00:14 - gather wishlist
00:15 - lists build up over time so the longer
00:17 - you have your page receiving wishlist
00:19 - the better
00:20 - then like i mentioned a while ago one of
00:21 - the main ones is youtube if you have the
00:24 - right kind of personality you can
00:25 - attempt the danny style with lots of
00:27 - funny clips and some extreme editing as
00:29 - for me i definitely do not have that
00:31 - kind of personality so that type of
00:33 - content would definitely not work for me
00:35 - but you can also do some more chill
00:37 - devlogs i made a video quite a while ago
00:39 - covering a bunch of devlogs like i
00:41 - mentioned themed matrix is a good one
00:44 - you also have flow studio that recently
00:46 - released a successful game
00:48 - you have lumber mill and devdog and many
00:50 - more
00:51 - feel free to check those out to see what
00:52 - style best fits you in your game
00:55 - also it doesn't have to be just devlogs
00:57 - maybe if you have a sandbox game you
00:59 - could make a channel with some funny
01:01 - clips or some weird unexpected things
01:03 - that happen in your game remember that
01:05 - the goal is attention so do whatever you
01:07 - can do that brings in the most intention
01:09 - another place you can do some marketing
01:11 - would be on twitter
01:12 - although in terms of results i believe
01:14 - this one is quite limited but still you
01:16 - should be making some gifts and perhaps
01:18 - one of them won't go viral
01:20 - then as you're making those gifts you
01:21 - can also post them on imager
01:23 - i think this one also has kind of lost
01:25 - its power nowadays but you might get
01:27 - lucky and make it go viral then of
01:29 - course you have reddit depending on what
01:32 - game you're making you can find a
01:33 - subreddit specific for the audience
01:35 - you're looking for
01:36 - for example there's a tycoon subreddit
01:39 - there's one for tournament-based
01:40 - strategy or maybe you can even post in
01:42 - subreddits of other popular games
01:44 - similar to yours
01:45 - but do be careful with red rules some
01:48 - server edits are very strict about
01:50 - self-promotion there's also tick-tock
01:53 - personally i have not explored this one
01:54 - yet i'm not familiar with it but i did
01:57 - hear some indies are finding quite a lot
01:58 - of success
01:59 - then a tried and true method you have a
02:02 - mailing list just have a signup form on
02:04 - your website mention it whenever you
02:06 - mention your game and keep growing that
02:08 - list usually people who sign up to a
02:10 - mailing list are already pre-interested
02:12 - so growing this one is very difficult
02:14 - but very powerful another technique a
02:16 - lot of people have used successfully is
02:18 - making a free prologue
02:20 - so kind of like making a free demo if
02:22 - you design the demo correctly and it
02:24 - leaves people wanting more then you will
02:26 - likely gather a nice amount of wishlist
02:28 - and related to that free prologue
02:30 - something more recent are the steam
02:31 - festivals i believe they have some rules
02:34 - on when you can submit but if you can
02:36 - definitely take advantage of it for
02:38 - example the game i mentioned a while ago
02:40 - lens island by floyd studio they
02:42 - benefited massively from participating
02:43 - in this team festival
02:45 - it's great for gathering tons and tons
02:47 - of wishlists even if those then convert
02:49 - less than the organic questions and of
02:51 - course you also have paid marketing this
02:53 - one will naturally depend on the funds
02:55 - you have available as well as the price
02:57 - of your game
02:58 - if you have a very cheap five dollar
03:00 - game it's pretty difficult to make paid
03:02 - marketing work but if your game is 15 or
03:05 - 20 dollars then at that point it becomes
03:07 - much more doable so those are just a
03:10 - bunch of ways you can do some marketing
03:12 - you might be thinking to yourself okay
03:13 - that sounds good but it's way too much
03:15 - work so again let me remind you that the
03:17 - alternative to doing no marketing is
03:19 - getting no sales
03:21 - so either you put in the work or you
03:23 - have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a
03:25 - reality whether you like it or not
