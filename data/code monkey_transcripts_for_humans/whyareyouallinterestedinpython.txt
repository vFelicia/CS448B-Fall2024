00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a bit of a weird question why
00:04 - are you all interested in python a while
00:06 - ago youtube added an extra tool to the
00:08 - analytics it basically lets me see what
00:10 - my audience which is all of you what all
00:12 - of you are searching for and of course
00:14 - everything that you expect is over here
00:16 - so there's tons of queries about c sharp
00:17 - how to make a game looking for devlogs
00:19 - some more c sharp and so on then there's
00:22 - a bunch about unreal and sometimes
00:23 - someone godot
00:25 - and yet there's also usually over here
00:27 - at the top there's always python this
00:30 - list changes i think it's every day some
00:32 - of these terms come and go like for
00:34 - example godown and real sometimes they
00:35 - go down into page 2 and 3 and so on
00:38 - however at the top right here it's
00:39 - always python so my question to you is
00:42 - why is that
00:43 - these are viewer searches so this is
00:45 - because all of you are searching for
00:46 - this now in terms of game development
00:48 - i've really only used python when doing
00:50 - some machine learning with unity ml
00:51 - agents and even then it was just running
00:54 - some preset commands so there's no need
00:56 - to actually know python or write any
00:58 - python code perhaps it's because people
01:00 - start learning programming with python
01:02 - and when learning programming they try
01:04 - to make a game with python
01:05 - maybe that's part of it when i first
01:07 - started learning programming about 20
01:09 - years ago python was indeed recommended
01:11 - as one of the easiest languages to learn
01:13 - i didn't learn the basics of it i used
01:15 - it quite a lot when a couple of years
01:16 - ago i was playing around with raspberry
01:18 - pi's and arduinos but i never really
01:20 - used it for anything game related i have
01:22 - heard about pygame which appears to be a
01:24 - pretty interesting framework if you want
01:26 - to make games with python and over here
01:28 - on the searches sometimes my game does
01:29 - show up so i guess maybe if you already
01:31 - know python then it can be easier to
01:33 - start making games with that as opposed
01:35 - to jumping straight into unity or in
01:36 - real and having to learn a completely
01:38 - new language if i go into the ntsor and
01:41 - i search for python
01:43 - then the main thing that shows up is
01:45 - obviously just a whole bunch of snakes
01:47 - and the only python tools over here u
01:49 - python
01:50 - this is apparently a tool which lets you
01:52 - run python code and interact with it
01:54 - from unity
01:55 - i guess this could be interesting if
01:56 - there are some specific python tools
01:58 - that can be useful so anyways i'm just
02:00 - curious
02:02 - if you watch this channel and you're
02:03 - also interested in python and you're
02:05 - used to searching for it then let me
02:06 - know why and what it is you're doing
02:08 - with it perhaps python can do some
02:10 - really interesting things combined with
02:11 - unity that i just don't know about
02:13 - so do let me know in the comments
02:16 - thanks to these awesome patreon
02:17 - supporters for making these videos
02:18 - possible thank you for watching and i'll
02:21 - see you next time
02:29 - [Music]
