00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - min this video we're going to view a
00:03 - summary of the series modular
00:04 - spreadsheets as used for guests in
00:06 - barrel around tycoon let's begin
00:10 - so the goal in this series is to create
00:13 - a modular spreadsheet so we can have
00:15 - near infinite variations this technique
00:17 - is used in banaram Tycoon for making
00:19 - each guest look unique in the end we
00:21 - won't have a very unique guest as well
00:23 - as the ability to save and load the same
00:25 - spreadsheet in the first video we're
00:27 - going to see how the base fried sheet is
00:28 - setup where each body part goes and how
00:31 - they're used we're going to learn how to
00:33 - read a texture in code and copy pixels
00:36 - in doing so we're going to do a simple
00:38 - composition of the final spreadsheet by
00:41 - selecting several personal heads and
00:43 - bodies then with the knowledge of simple
00:45 - copy/paste of pixels we won't compose
00:47 - the head sprite from various hair and
00:49 - beards so we won't have a texture with
00:51 - just an empty head along with a texture
00:53 - containing multiple beards and another
00:55 - one with various hairstyles through code
00:57 - we will pick a random beard and random
01:00 - hair sound and compose all three
01:01 - elements into the final spreadsheet with
01:04 - that we will then look into Harriton
01:06 - individual pixels we will learn how we
01:08 - can get multiple hair colors by using a
01:10 - base white texture and tinting it with a
01:13 - specific color that way we add a lot
01:15 - more variation while still using the
01:17 - same base beard and hair styles then
01:19 - using the same strategy we will modify
01:21 - the skin color so taking a white texture
01:24 - of the face we will apply a tint however
01:27 - we do not want to tend the eye so we
01:29 - will learn how to apply a tint but only
01:31 - went inside a mask texture after that we
01:34 - won't take what we learn to apply a
01:35 - primary and secondary body color
01:37 - we will then set up the base body
01:39 - texture to have some preset colored
01:41 - parts and some white parts that won't be
01:43 - tinted then we will use a mask texture
01:46 - which won't contain the information for
01:48 - where to apply the primary and secondary
01:50 - colors so with all of those parameters
01:52 - we will have pretty much infinite amount
01:54 - of variation for our guest sprites the
01:57 - last thing we'll need is some way to
01:59 - save and load so we won't create a class
02:02 - to hold all the various parameters that
02:03 - make up a specific spreadsheet like the
02:06 - hair index and skin color then we will
02:08 - use Jason as our simple file format to
02:11 - save and load the exact same spreadsheet
02:12 - every time so that's the plan for the
02:15 - modular spreadsheet series you can pick
02:17 - up the game on seam to see the guest
02:19 - variation in action this series will
02:21 - teach you all you need to know to
02:23 - textures with code so you can compose
02:25 - your own spreadsheets in any way you
02:27 - want so go watch the playlist and begin
02:29 - learning right now as always you can
02:31 - download the project files inventories
02:33 - for each video in the series from unity
02:35 - code monkey comm if you have any
02:37 - questions post them in the comments and
02:38 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
02:40 - for more videos and I'll see you next
02:42 - time
02:51 - you
