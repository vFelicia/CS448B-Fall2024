00:34 - off on not just one but actually two
00:36 - unity mega bundles these are full of
00:38 - awesome assets first on the daring mega
00:40 - bundle you have some adorable items and
00:43 - a massive cartoony ui pack
00:45 - then a fluid simulation some rocky hills
00:47 - and a ton of spell icons and on the last
00:50 - year make your characters more natural
00:52 - with a leaning animator tons of tools to
00:54 - help you make mobile games some spells
00:56 - awesome effects and tons more the second
00:58 - bundle has a mech constructor asset
01:00 - some force fields and cartoon monsters
01:03 - then you've got some melee and pistol
01:04 - animations water system a turn-based rpg
01:07 - template and lots more there's tons of
01:09 - variety in both bundles and with such a
01:11 - deep discount if just one of these
01:13 - assets looks interesting then the home
01:14 - bundle is worth it check out both
01:16 - bundles with the links in the
01:17 - description alright so starting off with
01:19 - this ragdoll animator it lets you
01:22 - simultaneously use ragdolls and
01:24 - animations at the same time you just
01:26 - select your character and easily set up
01:27 - the rectangle then with a bunch of
01:29 - sliders you can control the muscle power
01:32 - so for example if your player gets hit
01:33 - with a really strong punch you can
01:35 - disable on the muscles and let the
01:36 - player fall down with the ragdoll and
01:38 - then you slowly increasing muscle power
01:40 - as you play the get up animation i've
01:42 - only briefly used ragdolls but combining
01:45 - them with animations is definitely
01:46 - tricky so this asset looks super useful
01:49 - it's also made by an experienced
01:50 - developer with tons of tools already on
01:52 - the store so you know this one is a
01:54 - stable well-built asset then here's a
01:56 - really fun one you can easily create
01:58 - your own trees directly inside unity it
02:01 - uses splines so you can make whatever
02:03 - shape you want so you can make the trunk
02:05 - perfectly straight or something a bit
02:07 - more exotic with some loops for the
02:09 - leaves you also have tons of options
02:10 - using sine distance fields you can
02:12 - define the shape size and how many
02:14 - leaves as well as changing the density
02:16 - this one is definitely a very unique
02:18 - tool but maybe instead of buying some
02:20 - packs with some prevail trees you can
02:21 - simply pick this one up and bum them
02:23 - yourself or maybe this is perfect if
02:25 - you're going for something with some
02:26 - really unnatural wacky trees and up next
02:29 - here's another really interesting and
02:31 - unique tool this one lets you build all
02:33 - kinds of graphs and charts everything
02:35 - from simple line graphs to some bar
02:37 - charts and pie charts it's packed with
02:40 - tons of features for how to display your
02:41 - data and how to interact with it it even
02:44 - supports ar and vr which sounds like fun
02:47 - i actually made a full-length tutorial
02:49 - series on how to make a graph in unity i
02:51 - made it for my game battleground tycoon
02:53 - it took a massive amount of work and it
02:55 - was nowhere near as feature rich as this
02:57 - one so i can definitely see this package
02:59 - as a huge time saver then for something
03:01 - nice and simple here's one to easily
03:03 - make tons of icons
03:05 - right away i can see the ability to add
03:07 - post-processing can definitely be a huge
03:09 - time saver imagine using this to make
03:11 - some sort of achievement icons where
03:13 - usually you need an icon for achieved
03:15 - and one for unlocked you could just
03:17 - lower the saturation as a post-pressing
03:19 - effect and easily make the unlocked
03:20 - items or really just any in-game buttons
03:23 - or icons the setup seems really easy you
03:25 - just select the prefab and you can see a
03:27 - view of the icon in an editor window
03:30 - then you just rotate and move the object
03:32 - change the background apply any colors
03:34 - or anything you can even add some
03:35 - overlay images and easily save the image
03:37 - file and of course you can apply the
03:39 - exact same settings involved to make
03:41 - tons and tons of icons all at once very
03:43 - simple and very useful tool then here's
03:46 - another fun wacky one a stylized hair
03:48 - tool essentially you click to add a
03:51 - bunch of hair follicles then you grow
03:53 - the hair as much as you want with
03:55 - whatever thickness and color you want
03:57 - and the hair is also physically
03:59 - simulated so it bounces up and down you
04:01 - can change the weight stiffness and
04:02 - manually brush the hair definitely makes
04:04 - for a very unique look if your game has
04:06 - a stylized art sound then this asset
04:08 - might be excellent for making your game
04:10 - stand out any player that sees a bunch
04:12 - of these wacky hair physics will
04:14 - certainly keep paying attention then
04:16 - here's one that is an extremely useful
04:17 - tool for just the right type of person
04:20 - it's a floating origin tool if you have
04:22 - no idea what that means then chances are
04:24 - you've never tried making a really
04:25 - really huge game
04:27 - the unity world is based on floats and
04:29 - the bigger the value the less precise it
04:31 - becomes so if your game goes into the
04:33 - millions or billions in scale as you get
04:36 - further away from the origin you start
04:37 - to see some really weird behavior pretty
04:39 - much because the positions don't have
04:41 - enough precision
04:42 - what this asset does is it constantly
04:44 - moves the origin of the world so you're
04:46 - never too far away and never cause those
04:48 - issues this one is also specifically
04:50 - designed to solve this problem in
04:51 - multiplayer games using mirror and up
04:53 - next here's one that does something that
04:55 - i've always wanted as you know when you
04:57 - add a component to a game object you
04:59 - can't really pass any parameters you
05:01 - just have the component and then maybe
05:03 - you call some kind of setup function
05:05 - whereas with normal c-sharp every class
05:07 - has a constructor where you can pass in
05:09 - any parameters you want so what the sus
05:11 - does is it adds an initialization
05:13 - function to your scripts so you can
05:15 - easily add components and pass in
05:17 - arguments at the exact same time it's a
05:18 - really simple thing that is really very
05:20 - useful it also works with scriptamol
05:22 - objects so that could also be useful for
05:24 - making your own tools so this one is a
05:26 - simple one and does exactly what it's
05:28 - meant to do
05:29 - then here's another fun one called now
05:31 - we're talking it's a tool for easily
05:33 - adding mouth movements so your
05:35 - characters can actually tone
05:37 - the mouth is simplified so this is
05:39 - primarily meant for low poly acids which
05:41 - just so happens to be the style that i
05:42 - really like it's really quite amazing
05:44 - how just adding some simple mouth shapes
05:46 - and some blinging eyes really improves
05:48 - the feel of the game
05:49 - the setup also seems very simple you
05:51 - just find the face or mouth bone and
05:54 - just add the prefab that's pretty much
05:55 - it and up next here's an interesting
05:57 - texture tool this one is a tool for
06:00 - taking your textures and then baking
06:01 - them directly into the mesh so the final
06:04 - result looks exactly the same but it's
06:06 - using mesh data instead of separate
06:08 - textures so that's an interesting one
06:10 - one of the benefits seems to be memory
06:12 - since you don't need heavy textures also
06:14 - there is no need for baked light map
06:16 - data so that saves a ton on memory
06:19 - another benefit is making a blend map
06:21 - directly inside the vertex data you can
06:23 - also bake sky boxes and cube maps so
06:26 - this one is definitely an interesting
06:27 - unique tool and finally here's one that
06:29 - can be quite useful it's a
06:31 - collector-based object fade
06:33 - exactly like the name implies you can
06:35 - fade objects that the camera collides
06:37 - with if your player can freely move the
06:39 - camera then having a system like this is
06:41 - a must-have
06:42 - this one looks so much better than if
06:44 - the camera just goes inside the objects
06:46 - making them fade and look so much better
06:48 - so that's pretty much what this one does
06:49 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
06:52 - and systems on the ent assessor for
06:54 - january 2022 there's links to on the
06:56 - description and as a bonus you can use
06:58 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off
07:00 - your order check out the phone policy to
07:02 - see some more lists with free and paid
07:03 - assets and let me know if you pick up
07:05 - any of these and what you intend to do
07:06 - with them also check out my own free and
07:08 - paid assets on store
07:10 - alright hope that's useful check out
07:11 - these videos to learn some more thanks
07:13 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
07:15 - making these videos possible thank you
