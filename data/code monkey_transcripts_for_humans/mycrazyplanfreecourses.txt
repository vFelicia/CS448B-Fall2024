00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI and my C
00:02 - course is finally ready I've been
00:04 - working non-stop on this for months you
00:06 - might have noticed that I really haven't
00:07 - published many regular videos lately
00:09 - this is really why I'm very tired very
00:11 - stressed out but extremely happy with
00:13 - the final result I put all my knowledge
00:14 - all my 10 years of experience into this
00:16 - one course and I made some really
00:18 - interesting content to help you Tru and
00:19 - learn it has 56 step-by-step video
00:21 - lectures then there are 389 frequently
00:24 - asked questions to provide extra
00:26 - clarification on each lecture there's
00:28 - 358 multiple choice quizzes to put your
00:30 - knowledge of each lecture into the test
00:32 - and very importantly there are 83
00:34 - interactive exercises these require you
00:36 - to put into practice the contents of
00:37 - each lecture so you can actually truly
00:39 - learn this last one is really special
00:41 - you only truly learn by doing as opposed
00:42 - to just watching a video and all of
00:44 - these exercises were handcraft By Me In
00:46 - order to help you truly learn the
00:47 - contents of each lecture this course has
00:49 - all this as well as some other really
00:50 - nice bonus that I'm going to mention in
00:52 - a little bit honestly I'm really happy
00:53 - with this course this is basally the
00:55 - course that I wish I had 10 years ago
00:56 - when I started learning C if I had this
00:58 - back then I would have gained my
00:59 - knowledge much much faster so I really
01:01 - truly hope this helps you a lot in your
01:03 - Learning Journey at the same time right
01:05 - now there are only the first two
01:06 - sections the beginner and the
01:07 - intermediate one building all of this
01:09 - was a ton of work and I don't want to
01:11 - delay the launch since these two
01:12 - sections are ready right now but the
01:14 - goal is for this course to be a complete
01:16 - C course from absolute beginner to very
01:17 - Advanced I want this to be the ultimate
01:19 - C Mastery course so for the next month I
01:22 - will be working on the advaned section
01:23 - and it will eventually be coming out as
01:24 - a free update now for the topic in the
01:26 - title of this video personally I'm a big
01:28 - believer in education I think it's
01:30 - really awesome how nowadays as long as
01:32 - you have an internet connection you have
01:33 - the ability to learn literally anything
01:35 - and also think it's very important that
01:36 - there is high quality education
01:38 - available for free I don't think there's
01:40 - anything wrong with charging money for
01:41 - it but still if someone has desire to
01:42 - learn I want them to be able to learn
01:44 - whether they have money or not basically
01:46 - I picture myself when I was a kid and I
01:48 - went to learn flash but back then I had
01:50 - zero dollars back in my day there wasn't
01:52 - anything like YouTube or even any paid
01:53 - courses so for me I had to learn mostly
01:56 - by doing a ton of trial and error by
01:58 - reading some really dry documentation
02:00 - and just finding random posts on the
02:01 - internet it was definitely not a very
02:03 - efficient way to learn but really that
02:05 - was all I had at the time it took me
02:07 - years to learn what you cannot learn in
02:08 - a few months nowadays thankfully it's
02:10 - much much easier to learn and I really
02:12 - want to contribute to that that's the
02:13 - main purpose behind the whole Channel
02:15 - that's why I've made tons of free video
02:17 - tutorials sharing the knowledge that
02:18 - I've gained in the 10 years that I've
02:19 - been making my own games a year ago I
02:21 - did a really interesting experiment I
02:22 - made my free kitchen chaos course this
02:24 - one is a really awesome 10-hour course
02:26 - on making a complete game from scratch
02:28 - it is great for beginners and
02:29 - intermediate users then I also made the
02:31 - follow-up free multiplayer course both
02:33 - are really on the same level of quality
02:35 - as my paid courses and really the same
02:37 - level of quality as a code that I write
02:38 - in my own professional games and
02:40 - importantly I made those sces completely
02:41 - free with an optional paid version this
02:44 - was really an experiment and I had no
02:46 - idea what the result would be so would
02:48 - the video be a complete flop would I
02:49 - perhaps lose a ton of time and money or
02:52 - would it perhaps go viral and would
02:54 - there be enough people buying the
02:55 - optional paid version to at least let me
02:56 - recoup the costs thankfully I'm happy to
02:59 - report that things did turn out quite
03:00 - well there were indeed a handful of
03:02 - generous people who bought the optional
03:04 - paid version or gave some nice super
03:05 - thanks in the video or became YouTube or
03:07 - patreon members so because of all those
03:09 - people the course did manage to break
03:11 - even and make a little bit of money so
03:13 - really thanks to all of you who did that
03:15 - there were about 400 sales on the
03:17 - optional paid version and also thanks to
03:18 - the people watching and liking the video
03:20 - the video actually went pretty viral and
03:21 - got over 2 million views honestly if I
03:23 - could guarantee this level of success
03:25 - and I think I could make a bunch more
03:26 - free course without worrying about the
03:28 - result but I really don't think I can
03:30 - reliably expect the same results this
03:32 - video has 2 million views whereas most
03:33 - of my videos only get about 10 to 15,000
03:36 - and even just looking at difference in
03:37 - views between part one and part two
03:39 - clearly the first one had some massive
03:41 - outside success there was a certain Lu
03:43 - factor that I really don't think I can
03:45 - replicate so that's really the Dilemma
03:46 - that I've been thinking about for the
03:48 - past few months I'm really happy with
03:49 - the c course and I would love everyone
03:51 - to be able to learn from it but at the
03:53 - same time I also have to pay my own rent
03:55 - and one day I would love to have a more
03:56 - balanced work schedule something where I
03:58 - don't have to work non-stop 7 days a
04:00 - week so I can't really justify making it
04:01 - them for free but also really don't want
04:03 - to put it all behind the pay wall so
04:05 - here's the plan that I come up something
04:07 - that is kind of in between to both make
04:09 - it free and make it sustainable without
04:10 - relying on the luck of the YouTube
04:12 - algorithm next week I will publish the
04:14 - first free video here on YouTube with
04:15 - the complete beginner section so all 23
04:17 - of those video lectures then hopefully
04:19 - the course will sell 100 copies of the
04:21 - premium version and one month after the
04:23 - first video if it's above that threshold
04:25 - I will publish the intermediate section
04:27 - for free and then hopefully sell 100
04:29 - copies more and finally one month after
04:31 - that I will publish the advance section
04:32 - for free here on YouTube basally I'm
04:34 - betting that there are at least 200
04:36 - people in the audience of this channel
04:37 - who have some good high paying jobs and
04:39 - can't afford to buy the premium version
04:41 - in doing so those people will get some
04:42 - really nice bonuses for the premium
04:44 - version while also allowing others to
04:45 - watch a video lecture for free since the
04:47 - kitchen cow course hold about 400 copies
04:49 - I'm hoping this one can sell about 200
04:51 - without the video having to go viral if
04:53 - this plan works and I think that's the
04:54 - best scenario for everyone people who
04:56 - can afford it can buy the premium
04:57 - version and watch all the lectures right
04:59 - now with all of the extra awesome
05:00 - bonuses and people who can't afford it
05:02 - they can watch a beginner video lecture
05:03 - for free next week and hopefully all the
05:05 - other free sections in the coming months
05:07 - and I myself can make enough money
05:08 - without having to put everything behind
05:10 - the pay wall like most courses if the
05:12 - plan doesn't work out then this course
05:13 - really just ends up like many other
05:15 - course that exists where there's just a
05:17 - small free sample and most of it behind
05:18 - a pay wall but I really hope it does
05:20 - work in doing my research for this
05:22 - course I did find a bunch of free course
05:23 - on YouTube although they really only
05:25 - ever cover the basics if you have no
05:27 - money and you want to learn more
05:28 - intermediate or advanced topics and you
05:30 - really have no option so kind of like
05:31 - myself when I was a kid that is why I
05:33 - came up with this plan to hopefully get
05:35 - a free course that anyone can learn that
05:36 - covers beginner intermediate and
05:37 - advanced topics now the reason why I'm
05:39 - being very upfront about my plan is so
05:41 - you can make your own informed decision
05:42 - if you're the kind of person who would
05:43 - buy the premium version and then be
05:45 - annoyed when some sections are made free
05:47 - in the future if so then really please
05:49 - don't buy it only buy it if you can
05:51 - afford it and if you're okay with the
05:52 - video lectures being free in the future
05:54 - and if you want all the bonuses for the
05:55 - premium version So speaking of that here
05:57 - are the bonuses for the premium version
05:59 - I came up with some that I think are
06:00 - really awesome and definitely worth it
06:02 - if you can't afford them well at the
06:04 - same time not putting any knowledge
06:05 - behind the pay wall so even people who
06:07 - can't afford it they can still learn
06:08 - from the pre lectures they really just
06:10 - need to do a little bit of extra work
06:12 - themselves the premium version is really
06:13 - just selling convenience making it
06:15 - really easy for you to truly gain the
06:16 - knowledge the premium version comes with
06:18 - a companion project this is a Unity
06:20 - project that contains a bunch of extra
06:22 - content basically the video lectures
06:24 - while being preas of themselves they're
06:26 - still really only half the course the
06:28 - other half of it is inside of this
06:29 - project it has a bunch of custom editor
06:31 - Windows to guide you through each
06:32 - lecture and each lecture has a section
06:34 - on frequently asked questions these are
06:37 - common questions that have some really
06:38 - detailed answers that provide even more
06:40 - details on what is covered in the
06:41 - lecture then there are some quizzes
06:43 - these are multiple choice questions
06:45 - again all with very detailed answers
06:46 - it's really not just correct or
06:48 - incorrect if you pay close attention to
06:50 - each lecture you should be able to get
06:51 - most of these right but whether you do
06:53 - or don't by reading the extra
06:54 - explanation that will help you truly
06:56 - learn that topic then the interactive
06:58 - exercises I'm really happy with this
06:59 - this feature I think this will really
07:01 - help you learn learning by doing is
07:03 - always much better and these exercises
07:05 - encourage you to put what you learned
07:06 - into practice instead of just blindly
07:08 - watching the video lectures I designed a
07:10 - ton of handcraft exercises for all the
07:11 - lectures to help you put into practice
07:13 - and truly learn the contents of each
07:15 - lecture there are all kinds of exercises
07:17 - some are about spotting and fixing
07:19 - errors others are about asking you to
07:20 - Define some function or class or
07:22 - Implement some kind of logic there are
07:24 - some where you just write code and some
07:25 - where you write code and then play the
07:27 - code in unity in order to complete the
07:28 - exercise then each exercise also
07:30 - contains a hint just in case you get
07:31 - stuck or a solution in case you get
07:33 - really stuck as well as a video walk
07:36 - through of me going through that
07:37 - exercise and completing it while
07:38 - explaining everything in detail so if
07:40 - you're the kind of person who gets stuck
07:41 - in tutorial hell then I truly believe
07:43 - that this will really help you escape it
07:44 - in order to learn need to actually do
07:46 - things and this exercise encourage you
07:48 - to do that they encourage you to do it
07:49 - as opposed to just blindly watching the
07:51 - video lectures then the companion
07:52 - project also has a companion window
07:54 - basically this window is also listening
07:56 - to a bunch of errors and if it finds one
07:58 - it will help guide you in the right
07:59 - direction
08:00 - I manually wrote a ton of texts for when
08:02 - to text lots of errors all of them based
08:04 - on common errors that I see people ask
08:05 - about in comments in my own videos so
08:07 - this should help prevent you from
08:09 - getting stuck in your Learning Journey
08:10 - and allow you to get helped instantly
08:12 - then the course also has an AI to help
08:14 - you answer questions this one was
08:16 - trained on the contents of the course
08:17 - and my own knowledge so it should be
08:19 - very accurate and helpful but more than
08:21 - that it's simply the fact that it is
08:22 - extremely fast you post a question in
08:24 - the course comments and within a few
08:25 - minutes the will respond with probably a
08:27 - very good answer although of course I
08:29 - myself will also still be answering all
08:30 - the questions manually the goal with
08:32 - this AI is really speed so you get a
08:34 - response almost instantly and then
08:35 - within the next few hours I will
08:37 - manually insert myself then a simple
08:39 - bonus is how the premium version has the
08:40 - course split into lectures as opposed to
08:42 - Here on YouTube where it will be one
08:43 - giant video it has to be that way due to
08:46 - how the YouTube algorithm works this is
08:48 - a small thing but it can be helpful
08:49 - especially if you take your time to
08:51 - slowly go through the course just like
08:52 - you should do remember that the only
08:54 - goal is really that you are actually
08:55 - learning yourself it does not matter how
08:57 - quickly you go through it so so separate
08:59 - lectures help with that so that you can
09:01 - pause and actually try out your
09:02 - knowledge before going further and you
09:04 - don't have to memorize specific time
09:06 - stamps and over here on YouTube the
09:08 - videos have the normal YouTube ads as
09:09 - usual whereas the premium version has no
09:11 - ads so there's nothing to interrupt you
09:13 - while you're learning another really
09:14 - nice bonus of the premium version is
09:15 - something that I'm going to try out for
09:17 - the first time which is a live study
09:18 - group basically once or twice per week I
09:21 - will go live and post a link to the live
09:22 - stream so people can join in there I
09:24 - will watch the lectures alongside of you
09:26 - then we're all going to read the
09:27 - frequently asked questions together do
09:28 - all the quizzes and go through all the
09:30 - exercises naturally I won't be reading
09:32 - the chat so I won't be able to answer
09:34 - any specific questions you have I've
09:36 - really never done anything like this so
09:38 - I'm really curious to hear what you all
09:39 - think some people like to learn more as
09:41 - part of a group so hopefully this should
09:42 - be quite fun the first live study group
09:44 - is happening next Saturday March 9th and
09:46 - if you can't attend live then as always
09:48 - they won't be recorded so you can watch
09:49 - the recordings later and final bonus is
09:52 - really just by knowing that by buying
09:53 - the premium version you won't be helping
09:55 - hit the goal to make the free video
09:56 - version available for everyone so you
09:58 - will be helping helping to make
09:59 - knowledge available to anyone who wants
10:01 - to learn so these are the nice bonuses
10:03 - that I came up with that I think are
10:04 - really nice and really awesome while not
10:05 - taking away anything or putting any
10:07 - knowledge behind the pay wall if you can
10:09 - afford then I highly recommend the
10:10 - premium version these bonuses will help
10:12 - you truly learn and learn much much
10:14 - faster than the 10 years that it took me
10:16 - but if you can't afford it that's okay
10:18 - like I said there's no hidden knowledge
10:19 - hidden behind the paywall you really
10:21 - just need to put more effort in yourself
10:23 - in order to actually apply knowledge
10:24 - that you gain the free beginner video
10:26 - won be out next week and if you want you
10:27 - can go ahead and pick up the pre version
10:29 - right now there's a link description I
10:31 - added a nice launch discount so you can
10:33 - get it before the first live study group
10:34 - next Saturday so whether you get the
10:36 - premium version or watch you free
10:37 - lectures I really hope you'll learn a
10:38 - lot this has been a ton of work but I'm
10:40 - really proud of the final result I
10:42 - really did put in as much of my
10:43 - knowledge as I could in this course this
10:45 - is basically the course that I wish I
10:46 - had when I got started basically what
10:48 - took me a decade to learn you can now
10:50 - learn much much faster all right so
10:52 - check the link in the description to get
10:53 - the course right now or stay tuned next
10:54 - week thanks so much for watching and
10:56 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your KMI and my C course is finally ready I've been working nonstop on this for months you might have noticed that I really haven't published many regular videos lately this is really why I'm very tired very stressed out but extremely happy with the final result I put all my knowledge all my 10 years of experience into this one course and I made some really interesting content to help you Tru and learn it has 56 stepbystep video lectures then there are 389 frequently asked questions to provide extra clarification on each lecture there's 358 multiple choice quizzes to put your knowledge of each lecture into the test and very importantly there are 83 interactive exercises these require you to put into practice the contents of each lecture so you can actually truly learn this last one is really special you only truly learn by doing as opposed to just watching a video and all of these exercises were handcraft By Me In order to help you truly learn the contents of each lecture this course has all this as well as some other really nice bonus that I'm going to mention in a little bit honestly I'm really happy with this course this is basally the course that I wish I had 10 years ago when I started learning C if I had this back then I would have gained my knowledge much much faster so I really truly hope this helps you a lot in your Learning Journey at the same time right now there are only the first two sections the beginner and the intermediate one building all of this was a ton of work and I don't want to delay the launch since these two sections are ready right now but the goal is for this course to be a complete C course from absolute beginner to very Advanced I want this to be the ultimate C Mastery course so for the next month I will be working on the advaned section and it will eventually be coming out as a free update now for the topic in the title of this video personally I'm a big believer in education I think it's really awesome how nowadays as long as you have an internet connection you have the ability to learn literally anything and also think it's very important that there is high quality education

intermediate and advanced topics now the reason why I'm being very upfront about my plan is so you can make your own informed decision if you're the kind of person who would buy the premium version and then be annoyed when some sections are made free in the future if so then really please don't buy it only buy it if you can afford it and if you're okay with the video lectures being free in the future and if you want all the bonuses for the premium version So speaking of that here are the bonuses for the premium version I came up with some that I think are really awesome and definitely worth it if you can't afford them well at the same time not putting any knowledge behind the pay wall so even people who can't afford it they can still learn from the pre lectures they really just need to do a little bit of extra work themselves the premium version is really just selling convenience making it really easy for you to truly gain the knowledge the premium version comes with a companion project this is a Unity project that contains a bunch of extra content basically the video lectures while being preas of themselves they're still really only half the course the other half of it is inside of this project it has a bunch of custom editor Windows to guide you through each lecture and each lecture has a section on frequently asked questions these are common questions that have some really detailed answers that provide even more details on what is covered in the lecture then there are some quizzes these are multiple choice questions again all with very detailed answers it's really not just correct or incorrect if you pay close attention to each lecture you should be able to get most of these right but whether you do or don't by reading the extra explanation that will help you truly learn that topic then the interactive exercises I'm really happy with this this feature I think this will really help you learn learning by doing is always much better and these exercises encourage you to put what you learned into practice instead of just blindly watching the video lectures I designed a ton of handcraft exercises for all the lectures to help you put into practice and truly learn the contents of each lecture there are all kinds of exercises some are about spotting and fixing errors others are about asking you to Define some function or class or Implement some kind of logic there are some where you just write code and some where you write code and then play the code in unity in order to complete the exercise then each exercise also contains a hint just in case you get stuck or a solution in case you get really stuck as well as a video walk through of me going through that exercise and completing it while explaining everything in detail so if you're the kind of person who gets stuck in tutorial hell then I truly believe that this will really help you escape it in order to learn need to actually do things and this exercise encourage you to do that they encourage you to do it as opposed to just blindly watching the video lectures then the companion project also has a companion window basically this window is also listening to a bunch of errors and if it finds one it will help guide you in the right direction I manually wrote a ton of texts for when to text lots of errors all of them based on common errors that I see people ask about in comments in my own videos so this should help prevent you from getting stuck in your Learning Journey and allow you to get helped instantly then the course also has an AI to help you answer questions this one was trained on the contents of the course and my own knowledge so it should be very accurate and helpful but more than that it's simply the fact that it is extremely fast you post a question in the course comments and within a few minutes the will respond with probably a very good answer although of course I myself will also still be answering all the questions manually the goal with this AI is really speed so you get a response almost instantly and then within the next few hours I will manually insert myself then a simple bonus is how the premium version has the course split into lectures as opposed to Here on YouTube where it will be one giant video it has to be that way due to how the YouTube algorithm works this is a small thing but it can be helpful especially if you take your time to slowly go through the course just like you should do remember that the only goal is really that you are actually learning yourself it does not matter how quickly you go through it so so separate lectures help with that so that you can pause and actually try out your knowledge before going further and you don't have to memorize specific time stamps and over here on YouTube the videos have the normal YouTube ads as usual whereas the premium version has no ads so there's nothing to interrupt you while you're learning another really nice bonus of the premium version is something that I'm going to try out for the first time which is a live study group basically once or twice per week I will go live and post a link to the live stream so people can join in there I will watch the lectures alongside of you then we're all going to read the frequently asked questions together do all the quizzes and go through all the exercises naturally I won't be reading the chat so I won't be able to answer any specific questions you have I've really never done anything like this so I'm really curious to hear what you all think some people like to learn more as part of a group so hopefully this should be quite fun the first live study group is happening next Saturday March 9th and if you can't attend live then as always they won't be recorded so you can watch the recordings later and final bonus is really just by knowing that by buying the premium version you won't be helping hit the goal to make the free video version available for everyone so you will be helping helping to make knowledge available to anyone who wants to learn so these are the nice bonuses that I came up with that I think are really nice and really awesome while not taking away anything or putting any knowledge behind the pay wall if you can afford then I highly recommend the premium version these bonuses will help you truly learn and learn much much faster than the 10 years that it took me but if you can't afford it that's okay like I said there's no hidden knowledge hidden behind the paywall you really just need to put more effort in yourself in order to actually apply knowledge that you gain the free beginner video won be out next week and if you want you can go ahead and pick up the pre version right now there's a link description I added a nice launch discount so you can get it before the first live study group next Saturday so whether you get the premium version or watch you free lectures I really hope you'll learn a lot this has been a ton of work but I'm really proud of the final result I really did put in as much of my knowledge as I could in this course this is basically the course that I wish I had when I got started basically what took me a decade to learn you can now learn much much faster all right so check the link in the description to get the course right now or stay tuned next week thanks so much for watching and I'll see you next time
