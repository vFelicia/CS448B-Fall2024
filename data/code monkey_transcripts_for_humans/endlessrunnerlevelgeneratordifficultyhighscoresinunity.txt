00:00 - in this video we're going to handle
00:01 - infinite map generation with difficulty
00:03 - for a endless runner we're going to
00:06 - create in level parts of varying
00:07 - difficulties and make it harder as the
00:09 - player goes along let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:20 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:23 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:25 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:27 - video helpful consider subscribing so
00:29 - this is our goal we have our plane here
00:31 - some coins and some spikes he starts off
00:33 - stop and as soon as I press space there
00:35 - he goes off running and you can see I
00:39 - can dodge the spikes and jump up as soon
00:41 - as I grab a coin you can see the counter
00:43 - increasing and all the platforms are
00:46 - being instantiated now as I move forward
00:49 - and more platforms are instantiating
00:51 - they won't stop being the easy ones and
00:54 - they become the medium platforms and
00:56 - they are more difficult and grab from a
00:59 - different list and as I keep moving now
01:06 - there are hard platforms being spawned
01:08 - they are more difficult and down and if
01:10 - I keep moving even further and there you
01:15 - we now have the impossible platforms
01:17 - being spawned and if I done right now
01:20 - and there you go I'm dead now it asks me
01:22 - for a name so I can put a simple name
01:24 - and with the score of 57 and there you
01:27 - go there's our nice high score table
01:29 - storing our score so with this we have a
01:32 - nice simple completed endless runner
01:34 - minion alright so this is our goal let's
01:37 - get to it so here we have our starting
01:39 - point we've got our character right here
01:41 - bunch of coins spikes and our platforms
01:43 - and I can press space in order to start
01:46 - running and there he goes and as he runs
01:48 - the map is being automatically generated
01:50 - so as he gets to the edge more level
01:53 - parts are being spawned and they are
01:56 - picked randomly from a selection of
01:58 - parts that we manually created so we can
02:00 - pause and look at the scene view and
02:03 - here as we move forward you won't be
02:06 - able to see various level parts being
02:08 - automatically generated so jump jump and
02:11 - it gets the edge yep there's one being
02:12 - in Senshi ated and another one and so on
02:14 - okay great so right now we have a
02:16 - infinite map generation this is the same
02:19 - that was made in the 11th generation
02:21 - video so check the link in the
02:22 - description to see how we get to this
02:24 - point so in here essentially we have
02:26 - infinite level generation however we
02:28 - also have everything
02:30 - exactly the same so there's no
02:31 - difficulty change or any differences it
02:33 - just keeps going with the exact same
02:35 - level parts now we want to expand upon
02:37 - this and create more 11 parts with
02:39 - different difficulty and then randomly
02:41 - choose one based on a certain difficulty
02:43 - factor so let's get to it all right here
02:47 - in our scene view you can see we have
02:49 - our six different level parts now let's
02:51 - start by making a different one so let's
02:54 - just people keep this one and well let's
02:57 - call this the lesson park medium one so
03:00 - this won't be a part of medium
03:02 - difficulty now in here let's leave this
03:04 - pretty much the same just a simple
03:05 - platform and let's tint it in a
03:08 - different color just to make sure that
03:09 - it is being correctly spawned so here it
03:12 - is we just simpleton so we can easily
03:14 - identify it
03:15 - now let's update our prefab and let's
03:18 - get to the code so over here is our
03:20 - little generator we have a reference to
03:23 - the starting level part we have a list
03:25 - for only on level parts that we can
03:27 - instantiate any reference or player so
03:30 - as the player moves towards the last end
03:32 - position once he gets within a certain
03:34 - distance we simply spawn another 11 part
03:36 - okay now in order to modify this we're
03:39 - going to have multiple lists so here
03:41 - this won't be the level part easy and
03:43 - list and level dark medium list so here
03:50 - in the editor we can drag our local
03:52 - parts and for now let's just drag this
03:54 - one into the easy and this one into the
03:56 - medium okay so far so good
03:59 - now we need to figure out how we're
04:01 - going to define our difficulty there are
04:03 - many ways we can do it we could for
04:05 - example make it based on coins so at a
04:07 - certain number of coins it would
04:08 - increase the difficulty or we can make
04:11 - it based on the number of platforms
04:12 - let's go with out so we're here in the
04:14 - code let's see where we're spawning the
04:16 - next level part so here is the spawn
04:19 - level part when the player reaches the
04:21 - end and whenever we do this let's
04:23 - increase a counter then here a private
04:26 - int for the level parts
04:29 - spawn
04:31 - and when we spawn will be simply
04:33 - increasing and in here we are selecting
04:36 - our chosen level part so in here we can
04:39 - do a very simple if so we do a f11 part
04:42 - spawned if it is bigger than 10 then we
04:45 - want to grab it from the immediate list
04:55 - so over here by default we are choosing
04:58 - a easy level part and if we have spawned
05:01 - more than 5 then we've picked from the
05:03 - medium list all right let's test ok here
05:06 - we are let's start running and there we
05:09 - go and there's the first one being
05:10 - spawned and it's an easy on level part
05:12 - there's the second one
05:13 - the third the fourth the fifth and now
05:16 - let's see the six since we put just
05:20 - bigger than and there is our medium
05:23 - level part so there you go and now they
05:25 - are all medium ok awesome so we have
05:27 - correctly selected our chosen level part
05:30 - based on how many we have spawned so
05:32 - right now the game starts on easy and
05:33 - then becomes medium so just like that if
05:36 - you can already see where we're going
05:38 - with this code now instead of doing all
05:40 - our ifs in here on our spawn level part
05:42 - let's make a function dedicated to
05:44 - complain indeed difficult so this
05:48 - function will return the current
05:50 - difficulty now in order to identify it
05:52 - let's build a very simple inner so here
05:55 - a private enum for our difficulty let's
06:00 - have easy medium hard and impossible and
06:05 - down here let's return it from our
06:08 - function and here we can define our
06:10 - thresholds
06:17 - okay so here we define our values and
06:20 - now we have our nice function returning
06:22 - our difficulty it's not the spawn
06:24 - function and here we can just do a very
06:26 - simple switch to do a switch on the yet
06:31 - difficulty and by default we pick from
06:34 - the easy and list okay so now we have
06:52 - our cleaned up code we select the list
06:54 - of level parts based on our get
06:56 - difficulty and then we simply pick a
06:58 - random one now let's make the other own
07:00 - lists okay now all we need to do is fill
07:10 - it up so here on the editor
07:25 - so we have our four types the easy the
07:28 - medium the hard and the impossible we
07:31 - just drag our references into our level
07:33 - generator and now let's test okay here
07:37 - we are and start running and let's see
07:40 - we put five different per difficulty so
07:43 - this is the first one this is the second
07:45 - one the third that's the fourth one and
07:47 - that's the fifth and there you go we
07:49 - start seeing our medium platforms and as
07:52 - we move forward yep there we go now we
07:56 - have a hard platform being spawned and
07:58 - afterwards yep there it is there's our
08:01 - impossible platform being spun okay
08:03 - awesome
08:04 - so now that we have our logic working
08:07 - it's time to build our content however
08:09 - before we do that let's make it very
08:10 - easy in order to test so let's go into
08:13 - our code here and let's go up and make
08:18 - another serialize field for a transform
08:20 - and this will be the prefab for the
08:22 - testing platform so this will be
08:27 - essentially platform that we wish to
08:29 - test so we can go here on our awake
08:32 - in here let's see if our prefab field if
08:36 - it is not known then we are using our
08:39 - testing platform so we can do a simple
08:41 - debug log in order to say that we are
08:44 - using the debug testing platform this is
08:50 - very helpful for us to build our content
08:52 - and now on our spawning platform down
08:55 - here when we are spawning the unlevel
08:57 - part if our testing platform is
09:00 - different from now then we put our
09:01 - chosen level part as our PF testing
09:04 - platform okay awesome so this shouldn't
09:07 - let us quickly test whatever platform we
09:09 - need to test now here on the local
09:11 - generate let's for example drag the
09:13 - impossible reference and now every
09:16 - single one should be our impossible
09:17 - level part so let's see goes up and as
09:21 - he goes yup there you go he's spawning
09:22 - down okay awesome and we can see on the
09:25 - debug there it is there is our nice
09:26 - hopeful message okay so this one will
09:29 - help us in order to build our content
09:30 - now let's do it
10:41 - so here we are and I have built a bunch
10:44 - of moving parts for each difficulty
10:46 - level and all of them have been added to
10:48 - the various lists so as you can see the
10:51 - easy one starts out very simple then the
10:54 - medium then the hard and then the
10:56 - impossible as you can see the platform's
10:58 - become smaller they get more spikes and
11:00 - also more coins on the impossible they
11:03 - pretty much require perfect time so
11:06 - let's test and try to reach the
11:07 - impossible level so for starters here we
11:10 - are start running and there you go we
11:12 - start with our easy platforms and after
11:15 - a while there you go there's our medium
11:25 - platform starting to spawn and spawn
11:28 - more and take various from the random
11:31 - list okay okay there are you know we
11:34 - have the hard platforms being spawned
11:37 - and now let's see if I can make it to
11:39 - the impossible and just a couple more
11:43 - and yet there are the Impossibles being
11:47 - spawned so now these are very very
11:50 - difficult and there you go I've lost
11:52 - alright okay awesome
11:53 - so we have all our various difficulties
11:55 - being spawned based on how far we get
11:58 - so our logic is working pretty much
12:00 - perfectly now for just one final thing
12:03 - with difficulty and our coin score
12:05 - working let's just add a very simple
12:07 - high score table so over here is the
12:10 - high score table that was built in a
12:11 - previous video check down in the
12:13 - description to see how we created this
12:15 - now let's apply this to our project so
12:18 - I'm going to copy the table into my
12:20 - scene
12:31 - here is a patty DUI let's see the code
12:34 - here's the table code here we have our
12:38 - code for adding a high score entry and
12:40 - the whole thing already supports saving
12:43 - and loading so with the table here the
12:45 - first thing we need to do is make sure
12:46 - we show it when we died over here we
12:49 - have the die function this is what's
12:52 - triggered when the player hits a spike
12:53 - or starts falling very fast as you can
12:55 - see it shows e game over window which
12:57 - shows the retry button now before we
13:00 - show let's come late our scores so an
13:02 - end for the final score Emma let's say
13:04 - our score is based on the coin amount
13:06 - plus the level generator and get the
13:09 - 11-part spot all right so with our final
13:23 - score we go into that high score table
13:25 - in order to hand our entry now in here
13:29 - we need the name so for now let's just
13:31 - put a testing name just to make sure
13:32 - that this works
13:34 - okay let's try okay so here we are and
13:37 - if we weren't straight into our spike if
13:40 - there you go there's our high score
13:41 - table okay everything is working now
13:44 - let's add our name
14:03 - so here let's make a quick script okay
14:23 - so here's the very simple script we just
14:25 - have a static function in order to show
14:27 - it takes a score and the action in order
14:30 - to submit our name and in here we simply
14:33 - have an input film that we can input
14:35 - with our name so here in the canvas
14:37 - here's how it's set up
14:38 - we simply have our name tags which has a
14:41 - text and an input field and here we set
14:44 - the unvalidated input notice that our
14:45 - character two upper and on show we
14:48 - simply selected someone let's test this
14:50 - out let's go into the player and here
14:52 - let's comment out these two and instead
14:55 - of going to the high score name input
14:57 - window in order to show let's show the
15:00 - final score and right now let's not do
15:02 - anything with this just a test to see if
15:06 - it shows up let's do it
15:07 - people don't walk on the name okay let's
15:10 - see okay here we are let's now on the
15:12 - first spike and when we hit it yep there
15:15 - you go there's our name now let's say a
15:16 - B C any of there you go there's on the
15:19 - log ABC okay awesome so we have pretty
15:22 - much everything working now in here
15:24 - instead of doing a TV a vlog we submit
15:26 - our name
15:33 - okay let's try dying and there you go
15:36 - hit the spike okay a VC yep there you go
15:39 - ABC with a score of eight
15:40 - now let's retry now let's get a bit
15:43 - further so here we are jumped a couple
15:46 - jump it up on okay now let's fall and
15:50 - die and we fall in yup were that now
15:52 - let's say test any of there you go we go
15:55 - up there with 14 okay awesome now try to
15:59 - make it as far as possible let's see
16:15 - here are the medium platforms now the
16:33 - hard part forms
16:43 - and I've made to the impossible ones
16:46 - let's see any of there you go I'm dead
16:50 - any up there's my high score right there
16:52 - on the top okay awesome so we have our
16:54 - very nice leaderboard so just like that
16:57 - we have created a MLS runner infinite
16:59 - level generation with increasing
17:01 - difficulty we can easily add more 11
17:03 - parts and more obstacles and coins to
17:05 - make this more very than interesting
17:06 - then we also took the scoreboard that we
17:08 - created previously and added to our
17:10 - project as always you can download the
17:12 - project from the utilities from unity
17:14 - karmic account if you liked the video
17:15 - subscribe the channel for more ent to
17:17 - tourist post any questions you have in
17:19 - the comments and I'll do my best
17:20 - Internet alright see you next time
17:24 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to handle infinite map generation with difficulty for a endless runner we're going to create in level parts of varying difficulties and make it harder as the player goes along let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so this is our goal we have our plane here some coins and some spikes he starts off stop and as soon as I press space there he goes off running and you can see I can dodge the spikes and jump up as soon as I grab a coin you can see the counter increasing and all the platforms are being instantiated now as I move forward and more platforms are instantiating they won't stop being the easy ones and they become the medium platforms and they are more difficult and grab from a different list and as I keep moving now there are hard platforms being spawned they are more difficult and down and if I keep moving even further and there you we now have the impossible platforms being spawned and if I done right now and there you go I'm dead now it asks me for a name so I can put a simple name and with the score of 57 and there you go there's our nice high score table storing our score so with this we have a nice simple completed endless runner minion alright so this is our goal let's get to it so here we have our starting point we've got our character right here bunch of coins spikes and our platforms and I can press space in order to start running and there he goes and as he runs the map is being automatically generated so as he gets to the edge more level parts are being spawned and they are picked randomly from a selection of parts that we manually created so we can pause and look at the scene view and here as we move forward you won't be able to see various level parts being automatically generated so jump jump and it gets the edge yep there's one being in Senshi ated and another one and so on okay great so right now we have a infinite map generation this is the same that was made in the 11th generation video so check the link in the description to see how we get to this point so in here essentially we have infinite level generation however we also have everything exactly the same so there's no difficulty change or any differences it just keeps going with the exact same level parts now we want to expand upon this and create more 11 parts with different difficulty and then randomly choose one based on a certain difficulty factor so let's get to it all right here in our scene view you can see we have our six different level parts now let's start by making a different one so let's just people keep this one and well let's call this the lesson park medium one so this won't be a part of medium difficulty now in here let's leave this pretty much the same just a simple platform and let's tint it in a different color just to make sure that it is being correctly spawned so here it is we just simpleton so we can easily identify it now let's update our prefab and let's get to the code so over here is our little generator we have a reference to the starting level part we have a list for only on level parts that we can instantiate any reference or player so as the player moves towards the last end position once he gets within a certain distance we simply spawn another 11 part okay now in order to modify this we're going to have multiple lists so here this won't be the level part easy and list and level dark medium list so here in the editor we can drag our local parts and for now let's just drag this one into the easy and this one into the medium okay so far so good now we need to figure out how we're going to define our difficulty there are many ways we can do it we could for example make it based on coins so at a certain number of coins it would increase the difficulty or we can make it based on the number of platforms let's go with out so we're here in the code let's see where we're spawning the next level part so here is the spawn level part when the player reaches the end and whenever we do this let's increase a counter then here a private int for the level parts spawn and when we spawn will be simply increasing and in here we are selecting our chosen level part so in here we can do a very simple if so we do a f11 part spawned if it is bigger than 10 then we want to grab it from the immediate list so over here by default we are choosing a easy level part and if we have spawned more than 5 then we've picked from the medium list all right let's test ok here we are let's start running and there we go and there's the first one being spawned and it's an easy on level part there's the second one the third the fourth the fifth and now let's see the six since we put just bigger than and there is our medium level part so there you go and now they are all medium ok awesome so we have correctly selected our chosen level part based on how many we have spawned so right now the game starts on easy and then becomes medium so just like that if you can already see where we're going with this code now instead of doing all our ifs in here on our spawn level part let's make a function dedicated to complain indeed difficult so this function will return the current difficulty now in order to identify it let's build a very simple inner so here a private enum for our difficulty let's have easy medium hard and impossible and down here let's return it from our function and here we can define our thresholds okay so here we define our values and now we have our nice function returning our difficulty it's not the spawn function and here we can just do a very simple switch to do a switch on the yet difficulty and by default we pick from the easy and list okay so now we have our cleaned up code we select the list of level parts based on our get difficulty and then we simply pick a random one now let's make the other own lists okay now all we need to do is fill it up so here on the editor so we have our four types the easy the medium the hard and the impossible we just drag our references into our level generator and now let's test okay here we are and start running and let's see we put five different per difficulty so this is the first one this is the second one the third that's the fourth one and that's the fifth and there you go we start seeing our medium platforms and as we move forward yep there we go now we have a hard platform being spawned and afterwards yep there it is there's our impossible platform being spun okay awesome so now that we have our logic working it's time to build our content however before we do that let's make it very easy in order to test so let's go into our code here and let's go up and make another serialize field for a transform and this will be the prefab for the testing platform so this will be essentially platform that we wish to test so we can go here on our awake in here let's see if our prefab field if it is not known then we are using our testing platform so we can do a simple debug log in order to say that we are using the debug testing platform this is very helpful for us to build our content and now on our spawning platform down here when we are spawning the unlevel part if our testing platform is different from now then we put our chosen level part as our PF testing platform okay awesome so this shouldn't let us quickly test whatever platform we need to test now here on the local generate let's for example drag the impossible reference and now every single one should be our impossible level part so let's see goes up and as he goes yup there you go he's spawning down okay awesome and we can see on the debug there it is there is our nice hopeful message okay so this one will help us in order to build our content now let's do it so here we are and I have built a bunch of moving parts for each difficulty level and all of them have been added to the various lists so as you can see the easy one starts out very simple then the medium then the hard and then the impossible as you can see the platform's become smaller they get more spikes and also more coins on the impossible they pretty much require perfect time so let's test and try to reach the impossible level so for starters here we are start running and there you go we start with our easy platforms and after a while there you go there's our medium platform starting to spawn and spawn more and take various from the random list okay okay there are you know we have the hard platforms being spawned and now let's see if I can make it to the impossible and just a couple more and yet there are the Impossibles being spawned so now these are very very difficult and there you go I've lost alright okay awesome so we have all our various difficulties being spawned based on how far we get so our logic is working pretty much perfectly now for just one final thing with difficulty and our coin score working let's just add a very simple high score table so over here is the high score table that was built in a previous video check down in the description to see how we created this now let's apply this to our project so I'm going to copy the table into my scene here is a patty DUI let's see the code here's the table code here we have our code for adding a high score entry and the whole thing already supports saving and loading so with the table here the first thing we need to do is make sure we show it when we died over here we have the die function this is what's triggered when the player hits a spike or starts falling very fast as you can see it shows e game over window which shows the retry button now before we show let's come late our scores so an end for the final score Emma let's say our score is based on the coin amount plus the level generator and get the 11part spot all right so with our final score we go into that high score table in order to hand our entry now in here we need the name so for now let's just put a testing name just to make sure that this works okay let's try okay so here we are and if we weren't straight into our spike if there you go there's our high score table okay everything is working now let's add our name so here let's make a quick script okay so here's the very simple script we just have a static function in order to show it takes a score and the action in order to submit our name and in here we simply have an input film that we can input with our name so here in the canvas here's how it's set up we simply have our name tags which has a text and an input field and here we set the unvalidated input notice that our character two upper and on show we simply selected someone let's test this out let's go into the player and here let's comment out these two and instead of going to the high score name input window in order to show let's show the final score and right now let's not do anything with this just a test to see if it shows up let's do it people don't walk on the name okay let's see okay here we are let's now on the first spike and when we hit it yep there you go there's our name now let's say a B C any of there you go there's on the log ABC okay awesome so we have pretty much everything working now in here instead of doing a TV a vlog we submit our name okay let's try dying and there you go hit the spike okay a VC yep there you go ABC with a score of eight now let's retry now let's get a bit further so here we are jumped a couple jump it up on okay now let's fall and die and we fall in yup were that now let's say test any of there you go we go up there with 14 okay awesome now try to make it as far as possible let's see here are the medium platforms now the hard part forms and I've made to the impossible ones let's see any of there you go I'm dead any up there's my high score right there on the top okay awesome so we have our very nice leaderboard so just like that we have created a MLS runner infinite level generation with increasing difficulty we can easily add more 11 parts and more obstacles and coins to make this more very than interesting then we also took the scoreboard that we created previously and added to our project as always you can download the project from the utilities from unity
