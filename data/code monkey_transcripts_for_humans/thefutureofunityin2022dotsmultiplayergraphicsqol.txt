With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - gdc was a while ago and there were a
00:04 - bunch of interesting talks but they were
00:06 - not live streamed on their twitch
00:07 - channel however right now you can find
00:09 - them all in a playlist on the unity
00:11 - channel i'm watching all the talks right
00:13 - now there's quite a bunch of interesting
00:15 - things going more in-depth into various
00:17 - projects they announced recently and of
00:19 - course the talk most people really
00:20 - wanted to see was the roadmap tonk so
00:22 - here's my quick summary of it basically
00:24 - it's exactly what people have been
00:26 - asking for lots of quality of life
00:28 - improvements various performance and
00:29 - stability update and just general
00:31 - incremental updates so nothing too
00:34 - earth-shattering but all the things they
00:36 - have in progress are getting better and
00:37 - better honestly watching this talk my
00:39 - biggest takeaway is really just how much
00:41 - stuff unity does there's so many topics
00:43 - so many use cases and so many teams
00:45 - working on tons of different things for
00:47 - me i just make single player 3d games on
00:49 - my pc using urp and the latest lts
00:52 - version but unity also supports 2d
00:55 - multiplayer hdrp it has editor tools vfx
00:58 - graph shadowgraph terrains mobile
01:00 - consoles raytracing dots profiler vr ar
01:03 - and tons tons more things keeping up
01:05 - with all of those tools is actually one
01:07 - of the reasons why i decided to make my
01:08 - ultimate unity overview course in there
01:11 - i go through all of the dozens of unity
01:12 - tools and features to see what they do
01:14 - and how they work there's already over
01:16 - 15 lectures available in that course but
01:18 - unity has even more that i haven't
01:20 - covered yet so i plan to continue free
01:22 - updates for that course for a long time
01:25 - so here let's look at some quick
01:26 - highlights from the road map tonk but
01:28 - before that this video was sponsored by
01:30 - gamedevguild this is an online
01:32 - conference all about unity game
01:34 - development organized by jason wyman the
01:36 - talks are presented by various unity
01:38 - experts on all kinds of topics so you
01:40 - can learn about performance getting a
01:42 - job in the games industry or going
01:44 - full-time indie learn about vr
01:46 - multiplayer blend shapes game audio and
01:48 - tons more you'll also have a chance to
01:50 - ask questions live and even win some
01:51 - awesome stuff the conference is running
01:53 - from may 24 to 26 and there will be
01:55 - recordings after click the link in the
01:57 - description and register today okay so
01:59 - the road map talks started off once
02:01 - again emphasizing the difference between
02:03 - the lts and the tech versions actually
02:06 - made a video on this topic and it's one
02:07 - of my most watched videos it can
02:09 - definitely be quite confusing if you
02:11 - just started using unity but after a 30
02:13 - second summary it becomes super clear
02:15 - how the versions work and just as i was
02:17 - recording this version 21 lts has just
02:20 - been published ideally you should be
02:22 - using the lts version in your projects
02:24 - it's the most stable one but if you want
02:26 - to see the cutting edge tools that unity
02:28 - is developing then those are on the 22
02:30 - version so then they talked about what
02:32 - were their core pillars for the 21
02:34 - version making sure unity has good
02:37 - workflows for everyone regardless of
02:39 - your area of expertise so making sure
02:41 - both hardcore programmers and designers
02:43 - can work together flawlessly this was
02:45 - primarily by making visual scripting a
02:47 - built-in tool rather than an extra
02:49 - add-on this one was a great addition to
02:51 - the engine
02:52 - and speaking of that just another quick
02:54 - plug if you want to learn about visual
02:55 - scripting you can check out my complete
02:57 - course where i make three unique games
02:58 - all entirely using visual scripting
03:01 - there's not a single line of code
03:02 - anywhere in any of those games
03:04 - so that course really showcases just how
03:06 - capable visual scripting is the course
03:08 - was made with bolt which was the
03:10 - original tool that they bought and then
03:12 - renamed into visual scripting which is
03:13 - now built directly into the engine but
03:16 - 99 of it works exactly the same as in
03:18 - unity 2021 there's only been a handful
03:21 - of changes which i also covered in
03:22 - another video so that one was the big
03:24 - focus in 21 better workflows visual
03:27 - scripting and then also improved acid
03:29 - importing and a bunch more quality of
03:31 - life improvements the other core pillar
03:33 - was faster to quality this includes
03:35 - adding feature sets which automatically
03:37 - install a bunch of packages related to
03:39 - what you want to do much faster to get
03:41 - up and running there were also search
03:42 - improvements to quick search in order to
03:44 - make finding things much faster the
03:46 - profiler was also improved as well as
03:48 - testing with the device simulator then
03:50 - urp and agrp continue getting lots of
03:52 - improvements those improvements are
03:54 - present in the 22 and in the 21 version
03:57 - and more and more platform support so by
03:59 - now unity truly runs on anything you can
04:02 - make a build for ps5 a xbox series x and
04:05 - s and even for apple silicon so those
04:07 - were some of the additions and
04:08 - improvements to the 21 version which has
04:10 - just hit lts for me i always stick with
04:13 - lts so i've been using version 2020 lts
04:15 - in all my projects for the past year so
04:17 - it's going to be nice to finally do an
04:19 - upgrade and look at all these new
04:20 - features then was the part about the 22
04:23 - tech stream quite a lot of things
04:24 - they're working on right now tons of
04:26 - teams working in parallel their main
04:28 - pillars for this release are these ones
04:31 - improved workflows and productivity
04:33 - again just making everything smoother
04:35 - and easier to use with better and better
04:37 - iteration time then also editor
04:39 - customization with the ui toolkit so
04:41 - helping you make better tools to make
04:43 - better games faster visuals that scale
04:46 - on anything so making a gorgeous mail on
04:48 - mobile or pc or webgl also improvements
04:51 - to game performance the plan with
04:53 - version 22 is to get dots to 1.0 by the
04:56 - time the 22lts version is out so if so
04:58 - that should be awesome another great one
05:01 - is the multiplayer foundation their
05:02 - netcode for gameobjects is progressing
05:04 - really nicely so it's hopefully out of
05:06 - preview soon
05:07 - and more and more platform optimizations
05:10 - again making sure that unity games run
05:11 - on any device you want so looking at
05:13 - these pillars i would say they
05:15 - definitely have the right goals in mind
05:16 - if they achieve all of this in this year
05:18 - then version 22 will definitely be epic
05:21 - then they dive a bit deeper into all of
05:22 - these topics i'm just going to briefly
05:25 - go through all of them if you want to
05:26 - watch the full video it's still in the
05:27 - description and in that same playlist
05:29 - you also find dedicated videos to some
05:31 - of these things there's a bunch of talks
05:33 - talking about dots one talking about the
05:35 - enemy cgi another one about the giga
05:38 - project and so on so definitely check
05:40 - out that playlist after watching this
05:41 - video okay so first up there are
05:43 - improvements to the package manager
05:44 - especially for more large teams better
05:47 - compiler performance and net standard
05:49 - 2.1 apis also more search improvements
05:52 - and the ability to use api endpoints to
05:54 - make custom search windows
05:56 - faster acid importing play mode
05:58 - compilation build serialization and more
06:00 - so lots of tiny things to make iteration
06:03 - much faster much better
06:04 - one big area of continued improvement is
06:07 - the ui toolkit making it suitable for
06:09 - building editor tools as well as in-game
06:11 - ui
06:12 - now for this one i'm very interested in
06:14 - having just one tool set for both those
06:16 - use cases will definitely be hugely
06:18 - helpful
06:19 - but at the same time this one is also
06:20 - quite confusing to me i still cannot
06:23 - quite understand what is the state of ui
06:25 - tonkit i thought it was still in preview
06:27 - but upon searching some more apparently
06:29 - the latest package says that it's in
06:31 - preview however the reason why that one
06:33 - is stuck in preview is because it is now
06:35 - built into the engine itself
06:37 - i think that's the case i'm not 100 sure
06:40 - but if that is the case then in the 21
06:42 - lts ui toolkit is now production ready
06:44 - for editor tools just not for in-game ui
06:48 - so if i'm correct about that and someone
06:50 - from unity is watching this then i would
06:52 - ask to add some sort of note on the ui
06:54 - toolkit package it's the first thing
06:56 - that comes up on google and looking at
06:57 - the change log there's no mention of
06:59 - anything so it makes it seem like it's
07:01 - in a ben package but it's obviously not
07:03 - it's now apparently built directly into
07:05 - the engine so that package is no longer
07:07 - used so i'm still a bit confused with ui
07:09 - tonkit but anyway sorry about that
07:11 - engine i'm looking forward to using just
07:13 - a single tool for building both ui and
07:15 - editor windows i think that's going to
07:16 - be great continuing with the 21 road map
07:19 - there were more improvements to both urp
07:21 - and agrp
07:23 - they also mentioned giga this is the
07:25 - project they're currently working on
07:27 - visually it looks really awesome and
07:28 - it's all made in urp
07:30 - basically they have a team using
07:31 - european production and then giving
07:33 - their feedback back to the dev team so
07:35 - everyone benefits also one nice addition
07:37 - is custom post pressing effects
07:40 - right now that's not really something
07:41 - you can do easily
07:43 - i did do a video on one way that you can
07:45 - do that so i did some research and i
07:47 - found a way on how you can make custom
07:49 - post rusting effects
07:50 - but it's quite a bit of a hack so having
07:52 - some proper support is definitely great
07:55 - then on hrp again some more continued
07:57 - improvements and again they also have a
07:59 - team actively using the tool and giving
08:01 - their feedback to the dev team you've
08:03 - probably seen the enemy's short film
08:05 - it's truly impressive gorgeous graphics
08:08 - and the most impressive of all is
08:09 - exactly this everything that you see
08:11 - there is running on a vanilla version of
08:13 - the engine previous demos like adam and
08:16 - the heretic those were gorgeous but in
08:18 - order to work those had tons of custom
08:20 - code to make it look so good however
08:22 - this time of the improvements they are
08:24 - making to get to this level of quality
08:26 - all of those improvements are available
08:27 - to anyone using agrp so no custom code
08:30 - everyone benefits then some more
08:32 - improvements to shadowgraph and vfx
08:34 - graph i haven't actually used them in
08:36 - quite a while i haven't made any special
08:38 - effects in quite some time but
08:39 - improvements are always great something
08:41 - really awesome in version 22 is the
08:43 - spline tool if you need a spline right
08:46 - now i actually made a video where i
08:47 - built a nice class and went through how
08:49 - all of the math works and there's also a
08:51 - bunch of awesome spline tools free on
08:53 - the acid store but still it's really
08:55 - nice to have a built-in tool then there
08:57 - are a bunch more terrain improvements
08:58 - also a bunch of lighting improvements
09:00 - and of course unity is both a 3d and a
09:03 - 2d engine so lots of continued
09:04 - improvements coming to 2d there's a
09:06 - better faster sprite atlas improvements
09:09 - to the physics also lots of animation
09:11 - improvements specifically for authoring
09:13 - 2d animations directly inside unity and
09:16 - specifically for using 2d bones they
09:18 - highlighted their own dragon crashes
09:20 - demo i looked at this one when it came
09:22 - out it's really awesome it's a great
09:24 - showcase of all the awesome 2d tools
09:26 - that unity has
09:28 - and then something small but really
09:30 - awesome are the new templates right now
09:32 - if you go into unity hub and you
09:34 - sunlight version 22 you can actually see
09:36 - the templates previously you only had an
09:38 - empty one with the built-in renderer and
09:40 - then you had the urp and hdrp samples so
09:43 - if you wanted a empty project with the
09:45 - 2d tools you had to create an empty
09:47 - project using the built-in renderer then
09:49 - manually install urp then manually make
09:51 - the 2d render and so on whereas now you
09:54 - just have all of these various templates
09:55 - so you have the 2d empty template and
09:58 - when do it simply automatically installs
09:59 - all of the packages you need to make 2d
10:02 - then also a really nice 3d empty agrp
10:04 - and urp templates again just some nice
10:07 - simple quality of life improvements to
10:09 - make your life easier and starting
10:10 - projects much faster there were also
10:12 - more profiling improvements especially
10:14 - for analyzing memory really useful
10:16 - considering how garbage is always a
10:18 - problem i haven't used the profiler much
10:20 - since i launched my last steam game
10:22 - which was almost 3 years now but it's
10:23 - always nice to see it continuing to
10:25 - improve
10:26 - when working on demos and quick
10:27 - prototypes the pro tap isn't really
10:29 - necessary but it's definitely an
10:31 - absolute must when working on a proper
10:32 - big project then of course one of the
10:34 - biggest things for version 22 is dots
10:37 - the massive update to 0.5 has just
10:39 - released and the plan is to hit 1.0
10:41 - during the 22 lts
10:44 - personally i'm really excited about that
10:45 - i can't wait to see all of the new games
10:47 - that this tech will enable in the coming
10:49 - years something that a lot of people are
10:51 - always asking me for tutorials about is
10:53 - multiplayer a while ago unity bought the
10:56 - ml api and they've been working on it
10:58 - under the new name netcode for game
11:00 - objects
11:01 - for me i'm just waiting for it to come
11:02 - out of preview and when it does i'm
11:04 - definitely going to do tons of tutorials
11:06 - on it there's already a sample game for
11:08 - this one
11:09 - so if you're interested definitely go
11:11 - ahead download it and look at how it
11:12 - works and speaking of netcode
11:14 - dotsnetcode is also in development those
11:17 - two are different tools then also a
11:19 - bunch of platform improvements some
11:21 - things from mobile i don't really do
11:23 - much in mobile development so i'm not
11:24 - sure how significant any of these are
11:27 - for desktop and console there's support
11:29 - for apple silicon which is nice there's
11:31 - the linux editor and some webgl
11:33 - improvements
11:34 - also ray tracing for ps5 and apparently
11:36 - xbox coming soon and of course unity
11:38 - also does both ar and vr there's quite a
11:41 - bunch of improvements on there verified
11:43 - support for openxr basic interactions
11:45 - toolkit and more alright and that's the
11:48 - roadmap as you can see tons of
11:49 - improvements in tons of different areas
11:52 - nothing too earth shattering just lots
11:54 - of improvements across the board if you
11:56 - want more detail definitely go watch the
11:57 - whole tank but more than that go check
11:59 - out all the gdc videos in the playlist
12:02 - i'm watching them all right now and
12:03 - there's quite a lot of interesting stuff
12:04 - there you can learn more about kikaya
12:06 - about the enemies demo you can learn
12:09 - about unity gaming services the trends
12:11 - for gaming in the future and so on so
12:13 - lots of interesting info and with this
12:14 - my takeaway for the int roadmap tonk is
12:17 - that unity is currently great in the
12:19 - present and the future looks great too
12:21 - so if they managed to do all these
12:23 - things this year then version 22 lts
12:25 - will definitely be epic and as some of
12:27 - these things start to come out of
12:28 - preview like for example netcode for
12:30 - game objects dui toolkit ui builder and
12:32 - so on as those have their full release
12:34 - you can definitely expect that i'll be
12:35 - doing quite a lot of tutorials on all of
12:37 - those and of course like i previously
12:39 - mentioned i will continue making tons of
12:41 - updates explaining tons of these tools
12:43 - and features for my ultimate unity
12:44 - overview course alright so that's the
12:46 - unity roadmap for 22 lots of exciting
12:49 - things coming up in the future and don't
12:51 - forget to check out game dev guild to
12:52 - learn from unity experts click the link
12:54 - and register today alright hope that's
12:56 - useful check out these videos to learn
12:58 - some more thanks to these awesome
13:00 - patreon supporters for making these
13:02 - videos possible thank you for watching
13:04 - and i'll see you next time
13:09 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey gdc was a while ago and there were a bunch of interesting talks but they were not live streamed on their twitch channel however right now you can find them all in a playlist on the unity channel i'm watching all the talks right now there's quite a bunch of interesting things going more indepth into various projects they announced recently and of course the talk most people really wanted to see was the roadmap tonk so here's my quick summary of it basically it's exactly what people have been asking for lots of quality of life improvements various performance and stability update and just general incremental updates so nothing too earthshattering but all the things they have in progress are getting better and better honestly watching this talk my biggest takeaway is really just how much stuff unity does there's so many topics so many use cases and so many teams working on tons of different things for me i just make single player 3d games on my pc using urp and the latest lts version but unity also supports 2d multiplayer hdrp it has editor tools vfx graph shadowgraph terrains mobile consoles raytracing dots profiler vr ar and tons tons more things keeping up with all of those tools is actually one of the reasons why i decided to make my ultimate unity overview course in there i go through all of the dozens of unity tools and features to see what they do and how they work there's already over 15 lectures available in that course but unity has even more that i haven't covered yet so i plan to continue free updates for that course for a long time so here let's look at some quick highlights from the road map tonk but before that this video was sponsored by gamedevguild this is an online conference all about unity game development organized by jason wyman the talks are presented by various unity experts on all kinds of topics so you can learn about performance getting a job in the games industry or going fulltime indie learn about vr multiplayer blend shapes game audio and tons more you'll also have a chance to ask questions live and even win some awesome stuff the conference is running from may 24 to 26 and there will be recordings after click the link in the description and register today okay so the road map talks started off once again emphasizing the difference between the lts and the tech versions actually made a video on this topic and it's one of my most watched videos it can definitely be quite confusing if you just started using unity but after a 30 second summary it becomes super clear how the versions work and just as i was recording this version 21 lts has just been published ideally you should be using the lts version in your projects it's the most stable one but if you want to see

everyone regardless of your area of expertise so making sure both hardcore programmers and designers can work together flawlessly this was primarily by making visual scripting a builtin tool rather than an extra addon this one was a great addition to the engine and speaking of that just another quick plug if you want to learn about visual scripting you can check out my complete course where i make three unique games all entirely using visual scripting there's not a single line of code anywhere in any of those games so that course really showcases just how capable visual scripting is the

a bunch more quality of life improvements the other core pillar was faster to quality this includes adding feature sets which automatically install a bunch of packages related to what you want to do much faster to get up and running there were also search improvements to quick search in order to make finding things much faster the profiler was also improved as well as testing with the device

stick with lts so i've been using version 2020 lts in all my projects for the past year so it's going to be nice to finally do an upgrade and look at all these new features then was the part about the 22 tech stream quite a lot of things they're working on right now tons of teams working in parallel their main pillars for this release are these ones improved workflows and productivity again just making everything smoother and easier to use with better and better iteration time then also editor customization with the ui toolkit so helping you make better tools to make better games faster visuals that scale on anything so making a gorgeous mail on mobile or pc or webgl also improvements to game performance the plan with version 22 is to get dots to 1.0 by the time the 22lts version is

in the description and in that same playlist you also find dedicated videos to some of these things there's a bunch of talks talking about dots one talking about the enemy cgi another one about the giga project and so on so definitely check out that playlist after watching this video okay so first up there are improvements to the package manager especially for more large teams better compiler performance and net standard 2.1 apis also more search improvements and the ability to use api endpoints to make custom search windows faster acid importing play mode compilation build serialization and more so lots of tiny things to make iteration much faster much better one big area of continued improvement is the ui toolkit making it suitable for building editor tools as well as ingame ui now for this one i'm very interested in having just one tool set for both those use cases will definitely be hugely helpful but at the same time this one is also quite confusing to me i still cannot quite understand what is the state of ui tonkit i thought it was still in preview but upon searching some more apparently the latest package says that it's in preview however the reason why that one is stuck in preview is because it is now built into the engine itself i think that's the case i'm not 100 sure but if that is the case then in the 21 lts ui toolkit is now production ready for editor tools just not for ingame ui so if i'm correct about that and someone from unity is watching this then i would ask to add some sort of note on the ui toolkit package it's the first thing that comes up on google and looking at the change log there's no mention of anything so it makes it seem like it's in a ben package but it's obviously not it's now apparently built directly into the engine so that package is no longer used so i'm still a bit confused with ui tonkit but anyway sorry about that engine i'm looking forward to using just a single tool for building both ui and editor windows i think that's going to be great continuing with the 21 road map there were more improvements to both urp and agrp they also mentioned giga this is the project they're currently working on visually it looks really awesome and it's all made in urp basically they have a team using european production and then giving their feedback back to the dev team so everyone benefits also one nice addition is custom post pressing effects right now that's not really something you can do easily i did do a video on one way that you can do that so i did some research and i found a way on how you can make custom post rusting effects but it's quite a bit of a hack so having some proper support is definitely great then on hrp again some more continued improvements and again they also have a team actively using the tool and giving their feedback to the dev team you've probably seen the enemy's short film it's truly impressive gorgeous graphics and the most impressive of all is exactly this everything that you see there is running on a vanilla version of the engine previous demos like adam and the heretic those were gorgeous but in order to work those had tons of custom code to make it look so good however this time of the improvements they are making to get to this level of quality all of those improvements are available to anyone using agrp so no custom code everyone benefits then some more improvements to shadowgraph and vfx graph i haven't actually used them in quite a while i haven't made any special effects in quite some time but improvements are always great something really awesome in version 22 is the spline tool if you need a spline right now i actually made a video where i built a nice class and went through how all of the math works and there's also a bunch of awesome spline tools free on the acid store but still it's really nice to have a builtin tool then there are a bunch more terrain improvements also a bunch of lighting improvements and of course unity is both a 3d and a 2d engine so lots of continued improvements coming to 2d there's a better faster sprite atlas improvements to the physics also lots of animation improvements specifically for authoring 2d animations directly inside unity and specifically for using 2d bones they highlighted their own dragon crashes demo i looked at this one when it came out it's really awesome it's a great showcase of all the awesome 2d tools that unity has and then something small but really awesome are the new templates right now if you go into unity hub and you sunlight version 22 you can actually see the templates previously you only had an empty one with the builtin renderer and then you had the urp and hdrp samples so if you wanted a empty project with the 2d tools you had to create an empty project using the builtin renderer then manually install urp then manually make the 2d render and so on whereas now you just have all of these various templates so you have the 2d empty template and when do it simply automatically installs all of the packages you need to make 2d then also a really nice 3d empty agrp and urp templates again just some nice simple quality of life improvements to make your life easier and starting projects much faster there were also more profiling improvements especially for analyzing memory really useful considering how garbage is always a problem i haven't used the profiler much since i launched my last steam game which was almost 3 years now but it's always nice to see it continuing to improve when working on demos and quick prototypes the pro tap isn't really necessary but it's definitely an absolute must when working on a proper big project then of course one of the biggest things for version 22 is dots the massive update to 0.5 has just released and the plan is to hit 1.0 during the 22 lts personally i'm really excited about that i can't wait to see all of the new games that this tech will enable in the coming years something that a lot of people are always asking me for tutorials about is multiplayer a while ago unity bought the ml api and they've been working on it under the new name netcode for game objects for me i'm just waiting for it to come out of preview and when it does i'm definitely going to do tons of tutorials on it there's already a sample game for this one so if you're interested definitely go ahead download it and look at how it works and speaking of netcode dotsnetcode is also in development those two are different tools then also a bunch of platform improvements some things from mobile i don't really do much in mobile development so i'm not sure how significant any of these are for desktop and console there's support for apple silicon which is nice there's the linux editor and some webgl improvements also ray tracing for ps5 and apparently xbox coming soon and of course unity also does both ar and vr there's quite a bunch of improvements on there verified support for openxr basic interactions toolkit and more alright and that's the roadmap as you can see tons of improvements in tons of different areas nothing too earth shattering just lots of improvements across the board if you want more detail definitely go watch the whole tank but more than that go check out all the gdc videos in the playlist i'm watching them all right now and there's quite a lot of interesting stuff there you can learn more about kikaya about the enemies demo you can learn about unity gaming services the trends for gaming in the future and so on so lots of interesting info and with this my takeaway for the int roadmap tonk is that unity is currently great in the present and the future looks great too so if they managed to do all these things this year then version 22 lts will definitely be epic and as some of these things start to come out of preview like for example netcode for game objects dui toolkit ui builder and so on as those have their full release you can definitely expect that i'll be doing quite a lot of tutorials on all of those and of course like i previously mentioned i will continue making tons of updates explaining tons of these tools and features for my ultimate unity overview course alright so that's the unity roadmap for 22 lots of exciting things coming up in the future and don't forget to check out game dev guild to learn from unity experts click the link and register
