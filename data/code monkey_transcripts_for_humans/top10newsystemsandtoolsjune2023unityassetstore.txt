00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus form of awesome tools and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for June
00:09 - 23. this one is a list of paid systems
00:11 - and tools in the last video I'm already
00:12 - covered the best renew assets and the
00:14 - next one I'll be covering top visions
00:15 - and effects as always there's links to
00:17 - the description and as bonus you can use
00:19 - a coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off
00:20 - your order by the way I'm currently
00:22 - working insanely hard to get my game
00:24 - demo ready for the Sim Festival next
00:25 - week I've implemented something like 10
00:27 - different mechanics this week really
00:28 - productive the game is really starting
00:30 - to take shape I can't wait to have your
00:31 - own play it I really hope you like it
00:33 - make sure you add it to your wish list
00:35 - stay tuned for a testing live stream
00:36 - this weekend and go play it on Monday
00:38 - alright so starting off with a very
00:40 - impressive verified tool it's called hot
00:42 - reload if you don't know what this means
00:44 - then basically it lets you edit code
00:45 - without having to recompile so you can
00:47 - have the game open and playing as normal
00:49 - then you decide you want to change
00:51 - something not just in the editor but
00:52 - actually in the code itself you can just
00:54 - rewrite the code hit save and the code
00:56 - will somehow magically compile in the
00:58 - background and continue running the game
00:59 - with the update code this is something
01:01 - that is usually not possible at all so
01:02 - this is an amazing tool this can really
01:04 - help speed up iteration speed I've heard
01:06 - great things about this tune but I
01:08 - haven't used it myself just yet
01:09 - definitely need to try it it looks
01:11 - extremely impressive then here is a very
01:12 - surprising one which is RPG Maker unite
01:15 - basically you've got RPG Maker directly
01:17 - inside UNT honestly when I first heard
01:19 - about it I was quite confused I thought
01:21 - maybe it was some kind of joke like
01:22 - putting unreal inside Unity but in
01:24 - reality it actually does make sense
01:25 - since RPG Maker isn't necessarily meant
01:28 - to be a game engine but rather it's more
01:29 - of a game maker tool so I'm looking at
01:31 - it like that does make quite a lot of
01:33 - sense this version pretty much
01:34 - integrates RPG Maker directly inside
01:36 - Unity so you can easily build your
01:38 - worlds with tunnel sets you can use all
01:40 - of the unity tools then you can take
01:41 - from their massive library of assets you
01:43 - can grab characters and environments and
01:45 - create entire games all without coding
01:47 - it's definitely a very surprising thing
01:49 - but this is a very interesting release
01:50 - next here is an interesting one to
01:52 - greatly improve performance in your
01:53 - games a while ago I made a video asking
01:55 - the question could you build Zelda
01:57 - inside Unity the answer is yes of course
01:59 - but it does take take quite some work to
02:01 - optimize it this tool is one of the ways
02:02 - you can do that you can take a bunch of
02:04 - individual meshes and then combine them
02:06 - into a single one thus reducing your
02:08 - draw cons the world is split into chunks
02:10 - and meshes are generated while using a
02:12 - very efficient algorithm for very low
02:14 - memory usage so if you're working on a
02:15 - game within a large open world you
02:17 - definitely need to use a tone like this
02:18 - one next here is a small simple tool
02:21 - that does just one thing and does it
02:22 - very well it's called project log and
02:24 - it's a way to write some kind of log
02:26 - directly inside ENT so there's no need
02:28 - to go to an external website or app it's
02:30 - all right there inside the empty you can
02:32 - write whatever you want maybe it's a
02:33 - to-do list maybe some design notes
02:35 - perhaps a message to A co-worker or
02:37 - really just something so you don't
02:38 - forget it's a simple tool that does
02:40 - exactly what you want then here's an
02:41 - interesting one it's AI text-to-speech
02:43 - however the important part is that it's
02:45 - all fully offline text-to-speech can be
02:47 - an interesting feature to add to your
02:49 - game but making it require an internet
02:50 - connection is usually a Dion breaker so
02:52 - the fact that this one runs internally
02:54 - locally that one is great it supports
02:56 - over 15 languages with over 900 English
02:58 - voices it works on platforms except for
03:01 - some reason on webgl next here is one
03:02 - that looks extremely complex but
03:04 - potentially very useful although I'm
03:06 - still not entirely 100 sure what it does
03:08 - it's called texture studio and
03:09 - apparently it's a layer based texture
03:11 - Creator so you can have tons of layers
03:13 - with all kinds of data like different
03:14 - skins for your characters or Vehicles
03:16 - then during run time you can choose
03:18 - which layer you want to be active and
03:20 - easily blend between them you can
03:21 - dynamically modify the elements in all
03:23 - the layers and do all kinds of
03:25 - manipulation the results in the video do
03:26 - look quite impressive you can almost run
03:28 - something like Photoshop directly inside
03:29 - DMD I could see this being quite useful
03:31 - if you want to make tons of variations
03:33 - for your game and do it in a more
03:34 - Dynamic way then if you need some hyper
03:36 - realistic physics here's an interesting
03:38 - one this one caught my eye right away
03:39 - because it has physically accurate
03:41 - propellers meaning they rotate and in
03:43 - turn that rotation actually generates
03:45 - lift when I look at this one the idea
03:47 - that comes to mind would be making a
03:48 - digital twin of a drone then perhaps use
03:50 - ml agents to train that drone inside
03:52 - Unity to fight itself and then build an
03:54 - actual drone in real life and run that
03:56 - code assuming the physics here are
03:58 - indeed accurate that would be a really
03:59 - fun project next if you need to populate
04:01 - a huge world with tons of vegetation
04:03 - then check out this one you've got tons
04:05 - of tools at your disposal to add all
04:07 - kinds of rocks bushes trees and really
04:09 - anything the important part is that all
04:11 - of these elements snap to the train so
04:12 - it's really easy to position them you
04:14 - don't have issues with objects slipping
04:15 - the terrain it all works kind of like a
04:17 - decal so you can place all the objects
04:19 - then you can Implement wins Seasons
04:21 - wetness height blending and a bunch more
04:23 - up next here's a nice one for helping
04:25 - you make tutorials one thing that I
04:27 - always dislike is text only tutorials I
04:29 - find that it really breaks the flow of
04:30 - the game if suddenly I have to read a
04:32 - huge round of text so I'm always a fan
04:34 - of short videos to teach whatever the
04:36 - tutorial wants to teach and this tool
04:37 - helps you do that among many other
04:39 - things you can create a bunch of
04:40 - categories and tutorial items then
04:42 - assign a video and some text then it's
04:43 - up to you to choose how the tutorials
04:45 - are spawned it could be when the player
04:47 - touches something or perhaps during a
04:48 - unloading screen and lastly here we have
04:50 - an interesting one strangely enough this
04:52 - one actually shows up as free when I'm
04:54 - logged in I guess this one is free if
04:56 - you already have some other Infinity PVR
04:58 - pack basically this is a dual for easily
05:00 - combining audio clips to create brand
05:01 - new ones maybe you can combine two
05:03 - impact sounds into another new one you
05:05 - can assign all kinds of layers and then
05:07 - to uncreate all the unique variants
05:09 - between them so with just a handful of
05:10 - inputs you can easily generate hundreds
05:12 - or even thousands of unique sound
05:14 - effects and then you can also add some
05:15 - dla to the clips so one example of how
05:17 - that is useful is on taking some
05:19 - character voice lines and easily combine
05:20 - them together into a single audio thumb
05:22 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:24 - and systems on dnts store for June 23.
05:26 - there's links on the description and as
05:28 - a bonus you can use your coupon code
05:29 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also
05:31 - check out my own free impedance on store
05:33 - stay tuned for a testing live stream
05:34 - this weekend and go play it on Monday
05:36 - alright hope that's useful check out
05:38 - these videos to learn some more thanks
05:40 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
05:42 - making these videos possible thank you
05:44 - for watching and I'll see you next time
