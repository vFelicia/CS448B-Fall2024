00:00 - now health is pretty simple you can
00:01 - really just use any basic health system
00:03 - for this like for example the free one
00:04 - that I made quite a while ago it's a
00:06 - great system it's what I use in many of
00:07 - my games definitely go ahead and just
00:08 - download it for free and use it the
00:10 - health in this game is really just an
00:11 - INT number Super basic but then this
00:13 - game also has a very unique very
00:14 - interesting morale system now the
00:16 - biggest frustration with games like XCOM
00:17 - is the dreaded 98% chance to hit that
00:20 - actually misses that one never feels
00:21 - good that always feels messed up so in
00:23 - this game at least characters have
00:24 - something called morale and if your shot
00:26 - misses it won't deal any health damage
00:28 - but it will still deal morale damage if
00:30 - their morale goes under half then on the
00:31 - next turn they have fewer action points
00:33 - and less chance to hit and if their
00:35 - morale goes to zero they get broken and
00:36 - cannot take a turn personally I really
00:38 - think this is a great system a great
00:39 - mechanic a great addition to this genre
00:41 - it makes the game a lot less random and
00:42 - gives you more control over your own
00:44 - actions in technical terms the morale
00:46 - system is really the exact same thing as
00:47 - the health system it's really just a
00:49 - number that goes down slowly over time
00:51 - so you could use literally the exact
00:52 - same code you could use the exact same
00:54 - Health System just have a second health
00:55 - bar and have that one pretty much just
00:57 - always takes damage even if they shot
00:58 - misses
