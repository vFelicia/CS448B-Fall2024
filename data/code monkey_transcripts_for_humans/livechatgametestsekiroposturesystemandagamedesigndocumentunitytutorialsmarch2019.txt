00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to review all
00:03 - the videos published in March 2019 let's
00:06 - begin
00:09 - March had slightly fewer videos and
00:12 - normal and the reason for that is I have
00:13 - to be focused on the update for been
00:15 - around Tycoon which am VIPs the good
00:18 - news is I took plenty of notes as I was
00:19 - implementing the VIPs and made a nice
00:21 - video showing my process for adding a
00:23 - new feature into the game the VIPs at
00:26 - variety to the game by being special
00:28 - guests with the unique sprites and
00:29 - messages which help keep the game fresh
00:31 - over time it might seem like a somewhat
00:33 - simple system but in order for the final
00:35 - feature to work correctly there are a
00:37 - lot of small things that need to be done
00:39 - so in the video I cover my complete
00:41 - process from starting with a piece of
00:42 - paper until a final implementation of
00:44 - the latest build the game is out on
00:47 - Steam so you can check it out to see the
00:49 - VIPs in action
00:50 - there was a video creating the vitality
00:53 - and posture system from second row
00:54 - shadows die twice this is a really
00:57 - interesting system in the game in that
00:58 - you have essentially two health bars
01:00 - that work in different ways so you have
01:02 - the health bar which is pre normal it
01:04 - goes down with damage and goes up with
01:06 - healing there's also a nice effect to
01:08 - show the amount of damage the player
01:10 - took in the last hit then you have the
01:12 - posture bar which increases as the
01:14 - player Perry's was changing color as it
01:16 - gets full when it gets completely full
01:19 - the posture has been broken and a nice
01:21 - close pride shows up to indicate that
01:23 - it's a very interesting system with the
01:26 - two bars working together and the code
01:28 - is also written in a very clean way by
01:30 - keeping the logic individual separate in
01:33 - a later video we're going to take this
01:36 - system and apply it to some characters
01:38 - while we create the combat system so
01:40 - stay tuned for next month also this last
01:44 - Sunday there was an interesting test
01:45 - with the in live stream it was a
01:47 - interactive life stream which was
01:49 - essentially a test for a game that you
01:51 - can play by typing along in chat I've
01:53 - been thinking about this for quite a
01:55 - while now and this was the first test of
01:56 - what I think could be a really cool
01:58 - thing so many thanks to everyone who
02:01 - showed up to home test out the code now
02:03 - that I know that it does work I can
02:05 - start thinking of more interesting game
02:07 - designs for cool interesting community
02:09 - games so stay tuned to the channel
02:11 - during April for some really cool
02:13 - surprises
02:15 - there were three quick tips videos again
02:19 - these are very short videos that cover a
02:20 - nice tip that you might not know the
02:23 - first one covered how and why you should
02:26 - always use the gnomes for state handling
02:27 - this is one of those things that is
02:29 - extremely important but might be
02:31 - completely unknown to beginners
02:33 - I myself have made the mistake of doing
02:36 - state handling with strings when I was
02:38 - new so in the video I cover actual real
02:40 - problems that happened to me which made
02:42 - me look into a better way of doing
02:43 - things which led me to animus the second
02:47 - video covers another very useful but
02:49 - somewhat hidden feature of unity you can
02:52 - change the number of lines that are
02:53 - displayed in the console per each log
02:55 - entry this is extremely useful for
02:57 - making the console either more compact
02:59 - so you can see a lot of entries at once
03:01 - or make each entry more expanded so you
03:04 - can see more information or the log
03:06 - trace the third quick tip deals with
03:09 - creating game objects specifically the
03:12 - various ways you have of constructing a
03:14 - new game object you can just create one
03:16 - component only default game object using
03:19 - the primary constructor or you can use
03:21 - the optional Constructors to create the
03:23 - game object with a name and pre added
03:25 - components this helps keep your code
03:28 - more clear more compact and also more
03:30 - performing also a summary of the modular
03:35 - sprites as used for guests in battle
03:37 - route thank you this is a great series
03:39 - that teaches you how to copy pixels and
03:41 - tint them in order to create sprites
03:43 - with a lot of variation if you play the
03:45 - game you will see that even with
03:47 - hundreds of guests they are only unique
03:49 - the playlist starts off very simple
03:51 - which is copying basic pixels and
03:53 - through the videos increase in composite
03:55 - so if you want to learn how to
03:57 - manipulate pixels and create modular
03:59 - spreadsheets go check out the full
04:01 - playlist and then pick up the game on
04:02 - Steam there was video covering how to
04:07 - make a shrinking damage circle as used
04:09 - in battle round games this is a prequel
04:12 - element with some interesting logic the
04:14 - circle has a size and a certain position
04:16 - the white circle displays the next size
04:19 - in position which is randomly generated
04:20 - and after some time it starts to shrink
04:23 - towards it everything is completely
04:25 - customizable from the shrink size the
04:27 - random position
04:28 - to the speed of the shrink this script
04:31 - is very versatile and a perfect starting
04:33 - point if you're building a paranoid game
04:37 - then a very interesting video covering
04:39 - something which is very important
04:41 - although not many people talk about it
04:42 - that is learning how the unity transform
04:45 - pivots work and how we can modify them
04:47 - to our advantage
04:48 - by default the pivot point is always in
04:51 - the center which makes some things seem
04:53 - impossible to do like for example a
04:55 - health bar which should scale from one
04:57 - edge instead of from the middle so in
05:00 - this video I cover how the pivots work
05:02 - and how you can be tricky managing
05:04 - transform parents and children to get
05:06 - the pivot exactly where you want it if
05:08 - you are very familiar with how
05:10 - transforms work with the global and
05:13 - local position spaces then you won't be
05:15 - better equipped to create anything in
05:16 - unity one of the videos this month was
05:20 - covering a simple soundmanager so in
05:23 - this video we cover how you can play a
05:25 - sound in the simplest way possible learn
05:28 - how to create a audio source through
05:29 - code and how to manage audio clips in a
05:31 - clean way using anims you can play
05:34 - either 2d or 3d sounds once you know the
05:37 - basics you'll be able to expand upon it
05:39 - by adding more sounds and more features
05:42 - another talking video where I give some
05:45 - game dev advice based on my own
05:46 - experience this one is covering whether
05:49 - you should make a game design document
05:51 - or if it is a waste of time I cover the
05:54 - goal of a game design document and how
05:56 - studios of various scales might have
05:58 - different needs a triple-a studio will
06:01 - have very different requirements than a
06:02 - small one or two-person team in the
06:05 - video I talk about my own experience and
06:07 - how I normally design my games along
06:09 - with how detailed I write my designs
06:11 - before starting to make a simple
06:13 - prototype so that was it for the month
06:17 - of March 2019
06:18 - I hope you found the videos helpful and
06:20 - learned something along the way if you
06:22 - have any questions regarding any of the
06:24 - videos feel free to post them in the
06:25 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
06:26 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
06:28 - see you next time
