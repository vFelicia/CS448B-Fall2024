00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to use the
00:03 - camera system we created previously to
00:05 - move the camera when the mouse touches
00:07 - the edges of the screen well let's get
00:09 - sir
00:13 - so we previously created our camera
00:15 - system and made it very easy to move and
00:18 - zoom around a position so for the scene
00:21 - let's set up our camera to form a
00:22 - position that I will manually move with
00:24 - the keyboard and then later add movement
00:26 - with the mouse so let's go into my game
00:30 - or I have a reference to my cameraphone
00:32 - script so as you saw in the previous
00:34 - video we created a setup function inside
00:37 - that setup function we send it a func
00:40 - that returns a vector3 so in this case
00:45 - let's make a private vector3 to hold our
00:49 - camera follow position and this is what
00:54 - we're going to send to our camera home
00:56 - script and for our zoom let's just send
00:59 - a fixed value let's say a TF just a
01:02 - fixed zoom we don't want to touch that
01:03 - for now so on our private void update we
01:08 - want to test for keyboard input so we're
01:11 - going to do if input dot get king of T
01:14 - code w we're going to implement wise
01:18 - movement so if we press W we're going to
01:21 - increase our camera follow position Y
01:25 - we're going to increase it by a move
01:28 - around and go here float move amount and
01:33 - let's say 20 M + x time.deltatime so
01:38 - this code is frame rate and the pennant
01:41 - okay do the same thing for all the other
01:43 - keys okay so here is my keyboard input
01:51 - and we should now be able to control the
01:53 - camera using the keyboard let's go into
01:55 - our scene test it out there it is I can
01:58 - press W and moves up I can process moves
02:01 - down D moves right and a moves left
02:04 - okay let's actually increase the speed
02:06 - but you know the controls are working so
02:09 - we now have our camera following the
02:12 - vector three for our camera follow
02:14 - position and we're modifying that vector
02:16 - 3 using keyboard input so let's also
02:18 - modify that when the mouse touches the
02:21 - edges of the screen so on our update
02:24 - down here
02:25 - we're going to do a test based on our
02:26 - input mouse position and our screen dot
02:29 - width so in here if input dot Mouse
02:33 - position dot X if it is bigger than the
02:37 - screen dot width minus a edge size
02:41 - let's set up a edge size in here and
02:45 - let's say 10 pixels so if the mouse
02:49 - position that X is bigger than the width
02:51 - minus our edge size so if it is with
02:54 - within 10 pixels of the right side we're
02:56 - going to move it to the right so let's
02:59 - see here I am here's my mouse and when I
03:03 - moved to right when I get within 10
03:05 - pixels it starts moving yep there it is
03:09 - okay let's increase our edge size a
03:11 - little bit and that's support for all
03:13 - the other edges so in here we have
03:15 - moving to the right now let's add moving
03:18 - to the left so that is if the X is less
03:21 - than the edge size then we move to the
03:24 - left then if input that Mouse position
03:27 - dot y if it is bigger than the screen
03:31 - dot height minus our edge size then we
03:35 - want to move up and if it is under the
03:40 - edge size and we want to move down okay
03:44 - so this is the edge to our right this is
03:48 - edge what-o
03:52 - and edge down let's test it out Here I
03:57 - am I can still move it with the keyboard
03:59 - and now let's move the mouse and when I
04:01 - get to the edge there you go moving to
04:04 - the right stops moving up stops moving
04:07 - down stops and moving left and stops
04:10 - okay let's had a simple boolean to
04:13 - enable and disable edge scrolling so
04:16 - let's go up here and make a private bull
04:20 - edge sprawling and on our update let's
04:25 - enable it by pressing space so if input
04:28 - not yet key down
04:31 - of keycode space if we press space let's
04:35 - set our edge scrolling to the inverse of
04:38 - edge scrolling let's pop up a message
04:42 - displaying if it's enabled or disabled
04:44 - so let's go into our code monkey tony's
04:47 - using the CMD bug class which is always
04:50 - you can grab the code monkey utilities
04:52 - from unity code monkey comm so let's go
04:54 - make a text pop up on the mouse position
04:57 - and say edge scrolling and then + edge
05:02 - scrolling and in here we're only going
05:05 - to test this if we are edge from down
05:09 - here and there you go okay let's see if
05:13 - we can enable and disable by pressing
05:15 - space okay here I am I'm moving with a
05:18 - keyboard okay great I go to the side
05:20 - then it is currently disabled I hit
05:23 - space and I can move to the side move up
05:26 - down left right okay awesome I hit space
05:29 - again and it's disabled and there you
05:32 - have it we can Pan the camera normally
05:34 - with a keyboard or scroll by moving the
05:36 - mouse to the edges as always you can
05:39 - download the project files in utilities
05:40 - for free from unity code monkey comm if
05:43 - you have any questions post them in the
05:45 - comments and I'll do my best answer okay
05:47 - see you next time
06:00 - you

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to use the camera system we created previously to move the camera when the mouse touches the edges of the screen well let's get sir so we previously created our camera system and made it very easy to move and zoom around a position so for the scene let's set up our camera to form a position that I will manually move with the keyboard and then later add movement with the mouse so let's go into my game or I have a reference to my cameraphone script so as you saw in the previous video we created a setup function inside that setup function we send it a func that returns a vector3 so in this case let's make a private vector3 to hold our camera follow position and this is what we're going to send to our camera home script and for our zoom let's just send a fixed value let's say a TF just a fixed zoom we don't want to touch that for now so on our private void update we want to test for keyboard input so we're going to do if input dot get king of T code w we're going to implement wise movement so if we press W we're going to increase our camera follow position Y we're going to increase it by a move around and go here float move amount and let's say 20 M + x time.deltatime so this code is frame rate and the pennant okay do the same thing for all the other keys okay so here is my keyboard input and we should now be able to control the camera using the keyboard let's go into our scene test it out there it is I can press W and moves up I can process moves down D moves right and a moves left okay let's actually increase the speed but you know the controls are working so we now have our camera following the vector three for our camera follow position and we're modifying that vector 3 using keyboard input so let's also modify that when the mouse touches the edges of the screen so on our update down here we're going to do a test based on our input mouse position and our screen dot width so in here if input dot Mouse position dot X if it is bigger than the screen dot width minus a edge size let's set up a edge size in here and let's say 10 pixels so if the mouse position that X is bigger than the width minus our edge size so if it is with within 10 pixels of the right side we're going to move it to the right so let's see here I am here's my mouse and when I moved to right when I get within 10 pixels it starts moving yep there it is okay let's increase our edge size a little bit and that's support for all the other edges so in here we have moving to the right now let's add moving to the left so that is if the X is less than the edge size then we move to the left then if input that Mouse position dot y if it is bigger than the screen dot height minus our edge size then we want to move up and if it is under the edge size and we want to move down okay so this is the edge to our right this is edge whato and edge down let's test it out Here I am I can still move it with the keyboard and now let's move the mouse and when I get to the edge there you go moving to the right stops moving up stops moving down stops and moving left and stops okay let's had a simple boolean to enable and disable edge scrolling so let's go up here and make a private bull edge sprawling and on our update let's enable it by pressing space so if input not yet key down of keycode space if we press space let's set our edge scrolling to the inverse of edge scrolling let's pop up a message displaying if it's enabled or disabled so let's go into our code monkey tony's using the CMD bug class which is always you can grab the code monkey utilities from unity code monkey comm so let's go make a text pop up on the mouse position and say edge scrolling and then + edge scrolling and in here we're only going to test this if we are edge from down here and there you go okay let's see if we can enable and disable by pressing space okay here I am I'm moving with a keyboard okay great I go to the side then it is currently disabled I hit space and I can move to the side move up down left right okay awesome I hit space again and it's disabled and there you have it we can Pan the camera normally with a keyboard or scroll by moving the mouse to the edges as always you can download the project files in utilities for free from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer okay see you next time you
