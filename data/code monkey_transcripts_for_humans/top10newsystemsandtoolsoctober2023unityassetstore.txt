00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - the asset store is full of awesome tools
00:04 - and asset to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for October 23 this one is a list of
00:11 - paid systems and tools in the last video
00:13 - I already covered the for new assets and
00:15 - next one I'll cover top visuals and
00:16 - effects as always there's links to the
00:18 - ass in the description and as a bonus
00:19 - you can use your coupon code monkey 10
00:20 - to get 10% off your order also by the
00:22 - way my own game has just come out this
00:24 - month it's a fun game with some
00:26 - automation Colony building and defense
00:27 - mechanics where you can build a colony
00:29 - Auto it and keep the tiny defenseless
00:31 - dinkies safe from harm you can then
00:33 - colonize other planets gather more
00:35 - resources with the ultimate goal of
00:36 - colonizing every single planet and
00:38 - automating everything so your dinkies
00:39 - can finally relax it is out now on seam
00:42 - I hope you like it and please make sure
00:43 - to write a review also right now you can
00:45 - get an only at 50% off all right so
00:47 - starting off with a simple tool to help
00:49 - you make some interesting transitions
00:51 - adding a simple transition like this one
00:52 - is a great way to easily add a bunch of
00:54 - Polish to your game anything more than a
00:56 - hard cut will always look so much better
00:58 - this one has 17 different styles with
01:00 - tons of customization the effects are
01:02 - all very varied there are some super
01:05 - simple swipes some that look like some
01:07 - Toren paper there are some weird
01:09 - geometric shapes really lots of
01:10 - variation in just about any direction
01:13 - you can use it to easily Fade to a solid
01:15 - color like black or use it to smoothly
01:17 - transition from One camera to the next
01:19 - this is indeed a great super simple way
01:21 - to add that extra bit of polish your
01:23 - game next here's a really fun a very
01:25 - unique one called peros Sprite it's a
01:27 - scen view Sprite painter meaning that
01:30 - you create an area in the scene View and
01:31 - really you didn't just draw on it it's
01:33 - certainly a very unique tool that looks
01:35 - like it can be quite useful like for
01:36 - example when prototyping you can super
01:39 - easily draw a rough sketch of exactly
01:41 - what you're trying to build I always
01:42 - waste a whole bunch of time making
01:44 - separate Photoshop files for the various
01:46 - icons in my games being able to draw
01:48 - some temporary icons directly inside
01:50 - Unity that would be quite useful and of
01:53 - course if you are a proper artist then
01:54 - you could even draw some final or near
01:56 - final art just using this tool that
01:59 - could help you save quite a bit of time
02:00 - and it also has a sort of prefab system
02:03 - so as you draw on the original the
02:04 - changes are reflected in all the copies
02:07 - and it even support some animation so
02:08 - you can easily draw things at various
02:10 - frames to make some nice sprad sheet
02:11 - animation honestly this looks like a
02:13 - really impressive very unique tool I'm
02:15 - surprised I've never seen anything like
02:16 - this then if your game has tons of
02:18 - skills then you need a tool to help you
02:20 - visualize all that data check out this
02:22 - one you can define a skill you can give
02:24 - it a name an icon and then Define which
02:26 - skills are requirements for that one you
02:28 - can then upgrade that skill Define a
02:30 - cool down and various properties it can
02:32 - also take all that data and autogenerate
02:34 - some C scripts personally I'm always a
02:37 - fan of this feature always as a fan of C
02:39 - script generation this way you don't
02:41 - have to mess around with tons of strings
02:43 - all over the place this is actually one
02:44 - of my favorite features from the input
02:46 - system you just generate the class and
02:48 - you can then add Logic on various events
02:50 - then for making your game look gorgeous
02:52 - you're going to need some Vol metric fog
02:54 - so here's a tool to help you do that in
02:56 - case you don't know what exactly is
02:57 - volumetric fog that's basically how you
02:59 - can have fog that has an external shape
03:01 - like fog peering through a window or
03:03 - peering through the trees so God R those
03:05 - are an example of a type of volumetric
03:07 - fog it's a simple effect but it always
03:09 - looks really great it gives your
03:11 - lighting gives your scenes a really nice
03:12 - 3D feel the fog can also be affected by
03:15 - lights giving it all kinds of colors and
03:17 - you can even use some light cookies so
03:19 - if you want to improve the visuals of
03:20 - your game definitely look into some
03:22 - volumetric fog next we have a tool
03:24 - called Data driven enums this is a super
03:27 - simple tool for defining some data
03:28 - structures in an and easily choose which
03:31 - ones you want to use in your games so
03:33 - it's kind of a different way of building
03:34 - something like script objects and making
03:36 - it very databased meaning all these
03:38 - types these are not to find at compile
03:40 - time but instead they can be added and
03:42 - modified afterwards this is kind of
03:44 - thing that can be quite useful
03:45 - especially if you plan to add some
03:47 - player modding while you can technically
03:49 - create some script B objects at runtime
03:51 - it is much easier to just read a Json
03:52 - file and import that directly in the
03:54 - game then here's a very unique very
03:56 - strange one called time logger basically
03:58 - it's a logging tool so you can record
04:00 - all kinds of debug. log you can log
04:03 - whenever something happens in your game
04:05 - but then it also has a Time Dimension so
04:08 - you can scrub through a timeline to see
04:10 - what log was fired and when then you can
04:12 - also add some extra gizmos to visually
04:14 - see on what position was that object
04:16 - when that log was fired I can see this
04:18 - being quite useful if you have for
04:20 - example some kind of Target finding
04:21 - logic and you want to visually see when
04:23 - thises unit actually find the targets
04:25 - and where was it when that happened
04:27 - being able to link up a log with an act
04:29 - position the world that can be super
04:30 - useful in various scenarios this one has
04:33 - plenty of unique Gizmo types you can
04:35 - have some super simple boxes or spheres
04:37 - or even some fress room cones and simple
04:39 - vectors definitely very unique
04:41 - potentially very useful tool next if you
04:43 - want to implement some chat in your game
04:44 - but you don't want to have to build an
04:46 - entire feature complete chat system then
04:48 - maybe look at a tool like this one
04:50 - you've got a nice input text box to
04:51 - write whatever you want it has some nice
04:54 - scrolling text field showing all the
04:55 - text then supports various colors and
04:58 - text decoration like bold and font sizes
05:00 - also support some emojis and in demo
05:03 - they also show something like the
05:04 - Counter-Strike kill feed where you have
05:05 - a name and then a weapon icon and then
05:07 - another name I'm assuming that you can
05:09 - also add some custom icons on top so yep
05:11 - building something like this sounds
05:12 - super simple actually I'm thinking of
05:15 - implementing a simple chat system myself
05:16 - in my own game dinking Guardians so
05:18 - perhaps I'll actually pick up this one
05:20 - in order to save me quite a bit of time
05:21 - then if you need to do some spines but
05:23 - you need to do them on the UI inside of
05:25 - the world then check out this one it
05:27 - does exactly what you want it lets you
05:28 - render splines directly in the UI which
05:30 - also means you can then play around with
05:32 - all of the various UI elements so things
05:34 - like masks shadows and outlines those
05:36 - all work with these spine based lines
05:38 - this spine itself can be positioned
05:40 - anywhere you want with whatever curve
05:41 - you want you can even modify various
05:43 - other properties things like texture and
05:45 - size at various points in the spine it
05:47 - even use the job system to make it super
05:50 - performant this is actually the very
05:51 - first tool that I've seen that is built
05:53 - directly on top of unity's recently
05:55 - released official spine package and
05:57 - looking at it this seems to be very well
05:58 - built so this is great news next here's
06:01 - an interesting one so one thing that a
06:03 - lot of people have issues with is 3D
06:05 - path finding since for example the
06:06 - built-in n mesh that one only works on a
06:08 - flat plane so if you need 3D path
06:10 - finding meaning going up and down for
06:12 - that look at a tool like this one this
06:14 - is obviously great for flying units so
06:16 - things like a helicopter or really just
06:18 - some kind of flying monster this one is
06:20 - using go pathf finding meaning goal
06:22 - oriented action planning basically you
06:24 - define a goal with a position in 3D
06:26 - space and the agent tries to complete
06:28 - that goal the goal can also be more than
06:30 - just move here it can be follow or orbit
06:32 - a certain position so if you have any
06:34 - game with some flying units then a tool
06:36 - like this one is definitely a must have
06:38 - then if you need some extra frames one
06:40 - excellent piece of tag is dlss that's
06:42 - deep learning super sampling basically
06:44 - it lets you run your game at a low
06:46 - resolution and then use machine learning
06:48 - to upscale it this one seems really easy
06:50 - to use you just drop the component on
06:52 - the camera and that's really it so this
06:53 - is an excellent addition if your game is
06:55 - GP unlimited the one obvious downside is
06:58 - this only works on Nvidia RTX gpus for
07:01 - things like AMD you have to look into
07:02 - another piece of tag called Fidelity
07:04 - super resolution I think so this
07:06 - specific teag has some limitation but it
07:08 - couldn't hurt to have this option just
07:09 - in case your player does have an RTX GPU
07:12 - all right so those are my top 10 new
07:13 - tools and systems on unur for October 23
07:17 - there's link to in the description and
07:18 - as bonus you can use the coupon code

07:22 - check out my recently released game
07:23 - dinky Guardians and I hope you like it
07:25 - all right hope that's useful check out
