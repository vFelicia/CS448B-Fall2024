00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's look at three methods for
00:04 - how to build a nice and simple scope
00:06 - zoom effect now this is perfect for any
00:08 - game where you have a reference scope
00:10 - with some zoom or maybe just any game
00:12 - where you have some binoculars where you
00:14 - want the player to be able to see
00:15 - further now like i said i'm going to
00:17 - cover multiple methods because there's
00:18 - multiple approaches we can take one is
00:21 - extremely simple but doesn't look very
00:23 - good another one is quite a bit more
00:25 - performant but might not look too good
00:27 - and the final one looks best but also
00:29 - has a certain cost so let's look at all
00:31 - those methods and then it's up to you to
00:33 - decide which one makes more sense for
00:34 - your game if you prefer a more guided
00:37 - path with step-by-step lectures then
00:38 - check out my complete courses learn how
00:41 - to make a builder defender game using
00:43 - sharp just like i make my own steam
00:44 - games or learn how to make games
00:46 - internally using visual scripting or
00:48 - learn all about unity with the ultimate
00:50 - overview course which contains over 13
00:53 - lectures each covering a different tool
00:54 - or feature of the engine to help you
00:56 - make better games faster i'm always
00:58 - available in the courses q a section
01:00 - answering your questions every single
01:01 - day so check out all the courses with
01:03 - the link in the description okay so
01:04 - let's look at various methods for
01:06 - achieving a zoom effect over here is my
01:08 - demo scene i've got a symbol character
01:10 - and i can just look around i've got my
01:13 - sniper rifle and i can press a button in
01:15 - order to bring it up now for the assets
01:17 - over here this is the cindy studios
01:19 - battleground pack there's a link
01:21 - description if you want to get it and
01:23 - for my reference script it's very basic
01:25 - all it does is just listen to some input
01:27 - and then set the animator parameter to
01:29 - play the animation pulling the rifle up
01:31 - or down
01:32 - and finally just got a bunch of events
01:34 - which we're going to hook into in order
01:36 - to do our various methods now if you
01:37 - don't know about events check out my
01:39 - video on it they are super useful okay
01:41 - so let's start by looking at the very
01:43 - first approach which is the easiest one
01:45 - and possibly the very first thing you
01:47 - would try now as you know cameras have a
01:49 - certain field of view and the easiest
01:51 - way to zoom is simply lower that field
01:53 - of view so for this first method let's
01:55 - first get a reference to our camera
02:00 - and when the rifle comes up we simply
02:02 - change the field of view
02:05 - let's put it on a lower amount and when
02:06 - the rifle goes down let me simply reset
02:08 - it
02:10 - and then i just added some buttons in
02:11 - order to zoom in and out so we can also
02:13 - modify these
02:16 - so that's it extremely simple let's see
02:18 - how this looks okay so here it is
02:20 - everything looks normal i bring the
02:21 - rifle up and there you go it zooms in so
02:24 - the camera is lowering the field of view
02:26 - so everything is zoomed in and as i
02:28 - press the button while i'm in here zoom
02:29 - in even further zoom back and so on
02:32 - and yep there you go it does work now to
02:34 - make this look a bit better we can
02:35 - animate it with lerp just like i covered
02:38 - in another video so here's just some
02:39 - basic warp logic
02:48 - so there it is pretty simple i just got
02:50 - a target film the view and that's the
02:51 - thing that changes and then i'm just
02:53 - using a meth.larp in order to lower from
02:56 - the current one onto the target so here
02:58 - it is looking normal i bring it up and
03:00 - there you go a nice and smooth zoom and
03:02 - i zoom in even further and there you go
03:04 - nice and smooth
03:05 - all right so here is the very first
03:07 - method as you can see it's extremely
03:08 - simple all it does is it just zooms in
03:10 - the main camera now the main benefit of
03:13 - this method is it's extremely performant
03:15 - so you don't have any extra shaders
03:17 - there's no extra cameras it is also
03:19 - extremely simple to implement you'll
03:20 - literally just change the camera fov and
03:22 - that's really it but the main downside
03:24 - is that it doesn't look too good ideally
03:27 - you would want just the scope to be
03:28 - zoomed in but in reality the whole
03:30 - screen zooms in so that doesn't look too
03:32 - good but so this is the very first
03:34 - easiest method which does work now for
03:37 - the second method for this one we're
03:39 - going to use a shader in order to zoom
03:40 - in on the area behind it
03:42 - now i actually made a separate video on
03:44 - this topic because it turned out quite a
03:46 - bit more tricky than i expected
03:48 - so in order to make this work i just
03:50 - place down a sphere directly inside of
03:52 - the scope there you go it's a physical
03:54 - object inside of there
03:55 - now this is a sphere i just made it
03:57 - really flat
03:58 - and then it is using this custom shader
04:01 - as you can see it's a very simple shader
04:03 - pretty small
04:04 - what it does is it takes the scene color
04:06 - so that is the colors of the scene on
04:08 - top of this object then it uses the
04:10 - telling and offset mode and modifies the
04:12 - telling in order to actually zoom in
04:14 - and finally the object screen position
04:16 - so this is the tricky thing you can go
04:18 - watch another video to learn how this
04:20 - works in more detail like i mentioned in
04:22 - that video the main issue was with the
04:24 - object screen position
04:25 - so this needs to be dynamically modified
04:28 - as the scope moves within the screen
04:30 - so for that i just have this other
04:32 - script all it does is just grab the
04:34 - camera world to screen point and feeds
04:36 - it onto the shader so this shader won't
04:38 - zoom in on everything behind it so it
04:39 - just needs to be positioned directly
04:41 - inside of the scope and for the logic
04:43 - itself over here the scope is just
04:44 - attached to the object so we don't need
04:46 - to actually modify anything here to
04:48 - script the only thing we need is over
04:50 - here on the zoom out and zoom in in
04:51 - order to modify the parameter on the
04:53 - actual shader
04:58 - so we just do this in order to modify
05:00 - the float variable inside the shader
05:02 - okay so that's it let's test alright so
05:04 - here it is and as i bring the rifle up
05:06 - yep look at that nice zoom
05:08 - so i can name anywhere and get a really
05:10 - nice zoomed in view for example i want
05:13 - to zoom in on that exposure down there
05:14 - and there you go i can do a really nice
05:16 - zoom in and if i press the button i can
05:18 - zoom in even further alright awesome so
05:20 - it does provide a nice zoomed in view
05:23 - now for the pros and cons of this method
05:25 - now the main pro when compared to the
05:27 - previous method is the fact that it only
05:29 - zooms in on the scope itself just like
05:30 - it should
05:31 - so the area behind it stays nice and
05:33 - normal
05:34 - now the next pro when compared to the
05:37 - following method that we're going to see
05:38 - compared to that one this one is much
05:40 - better in terms of performance so we
05:42 - just got a shader effect the camera just
05:44 - renders once and now of course for the
05:46 - cons there is one potentially huge con
05:49 - depending on when you zoom in and you
05:50 - can see it exactly like that if you zoom
05:53 - in just a small amount and everything
05:55 - looks pretty decent however the more you
05:57 - zoom in the more pixelated the image
05:59 - becomes now that has to do with the fact
06:01 - that the image resolution is fixed to
06:03 - the normal resolution so what this
06:04 - shader is doing is really just
06:06 - increasing the size that image it
06:07 - doesn't actually increase the image
06:09 - resolution so the further you zoom in
06:11 - the more pixelated and ugly it becomes
06:13 - so if you want just a small amount of
06:15 - zoom then it works pretty good but the
06:17 - more you take it the more intense it
06:18 - becomes there's a character all the way
06:20 - over there and there you go which is a
06:22 - pixelated mess okay so this is the
06:24 - second method it's pretty good and
06:26 - especially it's very performant
06:27 - now let's check out the very last method
06:30 - you can probably guess what this method
06:32 - will be once again we're going to use
06:33 - the super awesome render textures
06:35 - feature i cover them in detail in
06:37 - another video if you want to learn more
06:38 - about them
06:39 - essentially you can render a camera
06:41 - directly onto a texture so for this
06:43 - third method we're simply going to
06:45 - create a new camera
06:47 - then we're going to position it right in
06:48 - front now here you could position it
06:51 - directly in there so directly in from
06:53 - the scope or you can position it
06:55 - directly in front of the barrel
06:56 - then you just zoom in by lowering the
06:58 - fov
07:00 - then you create a render texture so a
07:02 - new create create new render texture
07:06 - and over here for the settings the main
07:07 - one is the size so this will depend
07:10 - based on your player's resolution and
07:12 - how big the scope is on the screen so
07:14 - something like 10 24 by 1024 is probably
07:16 - more than big enough so you got the
07:18 - random texture and we just make sure
07:20 - that this camera renders onto this
07:21 - render texture okay we can already see
07:23 - that the render texture contains what
07:25 - the camera can see so this is really
07:26 - pretty much all we need now in order to
07:28 - display the visual inside of our scope
07:31 - we can just place a quad directly inside
07:33 - of the scope and then for the visual
07:35 - realm we just need to render our texture
07:37 - and there you go yep that does work that
07:39 - is a view of our zoomed in camera now
07:41 - there's only one slight issue here which
07:43 - is that our quad is a square but the
07:46 - scope is actually round so you can see
07:47 - over here it leaves on the corners so
07:49 - that doesn't look too good
07:51 - now one super easy way to fix this is
07:53 - with a simple alpha clip so here is a
07:55 - very simple custom shader all it really
07:58 - does is just takes a texture for the
07:59 - alpha clip mask and then feeds it over
08:01 - here onto the alpha and then also has an
08:03 - alpha clip threshold so you just need to
08:05 - go into the graph settings make sure you
08:07 - enable alpha clip and then you can feed
08:09 - in the alpha and define the threshold
08:11 - and if you do that and then over here on
08:12 - the alphabet mask if you select you see
08:14 - simple circular mask so something with
08:16 - alpha zero on the outside and there you
08:18 - go it does clip the edges so everything
08:20 - looks perfectly just on the center
08:22 - alright so the final thing is just in
08:24 - the script over here all we need is
08:26 - really the exact same thing that we did
08:28 - on the film the view camera so we can
08:30 - actually just reuse the script
08:32 - we're just going to drag a different
08:33 - reference over here so instead of
08:35 - dragging the main camera we're going to
08:37 - drag the reference to our actual camera
08:39 - that is rendering onto the texture okay
08:41 - so that's it let's test alright so here
08:44 - we are and as i bring the rifle up and
08:46 - if there you go the scope isn't even
08:47 - looking great now press the button or to
08:49 - zoom in even further and there you go it
08:51 - looks great so i'm looking there look in
08:53 - that corner yep looks great look at the
08:55 - character all the way over there yep i
08:57 - can see him and yep there you go the
08:59 - scope doesn't look great now for the
09:01 - pros and cons one of the pros is just
09:03 - like you said on this one i can zoom in
09:06 - exactly as much as i want and as you can
09:07 - see it doesn't have the pixelated
09:09 - problem like the previous method so i
09:11 - can clearly look that character all the
09:13 - way over there then this one also has an
09:15 - interesting property in that it works
09:17 - perfectly well even when the weapon is
09:18 - down
09:19 - so look at that even as i move i'm still
09:21 - seeing all the view over there so if i
09:23 - look all the way over here yep there you
09:25 - go you can see that my weapon is indeed
09:27 - pointed towards the barrel so that's an
09:29 - interesting nice bonus from this method
09:31 - now another pro is that since i'm using
09:33 - a second camera i can actually do some
09:34 - tricky things with it for example i can
09:36 - use a different post processing setup
09:39 - i can add a simple depth of field effect
09:41 - onto the main camera and with that since
09:43 - the render texture is close to the
09:45 - camera then it's not blurred but
09:46 - everything else is so there you go
09:47 - that's another very nice way so
09:50 - personally i think that this is the best
09:51 - visual of all everything else is blurry
09:54 - and the scope is really nice we're only
09:55 - zoomed in so i can see everything nice
09:57 - and clear
09:58 - then if you wanted you could push this
09:59 - even further in order to use a different
10:01 - post processing on the actual camera
10:03 - that is filming the zoom so you could
10:05 - essentially make the scope a thermal or
10:06 - a night vision while leaving the outer
10:08 - area looking normal now of course this
10:10 - approach does have one potential big con
10:12 - which is performance this is using a
10:15 - render texture in order to render the
10:16 - second camera so essentially the whole
10:19 - scene needs to be rendered twice for
10:20 - this to work now if you're making pc
10:22 - games and that's probably not too big of
10:24 - a cost but if you're making a mobile
10:26 - game then it does become a bit of an
10:27 - issue
10:28 - but if you can afford that performance
10:29 - then clearly this is the best method of
10:32 - all you've got two zooms one on the
10:33 - scope and one on the outside then you
10:35 - can zoom in further everything looks
10:36 - great nice effects everything looks
10:38 - awesome and again with this method when
10:40 - compared to the previous one you can
10:41 - zoom in a massive amount and everything
10:43 - looks nice and crisp
10:44 - alright so there you have it three
10:46 - methods for doing a rifle scope go with
10:49 - the first method if you need absolute
10:51 - performance or the simplest method
10:52 - possible go with the second one if you
10:54 - want to look a bit better than that and
10:57 - go with the final method if you want the
10:59 - absolute best visual as possible
11:01 - now go ahead and pick the right one for
11:02 - your game again if you're looking for a
11:04 - more guided path with step-by-step

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's look at three methods for how to build a nice and simple scope zoom effect now this is perfect for any game where you have a reference scope with some zoom or maybe just any game where you have some binoculars where you want the player to be able to see further now like i said i'm going to cover multiple methods because there's multiple approaches we can take one is extremely simple but doesn't look very good another one is quite a bit more performant but might not look too good and the final one looks best but also has a certain cost so let's look at all those methods and then it's up to you to decide which one makes more sense for your game if you prefer a more guided path with stepbystep lectures then check out my complete courses learn how to make a builder defender game using sharp just like i make my own steam games or learn how to make games internally using visual scripting or learn all about unity with the ultimate overview course which contains over 13 lectures each covering a different tool or feature of the engine to help you make better games faster i'm always available in the courses q a section answering your questions every single day so check out all the courses with the link in the description okay so let's look at various methods for achieving a zoom effect over here is my demo scene i've got a symbol character and i can just look around i've got my sniper rifle and i can press a button in order to bring it up now for the assets over here this is the cindy studios battleground pack there's a link description if you want to get it and for my reference script it's very basic all it does is just listen to some input and then set the animator parameter to play the animation pulling the rifle up or down and finally just got a bunch of events which we're going to hook into in order to do our various methods now if you don't know about events check out my video on it they are super useful okay so let's start by looking at the very first approach which is the easiest one and possibly the very first thing you would try now as you know cameras have a certain field of view and the easiest way to zoom is simply lower that field of view so for this first method let's first get a reference to our camera and when the rifle comes up we simply change the field of view let's put it on a lower amount and when the rifle goes down let me simply reset it and then i just added some buttons in order to zoom in and out so we can also modify these so that's it extremely simple let's see how this looks okay so here it is everything looks normal i bring the rifle up and there you go it zooms in so the camera is lowering the field of view so everything is zoomed in and as i press the button while i'm in here zoom in even further zoom back and so on and yep there you go it does work now to make this look a bit better we can animate it with lerp just like i covered in another video so here's just some basic warp logic so there it is pretty simple i just got a target film the view and that's the thing that changes and then i'm just using a meth.larp in order to lower from the current one onto the target so here it is looking normal i bring it up and there you go a nice and smooth zoom and i zoom in even further and there you go nice and smooth all right so here is the very first method as you can see it's extremely simple all it does is it just zooms in the main camera now the main benefit of this method is it's extremely performant so you don't have any extra shaders there's no extra cameras it is also extremely simple to implement you'll literally just change the camera fov and that's really it but the main downside is that it doesn't look too good ideally you would want just the scope to be zoomed in but in reality the whole screen zooms in so that doesn't look too good but so this is the very first easiest method which does work now for the second method for this one we're going to use a shader in order to zoom in on the area behind it now i actually made a separate video on this topic because it turned out quite a bit more tricky than i expected so in order to make this work i just place down a sphere directly inside of the scope there you go it's a physical object inside of there now this is a sphere i just made it really flat and then it is using this custom shader as you can see it's a very simple shader pretty small what it does is it takes the scene color so that is the colors of the scene on top of this object then it uses the telling and offset mode and modifies the telling in order to actually zoom in and finally the object screen position so this is the tricky thing you can go watch another video to learn how this works in more detail like i mentioned in that video the main issue was with the object screen position so this needs to be dynamically modified as the scope moves within the screen so for that i just have this other script all it does is just grab the camera world to screen point and feeds it onto the shader so this shader won't zoom in on everything behind it so it just needs to be positioned directly inside of the scope and for the logic itself over here the scope is just attached to the object so we don't need to actually modify anything here to script the only thing we need is over here on the zoom out and zoom in in order to modify the parameter on the actual shader so we just do this in order to modify the float variable inside the shader okay so that's it let's test alright so here it is and as i bring the rifle up yep look at that nice zoom so i can name anywhere and get a really nice zoomed in view for example i want to zoom in on that exposure down there and there you go i can do a really nice zoom in and if i press the button i can zoom in even further alright awesome so it does provide a nice zoomed in view now for the pros and cons of this method now the main pro when compared to the previous method is the fact that it only zooms in on the scope itself just like it should so the area behind it stays nice and normal now the next pro when compared to the following method that we're going to see compared to that one this one is much better in terms of performance so we just got a shader effect the camera just renders once and now of course for the cons there is one potentially huge con depending on when you zoom in and you can see it exactly like that if you zoom in just a small amount and everything looks pretty decent however the more you zoom in the more pixelated the image becomes now that has to do with the fact that the image resolution is fixed to the normal resolution so what this shader is doing is really just increasing the size that image it doesn't actually increase the image resolution so the further you zoom in the more pixelated and ugly it becomes so if you want just a small amount of zoom then it works pretty good but the more you take it the more intense it becomes there's a character all the way over there and there you go which is a pixelated mess okay so this is the second method it's

great so i'm looking there look in that corner yep looks great look at the character all the way over there yep i can see him and yep there you go the scope doesn't look great now for the pros and cons one of the pros is just like you said on this one i can zoom in exactly as much as i want and as you can see it doesn't have the pixelated problem like the previous method so i can clearly look that character all the way over there then this one also has an interesting property in that it works perfectly well even when the weapon is down so look at that even as i move i'm still seeing all the view over there so if i look all the way over here yep there you go you can see that my weapon is indeed pointed towards the barrel so that's an interesting nice bonus from this method now another pro is that since i'm using a second camera i can actually do some tricky things with it for example i can use a different post processing setup i can add a simple depth of field effect onto the main camera and with that since the render texture is close to the camera then it's not blurred but everything else is so there you go that's another very nice way so personally i think that this is the best visual of all everything else is blurry and the scope is really nice we're only zoomed in so i can see everything nice and clear then if you wanted you could push this even further in order to use a different post processing on the actual camera that is filming the zoom so you could essentially make the scope a thermal or a night vision while leaving the outer area looking normal now of course this approach does have one potential big con which is performance this is using a render texture in order to render the second camera so essentially the whole scene needs to be rendered twice for this to work now if you're making pc games and that's probably not too big of a cost but if you're making a mobile game then it does become a bit of an issue but if you can afford that performance then clearly this is the best method of all you've got two zooms one on the scope and one on the outside then you can zoom in further everything looks great nice effects everything looks awesome and again with this method when compared to the previous one you can zoom in a massive amount and everything looks nice and crisp alright so there you have it three methods for doing a rifle scope go with the first method if you need absolute performance or the simplest method possible go with the second one if you want to look a bit better than that and go with the final method if you want the absolute best visual as possible now go ahead and pick the right one for your game again if you're looking for a more guided path with stepbystep lectures then check out my complete courses alright
